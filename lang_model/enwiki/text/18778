'''Ischia'''  ({{IPA-it|<U+02C8>iskia}}) is a [[volcanic]] [[island]] in the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], at the northern end of the [[Gulf of Naples]]. The roughly trapezoidal island lies about 30&nbsp;km from [[Naples]] and measures around 10&nbsp;km east to west and 7&nbsp;km north to south with a {{convert|34|km}} coastline and a surface area of {{convert|46.3|km2}}. It is almost entirely mountainous, with the highest peak being [[Mount Epomeo]] at 788&nbsp;meters.<ref>''Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites''</ref> The island has a population of over 60,000&nbsp;people.

[[Ischia (comune)|Ischia Porto]] is the name of the main ''[[comune]]'' of the island. Other community areas include [[Barano d'Ischia]], [[Casamicciola Terme]], [[Forio]], [[Lacco Ameno]] and [[Serrara Fontana]].

The main industry is [[tourism]], centering on thermal spas that cater mostly to [[Europe]]an (especially German) and [[Asian people|Asian]] tourists eager to enjoy the fruits of the island's natural [[volcano|volcanic]] activity, its thermal hot springs, and its volcanic mud. For many of the inhabitants on the Italian-speaking island, German and English are second languages. This is because of the large number of German- and English-speaking tourists who visit the island each year. The Ferrandino Family, who still live on Ischia, are the rightful owners of the Castello Aragonese.

==Geography==
The roughly trapezoidal island is formed by a [[complex volcano]] immediately SW of the [[Campi Flegrei]] area at the western side of the [[Bay of Naples]]. The eruption of the [[trachyte|trachytic]] Green Tuff ignimbrite about 56,000&nbsp;years ago was followed by [[caldera]] formation. The high point on the island, 789-m-high Monte Epomeo, is a volcanic [[horst (geology)|horst]] composed of the Green Tuff [[ignimbrite]] deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then [[uplift]]ed. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least {{convert|800|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} of uplift has formed as a result of [[resurgent dome|resurgent doming]] during past 33,000&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0101-03=|title=Ischia}}</ref> Many small [[monogenetic volcano]]es were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous [[tephra]]s, [[tuff ring]]s, [[lava dome]]s, and [[lava flow]]s.<ref>{{cite gvp|vnum=0101-03=&volpage=synsub|title=Ischia: Synonyms and Subfeatures}}</ref> The latest eruption of Ischia, in 1302&nbsp;AD, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.

==Name==
[[Virgil]] poetically referred to it as ''Inarime'' and still later as ''Arime''.<ref>His poetical allusion was apparently to the mention in ''[[Iliad]]'' (ii.783) of [[Typhoeus]] being chained down ''ein Arimois''</ref> [[Martianus Capella]] followed Virgil in this allusive name, which was never in common circulation: the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called it ''Aenaria'', the Greeks, [[wikt:<U+03A0><U+03B9><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+1FE6><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>|<U+03A0><U+03B9><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+1FE6><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03B9>]], ''Pitheko<U+016B>sai''.<ref>The plural likely so as to include nearby [[Procida]] as well.</ref>

''(In)arime'' and ''Pithekousai'' both appear to derive from words for "monkey" ([[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''arimos'',<ref>''Lost Languages: The Enigma of the World's Undechiphered Scripts''. Robinson, Andrew. Nevraumont Publishing. 2002.</ref> [[Ancient Greek]] [[wikt:<U+03C0><U+03AF><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+03C0><U+03AF><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>]], ''p<U+00ED>th<U+0113>kos'', "monkey"). However, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] derives the Greek name from the local ceramic clay deposits, not from ''p<U+00ED>th<U+0113>kos''; he explains the Latin name ''Aenaria'' as connected to a landing by [[Aeneas]] (''Princeton Encyclopedia'').  If the island actually was, like [[Gibraltar]], home to a population of monkeys, they were already extinct by historical times as no record of them is mentioned in ancient sources.

The current name appears for the first time in a letter from [[Pope Leo III]] to [[Charlemagne]] in 813 (''iscla'' from ''insula'') though there is an argument made for a [[Semitic]] origin in ''I-schra'', "black island".

==History==
===Ancient times===
An acropolis site of the Monte Vico area was inhabited from the [[Bronze Age]], as [[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] and Iron Age pottery finds attest. [[Euboea]]n Greeks from [[Eretria]] and [[Chalcis]] arrived in the 8th century BC to establish an [[emporium]] for trade with the [[Etruscans]] of the mainland. This settlement was home not only to Greeks, but a mixed population of Greek, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Phoenicia]]n inhabitants. Because of its fine harbor and the safety from raids afforded by the sea, the settlement of Pithecusae became successful through trade in iron and with mainland Italy; at its peak, Pithecusae was home to about 10,000&nbsp;people.

The ceramic Euboean artifact inscribed with a reference to "[[Nestor's cup]]" was discovered in a grave on the island in 1953. Engraved upon the cup are a few lines written in the [[Greek alphabet]]. Dating from c. [[730 BC]], it is one of our most important testimonies to the early Greek alphabet, from which our own Latin alphabet descends via the Etruscan alphabet. The inscription also seems to be the oldest written reference to the [[Iliad]].

In [[474 BC]], [[Hiero I of Syracuse]] came to the aid of the Cumaeans, who lived on the mainland opposite Ischia, against the [[Etruscans]] and defeated them on the sea. He occupied Ischia and the surrounding [[Parthenope]]an islands and left behind a garrison to build a fortress before the city of Ischia itself. This was still extant in the [[Middle Ages]], but the original garrison fled before the eruptions of [[470 BC]] and the island was taken over by Neapolitans. The Romans seized Ischia (and Naples) in [[322 BC]].

===Christian era until the 16th century===
In 6&nbsp;AD, [[Augustus]] restored the island to Naples in exchange for [[Capri]]. Ischia suffered from the [[barbarian]] invasions, being taken first by the [[Heruli]] then by the [[Ostrogoths]], being ultimately absorbed into the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The Byzantines gave the island over to Naples in 588 and by 661 it was being administered by a [[Count]] liege to the [[Duke of Naples]]. The area was devastated by the [[Saracens]] in 813 and 847; in 1004 it was occupied by [[Henry II of Germany]]; the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Roger II of Sicily]] took it in 1130 granting the island to the Norman Aldoyn de Candida created Count d<U+2019>Ischia; the island was raided by the [[Pisa]]ns in 1135 and 1137 and subsequently fell under the [[Suebi]] and then [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] rule. After the [[Sicilian Vespers]] in 1282, the island rebelled, recognizing [[Peter III of Aragon]], but was retaken by the Angevins the following year. It was conquered in 1284 by the forces of Aragon and [[Charles II of Naples|Charles II]] of [[Anjou]] was unable to successfully retake it until 1299.

[[File:Ischia mushroom rock.jpg|thumb|Local view, ''The Fungo'' (mushroom)]]
  
As a consequence of the island's last eruption, the population fled to [[Baiae|Baia]] where they remained for 4&nbsp;years. In 1320 [[Robert of Anjou]] and his wife Sancia visited the island and were hosted by [[Cesare Sterlich]], who had been sent by Charles II from the [[Holy See]] to govern the island in 1306 and was by this time nearly 100&nbsp;years of age.

Ischia suffered greatly in the struggles between the Angevin and Durazzo dynasties. It was taken by [[Carlo Durazzo]] in 1382, retaken by [[Louis II of Anjou]] in 1385 and captured yet again by [[Ladislav Durazzo]] in 1386; it was sacked by the fleet of the [[Antipope John XXIII]] under the command of Gaspare Cossa in 1410 only to be retaken by Ladislav the following year. In 1422 [[Joan II of Naples|Joan II]] gave the island to her adoptive son [[Alfonso V of Aragon]], though, when he fell into disgrace, she retook it with the help of [[Genoa]] in 1424. In 1438 Alfonso reoccupied the castle, kicking out all the men and proclaiming it a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] [[colony]], marrying to his garrison the wives and daughters of the expelled. He set about building a bridge linking the castle to the rest of the island and he carved out a large gallery, both of which are still to be seen today. In 1442, he gave the island to one of his favorites, [[Lucretia d'Alagno]], who in turn entrusted the island's governance to her brother-in-law, [[Giovanni Torella]]. Upon the death of Alfonso in 1458, they returned the island to the Angevin side.  [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] ordered Alessandro [[Sforza]] to chase Torella out of the castle and gave the island over, in 1462, to Garceraldo Requesens. In 1464, after a brief Torellan insurrection, Marino Caracciolo was set up as governor.

In February 1495, with the arrival of [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], [[Ferdinand II of Naples|Ferdinand II]] landed on the island and took possession of the castle, and, after having killed the disloyal [[castellan]] Giusto di Candida with his own hands, left the island under the control of [[Innico d'Avalos]], marquis of [[Pescara]] and [[Vasto]], who ably defended the place from the French [[flotilla]]. With him came his sister Costanza and through them they founded the D'Avalos dynasty which would last on the island into the eighteenth century.

===16th-18th centuries===
Throughout the 15th century, the island suffered the incursions of [[pirate]]s and [[Barbary]] [[privateers]] - in 1543 and 1544 [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] laid waste to the island, taking 4,000 prisoners in the process. In 1548 and 1552, Ischia was beset by his successor [[Dragut Rais]]. With the increasing rarity and diminishing severity of the piratical attacks later in the century and the construction of better defenses, the islanders began to venture out of the castle and it was then that the historic centre of the town of Ischia was begun. Even so, many inhabitants still ended up slaves to the pirates, the last known being taken in 1796. During the 1647 revolution of [[Masaniello]], there was an attempted rebellion against the feudal landowners.

===From 18th century until today===
With the extinction of the D'Avalos line in 1729, the island reverted to state property. In March, 1734 it was taken by the [[Bourbons]] and administered by a royal governor seated within the castle. The island participated in the short-lived [[Republic of Naples]] starting in March, 1799 but by April 3, Commodore [[Thomas Troubridge]] under the command of [[Lord Nelson]] had put down the revolt on Ischia as well as on neighboring [[Procida]]. By decree of the governor, many of the rebels were hung in a square on Procida now called Piazza dei martiri (Square of the Martyrs). Among these was [[Francesco Buonocore]] who had received the island to administer from the French [[Championnet]] in Naples. On February 13, 1806, the island was occupied by the French and on the 24th was unsuccessfully attacked by the English.

On July 28, 1883, an earthquake destroyed the villages of [[Casamicciola Terme]] and [[Lacco Ameno]].

In 1936 Ischia had a population of 30,418.<ref>''Columbia-Lippincott Gazeteer'', p. 849</ref>

Today, Ischia is a popular tourist destination, welcoming up to 6&nbsp;million visitors per year, mainly from the Italian mainland as well as Germany (approximately 5,000 Germans are resident on the island), although it has become an increasingly popular destination for the well-to-do Eastern Europeans (particularly Russia and Poland). Ischia is easily reached by ferry from Naples, with an approximate travel time of between 40&nbsp;minutes and one &nbsp;hour. The number of thermal spas on the islands makes it particularly popular with tourists seeking "wellness" holidays.

==Ischia in literature and the arts==
The [[UK|British]] classical composer [[William Walton]] settled in Ischia in 1949 and lived on the island for the remainder of his life, dying there in 1983.

In 1948, American author [[Truman Capote]] stayed in room number 3 in the Pensione Lustro in the town of Forio on the island. He wrote an essay about his stay there, which later appeared in ''Local Color'', published in 1950 by [[Random House]].

Parts of the Hollywood film ''[[The Talented Mr Ripley]]'' were filmed on the island. Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]] lived on the island for a short period, and is said to have finished [[Peer Gynt]] there in 1867. The Hollywood Hit ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' was also filmed on the island. French novelist [[Pascal Quignard]] set much of his book ''[[Villa Amalia (book)|Villa Amalia]]'' on the island. ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' with [[Elizabeth Taylor]] was also filmed on the island.

[[Herg<U+00E9>]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' ends in Ischia, which serves as the location of [[Endaddine Akass]]'s villa in the unfinished book ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]''.  [[W.H. Auden]] wrote his poem "[[In Praise of Limestone]]" here.

==Main sights==
[[File:Castello Aragonese.jpg|thumb|Castello Aragonese.]]

===Aragonese Castle===
{{Coord|40|43|52|N|13|57|55|E}}

The [[Aragon]]ese Castle (''Castello Aragonese'', Ischia Ponte) was built on a rock near the island in [[474 BC]], by [[Hiero I of Syracuse]]. At the same time, two towers were built to control enemy fleets'  movements. The rock was then occupied by [[Parthenopeans]] (the ancient inhabitants of [[Naples]]). In [[326 BC]] the fortress was captured by [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and then again by the Parthenopeans. In 1441 [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] connected the rock to the island with a stone bridge instead of the prior wood bridge, and fortified the walls in order to defend the inhabitants against the raids of [[pirates]]. Around 1700, about 2000 families lived on the islet, including a [[larisses]] Convent, the Abbey of Basilians from Greece, the Bishop and the Seminar, the Prince with a military garrison. There were also thirteen churches. In 1912, the Castle was sold to a private owner. Today the castle is the most visited monument of the island. It is accessed through a tunnel with large openings which let the light enter. Along the tunnel there is a small chapel consecrated to [[Saint John Joseph of the Cross]] (San Giovan Giuseppe della Croce), the [[patron saint]] of the island. A more comfortable access is also possible with a modern lift. After arriving outside, it is possible to visit the Church of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immacolata]] and the Cathedral of [[Assunta]]. The first was built in 1737 on the location of a smaller chapel dedicated to Saint Francis, and closed after the suppression of Convents in 1806 as well as the Nunnery of Clarisses.

===Gardens of ''La Mortella''===
The gardens, located in Forio-San Francesco, were originally the property of English composer [[William Walton]]. Bus-stop 41 on the CS or #1 bus routes. Walton lived in the villa next to the gardens with his Argentinian wife [[Susana Walton|Susana]]. When the composer arrived on the island in 1946, he immediately called [[Russell Page]] from England to lay out the garden. Wonderful tropical and Mediterranean plants were planted and some have now reached amazing proportions. The gardens include wonderful views over the city and harbour of Forio. A museum dedicated to the life and work of William Walton now comprises part of the garden complex. There's also a recital room where renowned musical artists perform on a regular schedule.

===Gardens of ''Villa Ravino''===
A botanical garden, located in Forio-Citara Bay, resulting of 50 years of great passion and loving work of Captain Giuseppe D'Ambra, the owner of the Villa. '''Giardini Ravino [[Giardini Ravino]]''' is a botanical garden with one of the richest collection of cacti and succulents cultivated outdoors in Europe. Giardini Ravino has been awarded from the OPE (European Parliamentary Observatory) as the most ecofriendly property in South Italy. 
Giardini Ravino is also the location of Meristema Fair, an exhibition dedicated to both professional and quality amateur gardeners, enriched with seminars and hands on experiences handling and discussing for varius reasons about biodiversity in nature.
Giardini Ravino is also the headquarter of many social associations that organises events, in collaboration with international humanitarian aid organizations, as MSF (Doctors Without Frontiers),  the no-profit eno-gastronomic member-supported organization "Slowfood" and many other cultural exhibitions during the year around. 
Bus-stop "Via Bocca" on the CS, #1 or #2 bus routes.

===Villa La Colombaia===
''Villa La Colombaia'' is located in Lacco Ameno and Forio territories. Surrounded by a park, the villa (called "The Dovecote") was made by [[Luigi Patalano]], a famous local [[socialist]] and [[Journalism|journalist]]. It is now the seat of a cultural institution and museum dedicated to [[Luchino Visconti]]. The institution promotes cultural activities such as music, cinema, theatre, art exhibitions, work-shops, and cinema reviews. The villa and the park are open to the public.

== Town twinning==
Ischia has had a [[town twinning|twin town]] relationship with [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]], since 1984, although the relationship is presently inactive.<ref name="dept">[http://www.cambridgema.gov/deptann.cfm?story_id=1597 "A Message from the Peace Commission: Information on Cambridge's Sister Cities,"] February 15, 2008.

Many migrants from Ischia also settled in the port town San Pedro, California, the college town of Princeton, New Jersey and Fairfield County, Connecticut.

==Environmental Problems==

On 14 June 2007, there was a breakage in one of the four high<U+2011>voltage underwater cables forming the power line maintained by Enel S.p.A <U+2014> although never authorized by Italian authorities <U+2014> between Cuma on the Campania coast and Lacco Ameno on the island of Ischia. Inside each cable there is an 18&nbsp;mm<U+2011>diameter channel filled with oil under high pressure.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2008-3253+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN Subject: Environmental catastrophe in Ischia]</ref>

The breakage of the Enel cable resulted in the spillage of oil into the sea and into other environmental matrices <U+2014> with the consequent pollution by polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs, the use of which was banned by the Italian authorities as long ago as 1984), aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons (APHs) and linear alkyl benzenes (aromatic hydrocarbons) <U+2014> in the <U+2018>Regno di Nettuno<U+2019> a marine protected area, and the largest ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea, designated as a <U+2018>priority habitat<U+2019> in Annex I to the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and comprising oceanic posidonia beds.
