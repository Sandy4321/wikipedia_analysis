|    ShortSummary = Having recognized that Tsunade's healing jutsu was filled with killing intent, Kabuto realized that she had no intention of helping Orochimaru. With Tsunade being the only person who can heal Orochimaru, they decide to take her by force, and Kabuto and Tsunade begin to fight. Although Tsunade has far more battle experience than Kabuto, he is able to hold his own against her, even managing to land a few debilitating attacks. As Kabuto prepares to put Tsunade out of commission, Naruto, Jiraiya, and Tsunade's assistant, [[List of Konoha ninja#Shizune|Shizune]], arrive to help.

|    ShortSummary = Uninterested in their assistance, Tsunade tries to resume her battle with Kabuto, though he slits his wrist, paralyzing her due to her fear of blood. As she is taken aside to recover, Jiraiya battles Orochimaru while Naruto and Shizune battle Kabuto. Due to the drug Tsunade gave him, Jiraiya is unable to properly control his chakra and his jutsu are underpowered, and is stalemated against the similarly impaired Orochimaru. Kabuto, on the other hand, quickly dispatches Naruto and Shizune, and returns his attention to Tsunade. Before he can harm her, Naruto appears and blocks his attack. Using a shadow clone for assistance, Naruto grabs hold of Kabuto and delivers a perfect Rasengan to his stomach.

When Naruto collapses due to the severity of Kabuto's last attack, Tsunade does what she can, determined to save him. Her efforts work, and he regains consciousness long enough to claim the necklace he has won. Orochimaru, recognizing Naruto as a potential future threat, tries to kill him. Tsunade, determined to make sure Naruto becomes Hokage, overcomes her fear of blood and uses herself as a human shield to block the attack. When asked why she would risk her life to save him, Tsunade replies that it is her duty as the Fifth Hokage, finally accepting the role she was offered. Intending to eliminate his former teammates, Orochimaru summons [[List of Naruto summons#Snakes|Manda]] while Tsunade and Jiraiya summon [[List of Naruto summons#Katsuyu|Katsuyu]] and Gamabunta respectively.

Once Naruto recovers and learns of Tsunade's acceptance of the Hokage title, he remarks that she is an undeserving of the job due to the fact that the Third was better in every possible way. The two step outside to have another fight, though this time Tsunade gives Naruto a kiss on the forehead instead of a blow to the face. The group then sets off for Konoha.
