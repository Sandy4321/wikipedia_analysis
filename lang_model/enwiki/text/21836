'''Tak'alik A'baj'''' is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] site, formerly known as '''Abaj Takalik'''. It is one of several [[Mesoamerica]]n sites with both [[Olmec]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] features.  The site flourished in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Pre-Classic]] and Classic eras, from the [[9th century BC]] through to at least the 10th century AD, and was an important commerce centre,<ref>Love 2007, p.297. Popenoe de Hatch 2005, pp.992, 994.</ref> trading with [[Kaminaljuyu]] and [[Chocol<U+00E1>]]. Investigations have revealed that it is one of the largest sites with sculptured monuments on the Pacific coastal plain.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.236.</ref> Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, [[petroglyph]]s and others.<ref>Love 2007, p.288.</ref> The site has one of the greatest concentrations of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the [[Gulf of Mexico]].<ref>Love 2007, p.288.</ref>

Takalik Abaj is representative of the first blossoming of Maya culture that had occurred by about 400 BC.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.33.</ref> Excavation is continuing at the site; the monumental architecture and long sequence of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site is of some importance.<ref>Adams 1996, p.81.</ref>

==Etymology==
The name means "Standing Stone" in the local [[K'iche' language|K'iche']] [[Maya language]], from ''tak<U+2019>alik'' (adj) meaning "standing" and ''ab<U+00E4>j'' (n) meaning "stone" or "rock".<ref>Christenson; Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26.</ref> Tak'alik A'baj was named ''Abaj Takalik'' by American archaeologist Susanna Miles,<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26. Note that Miles's first name is given variously as Suzanna (Kelly 1996, p.215.), Susanna (Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.) and Susan (Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26.)</ref> using Spanish word order. This is grammatically incorrect in K'iche';<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26.</ref> the Guatemalan government has now officially corrected this to ''Tak'alik A'baj'''. The ancient name of the site is as yet unknown.

[[Image:Larger Southern Maya area v3.svg|left|400px|thumb|Takalik Abaj with relation to the Olmec heartland.]]

==Location==
The site lies in the southwest of [[Guatemala]], about 45km (28 miles) from the international border with [[Mexico]]<ref>Sharer 2000, p.467. Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> and 40km (25 miles) from the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref>

Takalik Abaj is located in the north of the municipality of [[El Asintal]], in the extreme north of the [[Retalhuleu Department]] of Guatemala, some 120 miles (190 km) from [[Guatemala City]].<ref>Zetina Aldana and Escobar 1994, p.3. Kelly 1996, p.210. Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref>  The site lies among five coffee plantations in the lower foothills of the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] mountains; the Santa Margarita, San Isidro Piedra Parada, Buenos Aires, San El<U+00ED>as and Dolores plantations.<ref>Zetina Aldana and Escobar 1994, p.3. Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref> Takalik Abaj sits upon a ridge running north-south, sloping in a southwards direction.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> This ridge is bordered on the west by the river Nim<U+00E1> and on the east by the river Ixchay<U+00E1>, both flowing down from the [[Guatemalan Highlands]].<ref>Zetina Aldana and Escobar 1994, p.3.</ref> The Ixchay<U+00E1> flows in a deep ravine but a suitable crossing point is located near to the site. The situation of Takalik Abaj at this crossing point was probably important in the founding of the city, since this channeled important trade routes through the site and controlled access to them.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref>

Takalik Abaj sits at an altitude of approximately {{convert|600|m|ft}} above sea level in an area classed as [[subtropical moist forest]].<ref>Zetina Aldana and Escobar 1994, p.3. Rizzo de Robles 1991, p.32.</ref> The temperature normally varies between 21<U+00B0>C and 25<U+00B0>C (70<U+00B0>F and 77<U+00B0>F).<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, p.171.</ref> The area receives high annual rainfall, varying between {{convert|2136|and|4372|mm|in|0}}, with an average annual rainfall of {{convert|3284|mm|in|0}}.<ref>Zetina Aldana and Escobar 1994, p.18.</ref> Local vegetation includes the Pascua de Monta<U+00F1>a (''Pogonopus spesiosus''), Chichique (''Aspidosperma megalocarpum''), Tepecaulote (''Leuhea speciosa''), Caulote or West Indian Elm (''Guazuma ulminofolia''), Hormigo (''Platymiscium dimorphandrum''), [[Mexican Cedar]] (''Cedrela mexicana''), [[Breadnut]] (''Brosimum'' sp.), [[Tamarind]] (''Tamarindus indica'') and Papaturria (''[[Coccoloba montana]]'').<ref>Rizzo de Robles 1991, p.33.</ref>

A road passes the site, denominated 6W, running {{convert|30|km|mi}} from the town of [[Retalhuleu]] to [[Colomba|Colomba Costa Cuca]] in the department of [[Quetzaltenango (department)|Quetzaltenango]].<ref>Zetina Aldana and Escobar 1994, p.3. Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref>

Takalik Abaj is located at an approximate distance of 100km (62 miles) from the contemporary archaeological site of [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]], 130km (81 miles) from [[Kaminaljuyu]] and 60km (37 miles) from [[Izapa]] in Mexico.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.24.</ref>

[[Image:Formative Period southern Mesoamerica 2.svg|right|400px|thumb|Takalik Abaj and other Preclassic sites on the Pacific coast.]]

==Ethnicity==
The Middle Preclassic population of Takalik Abaj may have been speakers of Mixe-Zoque, the language associated with the Olmecs.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239. Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref> After the Maya intrusion into the site in the Late Preclassic the inhabitants presumably spoke a Maya language, although the exact one has not yet been identified.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.996.</ref> There are some hints from the indigenous chronicles that the inhabitants of the site may have been the Yoc Cancheb, a branch of the [[Mam people|Mam]] Maya.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.996.</ref>

==Economy and trade==
Takalik Abaj was one of a series of sites on the Pacific coastal plain that were important commercial, ceremonial and political centres. It is apparent that it prospered from the production of cacao and from the trade routes that crossed the region.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.455.</ref> At the time of the [[Spanish Conquest]] the area was still important for its production of [[cacao]].<ref>Coe 1999, p.64.</ref>

Study of [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] recovered at Takalik Abaj indicates that the majority originated from the [[El Chayal]] and [[San Mart<U+00ED>n Jilotepeque]] sources. Lesser quantities of obsidian originated from other sources such as [[Tajumulco]], [[Ixtepeque]] and [[Pachuca]].<ref>Crasborn 2005, p.696.</ref> The proportion of obsidian from different sources varied over time:

==History==
Although Takalik Abaj was first occupied in the Early Preclassic, it was not until the Middle to Late Preclassic that it experienced its first real florescence with a surge in architectural activity.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> The site has a very long occupational history with principal occupation stretching from the Middle Preclassic right through to the Postclassic. During this time there was a continuity of population as represented by the local Ocosito ceramic style, which continued in use from the Preclassic to the Late Classic, in the Terminal Classic to Early Postclassic the Ocosito style first mixed with, and then was absorbed by, the highland [[K'iche']] ceramic style.<ref>Popenhoe de Hatch 2005, pp.992-3.</ref>

===Early Preclassic===
Takalik Abaj was first occupied in the Early Preclassic period, around 1000-800 BC.<ref>Crasborn 2005, p.696.</ref> The remains of an Early Preclassic residential area have been found to the west of the Central Group, on the bank of the El Chorro stream. These first houses were built with floors made from river cobbles and reed-thatched roofs supported on timber poles.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, pp.405, 411.</ref> [[Pollen analysis]] has revealed that the first inhabitants entered the area when it was still thick forest, which they began to clear in order to cultivate [[maize]] and other plants.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2004, p.424.</ref> Over 150 pieces of obsidian have been recovered from this area, known as El Escondite, mostly originating from the San Mart<U+00ED>n Jilotepeque and El Chayal sources.<ref>Crasborn 2005, p.696.</ref>

===Middle Preclassic===
Around 1000 BC,<ref>Love 2007, p.288.</ref> at the beginning of the Middle Preclassic, Takalik Abaj was reoccupied.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> This was probably by [[Mixe-Zoque languages|Mixe-Zoquean]] inhabitants, as evidenced by the plentiful Olmec-style sculpture at the site dating to this period.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239. Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref> The construction of public architecture had probably begun by the Middle Preclassic;<ref>Love 2007, p.288.</ref> the earliest structures were made of clay, which was sometimes partially burned in order to harden it.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> Ceramics from this period belong to the local Ocosito tradition.<ref>Love 2007, p.288.</ref> This ceramic tradition, although it is local, shows strong affinities with the ceramics of the coastal plain and foothills of the [[Escuintla (department)|Escuintla]] region.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref>

Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.248.</ref>  Click [[:File:Takalik Abaj Stela 5.JPG|here]] for a photo of this stela.]]

===Late Preclassic===
During the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Preclassic]] various sites in the Pacific coastal region grew to become a true cities; Takalik Abaj was one of these, with an area greater than 4km<U+00B2>.<ref>Love 2007, pp.291-2.</ref> The cessation of Olmec influence upon the Pacific coastal zone occurred at the beginning of the Late Preclassic.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref> At this time Takalik Abaj emerged as an important centre with an apparently local style of art and architecture;<ref>Miller 2001, p.59.</ref> the inhabitants began to make boulder sculptures and to erect stelae and associated altars.<ref>Miller 2001, pp.61-2.</ref> Monuments were erected with both political and religious significance, some of which bore Maya style dates and depictions of rulers.<ref>Adams 2000, p.31.</ref> These early Maya monuments are carved with what may be the earliest Maya hieroglyphic inscruptions and use of the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]].<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref> The so-called potbelly style of sculpture also appeared at this time.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref> The appearance of Maya sculpture and the cessation of Olmec-style sculpture may represent a Maya intrusion into the area, which was previously occupied by Mixe-Zoquean inhabitants.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239. Love 2007, p.293.</ref> Maya elites may have entered the area in order to take control of the cacao trade.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref> However, there was a continuity in local ceramic styles from the Middle to Late Preclassic and the change from Olmec to Maya may have been ideological rather than physical.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref> If they arrived from elsewhere, the finds of Maya stelae and a Maya royal tomb suggest that the Maya were in a dominant position, whether they arrived as traders or conquerors.<ref>Love 2007, p.297.</ref>

There is evidence of increasing contact with [[Kaminaljuyu]], which emerged as a principal centre at this time, linking the Pacific coastal trade routes with the [[Motagua River]] route, as well as increased contact with other sites along the Pacific coast. <ref>Love 2007, pp.293, 297. Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref> Within this extended trade route, Takalik Abaj and Kaminaljuyu appear to have been the two principal foci.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref> The early Maya style of sculpture spread throughout this network.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref>

During the Late Preclassic structures were built using volcanic stone held together with clay, as in the Middle Preclassic.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref>

Although the Ocosito ceramic tradition continued in use,<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref> the Late Preclassic ceramics in Takalik Abaj were strongly related to the Miraflores Ceramic Sphere that included Escuintla, the [[Valley of Guatemala]] and western [[El Salvador]].<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991.</ref>

===Early Classic===
In the Early Classic, around the second century AD, the stela style that developed at Takalik Abaj and was associated with the portrayal of historic figures was adopted across the Maya lowlands, particularly in the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin]].<ref>Miller 2001, pp.64-5.</ref> During this period some of the pre-existing monuments were deliberately destroyed.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210. Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993.</ref>

In this period, the ceramics show a change with the entry of the highland Solano style.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993.</ref> This style of ceramics has been associated with the highland K'iche' Maya.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.996.</ref> These new ceramics did not replace the pre-existing Ocosito complex but rather became mingled with them.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993.</ref>

Archaeological investigations have shown that the destruction of monuments and interruption of new construction at the site occurred simultaneously with the arrival of so-called Naranjo style ceramics, which appear to be linked to styles from the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the distant [[Valley of Mexico]].<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993.</ref> At the same time, the use of local Ocosito ceramics waned. This Teotihuacan influence places the destruction of monuments in the second half of the Early Classic.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993.</ref> The presence of the conquerors linked to the Naranjo-style ceramics was not of long duration and suggests that the conquerors exerted long-distance control of the site, replacing the local rulers with their own governors while leaving the local population intact.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.993-4.</ref>

The conquest of Takalik Abaj broke the ancient trade routes running along the Pacific coast from Mexico to El Salvador, these were replaced by a new route running up the Sierra Madre and into the northwestern Guatemalan highlands.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.992.</ref>

[[Image:TakalikAbajStructure12.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Structure 12, dating to the Early Classic.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.212.</ref>]]

===Late Classic===
In the Late Classic the site appears to have recovered from its earlier defeat. Naranjo-style ceramics diminish greatly in quantity and there was a surge in new large-scale construction. Many monuments broken by the conquerors were re-erected at this time.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.994</ref>

===Postclassic===
Although use of the local Ocosito-style ceramics continued, in the Postclassic Period there was a marked intrusion of [[K'iche']] ceramics from the highlands, concentrated particularly in the northern part of the site but extending to cover the whole.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.994. Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.993.</ref> The indigenous accounts of the K'iche' themselves claim that they conquered this region of the Pacific coast, suggesting that the presence of their ceramics is associated with their conquest of Takalik Abaj.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.994.</ref>

The K'iche' conquest appears to have taken place around AD 1000, some four centuries earlier than had been supposed using calculations based on the indigenous accounts.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, pp.992, 994.</ref> It did not cause any pause in activity at the site; after the initial arrival of the K'iche' the local styles were simply replaced by the styles associated with the conquerors.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.993.</ref> This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.997.</ref>

===Modern history===
The first published account appeared in 1888, written by Gustav Bruhl.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> Karl Sapper described Stela 1 in 1894 after he saw it beside the road he was travelling.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> Max Vollmberg, a German artist, drew Stela 1 and noted some other monuments, which attracted the interest of Walter Lehmann.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref>

In 1902 the eruption of the nearby [[Santa Mar<U+00ED>a (volcano)|Santiaguito]] volcano covered the site in a layer of volcanic ash that varies between {{convert|40|and|50|cm|in}} thick.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, p.172.</ref>

Walter Lehmann began the study of the sculptures of Takalik Abaj in the 1920s.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> In January of 1942 [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] visited the site with Ralph L. Roys and William Webb on behalf of the [[Carnegie Institution]] while undertaking a study of the Pacific Coast,<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.26.</ref> publishing his accounts in 1943.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> Further investigations were undertaken by Susanna Miles, Lee Parsons and Edwin Shook.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> In 1965 Susanna Miles named the site as Abaj Takalik, previously it had been known by various names, including San Isidro Piedra Parada and Santa Margarita, after the names of the plantations in which the site lies, and also by the name of [[Colomba]], a village to the north in the department of [[Quetzaltenango department|Quetzaltenango]].<ref>Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref>

Excavations at the site in the 1970s were sponsored by the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> They began in 1976 and were undertaken by John A. Graham, Robert F. Heizer and Edwin M. Shook.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> This first season uncovered 40 new monuments, including Stela 5, to add to the dozen or so already known.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> Excavations by the University of California at Berkeley continued until 1981 and uncovered even more monuments in that time.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> From 1987 excavations have been continued by the Guatemalan [[Instituto de Antropolog<U+00ED>a e Historia]] under the direction of Miguel Orrego and Christa Schieber, and new monuments continue to be uncovered.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239. Kelly 1996, p.215.</ref> The site has been declared a national park.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref>

[[Image:TakalikAbajDrainage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Stone channel to carry runoff from the major architecture.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref>]]

==The site==
The core of the site covers about {{convert|6.5|km2|mi2}},<ref>Wolley 2002, p.365.</ref> with remains of some 70 monumental structures around a dozen plazas grouped on nine terraces.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1006. Wolley 2002, p.365.</ref> Takalik Abaj has 2 [[Mesoamerican ballcourts|ballcourts]] and over 239 known stone monuments,<ref>Wolley 2002, p.365.</ref> including impressive stelae and altars. The granite used to make monuments in [[Olmec]] and early Maya styles is much different from the soft limestone used in the [[Pet<U+00E9>n]] cities.<ref>Tarpy 2004.</ref>. The site is also noted for its hydraulic systems, including a ''[[temazcal]]'' or sauna bath with a subterranean drainage, and Preclassic tombs recently found there by Drs. Marion Popenoe de Hatch, Christa Schieber de Lavarreda and Miguel Orrego, from the [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala]].

Takalik Abaj is divided into four groups; the Central, North and West Groups are clustered together but the South Group is located about 5km (3 miles) to the south.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> The site is naturally defensible, being bordered by steep ravines<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1006.</ref> The site occupies a series of nine terraces, which vary in width from {{convert|140|to|220|m|ft}} and have faces varying in height from {{convert|4.6|to|9.4|m|ft}}.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1006.</ref> These terraces do not have a uniform orientation, rather the direction of their retaining face depends upon the local terrain.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1006.</ref> The three main terraces supporting the city are artificial, with over {{convert|10|m|ft}} of fill being used in places.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref>

When Takalik Abaj was at its greatest extent, major architecture in the city covered an area of approximately {{convert|2|by|4|km|mi}}, although the area occupied by residential construction has not been determined.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref>

*The '''Central Group'''  occupies Terraces 1 through to 5, which were artificially levelled.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref>

*The '''West Group''' consists of sixteen structures on Terrace 6, which was artificially levelled. The West Group is bordered by the rivers Nima on the west and the San Isidro on the east. A notable find in the West Group was the discovery of some jade masks there.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1007, 1010. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref>

*The '''North Group''' was occupied from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1006-7.</ref> The structures in this group differ in their method of construction from those in the central group, being made of compacted clay without any stone construction or facing.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref> The group occupies Terraces 7 through to 9, which do not show evidence of much levelling, rather they use the natural terraces already present.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref> The North Group has no sculptured monuments and this combined with the different construction methods and ceramic finds implies that the North Group was occupied by new inhabitants that arrived in the Late Classic, probably K'iche' Maya from the highlands.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref>

===Water control===
The hydraulic system included stone canals, which were not used for irrigation but rather to channel runoff and maintain the structural integrity of the principal architecture.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref> These channels were also used to carry water to the residential areas of the city,<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, p.955.</ref> and it is possible that the channels also served a ritual purpose.<ref>Love 2007, p.293.</ref> So far, the remains of 25 channels have been found at the site.<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, p.956.</ref> The larger channels measure {{convert|0.25|m|in|0}} wide by {{convert|0.30|m|in}} high, secondary channels measure about half that.<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, pp.956-7.</ref>

There are two methods of construction used for the water channels. Clay channels date from the Middle Preclassic while stone-lined channels date from the Late Preclassic through to the Classic, with stone-lined channels from the Late Classic being the largest channels built at the site. In the Late Classic pieces of broken stone monuments were reused in the construction of the water channels.<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, pp.957-8.</ref>

[[Image:TakalikAbajView2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plaza upon one of the terraces of Takalik Abaj.]]

===Terraces===
*'''Terrace 2''' is in the Central Group.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2004, p.410.</ref> Structures on this terrace date as far back as the Middle Preclassic and include an early example of a [[Mesoamerican ballcourts|ballcourt]].<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 1994, pp.73-4.</ref>

*'''Terrace 3''' is in the Central Group.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2004, p.410.</ref> The facade represented a major construction project and dates to the Late Preclassic.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, p.176.</ref>

*'''Terrace 5''' is on the eastern side of the site immediately to the north of the Central Group. It measures {{convert|200|m|ft}} east to west and {{convert|300|m|ft}} north to south. Terrace 5 is on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation and is currently used for the cultivation of coffee. The retaining face of the terrace was built of compacted clay during the Late Preclassic and represented an enormous inversion of labour. This terrace continued in use until the Postclassic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1008-9. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref>

*'''Terrace 6''' supports the 16 structures of the West Group. It measures {{convert|150|m|ft}} from east to west and {{convert|140|m|ft}} from north to south. The terrace shows various phases of construction, it overlies a substructure built from large worked blocks of [[basalt]] which dates to the Late Preclassic, later phases of construction date to the Late Classic and the terrace has traces of the Postclassic K'iche' occupation of the site. The terrace lies within the San Isidro Piedra Parada and Buenos Aires plantations and the land is currently dedicated to the cultivation of rubber and coffee. A modern road cuts the eastern corner of Terrace 6.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1010-11.</ref>

*'''Terrace 7''' is a natural terrace that supports a part of the North Group. It runs east-west and is {{convert|475|m|ft}} long. It supports 15 structures dating from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic and associated with the K'iche' occupation of the site. This terrace lies between the Buenos Aires and San El<U+00ED>as plantations and the eastern part has been cut by a modern road.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref>

*'''Terrace 8''' is another natural terrace in the North Group. It also runs east west and is {{convert|400|m|ft}} long. A modern road has cut the eastern part of the terrace and the western side of Structure 46 upon its edge. The terrace supports only this structure and one other to the north (Structure 54). The terrace was probably a residential area with cultivated land associated with the North Group. This terrace is associated with the K'iche' occupation of the site from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref>

*'''Terrace 9''' is the largest terrace at Takalik Abaj and supports part of the North Group. It is approximately {{convert|400|m|ft}} running east-west and {{convert|300|m|ft}}. The retaining face of the terrace runs immediately to the north of the main North Group complex on the western half of Terrace 7 for {{convert|200|m|ft}}, at the eastern extreme of this section it turns north above Terrace 8 for {{convert|300|m|ft}} before changing to run another {{convert|200|m|ft}} east, limiting Terrace 8 on its west and north sides. Terrace 9 supports only two major structures (Structures 66 and 67). A modern road cuts the eastern side of the Terrace 9, excavations where the road has cut the terrace have revealed the possible remains of a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1007-8.

[[Image:TakalikAbajBallcourtp2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Middle Classic ballcourt on Terrace 2 in the Central Group.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 1994, pp.73-4.</ref>]]

===Structures===
*The '''Ballcourt''' is located in the southwest of Terrace 2 and dates to the Middle Preclassic. It has a north-south alignment with the sides of the {{convert|4.6|m|ft|adj=on}} wide playing area being formed by '''Structures Sub-2''' and '''Sub-4'''. The ballcourt is just over {{convert|22|m|ft}} long with a playing area of {{convert|105|m2|ft2}}. The southern limit of the ballcourt is formed by '''Structure Sub-1''', just over {{convert|11|m|ft}} to the south of Structures Sub-2 and Sub-4, creating a southern end-zone that runs east-west and measures {{convert|23|by|11|m|ft}} with a surface area of {{convert|264|m2|ft2}}.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 1994, pp.73-4.</ref>

*'''Structure 7''' is a large platform located to the east of the plaza on Terrace 3 in the Central Group and is considered to be one of the most sacred buildings at Takalik Abaj due to a series of important finds associated with it. Structure 7 measures {{convert|79|by|112|m|ft}} and dates to the Middle Preclassic. Built upon the northern part of Structure 7 are two smaller structures, designated as Structures 7A and 7B.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784. Schieber de Lavarreda 2002, p.399.</ref> Structure 7 supports three rows of monuments aligned north-south that may have served as an astronomica,l observatory.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch 2002, pp.378-80.</ref> Another important find in Structure 7 was a Late Classic cylindrical incensario given the name "La Ni<U+00F1>a" by archaeologists due to its prominent female [[appliqu<U+00E9>]] figure. It dates to the earliest levels of K'iche' occupation of the site and is {{convert|50|cm|in}} high and {{convert|30|cm|in}} wide at the base. It was found together with a large quantity of other offerings including further ceramics and fragments of broken sculptures.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2005, pp.724-5. Popenoe de Hatch 2005, p.997.</ref>

*'''Structure 7A''' is a small structure sitting on top of the northern part of Structure 7. It dates to the Middle Preclassic and has been excavated. The Late Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial 1 was found in its centre. A large offering of hundreds of ceramic vessels was found in the base of the structure and is associated with the burial. Structure 7A underwent substantial rebuilding in the Early Classic and was again modified in the Late Classic.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, pp.784, 787-8.</ref>

*'''Structure 11''' has been excavated. It was covered with rounded boulders held together with clay.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> It is located to the west of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.212.</ref>
[[Image:TakalikAbajView.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Structure 11 and its associated monuments.]]

*'''Structure 12''' lies to the east of Structure 11.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.214.</ref> It has also been excavated and, like Sturcture 11, it is covered with rounded boulders held together with clay.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.210.</ref> It lies to the east of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.212.</ref> The structure is a three-tiered platfrom with stairways on the east and west sides. The visible remains date to the Early Classic but they overlie Late Preclassic construction. A row of sculptures lines the west side of the structure, including six monuments, a stela and an altar.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.212.</ref> Further monuments line the east side, one of which may be the head of a crocodilian, the others are plain. Sculpture 69 is located on the south side of the structure.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.214.</ref>

*'''Structure 17''' is located in the South Group, on the Santa Margarita plantation. It contained a Late Preclassic cache of 13 prismatic obsidian blades.<ref>Crasborn 2005, pp.695, 698.</ref>

*'''Structure 34''' is in the West Group, at the eastern corner of Terrace 6.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1010.</ref>

*'''Structures 38''', '''39''', '''42''' and '''43''' are joined by low platforms on the east side of a plaza on Terrace 7, aligned north-south. '''Structures 40''', '''47''' and '''48''' are on south, west and north sides of this plaza. '''Structures 49''', '''50''', '''51''', '''52''' and '''53''' form a small group on the west side of the terrace, bordered on the north by Terrace 9. Structure 42 is the tallest structure in the North Group, measuring about {{convert|11.5|m|ft}} high.<ref>Jacobo 1999, p.550. Schieber de Lavarreda & P<U+00E9>rez 2004, p.410.</ref>

*'''Structure 46''' is at the edge of Terrace 8 in the North Group and dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic. The west side of the structure has been cut by a modern road.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref>

*'''Structure 54''' is built upon Terrace 8, to the north of Structure 46, in the North Group. It is surrounded by an open area without mounds that was probably a mixed residential and agricultural area. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1007.</ref>

*'''Structure 57''' is a large mound at the southern limit of the Central Group with an excellent view across the coastal plain. The structure was built in the Late Preclassic and underwent a second phase of construction in the Late Classic. It may have served as a look-out point.<ref>Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.993</ref>
[[Image:Structure5.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Structure 5.]]

*'''Structure 61''', '''Mound 61A''' and '''Mound 61B''' are all on the east side of Terrace 5, on the San Isidro plantation. Structure 61 was built during the Early Classic and is dressed with stone, it was built upon an earlier construction dating to the Late Preclassic. Stela 68 was found at the base of Mound 61A near to a broken altar. Structure 61 and its associated mounds may have been used to control access to the city during the height of its power, Mound 61A was reused during the Postclassic occupation of the site. Early Classic finds from Mound 61A include four ceramic vessels and four obsidian prismatic blades.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, pp.1008-9. Crasborn 2005, p.698.</ref>

*'''Structure 66''' is located on Terrace 9, at the northern extreme of the North Group. It has an excellent view across the entire city and may have served as a sentry post controlling access to the site. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1008.</ref>

*'''Structure 67''' is a large platform on Terrace 9 that may have been associated with a possible residential area upon that terrace and located to the north of the North Group.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1008.</ref>

*'''Structure 68''' is in the West Group. A part of the western side of the structure has been cut by a modern road.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1010.</ref>

*'''North Ballcourt'''. The possible remains of a second ballcourt were found to the north of the North Group and may have been associated with the occupation of that group from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic. It was built from compacted clay and runs east-west, the North Structure was {{convert|2|m|ft}} tall and the South Structure had a height of {{convert|1|m|ft}}, the playing area was {{convert|10|m|ft}} wide.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1008.</ref>

[[Image:Potbelly 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A potbelly sculpture at Takalik Abaj, probably dating to the Late Preclassic.]]

===Stone monuments===
More than 239 stone monuments have been found at Takalik Abaj, mostly carved from local [[andesite]] boulders.<ref>Wolley 2002, p.365. Benson 1996, p.23.</ref> These monuments are both plain and carved and are mostly found in the Central and Western Groups.<ref>Benson 1996, p.23. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.786.</ref> The worked monuments can be divided into four broad classifications: Olmec-style sculptures which represent 21% of the total, Maya-style sculptures representing 42% of the monuments, potbelly monuments (14% of the total) and the local style of sculpture represented by zoomorphs (23% of the total).<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.786.</ref>

Most of the monuments at Takalik Abaj are not in their original positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.467.</ref>  An example is a series of four monuments found in a plaza in front of a Classic period platform, with at least two of the four (Altar 12 and Monument 23) dating to the Preclassic.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref>

There are several stelae sculpted in the early Maya style that bear hieroglyphic texts with [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] dates that place them in the Late Preclassic.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.467.</ref> This style of sculpture is ancestral to the Classic style of the Maya lowlands.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.468.</ref>

Takalik Abaj has various so-called Potbelly monuments representing obese human figures sculpted from large boulders, of a type found throughout the Pacific lowlands, extending from Izapa in Mexico to [[El Salvador]]. Their precise function is unknown but they appear to date from the Late Preclassic.<ref>Sharer 2000, pp.476-7. Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.30.</ref>

====Olmec style sculptures====
The many Olmec-style sculptures, including Monument 23, a colossal head that was recarved into a niche figure,<ref>Graham 1989, p.232.</ref> seem to indicate a physical Olmec presence and control, possibly under an Olmec governor.<ref>Adams 1996, pp.73, 81.</ref> Archaeologist John Graham states that:

{{blockquote|Olmec sculpture at Abaj Takalik such as Monument 23 clearly reflects the presence of Olmec sculptors who are working for Olmec patrons and creating Olmec art with Olmec content in the context of Olmec ritual.<ref>Graham 1989, p.235.</ref>}}

[[Image:Takalik Abaj Olmec sculpture 1.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Monument 23, an Olmec (or Olmec-influenced) sculpture at Takalik Abaj, showing a figure emerging from a cave, bearing an infant in its arms. Compare with [[La Venta#Altars 4 & 5|Altar 5 at La Venta]]]]
Others are less sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common iconography of power on the Pacific and Gulf coasts.<ref>Adams 1996, p.81.</ref> In any case, Takalik Abaj was certainly a place of importance for Olmecs.<ref>Diehl 2004, p.147. Graham has said that Takalik Abaj is the "most important Olmec site" known within Pacific Guatemala. (Graham 1989, p.231.)</ref> The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Middle Preclassic.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.786.</ref> Except for Monuments 1 and 64, the majority were not found in their original locations.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.786.</ref>

====Maya style sculptures====
There are more than 30 monuments in the early Maya style, which dates to the Late Preclassic, making it the most common style represented at Takalik Abaj.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref> The great quantity of early Maya sculpture and the presence of early examples of Maya hieroglyphic writing suggest that the site played an important part in the development of Maya ideology.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref> The early Maya style of monument at Takalik Abaj is closely linked to the style of monument at Kaminaljuyu, showing mutual influence. This interlinked style spread to other sites that formed part of the extended trade network of which these two cities were the twin foci.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.788.</ref>

====Potbelly style sculptures====
Sculptures of the Potbelly style are found all along the Pacific Coast from southern Mexico to El Salvador, as well as further afield at sites in the Maya lowlands.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.791-2. Sharer 2000, pp.476-7.</ref> Although some investigators have suggested that this style is pre-Olmec, archaeological excavations on the Pacific Coast, including those at Takalik Abaj, have shown that this style began to be used at the end of the Middle Preclassic and reached its height during the Late Preclassic.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.791-2.</ref> The potbelly sculptures at Takalik Abaj all date to the Late Preclassic and are very similar to those at [[Monte Alto culture|Monte Alto]] in Escuintla and Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.791-2.</ref>
Potbelly sculptures are generally rough sculptures that show considerable variation in size and the position of the limbs.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.791-2.</ref> They depict obese human figures, usually sat cross-legged with their arms upon their stomach. They have puffed out or hanging cheeks, closed eyes and are of indeterminate gender.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.791-2.</ref>

====Local style sculptures====
Local style sculptures are generally boulders carved into zoomorphic shapes, including three-dimensional representations of frogs, toads and crocodilians.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.786, 792.</ref>

====Inventory of monuments====
[[Image:TakalikAbajAltar28.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Altar 28, bearing the carving of a skull.<ref>Wolley 2002, p.368.</ref>]]
=====Altars=====
*'''Altar 1''' is found at the base of Stela 1, it is rectangular in shape with a carving on its side.<ref>Chang Lam 1991, p.19.</ref>

*'''Altar 2''' is of unknown provenance, having been moved to outside the administrator's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is {{convert|1.59|m|in}} long, about {{convert|0.9|m|in}} wide and about {{convert|0.5|m|in}} high. It represents an animal variously identified as a toad and a jaguar. The body of the animal was sculptured to form a hollow {{convert|85|cm|in}} across and {{convert|26|cm|in}} deep. The sculpture was broken into three pieces.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.33, 44.</ref>

*'''Altar 3''' is a roughly worked flat, circular altar about {{convert|1|m|in}} across and {{convert|0.3|m|in}} high. It was probably associated originally with a stela but its original location is unknown, it was moved near to the manager's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.37.</ref>

*'''Altar 5''' is a damaged plain circular altar associated with Stela 2.<ref>Chang Lam 1991, p.19.</ref>

*'''Altar 8''' is a plain monument associated with Stela 5, positioned on the west side of Structure 12.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.212-3.</ref>

*'''Altar 9''' is a low four-legged throne placed in front of Structure 11.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, p.173.</ref>

*'''Altar 10''' was associated with Stela 13 and was found on top of the large offering of ceramics associated with that stela and the royal tomb in Structure 7A. The monument was orginally a throne with cylindrical supports that was reused as an altar in the Classic period.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2002, p.399-402. Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.791.</ref>

*'''Altar 12''' is a Late Preclassic monument carved in the early Maya style.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> Because of the carvings on the upper face of the altar, it is supposed that the monument was originally erected as a vertical stela in the Late Preclassic, and was reused as a horizontal altar in the Classic. At this time sixteen hieroglyphs were carved around the outer rim of the altar. The carving on the upper face of the altar represents a standing human figure portrayed in profile, facing left. The figure is flanked by two vertical series of four glyphs. A smaller profile figure is depicted facing the first figure, separated from it by one of the series of glyphs. The central figure is depicted standing upon a horizontal band representing the earth, the band is flanked by two earth monsters. Above the figure is a celestial band with part of the head of a sacred bird visible in the centre. The sixteen glyphs on the rim of the monument are formed by anthropomorphic figures mixed with other elements.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.789-90, 800.</ref>
[[Image:Monument67TakalikAbaj.jpg|thumb||200px|Monument 67, an Olmec style sculpture dating to the Middle Preclassic.]]

*'''Altar 13''' is another early Maya monument dating to the Late Preclassic. Like Altar 12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was delibrately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.790, 802.</ref>

*'''Altar 28''' is located near Structure 10 in the Central Group. It is a circular basalt altar just over {{convert|2|m|in}} in diameter and {{convert|0.5|m|in}} thick. On the front rim of the altar is a carving of a skull. On the upper surface are two relief carvings of human feet.<ref>Wolley 2002, p.368.</ref>

*'''Altar 30''' is embedded in the fourth step of the access stairway to Terrace 3 in the Central Group. It has four low legs supporting it and is similar to Altar 9.<ref>Garc<U+00ED>a 1997, pp.173, 187.</ref>

=====Monuments=====
*'''Monument 1''' is a volcanic boulder with the [[Relief|bas-relief]] sculpture of a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|ballplayer]], probably representing a local ruler. This figure is facing to the right, kneeling on one knee with both hands raised. The sculpture was found near the riverbank at a crossing point of the river Ixchay<U+00E1>, some {{convert|300|m|ft}} to the west of the Central Group. It measures about {{convert|1.5|m|in}} in height. Monument 1 dates to the Middle Preclassic and is distinctively Olmec in style.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.191-2. Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.29-30, 38. Popenoe de Hatch & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.991. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.787. Wolley 2002, p.366.</ref>

*'''Monument 2''' is a potbelly sculpture found {{convert|12|m|ft}} from the road running between the San Isidro and Buenos Aires plantations. It is about {{convert|1.4|m|in}} high and {{convert|0.75|m|in}} in diameter. The head is badly eroded and inclined slightly forwards, its arms are slightly bent with the hands doubled downwards and the fingers marked. Monument 2 dates to the Late Preclassic.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.30. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.791-2.</ref>

*'''Monument 3''' also dates to the Late Preclassic. It was relocated in modern times to the coffee-drying area of the Santa Margarita plantation. It is not known where it was originally found. It is a potbelly figure with a large head, it wears a necklace or pendant that hangs to its chest. It is about {{convert|0.96|m|in}} high and {{convert|0.78|m|in}} wide at the shoulders. The monument is damaged and missing the lower part.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.30-1. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.791-2.</ref>

*'''Monument 4''' appears to be a sculpture of a captive, leaning slightly forward and with the hands tied behind its back. It was found on the lands of the San Isidro plantation but it is not known exactly where. It was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog<U+00ED>a y Etnolog<U+00ED>a in Guatemala City. This monument probably dates to the Late Preclassic. It is {{convert|0.87|m|in}} high and about {{convert|0.4|m|in}} wide.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.31-2, 43.</ref>

[[Image:TakalikAbajMonument.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Monument 68, representing a toad.<ref>Kelly 1996, pp.213-4.</ref>]]
*'''Monument 5''' was moved to the administrator's house of the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation, the place where it was originally found is unknown. It measures {{convert|1.53|m|in}} in height and is {{convert|0.53|m|in}} wide at the widest point. It is another sculpture of a captive with the arms bound with a strip of cloth that falls across the hips.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.32.</ref>

*'''Monument 6''' is a zoomorph sulpture discovered during the construction of the road that passes the site. It was moved to the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog<U+00ED>a y Etnolog<U+00ED>a in Guatemala City. The sculpture is just over {{convert|1|m|in}} in height and is {{convert|1.5|m|in}} wide. It is a boulder carved into the form of an animal head, probably that of a toad, and is likely to date to the Late Preclassic.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.32-3, 39.</ref>

*'''Monument 7''' is a damaged sculpture in the form of a giant head. It stands {{convert|0.58|m|in}} and was found in the first half of the 20th century on the site of the electricity generator of the Santa Margarita plantation and moved close to the administration office. The sculpture has a large, flat face with prominent eyebrows. Its style is very similar to that of a monument found at [[Kaminaljuyu]] in the highlands.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.36-7, 41, 45.</ref>

*'''Monument 8''' is found on the west side of Structure 12. It is a zoomorphic sculpture of a monster with feline characteristics disgorging a small anthropomorphic figure from its mouth.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.214.</ref>

*'''Monument 9''' is a local style sculpture representing an owl.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.792.</ref>

*'''Monument 10''' is another monument that was moved from its original location; it was moved to the estate of the Santa Margarita plantation and the place where it was originally found is unknown. It is about {{convert|0.5|m|in}} high and {{convert|0.4|m|in}} wide. This is a damage sculpture representing a kneeling captive with the arms tied.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.32.</ref>

[[Image:TakalikAbajMonument65.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monument 65, an Olmec-style sculpture of a human head dating to the Middle Preclassic period.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.787, 797.</ref>]]
*'''Monument 11''' is located in the southwestern area of Terrace 3. It is a natural boulder carved with a vertical series of five hieroglyphs. Further left is a single hieroglyph and the glyphs for the number 11. This sculpture of early Maya style and dates to the Late Preclassic.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.214. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.788-9, 800.</ref>

*'''Monument 14''' is an eroded Olmec-style sculpture dating to the Middle Preclassic. It represents a squatting human figure, possibly female, wearing a headdress and ear-spools. Under one arm it grips a [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures|jaguar]] cub, under the other it carries a fawn.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.786-8, 798.</ref>

*'''Monument 15''' is a large boulder with an Olmec-style relief sculpture of the head, shoulders and arms of an anthropomorphic figure emerging from a shallow niche, the arms being bent inwards at the elbow. The back of the boulder is carved with the hindquarters of a feline, probably a jaguar.<ref>Graham 1992, pp.328-9.</ref>

[[Image:Stela18TakalikAbaj.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stela 18 and its associated altar.]]

=====Stelae=====
*'''Stela 1''' was found near to Stela 2 and moved near to the administrator's house of the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is {{convert|1.36|m|in}} high, {{convert|0.72|m|in}} wide and {{convert|0.45|m|in}} thick. It bears the sculpture of a standing figure facing to the left, bearing a sceptre in the form of a serpent with a dragon mask at the lower end, a feline is on top of the serpent's body. It is similar in style to Stela 1 at [[El Ba<U+00FA>l]]. A badly eroded hieroglyphic text is to the left of the figure's face, it is now completely illegible. This stela is early Maya in style, dating it to the Late Preclassic.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, p.34. Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.791, 805.</ref>

*'''Stela 2''' is a monument in the early Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the first century BC.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.467.</ref> Flanking the text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.248.</ref> Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile looking down at the left-hand figure below.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.790, 803.</ref> Stela 2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace 5.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1008.</ref>

*'''Stela 3''' is badly damaged, being broken into three pieces. It was found somewhere on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation although its exact original location is not known. It was moved to a museum in Guatemala City. The lower portion of the stela depicts two legs facing to the left standing upon a horizontal band divided into three sections, each section containing a symbol or glyph.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.35, 42.</ref>

*'''Stela 4''' was uncovered in 1969 and moved near to the administrator's house on the San Isidro Piedra Parada plantation. It is of a style very similar to the stelae at Izapa and stands {{convert|1.37|m|in}} high.<ref>Cassier & Ichon 1981, pp.36, 41.</ref> The stela bears a complex design representing an undulating vision serpent rising toward the sky from the water flowing from two earth monsters, the jaws of the serpent are open wide towards the sky and from them emerges a characteristically Maya face. Several glyphs appear among the imagery. This stela is early Maya in style and dates to the Late Preclassic.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.788-9, 799.</ref>

[[Image:Takalik Abaj Stela 5 p4.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Stela 5 and Altar 8.]]
*'''Stela 5''' is reasonably well preserved and is inscribed with two Long Count dates flanked by representations of two standing figures portraying rulers. The latest of these two dates is from AD 126.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.468.</ref> The right-hand figure is holding a snake, while the left-hand figure is holding what is probably a jaguar.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, p.790.</ref> This monument probably represents one ruler passing power to the next.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.248.</ref> A small seated figure is carved onto each of the sides of this stela with a badly eroded heiroglyphic inscription. The style is early Maya and has affinities with sculptures at [[Izapa]].<ref>Kelly 1996, p.213.</ref>

*'''Stela 12''' is located near Structure 11. It is badly damaged, having been broken into fragments, of which two remain. The largest fragment is from the lower portion of the stela and depicts the legs and feet of a figure, both facing in the same direction. They stand upon a panel divided into geometric sections, each containing a further design. In front of the legs are the remains of a glyph that appears to be a number in the [[Maya numerals|bar-and-dot]] format. A smaller fragment lies nearby.<ref>Kelly 1996, p.214.</ref>

*'''Stela 13''' dates to the Late Preclassic. It is badly damaged, having been broken in two parts. It is carved in early Maya style and bears a design representing a stylised serpentine head, very similar to a monument found at Kaminaljuyu.<ref>Orrego Corzo & Schieber de Lavarreda 2001, pp.788-9, 799.</ref> Stela 13 was erected at the base of the south side of Structure 7A. At the base of the stela was found a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels, 33 prismatic obsidian blades, as well as other artifacts. The stela and the offering are associated with the Late Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial 1.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784. Crasborn 2005, p.697.</ref>

*'''Stela 14''' is on the eastern edge of Terrace 3, in the Central Group. It is fashioned from andesite and has 27 cup-like depressions upon the surface. It is one of the few such monuments found within the ceremonial centre of the city.<ref>Wolley 2002, p.373.</ref>

*'''Stela 29''' is a smooth andesite monument at the southeast corner of Structure 11 with seven steps carved into its upper portion.<ref>Wolley 2002, p.373.</ref>

*'''Stela 66''' is a plain stela dating to the Late Preclassic. It is found in the West Group, on Terrace 6.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1010.</ref>

*'''Stela 68''' was found at the southeast corner of Mound 61A on Terrace 5. This stela was broken in two and the remaining fragments appear to belong to two separate monuments. The stela, or stelae, once bore early Maya sculpture but this appears to have been deliberately destroyed, leaving only a few sculptured symbols.<ref>Wolley Schwarz 2001, p.1009.</ref>

*'''Stela 71''' is an early Maya carved fragment reused in the construction of a water channel by Structure 7.<ref>Marroqu<U+00ED>n 2005, pp.957-8.</ref>

===Royal burial===
A Late Preclassic tomb has been excavated, believed to be a royal burial.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.239.</ref> This tomb has been designated '''Burial 1'''; it was found during excavations of Structure 7A and was inserted into the centre of this Middle Preclassic structure.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784.</ref> The burial is also associated with Stela 13 and with a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels and other artifacts found at the base of Structure 7A. These ceramics date the offering to the end of the Late Preclassic.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784.</ref> No human remains have been recovered but the find is assumed to be a burial due to the associated artifacts.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.788.</ref> The body is believed to have been interred upon a litter measuring {{convert|1|m|in}} by {{convert|2|m|in}}, which was probably made of wood and coated in red [[cinnabar]] dust.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.788.</ref> Grave goods include an 18-piece [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] necklace, two earspools coated in cinnabar, various mosaic mirrors made from [[iron pyrite]], one consisting of more than 800 pieces, a jade mosaic mask, two prismatic obsidian blades, a finely carved [[Greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]] fish, various beads that presumably formed jewellery such as bracelets and a selection of ceramics that date the tomb to AD 100&ndash;200.<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, pp.790-1.</ref>
