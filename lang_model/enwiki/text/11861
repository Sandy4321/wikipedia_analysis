'''''Innocent Blood''''' is a [[1992 in film|1992]] [[horror film|horror]]-[[crime film]] directed by [[John Landis]].  The film stars [[Anne Parillaud]] as a vampire who finds herself against a blood-sucking legion of mobsters after biting a notorious crime boss played by [[Robert Loggia]].

The film is set and was filmed in and around the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] area. The "Little Italy" of Pittsburgh, a portion of the [[Bloomfield (Pittsburgh)|Bloomfield, Pittsburgh]] neighborhood, clustered around Liberty Avenue, is recognizable in many of the film's outdoor urban scenes. Actors [[Tony Sirico]] and [[David Proval]] have supporting parts as gangsters, foreshadowing their roles in ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

==Plot==
[[Anne Parillaud]] plays Marie, a very appealing modern-day [[vampire]] in Pittsburgh, with a moral code that limits her bloodsucking to the criminal elements of society. However, when she feasts on vicious gang boss Salvatore 'The Shark' Macelli ([[Robert Loggia]]) and fails to complete the job properly (by not severing his spinal cord), he, too, becomes one of the undead and begins to pass his new-found powers on to his henchmen. With the help (and eventual love interest) of undercover cop Joseph Gennaro ([[Anthony LaPaglia]]), Marie sets out to put things right. This movie balances plenty of slickly directed thrills and gore with some moments of humour. Loggia's bewilderment at waking in the morgue to find a thermometer protruding from his stomach and the reaction of the wife of crooked lawyer Manny Bergman ([[Don Rickles]]) to the bizarre mayhem that ensues are good examples.

==Cast==
*[[Anne Parillaud]] - '''Marie''', a lonely modern-day vampire who lives for food and sex, but her feeding is only limited to criminals, because she never, ever takes innocent blood. She has not had anything for six nights. She then decides to feed off the Italian mob syndicate, led by Sal "The Shark" Macelli.

*[[Robert Loggia]] - '''Salvatore "Sal the Shark" Macelli''', the head (or "boss") of his [[Mafia]] [[crime syndicate]] and the Pittsburgh [[underworld]], and pariah to the police and feds. Marie, at his place, feeds on him, but by Sal shooting her in the chest, fails to finish him off. Macelli becomes now a bloodsucker hell bent on turning his [[henchman|henchmen]] into one of his "new children".

*[[Anthony LaPaglia]] - '''Detective Joseph Gennaro''', an undercover cop who aides Marie; also a love interest for Marie. 

*[[Don Rickles]] - '''Emmaunel 'Manny' Bergman''', a crooked attorney who keeps Macelli out of trouble.  He comes to a memorable special effects end after Macelli has bitten him; and not quite dead he "wakes up" in a hospital and they open the curtains and let sunshine in. Lawyer/Vampire, Rickles makes the combination perfect.
