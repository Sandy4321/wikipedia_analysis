[[File:Am linlithgow palace north west.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Linlithgow Palace]], the first building to bear that title in Scotland, was extensively rebuilt along Renaissance principles from the fifteenth century.]]
The '''architecture of Scotland in the Middle Ages''' includes all building within the modern borders of Scotland, between the departure of the Romans from Northern Britain in the early fifth century and the adoption of the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]] in the early sixteenth century, and includes vernacular, ecclesiastical, royal, aristocratic and military constructions. The first surviving houses in Scotland go back 9500 years. There is evidence of different forms of stone and wooden houses exist and earthwork [[hill forts]] from the [[Iron Age]]. The arrival of the Romans from about led to the abandonment of many of these forts. After the departure of the Romans in the fifth century, there evidence their reoccupation and of the building of a series of smaller "nucleated" constructions sometimes utilising major geographical features, as at [[Dunadd]] and [[Dumbarton Castle|Dumbarton]]. In the following centuries new forms of construction emerged throughout Scotland that would come to define the landscape.

Medieval [[vernacular architecture]] utilised local building materials, including [[cruck]] constructed houses, [[sod|turf]] walls and clay, with a heavy reliance on stone. Medieval parish church architecture was typically simpler than in England, but there were grander ecclesiastical buildings in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styles. From the early fifteenth century, the introduction of Renaissance styles included the selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture, as in the nave of [[Dunkeld Cathedral]]. Castles arrived in Scotland with the introduction of [[feudalism]] in the twelfth century. Initially these were wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] constructions, but many were replaced by stone castles with a high curtain wall. In the late Middle Ages, new castles were built, some on a grander scale, and others, particularly in the borders, as simpler [[tower house]]s. Gunpowder weaponry led to the use of gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls adapted to resist bombardment. There was a phase of Renaissance palace building from the late fifteenth century, beginning at [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]].

==Vernacular buildings==
{{Main|Housing in Scotland}}
[[File:Morlanich Longhouse 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Moirlanich Longhouse]] is a [[blackhouse (building)|blackhouse]] built in the nineteenth century in the traditional manner with a cruck frame.]]
Medieval [[vernacular architecture]] in rural environments made use of local materials and styles. As in England, [[cruck]] construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of [[sod|turf]] to fill in the walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around [[Dundee]], solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, [[Turf roof|turf]] and [[straw]], rendered with clay or [[Lime (material)|lime]] to make them weatherproof.<ref>R. W. Brunskill, ''Houses and Cottages of Britain'' (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), ISBN 0575071222, pp. 235<U+2013>40.</ref> With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used [[Broom (shrub)|broom]], [[Ericaceae|heather]], straw, turfs or [[reed]]s for roofing.<ref name=McKean2010pp55-6>C. McKean, "Improvement and modernisation in everyday Enlightenment Scotland", in E. A. Foyster and C. A. Whatley, ed., ''A History of Everyday Life in Scotland, 1600 to 1800'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), ISBN 0-7486-1965-8, pp.&nbsp;55<U+2013>6.</ref> 

From the twelfth century, [[burgh]]s, towns that were granted certain legal privileges from [[the Crown]], developed, particularly on the east coast with distinctive urban building patterns. They were typically surrounded by a [[palisade]], and many had a castle. They usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a [[mercat cross]]. There were houses for the nobles, [[burgess (title)|burgesses]] and other significant inhabitants,<ref name=MacQuarrie2004pp136-40>A. MacQuarrie, ''Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation'' (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), ISBN 0-7509-2977-4, pp. 136<U+2013>40.</ref> which were often built in a relatively elaborate style and by the end of the period some would had slate roofs or tiles.<ref>J. Hunter, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9CPK__7S3zkC&pg=PT48&dq=medieval+burgh+merchants+houses&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_g3yT8eUCI2u8QOhxYSJDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=medieval%20burgh%20merchants%20houses&f=false ''Last of the Free: A History of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland''] (London: Random House, 2011), ISBN 1780570066.</ref> Very little has survived of the houses of the urban poor. They were probably largely located in the backlands, away from the main street frontages. From [[Aberdeen]] and [[Perth (Scotland)|Perth]] there is evidence of nearly forty buildings dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, with walls of planks or [[Wattle (construction)|wattles]].<ref>D. M. Palliser, P. Clark, M. Martin and J. Daunton, ''The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, Volume 1'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0521801559, p. 386.</ref>

==Churches==
{{Main|Church architecture in Scotland}}
The introduction of Christianity into Scotland from Ireland from the sixth century led to the construction of basic masonry-built churches, beginning on the west coast and islands.<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3>I. Maxwell, ''A History of Scotland's Masonry Construction'' in P. Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), ISBN 1-904320-02-3, pp. 22<U+2013>3.</ref> Medieval parish church architecture in Scotland was typically much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without [[transept]]s and [[aisle]]s, and often without towers. In the [[Highlands of Scotland|Highlands]] they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.<ref name=Whyte&Whyte1991p117>I. D. Whyte, K. A. Whyte, ''The Changing Scottish landscape, 1500<U+2013>1800'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), ISBN 0-415-02992-9, p. 117.</ref> However, from the eighth century, more sophisticated buildings emerged. Early [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[ashlar]] masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century [[Irish round tower|round tower]] at [[Brechin Cathedral]] and the square towers of [[Dunblane Cathedral]] and [[St Andrews Cathedral|The Church of St Rule]].<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3/>

[[File:Glasgow-cathedral-may-2007.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Gothic front of [[Glasgow Cathedral]]]]
After the eleventh century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in structurally more stable walls that could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in [[corbel]]ling, [[buttress]]ing, [[lintel]]s and [[arch]]ing. At the same time there were increasing influences from English and continental European designs. These can be seen in the Romanesque chevron pattern on the piers in the nave of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] (1130<U+2013>40), which were modelled on details from [[Durham Cathedral]].<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3/> [[St Magnus Cathedral]] in Orkney, begun in 1137, may have employed masons that had worked at Durham.<ref name="West1985pp12-14">T. W. West, ''Discovering Scottish Architecture'' (Botley: Osprey, 1985), ISBN 0-85263-748-9, pp. 12<U+2013>14.</ref> The arrival of the [[Cluniac Reforms|new monastic orders]] in Scotland from the twelfth century led to a boom in ecclesiastical building using English and continental forms, including abbeys at [[Kelso Abbey|Kelso]], [[Holyrood Abbey|Holyrood]], [[Jedburgh Abbey|Jedburgh]] and [[St Andrews Cathedral Priory|St Andrews]].<ref name="West1985pp12-14"/>

In the thirteenth century, the east end of [[Elgin Cathedral]] incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery.<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3/> In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and the rebuilding of [[Melrose Abbey]], both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture.<ref name="Wormald1991pp57-9">J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470<U+2013>1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp.&nbsp;57<U+2013>9.</ref> The interiors of churches were often elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.<ref name=Whyte&Whyte1991p117/> The carvings at [[Rosslyn Chapel]], created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the [[seven deadly sins]], are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style.<ref>S. H. Rigby, ''A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages'' (London: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), ISBN 0-631-21785-1, p. 532.</ref> Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]].<ref name=Whyte&Whyte1991p117/>

The impact of the [[Renaissance]] on ecclesiastical architecture can be seen in the re-adoption of low-massive church building with round arches and pillars, in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly [[English Gothic architecture|dominant in England]] in the late Medieval era. It may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands, and was perhaps a conscious reaction against English forms in favour of continental ones. It can be seen in the nave of [[Dunkeld Cathedral]], begun in 1406, the facade of [[St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington|St Mary's, Haddington]] from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's [[Kings College, Aberdeen]] (1500<U+2013>09).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996pp3-4>M.

[[File:Dunstaffnage Castle 20080428.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dunstaffnage Castle]] is one of the oldest surviving "castles of enceinte", mostly dating from the thirteenth century.]]
Scotland is known for its dramatically placed castles, many of which date from the late medieval era. Castles, in the sense of a fortified residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of [[David I of Scotland|David I]]'s encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands.<ref name=Simpson&Webster2003p225>G.

J. Tabraham, ''Scotland's Castles'' (London: Batsford, 2005), ISBN 978-0-7134-8943-9, p. 16.</ref> In England many of these constructions were converted into stone "[[keep|keep-and-bailey]]" castles in the twelfth century, but in Scotland most of those that were in continued occupation became stone castles of "[[enceinte]]" from the thirteenth century, with a high [[battlements|embattled]] curtain wall.<ref name="West1985p26"/> The need for thick and high walls for defence forced the use of economic building methods, often continuing the tradition of dry-stone rubble building, which were then covered with a lime render, or [[harl]]ed for weatherproofing and a uniform appearance.<ref>I. Maxwell, ''A History of Scotland's Masonry Construction'' in P. Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), ISBN 1-904320-02-3, p. 24.</ref> In addition to the baronial castles there were royal castles, often larger and providing defence, lodging for the itinerant Scottish court and a local administrative centre. By 1200 these included fortifications at [[Ayr Castle|Ayr]] and [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]].<ref>C. J. Tabraham, ''Scotland's Castles'' (London: Batsford, 2005), ISBN 978-0-7134-8943-9, p. 12.</ref> 

In the [[wars of Scottish Independence]], [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]] adopted a policy of castle destruction, rather than allow fortresses to be easily retaken and then held by the English, beginning with his own castles at Ayr and [[Dumfries]],<ref>J. S. Hamilton, ''The Plantagenets: History of a Dynasty'' (London: Continuum, 2010), ISBN 1-4411-5712-3, p. 116.</ref> and including [[Roxburgh Castle|Roxburgh]] and [[Edinburgh Castle|Edinburgh]].<ref>D. Cornell, ''Bannockburn: the Triumph of Robert the Bruce'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009), ISBN 0-300-14568-3, p. 124.</ref> After the Wars of Independence, new castles began to be built, often on a grander scale as "[[livery and maintenance]]" castles, to house retained troops, like [[Tantallon Castle|Tantallon]], Lothian and [[Doune Castle|Doune]] near Stirling, rebuilt for [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]] in the fourteenth century.<ref name="West1985p26"/> [[Gunpowder]] weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture, with existing castles being adapted to allow the use of gunpowder weapons by the incorporation of "keyhole" gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls being adapted to resist bombardment. [[Ravenscraig Castle|Ravenscraig]], Kirkcaldy, begun about 1460, is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an [[artillery]] fort, incorporating "D-shape" bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted.<ref name=West1985p27>T.

==Palaces==
{{See also|Renaissance in Scotland}}
The extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces in the Renaissance style probably began under [[James III of Scotland|James III]] and accelerated under James IV. These works have been seen as directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]] was first constructed under [[James I of Scotland|James I]], under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun, and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace of a ''palatium ad modem castri'' (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed, and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p9>M.
