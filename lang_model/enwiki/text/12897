The church was built during the early 13th century; [[dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] evidence point to that the roof was laid in about 1213.<ref name="DMU"/> It remains a largely unaltered [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building. It belongs to the "first generation" of church building in Sweden.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/> A [[church porch]] was added during the 15th century, and during the same time the ceiling was [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]].<ref name="DMU"/> The external [[bell tower]] was built in wood in 1727. The windows of the church were also enlarged during the 18th century, and a round window in the [[apse]] inserted during the early 19th century. The tin roof is similarly from the 19th century.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/>

Externally, the church retains much of its Romanesque appearance. Although plastered in yellow colour today, originally the roughly hewn stone of which the church was built were exposed.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/> The original church door still remains. It dates from the 12th century and so is older than the church itself. Made of oak, it is decorated with metal hoops in different forms and shapes.<ref name="DMU"/> The exterior of the church gives a good idea of what early Romanesque churches in the [[Nordic countries]] often look like.<ref name="f<U+00F6>rsamling"/> It is also one of few early medieval churches in Uppland which has retained its original floor plan.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/>

Inside, the church is [[whitewash|whitewashed]] except for the the church porch, where fragments of medieval [[fresco]]s have been found and are now again displayed.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/> Of the church furnishings, only the [[triumphal cross]] is medieval.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/> It is of a type more commonly found on [[Gotland]] than in Uppland, and dates from the second half of the 13th century.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/> The [[altar]] and [[pulpit]], dominating the [[apse]], are a work by the carpenter Magnus Granlund (1711-1779) from [[Stockholm]], and [[Rococo]] in style. Granlund worked on several churches in Uppland.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/> The [[organ (music)|organ]] facade is from the 1820s and in a provincial [[Empire style]], while the organ itself was replaced in 1985.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/> The [[baptismal font]] is a modern work, presented to the church in 1972.<ref name="f<U+00F6>rsamling"/>

The church has never had a tower but instead an external belfry. The presently visible bellfry replaced an earlier of unknown age.<ref name="f<U+00F6>rsamling"/> It carries two [[church bell]]s, one medieval and one made in 1727.<ref name="kyrkanbroschyr"/>
