The '''Battle of Corunna''' (or ''La Corunna'', ''A Coru<U+00F1>a'', ''La Coru<U+00F1>a'', ''Elvi<U+00F1>a'',  or ''La Corogne'') refers to a battle of the [[Peninsular War]]. On 16 January 1809,  a French army under [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]] attacked the British under [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]]. The British had retreated across northern Spain following the defeat of the Spanish and their allies in the campaign and were attempting to embark on ships and return to England.<ref>''Letters from Portugal and Spain'', Adam Neale, London, 1809, pp.100-104, Letters from Dec.10, 1808 from both Moore and Berthier indicate that both sides are aware the allies are defeated and the British are in full retreat. Moore, "I had no time to lose to secure my retreat.", Berthier, "...everything inclines us to think that they (the British) are in full retreat...".</ref>

==Background==
[[File:Sir John Moore by Sir Thomas Lawrence.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sir John Moore, the British commander]]
In early October 1808 Sir John Moore, following the scandal in Britain of the [[Convention of Cintra]] and the recall of the generals [[Sir Hew Dalrymple, 1st Baronet, of High Mark|Dalrymple]], [[Sir Harry Burrard, 1st Baronet, of Lymington|Burrard]] and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellesley]], took  command of the 30,000 man British force in Portugal.<ref>Richardson, Hubert N.B..''A dictionary of Napoleon and his times'', New York, 1920, p. 343.</ref> In addition, on 8 October [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|Sir David Baird]] in command of an expedition of reinforcements out of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] consisting of 150 transports carrying between 12,000 and 13,000 men, convoyed by H.M.S. Louie, [[HMS Amelia (1796)|Amelia]] and [[HMS Champion|Champion]], on the 13th entered Corunna Harbour.<ref>Gay, Susan E.. ''Old Falmouth'', London, 1903, p. 231.</ref> By November 1808 the British army, led by Moore, advanced into Spain with orders to assist the Spanish armies in their struggle against the invading forces of [[Napoleon]].<ref>Oman, p. 492.</ref>

After the surrender of a French army corps at [[Battle of Bail<U+00E9>n|Bail<U+00E9>n]]<ref>Chandler, p. 617. "This was an historic occasion; news of it spread like wildfire throughout Spain and then all Europe. It was the first time since 1801 that a sizable French force had laid down its arms, and the legend of French invincibility underwent a severe shaking. Everywhere anti-French elements drew fresh inspiration from the tidings. The Pope published an open denunciation of Napoleon; Prussian patriots were heartened; and, most significantly of all, the Austrian war party began to secure the support of the Emperor Francis for a renewed challenge to the French Empire.".</ref> and the loss of Portugal Napoleon was convinced of the peril he faced in Spain. Deeply disturbed by news of Cintra, the Emperor remarked, {{cquote|I see that everybody has lost their head since the infamous capitulation of Bail<U+00E9>n. I realise that I must go there myself to get the machine working again.<ref>Chandler, p. 620.</ref>}}
The French, all but masters of Spain in June, stood with their backs to the [[Pyrenees]], clutching at [[Navarre]] and [[Catalonia]]. It was not known if even these two footholds could be maintained in the face of a Spanish attack. By October French strength in Spain, including garrisons, was about 75,000 soldiers. They were facing 86,000 Spanish troops<ref>Richardson, p. 343.</ref> with Spain's 35,000 British allies en route.<ref>Oman, p. 648.</ref>

However, no attack was forthcoming. The Spanish social fabric, shaken by the shock of rebellion, gave way to its crippling social and political tensions; the patriots stood divided on every question and their nascent war effort suffered accordingly. With the fall of the monarchy, constitutional power devolved to local [[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]]. These institutions interfered with the army and the business of war, undermined the tentative central government taking shape in Madrid,<ref>Chandler, p. 625. Chandler notes that "the particular interests of the provincial delegates made even the pretense of centralised government a travesty."</ref> and in some cases proved almost as dangerous to each other as to the French.<ref>Chandler, p. 621. John Lawrence Tone has questioned this assessment of the Spanish juntas on the grounds that it relies too much on the accounts of British officers and elites; these sources being patently unfair to the revolutionaries, "whom they despised for being Jacobins, Catholics, and Spaniards, not necessarily in that order."</ref> The British army in Portugal, meanwhile, was itself immobilized by [[logistics|logistical]] problems and bogged down in administrative disputes, and did not budge.<ref>Chandler, p. 628.</ref>

Months of inaction had passed at the front, the revolution having "temporarily crippled Patriot Spain at the very moment when decisive action could have changed the whole course of the war."<ref>Esdaille, pp. 304<U+2013>305. Esdaille notes that the Junta of Seville declared itself the supreme government of Spain and tried to annex neighbouring juntas by force.</ref> While the allies inched forward, a vast consolidation of bodies and bayonets from the far reaches of the French Empire brought 100,000 veterans of the [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]] into Spain, led in person by Napoleon and his [[Marshal of France|Marshals]].<ref>Gates, p. 487.</ref> With his ''Arm<U+00E9>e d'Espagne'' of 278,670 men drawn up on the Ebro, facing a scant 80,000 raw, disorganized Spanish troops, the Emperor announced to the Spanish deputies:<ref>Glover, p. 55.</ref>{{cquote|I am here with the soldiers who conquered at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], at [[Battle of Jena|Jena]], at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]]. Who can withstand ''them''? Certainly not your wretched Spanish troops who do not know how to fight. I shall conquer Spain in two months and acquire the rights of a conqueror.}} Starting in October 1808 Napoleon led the French on a brilliant<ref>Chandler, p. 631.</ref> offensive involving a massive [[double envelopment]] of the Spanish lines. The attack began in November and has been described as "an avalanche of fire and steel."<ref>Churchill, p. 262.</ref>

For a time the British army was dangerously dispersed with Baird at Astorga to the north, Moore at Salamanca and Hope 70 miles to the east near Madrid<ref>Haythornthwaite, p. 27.</ref> with all the cavalry and artillery.<ref>Oman, p. 598.</ref> The main army, under Moore, had advanced to [[Salamanca]] and were joined by Hope's detachment on 3 December when Moore received news that the Spanish forces had suffered several defeats. He considered that to avoid disaster he must give up and retreat to the coast.<ref>Chandler (London) p.645, in which he quotes from Moore's diary: "I have determined to give this thing up and retire" - Sir J.Moore, ''Diaries'', Major General Sir J.F.Maurice, ed. (London:190), Vol II, p.358.</ref>  

Before retreating he received intelligence<ref>Fortescue, pp. 326-327.</ref> of Soult's 16,000 man corps' scattered and isolated position at Carrion<ref>Fremont-Barnes, p.35.</ref>and that the French were unaware of his position. On 15 December he seized at this opportunity to advance on the French near Madrid hoping that he might defeat Soult and possibly divert Napoleon<U+2019>s forces.<ref>Neale, Adam. ''Letters from Portugal and Spain'', London, 1809, Letters from Dec.10, 1808  P. 104, Moore: "I have made the movement against Soult; as a diversion it has answered completely, but as there is nothing to take advantage of it, I have risked the loss of my army for no purpose."</ref> A junction with General [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|David Baird]] on 20 December, advancing from Corunna, raised Moore's strength to 23,500 infantry, 2,400 cavalry<ref>Haythornthwaite, p.45.</ref> and 60 guns<ref>''The Origin and History of the First Or Grenadier Guards'' Vol.II, London 1874, Frederick William Hamilton, p.385. Neale, Adam, et al. ''Memorials of the Late War Vol.I,'' Edinburgh 1831, gives: 28,900 men (2450 cavalry) and 50 guns, p.171.</ref> and he opened his attack with a successful raid by Paget's cavalry on the French piquets at [[Battle of Sahag<U+00FA>n|Sahag<U+00FA>n]] on 21 December.<ref>Gates, p. 108.</ref> However, Moore failed to follow up against a surprised Soult, halting for two days and allowing Soult to concentrate his corps.<ref>Chandler, p. 648.</ref>

==The retreat to Corunna==
[[File:Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marshal Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult, the French commander]]
Once Moore made his presence known Napoleon responded with customary swiftness and decisiveness. With the Spanish defeated and no longer an organized threat, his army generally concentrated while the enemy was dispersed and the initiative firmly in his grasp Napoleon seized the chance to destroy Britain's only field army.<ref>Haythornthwaite, p. 28. Chandler, pp. 645, 657. Oman, pp. 503, 601.</ref> When Moore realized he was in serious danger of being trapped he called off his advance and went into headlong retreat.<ref>Gates, p.110.</ref> This epic dash and chase would cover more than 200 miles.<ref>Napier, p.129.</ref> The British cavalry often successfully covered the movements of Moore's army, engaging the French in small rearguard clashes after Moore's retreat began on 25 December, one at [[Battle of Benavente|Benavente]] before it entered the mountainous terrain of Galicia.<ref>Fitchett. p.74.</ref>

The retreat of the British, closely followed by their French pursuers, took them through mountainous terrain in dreadful conditions of cold and snow and was marked by exhausting marches, privation, and suffering. Moore was joined at Astorga by general [[Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana|Romana]] leading the remnants of Blake's Spanish forces and Romana proposed they make a stand. However, with Napoleon closing in, Moore declined and continued his retreat North while Romana went West towards Portugal.<ref>Haythornthwaite, p. 52.</ref> On the march between Astorga and [[Betanzos]] the British army lost 3,000 men with 500 more left in hospitals at Astorga and Villafranca.<ref>Howard, M.R..''Medical aspects of Sir John Moore's Corunna Campaign, 1808-1809'', ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'', Volume 84, May 1991, p. 300.</ref> 

Napoleon had attempted to speedily catch the British and force them to fight. He led the French army 200 miles over 10 days by forced marches and in spite of winter blizzard conditions reached Astorga on 1 January with 80,000 men.<ref>Fitchett, p.76</ref> Napoleon maneuvered to cut Moore off from a retreat to Portugal. Moore had already planned that he would have to be ready to make a run for the coast. On 28 November Moore had ordered his Corunna contingent under Baird to embark from Vigo while the main British army was to fall back on Portugal but by 28 December he had decided to embark the whole army at Vigo.<ref name="Elleman, Duffy, p. 18">Elleman, Duffy, p. 18.</ref> Abandoning Astorga on 30 December, he would manage to keep ahead of the pursuing French and avoid a major battle. Moore ordered Crawford and two brigades as well as the troop transport ships to the port of [[Vigo]]. Napoleon would write to his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], with more than a little  truth,<ref>Neale, Adam, et al. ''Memorials of the Late War Vol.I,'', pp. 175-176. See Esdaile for Spanish reaction to British behavior etc. pp.151, 197-198.</ref> on 31 December: {{cquote|My vanguard is near Astorga; the English are running away as fast as they can ... they are abhorred by everybody; they have carried off everything, and then maltreated and beaten the inhabitants. There could not have been a better sedative for Spain than to send an English army.<ref>Fichett, pp.76-77.</ref>}} When it was clear that he could not bring Moore to battle, Napoleon left the pursuit of the British to the corps of Marshal Soult with [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]] in support and took the bulk of the army, some 45,000 men, back to Madrid.<ref>Gates, p.111</ref> Napoleon decided to leave Spain to attend to other pressing matters; the Austrians were about to declare war on France, and would soon invade Italy and Bavaria.<ref>''A History of England and Greater Britain'', Arthur Lyon Cross, Macmillan, 1914, p. 854. ''Revolutionary Europe, 1789-1815'', Henry Morse Stephens, London, 1900, p. 271.

Several times the discipline of the British broke down, on 28 December British troops pillaged and looted [[Benavente, Zamora|Benavente]],<ref>Fremont-Barnes, p. 38.</ref> at [[Bembibre]] on 2  January, hundreds of British soldiers got so inebriated on wine, and not for the first or last time,<ref>Fitchett, p. 78. Esdaile, p. 151. Napier, p. 119. Oman, pp.577-578.</ref> that they had to be abandoned and were captured or cut to pieces by the pursuing French dragoons.<ref>Fortescue, p. 364.</ref> Similar incidents took place including one in which French pursuit was so close there was not time enough for [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Paget]], commander of the British rear guard, to complete the hanging of three British soldiers, as an example, for the pillaging a Spanish town.<ref>Fortescue, p.366.</ref> French cavalry General Colbert in hot, close pursuit was killed at the bridge at the village of Cacabello after driving off the British 15th Hussars and riding down the Riflemen, capturing about 50.<ref>Fortescue, pp. 367-368.</ref> 

Moore made a stand before the old Roman town of [[Lugo]] on 6 January and offered battle but, initially, Soult's forces were too strung out.<ref>Chandler, p.655.</ref> Over 2 days Soult concentrated his troops and tried to get Ney to send a division from Villa Franca del Bierzo but Ney sent few troops. By the 8th Soult was prepared for battle, but Moore, imagining Ney was outflanking him, slipped away that night,<ref>Napier, p.119.</ref> shooting 500 foundered horses and destroying artillery caissons and food stores.<ref>Oman, p. 576.</ref> Now realizing he could not get to Vigo and fearing his army would disintegrate on the way,<ref name="Elleman, Duffy, p. 18"/> he ordered the transports to Betanzos Bay between Corunna and [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and he headed for Corunna.<ref>Neale, ''Memoirs'', p. 214-215.</ref>

Rain storms and confusion caused the British main body to partially lose order and break up with thousands straggling and 500 captured by pursuing French dragoons with hundreds more stragglers captured by Franceschi's cavalry on the 10th and several hundred more on the 11th.<ref>Fortescue, pp. 372-374. Oman gives more than 1,000 lost, p. 580.</ref> The loss of troops between Lugo and Betanzos was greater than all of that of the  preceding retreat.<ref>Napier, p.120.</ref> Eventually, on 11 January, the British main body reached the port of [[A Coru<U+00F1>a|Corunna]] in northwest Spain, where they had hoped to find the fleet to take them back them to England<ref>Neale, referred to on p. 198 as ''Sir John Moore<U+2019>s Last Despatch'': <U+201C>If I succeed in embarking the army, I shall send it to England - it is quite unfit for further service, until it has been refitted, which can best be done there.<U+201D></ref> but found Betanzos Bay empty and only 26  transports and 2 warships at Corunna.<ref name="Elleman, Duffy, p. 18"/> The rest of the 245 ships had been delayed by contrary winds only arriving at Vigo on the 8th and would not depart until the 13th.<ref>Elleman, Duffy, p. 18. Fortescue, p. 375.</ref>

The French had also suffered severe fatigue and deprivation during their pursuit having to travel over ground already stripped bare and devastated by the British.<ref>Oman, p. 581.</ref> While the French cavalry was able to continually press the British rear guard and prevent effective [[reconnaissance]] by the British cavalry, Soult's infantry had trouble keeping up and was badly strung out and well behind the cavalry. Soult's three infantry divisions, commanded by Merle, Mermet and Laborde, and his artillery would arrive at Corunna piecemeal over the next few days.<ref>Oman, p. 584.</ref>

==Arrival of the armies before Corunna==

The British army arrived in Corunna on 11 January and there were found only the [[Ships of the Line]] and hospital ships to which the many wounded were embarked. There was also a large quantity of badly needed military stores: 5,000 new muskets, a vast amount of cartridges for re-equipping, numerous Spanish artillery pieces and plenty of supplies.<ref>Haythornthwaite, p. 66.</ref>

The French army began to arrive the next day, building up strength as they arrived from the march; Soult<U+2019>s artillery arriving on 14 January.  The long-awaited transport ships also arrived on the 14th and that evening the British evacuated their sick, some horses and most of the remaining field guns, cavalrymen and gunners. There was no intention by the British of garrisoning and holding on to Corunna as a future base with its extensive stores and certain support from the sea.<ref>Oman, p.598: "... arguments for attempting a defence of Galicia were more weighty than has been allowed."; pp. 554-555</ref> The British then destroyed a portion of the enormous amount of military stores originally intended for the Spanish: nearly 12,000 barrels of powder, 300,000 cartridges in two magazines outside the town and 50 fortress guns and 20 mortars.<ref>Haythornthwaite, p.66. Napier, indicates a magazine and a storehouse outside Corunna, p.120. Oman indicates "The town was, in fact, crammed with munitions of all sorts.", p. 582. Hugo, pp. 110-111,' inventories an additional vast amount of stores captured by the French following the battle inside Corunna.</ref> 

The British embarked nearly all their cannon and artillerists and, as the terrain was unsuitable for cavalry, all their troopers and a few healthy horses but killed some 2,000 of the cavalry's horses.<ref>Fitchett, 290 horses from the KGL alone, p. 86. Napier, p.120. Hugo, p.111, mentions 1,200 "cadavers de chevaux". Oman, p.582, gives 2,000 horses killed.</ref> Moore now actually had the advantage in numbers in infantry, 15,000<ref>''The Origin and History of the First Or Grenadier Guards'' Vol.II, London 1874, Frederick William Hamilton, gives 14,500, p.392. Oman ''A History of the Peninsular War Vol. I, 1807-1809'', p.582, gives 15,000.</ref> to 12,000<ref>Fortescue states the British had 15,000 infantry to the French 12,000, p. 381.</ref> and, with the rough ground much broken up by sunken roads and walls, Soult's cavalry would be of little use. The British were rearmed, well rested and well fed<ref>Oman, p.580.</ref> in marked contrast to the oncoming French.<ref>Oman, p.582.</ref>

Moore had deployed his army to cover the evacuation by placing the main part of it on a ridge astride the road to Corunna, a mile and a half south of the harbour. A stronger position lay to the south but the British commander considered that he lacked the numbers to defend it properly and had to be content with placing outposts there to slow the approach of the French.  The left flank was covered by the river Mero and the left and centre of the ridge was quite defensible. The western and lower end of this ridge was more vulnerable and could be swept by guns on the rocky heights of the loftier range opposite, and the ground further west consisted of more open terrain extending as far as Corunna which might provide the means of turning the whole position.  Moore held two divisions back in reserve a little north and westwards in order to guard the right flank and to prevent a turning movement.<ref>Oman, p. 583.</ref>

On 15 January French troops pushed back the British outposts on the higher range and gradually took up position there. A counter attack by British [[5th Foot]] was repulsed with heavy loss.<ref>Gates, p. 112.</ref>  Soult sited his 11 heavy guns upon the rocky outcrop from where they would be able to fire upon the British right.  The task was very difficult and it was night before the guns had been dragged into position.<ref name="Napier, p. 121">Napier, p. 121.</ref> Laborde's division was posted on the right and Merle's in the center with Mermet on the left. The light field guns of the French were distributed across the front of their position,<ref name="Napier, p. 121">Napier, p. 121.</ref> however the broken ground, sunken roads and walls limited them to long range support. The French cavalry was deployed to the East of the line. For the British Baird's division formed on the right and Hope's the left each deploying a brigade ''en potence'' with Paget as the reserve at the village Airis.<ref>Oman, p.584.</ref>

==Battle==
[[File:Battle of Corunna.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Army positions at Corunna]]
As day broke on 16 January the French were in position on the heights, and all through the morning both armies observed each across the valley between them.  Moore planned to continue with the embarkation later that day if Soult did not attack.  By afternoon Moore considered an attack unlikely and ordered the first divisions to make their way to the port; the rest of the army would follow at dusk, but shortly after, at 2pm,<ref name="Napier, p. 121"/> he learned that the French were attacking.<ref>Oman, p. 586.</ref>

Soult's plan was to move against the strongly-placed British infantry of the left and centre in order to contain it while the infantry division of Mermet attacked the more vulnerable British right above the village of Elvina.  The cavalry was deployed further west near the more open country leading to Corunna.  If the attacks succeeded they could seize the western end of the British lines and push on to cut off the bulk of the army from Corunna.<ref>Oman, p. 586.</ref>

Mermet<U+2019>s infantry advanced quickly and soon pushed the British picquets back, carrying the town of Elvina and attacking the heights beyond. The first French column divided into two   with Gaulois' and Jardon's brigades attacking Baird front and flank, and the third French brigade pushing up the valley on the British right in an attempt to turn their flank with Lahoussaye's dragoons moving with difficulty over the broken ground and walls trying to cover the left of the French advance.<ref>Oman, p.587.</ref>

The fiercest fighting took place in and around Elvina as the possession of this village would change hands several times, and the British suffered particularly from the fire of the heavy artillery on the heights opposite. As the French attack broke through Elvina came up the hill behind it, Moore sent in the [[50th Foot]] and the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|Black Watch]] to stop the French infantry<ref name="Napier, p. 121"/> while the 4th Foot held the left flank of the British line. The ground around the village was broken up by numerous stone walls and hollow roads. Moore remained in this area to direct the battle ordering the [[4th Foot]] to fire down upon the flank of the second French column that was attempting the turning movement and calling up the reserve under Paget to meet it. The British advance carried beyond the village when some confusion by the British and Mermet's reserves drove into and through Elvina again and chasing the 50th and 42nd back up the slope. Moore called up his divisional reserve, two battalions of the Guards, some 800 men and together with the 42nd halted the French advance.<ref>Oman. p.588</ref>

The British commander had just rallied the 42nd Black Watch regiment<ref>Knight, Charles, ''The Popular History of England'', London, 1861, p. 506.</ref> that had fallen back from Elvina  and had ordered the Guards to advance on the village<ref>Oman, p. 588.</ref> when he was struck by a cannonball. He fell mortally wounded, being "struck in his left breast and shoulder by a cannon shot, which broke his ribs, his arm, lacerated his shoulder and the whole of his left side and lungs". He remained conscious, and composed, throughout the several hours of his dying. The second advance again drove the French back through Elvina. Mermet now threw in his last reserves with one of Merle's brigade attacking the east side of the village. This was countered by an advance by Manningham's brigade and a long fire-fight broke out between two British: the 3/[[1st Foot|1st]] and the 2/[[81st Foot|81st]] and two French regiments: the 2nd L<U+00E9>gere and 36th Ligne of Reynaud's brigade. The 81st was forced out of the fight and relieved by the 2/[[59th Foot|59th]] and the fighting petered out here late in the day with the French finally retiring.<ref>Oman. p. 591.</ref> 

For a time the British were without a leader until General John Hope took command as Baird was also seriously wounded. This hampered attempts at a counterattack in the crucial sector of Elvina, but the fighting continued unabated.<ref>Hugo, p. 110: "The enemy was not even discouraged by two fatal events: General Baird was shot in the arm with a bullet, and the commander-in-chief Moore was mortally wounded.  General John Hope replaced him as commander and the enemy continued to maintain their position throughout the line."</ref>

Further west the French cavalry pushed forward as part of the flank attack and made a few charges   but they were impeded by the rough terrain. Lahoussaye dismounted some his Dragoons which fought as skirmishers  but they were eventually driven back by the advance of the [[95th Rifles]], [[28th Foot]] and [[91st Foot]] of the British reserves. Franceschi's cavalry moved to flank the extreme right of the British attempting to cut them off at the gates of Corunna but were countered again by the terrain and Fraser's division drawn up on the Santa Margarita ridge which covered the neck of the peninsula and the gates. As Lahoussaye retired, Franceschi conformed with his movement.<ref>Oman, p. 590. Napier, p. 122.</ref>

Night brought an end to the fighting by which time the French attacks had been repulsed and they returned to their original positions; both sides holding much the same ground as before the fight.<ref>Oman, p. 592.</ref>

==Aftermath==
Command of the British army had passed to [[John Hope, 4th Earl of Hopetoun|General Hope]] who decided to continue the embarkation rather than to attempt  to hold their ground<ref>Napier, p. 165, suggests that both Corunna and Ferrol could have been held for months.</ref> or attack Soult.<ref>Fitchett, in ''How England Saved Europe'', suggests that only Moore's death prevented the total destruction of Soult, and that Hope "forbore" to press the French, p.94. Oman, p. 592, offers a more realistic appraisal of Hope's chances.</ref> At around 9 PM the British began to silently withdraw from their lines, leaving behind strong [[Picket (military)|picquets]] who maintained watch-fires throughout the night.<ref name="Pococke">Pococke, pp. 94-96.</ref>

At daybreak on 17 January the picquets were withdrawn behind the rearguard and went aboard ship; by morning most of the army had embarked.<ref name="Pococke" />  When Soult perceived that the British had left the ridge, he posted six guns on the heights above the southern end of the bay and by midday the French were able fire upon the outlying ships.  This caused panic amongst some of the transports four of which ran aground and were then burned to prevent their capture. The battery was silenced by fire from the warships.<ref name="Pococke" />

On 18 January, the British rearguard embarked as the Spanish garrison under General Alcedo "faithfully"<ref>Napier, pp. 122, 165.</ref> held the citadel until the fleet was well out to sea before surrendering.<ref>Fortescue, p. 393. Oman, p.596, actually has the effrontery to criticize Alcedo for not putting up more of a fight for the town which the British, having destroyed much of its defenses, had themselves had just abandoned to its fate. Similarly, Napier p. 165.</ref> The city of Corunna was taken by the French, two Spanish regiments surrendering along with 500 horses and considerable military stores captured including numerous cannon, 20,000 muskets, hundreds of thousands of cartridges and tons of gunpowder.<ref>Hugo, A.. ''France militaire : histoire des arm<U+00E9>es fran<U+00E7>aises de terre et de mer de 1792 <U+00E0> 1837'', pp.110-111. Hugo gives an inventory of 200 cannon, 20,000 muskets, 200,000 pounds of powder, 600,000 cartridges captured when the city is taken. Oman, "''The town'' (emphasis added) was, in fact, crammed with munitions of all sorts.", p. 582.</ref> A week later Soult's forces captured Ferrol, a major Spanish naval base across the bay, taking eight  [[ships of the line]], three with 112 guns, two with 80, one 74, two 64s, 3 frigates and numerous corvettes, as well as a large arsenal with over 1,000 cannon and military stores of all kinds.<ref>Hugo, p. 111. Also, Belmas, p. 55. Napier, p. 165.</ref>

As a result of the battle the British suffered around 900 men dead or wounded and had killed all their nearly 2,000 cavalry horses and as many as 4,000 more horses of the artillery and train.<ref>Hugo, p.110, gives 6,000 horses dead from fatigue or killed by the British and 2,500 soldiers killed or wounded with many wounded abandoned. Fortescue says 1,000 horses were saved, p. 377. Oman, p. 582, says only 250 cavalry horses and 700 artillery draught cattle were saved. The remainder that he puts at 2,000 were killed, but may only be the rest of the cavalry's horses and not included the rest of the transport horses etc. since on p. 646 he gives the cavalry initial strength as 3,078 with 2,800 troopers embarking at Corunna.</ref> The French lost around 1,000 men  killed, wounded or captured.<ref>Chandler and Oman give 1,500. Fortescue and Esdaile both state casualties about equal at some 900 per side.</ref>  The most notable casualty was the British commander [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]], who survived long enough to learn of his success. Moore's second in command Sir David Baird was seriously wounded earlier in the battle and had to retire from the field.  In addition two of Mermet's three brigadiers were also casualties: Gaulois was shot dead and Lefebvre badly hurt.  These men were all involved in the fighting on the British right.<ref>Oman, p. 594.</ref>

On the morning of the battle 4,035 British were listed sick, a few hundred of these were too sick to embark and were left behind.<ref>Oman, p. 582</ref> Two more transports were lost with about 300 troops mostly from the [[King's German Legion]].<ref>Haythornthwaite, Philip, ''Corunna 1809'' (Campaign 83), Osprey Publishing Ltd., 2001, ISBN 1 85532 968 9, p.87.</ref> By the time the army returned to England four days later some 6,000 were ill, with the sick returns listed at Portsmouth and Plymouth alone as 5,000.<ref>Howard, M.R..''Medical aspects of Sir John Moore's Corunna Campaign, 1808-1809'', ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'', Volume 84, May 1991, p. 300.</ref>

Within ten days the French had captured two fortresses containing an immense amount of military [[mat<U+00E9>riel]] which, with more resolution, could have been defended  against the French for many months.<ref>Napier, p.165</ref> Soult was able to refit his corps, which had been on the march and fighting since 9 November, with the captured stores so that, with his stragglers now closed up on the main body, he was able to begin his march on Portugal on 1 February with a strength of 19,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 58 guns.<ref>Napier, p. 166</ref>

==Analysis==
[[Image:Monolito Moore (Front).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Moore's monolith in the old battlefield, now a campus of the University of Corunna]]

The British army had been sent into Spain to aid in expelling the French, but they had been forced into a humiliating retreat in terrible winter conditions that wrought havoc with health and morale and resulted in the army degenerating into a rabble.  In his authoritative account of the battle, the English historian [[Christopher Hibbert]] states: "It was all very well to talk of the courage and endurance of the troops but of what use were these virtues alone when pitted against the genius of Napoleon?  35,000 men had crossed the Spanish frontier against him; 8000 had not returned.  We were unworthy of our great past."<ref name="Christopher Hibbert 1961 p. 188.">Christopher Hibbert, ''Corunna'' (London: Batsford, 1961), p. 188.</ref>  The British of the day similarly viewed Corunna as a defeat: according to ''[[The Times]]'', "The fact must not be disguised ... that we have suffered a shameful disaster."  <ref name="Christopher Hibbert 1961 p. 188."/>  

The historian [[Charles Oman]] contends that Marshal Soult's attack at Corunna provided Moore and his men with the opportunity to redeem their honour and reputation through their defensive victory,<ref>Oman p. 587, "Moore welcomed the approach of battle with joy : he had every confidence in his men and his position, and saw that a victory won ere his departure would silence the greater part of the inevitable criticism for timidity and want of enterprise, to which he would be exposed on his return to England."</ref> by which means the army was saved though at the cost of the British general's life. Moore was buried wrapped in a military cloak in the ramparts of the town; the funeral is celebrated in a well-known poem by [[Charles Wolfe (poet)|Charles Wolfe]] (1791<U+2013>1823), "The Burial of Sir John Moore after Corunna".<ref>*''Burial of Sir John Moore at Corunna'', by Rev. Charles Wolfe (1791-1823)[http://www.sandgate-kent.org.uk/moore.htm]</ref>

Charles Esdaile, in ''The Pennisular War: A New History'', writes: "In military terms, Moore's decision to retreat was therefore probably sensible enough but in other respects it was a disaster ... Having failed to appear in time ... then allowed Madrid to fall without a shot, the British now seemed to be abandoning Spain altogether." Also, "Even worse than the physical losses suffered by the allies was the immense damage done to Anglo-Spanish relations. ... de la Romana ... openly accusing Moore of betrayal and bad faith." Finally, "... the occupation (by the French) of the most heavily populated region in the whole of Spain."<ref>Esdaile, pp.151 -156.</ref> 

Chandler states, the British army had been "... compelled to conduct a precipitate retreat and evacuate by sea.", "Madrid and the Northern half of Spain were under occupation by French troops.".<ref name="Chandler, p.658">Chandler, p.658.</ref> Fremont-Barnes, in ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Peninsular War 1807-1814'', writes that the then British Foreign Secretary [[George Canning|Canning]]: "privately condemned Moore's failed campaign in increasingly stronger terms" while in public he " ... in the great British tradition of characterizing defeat as victory, insisted that although Moore's army had been pushed out of Spain his triumph at the battle of Corunna had left 'fresh laurels blooming upon our brows'.".<ref>Fremont-Barnes, pp. 79-80.</ref>

A more charitable view is offered by W.H. Fitchett in ''How England Saved Europe:The story of the Great War, Vol.III, The war in the Peninsula'': "... it is also a dramatic justification of Moore's strategy that he had drawn a hostile force so formidable into a hilly corner of Spain, thus staying its southward rush."<ref>Fitchett, p. 76.</ref>  Napier similarly speculates: "[t]he second sweep that [Napoleon] was preparing to make when Sir John Moore's march called off his attention from the south would undoubtedly have put him in possession of the remaining great cities of the peninsula."<ref>''History of the War in the Peninsula and in the South of France from the year 1807 to the year 1814, Vol. 1'', W.F.P. Napier, (Philadelphia: Carey and Hart, 1842), p. 266.</ref>

Nevertheless back in England the reaction to news of the Battle of Corunna and the safe evacuation of the army was a storm of criticism over Moore<U+2019>s handling of the campaign, while back in Corunna his adversary Marshal Soult took care of Moore's grave and ordered a monument to be raised<ref>Mike Wade. ''Sir John Moore, general who beat a victorious retreat'', ''The Times'', London, 16 January 2009. Oman, p. 595.</ref> in his memory.<ref name="Chandler, p.658"/>
