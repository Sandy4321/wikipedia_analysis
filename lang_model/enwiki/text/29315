:''This article is about the boy who attempted to build a nuclear reactor. For the Democratic candidate for governor of Nebraska, see [[David Hahn (Nebraska)]].''

'''David Hahn''' (born October 1976) attempted to build a [[nuclear reactor|nuclear]] [[fast breeder|breeder reactor]] in 1994 in his backyard shed in [[Commerce Township, Michigan|Commerce Township]], [[Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit]], at the age of 17.

Hahn, nicknamed the "'''Radioactive Boy Scout'''", is an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] who had previously earned a [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badge]] in Atomic Energy and had spent years tinkering with basement [[chemistry]] which included small explosions. Furthering his experiments, Hahn diligently amassed significant [[radioactive]] material by collecting small amounts from (occasionally stolen) household products, such as [[americium]] from [[smoke detector]]s, [[thorium]] from camping lantern [[gas mantle|mantles]] and [[radium]] from clocks and gunsights. He also obtained [[radium]] from the Undark paint which older clocks used to light their dials, and [[lithium]] from batteries. His reactor was a large, cored-out block of [[lead]].

Hahn posed as a legitimate adult scientist or teacher, gaining the trust of many professionals, despite misspellings and obvious errors in his letters. Hahn ultimately hoped to create a breeder reactor, using low-level [[isotope]]s to transform samples of thorium and [[uranium]] into [[Nuclear fission|fission]]able isotopes.

Although his home-made reactor never achieved [[Critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]], it ended up emitting toxic levels of radioactivity, around 1000 times normal [[background radiation]]. Alarmed, Hahn began to dismantle his experiments, but a chance encounter with police led to the discovery of his activities, which triggered a Federal Radiological Emergency involving the [[FBI]] and [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]]. The [[Environmental Protection Agency]], having designated Hahn's mother's property as a [[Superfund]] hazardous materials cleanup site, dismantled the shed and contents and buried it as low-level [[radioactive waste]] in [[Utah]]. Hahn refused medical evaluation for [[radiation exposure]].

Hahn suffered local ignominy, but did achieve Eagle Scout. After dropping out of [[community college]], Hahn joined the [[United States Navy|Navy]], assigned to the nuclear-powered [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'']] as an ordinary [[seaman]] (where he was kept away from the nuclear reactors, largely for his own safety, as he had reached the point that further exposure would result in illness), later re-enlisting as a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]].

The incident received scant media attention at the time, but was widely disseminated after writer [[Ken Silverstein]] published an article about the incident in [[Harper's Magazine]] in 1998, and subsequently expanded it into a 2004 biography, ''The Radioactive Boy Scout: The Frightening True Story of a Whiz Kid and His Homemade Nuclear Reactor.''

A television documentary, ''The Nuclear Boyscout'', ran on [[Channel 4]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2003.  In the show, Hahn reenacted some of his methods for the camera.  Though slated for the [[Discovery Channel]], the show has not yet been aired in the [[United States]].
