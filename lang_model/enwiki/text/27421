== Appearance, size and colouration ==
In the wild, male ''P. pulcher'' grow to a maximum length of approximately 12.5 [[centimeter|cm]] (4.9 [[inch|in.]]) and a maximum weight of 9.5 [[gram|g]].  Females are smaller and deeper bodied, growing to a maximum length of 8.1 cm (3.2 in.) and a maximum weight of 9.4 g.<ref name="Nwadiaro">Nwadiaro, CS (1985)  The distribution and food habits of the dwarf African cichlid, Pelvicachromis pulcher in the River Sombreiro, Nigeria.

==Distribution, habitat and predators==
''P. pulcher'' is native to southern Nigeria and to coastal areas of Cameroon, where it occurs in warm (24<U+2013>26 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]], 75-79 [[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]), acidic to neutral ([[PH|''p''H]] 5.6 - 6.2), [[Hard water|soft water]] (12-22 mg L<sup>-1</sup> [CaCO<sub>3</sub>]).<ref name="wacichlids"/><ref name="Nwadiaro"/> The species inhabits both slow and fast-moving water, though it is only found where patches of dense vegetation are available.<ref name="wacichlids"/> Other fish that share the habitat of ''P. pulcher'' include other ''Pelvicachromis'' species (''[[Pelvicachromis taeniatus]]''), other cichlid species (''[[Chromidotilapia|Chromidotilapia guntheri]]'', ''[[Hemichromis|Hemichromis cristatus]]'' and ''[[Hemichromis|H. fasciatus]]'', ''[[Tilapia mariae]]'' and ''[[Tilapia (genus)|T. zilli]]'') along with ''[[Alestiidae|Brycinus longipinnis]]'' and  ''[[Aplocheilidae|Aphyosemion]]'' species.<ref name="wacichlids"/> The species is prey for a number of [[rheophile|rheophilic]] predators including ''[[Hepsetus odoe]]'', ''[[Tigerfish|Hydrocynus forskahlii]]'' and ''Lates niloticus'' ([[Nile perch]]).<ref name="Nwadiaro"/> In the natural habitat, ''P. pulcher'' have been observed excavating, defending and sheltering in caves dug underneath plants, and these holes are also used for breeding.<ref name="martin"/> Not all ''P. pulcher'', however, claim territories and many live in large, non-reproductive aggregates.<ref name="martin"/><ref>Sj<U+00F6>lander S (1972) Feldbeobachtungen an einigen westafrikanischen Cichliden. ''Aquarien-Terrar. Mschr. Ornith. Vivar.''  '''19:''' 42-45</ref>

===Feral populations===
Populations of  ''P. pulcher'' also occur outside its natural range in [[Hawaii]], [[USA]] as a by-product of the ornamental fish trade.<ref>Yamamoto, MN (1992) Occurrence, distribution and abundance of accidentally introduced freshwater aquatic organisms in Hawaii. State of Hawaii, Federal Aid in Sportfish Restoration, Dingell-Johnson JOR. Freshwater Fisheries Research and Surveys, Project No. F-14-R-16.</ref>

==Name==
Originally ''P. kribnesis'', its Latin name was changed to ''P. pulcher''. Pulcher is Latin for beautiful.

==Diet==
Despite the suggestion in some aquarium literature that the species feeds on [[worm]]s, [[crustacean]]s and [[insect]]s,<ref>Mills, D; Vevers, G (1989) ''The Tetra encyclopedia of freshwater tropical aquarium fishes.'' Tetra Press, New Jersey. p. 208</ref> analysis of the stomach contents of wild ''P. pulcher'' suggests this is incorrect. A study by Nwadiaro (1985)<ref name="Nwadiaro"/> of 161 individuals showed that the main food items were [[diatoms]], [[green algae]], pieces of [[plant|higher plants]] along with [[blue-green algae]]. [[Invertebrates]], though consumed, were found to be relatively uncommon food items for wild fish.

==Sexual dimorphism and reproduction==
Like other ''Pelvicachromis'' species, ''P. pulcher'' is sexually dimorphic. Males have a pointed pelvic fin, while the females' pelvic fin is more rounded in appearance. In addition, males are larger, lack the gold sheen to the dorsal fin and have a more elongated, spade-shaped caudal fin.<ref name="wacichlids"/><ref name="Loiselle">{{cite book |last=Loiselle |first=Paul V. |coauthors= |title=The Cichlid Aquarium |year=1995 |publisher=Tetra Press |location=Germany |isbn=1-56465-146-0}}</ref> Despite the suggestion in the aquarium literature that the species forms monogamous pairs,<ref name="baensch"/> the formation of [[Polygyny#Animal_polygyny|polygynous]] harems is not uncommon in the natural habitat.<ref name="martin"/> The species are secretive cave spawners (speleophils) although detailed information on their reproductive biology in the wild is limited. In the wild, the species is known to breed in holes excavated beneath aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. In captivity, artificial caves are readily accepted as breeding sites, however, these too are excavated prior to egg-laying.<ref name="wacichlids"/> The eggs are adhesive and are frequently laid in rows of ''ca.'' 10 on the upper surface of the cave and produce a clutch that ranges in size from 40-100.<ref name="wacichlids"/><ref name="martin"/> Both the male and female provide active brood care, typically lasting 21-28 days,<ref name="wacichlids"/> which includes guarding, herding and feeding. It is noteworthy, however, that the female is predominantly responsible for fry care, while the male is primarily involved in territorial defence.<ref name="martin"/>  As in all ''Pelvicachromis'' species, the gender ratio of female to male fry increases with ''p''H.<ref>Heiligenberg, W. (1965) Color polymorphism in the males of an African cichlid fish. ''Journal of Zoology'' '''146:''' 95-97.</ref><ref>Rubin, DA. (1985) Effect of pH on sex ratio in cichlids and a poeciliid (Teleostei). ''Copeia'' '''1:''' 233-235.</ref> This ratio is also is known to vary at different locales in the wild.<ref name="martin"/> Breeding pairs of ''P. pulcher'' have been known to adopt similarly aged fry from [[Conspecific|conspecifics]] in aquarium trials, and it has been suggested this may be an adaption to reduce predation on their own fry.<ref>Nelson CTJ, Elwood RW (1997) Parental state and offspring recognition in the biparental cichlid fish ''Pelvicachromis pulcher''. ''Animal Behaviour'' '''54:''' 803-809.</ref> Male colour polymorphism may be indicative of behavioural differences. For example, red males obtained from a single site were found to be more aggressive and more polygamous than yellow males obtained from the same site.<ref name="martin"/> In addition, the species has been demonstrated to engage in cooperative territorial defence where multiple males defend a single territory.<ref name="martin"/>

==Taxonomy==
''Pelvicachromis pulcher'' was originally described by [[George Albert Boulenger|George Boulenger]] in [[1901]], though subsequently a number of junior synonyms (''Pelmatochromis aureocephalus'', ''Pelmatochromis camerunensis'') and misidentifications (''Pelmatochromis kribensis'', ''Pelmatochromis subocellatus'' var. ''kribensis'' and  ''Pelmatochromis pulcher'' var. ''kribensis'') were brought into use. Some of these synonyms are still in use by aquarium hobbyists which complicates identification of this species.<ref name="fishbase"/><ref name="wacichlids"/> Many of the common and trade names used for this species, such as  [[kribensis]], krib, rainbow krib are derived from the erroneous binomial, ''Pelmatochromis kribensis''. 

==In the aquarium ==
''P. pulcher'' is a popular cichlid for the [[aquarium]].<ref name="Loiselle"/> The species should be housed in minimum volumes of 80-90 [[litres]] (21-25 [[gallons]]).<ref name="wacichlids"/> Fine gravel should be used as a [[substrate (aquarium)|substrate]], as the species likes to burrow and to excavate caves. [[Quartz|Quartzitic]] substrates should be avoided as they interfere with larval development and may cause fry mortality.<ref>Maradonna F, Bavestrello G, Cardinali M, Olivotto I, Cerrano C, Giovine M, Carnevali O. (2003) Role of substrate on larval development of the freshwater teleost ''Pelvicachromis pulcher''. ''Molecular Reproduction and Development'' '''66:''' 256-263.</ref> The aquarium should mimic the natural environment, and should be decorated with numerous caves, plants and hiding places.<ref name="baensch"/> [[Dither fish]] are useful in reducing the innate shyness of the species.<ref name="wacichlids"/> The species is an unfussy feeder and will accept a range of prepared foods.<ref name="baensch"/> They spawn readily in captivity and will accept artificial caves as substitutes for the holes used for spawning in the wild.<ref name="Loiselle">{{cite book |last=Loiselle |first=Paul V. |coauthors= |title=The Cichlid Aquarium |year=1995 |publisher=Tetra Press |location=Germany |isbn=1-56465-146-0}}</ref> Although tolerant of a range of water chemistries, the species has a preference for, and is more likely to breed when, maintained in soft, acidic water.<ref name="Nwadiaro"/> 

=== Selective breeding ===
An albino form of the species has been developed for the aquarium trade. Unlike normal [[albinism]], the trait is not [[recessive|recessively inherited]] in ''P. pulcher''.<ref name="Langhammer">Langhammer JK (1982) Albinism in ''Pelvicachromis pulcher''. ''Buntbarsche Bulletin '''93'''.</ref> The trait is [[Dominance_relationship#Incomplete_dominance|incompletely dominant]]. Like many albino animals red and yellow pigments are retained, however, albino ''P. pulcher'' also show patches of [[melanin]] in the dorsal and caudal fin around the ocelli.<ref name="Langhammer"/> Langhammer (1982) reports that matings from these albino forms with red and yellow pigments produce 25% wild coloured offspring and 75% albino fry. The albino fry were themselves divided into completely amelanistic forms, and forms which retained colouration of their parents.<ref name="Langhammer"/>
