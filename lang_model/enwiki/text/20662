The '''bat'leth''' is a curved ceremonial long-sword with handholds on the back.  It was created by ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' visual effects producer, [[Dan Curry]], for the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. It is mainly used within [[Star Trek canon|canon]] by the [[Klingon]]s, a race in the franchise. It is considered an iconic image of ''Star Trek'' and replicas are widely available online as collectibles and as a part of costuming; they have also been used in crimes.

==History==
A bat'leth consists of a curved blade with spiked protrusions at both ends and with handholds along the centre of the blade's back, and is approximately five feet long.<ref name=sun>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/49507/Star-Trek-blade-seized.html |title=Star Trek blade seized |newspaper=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |location=London |first=Mike |last=Sullivan}}</ref> The handholds are used to twist and spin the blade rapidly;<ref name=BBC /> the weapon can be used with either one or both hands.

== Canon ==
According to'' Star Trek'' canon, the Klingon [[Kahless]] created the first bat'leth around 625 A.D. Klingon mythology holds that he formed the blade by dropping a length of his hair into some lava from inside the Kri'stak Volcano, then cooling, shaping, and hardening it in the lake of Lursor.<ref name="Encyc" /> He then united Qo'noS, the Klingon homeworld, by killing a tyrant named Molor with the weapon, which became known as the "Sword of Kahless".<ref name="Encyc" /> The sword was later stolen by a species called the [[Hur'q]] during their invasion of Qo'noS.<ref name="Encyc" /> In the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode, "[[The Sword of Kahless]]", Worf and another Klingon named [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]] rediscovered the artifact, but it was eventually [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transported]] into space to prevent them from using it to attack each other.<ref name="DS9 ep">

== In popular culture ==
The bat'leth is considered to have become one of the iconic images of ''Star Trek''.<ref name=mov />
Replicas are widespread and are considered collectables by some and are sold from a number of outlets ranging from replica merchants<ref>{{cite news |last=Bragg |first=Mary Rae |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20344432.html |title=Surely, you joust |newspaper=Telegraph-Herald (archived at Highbeam) |location=Dubuque, Iowa |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2012-05-08 }}</ref> to weapons dealers to pawn shops.<ref name=gaz /> Among those who display one is [[Ronald D.

The rise in popularity of the bat'leth have also led to martial arts teams being founded to try to develop a distinct martial art, different from the one Curry initially developed, using the bat'leth. Such teams have incorporated moves from [[ju-jitsu]], [[kendo]], kinjitsu, and [[nunchuku]] martial arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapplean.net/batleth/whatis.html |title=WHAT IS the Vulcan Undiplomatic Corp? |publisher=Vulcan Undiplomatic Corp Bat'leth Martial Arts Team |date=2002 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref> Bat'leth competitions have also been held at conventions such as [[MileHiCon]] and [[StarCon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapplean.net/batleth/team.html |title=Want to join the VUC? |publisher=Vulcan Undiplomatic Corp Bat'leth Martial Arts Team |date= |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref>

Bat'leths have also appeared in television programmes outside the ''Star Trek'' franchise. In 2002, it was seen in "[[The Other Guys (Stargate SG-1)|The Other Guys]]" episode of the [[Canada|Canadian]] and American [[military science fiction]] programme ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0709195/trivia |title=The Other Guys (2002) - Trivia |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDB]] |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> In 2005, a bat'leth was in the background of the "[[Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra]]" episode of the American detective programme ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0650655/trivia|title=Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra (2005) - Trivia |publisher=IMDB |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> In 2010 a bat'leth was seen in the "[[Chuck Versus the Beard]]" episode of American comedy ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''.<ref name=mov /> In 2011, a bat'leth was used in the "The Zarnecki Incursion" episode of American [[sitcom|situation comedy]], ''[[The Big Bang Theory (TV series)|The Big Bang Theory]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632234/quotes|title=Memorable quotes for "The Big Bang Theory" The Zarnecki Incursion (2011) |publisher=IMDB |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref>

== Legality ==
Replicas of the bat'leth are often made of metal and can be considered dangerous. A [[stainless steel]] bat'leth was once said to be able to "literally, take someone's head off" by a police spokesman.<ref name=Mail /> However, bat'leths are also considered to be a kind of martial arts sword,<ref name=sun /> which could be seen to tie in to Dan Curry's work in martial arts in films. Media reports documenting instances of replica bat'leths being used in alleged crimes have referred to the weapon as a "double-pointed Klingon crescent-shaped sword",<ref name="7-11" /> a "Klingon-type sword",<ref name=7-11 /> a "Star Trek Klingon-type sword"<ref>{{cite news|last=Nicholson |first=Kieran |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_11631084 |title="Star Trek" sword boldly used in thefts |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> or as a "double-pointed scimitar".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/521585-man-holds-up-store-with-star-trek-weapon |title=Man holds up store with Star Trek weapon |newspaper=Metro |date=2009-02-05 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>
