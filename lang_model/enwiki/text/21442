The '''2008 Hungarian Grand Prix''' (formally the '''XXIII ING Magyar Nagyd<U+00ED>j''') was a [[Formula One]] motor race held on August 3, 2008, at the [[Hungaroring]] in [[Mogyor<U+00F3>d]], near [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. It was the 11th race of the [[2008 Formula One season]]. Contested over 70&nbsp;laps, the race was won by [[Heikki Kovalainen]] for the [[McLaren]] team, from a second position start. [[Timo Glock]] finished second in a [[Toyota F1|Toyota]] car, with [[Kimi R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen]] third in a [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. It was Kovalainen's first Formula One victory, which made him the sport's 100th driver to win a World Championship race, and it was Glock's first podium finish.

The majority of the race consisted of a duel between [[Lewis Hamilton]] and [[Felipe Massa]], who drove for McLaren and Ferrari, respectively. Hamilton started from [[pole position]] but was beaten at the first corner by Massa, who passed him around the outside. The two championship rivals began a battle for the lead that was resolved when Hamilton sustained a [[flat tire|punctured tyre]] just over halfway through the race, giving Massa a lead of more than 20&nbsp;seconds over Kovalainen. The Ferrari's engine, however, failed with three laps remaining, allowing the McLaren driver to win. R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen set the race's [[fastest lap]] in the other Ferrari, but was hampered by a poor qualifying performance and was stuck behind [[Fernando Alonso]] ([[Renault F1|Renault]]) and Glock in turn for almost all of the race.

As a consequence of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]] to five&nbsp;points over R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen, with Massa a further three behind. [[Robert Kubica]], who finished eighth after finding his [[BMW Sauber]] car uncompetitive at the Hungaroring, slipped to 13&nbsp;points behind Hamilton, ahead of teammate [[Nick Heidfeld]] and Kovalainen. In the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|World Constructors' Championship]], McLaren passed BMW Sauber for second&nbsp;position, 11&nbsp;points behind Ferrari.

===Background===
The Grand Prix was contested by 20&nbsp;drivers in ten teams of two.<ref name=pg200-201/> The teams, also known as "[[Formula One#Constructors|constructors]]", were [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]]-[[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]], [[Renault F1|Renault]], [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]], [[Force India]]-Ferrari, [[BMW Sauber]], [[Toyota F1|Toyota]], [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]]-Renault, [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-Toyota and [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]]-Ferrari.<ref name=pg200-201/> Before the race, Ferrari was in the lead of the [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]] with 105&nbsp;points, 16 ahead of BMW Sauber and a further three in front of McLaren.

In the week leading up to the race, a meeting between the teams at Ferrari's headquarters in [[Maranello]] resulted in the formation of a new representative body, the [[Formula One Teams Association]] (FOTA), which was led by Ferrari president [[Luca di Montezemolo]]. McLaren team principal [[Ron Dennis]] said the establishment of FOTA was intended to encourage greater co-operation between the teams, particularly in framing new sporting and technical regulations, and to act as a counterweight to the sport's existing governing body, the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) and the company responsible for its commercial management, [[Formula One Management]] (FOM).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Straw|first=Edd|date=2008-08-07|title=Pit & Paddock: Teams unite to create new power|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|pages=12<U+2013>13}}</ref>

On July 31, the day before the event's first free practice sessions took place, McLaren confirmed the team would retain Kovalainen for 2009 alongside Hamilton, while the organisers of the Hungarian Grand Prix signed a deal with [[Bernie Ecclestone]], the president of FOM, to continue hosting the race until 2016.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Straw|first=Edd|date=2008-08-07|title=Top Story: Kovalainen races on at McLaren|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|pages=6<U+2013>7}}</ref><ref name=IB2>{{cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Charles (ed.)|date=2008-08-07|title=Pit & Paddock: In Brief|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|page=13}}</ref>

Several teams made technical changes to their cars for the Grand Prix. Ferrari altered the [[Ferrari F2008|F2008]] chassis's cooling system and bodywork following high brake wear and engine water temperatures at the German Grand Prix. McLaren and Force India introduced revised [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] packages for their [[McLaren MP4-23|MP4-23]] and [[Force India VJM01|VJM01]] chassis, aimed at increasing the amount of [[downforce]], and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork.

The sport's sole tyre supplier, Bridgestone, provided two specifications of grooved dry tyres for the race, designated Soft (also referred to as the "prime" tyre) and Super Soft (also referred to as the "option" tyre). The Super Soft compound was distinguished by a white stripe in one of the tyre's grooves. As was the case for all of the 2008 Grands Prix, the rules stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre during the course of the race, and each driver was limited to seven sets of dry tyres for the weekend.<ref name=pg200-201/><ref name="sporting"/>

===Practice and qualifying===

Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race<U+2014>two on Friday from 10:00 to 11:30 and 14:00 to 15:30 local time, and a third on Saturday morning between 11:00 and 12:00.<ref name="sporting"/> The first practice session took place in dry conditions. The ambient temperature was between {{convert|27|-|28|C|F}}, and the track temperature ranged from {{convert|31|-|34|C|F}} during the hour-long period.<ref name=pg200-201/> Massa set the session's fastest time with a lap of 1&nbsp;minute and 20.981&nbsp;seconds, almost four-tenths of a second ahead of his teammate R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen. The two McLaren drivers were third and fourth, Kovalainen ahead of Hamilton. [[Fernando Alonso]] and [[Nelson Piquet, Jr.]] set the fifth and eighth-fastest times respectively for Renault; they were separated by Glock and Kubica. Their teammates, Heidfeld and Toyota driver [[Jarno Trulli]], completed the top ten.<ref name=pg200-201/> Vettel's Toro Rosso car was afflicted by a hydraulics problem;<ref name=TBT/> this restricted him to completing only four timed laps, and he was slowest overall.<ref name=pg200-201/>

The second practice session was held in similar weather to the first; the only difference was a slightly higher peak track temperature of {{convert|37|C|F}}.<ref name=pg200-201/> During this session, Hamilton set the quickest lap time of the day, a 1:20.554; Kovalainen finished with the third-fastest time.<ref name=pg200-201/> The Renault drivers were again quick<U+2014>Piquet in second and Alonso fourth<U+2014>although the team's Executive Director of Engineering, [[Pat Symonds]], admitted both cars were running with slightly lower fuel loads than normal, improving their performance.<ref name=TBT/> R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen and Massa slipped to fifth and sixth respectively, their best times one-thousandth of a second apart. They were ahead of Heidfeld, Kubica, Trulli and Williams driver [[Nico Rosberg]].<ref name=pg200-201/> Vettel's car was still suffering from the hydraulics problem and he completed just five laps, again setting the slowest time of the session.<ref name=pg200-201/><ref name=TBT/>

Saturday's weather was again dry for the third and final practice session, with ambient temperature between {{convert|27|-|29|C|F}} and track temperature from {{convert|32|-|36|C|F}}.<ref name=pg200-201/> Hamilton again set the fastest time, a 1:20.228, quicker than his best on Friday. This put him immediately ahead of Massa, Glock, Kovalainen and Piquet.<ref name=pg200-201/> Heidfeld was much happier with the [[Racing setup|setup]] of his car and set the sixth-fastest time, but Kubica suffered a mechanical problem that restricted him to 18th&nbsp;position.<ref name=TBT/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/8/8186.html|title=Final practice <U+2013> Massa heads the Hamilton chase|publisher=[[Formula One Administration]]|work=formula1.com|date=2008-08-02|accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref> Vettel had a trouble-free session and set the eighth-fastest time, one position behind teammate [[S<U+00E9>bastien Bourdais]].

Saturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three&nbsp;parts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted 15&nbsp;minutes, at the end of which the fastest 10 cars went into the final period to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race, but those competing in it were not and carried more fuel than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions to see them through the first part of the race.<ref name="sporting"/> The session was held in dry weather slightly hotter than any of the free practice sessions; the ambient temperature ranged between {{convert|30|and|31|C|F}}, while track temperature ranged between {{convert|38|and|41|C|F}}.<ref name=pg200-201/>

Hamilton set the fastest time in the first and final parts of the session, which clinched him [[pole position]] with a lap of 1:20.899.<ref name=pg200-201/> Although he was pleased with the handling of his McLaren<U+2014>he said that he had never been more comfortable in the car<U+2014>he believed that he could have recorded a faster lap, as he made a slight mistake going into Turn Five.<ref name=qualifying>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Hughes (journalist)|date=2008-08-07|title=F1 Report, Hungarian Grand Prix: Qualifying|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|page=41}}</ref> Hamilton was joined on the front row by his teammate Kovalainen, who recorded a lap time 0.241&nbsp;seconds slower and was fuelled for an additional two laps in the race.<ref name=pg194>{{cite book | chapter = Grands Prix 2008: Hungarian Grand Prix | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2008<U+2013>2009 | year = 2008 | publisher = Crash Media Group | isbn = 978-1905334-31-5 | page = 194}}</ref> Massa set the session's fastest time of 1:19.068 during its second part, but was delayed by other cars, which prevented him from heating his tyres sufficiently to achieve the maximum grip possible. He dropped to third overall in the final part of qualifying. R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen was on a heavier fuel load than his teammate but made a mistake on his final flying lap that restricted him to sixth&nbsp;place.<ref name=qualifying/> That left him behind Kubica and Glock on the grid. Kubica achieved his competitive time despite handling problems, which led him to describe his lap as his best so far of the season,<ref name=pg194/> while Glock recorded the best qualifying result of his career thus far.<ref name=qualifying/> Alonso qualified in seventh&nbsp;position with Piquet in tenth on a heavy fuel load; the Renault teammates were split by Webber and Trulli.<ref name=qualifying/> As the Soft tyres were expected to perform better in the race than the Super Softs, the McLaren drivers' use of one fewer set of the Soft tyres than their Ferrari counterparts during the qualifying session suggested Hamilton and Kovalainen might have had a tyre performance advantage in the race. This was because the Soft tyre was the fastest tyre choice over the course of a single lap, despite the theoretical performance advantage of the Super Soft; Ferrari used one more set of Soft tyres than McLaren before realising this was the case.<ref name=ASpg40>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Hughes (journalist)|date=2008-08-07|title=F1 Report, Hungarian Grand Prix: Felipe's Pain, Heikki's Gain|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|page=40}}</ref>

Vettel was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session, qualifying 11th; his best time of 1:20.131 was just over a second slower than Massa's pace in the second session.<ref name=pg200-201/> His teammate, Bourdais, set the 14th-fastest lap, but was penalised five positions on the grid for impeding Heidfeld during the first part of qualifying, a delay which limited the BMW Sauber driver to the 16th-fastest time.<ref name=TBT/> The Toro Rosso drivers were split before Bourdais' penalty by [[Jenson Button]]<U+2014>who found his Honda's revised suspension a significant improvement<U+2014>and [[David Coulthard]], who believed the Hungaroring did not suit the handling characteristics of his [[Red Bull RB4]] chassis.<ref name=TBT/><ref name=qualifying/> Rosberg made it into the second part of qualifying, but did not complete any laps thereafter after his Williams car developed a hydraulics problem.<ref name=qualifying/> [[Kazuki Nakajima]] (Williams), [[Rubens Barrichello]] (Honda) and Force India drivers [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] and [[Adrian Sutil]] failed to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and thus completed the final rows of the grid. In the first part of qualifying (the only section in which all drivers took part), the entire field was covered by just under three&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=pg200-201/>

===Race===
The race took place in the afternoon from 14:00 local time, in dry and sunny weather, with an ambient temperature of between {{convert|30|and|31|C|F}}, and a track temperature ranging from {{convert|40|to|43|C|F}}. The race-day attendance was 84,000.<ref name=official/> As usual, the race was broadcast worldwide, with the [[Formula One#Television|"World Feed"]] coverage being produced by FOM. Every driver except Coulthard started on the Soft compound tyres.<ref name=pg200-201/> Massa made a good start on his only remaining new set of Soft tyres, moving ahead of Kovalainen from the grid and drawing alongside Hamilton into the first corner. Hamilton held the inside line for the turn, but Massa braked later than the McLaren driver and passed him around the outside. Behind the leading three in the run down to the first corner, Glock moved ahead of Kubica, while Alonso overtook R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen.<ref name=ASpg40/> Barrichello made the best start in the field, moving from 17th to 13th&nbsp;place at the end of the first lap, while Vettel made a poor start and lost four places over the same distance. At the completion of the first&nbsp;lap, Massa led from Hamilton, Kovalainen, Glock, Kubica, Alonso, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen, Webber, Trulli, Piquet, Coulthard, Heidfeld, Barrichello, Button, Vettel, Bourdais, Rosberg, Nakajima, Fisichella and Sutil.<ref name=pg200-201/>

By lap&nbsp;18, Massa had a lead of 3.5&nbsp;seconds over Hamilton, who in turn was almost 8&nbsp;seconds ahead of Kovalainen. Glock was a further 3&nbsp;seconds behind the second McLaren driver, but was drawing ahead of Kubica in fifth, who was finding his BMW Sauber difficult to drive in race conditions with a lack of grip and stability under braking, and was holding up a group of cars behind him.<ref name=ASpg43>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Hughes (journalist)|date=2008-08-07|title=F1 Report, Hungarian Grand Prix: Felipe's Pain, Heikki's Gain|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|page=43}}</ref>

Massa, Kubica and Webber were the first three drivers to make pit stops by coming in on lap&nbsp;18.<ref name=pg200-201/> The McLaren mechanics timed Massa's stop to estimate the amount of fuel he received, and when Hamilton made his own first stop on the next lap, they fuelled him to run for three&nbsp;laps longer than the Ferrari in the second stint of the race.<ref name=pg195/> Kovalainen took over the lead of the race for two&nbsp;laps before his pit stop on lap&nbsp;21 returned it to Massa.<ref name=pg200-201/> Piquet was the last of the leading runners to make a pit stop, on lap&nbsp;25, allowing him to jump ahead of Kubica, Trulli and Webber.<ref name=ASpg43/> Further down the order, Vettel made an unscheduled pit stop on lap&nbsp;20 and retired two&nbsp;laps later with an overheating engine.<ref name=pg200-201/><ref name=TBT/> By the end of lap&nbsp;26, all of the leading drivers on two-stop strategies had taken their pit stops. The race order was Massa leading from Hamilton, Kovalainen, Glock, Coulthard (who was yet to pit), Alonso, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen, Piquet, Trulli, Kubica, Webber, Heidfeld, Button, Barrichello, Bourdais, Rosberg, Nakajima, Fisichella and Sutil.<ref name=pg200-201/>

Hamilton rejoined the race following his first pit stop 2.6&nbsp;seconds behind Massa, and needed to stay within approximately 3.5&nbsp;seconds of the Ferrari driver to gain track position after the second round of pit stops.<ref name=ASpg43/> Massa began to pull away again, easing the gap open to 4&nbsp;seconds by lap&nbsp;32, while Hamilton locked his front-left wheel as he tried to keep up with the Ferrari, [[List_of_motorsport_terminology#F|flat-spotting]] the tyre in the process. The two continued to set fastest laps as they pulled away from the rest of the field.<ref name=ASpg44>{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Hughes (journalist)|date=2008-08-07|title=F1 Report, Hungarian Grand Prix: Felipe's Pain, Heikki's Gain|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|page=44}}</ref> On lap&nbsp;29, Coulthard made his first pit stop, dropping to 12th&nbsp;place as a result. Button, Barrichello, Bourdais, Rosberg, Nakajima, Fisichella and Sutil also made their first pit stops at this stage of the race.<ref name=pg200-201/> Three of these drivers experienced delays during their pit stops which dropped them down the running order: Barrichello and Bourdais suffered flash fires, while Rosberg's fuel hose jammed, losing him time.<ref name=pg198>{{cite book | chapter = Grands Prix 2008: Hungarian Grand Prix | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2008<U+2013>2009 | year = 2008 | publisher = Crash Media Group | isbn = 978-1905334-31-5 | page = 198}}</ref>

At the front of the field, Massa continued to pull away gradually from Hamilton; the gap between the two had risen to 5&nbsp;seconds by the end of lap&nbsp;40. On the following lap, Hamilton's front-left tyre [[Flat tire|deflated]] approaching Turn Two; the resultant slow lap back to the pit lane and stop for a replacement tyre dropped him to tenth place.<ref name=pg195/> Massa now had a 23-second lead over Kovalainen and slowed his pace accordingly, adjusting the performance of the engine to place it under less mechanical stress.<ref name=ASpg44/> He made his final pit stop on lap&nbsp;44, allowing Kovalainen to take the lead until his own stop four laps later, handing Massa back his lead.<ref name=pg195/> On lap&nbsp;41, Heidfeld made his only pit stop, dropping from 11th to 12th position. In the following laps, the other drivers made their second stops, except Nakajima, who switched to a one-stop strategy at his first visit to his pit box.<ref name=pg200-201/><ref name=TBT/> Behind the leading trio of Massa, Kovalainen and Glock, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen moved ahead of Alonso despite running off the road just before his pit stop; after he exited the pit lane, Piquet fended off Trulli as they battled for position. The pit stop sequence allowed Hamilton to move back up the order, to sixth&nbsp;place behind Alonso.<ref name=ASpg44/> Further back, Bourdais suffered another flash fire on lap&nbsp;45, and made another visit to the pit lane one lap later to have [[fire extinguisher]] foam cleaned off his helmet visor.<ref name=pg198/> Rosberg was the final scheduled driver to make a pit stop, on lap&nbsp;58. The majority of the drivers ran with Soft tyres for the first two stints of the race, then switched to the Super Soft compound for the final stint.<ref name=pg200-201/>

At the conclusion of lap&nbsp;59, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the running order was Massa leading from Kovalainen, Glock, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen, Alonso, Hamilton, Piquet, Trulli, Kubica, Webber, Heidfeld, Coulthard, Button, Nakajima, Rosberg, Fisichella, Sutil, Barrichello and Bourdais.<ref name=pg200-201/> Running in [[List of motorsport terminology#C|clean air]] without a car immediately in front of him for the first time, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen set the fastest lap of the race at 1:21.195, on lap&nbsp;61, as he closed the nine-second gap to Glock at a rate of one second per lap. Hamilton caught Alonso at a similar rate, but his rear Super Soft tyres began to overheat and he was unable to make any further impression after closing the gap to 1.5&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=ASpg44/> On lap&nbsp;62, Sutil suffered a puncture caused by a brake failure and became the second retirement of the race.<ref name=TBT/> In the closing laps, Kovalainen reduced his deficit to Massa to 15&nbsp;seconds, but the Ferrari driver appeared to be in command of the race. However, as Massa started lap&nbsp;68, his engine failed without warning, forcing him to retire from the lead with three&nbsp;laps remaining.<ref name=ASpg44/> Kovalainen was thus promoted into the lead, which he held to take the first victory of his Formula One career in a time of 1'37:27.067, at an average speed of {{convert|117.309|mph|km/h}}. Kovalainen was the 100th driver to win a Formula One World Championship race.<ref name=pg200-201/> Glock likewise claimed the best result of his career, and first podium finish, with second&nbsp;position. R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen took the final place on the podium despite a failure in his car's rear suspension during the final few laps.<ref name=ASpg44/> Alonso and Piquet finished on either side of Hamilton, who was in fifth position, leading Symonds to describe the race as his team's best of the year so far.<ref name=pg197>{{cite book | chapter = Grands Prix 2008: Hungarian Grand Prix | last = Arron | first = Simon | title = [[Autocourse]] 2008<U+2013>2009 | year = 2008 | publisher = Crash Media Group | isbn = 978-1905334-31-5 | page = 197}}</ref> Trulli finished seventh, ahead of Kubica, who was extremely disappointed with the uncompetitive performance of his car at the Grand Prix closest to his home country of [[Poland]].<ref name=Offline>{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=Jonathan|date=2008-08-07|title=F1 Report, Hungarian Grand Prix: Offline|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|pages=44<U+2013>45}}</ref> His teammate, Heidfeld, finished in tenth place between the two Red Bull drivers, both of whom were also disappointed by their team's performance.<ref name=TBT/> Button, Nakajima, Rosberg and Fisichella filled the next places, a lap behind the leader, while Barrichello was two laps down in 16th&nbsp;position after the delay at his first pit stop.

===Post-race===

{{quote box|quote="There have been various incidents this year and we have been in the position after Saturday quite a few times to fight for the victory, but always something has gone wrong and it hasn't functioned perfectly. Today obviously I knew Massa and Lewis were both very fast at the beginning of the race but halfway through the race I felt it was starting to work for me a little bit better and then at the end I just tried to put pressure on Massa and hoped something would happen and obviously it looked like he had a mechanical failure, so it all worked fine for me today and I am very, very happy about it. All the hard work that the whole team has put in the last few months, through difficult times, we just kept pushing and it is very respectable and I am very, very glad to score my first victory."|source=[[Heikki Kovalainen]], speaking during the post-race FIA [[press conference]] for the podium finishers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kovalainen|first=Heikki|authorlink=Heikki Kovalainen|title=FIA post-race press conference <U+2013> Hungary|publisher=[[Formula One Administration]]|work=formula1.com|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/8/8200.html|date=2008-08-03|accessdate=2009-12-22}}</ref>|width=40%|align=right}}

Although Kovalainen was delighted with his first Formula One victory, he attributed much of the credit for his win to luck. After the race he said, "I feel a bit sorry for Felipe and Lewis. They both drove great races, but I know how it feels when things go wrong<U+2014>I've had a few similar moments this year. I tried to put pressure on Felipe, especially during the last stint. I felt something might happen if I did that, you never know, but I still found it hard to believe when I saw his Ferrari on fire."<ref name=pg197/> As of the end of the 2010 season, the race remains Kovalainen's only Formula One win.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heikki Kovalainen|publisher=[[Formula One Administration]]|work=formula1.com|url=http://www.formula1.com/teams_and_drivers/drivers/813/|year=2010|accessdate=2010-11-14}}</ref> Glock was pleased with second position and spoke of how he had dedicated extra training to improve his race starts. He said he had focussed on not making any mistakes in the closing laps as R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen closed, instead of maintaining the gap.<ref name=ASpg43/><ref name=pg197/> R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen described his race as "frustrating and boring" due to the amount of time he spent stuck behind slower cars.<ref>{{cite web|last=R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen|first=Kimi|authorlink=Kimi R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen|title=Hungarian Grand Prix <U+2013> selected driver quotes|publisher=[[Formula One Administration]]|work=formula1.com|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/8/8197.html|date=2008-08-03|accessdate=2009-12-22}}</ref>

The podium finishers were overshadowed in the media by coverage of the ill fortune of both the weekend's pace-setters, Hamilton and Massa.<ref name=pg197/> Massa in particular was praised for his performance. The Ferrari team principal, [[Stefano Domenicali]], said it was, "the best race of his career. It was fantastic the way he managed the race."<ref name=IB1>{{cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Charles (ed.)|date=2008-08-07|title=Pit & Paddock: In Brief|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=193|issue=6|page=11}}</ref> Journalist [[Mark Hughes (journalist)|Mark Hughes]] described it as "almost certainly his best race to date",<ref name=ASpg44/> and colleague Simon Arron termed it as "one of the finest afternoons of his F1 career".<ref name=pg197/> Both drew attention to his controlled aggression at the first corner of the race, followed by his relentless, mistake-free pace. Arron, in particular, noted that Massa's first-corner passing move was more typical of Hamilton's attacking style than his own, and was a "defining moment" in Massa's championship campaign.<ref name=pg195/> Hamilton himself later expressed surprise that Massa had been able to overtake him in such a manner, and warned his rival that "it won't happen again".<ref name=ev>{{cite book | chapter = Grands Prix 2008: Hungarian Grand Prix: Editor's View | last = Henry | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Henry | title = [[Autocourse]] 2008<U+2013>2009 | year = 2008 | publisher = Crash Media Group | isbn = 978-1905334-31-5 | page = 196}}</ref> Hughes described the Grand Prix as "a throwback race", in that the leaders had suffered from unreliability, and the winner had not been in contention on speed alone; It was a situation reminiscent of earlier times in the sport, when the cars were generally less reliable.<ref name=ASpg40/>

Bridgestone director of motorsport [[Hirohide Hamashima]] said Hamilton's puncture was probably caused by debris, although as a result of the damage the tyre had sustained, the precise nature of the failure was impossible to determine. He also stated that Hamilton's tyre was more vulnerable to sustaining debris damage because he had flat-spotted it earlier in the race.<ref name=ASpg44/> Massa said he had no prior indication of his engine failure.<ref name=pg197/> The problem was later traced to a [[connecting rod]] failure caused by an impurity in the component material. An identical problem caused R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen to retire from the following race, the [[2008 European Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Formula 1 Review: Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro | last = Hughes | first = Mark | authorlink = Mark Hughes (journalist) | title = [[Autocourse]] 2008<U+2013>2009 | year = 2008 | publisher = Crash Media Group | isbn = 978-1905334-31-5 | page = 56}}</ref>

As a consequence of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship to five&nbsp;points ahead of R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen, who moved ahead of Massa in the standings. Kubica maintained fourth place; Kovalainen's win moved him to within three points of Heidfeld in fifth. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari continued to lead, but McLaren jumped ahead of BMW Sauber for second position. Behind Toyota, Renault moved ahead of Red Bull.<ref name=pg200-201/> Despite his increased lead, Hamilton acknowledged that he expected the Ferrari drivers to be formidable opponents in the season's seven remaining races.<ref name=ev/> After the eventual conclusion of the championship in Hamilton's favour by one&nbsp;point, the Hungarian Grand Prix was highlighted as one of Massa's most obvious lost opportunities in his bid to win the title.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = Top Ten Drivers: 2 Felipe Massa | last = Henry | first = Alan | authorlink = Alan Henry | title = [[Autocourse]] 2008<U+2013>2009 | year = 2008 | publisher = Crash Media Group | isbn = 978-1905334-31-5 | page = 15}}</ref>
