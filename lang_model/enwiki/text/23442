The '''Paddington Waterside''' Partnership is the body coordinating regeneration of the Paddington Special Policy Area around [[Paddington Station]] in [[London]]. Covering an area the size of Soho, the scheme will see the addition of 3.6 million square feet of commercial space between 1998 and 2018. 

It consists of 13 individual projects in the triangle of land between [[Praed Street]], Westbourne Terrace and the A40 [[Westway (London)|Westway]], most notably PaddingtonCentral<!-- no space --> and [[Paddington Basin]]. The ''Independent'' has described it as "the largest central London redevelopment scheme since the Second World War".<ref>{{citation | title=Paddington project given green light | first=Saeed | last=Shah | date=18 October 2000 | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/paddington-project-given-green-light-635682.html }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:One-three-kingdom-street.jpg|thumb|One and Three Kingdom Street from the south.]]
The Paddington Arm of the [[Grand Junction Canal]] opened on 10 July 1801,<ref>{{citation | title=The Union magazine, and imperial register, Volume 2 | publisher =J. Walker | year=1801 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JWcAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67 | page=67}}</ref> linking Paddington to the Bull's Bridge junction near the future site of [[Heathrow Airport]]. The Grand Junction (now part of the [[Grand Union Canal]]) was the final link in a chain of canals that reduced the distance from London to Birmingham from {{convert|269.5|mi|km|0}} in 1789 to {{convert|138.5|mi|km|0}} in 1805;<ref>{{citation | title=Transport in the industrial revolution | first1=Derek Howard  | last1= Aldcroft | first2=Michael J. | last2=Freeman | publisher = Manchester University Press | year=1983 | isbn=9780719008399 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tX27AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA108 | page=108}}</ref> terminating the canal at Paddington gave easy access to main roads into London and the level route meant no [[lock (water transport)|locks]] were needed on its {{convert|13.5|mi|km|0|adj=on}} length. In contrast the [[Regent's Canal]] needed 12 locks for the {{convert|86|ft|m|adj=on}} descent from Paddington to the Thames at Limehouse.

The canal was an instant success, with warehouses and housing springing up around it.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Victoria history of the county of Middlesex | year=1911 | first=William | last=Page | volume=2 | publisher | =Constable | location=London | url=http://www.archive.org/details/middlesexhistory02univuoft | page=122}}</ref> Canal traffic increased further when the Regent's Canal linked Paddington to the [[Port of London]] in 1820, but Paddington Basin was "practically killed" as a port<ref>{{cite book | title=London's Coats of Arms and the Stories They Tell | first=Richard | last=Crosley | year=1928 | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-zqSQ9K1gN4C&pg=PA164 | page=164}}</ref> as business was lost to wharves such as [[City Road Basin]] that were closer to the docks and the [[City of London]]. Paddington regained importance as a transport interchange with the arrival of the railway in 1838. 

Canal traffic transferred to the railways during the nineteenth century and fell away completely after World War II; the closure of the [[Regent's Canal Dock]] in 1969 marked the [[coup de gr<U+00E2>ce]]. A similar switch from rail to road [[History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948<U+2013>1994|in the second half of the twentieth century]] left the Paddington goods yards redundant by the early 1980s. The land became derelict, with no public access to the canal land until 1987.<ref name=McGhie>{{cite newspaper | title=The new arrivals at Paddington | first=Caroline | last=McGhie | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/4814516/The-new-arrivals-at-Paddington.html | date=13 May 2001 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> The Paddington Special Policy Area was designated in 1988.<ref name=factsheet>{{cite web | title=Paddington Special Policy Area Factsheet | url=http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Paddington_Area_Factsheet_May_2009.pdf | publisher=Planning & City Development Department, City of Westminster | date=May 2009 | accessdate=29 October 2010 | format=pdf}}</ref> 

The '''Paddington Regeneration Partnership''', later the Paddington Waterside Partnership, was formed in 1998 to coordinate the regeneration of the area,<ref>{{cite web | title=Paddington Waterside Partnership | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-partnership/default.aspx | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | date=2008 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> now designated as the Paddington Special Policy Area.

The first plans for Paddington envisaged a greater square footage of space than the original [[Canary Wharf]] development,<ref name=McGhie /> in an area the size of Soho.<ref name=McGhie /> Outline planning permission for the western part of Paddington Basin was granted on 23 April 2001.<ref name=factsheet />

===PaddingtonCentral=== <!-- the developers put no space between Paddington and Central, although secondary sources often insert one -->
[[File:Paddington-central.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Kingdom Street from the north]]
Bishop's Bridge station, the original London passenger terminus of the [[Great Western Railway]] was on this site west of [[Bishop's Bridge]] Road. After Paddington was built, it was used for the railway's [[goods shed]]s until the 1980s. It is now a mixed-use development, with offices, flats and retail units. Phase I is Sheldon Square which is named after Sir Joseph Sheldon, a Lord Mayor of London who in 1678 rebuilt what became the church of [[List_of_churches_in_the_Diocese_of_London#Deanery_of_Westminster_Paddington|St Mary's]] on Paddington Green.<ref>{{citation | editor=C R Elrington |first1=T F T | last1=Baker | first2=Diane K | last2=Bolton | first3=Patricia E C |last3=Croot | year=1989 | pages=252-259 | title=Paddington: Churches | series=A History of the County of Middlesex, Hampstead, Paddington | volume=9 | accessdate=18 October 2010 | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22674}}</ref> Sheldon Square has 630,000 sq ft of built space<ref name=PaddingtonCentral>{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddingtoncentral/default.aspx | title=PaddingtonCentral | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref> built around a grass [[amphitheatre]] which features live music in summer.

===Paddington Basin and Merchant Square===
[[File:PaddBasin.jpg|thumb|Paddington Basin]]
{{main|Paddington Basin}}
Most of the land north of the canal basin is being developed under the banner of [[Paddington Basin]] by European Land and Property, a development company owned jointly by European Land Holdings Ltd and the [[Reuben brothers]]' Aldersgate Investments Ltd. It will create 2 million sq ft of offices, homes, shops and leisure facilities,<ref name=Basin>{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/paddington-basin/default.aspx | title=Paddington Basin / Merchant Square | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> with the western end being developed first.

St Mary's is a major teaching hospital with a long tradition of biomedical research, from the first synthesis of [[heroin]] to the discovery of [[penicillin]]. It is housed in buildings dating back to 1845 between Praed Street and Paddington Basin. In October 2000, the London Regional Office of the NHS approved a plan for a Paddington Health Campus that would replace three run-down hospitals - St Marys, the [[Royal Brompton Hospital|Royal Brompton]] and [[Harefield Hospital|Harefield]].<ref name=nao>{{cite web | title=Department of Health - The Paddington Health Campus scheme | url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0506/department_of_health_-_the_pad.aspx | publisher=National Audit Office | date= 2006-05-19 | accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> The initial cost was estimated at <U+00A3>411m at 2005 prices with completion in 2006,<ref name=nao /> to be financed by [[private finance initiative|PFI]],<ref name=bbc>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4994254.stm | title='Super-hospital' failure slammed | publisher=BBC News | date=2006-05-19 | Accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> but it became apparent that the scheme was too big for the original St Mary's site.<ref name=nao /> Various locations north of the canal basin were investigated but the scheme was finally abandoned in May 2005 after costs had spiralled to <U+00A3>894m and the completion date put back to 2013.<ref name=nao /> <U+00A3>15m was spent on the project, leading [[Richard Bacon (politician)|a member]] of the Commons [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] to describe it as "an object lesson in how not to build hospitals....a shambles of the first order",<ref name=bbc /> and [[Steve Webb|a colleague]] called it "incompetence on a massive scale".<ref name=bbc /> 

The land north of the canal that had been earmarked for the Health Campus became the Merchant Square development in Paddington Basin (see above).<ref name=merchant/>  The planning application was formally withdrawn in May 2008<ref name=factsheet /> but St Mary's remains part of the Paddington Waterside Partnership.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.paddingtonwaterside.co.uk/the-developments/st-marys-hospital/default.aspx | title=St Mary's Hospital/Imperial College | publisher=Paddington Waterside Partnership | accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> The only recent development work has been a <U+00A3>15m upgrade of the QEQM Wing.<ref name=factsheet />
