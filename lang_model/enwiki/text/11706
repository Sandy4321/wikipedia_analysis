The '''Kingdom of Belgium''' is a country in [[Western Europe|northwest Europe]] bordered by [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[France]], and is one of the founding and core members of the [[European Union]]. Belgium has a population of over ten-and-a-half million people, in an area of around 30,000 [[square kilometre]]s (11,700&nbsp;square miles).

Straddling the cultural boundary between [[Germanic Europe|Germanic]] and [[Latin Europe]], Belgium is linguistically divided. In the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking northern region [[Flemish region|Flanders]] lives 58% of the population. Another 10% inhabits the officially bilingual [[Brussels-Capital Region]], for approximately 85% using [[French language|French]].<ref name=ericcorijn>Flemish Academic Eric Corijn (initiator of [[Charta 91]]), at a colloquium regarding Brussels, on 5 December 2001, states that in Brussels there is 91% of the population speaking French at home, either alone or with another language, and there is about 20% speaking Dutch at home, either alone (9%) or with French (11%) - After ponderation, the repartition can be estimated at between 85 and 90% French-speaking, and the remaining are Dutch-speaking, corresponding to the estimations based on languages chosen in Brussels by citizens for their official documents (ID, driving licenses, weddings, birth, death, and so on) ; all these statistics on language are also available at Belgian Department of Justice (for weddings, birth, death), Department of Transport (for Driving licenses), Department of Interior (for IDs), because there are no means to know ''precisely'' the proportions since Belgium has abolished 'official' linguistic censuses, thus official documents on language choices can only be estimations.</ref><ref name=britishcouncil>

Belgium derives its name from the [[Latin]] name of the northernmost part of [[Gaul]], ''[[Gallia Belgica]]'', named after a group of mostly [[Celt]]ic tribes, ''[[Belgae]]''. Historically, Belgium has been a part of the [[Low Countries]], which also include the Netherlands and Luxembourg and used to cover a somewhat larger region than the current [[Benelux]] group of states. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the seventeenth century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the sixteenth century until the Belgian revolution in 1830, the area at that time called the [[Southern Netherlands]], was the site of many battles between the European powers, and has been dubbed "the battlefield of Europe"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.be/en/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=49019|title=Belgian economy|publisher=Belgian federal ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation}}</ref> or "the cockpit of Europe".<ref>[[Nuttall encyclopedia]]</ref> More recently, Belgium was a founding member of the [[European Union]], hosting its headquarters, as well as those of many other major [[international organization]]s, such as [[NATO]].

==History==
{{main|History of Belgium}}
Over the past two millennia, the area that is now known as Belgium has seen significant demographic, political and cultural upheavals. The first well-documented population move was the conquest of the region by the [[Roman Republic]] in the first century [[Anno Domini|BC]], followed in the fifth century by the [[Germanic people|Germanic]] [[Franks]]. The Franks established the [[Merovingian]] kingdom, which became the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the eighth century. During the Middle Ages the Low Countries were split into many small [[feudal]] states. Most of them were united in the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries by the house of [[Burgundy]] as the [[Burgundian Netherlands]]. These states gained a degree of autonomy in the fifteenth century and were thereafter named the [[Seventeen Provinces]].

[[Image:Map-1477 Low Countries.png|300px|thumb|left|The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (orange, brown and yellow areas) and the [[Bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge]] (green area). For a detailed description, see [[Seventeen Provinces]].]]
The history of Belgium can be distinguished from that of the Low Countries from the sixteenth century. The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568&ndash;1648), divided the Seventeen Provinces into the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands|United Provinces]] in the north and the [[Southern Netherlands]] in the south. The southern provinces were ruled successively by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[History of Austria#Charles VI and Maria Theresa (1711-1780)|Austrian]] [[Habsburg]]s. Until independence, the Southern Netherlands were sought after by numerous French conquerors and were the theatre of most [[Early Modern France#France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries|Franco-Spanish and Franco-Austrian wars]] during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Following the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries<U+2014>including territories that were never under Habsburg rule, such as the [[Bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge]]<U+2014>were overrun by France, ending Spanish-Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] occurred at the end of the [[first French Empire|French Empire]] in 1815. 

The 1830 [[Belgian Revolution]] led to the establishment of an 
[[independence|independent]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and neutral Belgium under a [[Provisional Government of Belgium |provisional government]] and a [[national Congress of Belgium|national congress]]. Since the installation of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]] as king in 1831, Belgium has been a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]]. Between independence and [[World War II]], the democratic system evolved from an [[oligarchy]] characterised by two main parties, the Catholics and the Liberals, to a [[universal suffrage]] system that has included a third party, the Labour Party, and a strong role for the [[trade union]]s. Originally, French, which was the adopted language of the [[nobility]] and the [[bourgeoisie]], was the official language. The country has since developed a bilingual Dutch-French system, but only in 1967 an official Dutch version of the [[Belgian Constitution|Constitution]] was accepted<ref>[http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:B_qKhqKrm-gJ:www.unrisd.org/UNRISD/website/document.nsf/ab82a6805797760f80256b4f005da1ab/ec506a59176be044c1256e9e003077c3/%24FILE/Deschou.pdf+when+was+the+belgian+constitution+translated+into+dutch%3F+1967&hl=nl&ct=clnk&cd=2&client=safari#23] Ethnic structure, inequality and governance of the public sector in Belgium, Kris Deschouwer, VUB, January 2004</ref>. 

[[Image:Wappers belgian revolution.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''Episode of the Belgian Revolution of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers]] (1834), in the Ancient Art Museum, Brussels.]]
The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 agreed to hand over [[Colonisation of the Congo|Congo]] to [[L<U+00E9>opold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] as his private possession, called the [[Congo Free State]]. In 1908, it was ceded to Belgium as a colony, henceforth called the [[Belgian Congo]]. Belgium's neutrality was violated in 1914, when Germany invaded Belgium as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. The former [[German colonies]] [[Ruanda-Urundi]]<U+2014>now called [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]<U+2014>were occupied by the Belgian Congo in 1916. They were mandated in 1924 to Belgium by the [[League of Nations]]. Belgium was again invaded by Germany in [[1940]] during the [[blitzkrieg]] offensive. The country was occupied until the winter of 1944-45 when it was liberated by Allied troops. The Belgian Congo gained its independence in [[1960]] during the [[Congo Crisis]], and Ruanda-Urundi became independent in 1962.

After [[World War II]], Belgium joined [[NATO]] and, together with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, formed the [[Benelux]] group of nations. Belgium is also one of the six founding members of the 1951 established [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and the 1957 established [[European Economic Community]] and [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. Belgium hosts the headquarters of NATO and a major part of the [[European Union]]'s institutions and administrations, including the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]] and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the [[European Parliament]], as well as parts of its administration. 

During the twentieth century, and in particular since World War II, the history of Belgium has been increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main communities. This period saw a rise in intercommunal tensions, and the unity of the Belgian state has come under scrutiny.<ref name=bbcnews/> Through constitutional reforms in the 1970s and 1980s, [[regionalisation]] of the unitary state had led to the establishment of a three-tiered system of [[federalism]], linguistic-community and regional governments, a compromise designed to minimise linguistic tensions. Nowadays, these federal entities uphold more legislative power than the national bicameral parliament, whereas national government still controls nearly all taxation, over 80% of the finances of the community and region governments, and 100% of the social security.

==Government and politics==
[[Image:Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Guy Verhofstadt]], Prime Minister since July 1999.]]
{{main|Politics of Belgium}}
Belgium is a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] [[popular monarchy]] and [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] that evolved after World War II from a [[unitary state]] to a [[federation]]. The [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]] is composed of a [[Senate]] and a [[Chamber of Representatives]]. The former is a mix of directly elected senior politicians and representatives of the communities and regions; while the latter represents all Belgians over the age of eighteen in a [[proportional voting]] system. Belgium is one of the few countries that has [[compulsory voting]], thus having one of the highest rates of [[voter turnout]] in the world.<ref>[[Voter turnout|Election turnout]] in national lower house elections from 1960 to 1995, numbers from Mark N. Franklin's "Electoral Participation".</ref>

The federal government, formally nominated by the king, must have the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives. It is led by the [[Prime Minister]]. The numbers of Dutch- and French-speaking ministers are equal as prescribed by the Constitution.<ref>[http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0006.htm#E11E6 Constitution of Belgium] Art. 99</ref> The King is the [[head of state]], though with limited [[Royal Prerogative|prerogatives]].<ref>[http://www.servat.unibe.ch/law/icl/be00000_.html] Title IX Succession, Transition, Part I "Rules of Succession": "The constitutional powers of the King are hereditary through the direct, natural, and legitimate descent from H.M. Leopold, George, Chretien, Frederic of Saxony-Coburg, from male to male, by order of primogeniture and with the permanent exclusion of women and of their descendants."</ref> Actual power is vested in the Prime Minister and the [[list of Governments in Belgium|different governments]], who govern the country. The judicial system is based on [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and originates from the [[Napoleonic code]]. The [[Court of Appeals|Court of Appeal]] is one level below the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]].

Belgium's political institutions are complex; most political power is organized around the need to represent the main language communities. Since around 1970, the significant national Belgian [[political party|political parties]] have split into distinct components that mainly represent the interests of these communities (that is to say along political as well as linguistic fronts). The major parties in each community, though close to the [[centrism|political centre]], belong to three main political families: the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Liberals]], the [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] [[Christian Democracy|Christian Democrats]], and the [[Democratic Socialism|Socialists]] as [[left-wing politics|left-wing]]. Other important younger parties are the [[worldwide green parties|Green party]] and <U+2014>nowadays mainly in Flanders<U+2014> [[nationalism|nationalist]] parties, in particular the [[far-right]] [[Vlaams Belang]]. Politics is influenced by lobby groups, such as [[trade union]]s and business interests in the form of the [[Trade Federation of Enterprises in Belgium]].

<!--Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Koning Albert II van Belgi<U+00EB>.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]], King of the Belgians]]-->
The current king, [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]], succeeded King [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]] in 1993. Since 1999, Prime Minister [[Guy Verhofstadt]] from the [[Flemish Liberals and Democrats|VLD]] has led a six-party Liberal-Social Democrat-Greens [[coalition]], often referred to as 'the rainbow government'. This was the first government without the Christian Democrats since 1958.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/392004.stm Belgium's "rainbow" coalition sworn in, BBC News, 12 July, 1999]</ref> In the [[Belgian general election, 2003|2003 elections]], Verhofstadt won a second term in office and has led a Liberal-Social Democrat coalition of four parties.<ref>[http://www.lachambre.be/kvvcr/pdf_sections/pri/fiche/10F.pdf Composition of the Chamber of Representatives, on the official homepage of the Chamber, in French]</ref> In recent years, there has also been a steady rise of the Flemish far right nationalist [[separatism|separatist]] party [[Flemish Block|Vlaams Blok]], meanwhile superseded by [[Vlaams Belang]] amidst allegations of racism promoted by the party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3994867.stm Court rules Vlaams Blok is racist, BBC News, 9 November, 2004]</ref> 

A significant achievement of the two successive Verhofstadt governments has been the achievement of a balanced budget; Belgium is one of the few member-states of the EU to have done so. This policy was applied by the successive governments during the 1990s under pressure from the [[European Council]]. The fall of the previous government was mainly because of the [[dioxin]] crisis,<ref>[http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/jun1999/belg-j08.shtml Dioxin contamination scandal hits Belgium: Effects spread through European Union and beyond, World Socialist Web Site, 8 June, 1999]</ref> a major food intoxication scandal in 1999 that led to the establishment of the Belgian Food Agency.<ref>[http://www.favv-afsca.fgov.be/portal/page?_pageid=34,66751&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL History of the Federal Food Agency, at its official homepage]</ref> This event resulted in an atypically large representation by the Greens in parliament, and a greater emphasis on environmental politics during the first Verhofstadt government. One Green policy, for example, resulted in [[Nuclear power phase-out#Belgium|nuclear phase-out]] legislation, which has been modified by the current government. The absence of Christian Democrats from the ranks of the government has enabled Verhofstadt to tackle social issues from a more [[Liberalism|liberal]] point of view and to develop new legislation on the use of [[soft drug]]s, [[same-sex marriage in Belgium|same-sex marriage]] and [[euthanasia#Belgium|euthanasia]]. During the two most recent parliaments, the government has promoted active diplomacy in Africa,<ref>[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0019846.html The Rwanda article at Tiscali.References] shows an example of Belgium's recent African policies.</ref> opposed a military intervention during the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], and has passed legislation concerning [[War Crimes Law (Belgium)|war crimes]]. Both of Verhofstadt's terms have been marked by disputes between the Belgian communities. The major points of contention are the nocturnal air traffic routes at [[Brussels Airport]] and the status of the electoral district of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]].

The country's [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]] was revised on [[14 July]] [[1993]] to create a unique federal state, based on three levels:
#The federal [[government]], based in Brussels.
#The three language communities:
#* the [[Flemish Community|Flemish (i.e., Dutch-speaking) Community]];
#* the [[French Community of Belgium|French (i.e., French-speaking) Community]];
#* the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]].
# The three regions (which differ from the language communities with respect to the German-speaking community and the Brussels region):
#* the [[Flemish Region]];
#* the [[Walloon Region]]; and
#* the [[Brussels-Capital Region]].
Conflicts between the bodies are resolved by the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium]]. The setup allows a compromise so distinctly different cultures can live together peacefully.

The Flemish Community absorbed the Flemish Region in 1980 to form the government of [[Flanders]].<ref>[http://www.flanders.be/ The official homepage of Flanders (Community and Region)]</ref> The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region is included in both Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Flemish and Walloon regions are furthermore subdivided in administrative entities, the [[provinces of Belgium|provinces]]. 

At the highest level of this three-tiered setup is the [[Belgian federal government|federal government]] which manages [[foreign affairs]], [[development aid]], [[defense (military)|defence]], [[Belgium/Military|military]], police, economic management, [[social welfare]], [[social security]] transport, energy, telecommunications, and scientific research, limited competencies in education and culture, and the supervision of taxation by regional authorities. The federal government controls more than 90 percent of all taxation. The community governments are responsible for the promotion of language, culture and education in mostly schools, libraries and theatres. The third tier is the Regional governments, who manage mostly land and property based issues such as housing, transportation etc. For example, the building permit for a school building in Brussels belonging to the public school system would be regulated by the regional government of Brussels. However, the school as an institution would fall under the regulations of the Flemish government if the primary language of teaching is Dutch, but under the French Community government if the primary language is French.

{{main|Geography of Belgium}}
Belgium, with a land area of 30&nbsp;528 [[square kilometre]]s (33,990&nbsp;km<U+00B2> in total), has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west, the central plateau, and the [[Ardennes]] uplands in the south-east. The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and [[polder]]s. Polders are areas of land, close to or below sea level that have been reclaimed from the sea, from which they are protected by [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] or, further inland, by fields that have been drained with canals. The second geographical region, the central plateau, lies further inland. This is a smooth, slowly rising area that has many fertile valleys and is irrigated by many waterways. Here one can also find rougher land, including caves and small [[gorge]]s. Belgium shares borders with [[France]] 620&nbsp;km, [[Germany]] 167&nbsp;km, [[Luxembourg]] 148&nbsp;km and [[Netherlands]] 450&nbsp;km.

[[Image:Hautes-Fagnes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[High Fens]] in the Ardennes.]]
The third geographical region, called the Ardennes, is more rugged than the first two. It is a thickly forested plateau, very rocky and not very good for farming, which extends into northern France and in Germany where it is named [[Eifel]]. This is where much of Belgium's wildlife can be found. Belgium's highest point, the [[Signal de Botrange]], is located in this region at only 694&nbsp;[[metre]]s (2,277&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length|ft]]).

The climate is maritime [[temperate]], with significant precipitation in all seasons ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb''; the average temperature is 3&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (37&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) in January, and 18<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Celsius|C]] (64&nbsp;<U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) in July; the average precipitation is 65&nbsp;[[millimetre]]s (2.6&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in January, and 78&nbsp;millimetres (3.1&nbsp;in) in July).<ref>[http://www.eurometeo.com/english/climate/city_EBBR/id_GT/meteo_brussels_belgium Eurometeo: The meteo at Brussels]</ref> This century's year round average daily minimum temperature is 7&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (45&nbsp;<U+00B0>F), maximum at 14&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (57&nbsp;<U+00B0>F); average monthly rainfall is 65&nbsp;[[millimetre]]s (2.6&nbsp;[[inch|in]]).<ref name=statbel2>

Because of its high population density, location in the centre of Western Europe and too little political effort, Belgium faces serious [[Environment of Belgium|environmental problems]]. A 2003 report<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn3458 |title=Sewage-laden Belgian water worst in world |date=[[2003-03-05]] |accessdate=2006-05-09 |last=Pearce |first=Fred |publisher=New Scientist}}</ref> suggested that the water in Belgium's rivers was of the lowest quality in Europe, and bottom of the 122 countries studied.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Belgium}}
Densely populated, Belgium is located at the heart of one of the world's most highly industrialised regions. Currently, the Belgium economy is heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature with a dynamic [[Flanders|Flemish]] part and [[Brussels]] as its main multilingual and multi-ethnic centre and a GNP/person which is one of the highest in the [[European Union]], and a [[Wallonia|Walloon]] economy that lags roughly one quarter behind (in GNP/person).

Belgium was the first continental European country to undergo the [[Industrial Revolution]], in the early 1800s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.erih.net/index.php?pageId=114 |publisher=European Route of Industrial Heritage |title=Industrial History Belgium |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> [[Li<U+00E8>ge (city)|Li<U+00E8>ge]] and [[Charleroi]] rapidly developed mining and steelmaking, which flourished until the mid-20th century. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and there was famine in Flanders (1846&ndash;50). After World War II, [[Ghent]] and [[Antwerp]] experienced a fast expansion of the [[chemical]] and [[petroleum]] industries. The [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979 oil crises]] sent the economy into a prolonged recession. The Belgian steel industry has since experienced serious decline. This has been responsible for inhibiting the economic development of [[Walloon Region|Wallonia]].<ref name="state.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2874.htm |title=Background Note: Belgium |publisher=[[US Department of State]] |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> In the 1980s and 90s, the economic centre of the country continued to shift northwards to Flanders. Today, industry is concentrated in the populous Flemish area in the north. 

By the end of the 1980s, Belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120% of [[GDP]]. Currently, budget is in balance and public debt is equal to 90.30% of GDP (2006).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2186rank.html |title=The World Factbook - (Rank Order - Public debt) |accessdate=2007-05-08 |date=2007-04-17}}</ref> In 2005 and 2006 the real growth rate of GDP was estimated at 1.5% and 3.0% respectively, both slightly above the average for the euro area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbb.be/pub/00_00_00_00_02/?l=en&t=ho |title=KEY FIGURES |publisher=[[National Bank of Belgium]]}}</ref> 

Belgium has a particularly [[open economy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diplomatie.be/EN/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=49019 |title=Belgian Economy |publisher= diplomatie.be (Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation) |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> It has developed an excellent [[transportation in Belgium|transportation infrastructure]] of ports, canals, [[Rail transport in Belgium|railways]] and roads to integrate its industry with that of its neighbours. The [[Port of Antwerp]] is the second-largest European port and [[Port of Zeebrugge|Zeebrugge]], the modern port of [[Bruges]], is an important European port as well. One of the founding members of the European Union, Belgium strongly supports the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate the member economies. In 1999, Belgium adopted the [[euro]], the single European currency, which replaced the [[Belgian franc]] in 2002. The Belgian economy is strongly oriented towards foreign trade, in particular of high value-added goods. The main imports are food products, machinery, rough diamonds, petroleum and petroleum products, chemicals, clothing and accessories, and textiles. The main exports are automobiles, food and food products, iron and steel, finished diamonds, textiles, plastics, petroleum products, and nonferrous metals. Since 1922, Belgium and [[Luxembourg]] have been a single trade market within a [[customs union|customs]] and [[currency union]]<U+2014>the [[Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union]]. Its main trading partners are Germany, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the United States and Spain. Belgium ranks thirteenth on the 2006 [[United Nations]] [[Human Development Index]].

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Belgium}}
The [[population density]] (342 per&nbsp;km<U+00B2> or 886 per sq.&nbsp;mi) of Belgium is one of the highest in Europe, after that of the Netherlands and some microstates such as [[Monaco]]. The areas with the highest population density are the [[Flemish Diamond]] outlined by the [[Antwerp]]-[[Leuven]]-Brussels-[[Ghent]] agglomerations, as well as other important urban centres as [[Li<U+00E8>ge]], [[Charleroi]], [[Mons]], [[Kortrijk]], [[Bruges]], [[Hasselt]] and [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. The Ardennes have the lowest density. As of 2006, the Flemish Region has a population of about 6,078,600, Wallonia 3,413,978 and Brussels 1,018,804.<ref name=statbel1/><ref name=statbel3>[http://statbel.fgov.be/ Official statistics of Belgium]</ref><ref>[http://statistiques.wallonie.be/dyn/14/article1.ihtml?ID_SITE=14&ID_CATEGORIE=159&ID_ARTICLE=91&NOM_CATEGORIE=0BACA&CAT=1&MODE=MAIN]</ref> Almost all of the population is urban (97.3% in 1999).<ref>[http://www.undp.org/hdr2001/indicator/cty_f_BEL.html United Nation Development Programme]</ref> Statistics of 1991 indicate for Flanders and Wallonia, two out of three inhabitants to be proprietors of their dwelling, in the Brussels-Capital Region 40%.<ref name=statbel4>

Since independence, Catholicism, counterbalanced by strong [[freethought]] movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics. The ''[[laicite|laicist]]'' [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]] provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. Nevertheless, symbolically and materially the [[Roman Catholic Church]] stays in a favourable position, and the concept of 'recognized religion' caused a tedious path for [[Islam]] to become at the level of [[Jewish]] and [[Protestant|Protestant]] religions, other minority religions such as [[Buddhism]] do not yet have such status.<ref name=oldenburg>
