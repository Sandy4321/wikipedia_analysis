== Performers ==

In June 2006, in an interview on the Australian radio station [[Triple J]], [[Jesse F. Keeler]], the former bassist from [[Death from Above 1979]], revealed that he would be playing bass on an upcoming Queens of the Stone Age album, but said that he would more than likely not be touring with the band due to his desire to spend more time with his girlfriend.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.abc.ne.au/triplej/mel/listen/mp3s/dfa.mp3 | publisher=[[Triple J]] | title=''Mel in the Morning'' interview with Jesse Keeler (mp3) | date=[[2006-06-22]] | accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref> Eventually on the DFA internet forum, Keeler revealed that due to conflicting schedules he would not be appearing on the album. In February 2007, several sites reported that the album will include many guest vocalists, including [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Julian Casablancas]] from [[The Strokes]],  [[Mark Lanegan]], [[Billy Gibbons]] of [[ZZTop]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.spin.com/features/news/2007/02/070223_qotsa/  | publisher=[[Spin.com]] | title=Casablancas, Reznor Rumored Guests on QOTSA Album | author=Spin.com | date=[[2007-02-23]] | accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> and deceased humourist [[Erma Bombeck]].<ref name="ultimate-guitar">[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/video_news/queens_of_the_stone_age_will_not_settle_down_except_for_fans.html ''Queens Of The Stone Age Will Not Settle Down, Except For Fans'', Ultimate-guitar.com]</ref>

== Pre-Release Promotion ==

9 days after the album's announcement, a video was posted on the bands official website showing three of the band members [[jam session|jamming]].<ref>[http://www.rekordsrekords.com/qotsa/videos/Q2.1.mov First released jamming video]</ref> The last 6-7 seconds of the video contains footage (with audio) of the recording of '3s and 7s'.<ref name="billboard"/>

Another video surfaced of the recording of the new album emerged on the 5th of March. It again provided a glimpse of a possible new song from ''Era Vulgaris'' - the video was tagged "turning on the screw" in a possible allusion to the track title.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bWzvlFyS_Y 'Queens Of The Stone Age Creating Era Vulgaris', Youtube.com]</ref>

== Reception ==

Privy to a nine-track pre-release hearing of the album, [[NME|NME.com]] described the album as follows:

{{cquote|a step further into Pagan psychedelia, tighter and leaner than ''[[Lullabies To Paralyze|Lullabies to Paralyse]]'' while going yet further into Hansel and Gretelish strangeness.<br><small> NME.com, ''Dawn of the Era Vulgaris'' 15th March 2007<ref name="nme">[http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=11&p=327&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1#more327 ''Dawn of the Era Vulgaris'', NME.com March 15 2007]</ref>}}

After the hearing, Billboard.com opined that the songs "Sick, Sick, Sick," "Battery Acid," "3's + 7's" featured "fast, powerful riffs", while "Suture Up Your Future" and "I'm Designer" featured "more psychedelic, boogie-ish rhythms".<ref name="billboard"/>
