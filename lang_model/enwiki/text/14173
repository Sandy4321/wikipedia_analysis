The '''second series of the British crime drama ''[[Broadchurch]]''''' began airing on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast network in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2015. The eight-episode series focused on the continuing fallout of the murder of 11-year-old Danny Latimer in the fictional, close-knit coastal town of Broadchurch in [[Dorset]], [[United Kingdom]]. The series focused on the effect of Joe Miller's trial on his wife, [[Police ranks of the United Kingdom#Detectives|DS]] Ellie Miller; the Latimer family's struggle to achieve a normal life; and the impact new revelations have on the town.

Although ''Broadchurch'' was conceived as a trilogy, the second series was only announced on 22 April 2013 as series one ended. Writing occurred over most of the following year, with series creator and lead writer [[Chris Chibnall]] using a plot-development process he used for the first series. The return of series stars [[Olivia Colman]] and [[David Tennant]] and some of their returning co-stars was reported by the media in the fall of 2013, although both returning and new cast members were not formally announced by ITV until May 2014.

Filming on ''Broadchurch'' series two began in late May 2014, under the supervision of four directors. Extensive efforts were undertaken to keep the plot secret from the cast, crew, and public. Extensive location shooting occurred along the United Kingdom's [[Jurassic Coast]] and in [[South West England]]. [[Iceland]]ic musician and composer [[<U+00D3>lafur Arnalds]] returned as the series' musical and sound composer.

While conceiving and writing the first series in 2012, ''Broadchurch'' creator and lead writer Chris Chibnall designed his story to be told as a trilogy.<ref name=trilogy>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/featherstone-broadchurch-planned-as-trilogy/5062879.article|last=White|first=Peter|title=Featherstone: Broadchurch 'planned as trilogy'|newspaper=Broadcast Now|date=24 October 2013|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=cultbox>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultbox.co.uk/news/headlines/6511-broadchurch-creator-unsure-about-series-2 |title='Broadchurch' creator unsure about Series 2|publisher=CultBox|date=29 March 2013|accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref> Series one was written to work both as the first part of this trilogy as well as a self-contained drama.

As series one aired, Chibnall had discussions with ITV executives about commissioning series two. According to Chibnall, ITV was more concerned that people were enjoying the show than they were with the series' ratings (which were very high). ITV agreed to [[green-light]] series two about midway through the airing of series one.  This allowed Chibnall to announce series two as a "gift" to viewers at the end of series one, so the public would not remain in suspense about a second series.<ref name=chibnallsecret>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s218/broadchurch/interviews/a482834/broadchurch-chris-chibnall-qa-i-asked-to-keep-series-two-secret.html#~oXHlOSv3SpnXhg|last=Jeffrey|first=Morgan|title='Broadchurch' Chris Chibnall Q&A: 'I asked to keep series two secret'|newspaper=Digital Spy|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref>

Chibnall told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in the summer of 2013 that "the focus of the next series will be on how the shattered community rebuilds itself after the grisly events" of series one.<ref name=jefferiesexhumed>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/broadchurch-series-2-pictures-spoilers-3627032|last=Jefferies|first=Mark|title= Broadchurch series 2 pictures spoilers: David Tennant and Olivia Colman on set but whose grave is being exhumed?|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> Series one actor [[Will Mellor]] strongly implied in an interview that a new murder would not be the focus of the new season,<ref name=jefferiesexhumed /> while actor [[David Tennant]] told the ''[[Associated Press]]'' that the series would go in a "very unexpected direction" which he called "as gripping as the first season".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://metronews.ca/scene/1198915/tennant-new-direction-for-broadchurch-season-2/|last=Neff|first=Lauri|title=Tennant: New Direction for 'Broadchurch' Season 2|newspaper=Associated Press|date=30 October 2014|accessdate=30 October 2014}}</ref> While grief was the key theme of series one, Chibnall chose an entirely different theme for series two.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-29/broadchurch-writer-chris-chibnall-on-series-two-grief-is-not-our-driving-emotion-this-year|last=Delgado|first=Kasia|title=Broadchurch writer Chris Chibnall on series two: 'Grief is not our driving emotion this year'|newspaper=Radio Times|date=29 December 2014|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref> Tennant described series two as "Tonally, it's the same show, but structurally, it's completely different."<ref name=tweets>{{cite news|url=http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Broadchurch-ITV-drama-returns-Monday-night-tell/story-25802994-detail/story.html|title=Broadchurch: The ITV drama returns on Monday night to tell different story|newspaper=Western Daily Press|date=4 January 2015|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>

Chibnall said he mapped out the show's plot and characters on several [[whiteboard]]s in his office before beginning the writing process. "You have to be very methodical," he said about plotting ''Broadchurch''. "It's like a mathematical puzzle where you put all these blocks together and move them around for the most satisfying thing."<ref name=clue /> Chibnall was assisted in [[storyboard]]ing series two by his good friend Sam Hoyle, a television script executive who also worked with him in laying out series one. "By the time I sat down to type scenes and dialogue," Chibnall said, "I'd already done quite a lot of work."<ref name=earledream>{{cite news|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/broadchurch-creator-chris-chibnall-talks-david-tennant-and-why-olivia-colman-is-a-writers-dream-9958324.html|last=Earle|first=Toby|title=Broadchurch creator Chris Chibnall talks David Tennant and why Olivia Colman is a 'writer's dream'|newspaper=London Evening Standard|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> As early as mid-July 2013, Chibnall told the ''Daily Mirror'' that he had finalized the plot and written the second series' first and last scenes, and was now working on the rest of the script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/broadchurch-writer-chris-chibnall-written-2045178|last=Methven|first=Nicola|title=Broadchurch writer has written first and last scenes of second series and now 'just needs to fill other eight hours'|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|date=11 July 2013|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref> Chibnall also said that the second series' themes, story, and basic mysteries are clearly established by the end of the first episode.<ref name=Campellithrill>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcasters/chris-chibnall-broadchurch-return-to-be-more-thrilling/5081259.article|last=Campelli|first=Matthew|title=Chris Chibnall: Broadchurch return to be more thrilling|newspaper=Broadcast|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> Much of series two draws on plot elements established in series one. Lead actor Olivia Colman noted "You find out very early in the first episode which direction it's going in and it's an instant, 'Whoooa!'.

In August 2014, [[Erin Kelly (author)|Erin Kelly]], author of the ''Broadchurch'' novelisation, said that Chibnall inserted a one-line clue about series two into her book three days before printing was due to begin.

Eve Myles' [[talent agent|agent]] called her on 15 February 2014, just four days after Myles gave birth to her daughter, Sienna, telling Myles of the opportunity to audition for ''Broadchurch''. Myles auditioned on videotape in her home, performing her scenes as swiftly as she could before her child made noise or needed attention. After being cast in series two, Myles received the script for the first episode. "I kept it for bedtime; lights off, ipad out, cup of tea in bed," she said. "It was amazing, like watching a film, the writing is so good. I was shocked, exhilarated and surprised. And it made me laugh."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.david-tennant-news.com/blog/broadchurch-series-2-eve-myles-says-first-script-amazing-like-watching-film/|last=Malkin|first=Diane|title=Broadchurch Series 2: Eve Myles Says The First Script Was 'Amazing, Like Watching a Film'|website=David Tennant News|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=20 December 2014}}</ref>

The role of Nigel Carter's adopted mother was played by Anne Sims, the mother of actor Joe Sims. ''Broadchurch'' series one had photographs of character Nigel Carter with his adopted mother. The production used actual photos of Sims as a child and teenager with his real-life mother, Anne. When series two needed an actress to play Nigel's adopted mother in a few scenes, Sims suggested his own mother play the role. The producers quickly agreed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Crime-dramas-long-road-gobby-kid-stardom/story-22861702-detail/story.html|title=Bristol actor Joe Sims reveals his long road from 'gobby kid' to stardom|newspaper=The Bristol Post|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

Eight-month-old twin girls Ava and Millie Priddis also were cast in series two.  The daughters of Luke Priddis and his partner Rosie, of Beacon Heath, [[Exeter]], the girls' paternal grandmother saw a newspaper advertisement for twin babies to appear on television. Although hundreds of twins applied, the producers settled on Ava and Millie just 30 minutes after receiving their photograph. The girls play a role in the Latimer family, but the exact nature of the role was not clear prior to airing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Exeter-twins-star-new-series-Broadchurch/story-25807140-detail/story.html|title=Exeter twins to star in new series of Broadchurch|newspaper=Exeter Express and Echo|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>

The production was much larger than for the first series. With many scenes taking place outside the small fictional town of Broadchurch, the production expanded away from the Jurassic Coast to include many more locations over a much of Southwest England. With an increase in the size of the cast, this created significant new logistical obstacles. Series two had a concomitant increase in budget, and a much more complex production schedule compared to series one.<ref name=earledream />

===Secrecy===
The plot of series two was a closely guarded secret, and ITV and Kudos held meetings to plan security measures long before shooting began.<ref name=Campellithrill /> Although already one of series two's highest-budget items, the cost of security on series two went significantly over budget as the public and press sought to learn about the plot.<ref name=johnstongood /> All documents were

Producer Richard Stokes revealed in October 2013 that most of the action in the second series would not take place in the fictional town of Broadchurch, but another fictional town. The Broadchurch name was retained, however, because "[it's] a brand and it's gained huge popularity so you can't risk losing that by changing the name."<ref name=mysterydeepens /> Press outlets confirmed in March 2014 that at least part of the second series would still take place in the fictional town of Broadchurch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bridportnews.co.uk/news/11104052.West_Bay_set_to_be_a_Broadchurch_star_again/|last=Bell|first=Anne|title=West Bay set to be a Broadchurch star again|newspaper=Bridport News|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=3 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=lazaruscasting /> At least one scene was filmed in a cemetery, and others depicted a very pregnant Beth Latimer.<ref name=independenmidsomer />

The secrecy campaign was critised by reporter Susanna Lazarus of ''Radio Times''. While generally decrying the over-use of plot highlights and one-liners in film and television marketing, she argued that there was nonetheless a role for [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]] so that audiences could decide which shows to watch among the wide array of media choices. There was a "thin line", she said, between too much and too little information, but she asked the producers of ''Broadchurch'' to walk it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-01-05/broadchurch-is-no-spoilers-a-good-thing|last=Lazarus|first=Susanna|title=Broadchurch: is no spoilers a good thing?|newspaper=Radio Times|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref>

Much of ''Broadchurch'' series two was shot on location. Chibnall felt location shooting was critical to the mood and tone of series two, much as it was for series one. While many crime dramas are shot in gritty, urban locations, Chibnall believed that the bucolic Jurassic Coast setting signaled to viewers that ''Broadchurch'' was not a typical detective program.<ref name=mikejones /> Producer Richard Stokes said that the Dorset area provided "that sense of the extraordinary, [that] the tragic and the terrible [can] happen in a rather beautiful and moving environment."<ref name=mikejones /> Early in the pre-production process, the producers and location managers discussed filming in locations other than Dorset. Among the areas considered were cliff locations near [[Bristol]]; [[Essex]]; [[Hastings]] in [[East Sussex]]; [[Kent]]; and [[Weston-super-Mare]] in [[Somerset]]. But the producers felt none of the locations could replicate the look of the Jurassic Coast, and the quality of the light in each area was different than in Dorset.<ref name=mikejones />

Filming began in late May 2014, with the first cast [[read-through]] occurring on 22 May.<ref name=dorsetechofirst>{{cite news|url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/11230713.First_read_through_for_Broadchurch_2_takes_place/|title=First read-through for Broadchurch 2 takes place|newspaper=The Dorset Echo|date=22 May 2014|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> About 70 cast and crew worked on ''Broadchurch'' series two, and each episode took 12 and a half days to complete.<ref name=simsreturns /> Joel Holmes was the production's location manager.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://Fwww.clevedon.gov.uk/controls/DownloadDocument.ashx?docID=zi5473JQMOCCWHYPWN3617oGxj%26aID=4710|author=Clevedon Town Council|title=Minutes of the Town Events & Amenities Committee|date=1 October 2014|page=722|format=PDF}}</ref> The code name "Tea and Sympathy" was used as a cover to disguise as much of the production's activities as possible.<ref name=filmingends />

On 20 December 2014, Chibnall revealed that a blue [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] chalet is integral to the mystery presented in series two. Chibnall said the chalet is where "lots <U+2014> if not all <U+2014> of the secrets" of series two are hidden, and that the chalet (just {{convert|200|yd|m}} from the site of Danny's murder in series one, according to the show's geography) will be seen in the first minute of episode one.<ref name=cheekiest />

David Tennant took a break from filming the second series to shoot episodes of ''Broadchurch''{{'s}} American remake, ''Gracepoint''. He returned to the ''Broadchurch'' series two production about 15 September 2014.<ref name=tennantreturns />

The production team was strongly criticised by the West Bay Coastguards in June 2014 for filming too close to the edge of East Cliff at West Bay. Severe weather and recent rockslides left the cliffs unstable, and a Coastguard volunteer said the production team should have used stakes, safety lines, harnesses, and helmets. A spokesperson for the ''Broadchurch'' production defended the film crew, noting that the production team received all necessary filming permits, visited the site numerous times to ensure safety, and took other reasonable health and safety precautions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10884915/PLS-PIC-and-PUB-Broadchurch-crew-criticised-for-unnecessary-silly-risk-by-filming-at-dangerous-cliff-edge.html|last=Furness|first=Hannah|title=Broadchurch crew criticised for 'unnecessary, silly risk' by filming at dangerous cliff edge|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=8 June 2014|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref>

Filming for series two of ''Broadchurch 2'' concluded just before midnight on 12 October 2014.<ref name=filmingends /><ref name=echofilmingends>{{cite news|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11538327.EXCLUSIVE__Broadchurch_2_producer_thanks_West_Dorset_residents_for_their_support_during_filming/|last=Gerryts|first=Rene|title=EXCLUSIVE: Broadchurch 2 producer thanks West Dorset residents for their support during filming|newspaper=Bournemouth Echo|date=16 October 2014|accessdate=25 October 2014}}</ref> Final scenes were shot at the village of Eype.<ref name=filmingends />

===Studio shooting and shooting schedule===
Unlike the first series, series two contained a great deal of studio filming. Chibnall said this was because of the changed nature of the story, and he said that nearly all the major story moments in the second series occurred on a stage.<ref name=gilbertreveal /> David Tennant said that while the Jurassic Coast and several locations from series one are still featured in series two, most shooting occurred on studio sets near London.<ref name=coastline>{{cite news|url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/11673792.Coastline_inspires_stars_of_hit_TV_drama/|last=Davis|first=Joanna|title=Coastline inspires stars of hit TV drama Broadchurch|newspaper=Dorset Echo|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref>

Some sets were built at [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Longcross]], [[Surrey]], where art director John West built a very large set.<ref name=bectu>{{cite web|url=https://www.bectu.org.uk/advice-resources/crewbus/234058f7d692a0bfc8b3e2c2190d6cb0?image=305|title=John West|website=BECTU.org.uk|date=2014|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref>{{Efn|The decision to film near [[London]] was apparently made before series one ended.

===Acting===
The casting of Rampling led to apprehension among many series two cast members, who were intimidated by her. But Chris Chibnall said that Rampling's humor (she's "a proper giggler") alleviated this immediately.<ref name=ramplingexotic /> Colman described Marianne Jean-Baptiste as "the coolest women on the planet", and said that Eve Myles and Phoebe Waller-Bridge (a long-time friend of Colman's) both had a terrific sense of humor to the production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/broadchurch-8375317|last=McCrum|first=Kirstie|title='Like going back to a childhood holiday' - we quiz Olivia Colman on the return of ITV's Broadchurch|website=Wales Online|date=3 January 2015|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>

Chibnall had particular praise for Olivia Colman's performance. "She's got such range, Olivia. ... She can do anything I throw at her <U+2014> she's a writer's dream."<ref name=earledream />

==Musical soundtrack==
Icelandic musician and composer <U+00D3>lafur Arnalds{{Efn|This is an Icelandic name. The last name is a family name, but in Iceland people are properly referred to by their given name, e.g., <U+00D3>lafur.}} composed the music for ''Broadchurch'' series two, as he did for series one.<ref name=itvpressrelease /> <U+00D3>lafur met with Chibnall and the other producers to discuss the score on 16 August 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/OlafurArnalds/status/500590741148950528|title=The first Broadchurch 2 score meeting took place this morning in London.

<U+00D3>lafur [[Twitter]]ed on 8 October that the series two soundtrack would have a much stronger [[percussion]] sound. Doddi, a member of the musical quartet that performs with <U+00D3>lafur in live shows, provided the percussion music and sounds for the new soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/OlafurArnalds/status/519948022042877952|title=I felt #Broadchurch needed more rhythm this year|website=@OlafurArnalds at Twitter.com|date=8 October 2014|accessdate=4 December 2014|postscript=none}}; {{cite web|url=http://moreintelligentlife.com/blog/paul-sullivan/qa-%C3%B3lafur-arnalds-musician|last=Sullivan|first=Paul|title=The Q&A: <U+00D3>lafur Arnalds, Musician, Experimentalist|website=More Intelligent Life|date=2013|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> <U+00D3>lafur reported on 26 August that the opening episode involved a 10 minute long sequence underscored with music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/OlafurArnalds/status/504292777057071105|title=Feeling a bit overwhelmed by the fact that Episode 1 of Broadchurch 2 starts with a big 10 minute music cue!

Susanna Lazarus at ''Radio Times'' described the soundtrack as full of "ethereal vocals and haunting music".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-11/broadchurch-series-two-trailer-what-have-we-learned|last=Lazarus|first=Susanna|title=Broadchurch series two trailer: what have we learned?|newspaper=Radio Times|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref>

==Post-production==
The [[post-production]] process was a lengthy one. Actress Jodie Whittaker said that the cast would not able to preview their performances before they aired on ITV in January.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-05/broadchurchs-jodie-whittaker-we-were-emotional-wrecks-on-set-but-david-tennant-held-it-together|last=Lazarus|first=Susanna|title=Broadchurch's Jodie Whittaker: we were emotional wrecks on set but David Tennant held it together|newspaper=Radio Times|date=5 December 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

Audio post-production was overseen by Sonorous, a company founded in 2013 by Howard Bargroff. Sound mixing was done using [[PMC Ltd.]]{{'s}} twotwo.6s nearfield [[studio monitor]]s.<ref name=iabm>{{cite web|url=http://www.theiabm.org/news/latest-news/latest-news_detail.sherlock-broadchurch-mix-engineer-installs-pmc-in-dubbing-room.html|title=Sherlock & Broadchurch Mix Engineer Installs PMC In Dubbing Room|website=International Association of Broadcasting Manufacturers|date=12 November 2014|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>{{efn|"Nearfield" loudspeakers are those which are intended to be three times closer to the listener than the nearest hard surface.

==Marketing==
On 9 November 2014, two 20-second teaser trailers began airing on ITV, each titled "The End Is Where It Begins".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-11-09/the-end-is-where-it-begins-in-the-first-teasers-for-broadchurch-series-two|last=Lazarus|first=Susanna|title='The End Is Where It Begins' in the first teasers for Broadchurch series two|newspaper=[[Radio Times]]|date=9 November 2014|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> On 16 November 2014, a third 20-second teaser trailer aired on ITV, in two versions, voiced by characters Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller, respectively. These were also titled "The End Is Where It Begins".<ref name=goodacreconfirmed>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s218/broadchurch/news/a610483/broadchurch-series-2-january-2015-return-date-confirmed-in-new-teasers.html|last=Goodacre|first=Kate|title='Broadchurch series 2: January 2015 return date confirmed in new teasers|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=16 November 2014|accessdate=16 November 2014|}}</ref>

A fourth series two trailer was released on 11 December, with ITV announcing a series two air date of 5 January 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/watch-new-broadchurch-series-2-4792062|last=Walker|first=Danny|title=Watch new Broadchurch series 2 trailer as David Tennant promises he 'can't do it on his own'|newspaper=The Daily Mirror|date=11 December 2014|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> ITV released only a small portion of the full trailer at first, and said it would release longer versions on YouTube as the [[hashtag]] #BroadchurchReturns was [[Twitter|tweeted]] a certain number of times. (The network did not disclose the retweet goals it established.) ITV executive creative director Tony Pipes said the goal was to generate online buzz about series two.<ref name=campellikickoff />

Other marketing efforts included an [[Below the line (advertising)|above the line]]" online advertising campaign. This consisted primarily of a linear advertising campaign.{{Efn|Linear advertising is marketing which is straightforward and occurs during a specific time for a predetermined duration. This kind of advertising treats all consumers as the same, and does not seek to target subsegments of the population. Linear advertising does not change if it recurs.}}{{sfn|Hackley|2005|pages=30-31}} ITV also said it would begin [[billboard]] advertising after Christmas 2014.<ref name=campellikickoff />

Another marketing component involved the publication of short stories after each episode airs. Chibnall was so enthused by author Erin Kelly's novelisation of ''Broadchurch'' series one that ITV contracted with her to write a short story to accompany each episode. The short stories, each to be published individually as an [[e-book]], focus on a single character from series two.<ref name=lazaruscertain />
