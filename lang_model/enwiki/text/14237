==Colonial military service==
===Early colonial military career===
McDonald arrived in Virginia at the port of [[Falmouth, Virginia|Falmouth]] on the [[Rappahannock River]].<ref name = "Williams1"/><ref name = "Brannon1"/><ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "WVDAH1">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Department of Archives and History|1976|p=312.}}</ref> Among the belongings he brought with him were the [[Classification of swords#Short sword|short sword]], [[sash]] and [[gorget]] bearing the Glengarry [[Scottish heraldry|coat of arms]] that he had worn at the Battle of Culloden.<ref name = "Williams1"/><ref name = "Miller1"/> Following his arrival, McDonald remained in Falmouth for two or three years where he worked as a [[merchant]].<ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Williams2">{{Harvnb|Williams|1911|p=28.}}</ref> McDonald moved west into Virginia's interior and entered the military service of the colonial government under [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Robert Dinwiddie]], receiving the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].<ref name = "Brannon1"/><ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Williams2"/> In return for his "meritorious service" in conflicts against [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], McDonald received {{convert|400|acre|km2|}} of land from the colonial government of Virginia in 1754.<ref name = "Brannon1"/><ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Jones1"/><ref name = "Williams2"/> Around 1754, McDonald moved further west to the settlement of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]].<ref name = "Brannon1"/><ref name = "WHS3"/> McDonald established the first [[Masonic Lodge]] there in 1760.<ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Williams2"/><ref name = "Brannon2">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=374.}}</ref> While in Winchester, McDonald served as a member of the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] there.<ref name = "Williams2"/>

In 1765, McDonald returned to military service when he was commissioned by [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]] as a [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] in command of the [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]] [[Militia (United States)|militia]].<ref name = "WHS3"/><ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Williams2"/><ref name = "Brannon2"/> That same year, Lord Fairfax appointed McDonald as an [[Attorney (England and Wales)|attorney]] and [[land agent]] for his [[Northern Neck Proprietary]].<ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Williams2"/><ref name = "Brannon2"/> By 1769, McDonald was a [[magistrate]] of the Frederick County court along with associate magistrates Lord Fairfax, [[Samuel Washington]] (brother of [[George Washington]]), Warner Washington (Washington's first cousin), Taverner Beale and Reverend [[Charles Mynn Thruston (colonel)|Charles Mynn Thruston]].<ref name = "Wayland1">{{Harvnb|Wayland|2009|p=132.}}</ref>

In the Spring of 1774, McDonald participated in an expedition surveying the "military bounty lands" lying along the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Kanawha River|Kanawha]] rivers to be granted by the colonial government of Virginia to soldiers and officers in exchange for their military service in the French and Indian War.<ref name = "Miller2"/><ref name = "Smucker1">{{Harvnb|Smucker|1875|p=24.}}</ref><ref name = "Washington1">{{Harvnb|Washington|1889|pp=411<U+2013>412.}}</ref><ref name = "Heard1">{{Harvnb|Heard|1987|p=228.}}</ref> The expedition was cut short due to hostilities with Native Americans,<ref name = "Miller2"/><ref name = "Smucker1"/><ref name = "Washington1"/><ref name = "Heard1"/> and McDonald provided an account of these hostilities and reports he received of attacks against settlers to Lord Dunmore.<ref name = "Smucker1"/><ref name = "Washington1"/><ref name = "Heard1"/> McDonald's accounts along with those of other settlers resulted in Lord Dunmore's decision to wage a war against the Native Americans to pacify the frontier lands of western Virginia for continued settlement.<ref name = "Smucker1"/><ref name = "Washington1"/><ref name = "Heard1"/>

===McDonald's Expedition and Dunmore's War===
In early June of 1774, Lord Dunmore further commissioned McDonald as a ranking military officer of an expedition (known as "McDonald's Expdition") to promptly organize and recruit [[settler]]s west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] along the [[Youghiogheny River|Youghiogheny]] and [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] [[river]]s in order to defend [[European American]] settlements from Native American attacks.<ref name = "Smucker1"/><ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1">{{Harvnb|R. Sutton & Company|1883|p=32.}}</ref><ref name = "WHS1">{{Harvnb|Wisconsin Historical Society|1905|p=155.}}</ref> Lord Dunmore commissioned [[Michael Cresap]] as a captain under McDonald's command and placed him in charge of the enlistment of a force from [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]].<ref name = "Smucker1"/> McDonald and Cresap's combined forces numbered approximately 400 men following their convergence near present-day [[Wheeling, West Virginia|Wheeling]] on the [[Ohio River]].<ref name = "Smucker1"/><ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/><ref name = "WHS1"/> In addition to Cresap, other captains in the expedition included Michael Cresap, Jr., Hancock Lee, [[Daniel Morgan]], [[James Wood (governor)|James Wood]] and Henry Hoagland.<ref name = "WHS1"/> 

Once the entire force had converged near Wheeling, McDonald and Captain [[William Crawford (soldier)|William Crawford]] directed the construction of [[Fort Henry (West Virginia)|Fort Fincastle]] in July 1774.<ref name = "Butterfield1">{{Harvnb|Butterfield|1877|p=96.}}</ref><ref name = "HSP1">{{Harvnb|Historical Society of Pennsylvania|1891|pp=242<U+2013>243.}}</ref> Following the erection of the stockade, McDonald ordered each of his soldiers to pack seven days' worth of provisions.<ref name = "WHS1"/> On July 26, 1774, his forces crossed the Ohio River at the [[River mouth|mouth]] of Fish Creek about {{convert|24|mi|km|}} south of Fort Fincastle.<ref name = "WHS1"/><ref name = "Butterfield1"/> McDonald's forces continued down the Ohio River in [[boat]]s and [[canoe]]s until they reached the mouth of [[Captina Creek]], from which they marched toward the [[Shawnee]] villages of [[Wakatomika]] (also known as Wapatomica) near the mouth of [[Wakatomika Creek]] (modern-day [[Dresden, Ohio|Dresden]], [[Ohio]]) on the [[Muskingum River]].<ref name = "Brannon2"/><ref name = "Smucker1"/><ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/><ref name = "WHS1"/> McDonald's forces had not encountered any enemy Native American forces on their expedition until about {{convert|6|mi|km|}} from Wakatomika, where they were [[ambush]]ed by a force of approximately 30 to 50 Shawnee arranged in columns at the head of a [[swamp]]y crossing.<ref name = "Smucker1"/><ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/><ref name = "WHS1"/> The ambush resulted in the deaths of two soldiers and the wounding of up to eight or nine more.<ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/><ref name = "WHS1"/> 

Following the ambush, McDonald and his forces reached the Muskingum River around [[Dusk|nightfall]] on August 2, 1774.<ref name = "WHS2">{{Harvnb|Wisconsin Historical Society|1905|p=156.}}</ref> McDonald and his forces arrived at the "chief Wakatomika town" only to discover that it had been evacuated by its Shawnee inhabitants, who were found nearby preparing to ambush McDonald's forces.<ref name = "Smucker2"/><ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/> The Shawnee in ambuscade [[surrender (military)|surrender]]ed to McDonald in exchange for peace.<ref name = "Smucker2"/><ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/> McDonald's forces continued their march onto the next Wakatomika settlement, where a further ambush ensued resulting in the burning of Shawnee [[Log cabin|cabins]] and villages and the destruction of their [[plantation]]s and [[maize]] fields.<ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/><ref name = "WHS1"/> McDonald and his forces took three Shawnee [[Scalping|scalps]] and one prisoner.<ref name = "WHS1"/> McDonald and his forces returned to Wheeling with three Shawnee [[tribal chief]]s as captives, who were then sent on to the colonial Virginia seat of government, [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].<ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/> McDonald completed the expedition, which met its goal of temporarily relieving western Virginia frontier settlements from Native American attack.<ref name = "R. Sutton & Company1"/> He continued to serve under Lord Dunmore until the end of the war.<ref name = "WHS4">{{Harvnb|Wisconsin Historical Society|1905|p=153.}}</ref> In a letter dated January 8, 1775, following his return to Winchester from Williamsburg, McDonald recounted of the war, "all the Country is well pleased with the Governours Expeditions."<ref name = "WHS4"/><ref name = "WHS5">{{Harvnb|Wisconsin Historical Society|1905|p=395.}}</ref> Following Dunmore's War in December 1774, McDonald was further promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]].<ref name = "WHS3"/><ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Brannon3">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=375.}}</ref> 

On August 6, 1776, McDonald was appointed and took the oath of the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] and [[Judge|justice]] of Frederick County by the [[county court]] under an ordinance of the [[Virginia Conventions|Virginia Convention of 1776]].<ref name = "Miller2"/><ref name = "Brannon3"/><ref name = "Williams3">{{Harvnb|Williams|1911|p=29.}}</ref> While serving as sheriff, he was placed in command of the militias of both [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta]] and Frederick counties.<ref name = "Brannon3"/> At the time of his command of the Frederick and Augusta militias, the two counties encompassed much of the territory of Virginia between the [[Ohio River]], the [[Tennessee]] boundary and the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], with the exception of Hampshire County which had been created from parts of Frederick and Augusta counties in 1754.<ref name = "Miller2"/><ref name = "Brannon3"/>

==American Revolutionary War==
During the onset of the [[American Revolution]], McDonald was an ardent [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whig]].<ref name = "WHS3"/><ref name = "Miller2"/> In March 1777, McDonald received a [[personal letter]] from General [[George Washington]] appointing him a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in a [[battalion]] of [[Thruston's Additional Continental Regiment]] under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Charles Mynn Thruston, a former [[Rector#Anglican churches|rector]] of Cunningham Chapel in present-day [[Clarke County, Virginia|Clarke County]], Virginia<ref name = "Miller2"/> and a former associate magistrate of the Frederick County court, where he served alongside McDonald.<ref name="Wayland1"/> Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause, McDonald refused<ref name = "WVDAH1"/> the appointment for either of two reasons:<ref name = "Miller2"/> he would have been [[second-in-command]] to a colonel lacking prior military experience<ref name = "WHS3"/><ref name = "Miller2"/> and McDonald had previously been a member of the [[vestry]] of Cunningham Chapel and resigned following a dispute with Thruston over "a matter of business with the church."<ref name = "Miller2"/> General [[Adam Stephen]], a fellow [[Scottish people|Scotsman]], wrote a letter to McDonald dated March 15, 1777 in which he implored him to accept Washington's appointment, stating "Your appointment comes entirely from your own merit."<ref name = "HSP1"/> Stephen warned McDonald not to let his "Highland pride" dissuade him from serving under Thruston and in the event McDonald still refused Washington's offer, Stephen wrote: "Write a polite letter to General Washington thanking his excellency for his notice and making the best excuse you can."<ref name = "HSP1"/> 

McDonald was later appointed by Washington to serve as a lieutenant colonel in command of Virginia revolutionary militia forces during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name = "SAR2"/> He also served on various revolutionary committees throughout the war.<ref name = "SAR2"/> McDonald died on August 19, 1778 at his home "Glengarry" near Winchester after receiving an incorrect dosage of the medication [[potassium antimonyl tartrate]].<ref name = "Miller1"/><ref name = "Brannon3"/><ref name = "Williams4">{{Harvnb|Williams|1911|p=38.}}</ref>
