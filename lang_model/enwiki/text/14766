The '''MSW Votec 252T''' is a single engine [[homebuilt aircraft|kitbuilt]] [[light-sport aircraft]] with [[tandem#Side-by-side seating|side-by-side]] seating for two, designed and built in [[Switzerland]] and was first flown in 2009. By October 2011 only this first prototype has flown.
 
==Design and development==

The Votec 252T is a side-by side seat development of MSW's earlier [[tandem]] seat Votec 322.  The prototype, powered by a modified [[Lycoming IO-540]]-J3A5 [[flat-six engine]], marries the wooden wings and [[empennage]] of the latter to a new, [[carbon fibre]] [[fuselage]], though a carbon fibre wing is under development.  All flying surfaces are straight tapered and square tipped, the wing [[monoplane#Types of monoplane|low mounted]] and the tailplane located on the upper fuselage; the rudder extends down to the keel. The [[aileron]]s are balanced with external [[aileron#spades|spades]].<ref name=JAWA12/>

The Votec 252T has a cabin over the wing, with baggage space behind the seat, under a single piece [[Canopy (aircraft)|canopy]].  It has a fixed [[tricycle undercarriage]] with fuselage mounted [[cantilever]] legs and with [[aircraft fairing|speed fairings]] on all wheels.  The nosewheel casters; there is a small tailskid for rudder protection.<ref name=JAWA12/>

The first prototype flew on 26 June 2009.  A second prototype with a 260&nbsp;kW (350&nbsp;hp) [[Lycoming IO-580|Lycoming AEIO-580]] engine, redesignated the '''Votec 352T''', is under development but had not flown by October 2011.<ref name=JAWA12/>
