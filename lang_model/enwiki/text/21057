'''Vaita<U+1E37>a deu<U+1E37>a''' or '''Baitala deu<U+1E37>a'''({{Lang-or|<U+0B2C><U+0B07><U+0B24><U+0B3E><U+0B33> <U+0B26><U+0B47><U+0B09><U+0B33>}}, [[Devnagari]]:<U+0935><U+0948><U+0924><U+093E><U+0933> <U+0926><U+0947><U+0909><U+0933>) is a 9th century [[Hindu temple]] typical [[Kalinga architecture|Khakara temple]] dedicated to Goddess [[Chamunda]] located in [[Bhubaneswar]], the capital city of [[Orissa]], [[India]].

==Architecture==
'''Baita<U+1E37>a Deu<U+1E37>a''' Temple<U+2019>s striking feature is the shape of its sanctuary tower. The semi-cylindrical shape of its roof is a leading example of '''[[Khakhara Deula|Khakhara]]''' order of temples<U+2014> which bears an affinity to the [[Dravidan_style|Dravidian]] [[Gopuram]] of the South Indian temples. Its gabbled towers with a row of [[Sikhara]]s reveals unmistakable signs of southern intrusion.<ref>D.P.Ghosh, Nirmal Kumar Bose and Y.D.Sharma. ''Designs from Orissan Temples''. P.24</ref>
The plan of the deu<U+1E37>a is oblong and the ''[[Jaga mohan]]'' is a rectangular structure, but embedded in each angle is a small subsidiary [[shrine]]. '''Baitala deu<U+1E37>a''' boasts of some figures, although executed in relief, are however characterized by delicacy of features and perfect equipoise.

The outer walls are encrusted with panels of Hindu deities, mostly [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Parvati]] in her [[Shakti]] form, hunting processions, capturing of wild elephants and the occasional erotic couples.

The facade of the deu<U+1E37>a above the left of the ''Jagamohana'' is dominated by two ''Chaitya'' windows<U+2014> the lower one having a beautifully carved figure of Sun God ([[Surya]]) noted for its facial expression, with [[Usha_(goddess)|Usha]] (Dawn) and Pratyusha shooting arrows on either side and with [[Aru<U+1E47>a|A]]runa in front, driving a chariot of seven horses. 

The medallion in the upper ''Chaitya'' window houses a 10-armed [[Nataraja]] or dancing [[Shiva]]. In front of the flat roofed ''Jagamohana'' is a stone post relieved with two Buddha like figures seated in '''Dharma-Chakra-Pravartana mudra'''.

Another striking feature is temple's [[Tantra|Tantric]] associations, marked by eerie carvings in the sanctum and the image enshrined in the central niche, eight armed [[Chamunda]], locally known as '''''Kapa<U+1E37>ini''''', is the terrifying form of goddess [[Durga]]. Thus, '''Baita<U+1E37>a Deu<U+1E37>a''' is a [[Shakti]] shrine.

==The Deity==
The presiding deity, [[Chamunda]] or Charchika sits on a corpse flanked by a jackal and an owl and decorated with a garland of skulls. She holds a snake, bow, shield, sword, trident, thunderbolt and an arrow, and is piercing the neck of the demon. The niche is capped by a chaitya window containing seated figures of Shiva and Parvati.

The Chamunda is surrounded by a host of other smaller size allied deities carved in the lower parts of the walls, each within a niche separate by a pilaster. The figure on the east wall, to the fight of the door, is a skeleton form of [[Bhairava]] forming the counter part of Chamunda.

The other, carved on the north wall, rises from ground, having filled his skull-cup with the blood of a person whose severed head lies on the right. On the pedestal is an offering of two more heads on a tray resting on a tripod, flanked by a jackal feasting on the decapitated body on the right and a woman holding a head on the left.
 
The tantric character of the temple is also marked by the stone post, to which sacrificial offerings were tethered, just in front of the jagamohana. You need an artificial light to see in the darkness of the interior, though early morning sun lights up the interior.
