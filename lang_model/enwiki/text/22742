'''"One in Every Crowd"''' is a song recorded by [[United States|American]] country music duo [[Montgomery Gentry]]. It is the third single released from their sixth studio album, ''[[Back When I Knew It All]]''. Eddie Montgomery, one-half of the duo, co-wrote the song with Kim Tribble and former [[Trick Pony]] bassist Ira Dean.

==Content==
"One in Every Crowd" is an up-tempo with [[electric guitar]] accompaniment, written by Eddie Montgomery (one-half of Montgomery Gentry), along with Kim Tribble and Ira Dean, the latter of whom was formerly bassist in the trio [[Trick Pony]]. Montgomery and Troy Gentry, the duo's other half, alternate on lead vocals. The verses describe a male character who is the life of the party whenever he goes to a bar, while the chorus reveals that the character being described is actually the narrator ("There's one in every crowd / And it's usually me"). A crowd sings "hey y'all" after the choruses.
