'''COSMOS (Children of Soldier Machine Organic System)''' (<U+30B3><U+30B9><U+30E2><U+30B9> ''Kosumosu'') or formally known as '''PROJECT COSMOS''' in the manga series [[Spriggan (manga)|Spriggan]] is a fictional military unit operating as a covert operations unit of the [[United States military]]. Appearances/references to COSMOS in the American translation '''Striker''' were edited out since the unit was an allusion to American participation in covert operations during the Cold War <ref>Spriggan had a heavy anti-Western theme as the authors saw countries like the US, Russia and other first world countries as having hidden motives for conducting "legal" military operations in foreign soil. {{cite news | title=Spriggan Trivia| date=May 15, 2006 | publisher=Anime News Network | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/manga.php?id=2425 }}</ref>.

{{spoiler-blank|The article contains spoilers on the origin of COSMOS and its involvement in the Spriggan manga (and to a lesser note, OVA) series}} 

==History==

Created as a secret [[black ops|black op]] unit operating under the cover of the [[United States]] [[military]], most of its ranks are filled with child soldiers of various nationalities. Kidnapped by the US military with backing from [[CIA|Central Intelligence Agency]] agents, the children are subjected to high amounts of [[brainwash|brainwashing]] conducted by [[research]] [[scientist]]s so as not to regain any control over themselves.

The unit had secretly conducted [[covert operations]] from around the world, performing secret missions without involving the US [[military]]. Nearing the end of the series, COSMOS was sponsored by the [[Trident Corporation]] from the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] <ref>In Volume 4, Sho Kanaya was seen speaking with a man, whose face was obscured by shadow, while inside a US Army CH-47 [[Chinook]]. The man is believed to be [[Larry Markson]].</ref> when most of the unit took a massive number of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] from the [[Spriggans]] after launching a raid on their facility (a US Army base in [[Japan]]) in order to rescue Rie and Akiha, held captive in order to draw Yu out of hiding. <ref>Colonel Gwenson, even though commanded Sho to lead the raid, wanted to use it to draw Yu out of hiding and kill him for revenge after he was left to die by [[Yu Ominae]] after he regained self-consciousness.</ref>

COSMOS [[soldier]]s, now under the sponsorship of the [[Trident Corporation]], was granted exclusive access to their [[prototype]] [[assault rifle]]s as the unit was used as the [[corporation]]'s [[special forces]] unit. Currently, [[Trident Corporation]] is trying to use Sho Kanaya as a [[guinea pig]] to lead all active COSMOS [[soldier]]s with telepathic thoughts, reducing the need to field out experienced [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] to take [[command]] during any combat missions.

==Training==

COSMOS [[recruit]]s, after being heavily brainwashed, are taken into secret training camps throughout the [[United States]]. From there, they are givne [[special forces]]-level training such as [[commando]] skills, infiltration/exfiltration techniques, [[small arm]]s handlings and [[martial arts]]. 

Bowman, before heading to the [[Trident Corporation]], was a COSMOS [[instructor]] who taught [[Yu Ominae|Yu]] [[knife]] fighting. It was also assumed that he taught COSMOS recruits on fighting in hand-to-hand combat with dual knives.

==Equipment==

[[Image:COSMOS troopers.jpg|right|thumb|200px|COSMOS troopers before and after its integration into [[Trident Corporation]]. Note the difference in their uniform, as the trooper on the left does not bear any Trident insignia on his beret or uniform after [[Larry Markson]] gave COSMOS sponsorship status under the company. The one on the right bears the said insignias.]]

In most of its [[Military operation|mission]]s, COSMOS [[soldier]]s are armed with [[Heckler and Koch]] [[MP5|MP5SD6]] [[submachine gun]]s, [[Mossberg 590]] "Compact" shotguns and [[Glock 17]] pistols. Their [[standard]] [[equipment]] usually consist of [[olive green]] [[berets]], [[M17A1]] respirators and [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment|ALICE]] web gear.

After COSMOS was indoctrinated into Trident, they received mass-produced [[Armored Machine Suit]]s and sport Trident symbols on their berets and BDU collars.
