'''The Italian national water polo team''' represents [[Italy]] in men's international [[water polo]] competitions and is controlled by Federnuoto (the Italian Aquatics Federation). The national men's team has the nickname of "Settebello". 

The Italian men's water polo team has won 6 [[Water polo at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] medals, 5 [[Water polo world championship|World Championships]], 5 [[FINA Water Polo World Cup|World Cup]] medals, and one [[FINA Water Polo World League|World League]] medal, making them one of the most successful men's water polo teams in the world. They have won a combined six championships in those four competitions, with the World League being the only competition which Italy has yet to win.

==History==
[[Image:Italian waterpolo team circa 1950.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Italian water polo team, of the early 1950s]]
[[Water Polo]] became popular in Italy soon after 1899, when an exhibition match was played at the Bath of Diana in Milan, with the match being described in the press as: "like football but more tiring and difficult, requiring energy and strength beyond the ordinary".<ref>http://www.federnuoto.it/federazione.asp?p=testo&id=40 History of Italian Water Polo</ref>

Although a domestic league was soon established, the Italian national water polo team did not first compete at the Olympic Games until the [[Water polo at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Olympics]], in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]], where they were forced to forfeit their first round match, before losing 5-1 to [[Greece men's national water polo team|Greece]] and being eliminated.

The national team first fulfilled their potential at the [[Water polo at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]], [[England]], when they went undefeated for the whole tournament to claim their first gold medal in the discipline. 

The Italian team reclaimed the title of Olympic champions in front of a home crowd at the [[Water polo at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Italy won their third Olympic title at the [[Water polo at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], beating the hosts and tournament favourites [[Spain men's national water polo team|Spain]] 9-8 after extra time in a thrilling final. Only [[Hungary men's national water polo team|Hungary]] (9), and Great Britain (4) have more Olympic titles.

The Italian national side have also won two World Championships, in [[1978 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1978]] and [[1994 FINA Men's World Water Polo Championship|1994]], and the World Cup once in [[1993 FINA Men's Water Polo World Cup|1993]]. Italy also claimed their first European Championship in [[1995 Men's European Water Polo Championship|1995]].
