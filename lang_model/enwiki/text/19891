'''Svalbard''' is  an [[archipelago]] lying in the [[Arctic Ocean]] north of mainland [[Europe]], about midway between [[Norway]] and the [[North Pole]].  It consists of a [[island group|group of island]]s ranging from 76[[degree (angle)|<U+00B0>]] to 81<U+00B0> North, and 10<U+00B0> to 32<U+00B0> East. The archipelago is the northernmost part of the Kingdom of Norway. Three islands are populated: [[Spitsbergen]], [[Bj<U+00F8>rn<U+00F8>ya]] and [[Hopen]]. The largest settlement is [[Longyearbyen]]. The [[Svalbard Treaty]] recognises Norwegian [[sovereignty]] over Svalbard. With the [[1925]] Svalbard Act, Norway chose to make Svalbard a part of the Kingdom, and it remains one of four [[List of special entities recognized by international treaty or agreement|special entities whose status is recognized by international treaty]] in the world today.

== History ==
{{main|History of Svalbard}}

[[Viking]]s and [[Russians]] may have discovered Svalbard as early as the [[12th century]]. Traditional Norse accounts exist of a land known as ''Svalbar<U+00F0>i'' <U+2014> literally "cold edge". But the [[Netherlands|Dutch]]man [[Willem Barents]] made the first indisputable discovery of Svalbard in [[1596]]. From 1612 to 1720 [[whaling]] took place off the western coast of Spitsbergen, by Danish, Dutch, English, French and Norwegian ships. It is estimated that the Dutch alone took 60,000 whales from their base [[Smeerenburg]]. They also provided the headquarters for many [[Arctic]] [[exploration]] expeditions. Comprehensive geological mapping of the [[archipelago]] was conducted by teams from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and other universities, led primarily by [[W. Brian Harland]] from the [[1940s]] to [[1980s]].

The largest island in the archipelago is called [[Spitsbergen]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "Jagged mountains"); this name was formerly used to refer to the entire archipelago, while the main island was called [[West Spitsbergen]].

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of Svalbard}}
By the terms of the  international diplomacy recognized Norwegian sovereignty. Norway took over administration of Svalbard in [[1925]]. However, under the terms of this unique treaty, citizens of various other countries have rights to exploit mineral deposits and other natural resources "on a footing of absolute equality".  As a result, a permanent [[Russia]]n settlement, more or less autonomous, grew up at [[Barentsburg]].  Another Russian settlement at [[Pyramiden]] was abandoned in [[2000]]. At one time, the Russian (or [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) population of Svalbard considerably exceeded the Norwegian population, although this no longer applies. U.S., UK, German, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past.

According to Per Sefland, Norway's governor on the archipelago, the [[Svalbard Treaty]] of [[February 9]], [[1920]] implies that "If you're able to find a job, you have the right according to the treaty to come here." <ref>http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/A958838D-68A1-4B23-8F0E-062EBAE88544.htm</ref> The treaty states: "The nationals of all the high contracting parties [signatories] shall have equal liberty of access and entry for any reason or object whatever to the waters, fjords and ports of the territories." Therefore, many immigrants who have been denied residence to EU countries have relocated to Svalbard.

== Seed Bank ==
{{main|Svalbard Global Seed Vault}}

By the year 2007 the Norwegian government is planning on building a 'doomsday' seed bank in which as many (known) species' seeds as possible will be stored. As reported by [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4605398.stm BBC News] the Norwegian government will be building this bank by hollowing out a cave on [[Spitsbergen]] and then putting in as many seeds as possible with the support from countries around the world. The proposed bank will have top security blast-proof doors and would have two airlocks. The number of seeds stored will depend on the number of countries participating in the project. The initiative of this project is to prevent needed plants (wild, agricultural, etc.) from going extinct or becoming rare if a nuclear war were to break out or because of gene pollution from genetically engineered plants.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Svalbard}}

[[Image:Longyearbyen4.jpg|thumb|Picture overlooking Longyearbyen]]Svalbard consists of a group of [[island]]s in the [[Arctic Ocean]]; ranging from 76<U+00B0> to 81<U+00B0> North, and 10<U+00B0> to 32<U+00B0> East, it forms the northernmost part of [[Norway]] and the northernmost lands of [[Europe]]. The islands cover an area of 62&nbsp;050 [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]]. Three large islands dominate: ''[[Spitsbergen]]'' (39&nbsp;000 km<U+00B2>), [[Nordaustlandet]],  (Northeast Land), (14&nbsp;600 km<U+00B2>) and [[Edge<U+00F8>ya]] (Edge Island) (5000 km<U+00B2>). There is also the smaller [[Barents<U+00F8>ya]] (Barents Island) and a few other, smaller islands.

60% of Svalbard is covered by [[glacier|glaciation]] and snowfields. However, the [[North Atlantic Current]] moderates the Arctic climate ([[Geography of Norway#Climate|[1]]]), keeping the surrounding waters open and navigable most of the year ([http://met.no/kyst_og_hav/iskart.html updated ice maps]). The average Summer temperature is around 5 degrees celsius, and in winter, -12. The Western coast is considerably warmer than the east, due to the North Atlantic Drift. Svalbard lies far north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. In Longyearbyen, the [[midnight sun]] lasts from [[April 20]] to [[August 23]], and [[polar night]] lasts from [[October 26]] to [[February 15]]. 

Svalbard serves as the breeding ground for large numbers of seabirds, including [[Brunnich's Guillemot|Brunnich's]] and [[Black Guillemot]], [[Puffin]], [[Little Auk]], [[Fulmar]] and [[Kittiwake]]. Other seabirds include [[Arctic Tern]], four species of [[skua]], and the elusive [[Ivory Gull]]. The Svalbard [[Ptarmigan]], found on the larger islands, is the only landbird present for the entire year. Only two songbirds migrate to Svalbard to breed: the [[Snow Bunting]] and the [[Northern Wheatear|Wheatear]].

Four mammal species inhabit the archipelago: the Svalbard field mouse ''[[Microtus epiroticus]]'', the [[Arctic fox]], the Svalbard [[reindeer]] (a distinct sub-species), and [[polar bear]]s. Since polar bears occur very commonly on Svalbard, all people need to take precautions when outside the settlements: this includes carrying a [[rifle]]. Nevertheless, the law protects polar bears, forbidding anyone to harm or disturb them.

There is an astonishing variety of flowering plants on Svalbard. Although they are very small, these plants use the short period of 24-hour daylight to produce colourful blossoms. See also: [[Flowers of Svalbard]].

*[[Smeerenburg]] (Dutch settlement on northwestern Amsterdam Island, abandoned around 1660)
*[[Sveagruva, Svalbard|Sveagruva]] (population of 210)

No roads link the settlements on the island; transportation includes [[boat]], [[fixed-wing aircraft|plane]], [[helicopter]], and [[snowmobile]]. The gateway to Svalbard is through [[Svalbard Airport, Longyear]].

== Economy ==

Economic activity centres on [[coal mining]], supplemented by [[fishing]] and [[trapping]]. In the final decades of the [[20th century]], [[tourism]], [[research]], [[higher education]], and some high-tech enterprises like satellite relay-stations have grown significantly. A 200 [[nautical mile]] (370 km) Fisheries Protection Zone around Svalbard was established in 1977 pursuant to the Act of 17 December 1976 relating to the [[Exclusive Economic Zone|Economic Zone]] of Norway. Despite recent discussions, Russia and Norway dispute their maritime limits in the Barents Sea and Russia's fishing rights beyond Svalbard's territorial limits within the Svalbard Treaty zone.

The [[Svalbard Undersea Cable System]] which started operation in [[January 2004]] provides dual 1440&nbsp;km [[fiber optic]] lines from Svalbard to [[Harstad]] via [[And<U+00F8>y]], needed for communicating with [[polar orbit]]ing [[satellite]] stations on Svalbard, some owned by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), both United States government agencies.

The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services, and provides most of the local infrastructure.

== Coal mining in Svalbard ==

The first modern coal mine was opened in 1906 when the Arctic Coal Company (ACC) set up camp. The settlement that grew up around the mine was named after the American owner of ACC, John Munroe Longyear. However ACC sold out to the Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani (SNSK) in 1916, and over the next few years two other Norwegian companies set up operations on the southernmost island, Bj<U+00F8>rn<U+00F8>ya, and the Kings Bay Kull Compani opened a mine in Ny <U+00C5>lesund.

Mining came to a halt during WWII, and the islands were evacuated on the 3rd of September 1941. However the Germans did bomb Longyearbyen and the Barentsburg settlement in September 1943 and the settlement of Sveagruva the year after.

The Ny <U+00C5>lesund mine was closed down in 1963 after an explosion in 1962 when 21 lives were lost, and has since been converted to a scientific post.

[[As of 2006]], there are three operational coal mines in Svalbard.  There are large mines in Sveagruva (production 2 million [[tonne]]s per year, [http://www.snsk.no/internet/en/storenorske/selskapet.htm]) and Barentsburg, while the small mine in Longyearbyen is used mainly to supply the town's own power plant.

== Demographics ==

Svalbard has a population of approximately 2,800 people. 60% of the people are [[Norwegians|Norwegian]]; 40% are [[Russian people|Russian]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]. The official language of Svalbard is [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. [[Russian language|Russian]] is used in the Russian settlements, but formerly, [[Russenorsk language|Russenorsk]] was the ''lingua franca'' of the entire [[Barents Sea]] region.

== Svalbard in popular culture ==
Svalbard featured as the setting for much action in [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy.  A gateway was created there from which one could gain access to parallel universes. The Svalbard in the books is ruled by a race of sentient armored polar bears.
