This is a '''list of fictitious stories of the [[Chinese literature|Chinese novel]] ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'''''. The [[Three Kingdoms]] era is known as a very famous period in [[Chinese history]]. There are many famous people and stories in that era, as well as novels about it, being ''[[Romance of Three Kingdoms]]''(<U+4E09><U+56FD><U+6F14><U+4E49>) the most famous. This novel is one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels]]. Although ''Romance of Three Kingdoms'' is a novel, its polularity is the reason why many people think it is the real history of the Three Kingdoms period and therefor, historians use it to investigate said history, even though it is not true. Many stories in the novel are fictitious or made based on the other stories.

The story follows three famous people: [[Liu Bei]] (<U+5218><U+5907>), [[Guan Yu]] (<U+5173><U+7FBD>) and [[Zhang Fei]] (<U+5F20><U+98DE>), who become sworn brothers in a peach garden. However, in history, it is not mentioned that these three men have become sworn brothers, but that their relationship was as good as brothers.

{{main|Battle of Hulao Pass}}
Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei fought with [[L<U+00FC> Bu]] (<U+5415><U+5E03>) in this story called SanYingZhanL<U+00FC>Bu(<U+4E09><U+82F1><U+6218><U+5415><U+5E03>). This is a fictitious battle that makes Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei become famous in the country, since [[L<U+00FC> Bu]] was well known as the strongest warrior. However, Gong Sun Zan(<U+516C><U+5B59><U+74D2>) whom Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei belonged to didn<U+2019>t attend the alliance of punitive expedition against Dong Zhuo(<U+8463><U+5353>), whom L<U+00FC> Bu belonged to.

==Guan Yu's Escape==
{{main|Guan Yu#Crossing five passes and slaying six warriors}}

This story, called GuoWuGuanZhanLiuJiang (<U+8FC7><U+4E94><U+5173><U+65A9><U+516D><U+5C06>) talks about Guan Yu's escape from [[Cao Cao]] (<U+66F9><U+64CD>) to find Liu Bei and killed six generals when he passed five passes. In history, since the five passes were very far away to each other and Guan Yu went directly south back to Liu Bei, the story was not likely to happen and therefore, those five generals never existed. Historically, this escape was never executed.

==HuaRong Road (<U+534E><U+5BB9><U+9053>)==
In the novel, after the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] (<U+8D64><U+58C1><U+4E4B><U+6218>), there is a story called HuaRong Road(<U+534E><U+5BB9><U+9053>), which talks about Cao Cao trying to run to the north after losing the battle. The, Cao Cao came across Guan Yu, who allowed him to leave since Guan Yu used to serve for Cao Cao before. In history, the real person who came to intercept Cao Cao is Liu Bei, but he was late and let Cao Cao ran away.

==Guan Yu meets Lu Su==

Guan Yu went to meet [[Lu Su]] (<U+9C81><U+8083>),w ho served for [[Sun Quan]] (<U+5B59><U+6743>), the king of [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] (<U+5434>). But according to the history book, Wu Shu(<U+5434><U+4E66>)of Three Kingdoms Zhi(<U+4E09><U+56FD><U+5FD7>), it was Lu Su who went to meet Guan Yu by himself. 

==Three visits==
[[Zhuge Liang]] (<U+8BF8><U+845B><U+4EAE>) is one of the most famous person, both in history and in the novel. He served [[Liu Bei]]. In the novel, it is mentioned that after Liu Bei went to visit Zhuge Liang three times, Zhuge Liang agreed to serve him. However, according to what one of the most recognized Chinese historians, Professor Yi Zhong Tian (<U+6613><U+4E2D><U+5929>), wrote in his book Yi Zhong Tian Pin San Guo (<U+6613><U+4E2D><U+5929><U+54C1><U+4E09><U+56FD>), this story is totally opposite to the history. In history, it is Zhuge Liang who visited Liu Bei and introduced himself to Liu Bei.

==Borrow of arrows==
As Professor Yi Zhong Tian stated, the story of borrowing arrows during the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] never happened. This story actually happened in another dynasty, which is several hundreds of years later than the Three Kingdoms era. Besides, Zhuge Liang had never attended the alliance of Shu (<U+8700>) and Wu(<U+5434>), so it is impossible for him to meet Zhou Yu (<U+5468><U+745C>).

==Shu against Nanman==
There is a famous battle between Shu and the [[Nanman]] (<U+5357><U+86EE>), which were rebel tribes in southwestern [[China]]. In this battle, Zhuge Liang had caught and released Meng Huo (<U+5B5F><U+83B7>), leader of Nanman, seven times. However, there are no records about this battle in any historical sources.

==Zhuge Liang against Zhou Yu==
In this story, Zhou Yu was irritated by Zhuge Liang. This was not possible, since they never met each other in history and Zhou Yu was a magnanimous person, who died because of excessive tiredness .

==Zhao Yun==
In the novel, Zhao Yun(<U+8D75><U+4E91>)<U+FF0C>known as one of the five generals of Shu, never lost a battle in his life. Historically, he is a normal general who didn<U+2019>t have any special combat success.
