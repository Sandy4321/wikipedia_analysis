The '''Radioplane RP-77''' was a small [[target drone]] missile, constructed largely of plastic materials, produced by the [[Radioplane]] division of the [[Northrop Corporation]]. Although the RP-77D was successfully tested by the United States Army, the decision was made not to procure the aircraft.

==Design and development==
The development of the RP-77 began in 1955.<ref name="DS">Parsch 2004.</ref> Similar in outline to Radioplane's earlier [[Radioplane OQ-19|OQ-19]], four prototypes of the RP-77 were constructed, two each of the RP-77, powered by a four-cylinder [[McCulloch Motors Corporation|McCulloch]] [[piston engine]], and of the RP-77A, powered by a six-cylinder [[Lycoming]] engine.<ref name="DS"/> Results of flight-testing were insufficient to interest the U.S. Army, however in 1957 a proposal for an improved RP-77D, powered by a [[Boeing 502]] [[turboprop]], resulted in a contract for the construction of 20 aircraft.<ref name="DS"/>

The design of the RP-77D made extensive use of glass-polyester plastic materials.<ref>Merrill 1956, p.108.</ref><ref>Duffin 1958, p.160.</ref> The drone was launched using a [[rocket-assisted take-off]] system consisting of four [[Loki (rocket)|Loki]] rockets, and was fitted with a [[radio control]] apparatus that, with the assistance of [[radar]] tracking, allowed the drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point.<ref name="DS"/> In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] or [[meteorological]] sensors, or with air sampling equipment.<ref name="DS"/> The RP-77D utilised the [[RPTA (control)|RPTA]] tracking system, developed by Radioplane, using audio frequency tones for control.<ref>Interavia p. 359</ref> Tip tanks allowed for carriage of additional fuel to extend the aircraft's range, and recovery at the end of the flight was by parachute.<ref name="AJ">''Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society'', Volume LXIII, January-December 1959, [http://books.google.com/books?ei=yekYTZP-BoSq8AbQ9dXwDQ&ct=result&id=eUASAAAAIAAJ&dq=Radioplane+RP-77+%22Aeronautical+Journal%22&q=Radioplane+RP-77#search_anchor p.165].</ref>

An improved version of the RP-77D was projected, with provision for launching [[Northrop AQM-38|RP-76]] target missiles.<ref name="DS"/>

==Operational history==
Following its maiden flight in March of 1958, evaluation of the RP-77D by the U.S. Army took place throughout the remainder of that year, nearly 40 test flights being conducted.<ref name="DS"/> Although the test results were generally satisfactory, it was determined that the performance of the aircraft was an insufficient improvement over existing types in service to have the aircraft ordered into production, and the project was cancelled, along with the improved RP-86, a dedicated reconnaissance variant.<ref name="DS"/>

Following the termination of the Army's evaluation, Radioplane, as a private venture, conducted an improvement program for the RP-77D, fitting the aircraft with a larger wing, along with other modifications that improved the performance of the drone. However these improvements were insufficient to produce a renewed interest from the Army.<ref name="DS"/>
