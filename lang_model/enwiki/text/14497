'''Hither Green marshalling yard''', is a large railway [[marshalling yard]] designed for the concentration of [[freight]] traffic to and from South East London, and for transfer to other yards in London.  It is situated on the north side of the [[South Eastern Main Line]] between [[Hither Green railway station|Hither Green]] and [[Grove Park railway station|Grove Park]] stations. The facility was conceived and built by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]] after 1895, but by the time it opened in 1899 this railway had become part of the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]].

==History==
Freight traffic was considered to be of minor importance for much of the existence of the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]], but during the early 1890s the situation began to change.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=D. L.|title=Locomotives of the South Eastern Railway|page=81|publisher=Railway Correspondence and Travel Society|year=1963}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=D. L.|title=Locomotives of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway|page=8|publisher=Railway Correspondence and Travel Society|year=1980}}</ref> A growth in freight traffic was experienced to and from London, Kent and the Continent, and also for transfer to other railways in the north of England. This traffic was beginning to overwhelm the existing facilities at [[Bricklayers Arms]]  which was also poorly sited with respect to transfer freight using the [[East London Line]]. Following the opening of [[Hither Green railway station]] in 1895 plans were therefore made for the construction of a new [[marshaling yard]] nearby. This location gave excellent access to the [[South Eastern Main Line]] and also had a connection with the [[Dartford Loop Line]]. It provided easy links to the neighbouring [[London Brighton and South Coast Railway]], and the [[Great Eastern Railway|Great Eastern]], [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern]], and [[Midland Railway|Midland]] Railways via [[East London Line]]. The new facility opened in 1899 after the formation of  the [[South Eastern and Chatham Railway]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Body|first=Geoffrey|title=PSL Field Guide to Railways  of the Southern Region|page=110|publisher=Patrick Stephens|year=1989|isbn=185260297X}}|</ref>

The yard passed in to [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] (SR) ownership in 1923 and fulfilled an important part in its plans for the re-organisation of freight traffic in South London, and connections  with other railways. New junctions were created  in the period 1927-1933.<ref>{{cite book| last=Marshall| first=C. F. Dendy| title=History of the Southern Railway| edition=2nd (revised)| year=1963| publisher=Ian Allan Ltd| location=London| page=406}}</ref> During the [[Second World War]] the rail yard was also a frequent target of enemy action.

The yards passed into [[British Railways]] ownership in 1948, and in 1960 a new freight depot opened south of St Mildreds Road, handling at its peak over two million tonnes a year of continental fruit and vegetables.<ref>http://hidden-london.com/gazetteer/hither-green</ref> The yard was partially closed during the 1990s with some of the sidings used for storing condemned [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/deepgreen2009/tags/hithergreen/ photographs]</ref> The yard remained in use by stone traffic and engineers' trains in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| website=RailUK Forums| title=UK Railway Forums/Infrastructure & Stations| url=http://www.railforums.co.uk/showthread.php?t=25015}}</ref>

==Motive power depot==
The Southern Railway  opened a new [[motive power depot]] to the south of the station in 1933.<ref>{{cite book| last=Griffiths| first=Roger| last2=Smith| first2=Paul| title=The directory of British engine sheds and principal locomotive servicing points: 1.
