An '''exempt charity''' is an institution established in [[England and Wales]] for [[Charitable organization|charitable purposes]] which is exempt from registration with, and oversight by, the [[Charity Commission]]. 

Exempt charities are largely institutions of further and higher education, universities, student unions, [[Industrial and Provident Society|Industrial and Provident Societies]], [[Friendly society|Friendly Societies]], or national museums, that were established by Act of Parliament or by Royal Charter. These organisations are specified in Schedule 2 to the Charities Act 1993.<ref>[http://www.uk-charities-act-1993.co.uk/s-E Charities Act 1993, Schedule 2]</ref>

Historically, they were treated as exempt from supervision because they were considered to be adequately supervised by, or accountable to, some other body or authority, such as Parliament. 

Although outside the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission, they are still subject to the usual legal rules applicable to charities in [[English law]] and to the general provisions of the Charities Acts.

The [[Charities Act 2006]] substantially changed the law on exempt charities, introducing the requirement of a "principal regulator" to oversee the compliance of the charity with charity law.
