'''''The Shooting Star''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''L'<U+00C9>toile myst<U+00E9>rieuse'''}}) is the tenth volume of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the comics series by Belgian cartoonist [[Herg<U+00E9>]]. It was the first volume published in what was to become the series' standard 62-page full colour format, after first being serialised from October 1941 to May 1942 in black-and-white in Belgium's leading newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[Le Soir]]''}} during the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II]]. The story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], who travels with his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] and friend [[Captain Haddock]] aboard a scientific expedition to the [[Arctic Ocean]] on an international race to find a [[meteorite]] that has fallen to the Earth.

''The Shooting Star'' was a commercial success and was published in book form by [[Casterman]] shortly after its conclusion. Herg<U+00E9> continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'', while the series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]]. ''The Shooting Star'' has received a mixed critical reception and has been one of the most controversial instalments in the series due to the alleged [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] portrayal of its villain. The story was adapted for both the 1957 [[Belvision Studios|Belvision]] animated series, ''[[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin]]'', and for the 1991 animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' by [[Ellipse Programm<U+00E9>|Ellipse]] and [[Nelvana]].

==Synopsis==
A giant [[meteoroid]] approaches the earth, spotted from an observatory by [[Professor Decimus Phostle]], while a self-proclaimed prophet, [[Philippulus the prophet|Philippulus]], predicts the end of the world. The meteoroid misses the earth, but a fragment of it plunges into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Phostle determines that the object is made of a new material which he names Phostlite, and sets off to find it with a crew of European scientists. Accompanied by Tintin and Snowy, their ship, the ''Aurora'', is helmed by Tintin's friend [[Captain Haddock]].{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1942|pp=1<U+2013>14}}

Unknown to the ''Aurora'' expedition, another team has already set out aboard the polar expedition ship ''Peary'', backed by a financier from S<U+00E3>o Rico, [[Mr. Bohlwinkel]]. The expedition becomes a race to land on the [[meteorite]], which is now floating in the sea. Bohlwinkel attempts to sabotage the ''Aurora'' expedition by having a henchman plant a stick of [[dynamite]] on the ship on the eve of departure, but it is found and thrown overboard. While crossing the [[North Sea]], the ''Aurora'' is almost rammed by another of Bohlwinkel's ships, but Haddock manages to steer out of the way. Further setbacks occur at the Icelandic port of [[Akureyri]], when Haddock is informed that there is no fuel available. He is furious, but he and Tintin come across an old friend of his, [[Captain Chester]], who reveals that there is plenty of fuel and that the Golden Oil Company (which has a fuel monopoly) is owned by Bohlwinkel. The three devise a plan to run a hose from Chester's ship, ''Sirius'', to the ''Aurora'' and thus trick Golden Oil into providing them with the fuel they need.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1942|pp=15<U+2013>28}}

Coming close to catching the ''Peary'', the ''Aurora'' receives an indistinct distress call from another ship and alters its course to help. Inquiries by Tintin lead him to realise that the distress signal is a decoy to delay them. Resuming the journey, they intercept a cable announcing that the ''Peary'' expedition has reached the meteorite but not yet claimed it. While the ''Peary'' crew rows to the meteorite, Tintin uses the ''Aurora'''s [[seaplane]] to parachute onto the meteorite and plant the expedition flag, beating the crew of the ''Peary'' by seconds.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1942|pp=29<U+2013>40}}

Tintin makes camp while the ''Aurora''{{'}}s engines are repaired. The next day he discovers that Phostlite advances the ageing process and makes things much larger: his apple core grows into a large tree while a maggot grows into a huge butterfly. Tintin is menaced by a giant spider and huge, exploding mushrooms before rescue arrives. A sudden [[seaquake]] shakes the meteorite to its core and it sinks into the sea, just as Tintin and Snowy escape to the ''Aurora''.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|1942|pp=41<U+2013>62}}

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Ar 196 being loaded on Admiral Hipper cruiser 1941.jpg|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photo of a seaplane surrounded by people|A German [[Arado Ar 196|Arado 196]] seaplane used by Herg<U+00E9> as inspiration for the type used by Tintin in the book]]

Amid the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]] during [[World War II]], Herg<U+00E9> found employment at ''[[Le Soir]]'', Belgium's leading newspaper, then under the administrative control of the occupying [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|military government]].{{efn|{{lang|fr|''Le Soir''}} as published during the occupation was known by Belgians as {{lang|fr|''Le Soir vol<U+00E9>''}} (''The Stolen Soir'') as it was published without the approval of its original owners, [[Rossel (company)|Rossel & Cie]], who regained ownership after the Liberation.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=70|2a1=Couvreur|2y=2012}} }} ''The Shooting Star'' initially featured the United States as the primary antagonists; explaining this, Herg<U+00E9> later asserted that the story revolved around the theme of "the rivalry for progress between Europe and the United States".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=132}} Although not disliking Americans themselves, he had a strong disdain for American [[big business]],{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=107}} and had exhibited anti-American themes in earlier works, in particular in ''[[Tintin in America]]''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=51}} During serialisation of ''The Shooting Star'', in December 1941, the U.S. entered the war on the side of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], thus coming into direct conflict with Germany.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=81}} All of the scientists featured were from [[Axis powers|Axis]] or [[Neutral powers during World War II|neutral countries]], which might be a reflection of the strip's anti-Allies political slant.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=107|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=100|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=50}} Entertainment producer and author [[Harry Thompson]] stated this should not be interpreted as a strong anti-Ally bias, for the only two nation-states in Europe that were part of the Allies at that point were the [[Soviet Union]] and United Kingdom, and that the characters of Haddock and Chester were British.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=107}}

As he had done for other ''Adventures of Tintin'' which featured sea travel, Herg<U+00E9> was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible in order to make his portrayals more realistic. The design of the ''Aurora'' was based on the [[RRS William Scoresby|RRS ''William Scoresby'']], while that of the ''Peary'' was most likely based upon another [[Antarctic]] ship, the [[RRS Discovery|RRS ''Discovery'']].{{sfn|Nyg<U+00E5>rd|2013|pp=120<U+2013>128}} The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German [[Arado Ar 196|Arado 196-A]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=50|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=100|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=133}} Herg<U+00E9> nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if ''Aurora'' had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=110|2a1=Peeters|2y=1989|2p=71}}

''The Shooting Star'' shared plot similarities with ''[[The Chase of the Golden Meteor]]'', a 1908 novel by pioneering French [[science-fiction]] writer [[Jules Verne]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=49}} As in Herg<U+00E9>'s story, Verne's novel features an expedition to the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Herg<U+00E9>'s Professor Schulze<U+2014>both from the [[University of Jena]]. Herg<U+00E9> denied deliberately copying Verne's story, saying that he had only read one of the French novelist's works; it is possible that the influence from Verne came via [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]], Herg<U+00E9>'s friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=49}} The Swedish expedition member Eric Bj<U+00F6>rgenskj<U+00F6>ld physically resembles a real person: [[Auguste Piccard]], who later became Herg<U+00E9>'s inspiration for [[Professor Calculus]].{{sfn|Remy|2012|p=22}}

===Anti-Semitism===

{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="All I actually did was show a villainous financier with a Semitic appearance and a Jewish name: Blumenstein, in ''The Shooting Star''. But does that mean there was anti-Semitism on my part? It seems to me that in my entire panoply of bad guys there are all sorts; I have shown a lot of "villains" of various origins, without any particular treatment of this or that race... We've always told Jewish stories, Marseillaise stories, Scottish stories. But who could have predicted that the Jewish stories would end as we know now that they did, in the death camps of [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]?"|source=Herg<U+00E9> to [[Numa Sadoul]]{{sfnm|1a1=Sadoul|1y=1975|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=134}} }}

Under Nazi control, ''Le Soir'' was publishing a variety of [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] articles, calling for the Jews to be further excluded from public life and describing them as racial enemies of the [[Belgians|Belgian people]].{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=82|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=134}} Herg<U+00E9> biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] noted that there was a "remarkable correlation" between the anti-Semitic nature of ''Le Soir''{{'s}} editorials and ''The Shooting Star''{{'s}} depiction of Jews.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=81}} Within months of the story's publication, legislation was passed to [[The Holocaust in Belgium|collect and deport Jews from Belgium]] to [[Nazi concentration camps]].{{sfn|Frey|2008|pp=28<U+2013>30}} Thus, ''The Shooting Star'' reflected trends in the Belgian political situation at the time.{{sfn|Frey|2008|pp=28<U+2013>30}} However, the story was not the first time that Herg<U+00E9> had adopted such a perspective in his work; he had recently provided illustrations for [[Robert de Vroyland]]'s ''Fables'', a number of which contained [[Stereotypes of Jews|anti-Semitic stereotypes]], reflecting the racism in much of de Vroyland's book.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=131<U+2013>132}} Similarly, his depiction of the character of [[Rastapopoulos]], who was introduced in ''[[Tintin in America]]'', has been cited as being based upon anti-Semitic stereotypes.{{sfn|Frey|2008|p=33}}

When ''The Shooting Star'' appeared in ''Le Soir'', Herg<U+00E9> featured a gag in which two Jews hear the prophetic news that the end of the world is near. They rub their hands together in eagerness, and one comments: "Did you hear, Isaac? The end of the world! What if it's true?" The other responds: "Hey, hey, it vould be a gut ding, Solomon! I owe my suppliers 50,000 [[Belgian franc|francs]], and zis way I von't haf to pay vem!" Herg<U+00E9> omitted this scene from the collected edition.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=49|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=133}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-00011, Ausstellung PK Belgien.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-Semitic and anti-English propaganda on display in an exhibition in Brussels in 1941]]
The character of Blumenstein displays anti-Semitic stereotypes, such as having a bulbous nose and being an avaricious, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] businessman.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1p=81|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=133}} Herg<U+00E9> later dismissed concerns over this Jewish caricature, saying, "That was the style then."{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=81}} In his assessment of Franco-Belgian comics, Matthew Screech expressed the opinion that Blumenstein was an [[Stereotypes of Americans|anti-American stereotype]] rather than an anti-Jewish one.{{sfn|Screech|2005}} Similarly, reporter and Tintin expert [[Michael Farr]] asserted that Blumenstein was "more parodied as a financier than Jew".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=100}} Conversely, [[Lofficier and Lofficier]] asserted that both anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism were present, and that it is the United States and [[International Jewry]] who were the "ruthless opponents" of Tintin.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=50}} Nazi apologists and revisionists such as French [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[Olivier Mathieu]] used ''The Shooting Star'' as evidence that Herg<U+00E9> was an anti-Semite with Nazi sympathies.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=59}}

To graphic novel specialist Hugo Frey, the competing expeditions are presented as a simplistic race between good and evil, wherein Blumestein displays the stereotypes of Jews held by advocates of the [[Jewish World Conspiracy]] presented in works such as the anti-Semitic ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''. Frey writes that Blumenstein's "large and bulbous nose&nbsp;... rounded forehead, receding black hair, and small beady eyes" were stock anti-Semitic imagery in the 1930s and 1940s, as promoted by those such as journalist [[<U+00C9>douard Drumont]], whose anti-Semitic Paris-based newspaper ''[[La Libre Parole]]'' was influential in Brussels.{{sfn|Frey|2008|p=28}} According to Frey, Blumenstein's depiction as an overweight cigar-smoker reflected the anti-Semitic stereotype of Jews as being financially powerful,{{sfn|Frey|2008|p=29}} while he suggested that the scene in which Blumenstein learned that he was to be tracked down for his crimes recalled the contemporary roundup of Jews in Nazi Europe.{{sfn|Frey|2008|p=30}} Frey contrasts Herg<U+00E9>'s complicity with the anti-Semites to the actions of others Belgians, such as those who struck against the Nazis at the ''[[Free University of Brussels|Universit<U+00E9> libre de Bruxelles]]'' and those who risked their lives to hide Jews.{{sfn|Frey|2008|p=30}}

''The Shooting Star'' was serialized daily in {{lang|fr|''Le Soir''}} from 20 October 1941 to 21 May 1942{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=48|2a1=Frey|2y=2008|2p=28|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=80}} in French under the title {{lang|fr|''L'<U+00C9>toile myst<U+00E9>rieuse''}} (''The Mysterious Star'').{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=99}} Tintin's previous adventure, ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'', had been serialized weekly until the demise of {{lang|fr|''Le Soir''}}'s children's supplement, {{lang|fr|''Le Soir Jeunesse''}}, before continuing daily in the main newspaper itself; the earlier serial had ended the day before ''The Shooting Star'' began.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=99|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=86}} ''The Shooting Star'' was the first ''Tintin'' adventure to be serialized daily in its entirety.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=99}} As with earlier ''Adventures of Tintin'', the story was later serialised in France in the Catholic newspaper ''[[C<U+0153>urs Vaillants]]'', where it first appeared on 6 June 1943.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=48}}

On page 20 of the published book, Herg<U+00E9> included a cameo of the characters [[Thomson and Thompson]] and [[Quick & Flupke]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=50}} The story also introduced Captain Chester, who is mentioned in later adventures, and [[Professor Cantonneau]], who returns in ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=109|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=99|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=49}}

On 21 May 1942, ''The Shooting Star'' concluded serialisation. Less than a week later, the occupied government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would have to wear a [[yellow badge]] on their clothing, and in July the [[Gestapo]] began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and [[extermination camp]]s, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed.{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=81<U+2013>82|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=135}} Herg<U+00E9> later recalled: "I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally I did see some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away. I didn't want to believe it."{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=135}}

The earlier ''Tintin'' albums reproduced the newspaper strips, which had come to appear weekly in Thursday supplements, two-page allotments of three tiers to a page. War shortages reduced the space for the strip by a third, and later the supplements disappeared completely; the comic appeared daily in the main newspaper as a four-panel strip. For publication in book form, [[Casterman]] insisted that Herg<U+00E9> must adhere to a new album format of four sixteen-page signatures, which gave sixty-two pages of story plus a cover page. Though the format reduced the page count, it maintained the same amount of story by reducing the size of the panels reproduced. As ''The Shooting Star'' progressed, Herg<U+00E9> cut up and laid out clippings of the strip in an exercise book in preparation for the new layouts.{{sfn|Taylor|2009}} It was the first volume of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' to be conceived in the 62-page full-colour format that thereafter was the series standard.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=108|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=48}} [[Casterman]] published the album in September 1942.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=48|2a1=Frey|2y=2008|2p=28}} Unlike the previous books in the series, because it was printed immediately in colour, it did not need to be totally redrawn.{{sfn|Remy|2012|p=23}} The 176 daily strips from the original serialization were not enough to fill the 62 pages Casterman had allotted, so Herg<U+00E9> added large panels, such as a half-page panel of a giant telescope on page three.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=100}} Herg<U+00E9> wanted to include a small gold star inside the "o" of "<U+00C9>toile" on the cover page, but Casterman refused, deeming it too expensive.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=83}}

In 1954, Herg<U+00E9> began making various changes to the story for its re-publication. Aware of the controversy surrounding the anti-Semitic depiction of Blumenstein, he renamed the character "Bolhwinkel", adopting this name from {{lang|nl|''bollewinkel''}}, a Brussels dialect term for a [[confectionery store]]. He later discovered that, by coincidence, Bolhwinkel was also a Jewish name.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=108|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=100|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=49|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=135}} Trying to tone down the book's anti-American sentiment, he also changed the United States to a [[fictional country|fictional South American nation]] called S<U+00E3>o Rico, substituting the U.S. flag flown by the ''Peary''{{'}}s crew to that of the fictional state.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1pp=107<U+2013>108|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=100|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=49|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=135}} In 1959, Herg<U+00E9> made a new list of changes to be made to the artwork in ''The Shooting Star'', which included altering Bohlwinkel's nose, but the changes were postponed and have never been made.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=135}}

==Critical analysis==

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="''The Shooting Star'' remains to this day a blot on Herg<U+00E9>'s record. How did the man who had so eloquently defended the Native Americans in ''Tintin in America'' and the Chinese in ''The Blue Lotus'', who only three years before denounced fascism in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'', become a propagandist for the Axis remains hard to understand. It did not have to be that way."|source=Randy and [[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] {{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=50}} }}

Pierre Assouline remarked that Herg<U+00E9>'s attention to accuracy lapsed in ''The Shooting Star''. For instance, the meteorite's approach toward Earth caused a heat wave, while the meteorite itself proceeded to float on the surface of the ocean. In reality, no such heat wave would have been caused, while the meteorite would have plunged to the sea floor, causing a [[tsunami]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=81}} He noted that the concept of madness was a recurring theme throughout the story, and that there was "an unreality in the whole adventure".{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=81}} Fellow biographer [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] asserted that ''The Shooting Star'' was "of great power and brilliant construction".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=132}} Elsewhere, Peeters wrote that the book was "notable for the entry of the fantastic into Herg<U+00E9>'s work".{{sfn|Peeters|1989|p=70}}

Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier deemed the anti-Semitism a "sad moment" in the series, awarding the story one out of five stars.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=51}} Nevertheless, they felt that the "pre-apocalyptic ambiance is stark and believable", and that the giant mushrooms on the meteorite were a "strange anticipation" of the mushroom-clouds produced by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings in 1945]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=50}} Focusing on the characters of Professor Phostle and Philippulus, they asserted that both resembled [[Sophocles Sarcophagus]] from ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' and that the former was "in the Jules Verne tradition" of eccentric professors.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=48<U+2013>49}} According to philosopher [[Pascal Bruckner]], Tintin experts find Philippulus a caricature of Marshal of France [[Philippe P<U+00E9>tain]], who demanded the French repent imaginary sins when he took power.{{sfn|Bruckner|2013|p=63}} [[Philippe Goddin]] stated that the strips for this story "kept the reader daily on tenterhooks in a story replete with new twists and humour".{{sfn|Goddin|2009|p=92}}

Harry Thompson described ''The Shooting Star'' as "the most important of all Herg<U+00E9>'s wartime stories", having "an air of bizarre fantasy" that was unlike his prior work.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=106}} He observed that the character of Professor Phostle was a prototype for Professor Calculus, introduced later in the series.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=109}} Michael Farr asserted that the apocalyptic setting of the story reflected the wartime mood in Europe.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=99}} He characterises the opening pages of the story as being "unique in {{interp|Herg<U+00E9>'s|original=his}} work for the feeling of foreboding they convey", adding that "Herg<U+00E9> daringly eschews the strip cartoonist's recognised means of denoting a dream, deliberately confusing the reader".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=99}} He felt that the "flow of the narrative is less accomplished" than in other stories, with "spurts and rushes followed by slower passages, upsetting the rhythm and pace".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=103}}

Literary critic [[Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s]] psychoanalysed ''The Shooting Star'', describing it as "the final attempt of the foundling [i.e. Tintin] to rid himself of the bastard [i.e. Haddock] and to preserve the integrity of his former values", pointing out that the first thirteen pages are devoted purely to the boy reporter.{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=126}} He also argued that Phostle and Philippus represent two halves of "an ambivalent father figure" within the story, with the former prefiguring Calculus "more than any other previous character".{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=127}} He suggests that when hiding on the ''Aurora'', Philippus can be compared to [[The Phantom of the Opera]], as he steals a stick of dynamite and climbs up the ship's mast before threatening to detonate the weapon.{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=129}} Apostolid<U+00E8>s believed that the shooting star itself is "more a religious mystery than a scientific one" and that Tintin is therefore "the perfect one to figure it out in some religious way<U+2014>that is, unrealistically".{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=127}} Apostolid<U+00E8>s analysed the political component of the story in terms of "the incarnation of unregulated capitalism against the spirit of European values", arguing that Herg<U+00E9> was adhering to "a utopian vision that, in 1942, smacks of pro-German propaganda".{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=133}}

Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]] believed that ''The Shooting Star'' represents the apex of the "right-wing strain" in Herg<U+00E9>'s work.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=38}} He highlighted the instance in which Tintin impersonates God in order to give commands to Philippus as representing one of various occasions in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' where "sacred authority manifests itself largely as a ''voice'', and commanding<U+2014>or commandeering<U+2014>that voice is what guarantees power".{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=52}} McCarthy further observes that the image of a giant spider in a ball of fire, which appears near the start of the story, reflects the theme of madness that is again present throughout the series.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=81}} Discussing the political elements of Herg<U+00E9>'s series, McCarthy also noted that in the original publication of the story, the spider which climbed in front of the observatory telescope and was thus magnified greatly was initially termed ''Aranea Fasciata''; he saw this as an intentional satire of the threat to Europe posed by fascism.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=40}}

==Adaptations==

In 1957, the animation company [[Belvision Studios]] produced [[Herg<U+00E9>'s Adventures of Tintin|a string of colour adaptations]] based on Herg<U+00E9>'s original comics, adapting eight of the ''Adventures'' into a series of daily five-minute episodes. ''The Shooting Star'' was the sixth to be adapted in the second animated series; it was directed by Ray Goossens and written by [[Greg (cartoonist)|Greg]], a well-known cartoonist who was to become editor-in-chief of ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|pp=87<U+2013>88}}

In 1991, a [[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|second animated series]] based upon ''The Adventures of Tintin'' was produced, this time as a collaboration between the French studio [[Ellipse]] and the Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]]. ''The Shooting Star'' was the eighth story to be adapted and was divided into two twenty-minute episodes. Directed by St<U+00E9>phane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being "generally faithful" to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Herg<U+00E9>'s original panels.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}}

In 2010, American cartoonist [[Charles Burns (cartoonist)|Charles Burns]] authored ''X'ed Out'', a [[graphic novel]] with a variety of allusions to ''The Adventures of Tintin''. In one scene, the protagonist Nitnit discovers a warehouse containing white eggs with red spots, akin to the mushrooms in ''The Shooting Star'',{{sfn|Schwartz|2010}} with the cover of Burns' book paying homage to Herg<U+00E9>.{{sfn|Das|2012}}
