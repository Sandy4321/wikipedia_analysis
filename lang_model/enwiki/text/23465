The '''Carlton Centre''' is a [[skyscraper]] and shopping centre located in downtown [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. At {{Convert|222.5|m|ft}}, it has been the tallest building in [[Africa]] for 38 years. The Carlton Centre has 50 floors. The foundations of the two buildings in the complex are 3.5m in diameter and extend 20m down to the bedrock, 30m below street level. The building houses both offices and shops, and has over 46 per cent of the floor area below ground level.<ref name="official-about">{{cite web|url=http://carlton-centre.co.za/index.php|title=About Carlton Centre|publisher=[[Transnet]]|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> A viewing deck on the 50th floor offers views of Johannesburg and [[Pretoria]].

The Carlton Centre is linked to the Carlton Hotel by a below ground shopping centre with over 180 shops as well as an ice skating rink all set below an above ground public plaza<ref>http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=carltoncentreofficetower-johannesburg-southafrica/ Carlton Centre Office Tower, Johannesburg|emporis.com</ref>.

==History==

The Carlton Centre was designed by the American architectural firm [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]]. [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American Properties]] began construction in the late 1960s by demolishing the old Carlton Hotel and the closing roads to form a city superblock.<ref name="official-history">{{cite web|url=http://carlton-centre.co.za/history.php|title=History|publisher=[[Transnet]]|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> Excavations for the Carlton were started in January 1967, and took two years to complete. This was done for the pilons that would eventually driven into the ground to support the new structure. Although occupation of the Centre began in 1971, it was not until 1974 that most of the construction was completed - at a cost of over R88 million<ref>http://www.amethyst.co.za/jhblandmarks/ Johannesburg Landmarks</ref>.   The building was officially opened in 1973.<ref name="official-history"/>

The building is the head office of transport parastatal [[Transnet]], which has owned the complex since 1999.
In June 2007 [[Maria Ramos]], Transnet group chief executive revealed Transnet's intention to offer the building for sale. The Carlton Centre has been serving as Transnet's headquarters since 2000, when the parastatal purchased it for ZAR R32 million from Anglo American Properties. The disposal of the property forms part of Transnet's restructuring program which includes the disposal of non-core assets. 

Although Transnet has given no indication of the price, the replacement cost of the building has been estimated at ZAR R1.5 billion.<ref>[http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&ArticleID=1518-24_2132870 Carlton Centre up for sale: South Africa: News: Companies: Fin24<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The high crime rate in the downtown area of Johannesburg encouraged many of the building's former tenants to relocate to more secure locations. The adjoining Carlton Hotel Y-shaped sister building has been closed-down and abandoned since 1997 due to low occupancy associated with urban decay of the city centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joburgnews.co.za/2004/oct/oct4_sars.stm|title=Sars moves to Carlton Centre|date=2004-10-24|publisher=City of Johannesburg|accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> The Carlton Centre itself remains in use however.<ref>[http://dojcarltonhotel.blogspot.com/ Death of Johannesburg: The Carlton Hotel ]</ref>.
