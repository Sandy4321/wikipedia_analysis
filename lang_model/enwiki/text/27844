The '''European Parliament''' (Europarl or EP) is the directly elected parliamentary body of the [[European Union]]. Together with the [[Council of the European Union]] (the Council), it forms the [[bicameral]] [[Institutions of the European Union#Legislature|legislative branch of the]] [[Institutions of the European Union|Union's institutions]] and has been described by some as one of the most powerful legislatures in the world.<ref name="Farrell Powerful"/>

The Parliament, together with the Council, form the highest legislative body within the Union. This is only within the competencies of the [[European Community]] being limited to specific policy areas, however [[European Union law|Union law]] does override national law. The Parliament is composed of 785 MEPs ([[Member of the European Parliament]]) who serve the second largest democratic electorate in the world (after [[India]]) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (492 million).<ref>{{cite web|title = Parliament - an overview. Welcome|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public.do?language=en|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

It has been directly elected, every five years by [[universal suffrage]], since 1979. Although the European Parliament has legislative power that such bodies as those above do not possess, it does not have [[legislative initiative]] like most national parliaments. While it is the "first institution" of the European Union (mentioned first in the treaties, having ceremonial precedence over all authority at European level<ref>{{cite web|title = Parliament's Protocol Service - mission impossible?|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-9981-205-07-30-901-20060728FCS09980-24-07-2006-2006/default_p001c001_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref>), the Council has greater powers over legislation than the Parliament where [[European Union legislative procedure|codecision procedure]] (equal rights of amendment and rejection) doesn't apply. It has however had control over the [[EU budget]] since the 1970s and has a veto over the appointment of the [[European Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref>

The [[President of the European Parliament]] (its [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]) is currently [[Hans-Gert P<U+00F6>ttering]] ([[European Peoples Party|EPP]]), elected in January 2007. He presides over a multi-party chamber, the two largest groups being the [[European People's Party-European Democrats]] (EPP-ED) and the [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES). The last Union-wide elections were the [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 Parliamentary Elections]], however [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] joined in 2007 and [[European Parliament election, 2007|are electing their members this year]]. The European Parliament has two meeting places. At the [[Buildings of the European Parliament#Brussels|"Espace L<U+00E9>opold/Leopoldwijk"]] complex in [[Brussels]] and in [[Buildings of the European Parliament#Strasbourg|Immeuble Louise Weiss]] in [[Strasbourg]], but it is mostly based in the former complex. The cost of this has been of concern to some. The [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]], the Parliament's administrative body, is based in [[Luxembourg]].<ref name="Consolidated Treaty">{{cite web|title = Consolidated versions of the treaty on European Union and of the treaty establishing the European Community|publisher = [[Europa (web portal)|Eur-lex]]|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/ce321/ce32120061229en00010331.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref name="Wallstr<U+00F6>m Blog">{{cite web|last = Wallstr<U+00F6>m | first = Margot|authorlink=Margot Wallstr<U+00F6>m|title = My blog: Denmark, Latvia, Strasbourg|date=[[2006-05-24]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Commission]]|url=http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/blog_wallstrom/page/wallstrom?entry=denmark_latvia_strasbourg|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

== History ==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
{{main|History of the European Parliament}}
The Parliament, like the other institutions, was not designed in its current form when it first met on [[10 September]] [[1952]]. One of the oldest common institutions it began as the "Common Assembly" of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). It was a consultative assembly of 78 parliamentarians drawn from the national parliaments of member states, having no legislative powers. Its development since then is testament to the evolution of the Union's structures without one clear "master plan". Some such as Tom Reid<!--Do not link, Wikipedia Tom Reid is an ice hockey player--> of the [[Washington Post]] said of the Union; "nobody would have deliberately designed a government as complex and as redundant as the EU". Even the Parliament's two seats, which have switched several times, is a result of various agreements or lack of agreements.<ref name="ENA History">{{cite web|title = European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3998|accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = EPP-ED Chronology - 1951-1960|publisher=[[European People's Party]]|url=http://www.epp-ed.eu/group/en/chronology02.asp|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Tom|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=The United States of Europe|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|date=2004|location=London|pages=272|url=|doi=|id=|isbn=0-141-02317-1}}</ref>

The Common Assembly renamed itself the "European Parliamentary Assembly" with the creation of the [[European Economic Community]] and [[Euratom]] in March 1958. It served all three communities, while the Commission and Council has separate bodies for each. The three merged in 1967 and the body was again renamed to the current "European Parliament" in 1962. In 1971 the parliament's membership was expanded again and its members were [[Elections in the European Union|directly elected]] for the [[European Parliament election, 1979|first time in 1979]]. This set it apart from similar institutions such as those of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] Assembly or [[Pan-African Parliament]] which are appointed. After that first election, the parliament held its first session on [[11 July]] [[1979]] electing [[Simone Veil]] as its President. Veil was also the first female President of the Parliament. Thereafter the membership of the European Parliament has simply expanded whenever new nations have joined; the membership was adjusted upwards in 1994 after [[German reunification]]. Recent treaties, including the [[Treaty of Nice]] and the proposed [[Reform Treaty]], set the cap on membership for a single election at 750.<ref name="ENA History"/><ref>{{cite web|title = The history of the European Parliament|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/eplive/expert/shotlist_page/20070314SHL04223/default_fr.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Framework|url=http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?Link=/AboutUs/APCE_framework.htm|publisher = [[Council of Europe]]|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =Overview of the Pan-African Parliament|publisher = [[Pan-African Parliament]]|url=http://www.pan-africanparliament.org/AboutPAP_Overview.aspx|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref>

In 1999, pressure from the Parliament forced the resignation of the [[Santer Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Topan|first=Angelina|title = The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation' |date=[[2002-09-30]]|publisher=European Intergration Online Papers|url=http://eiop.or.at/eiop/pdf/2002-014.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> In 2004, following the largest trans-national election in history, the [[European Council]] for the first time took account of the elections when choosing the [[President of the European Commission]] and Parliament again exerted pressure to force a change in the proposed [[Barroso Commission]]. That connection has been enshrined in the proposed Reform Treaty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tobais|first=Troll|title =<U+201C>We have to democratise procedures<U+201D>|date=[[2004-11-02]]|publisher=Caf<U+00E9> Babel|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=T&Id=2620|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> This change since its foundation was highlighted by Professor David Farrell<!--don't link, not a football player--> of the [[University of Manchester]];<ref name="Farrell Powerful">{{cite web|title = Professor Farrell: "The EP is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world"|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-7838-162-06-24-901-20070615IPR07837-11-06-2007-2007-false/default_en.htm|date=[[2007-06-18]]|accessdate = 2007-07-05}}</ref>
{{cquote|"For much of its life, the European Parliament could have been justly labelled a 'multi-lingual talking shop'. But this is no longer the case: the EP is now one of the most powerful legislatures in the world both in terms of its legislative and executive oversight powers."}}

== Powers and functions ==
[[Image:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The Parliament's hemicycle (debating chamber) in Brussels]]
The Parliament and Council are essentially two chambers in the bicameral legislative branch of the European Union, with legislative power being officially distributed equally between both chambers. However there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament or Council have the power of legislative initiative. In [[European Community|Community matters]], this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Meaning that while Parliament can amend and reject [[legislation]], and make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law.<ref>{{cite web|title = Fact Sheets 1.3.8 The Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/1_3_8_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-14 }}</ref>

The Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through [[European Union law#Institutional acts|non-binding resolutions]] and [[Committees of the European Parliament|committee hearings]], as a "pan-European [[soapbox]]" with the ear of [[Brussels and the European Union#Centre of activity|thousands of Brussels-based journalists]]. There is also an indirect affect on [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]]; the Parliament must approve all development grants, including those overseas. For example, the support for [[Iraq War|post-war Iraq]] reconstruction, or incentives for the secession of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iranian nuclear development]], must be supported by the Parliament. Parliamentary support was also required for the transatlantic passenger data-sharing deal with the United States.<ref name="Rockwell">{{cite book | last = Schnabel | first = Rockwell | coauthors = Francis Rocca | title = The Next Superpower?: the Rise of Europe and its Challenge to the United States | publisher = [[Rowman & Littlefield]] Publishers | date = 2005 | location = Oxford | pages = 111 | isbn = 978-0742545489 }}</ref>

===Legislative procedure===
With each new treaty, the powers of the Parliament have expanded. Its powers have been primarily defined through the [[European Union legislative procedure|Union's legislative procedures]]. The method which has slowly become the dominant procedure (about three-quarters of policy areas) is the [[Codecision procedure]], where powers are essentially equal between Parliament and Council. In this procedure, all draft legislation introduced by the Commission can be amended, and must be approved, by both chambers before becoming law. 

Other procedures include [[Cooperation procedure|Cooperation]], meaning the Council can overrule the Parliament if it is unanimous along with the [[Consultation procedure|Consultation]], which require just consultation of the Parliament, and [[Assent procedure]], where the Parliament has a veto. The Commission and Council, or just Commission, can also act completely independently of the Parliament, but the use of these procedures are very limited. The procedure also depends upon which type of [[European Union law#Institutional acts|institutional act]] is being used.<ref>{{cite web|title = Powers: Legislative power|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=2&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

In addition to codecision, the Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions. In voting on the [[Bolkestein directive]] in 2006, the Parliament voted by a large majority for over 400 amendments that changed the fundamental principle of the law. The [[Financial Times]] described it in the following terms;<ref>{{cite web|title = How the European parliament got serious|date=[[2006-02-23]]|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/56b6d760-a412-11da-83cc-0000779e2340.html|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>
{{cquote|"The European parliament has suddenly come into its own. It marks another shift in power between the three central EU institutions. Last week's vote suggests that the directly elected MEPs, in spite of their multitude of ideological, national and historical allegiances, have started to coalesce as a serious and effective EU institution, just as enlargement has greatly complicated negotiations inside both the Council and Commission."}}

===Budget===
The legislative branch officially holds the Union's budgetary authority, powers gained through the [[Treaties of the European Union#Budgetary treaties|Budgetary Treaties]] of the 1970s. The [[European Union Budget|EU's budget]] is divided into compulsory and non-compulsory spending. Compulsory spending is that resulting from [[Treaties of the European Union|EU treaties]] (including [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]]) and international agreements, the rest is non-compulsory. While the Council has the last word on compulsory spending, the Parliament has the last word on non-compulsory spending.

The institutions draw up budget estimates and the Commission consolidates them into a draft budget. Both the Council and the Parliament can amend the budget with the Parliament adopting or rejecting the budget at its second reading. The signature of the Parliament's President is required before the budget becomes law.<ref>{{cite web|title = Budgetary power|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=5&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = How is the budget decided?|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://ec.europa.eu/budget/budget_glance/how_decided_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

===Control of the executive===
The [[President of the European Commission]] is proposed by the Council (in practice by the [[European Council]]) and that proposal has to be approved by the Parliament (by a simple majority). Essentially giving the Parliament a veto, but not a right to propose, the head of the executive. Following the approval of the Commission President, the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member-states. Each Commissioner comes before a relevant parliamentary committee hearing covering the proposed portfolio. They are then, as a body, approved or rejected by the Parliament.<ref name="Commission Oversight">{{cite web|title = Oversight over the Commission and Council|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=9&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref name="Commission Appointment">{{cite web|title = Background Information: Election of the European Commission|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+PRESS+BI-20041022-1+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|accessdate = 2007-07-01 }}</ref> In practice, the Parliament has never voted against a President or his Commission, but it did seem likely when the Barroso Commission was put forward. The resulting pressure forced the proposal to be withdrawn and changed to be more acceptable to parliament.<ref>{{cite web|last =Bowley|first=Graham|title =Buttiglione affair highlights evolving role of Parliament : Questions arise on democracy at the EU| publisher =[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[2004-10-18]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/18/brussels_ed3_.php|accessdate = 2007-07-01}}</ref> That pressure was seen as an important sign by some of the evolving nature of the Parliament and its ability to make the Commission accountable, rather than being a rubber stamp for candidates. Further more, in voting on the Commission, MEPs also voted along party lines, rather than national lines, despite frequent pressure from national governments on their MEPs. This cohesion and willingness to use the Parliament's power ensured greater attention from national leaders, other institutions and the public<U+2014>who previously gave the lowest ever turnout for the Parliament's elections.<ref>{{cite web|last =Murray|first=Alasdair|title =Three cheers for EU democracy| publisher =[[Centre for European Reform]]|date=2004|url=http://www.cer.org.uk/articles/39_murray.html|accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref>

The Parliament also has the power to [[censure]] the Commission, as a body, once they are in power with a two-thirds majority. As with approval, this power has never been used but it was threatened to the [[Santer Commission]], who subsequently [[Santer Commission#Resignation|resigned of their own accord]]. There are a few other controls, such as: the requirement of Commission to submit reports to the Parliament and answer questions from MEPs; the requirement of the President-in-office of the [[European Council]] to present their programme at the start of their [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]]; the right of MEPs to make proposals for legislation and policy to the Commission and Council; and the right to question members of those institutions (e.g. "Commission Question Time" every Tuesday ).<ref name="Commission Oversight"/><ref name="Commission Appointment"/>

===Supervisory powers===
The Parliament also has other powers of general supervision, mainly granted by the Maastricht Treaty.<ref>{{cite web|title = Maastricht Treaty 15 years on: birth of the "European Union"|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|date=[[2007-02-07]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/008-2784-036-02-06-901-20070206STO02783-2007-05-02-2007/default_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-06}}</ref> The [[European Ombudsman]] is elected by the Parliament, who deals with public complaints against all institutions ([[EU citizens]] can petition the Parliament to act on European issues within the Parliament's sphere). The Parliament has the power to set up a Committee of Inquiry, for example over mad cow disease or CIA detention flights<U+2014>the former led to the creation of the [[European Medicines Agency|European veterinary agency]]. The Parliament can call other institutions to answer questions and if necessary to take them to [[Court of Justice of the European Communities|court]] if they break EU law or treaties. Finally, the Parliament has powers over the appointment of the members of the [[Court of Auditors]] and the President and executive board of the [[European Central Bank]]. The bank's President is also obliged to present an annual report to the parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title = Supervisory power|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?id=46&pageRank=8&language=EN|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.

==Members==
{{main|Member of the European Parliament}}
The European Parliament represents around 496 million citizens of the EU. Its members are known in [[English language|English]] as Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). They are elected every 5 years by [[universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] and sit according to political allegiance. Prior to 1979 they were appointed by their national parliaments. Members' are allocated seats according to population, the total number of MEPs should be 732; however, since 1 January 2007 there are 785 MEPs due to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. The figure is due to drop to 736 after the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 election]]; on average, that is 671,000 citizens per MEP.<ref>{{cite web|title = Composition of the European Parliament|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.ena.lu?lang=2&doc=3999 |accessdate = 2007-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Parliament all set for enlargement|publisher=[[European NAvigator]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/highlights/en/302.html|accessdate = 2007-06-14 }}</ref>

===Political groups===
{{main|European Parliament political group}}
MEPs in the Parliament are currently organised into 8 different political groups with 15 non-attached members, also known as ''[[non-inscrits]]''. These groups are not, by definition, [[European political party|European political parties]], but are usually composed of them. In some cases there is a single party forming its own group, or it may be numerous parties forming a [[coalition]]. Although it should be noted that no parties form coalitions for government at present.<ref>{{cite web|title = Party Politics in the EU|publisher = civitas.org.uk|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/FSCIT/CIT3.html|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref name="Kreppel">{{cite web|last = Kreppel|first=Amie|title = The European Parliament and Supranational Party System|publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=2002|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/06251/sample/9780521806251ws.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> There are three main groups (of more than 100 MEPs). The [[European People's Party-European Democrats]] (EPP-ED) is the largest, with 278 MEPs. It is a centre-right alliance of the [[European People's Party]] (Christian Democrats) and [[European Democrats]]. The leader of the group is [[Joseph Daul]], and it is the only group to include members from every EU state.<ref>{{cite web|title = What is the EPP-ED group?|publisher = [[European People's Party - European Democrats]] |url=http://www.epp-ed.eu/home/en/aboutus.asp|accessdate = 2007-06-13 }}</ref> The [[Party of European Socialists]] (PES) is the second largest group with 201 MEPs. It is a centre-left party led by [[Martin Schulz]].<ref>{{cite web|title = The PES in the European Parliament|publisher = [[Party of European Socialists]]|url=http://www.pes.org/content/view/27/54/lang,en/|accessdate = 2007-06-13 }}</ref> The [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) is the third largest force in Parliament with 103 MEPs. It is a liberal-centrist alliance of the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]] and the [[European Democratic Party]], led by [[Graham Watson]].<ref>{{cite web|title = ALDE MEPs|publisher=[[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] |url=http://www.alde.eu/index.php?id=meps|accessdate = 2007-06-13 }}</ref> There are a further five groups, including the greens, nationalists and fringe groups. Recognised groups have to include 20 members from one-fifth of member states.<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. Rule 29: Formation of political groups|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20070606+RULE-029+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate = 2007-06-15 }}</ref> 

The political parties comprising the parliamentary groups are themselves comprised of national parties. For example, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] forms part of the European Democrats, which, in turn, forms part of the EPP-ED group. Therefore, the make-up of the Parliament's groups are more fluid, with national or European parties easily able to switch between groups, which often occurs after elections or an enlargement; for example, the formation of [[Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty]] (ITS) after the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.<ref>{{cite web|title = European political parties and groups in the European Parliament|publisher=EurActiv.com|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/Fixed/groups/EU-political-parties.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref name="Kreppel"/> Groups such as ITS are primarily formed for the rights and financial subsidies offered to formal groups in the Parliament, however the establishment of ITS caused a minor political storm in the parliament due to the ideology of ITS; the members of the group are far-right so there are concerns about public funds going towards such a group.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brunwasser|first=Matthew|title=Bulgaria and Romania bolster far right profile in EU Parliament|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/14/news/right.php|date=[[2007-01-14]]|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS however that never came to fruition. However they were blocked from gaining leading positions on committees<U+2014>a right that is meant to be afforded to all parties.<ref>{{cite web|title = Far-Right Wing Group Sidelined in European Parliament|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2335201,00.html|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=[[2007-02-02]]|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

Elections have taken place, directly in every member-state, every five years since 1979. Occasionally, when a member joins mid-term, they will hold [[by-elections]], as can be seen with the elections in Romania and Bulgaria (see below). Elections take place across several days according to local custom and, aside from having to be proportional, the [[electoral system]] is chosen by the member-state. This includes allocation of [[European Parliament constituency|sub-national constituencies]]; while most members have a national list, some, like the UK and France, divide their allocation between regions. Seats are allocated to member-states according to their population, with no state having more than 99, but no fewer than 5, in order to maintain proportionality.<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament: electoral procedures|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/facts/1_3_4_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

The most recent Union-wide elections to the European Parliament were the [[European Parliament election, 2004|European elections of 2004]], held in June of that year. They were the largest simultaneous transnational elections ever held anywhere in the world, since nearly 400 million citizens were eligible to vote. The proportion of MEPs elected in 2004 who were female was 30.2%; in 1979 it was just 16.5%. The [[European Parliament election, 2009|next Union-wide elections]] will be in 2009. There are a number of proposals to "dress up" the next elections to attract greater public attention to them. These include most notably the idea of linking them more closely to the Commission presidency. This would be by having political parties running with candidates for the job, so the largest party would essentially be forming the government, as in the [[parliamentary system]] of government. It is hoped such changes would add legitimacy and counter the falling turnout<ref>{{cite web|last=Spongenberg|first=Helena|title=EU wants to dress up 2009 elections on TV|date=[[2007-02-26]]|publisher=EU Observer|url=http://www.euobserver.com/9/23566|accessdate=2007-07-08}}</ref><ref name="Palmer">{{cite web|last = Palmer|first=John|title = Size shouldn't matter|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[2007-01-10]]|url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/john_palmer/2007/01/good_rather_than_bad_not_b_ig.html|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref><ref name="EUO Political">{{cite web|last = Mahony |first=Honor|title = European politics to get more political|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-06-27]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24370|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> which has dropped consistently every year since the first election, and from 1999 it has been below 50%.<ref>{{cite web|title = Bulgaria votes for European Parliament legislators|date=[[2007-05-20]]|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/20/africa/sofia.php|accessdate = 2007-05-20 }}</ref> In 2007 both [[European Parliament election, 2007|Bulgaria and Romania are electing their MEPs]] in by-elections, having joined at the beginning of 2007.

==Proceedings==
Each year the activities of the Parliament cycle between committee weeks where reports are discussed in committees and interparliamentary delegations meet, political group weeks for members to discuss work within their political groups and session weeks where members spend 3<U+00BD> days in [[Strasbourg]] for part-sessions. In addition six 2 day part-sessions are organised in [[Brussels]] throughout the year. Four weeks are allocated as constituency week to allow members to do exclusively constituency work. Finally there are no meetings planned during the summer weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title = European Parliament 2007 calendar of activities|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/general/cal2007.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> The Parliament has the power to meet without being convened by another authority. Its meetings are partly controlled by the treaties but otherwise up to Parliament according to its own "Rules of Procedure" (the regulations governing the parliament).<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.

During sessions, members may speak after being called on by the President, with a time limit of one minute. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates.<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament.

That is when each MEP in turn is called by name, in alphabetical order, to state their support or opposition. This is a historical system used when the Parliament was much smaller in membership and is rarely used now. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example when the President is elected).<ref>{{cite web|title = How do MEPs vote?|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/009-9320-171-06-25-901-20060628STO09319-2006-20-06-2006/default_en.htm|date=[[2006-06-28]]|accessdate = 2007-07-06 }}</ref> All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the [[Official Journal of the European Union]] and can be accessed online.<ref>{{cite web|title = The different types of document available on Europarl|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/guide/search/docsearch_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}</ref>

Members are arranged in a [[hemicycle]] according to their political groups who ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are taken up by the Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences.<ref>{{cite web|title = Brussels seating plan|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/data/fast_access/doc//PLAN_BRX_JUIN_2007.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Strasbourg seating plan|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sce/data/fast_access/doc//PLAN%20STR%20MAI%202007.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers. who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers also act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the [[French Revolution]]. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black [[Tailcoat|tails]] and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited in the same manner as the [[EPSO|European civil service]]. The President is allocated a personal usher.<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament Ushers|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-1533-304-10-44-901-20051017FCS01532-31-10-2005-2005/default_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-21 }}</ref>

===President===
{{main|President of the European Parliament}}
The President, currently [[Hans-Gert P<U+00F6>ttering]] of the EPP, is essentially the [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]] of the Parliament. He or she presides over the plenary when it is in session and the President's signature is required for all acts adopted by co-decision, including the EU budget. The President is also responsible for representing the Parliament externally, including legal matters, and the application of the rules of procedure. He or she is elected for two and a half year terms, meaning two elections per parliamentary term.<ref>{{cite web|title = Duties of the President|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20040720+RULE-019+DOC+XML+V0//EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Functions|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/defaulten_mac.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-15 }}</ref>

[[Image:Hans-Gert Poettering (2007).jpg|thumb|right|190px|President Hans-Gert P<U+00F6>ttering]]
A number of notable figures have been President of the Parliament and its predecessors. The first President was [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], one of the [[Founding father#European Union|founding fathers of the Union]]. Other founding fathers include [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Robert Schuman]]. The two female Presidents were Simone Veil in 1979 (first President of the elected Parliament) and [[Nicole Fontaine]] in 1999, both Frenchwomen.<ref>{{cite web|title = Former E.P. Presidents|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/defaulten.htm?former|accessdate = 2007-06-15 }}</ref>

During the election of a President, the plenary is presided over by the oldest member of the Parliament. In 2004 and 2007 this was [[Giovanni Berlinguer]]. While the oldest member is in the chair, they hold all the powers of the President but the only business that may be addressed is the election of the President.<ref>{{cite web|title = Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. Rule 11: Oldest member|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20070101+RULE-011+DOC+XML+V0//EN&navigationBar=YES|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

===Organisation===
Below the President, there are 14 [[President of the European Parliament#Vice-Presidents|Vice-Presidents]] who chair debates when the President is not in the chamber. There are an number of other bodies and posts responsible for the running of parliament besides these speakers. The two main bodies are the [[Bureau (European Parliament)|Bureau]], which is responsible for budgetary and administration issues, and the [[Conference of Presidents]] which is a governing body composed of the presidents of each of the parliament's political groups. Looking after the financial and administrative interests of members are six [[Quaestor (European Parliament)|Quaestors]]. [[Committees of the European Parliament|Committees and Delegations]] are represented by their chairmen in the form of the [[Committees of the European Parliament#Conference Chairmen|Conference of Committee]] and the [[Committees of the European Parliament#Conference Chairmen|Conference of Delegation Chairmen]]. The [[European Parliament political group|political groups]] also play a major role in the parliament.

[[Committees of the European Parliament|Committees]] are composed of MEPs, with a [[chairman]] and three vice-chairmen leading the numerous committee members. The Committees produce reports for debate, usually compiled by a [[rapporteur]]. When drafting legislation, the Commission would consult the relevant committee who could propose amendments. Temporary committees may be set up to deal with a particular issue. [[Committees of the European Parliament#Delegations|Delegations]] of the Parliament are formed in a similar manner and are responsible for relations with Parliaments outside the Union.<ref>{{cite web|title = How the Parliament is Organised|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=45|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

In addition to Delegations, MEPs also participate in a number of international bodies. For example the [[ACP EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly]], the [[Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly]], the [[Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly]], the [[Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue]] and through [[Election monitoring|election observation]] in third countries.<ref>{{cite web|title =European Parliament: In Detail|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/expert.do?language=EN|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}</ref> Every year since 1988, on the anniversary of the signing of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the Parliament has awarded the [[Sakharov Prize]] to someone (or a number of people) who have dedicated their lives to defend freedoms and human rights.<ref>{{cite web|title =Human Rights Unit|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/comparl/afet/droi/sakharov/default.htm|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

===Translation===
Speakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the [[Languages of the European Union|EU's 23 official languages]], ranging from [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] to [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and [[Irish language|Irish]]. Simultaneous translation is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated. With twenty-three languages, the European Parliament is the most multilingual parliament in the world<ref>{{cite web|title = Press Release: Irish language arrives in European Parliament|date=[[2007-01-11]]|publisher=European Parliament Irish Office|url=http://www.europarl.ie/news_press_release_2_2007.html|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> and the biggest employer of interpreters in the world (employing 350 full time and 400 free-lancers when there is higher demand).<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's Interpreters.|date=[[2006-04-12]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-6936-093-04-14-901-20060403FCS06935-03-04-2006-2006/default_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref> Citizens may also address the Parliament in [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] and [[Galician language|Galician]].<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament allows the written communication of citizens in Basques in Basque, Catalan and Galician.|date=2006|publisher=Ciemen|url=http://www.ciemen.org/mercator/notidetail.cfm?IDA=897&lg=gb|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref>

[[Image:EP Translation booths.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Translation booths in the Brussels hemicycle]]
Usually a language is translated from a foreign tongue into a translators native tongue. Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 translation is sometimes done the opposite way, out of a translators native tongue (the "retour" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be translated via a third language for lack of interpreters ("relay" interpreting)<U+2014>for example, when translating [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's Interpreters: Some facts and figures.|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-6936-093-04-14-901-20060403FCS06935-03-04-2006-2006/default_p001c001_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref> Interpreters need to be proficient in two other Union languages beside their native language. Due to the complexity of the issues, translation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This involves a detailed of understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use colourful language, jokes and word play or speak too fast.<ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's Interpreters: To be or not to be... an interpreter.|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-6936-093-04-14-901-20060403FCS06935-03-04-2006-2006/default_p001c002_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = The European Parliament's Interpreters: More than words.|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/focus_page/008-6936-093-04-14-901-20060403FCS06935-03-04-2006-2006/default_p001c003_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref>

While some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, the translation and the cost of it has been criticised by some. A 2006 report by MEP [[Alexander Stubb]] highlighted that by only using [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] costs could be reduced from 118,000 [[euro]] per day (for 21 languages then<U+2014>[[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] having not yet been included) to 8,900 euro per day.<ref>{{cite web|title = In European Parliament, debate - in 21 languages - can be pricey|date=[[2006-09-12]]|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0912/p05s01-woeu.html|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> Although many see the ideal single language as being English due to its widespread usage, there is a campaign to make French the single tongue for all legal texts, due to its more precise legal language, overcoming ambiguity between translations of legislation. Although this would not directly affect translation in the plenary, it would shift the balance towards French when discussing draft legislation.<ref>{{cite web|title = Campaign to make French sole legal language in EU|date=[[2007-02-07]]|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/07/europe/EU-GEN-EU-French.php|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

===Seat===
{{main|Location of European Union institutions}}
[[Image:Institutions europeennes IMG 4292.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The cost of two seats has been a cause of controversy (the Strasbourg building)]]
The Parliament is based in three different cities with [[Buildings of the European Parliament|numerous buildings]]. A protocol attached to the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in [[Strasbourg]] (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in [[Brussels]]. [[Luxembourg]] hosts the [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]].<ref name="Consolidated Treaty"/>

The Strasbourg seat is seen by some as  a symbol of reconciliation between France and Germany (Strasbourg being fought over by both countries in the past). However it is questioned over the cost of having two seats for the parliament. While Strasbourg is the official seat, and sits alongside the [[Council of Europe]] (with which the "mutual cooperation" is being continuously "fostered"<ref>{{cite web|title = The Council of Europe and the European Union sign an agreement to foster mutual cooperation|date=[[2007-05-23]]|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR331(2007)&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=F5CA75&BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&BackColorLogged=A9BACE&ShowBanner=no&Target=_self|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>), [[Brussels and the European Union|Brussels is home to nearly all other major EU institutions]], with the majority of Parliaments work already being carried out there. Therefore despite Strasbourg being the main seat, it is the one most questioned, although some do believe Strasbourg should be the single capital.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheatly|first=Paul|title = The two-seat parliament farce must end|date=[[2006-10-02]]|url=http://www.cafebabel.com/en/article.asp?T=A&Id=2047|publisher=Caf<U+00E9> Babel|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref>

Critics have described the two-seat arrangement as a "travelling circus"<ref name="Seat Green">{{cite web|first=|title=Greens condemn EU parliament's 'traveling circus'|date=[[2007-04-26]]|url=http://www.4ecotips.com/eco/article_show.php?aid=1222&id=280|publisher=4ecotips|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> and there is a strong movement to establish Brussels as the sole seat. This is due to the fact that the other political institutions (the Commission, Council and European Council) are located there and hence is treated as the '[[capital]]' of the EU. This movement has received strong backing through numerous figures, including the Commission First-Vice President who stated that "something that was once a very positive symbol of the EU reuniting France and Germany has now become a negative symbol<U+2014>of wasting money, bureaucracy and the insanity of the Brussels institutions".<ref name="Wallstr<U+00F6>m Blog"/> The [[European Green Party|Green party]] has also noted the environmental cost in a study led by [[Jean Lambert]] MEP and [[Caroline Lucas]] MEP; in addition to the extra 200 million euro spent on the extra seat, there are over 20,268 tonnes of additional carbon dioxide, undermining any environmental stance of the institution and the Union.<ref name="Seat Green"/> The campaign is further backed by a million-strong online petition started by MEP [[Cecilia Malmstr<U+00F6>m]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Malmstr<U+00F6>m | first = Cecilia|authorlink=Cecilia Malmstr<U+00F6>m|title = OneSeat.eu|url=http://www.oneseat.eu/|accessdate = 2007-06-12 }}</ref> In 2006 there were allegations of irregularity in the charges made by the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament rented which harmed the city's image further.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kroeger|first=Alix|title=EU and Strasbourg in rent row|date=[[2006-04-27]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4952228.stm|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> A poll of MEPs also found 89% of the respondents (39%) wanting a single seat, and 81% preferring Brussels.<ref>{{cite web|title = Euro MPs want to scrap Strasbourg base: poll|date=[[2007-06-13]]|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news_live/1181757615.41|publisher=EU Business|accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> Another, more academic, survey found 68% support.<ref name="Farrell Powerful"/> This has not affected the position of France, which can veto any such move, with [[French President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] stating that it seat is "non-negotiable".<ref>{{cite web|last=Banks|first=Martin|title=Sarkozy slated over Strasbourg seat|date=[[2007-05-24]]|publisher=EU Politix: The Parliament|url=http://www.eupolitix.com/EN/News/200705/8216d9d5-0c44-46e2-a6d8-6166c30e812f.htm|accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>

The proposed [[Reform Treaty]], the details of which were agreed in June 2007, largely retains the reforms outlined in the rejected [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|Constitutional Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|last =[[European Council]]|title = Brussels European Council 21/22 June 2007: Presidency Conclusions |date=[[2007-06-22]]|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|Council of the European Union]]|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/ec/94932.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-06-22 }}</ref> Overall, powers would be increased. For example nearly all policy areas would fall under co-decision procedure (now called the "ordinary legislative procedure") meaning that the Parliament would have practically equal powers to those of the Council (now officially the Council of Ministers). In the remaining minority of areas in which the powers remain unequal, the Council must consult the Parliament and/or seek its approval on the legislation. The Parliament also gains greater powers over the entire of the EU budget, not just non-compulsory expenditure, through the ordinary legislative procedure. In terms of the composition of the Parliament, there would be little change, however the minimum number of seats would be increased from 5 to 6 and the maximum number would be reduced from 99 to 96. There would also be basic rules on the distribution of seats in the Parliament, rather than them being negotiated at each enlargement. Decisions about the composition of the Parliament are currently made by the Council, this would remain so but the decision would be made based on a proposal from the Parliament itself.<ref name="Constitution info">{{cite web|title = The Union's institutions: The European Parliament|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/parliament_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref>

The European Council would be bound to take into account the latest elections when proposing the Commission President, something that they willingly did after the 2004 election. As currently, the Parliament's consent is needed for the President to take office, however the Reform Treaty now uses the word "elect" rather than "approve" to refer to this procedure. This is an area however in which the Council of Ministers plays no part.<ref name="Constitution info"/> It will remain to be seen whether calling it an election will spur political groups to use their power and mandate to force their own candidates upon the European Council in the same way as, for example, the [[British House of Commons]] does in its relation to [[British monarchy|their Queen]]. There have been suggestions that the parliament's political groups may propose their own candidates before the 2009 election, aiding this there are plans to strengthen European political parties.<ref name="Palmer"/><ref name="EUO Political"/>

In addition to the institutional reforms brought by the Reform Treaty, in 2007 the President set up a ''special working group on parliamentary reform'' to improve the efficiently and image of the Parliament. Some ideas include livening up the plenary sessions and a [[State of the Union]] debate. It is due to produce a final report in 2008, and put the recommendations into practice by the 2009 elections.<ref>{{cite web|title = Improving the public perception and efficiency of the work of the European Parliament - mandate for a working group on reform of the Parliament|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|date=[[2007-02-15]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-3202-050-02-08-901-20070215IPR03201-19-02-2007-2007-false/default_en.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> One of the groups key reform ideas, extra debates on topical issues, was rejected by MEPs in July 2007 over fears it would disrupt committee work while attracting very few attendees.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kubosova|first=Lucia|title=MEPs turn down modernising reform|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-07-12]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24472|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> On the back of that rejection however, MEPs have backed a proposal to use the [[European symbols]] more often in the Parliament. This comes after the European Council's agreement for the Reform Treaty dropped the provisions of the Constitution which would have given the symbols official status. [[Jo Leinen]] MEP suggested that the Parliament take the ''[[avant-garde]]'' in using the flag and anthem, the latter being rarely used in Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|title=MEPs defy member states on EU symbols|publisher=EU Observer|date=[[2007-07-11]]|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24464|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> <U+2014> the Parliament first adopted the [[European flag]] in 1983, three years before it was formally adopted by the Communities as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=The European Flag|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|date=|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Com/About_Coe/flag.asp|accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref>
