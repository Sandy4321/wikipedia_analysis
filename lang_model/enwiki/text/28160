"'''Sunday Bloody Sunday'''" is the opening track and third single from [[U2]]'s 1983 album, ''[[War (album)|War]]''.  The song is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, simple but harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies.<ref name=LA-Times>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Hillburn|date=[[2004-08-08]]|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=3472|title=The Songwriters - U2 - 'Where Craft Ends and Spirit Begins'|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref> One of U2's most overtly-political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of [[The Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]].

[[Bono]] frequently reasserted the song's message to his audience for many years.  Owing to the continued presence of The Troubles in Ireland more than twenty years after the song's debut, Bono has used the song to push his agenda<U+2014>often conveying long, politically-driven diatribes while the song is performed.

Today, it is considered one of U2's [[signature song]]s.

== Background, writing, and recording ==

"Sunday Bloody Sunday" grew from a guitar riff and lyric written by [[The Edge]] in 1982.  While newlyweds [[Bono]] and [[Ali Hewson]] honeymooned in [[Jamaica]], The Edge worked in Ireland on music for the band's upcoming album.  Following an argument with his girlfriend, and a period of doubt in his own song-writing abilities, The Edge<U+2014>"feeling depressed"<U+2014>"channeled [his] fear and frustration and self-loathing into a piece of music."<ref name=U2-by-U2>{{cite book|last=U2|authorlink=U2|coauthors=McCormick, N.|title=U2 by U2|date=[[2006-09-26]]|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|location=New York|id=ISBN 0-06-077675-7|pages=135<U+2013>139}}</ref> This early draft did not yet have a title or chorus melody, but did contain a structural outline and theme. After Bono had reworked the lyrics, the band recorded the song at [[Windmill Lane Studios]] in Dublin.  During the sessions, producer [[Steve Lilywhite]] encouraged drummer [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] to utilize a [[click track]], but Mullen was firmly against the idea.  A chance meeting with [[Andy Newmark]] (of [[Sly & the Family Stone]])<U+2014>a drummer who used a click track religiously<U+2014>changed Mullen's mind.<ref name=U2-by-U2 />  The opening drum pattern soon developed into the song's hook. A local [[violinist]], [[Steve Wickham]], approached The Edge one morning at a [[bus stop]] and asked if U2 had any need for a violin on their next album.  In the studio for only half a day, Wickham's electric violin became the final instrumental contribution to the song.<ref name=U2-by-U2 />

== Musical structure and lyrics ==
[[Image:Sunday Bloody Sunday riff A.png|left|thumb|350 px|This two-[[Bar (music)|bar]] guitar [[riff]]<ref name=SM>Commercial sheet music for "Sunday Bloody Sunday." ''Universal-Polygram International Music Publishing''. Distributed by Hal Leonard Publishing.  ISBN 0-7119-7309-1.  Retrieved [[December 12]] [[2006]].</ref> is repeated often throughout "Sunday Bloody Sunday."]]
The studio version of the song opens with a martial drumbeat and [[electric violin]] part, both at a medium tempo, in a 4/4 [[time signature|time]].<ref name=SM/>  The aggressive [[snare drum]] rhythm closely resembles a beat used to keep a [[military band]] in step. The distinctive drum sound was achieved by recording Mullen's drumwork at the base of a staircase, producing a more natural reverb.  It is followed by [[The Edge]]'s  repetitive [[arpeggio]]s (see notation at right), which establish the [[minor chord]] territory of the piece.  As the song progresses, the lyrics and guitar become more furious.  The guitar riff has been described as  the "bone-crushing arena-rock riff of the decade" by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name=RS>{{cite news|last=Connelly|first=Christopher|date=[[1984-01-19]]|url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/102415/under_a_blood_red_sky|title=Rolling Stone: Under A Blood Red Sky Review|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>  A [[bass drum]] kick on every beat provides the musical foundation until the first chorus, when [[Adam Clayton]]'s [[bass guitar]] enters.

In contrast to the violent nature of the verses, the emergence of [[major chord]]s creates a feeling of hope during Bono's "How long, how long must we sing this song?" refrain. During the chorus, The Edge's backing vocals  further develop this tread, using a harmonic imitative echo. The snare drum is absent from this section, and the guitar parts are muted. This part of the song deviates musically from the raw aggression seen in the song's verses and gives the song a more uplifting structure.<ref name=SM/>  Bono once commented that "love is<U+2026>a central theme" of "Sunday Bloody Sunday"<ref name=Bono>{{cite news|first=Tristam|last=Lozaw|date=1984-06-01|url=http://atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=1878|title=Love, Devotion & Surrender|publisher=U2 Magazine|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>

The band have said the lyrics refer to the events of both [[Bloody Sunday (1972)]] and [[Bloody Sunday (1920)]], but are not specifically about either event.<ref name=Rona-Elliott>{{cite video|people=U2, Rona Elliot (interviewer)|title=[http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewVideo?id=155853858&p=156472332&s=143441 U2: The Rona Elliot Interview]|medium = Online download|publisher = NBC via iTunes Store|date=1987-09-11|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref>  The song takes the standpoint of someone horrified by the cycle of violence in the province. Bono rewrote The Edges's initial lyrics, attempting to contrast the two events with [[Easter Sunday]], but he has said that the band was too inexperienced at the time to fully realise that goal, noting that "it was a song whose eloquence lay in its harmonic power rather than its verbal strength."<ref name=U2-by-U2/>

Early versions opened with the line ''Don't talk to me about the rights of the IRA, UDA''.<ref name=U2-by-U2 />  U2's bassist, [[Adam Clayton]], recalls that better judgment led to the removal of such a politically-charged line, and that the song's "viewpoint became very humane and non-sectarian<U+2026>which, is the only responsible position."<ref name=IntoTheHeart>{{cite book|first=Niall|last=Stokes|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Into The Heart: The Story Behind Every U2 Song|date=1996|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|location=Australia|id=ISBN 0-7322-6036-1|pages=37<U+2013>39}}</ref> The chosen opening line ''"I can't believe the news today"'' crystalises the prevailing response, especially among young people, to the violence in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=IntoTheHeart /> In successive stanzas, however, the lyrics appear to disown that anger and place the song in a religious context<U+2014>paraphrasing text from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Matthew#10:35|10:35]] ("mother's children; brothers, sisters torn apart") and bringing a twist to [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#15:32|15:32]] ("we eat and drink while tomorrow they die").  The song finishes with a call for the Irish to stop fighting each other, and "claim the victory Jesus won<U+2026>on [a] Sunday bloody Sunday."<ref name=SM/>

== Reactions ==
U2 were aware when they decided to record "Sunday Bloody Sunday" that its lyrics could be misinterpreted as [[sectarian]], and possibly jeopardize their personal lives.  Some of The Edge's original lyrics explicitly spoke out against violent rebels, but were omitted in order to protect the group.<ref name=U2-by-U2/> Even without these lyrics, some listeners still considered it to be a [[Irish rebel music|rebel song]]<U+2014>even one which glorifies the events of the two Bloody Sundays to which the lyrics refer.<ref name=BF>{{cite book|last=Flanagan|first=Bill|title=U2 at the End of the World|pages=385|publisher=Dell Publishing|location=New York|id=ISBN 0-385-31154-0|date=[[1996-09-01]]}}</ref>

Commercially, the single had its biggest impact in [[The Netherlands]], where it reached number 3 on the national charts.<ref name=Dutch />  In the U.S., the song gained significant [[album oriented rock]] radio airplay, and together with the earlier "[[New Year's Day (song)|New Year's Day]]" helped exposed U2 to a mainstream American rock audience.

Critical reaction to the song was mostly positive.  In the Irish magazine ''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]'', Liam Mackey wrote that "Sunday Bloody Sunday" "takes the widescreen view<U+2026>a powerful riff and machine-gun drumming [is] crisscrossed by skipping violin."<ref name=HP />  Denise Sullivan commented for ''[[All Music Guide]]'' that Mullen's opening drumwork "helps set the tone for the unforgiving, take-no-prisoners feel of the song, as well as for the rest of the album."<ref name=AMG />  In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked "Sunday Bloody Sunday" 268th on its list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref name=RS2>{{cite web|last=Editors|first=''Rolling Stone''|title=Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time <U+2014> #268|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6596113/sunday_bloody_sunday|accessdate = 2006-10-22}}</ref>

== Live performances ==

"Sunday Bloody Sunday" has been performed more than 600 times by U2.<ref name=live />  It was first heard by a live audience in December 1982, on a twenty-one show "Pre-[[War Tour]]." The band were particularly nervous about playing the song in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]].  Upon introducing the song there, Bono promised to "never play it again" if the crowd didn't like it.  The crowd overwhelmingly enjoyed the song; The Edge recalls that "the place went nuts, it drew a really positive reaction."<ref>{{cite book  | last = U2 Limited  | title = U2 by U2  | publisher = HarperCollins''Publishers''  | date = 2006  | location = London  | pages = 179| id =  ISBN 0-00-719668-7}}</ref>  The band remained apprehensive, however.  Even by the song's sixth performance, Bono was introducing the song with the statement "This is ''not'' a rebel song."<ref name=Pimm>{{cite book|title=U2 Live: A Concert Documentary|last=de la Parra|first=Pimm Jal|publisher=Omnibus Press|id=ISBN 0-7119-9198-7|date=March 1995}}</ref>

[[Image:U2 Sunday Bloody Sunday Red Rocks.jpg|right|200px|thumb|This performance in June 1983 was later released as the song's music video.]]

Throughout 1983's War Tour, Bono continued to reassure audiences that "This song is not a rebel song, this song is 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'" <ref name=RR>U2.  ''Under a Blood Red Sky''.  Island Records.  Compact disc, 1983.</ref> highlighting the non-partisan intentions of the lyrics. The live performances on this tour featured a routine during which Bono would set a [[white flag]] in the front of the stage while the band [[vamp (music)|vamp]]ed three chords<U+2014>A minor, C major, and F major.  As the band vamped, Bono would sing "no more!" with the audience.<ref name=RRV>{{cite video|people = U2, Gavin Taylor (director)|title=[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275013/ Under a Blood Red Sky]|medium = VHS|publisher= RCA / Columbia Video|date = 1983}}</ref>   These performances were highly effective with U2's audience (at the time, U2 was most popular as a [[college rock]] act).  In the [[Unforgettable Fire Tour]] of 1984 and 1985, "Sunday Bloody Sunday" continued to be a prominent midpoint of each U2 concert<U+2014>as did the "no more!" interlude.  Along with an epic performance of "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]," the song was performed at [[Live Aid]] in July 1985.

As U2 reached new levels of fame in 1987 with ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', "Sunday Bloody Sunday" continued to be a focal point of concerts.  Some performances featured slower, more contemplative versions of the song; other concerts saw the wilder, more violent version.  This tour marked the first time "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was played in [[Northern Ireland]] since 1982, and it has not been performed there since.<ref name=live /> 

The 1988 [[rockumentary]] ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' includes a particularly renowned version of the song, recorded on [[November 8|8th November]], [[1987]] at the [[McNichols Arena]] in [[Denver, Colorado]] <ref>{{cite book |last= Chatterton|first= Mark|title= U2 The Complete Encyclopedia|year= 2001|publisher= Firefly Publishing|location= London}}</ref>.  On this version Bono's mid-song rant angrily and emphatically condemns the [[Remembrance Day Bombing]] that had occurred earlier that same day in the Northern Irish town of [[Enniskillen]]:

<blockquote>And let me tell you somethin'.  I've had enough of Irish Americans who haven't been back to their country in twenty or thirty years come up to me and talk about the ''resistance'', the revolution back home<U+2026>and the ''glory'' of the revolution<U+2026>and the glory of ''dying'' for the revolution.  Fuck the revolution!  They don't talk about the glory of killing for the revolution.  What's the glory in taking a man from his bed and gunning him down in front of his wife and his children?  Where's the glory in that?  Where's the glory in bombing a Remembrance Day parade of old age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day.  Where's the glory in that?  To leave them dying or crippled for life or dead under the rubble of the revolution, that the majority of the people in my country don't want.  No more!<ref name="RH">{{cite video|people = U2, Phil Joanou (director)|title = [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096328/ U2: Rattle and Hum]|medium = DVD|publisher = Paramount|date = 1999}}</ref></blockquote>

After the Joshua Tree Tour, Bono was heard saying the band might never play the song again, because the song was "made real" with the performance in Denver, and it could never be matched again.<ref name=HP2>{{cite news|first=Liam|last=Mackey|date=1998-12-01|url=http://atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=2436|title=I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - Part 1|publisher=Hot Press|accessdate=2006-10-22}}</ref><ref name="RH"/> Following their original intent, "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was not played during any of the forty-seven shows on the [[Lovetown Tour]] in 1989.  The song reappeared for a brief period during the [[Zoo TV Tour]], and late during the second half of [[Popmart Tour]] (1997<U+2013>1998), U2 played an emotional concert in war-ravaged [[Sarajevo]] that included a solo performance of the song by [[The Edge]]. "Sunday Bloody Sunday" was subsequently played live in this style until the end of the tour in March 1998.<ref name=live />

[[Image:U2 MexicoCity1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|This concert in [[Mexico City]] in February 2006 depicts the elaborate stage effects used for "Sunday Bloody Sunday."]]
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" was played at every concert on the 2001 [[Elevation Tour|Elevation]] and 2005<U+2013>2006 [[Vertigo Tour|Vertigo]] tours.<ref name=live />  Performances in 2001 frequently included parts of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[Get Up, Stand Up]]" and "Johnny Was."  A memorable mid-song message referencing the [[Omagh bombing]] of 1998 ("Turn this song into a prayer!") is captured on the live DVD ''[[U2 Go Home: Live From Slane Castle]]''.  In concerts in [[New York City]] after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], the "no more!" interlude was replaced by Bono holding an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]].<ref name=NYC>{{cite news|first=Isaac|last=Guzman|date=[[2001-10-26]]|title=No Bombast, but U2 Bands Together with N.Y.|publisher=New York Daily News}}</ref>

"Sunday Bloody Sunday" was used during the The Vertigo Tour of 2005 and 2006, as one of many politically-driven songs performed during the middle part of the band's set. Bono extended the "no more!" interlude to explain a headband he had donned in the previous song.<ref name="Vertigo">{{cite video|people = U2, Hamish Hamilton (director) |title = [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488664/ Vertigo 2005: U2 Live from Chicago]|medium = DVD|publisher = Island / Interscope Video|date = 2005}}</ref> The headband depicted the word "coexist" (written to depict a [[crescent]], a [[Star of David]], and a [[Christian cross]]). The Coexist symbol is trademarked in the United States by an [[Limited liability partnership|LLP]] in [[Indiana]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coexistonline.com/|title=COEXIST|accessdate=2006-12-16|last=Coexist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=3995|title=Can't We All Just Coexist?|last=Hutchinson|first=Kevin|accessdate=2006-12-16}}</ref>  and the original artwork was created in 2001 by a Polish artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zafryki.art.pl/coex/coex.html|title={{pl icon}} Jerozolimie|accessdate=2006-12-16}}</ref>  As with the 2001 shows, the Vertigo tour saw the song applied to subjects further afield than The Troubles in Northern Island. During 2006 Australian shows, in Brisbane, Bono asked for Australian Terrorism suspect David Hicks to be brought home and tried under Australian laws.  In subsequent Australian concerts he dedicated the song to the victims of the [[2002 Bali bombing|2002 Bali Bombings]]<U+2014>88 of the fatalities were Australians<U+2014>lamenting 'This is your song now!'.

== Music video ==
Although a promotional [[music video]] had not been produced for the original release, the band used footage from a [[June 5]], [[1983]] live performance to promote the song. ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'', directed by Gavin Taylor, displays Bono's use of a [[white flag]] during performances of the song. The video  highlights the intensity and emotion felt by many audience members during U2's concerts, while the rainy, torch-lit setting in [[Colorado]]'s [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] further adds to the atmosphere.  In 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' cited the performance as one of fifty moments that changed the history of rock and roll, and noted that "[t]he sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created by a combination of wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit and<U+2014>shown in heavy rotation on MTV<U+2014>broke the band nationwide."<ref name=RS3>{{cite news|last=Cave|first=Damien, et. al|date=[[2004-06-24]]|title=U2's Gamble at Red Rocks|publisher=Rolling Stone|page=146}}</ref>

=== Cover versions ===
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" has been [[cover version|covered]] by over a dozen different artists, spanning several  musical styles.<ref name=U2W/>  The song is frequently among the tracks recorded for U2 [[tribute album|tribute albums]].
