The '''Shanghai<U+2013>Chengdu Expressway''' ({{zh|s=<U+4E0A><U+6D77><U+FF0D><U+6210><U+90FD><U+9AD8><U+901F><U+516C><U+8DEF>}}), commonly referred to as the ''Hurong Expressway'' ({{zh|s=<U+6CAA><U+84C9><U+9AD8><U+901F><U+516C><U+8DEF>}}) is an east-west bound expressway that connects the eastern metropolis of [[Shanghai]] to [[Chengdu]], the capital city of [[Sichuan]]. The expressway passes through six provinces and serves major cities such as [[Suzhou]], [[Wuxi]], [[Changzhou]], [[Nanjing]], [[Hefei]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Yichang]]. The eastern terminus of G42 is at the [[Wuning Road Interchange]] of [[Shanghai]] [[Middle Ring Road (Shanghai)|Middle Ring Road]]. At its western terminus, the expressway intersects the [[East 3rd Ring Road]] and connects [[East Erxianqiao Road]] in [[Chenghua District]], [[Chengdu]]. When complete, the expressway will span {{convert|1960|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. The only uncompleted section of the expressway is between [[Yichang]], [[Hubei]] and [[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan County]], [[Chongqing]]. This portion of G42, approximately {{Convert|173|km|mi|abbr = on}} in length, is expected to complete and open to traffic in late 2013.<ref>http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2009-07/09/content_11682375.htm</ref><ref>http://www.cq.xinhuanet.com/2013-05/21/c_115844332.htm</ref>

==Route Description==

===Shanghai===

In [[Shanghai Municipality]], the G42 is an eight-lane expressway which concurs with [[G2 Beijing<U+2013>Shanghai Expressway|G2 Beijing-Shanghai Expressway]] for its entire length, and has a speed limit of {{Convert|120|km/h|mi/h|abbr = on}}. The expressway begins at Wuning Road Interchange in Shanghai Middle Ring Road, traveling eastbound. Soon after the intersection with the [[S20 Outer Ring Expressway|S20 Shanghai Outer Ring Expressway]] in [[Jiading District]], the expressway becomes a [[tollway]] at [[Jiangqiao, Shanghai|Jiangqiao]] toll plaza. In [[Qingpu District, Shanghai|Qingpu District]], it intersects with [[G15 Shenyang<U+2013>Haikou Expressway|G15 Shenyang-Haikou Expressway]] via a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]]. At [[Anting|Anting Town]], the G42 connects with [[G1501 Shanghai Ring Expressway]] through a brief connector and two [[trumpet interchanges]], then intersects with the G1501 via an [[overpass]] and enters [[Kunshan, Jiangsu]].

===Jiangsu===

[[Image:Third Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge-2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The expressway crosses the [[Yangtze River]] over the [[Third Nanjing Yangtze Bridge]]]]
The G42 is an eight-lane expressway throughout the province of Jiangsu and has a maximum speed limit of {{Convert|120|km/h|mph|abbr = on}}. It is run concurrently with [[G2 Beijing-Shanghai Expressway]] until [[Huishan District]], [[Wuxi]], where it splits with the northeast-bound G2 and continues east. The expressway bypasses downtown [[Kunshan]] and meets [[Suzhou Ring Expressway]] (concurs with [[Jiangsu S5 Changzhou-Jiaxing Expressway]]). The expressway then travels northwest to downtown [[Suzhou]] and intersects with [[G15W Changshu-Taizhou Expressway]] at [[Wuzhong District, Suzhou]]. From there the expressway turns slightly north and again encounters the [[Suzhou Ring Expressway]] ([[Jiangsu S9 Suzhou-Shaoxing Expressway]]) before entering [[Wuxi]]. In Wuxi, the expressway intersects with [[Jiangsu S19 Taihu Lake Ring Expressway]] before bypassing downtown, and splits with G2 at [[Tongjiang Avenue Interchange|Tongjiang Avenue]], continuing northwest. The G42 then connects with [[Jiangsu S48 Wuxi-Yixing Expressway]] northwest of downtown Wuxi, and meets [[Changshu-Hefei Expressway|Jiangsu S38/Anhui S24 Changshu-Hefei Expressway]]<nowiki/>in [[Wujin District]], [[Changzhou]]. Running north to the downtown Changzhou, G42 meets [[Jiangsu S39 Jiangdu-Yixing Expressway]] in [[Xinbei District]], Changzhou. From there, G42 travels west, bypassing [[Danyang, Jiangsu|Danyang]] and connecting to [[Zhenjiang]] via [[Jiangsu S86 Zhenjiang Auxiliary]]. After meeting [[G4011 Yangzhou-Liyang Expressway]] in [[Dantu District|Dantu District, Zhenjiang]], G42 continues westbound and enters [[Nanjing]].

In [[Nanjing]], G42 first intersects with the southeast portion of [[G2501 Nanjing Ring Expressway]], then follows a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]] near [[Purple Mountain]], [[Qixia District]] to interchange with northbound [[G36 Nanjing-Luoyang Expressway]]. For its entire length south to [[Yangtze River]] in Nanjing, G42 concurs with [[Jiangsu S001 Highway]] and intersects with [[G25 Changchun<U+2013>Shenzhen Expressway|G25 Changchun-Shenzhen Expressway]] near [[Baixia District]]. At [[Huashenmiao Interchange]], the expressway interchanges with [[Jiangsu S55 Nanjing-Xuancheng Expressway]]/[[S88 Airport Expressway]]. Before crossing the Yangtze River, G42 connects to the north-south spur of [[G4211 Nanjing-Wuhu Expressway]] and concurs with G2501 again. Through traffic is then carried across the Yangtze River by [[Third Nanjing Yangtze Bridge]], and the G42 splits with G2501 at an interchange to the east of [[Laoshan National Forest Park]], where G42 turns west and concurs with [[G40 Shanghai-Xi'an Expressway]] for their remaining lengths in Jiangsu. At the town of [[Zhouzhuang (disambiguation)|Zhouzhuang]]{{dn|date=August 2013}}, [[Pukou District]], the expressway becomes a four-lane expressway and enters [[Anhui Province]] at [[Quanjiao County]].

===Anhui===

In Anhui Province, the G42 concurs with [[G40 Shanghai<U+2013>Xi'an Expressway|G40]] until [[Huoqiu County|Huoqiu County, Lu'an]], and is mostly a 4-lane limited-access expressway except for a {{Convert|42.64|km|mi|abbr = on}} section between [[Feidong County]] and [[Hefei]], which has been expanded to an eight-lane expressway in 2009.<ref><U+5408><U+5B81><U+9AD8><U+901F><U+516C><U+8DEF> http://www.baike.com/wiki/<U+5408><U+5B81><U+9AD8><U+901F><U+516C><U+8DEF></ref> The expressway has a maximum speed limit of {{Convert|110|km/h|mi/h|abbr = on}} east of Hefei, and {{Convert|120|km/h|mi/h|abbr = on}} to the west, except for the section between [[Jinzhai County]] and Anhui-Hubei border, where a {{Convert|100|km/h|mph = mph|abbr = on}} speed limit ({{Convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr = on}} in tunnels) is enforced due to mountainous terrains.<ref><U+516D><U+6B66><U+9AD8><U+901F> http://www.anhigh.com/archiver/?tid-2654.html</ref> It concurs with [[G40 Shanghai<U+2013>Xi'an Expressway|G40]] southwest bound. At a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]] east of [[Feidong County|Feidong County, Hefei]], G42 turns north and concurs with [[G3 Beijing-Taipei Expressway]] and [[G4001 Hefei Ring Expressway]] briefly before splitting with G3 and heads west again. Here, G42 continues to concur with G4011 until [[Changfeng County|Changfeng County, Hefei]], where it continues westbound for [[Lu'an]]. The expressway then intersects with G35 in [[Yu'an District|Yu'an District, Lu'an]] and splits with G40 at [[Huoqiu County|Huoqiu County, Lu'an]]. From there, G42 heads southwest into the [[Dabie Mountains]]. This portion of expressway generally follows the [[Anhui S210 Highway]] corridor, but it bypasses the [[Meishan Reservoir]] to the south, and is characterized by expansive bridges and lengthy tunnels. At the village of [[Changlingguan|Changlingguan Pass]], the expressway crosses Anhui-Hubei border and enters [[Macheng, Hubei|Macheng]], [[Hubei Province]].

===Hubei===

[[Image:G42 in Hubei.svg|thumb|left|300px|The expressway in [[Hubei]]]]
The expressway is under construction in [[Hubei Province]] west of [[Yiling District| Yiling District, Yichang]]. The completed portion of G42 is a 4-lane limited access [[tollway]], with a speed limit of 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) for its entire length, except for tunnels, in which a 80&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph) speed limit is enforced. The expressway enters Hubei at the town of [[Muzidian]] and continues westbound to the [[Dabie Mountains Tunnel]]. With a length of {{convert|4900|m|ft|abbr = on}}, the Dabie Mountains Tunnel is the longest tunnel on G42 east of [[Wuhan]].<ref><U+5927><U+522B><U+5C71><U+96A7><U+9053> http://www.baike.com/wiki/<U+5927><U+522B><U+5C71><U+96A7><U+9053></ref> The G42 then heads southwest, bypassing [[Macheng, Hubei|Macheng]] and intersects with [[G45 Daqing-Guangzhou Expressway]] to the west of downtown Macheng. Continuing southwest, the expressway concurs with [[Hubei S3 Wuhan-Macheng Expressway]] and turns west on [[G4201 Wuhan Ring Expressway]] in [[Xinzhou District, Wuhan]], where it concurs briefly with [[G70 Fuzhou-Yinchuan Expressway]]. Through traffic is then carried across the Yangtze River again via the [[Wuhan Yangluo Yangtze River Bridge|Yangluo Yangtze River Bridge]]. At the intersection with [[Hubei S2 Wuhan-Xiaogan Expressway]], G42 splits with G70, which concurs with S2 northwest bound, and continues southwest. It then meets [[Hubei S18 Airport Expressway]] in [[Huangpi District, Wuhan]] and [[G4 Beijing-Hong Kong-Macau Expressway]] in [[Dongxihu District|Dongxihu District, Wuhan]]. At the intersection with G4, G42 splits with G4201 and continues westbound. It intersects with [[Hubei S49 Suizhou-Yueyang Expressway]] in [[Tianmen]] and [[G55 Erenhot<U+2013>Guangzhou Expressway|G55 Erenhot-Guangzhou Expressway]] to the southwest of downtown [[Jingmen]].

The G42 heads slightly south to reach the hydropower city of [[Yichang]] in [[Yiling District]], where it currently terminates at the intersection with [[G50 Shanghai-Chongqing Expressway]], [[Hubei S48 Wuhan-Yichang Expressway]] (which becomes [[Hubei S58 Three Gorges Expressway]] northwest of downtown Yichang), and [[Hubei S63 Laohekou-Shishou Expressway]]. The section through to [[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan]] in Chongqing is under construction.

===Chongqing===

[[Image:Daninghe River Bridge1050553.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The expressway crosses the spectacular [[Daning River Bridge]] in Chongqing]]
The G42 is unfinished in Chongqing. The temporary eastern terminus is at the [[Wushan Interchange]] in [[Wushan County, Chongqing|Wushan County]]. From there the G42 is continuous throughout [[Chongqing]]. Due to restraints of the difficult terrains, the maximum speed on the expressway has been set at 80&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph). The expressway runs parallel to the Yangtze River behind the mountains of [[Three Gorges]]. At [[Gujiaba Interchange]], G42 intersects with the non designated [[Wanzhou-Kai County Expressway]]. It then heads south and bypasses [[Wanzhou District]]. At Qinggangba Interchange, the G42 turns westbound and intersects with the [[Chongqing-Yibin Expressway]], which spurs into the downtown of [[Wanzhou District|Wanzhou]] and becomes the [[G318|G318 National Highway]]. G42 travels southwest until encountering [[G50 Shanghai<U+2013>Chongqing Expressway|G50]] again in [[Taiping Interchange]], [[Dianjiang County]]. The expressway would then travel westbound and enters [[Mingyue Mountain Tunnel]], through which it crosses the Chongqing-Sichuan border and enters [[Sichuan Province]].

===Sichuan===

In Sichuan Province, the G42 is a four-lane expressway with a speed limit of 80&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), except for a few sections in [[Nanchong]] and [[Guang'an]], where a 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) speed limit is enforced. At [[Linshui County]], [[Guang'an]], the expressway encounters [[G65 Baotou-Maoming Expressway]] and turns northwest bound. It then bypasses [[Guang'an]] and continues northwest until intersecting with the unsigned northbound [[Nanchong Ring Expressway]] and southbound [[G75 Lanzhou-Haikou Expressway]] in [[Nanchong]]. The expressway would then continue southwest bound and meet [[G93 Chengdu-Chongqing Ring Expressway]] in [[Chuanshan District|Chuanshan District, Suining]], and bypasses [[Suining]] to the north of its downtown. It crosses the [[Fu River (Sichuan)|Fu River]] and intersects with the unsigned [[Huimazhen-Suining Expressway]]. From there, the expressway continues to the city of Chengdu, where it intersects with [[G4201 Chengdu Ring Expressway]] in [[Longquanyi District]] at [[Luoshiba Interchange]] and proceeds to the [[East 3rd Ring Road]]. The G42 terminates after passing the East 3rd Ring Road and dipping briefly onto the [[East Erxianqiao Road]].
