''International Organization for the Study of Organized Crime''.</ref> writing about local Italian phenomena like the 'ndrangheta, Cosa Nostra and the Camorra.

His latest publications include ''Made men: Mafia Culture and the Power of Symbols, Rituals, and Myth,'' (2013) which attempts to deconstruct the myth propagated by cinema, television and the media of mafiosi as men of honour and ''Dire e non dire'' (Saying and Not Saying, 2012), which analyses the use of language, behavioural norms and rules associated with those involved in organised crime.
