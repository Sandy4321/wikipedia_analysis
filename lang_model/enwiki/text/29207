The '''Wippra Dam''' or '''Wipper Dam''' ({{lang-de|Talsperre-Wippra}} or ''Wippertalsperre'') is a [[dam]] on the river [[Wipper (Harz)|Wipper]] in the [[Harz mountains]]. It lies near [[Wippra]], not far from [[Mansfeld]] and [[Hettstedt]] in [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It was built between February 1951 and November 1952.

It was built in order to ensure the supply of [[industrial water]] to the [[copper]]-processing plants in Mansfeld and Hettstedt. Its role in [[flood protection]] is rather limited because it was originally only built as an auxiliary dam. Plans for a bigger main dam further down the valley never came to fruition. The Wipper Dam also generates electricity using [[hydropower]]. The rated capacity of the [[power station]] is 22&nbsp;[[Watt (unit)|kW]].

The operator is ''Talsperrenbetrieb Saxony-Anhalt''.

The barrier itself is a [[gravity dam]] made of  [[concrete]]. Guided tours of the inside of the dam are available.
