'''Cornish Australians''' are [[citizen]]s of [[Australia]] whose ancestry originates in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]], and forms part of the worldwide [[Cornish diaspora]].

==Number of Cornish Australians==
A 1996 study by Dr. Charles Price gives the total ethnic strength of Cornish Australians as 269,500. This is made up by 22,600 of un-mixed origin and 745,500 of mixed origin.<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=the+australian+people+an+encyclopedia+of+the+nation+its+people+and+their+origins+Cornish&source=bl&ots=pQ8ZvHWpKe&sig=QwqYYxU2hVdQyxzv3GhPMdcOUPo&hl=en&ei=uKYMTfG_LJGYhQeC9_G3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=table%203&f=false</ref> This makes the Cornish the fourth largest [[Anglo-Celtic Australian|Anglo-Celtic]] group in Australia after the [[English Australian|English]], [[Irish Australian|Irish]] and [[Scottish Australian|Scottish]].

Approximately 10 percent of the population of [[South Australia]], and over 3 percent of Australia as a whole, has significant [[Cornish people|Cornish]] ancestry.<ref>http://www.busby.net/cawa/culture.html</ref> However, no figure from the 2006 Australian census has been published as to how many reported their ancestry as such.

==Culture==

===Festivals===
The Cornish who moved to Australia brought with them many festivities and holidays. The most important being at Christmas and Midsummer.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>

* Christmas, amongst other things they would bring greenery inside their houses and sing their traditional carols. 
* [[Midsummer]], the 24th June, was traditionally celebrated with fire. Cornish Australians used large amounts of fireworks, described as ''enough to bombard a town'', as well as numerous bonfires. As it was a observed as a general holiday large numbers of community events also took place, including many sporting events, concerts, parades and tea-treats.
* The [[Duke of Cornwall]]'s birthday was observed as a general holiday.
* [[Whit Monday]] was believed to be a more important celebration than the Queen's birthday.
* [[St Piran]]'s Day was celebrated during the early days in South Australia.<ref>Payton, Philip, The Cornish Overseas, 2005.</ref>

The [[Kernewek Lowender]] ([[Cornish language|Cornish]] for "Cornish happiness"), held biennially since 1973 in the [[South Australia]]n towns of [[Moonta, South Australia|Moonta]], [[Kadina, South Australia|Kadina]] and [[Wallaroo, South Australia|Wallaroo]], is the largest Cornish festival in the world, attracting tens of thousands of visitors each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southaustralia.com/9008021.aspx |title=Kernewek Lowender |work=SouthAustralia.com}}</ref>

There have been four Cornish festivals held in the City of [[Bendigo]] since 2002. The most recent was held at [[Eaglehawk, Victoria|Eaglehawk]] in March 2010 and was entitled 'Welcome Back Cousin Jack'(We welcome you 'One and All').<ref>http://www.londoncornish.co.uk/pdfs/spring10.PDF</ref>
[[File:Australian pasties.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Pasties from Australia]]

===Food===
[[Cornish cuisine|Cornish food]] like the [[Cornish pasty]] is still popular amongst the Cornish Australian communities. Former premier of South Australia, [[Don Dunstan]], once took part in a pasty-making contest. [[Copper Coast Wines|Swanky beer]] and [[saffron cake]] were very popular in the past and have been revitalised by Kernewek Lowender and the Cornish Associations.<ref>http://www.cornwall24.net/magazine/kernewek-lowender-%E2%80%93-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-cornish-festival/</ref><ref>http://www.helium.com/items/1366261-a-visitors-guide-to-south-australias-kernowek-lowender-or-cornish-festival?page=2</ref>

In the 1880s Henry Madren Leggo, whose parents came from St Just, Cornwall, began making vinegar, pickles, sauces, cordials and other grocery goods based on his mother<U+2019>s traditional recipes. His company, now known as Leggo's, is wrongly believed by many to be Italian.<ref>http://www.londoncornish.co.uk/pdfs/spring10.PDF</ref>

===Language===
The Cornish language is spoken by some enthusiasts in Australia.<ref>http://members.ozemail.com.au/~kevrenor/kevren.html</ref>

Members of the [[Gorsedh Kernow]] make frequent visits to Australia, and there are a number of Cornish Australian bards.<ref>http://members.ozemail.com.au/~kevrenor/gorseth.html</ref>

At least 23 Cornish words have made their way into [[Australian English]], these include the mining terms ''fossick'' and ''nugget''.<ref>Bruce Moore. Speaking our language: the story of Australian English, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>

===Music===
[[Cornish culture|Cornish]] [[Christmas carols]] are still traditionally sung in parts of Australia, just like in [[Grass Valley, California]]. Cornish Australians have a place in the transnational Cornish carol writing tradition. ''The Christmas Welcome: A Choice Collection of Cornish Carols,'' published at Moonta in 1893, was one of several such collections published between 1890 and 1925 from [[Polperro]] to [[Johannesburg]].  The Cornish also used to decorate their houses with greenery for Christmas, a tradition that was transported with them to Australia.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>

Cornish [[male voice choir]]s and [[brass bands]] were once a popular part of Cornish Australian culture, but this has waned somewhat.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>[[File:Gerry and Ashley Cawley.JPG|right|thumb|Two Cornish wrestlers]]

[[Image:Moonta2.JPG|Robert Street Methodist Church, Moonta|250px|thumb|left]]
===Religion===
Many Cornish settlers in Australia were [[Methodist]] and many chapels were built in the places that they settled. Others were [[Anglican]], while few were [[Roman Catholic]]. Their Methodism was a badge of distinctive Cornishness and also gave them their trade unionist convictions.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref> Most of the 22000 Wesleyan Methodists, 6000 Primitive Methodists and more than 6000 Bible Christians in South Australia in 1866 were Cornish.<ref>Gerhard Leitner, Australia's many voices:
Australian English--the national language, 2004</ref>

===Sport===
There has been much involvement of Cornish Australians in sport over the years. Many playing rugby and cricket at an international level. This has led to the Cornish chant of "Oggie, Oggie, Oggie, Oi, Oi, Oi," taken on by all Australians as "Aussie, Aussie, Aussie."<ref>http://www.walesonline.co.uk/expats/expats-newsletter/page.cfm?objectid=18098816&method=full&siteid=50082</ref>

The Cornish took some of their own sports with them to Australia. [[Cornish wrestling]] matches were a regular occurrence, held at festivities throughout the year, particularly Midsummer, Easter and Christmas. Thousands attended these contests, which were sometimes spread over several days and with wrestlers representing different mining regions. <ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>

==Politics==
The Cornish miners founded the first trade unions, and were instrumental in the formation of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The first Labor party government in South Australia (1910-12) was led by premier [[John Verran]], a Cornishman.

===Heads of Government===

====Prime Ministers====
Two of Australia's prime-ministers are known to have Cornish ancestry. 

*[[Robert Menzies]], Australia's [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|12th]] and longest-serving [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], 1939-41 and again 1949-1966, was half Cornish. Meeting Cornish author [[A.L. Rowse]] in Oxford once, he introduced himself as "a Cornish Sampson on his mother's side."<ref>Rowse, Alfred Leslie. All Souls in my time, 1993</ref> His grandfather was the prominent Cornish trade unionist John Sampson.

*[[Bob Hawke]], 23rd Prime Minister of Australia and longest serving Australian Labor Party Prime Minister. Both of his parents were of Cornish ancestry. Hawke's leadership has been credited with reinvigorating academic interest in the Cornish in Australia.<ref>Rowse, A.L., Glimpses of the great, 1985</ref>

==Immigration==
[[File:Philip Gidley King - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Philip Gidley King]], 3rd Governor of NSW]]
===Early Settlers===

During the 18th Century many Cornishmen were employed by the Royal Navy. People like Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] and [[Edward Pellew]], conscious of their Cornish identity, recruited heavily from their fellow Cornishmen. [[Samuel Wallis]], from Lanteglos-by-Camelford, was one of Boscawen's prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>s and the first European to discover [[Easter Island]] and [[Tahiti]] in 1767. Cornish naval officers played a major role in the early years of the Australian colony.<ref>Payton, Philip. The Cornish Overseas, 2005.</ref>

* [[Zachary Hicks]] - When [[Captain Cook]] arrived in Tahiti in June 1769, to observe the transit of Venus, his second-in-command was the Cornishman Lieutenant Zachary Hicks. After six months charting the coast of [[New Zealand]], Cook headed west in search of New Holland as Australia was then known. It was at first light on 19 April 1770 that Hicks spotted land ahead, so it is that the most south-eastern tip of Australia is called [[Point Hicks]]. Cook hugged the coast until they arrived at [[Botany Bay]], where again Hicks came to the forefront. Rowing ashore in two jolly boats, he was the first of the party to set foot on Australian soil.<ref>Payton, Philip. The Cornish Overseas, 2005.</ref>

====Governors====
After its founding in 1788 two of the first Governors of the New South Wales colony were Cornish. 
*[[Philip Gidley King]] - 3rd Governor, who arrived on the First Fleet as First Lieutenant in Captain Phillips' ship. One of those who went ashore to look for water, he had his first encounter with the [[Aborigines]], offering them beads and mirrors. Botany Bay proving a disappointment, King recommended the location at [[Port Jackson]] as an alternative. Ralph Clark, an officer of Marines, compared the new location with the [[River Tamar]] in Cornwall, 'I cannot compair [sic] any think [sic] to come nearer to it than about 3 miles above Saltash on the Wair.' King and 22 others were sent to colonise [[Norfolk Island]]. This eventually came to nothing and the island was abandoned in 1806. After a traumatic time on the island King went back to Britain to recuperate, leaving Nicholas Nepean, from [[Saltash]], in charge. He returned in November 1791 and in 1800 he became governor of New South Wales. In 1803 he ordered the occupation of [[Van Diemen's Land]] as a convict settlement, there he founded [[Launceston]] named after the town of his birth.<ref>Payton, Philip. The Cornish Overseas, 2005.</ref>
*[[William Bligh]] - 4th Governor, most famous as the victim of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]], he was also unfortunate enough to be the victim of a ''coup d'etat'' at the hands of the infamous Rum Corps on 26 January 1808. He had tried to reign them in, something King had failed to do, but instead spent the next two years in exile on Van Diemen's Land while the colony was ruled by a military junta. He returned in 1810 when [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was appointed as governor. Shortly afterwards he left Australia for good.<ref>Payton, Philip. The Cornish Overseas, 2005.</ref>

====Convicts====
On the [[First Fleet]] 21 Cornish convicts arrived in Australia aboard the Charlotte and Scarborough in 1788. A further twelve were sent in the Second Fleet of 1790, though six died on the way, and sixteen were carried on the Third Fleet of 1791. Some 600 convicts were transported from Cornwall to Australia between 1787 and 1852, 78 per cent of whom were male. Some of the most famous of these included:<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=australia+first+fleet+cornwall&source=bl&ots=pQ8ZsDZmGb&sig=TfiFNvZO2PtZBgpAQUgjeTEuoqw&hl=en&ei=-YAHTYaRHsKYhQfXyLnuBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=australia%20first%20fleet%20cornwall&f=false</ref>

*[[James Ruse]], known as Australia's first farmer, who had been transported from Cornwall in the [[First fleet]]. [[Ruse, New South Wales]] was named after him. As well as being the first to set foot on the colony, he was also given the first land grant.
*[[Mary Bryant]], the famous female convict and escapee, transported on the First fleet. With her husband and children she became one of the first to successfully escape the colony.
*[[William Bryant (convict)|William Bryant]], a fisherman, husband of Mary, also transported on the First fleet. As a fisherman he was considered useful, and put in charge of looking after the fishing ships.
*[[Joseph Horrocks]], founder of the mining town of Gwalla, later renamed [[Northampton, Western Australia]]. He took up a land grant of 100 acres which happened to be rich in copper. He developed the mine and brought in Cornish miners to work it.
*[[Moondyne Joe]], whose real name was Joseph Bolitho Johns (c. 1826<U+2013>August 13, 1900), was Western Australia's best known bushranger. 


[[File:Moonta historic copper mines 2.JPG|thumb|right|Historic copper mines at Moonta]]

===Mining===
The greatest waves of Cornish immigrants to Australia came to mine various minerals including copper, silver and gold. Some of the greatest areas of Cornish settlement are listed below. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries over a third of the Cornish workforce was employed in the mining industry. A mixture of famine and collapses in the mining industry in their native Cornwall forced many thousands of Cornish people to leave their homes from the 1840s. However their skills in hard-rock and metalliferous mining were so sought after that tens of thousands more were sent for over the following decades to build the growing Australian mining industry. This was added to during the gold-rushes, when even more Cornish arrived to seek their fortune.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref><ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgoFxfSTfYAC&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=the+australian+people+an+encyclopedia+of+the+nation+its+people+and+their+origins+Cornish&source=bl&ots=pQ8ZvHWpKe&sig=QwqYYxU2hVdQyxzv3GhPMdcOUPo&hl=en&ei=uKYMTfG_LJGYhQeC9_G3Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=the%20australian%20people%20an%20encyclopedia%20of%20the%20nation%20its%20people%20and%20their%20origins%20Cornish&f=false</ref>

====South Australia====
[[File:Moonta-aerial-view-1223.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of the "Copper Triangle"]]
=====Little Cornwall=====
In its heyday Moonta was [[South Australia]]'s second largest town after [[Adelaide]] and was predominately settled by Cornish miners and their families. Today it is known as 'Australia's Little Cornwall'. Along with the other principal towns of [[Kadina]] and [[Wallaroo]] in the northern [[Yorke Peninsula]] this mining area became known as the [[Copper Triangle]] and was a significant source of prosperity for South Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today Moonta is most famous for its traditional Cornish pasties and its Cornish style miner's cottages and mine engine houses such as Richman's and Hughes engines houses built in the 1860s.  Many streets and houses have Cornish names.  Many descendants of these Cornish families bearing their Cornish surnames still live in the Copper Triangle and the area is intensely proud of its Cornish heritage. Many of the original miners cottages made from [[wattle and daub]] still stand and are still lived in by local residents. Many Cornish subsiquently left the area during the Victorian and Western Australian gold-rushes.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>


[[File:Map the Miner at Kapunda South Australia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Map the Miner|Map Kernow]] ("the son of Cornwall"), Kapunda, [[South Australia]]]]


=====Kapunda=====
Copper was discovered in [[Kapunda, South Australia|Kapunda]] in the 1840's, coinciding with the Cornish potato famine which led to many Cornish people emigrating to the town. <ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>


=====Adelaide Hills=====
Copper was discovered at Montacute, in the [[Adelaide Hills]], soon after Kapunda, and Cornish miners were in the forefront of this development.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>

=====Burra Burra=====
The [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]] mine, or 'the Monster' as it was colloquially known, acted like a magnet to the Cornish in Australia. Discovered in 1845, it proved to be an incredibly rich mine, sparking a new wave of immigration to South Australia. The main township is called Redruth after [[Redruth]] in Cornwall.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>

=====Bendigo=====
In 1881 46.9 percent of fathers and 41.4 percent of mothers in [[Bendigo]] were born in Cornwall.

====New South Wales====
=====Broken Hill=====
Many Moonta and Bendigo Cornish took up mining in Broken Hill.

====Western Australia====
There were Cornish mining copper in Western Australia from the 1840's, but this was increased with the discovery of gold.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>
=====Coolgardie=====
Once the third largest town in Western Australia, [[Coolgardie, Western Australia|Coolgardie]] attracted the Cornish during the 1890's to mine gold.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>

=====Kalgoorlie-Boulder=====
The city of [[Kalgoorlie]] with [[Boulder, Western Australia|Boulder]] attracted great numbers of Cornish both from within and outside Australia, due to their extensive goldfields.<ref>Payton, Philip, Making Moonta: The Invention of Australia's Little Cornwall</ref>

=====Murchison River=====
Cornish miners worked at the Geraldine mine in Western Australia  and the nearby town of Northampton. Their  produce was shipped out of   [[Port Gregory, Western Australia]]  in small  vessels  like the tramp steamer  [[SS Xantho]] and then  transhipped to the port of Geraldton where it  was loaded onto wool ships bound for England as a form of 'paying ballast'.  <ref>McDonald, G.K.
