'''Mount Teide''' or, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], '''Pico del Teide''' {{IPA-es|<U+02C8>piko <U+00F0>el <U+02C8>tei<U+032F><U+00F0>e|}} (''Teide Peak''), is the highest elevation in [[Spain]] and the islands of the Atlantic (it is the third largest [[volcano]] in the world from its base, after [[Mauna Loa]] and [[Mauna Kea]] located in [[Hawaii]]).<ref>[http://www.red2000.com/spain/canarias/tenerife/1teide.html Parque Nacional del Teide en todo sobre Espa<U+00F1>a]</ref> It is an [[active volcano]] which last erupted in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent on the Santiago (northwestern) rift and is located on [[Tenerife]], [[Canary Islands]]. The volcano and its surroundings comprise the '''[[Teide National Park]]''' ('''Parque Nacional del Teide''' in Spanish). The park has an area of 18900 hectares and was named a '''[[World Heritage Site]]''' by [[UNESCO]] on June 29, 2007.<ref name=unesco>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1258|title=Teide National Park|work=World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref> Since the end of 2007, it has also been one of the Twelve Treasures of [[Spain]].

Teide is a [[stratovolcano]]. At 3718 m above sea level, and approximately 7500 m above the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, it is the highest mountain in [[Spain]] and the highest point in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name="gvp">{{cite gvp|name=Tenerife|vnum=1803-03-|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref> (Note: The actual summit stands {{Convert|3|m|ft|0}} higher than the triangulation station, and associated bench mark, which has an altitude of {{Convert|3715|m|ft|0|abbr=on|abbr=on|abbr=on|abbr=on}}).  The island of Tenerife itself is the third largest volcanic ocean island on Earth by volume. Teide is also the third highest volcano on a volcanic ocean island.<ref>Scarth, Alwyn; Tanguy, Jean-Claude (2001). Volcanoes of Europe.

Open University Geological Society, 26-1, 53-64.</ref> The United Nations Committee for Disaster Mitigation designated Teide as a [[Decade Volcano]]<ref name=USGS>http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/DecadeVolcanoes/ Decade Volcanoes - USGS</ref>, because of its history of destructive eruptions and its proximity to several large towns, of which the closest are [[Garachico]], [[Icod de los Vinos]] and [[Puerto de la Cruz]].

Teide together with its neighbour [[Pico Viejo]] and Monta<U+00F1>a Blanca form the Central Volcanic Complex.

==Name==
El '''Pico del Teide''' (The '''Peak of Teide''') is the modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] name attributed to the volcano. The Lunar mountain, [[Mons Pico]], part of the [[Montes Teneriffe]] lunar mountain range, situated in the inner ring of the [[lunar mare]] [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]], was named after this 18th Century version of the name by [[Johann Hieronymus Schr<U+00F6>ter|Johann Schr<U+00F6>ter]].<ref name="Sheehan, William 1816">Sheehan, William  & Baum, Richard, Observation and inference: Johann Hieronymous Schroeter, 1745<U+2013>1816, JBAA 105 (1995), 171</ref><ref>Schroeter, Johann Hieronymous, Selenotopographische Fragmente sur genauern Kenntniss der Mondfl<U+00E4>che [vol. 1]. -- Lilienthal: auf Kosten des Verfassers, 1791</ref> Prior to the [[Canary Islands#Spanish conquest|1495 Spanish colonization]] of Tenerife, the native [[Guanches]] referred to the volcano as '''Echeyde''', which in the Guanches' legends,  meant some sort of powerful figure leaving the volcano that could turn into hell.

==Legends==
Echeyde (Teide) was a sacred mountain to the aboriginal Guanches, so it was considered a mythological mountain, like [[Mount Olympus]] was to the ancient [[Greeks]]. According to [[legend]], [[Guayota]] (the devil) kidnapped [[Magec]] (the god of light and the sun), and imprisoned him inside the volcano plunging the world into darkness. The [[Guanches]] asked their supreme god [[Acham<U+00E1>n]] for clemency. So, Acham<U+00E1>n fought Guayota, and Magec was freed from the bowels of Echeyde (Teide) and he plugged the crater with Guayota. It is said that since then, Guayota has remained locked inside Teide. When entering Teide during an [[eruption]], it was customary for the Guanches to light bonfires to scare Guayota.

Guayota is often represented as a black dog, accompanied by his host of demons ([[Tibicena]]s).

The Guanches also believed that Echeyde (Teide) held up the sky. Many hiding places found in the mountains contain the remains of stone tools and pottery. These have been interpreted as being ritual deposits to counter the influence of [[evil]] [[spirits]], similar to the practices of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] of [[Kabylia]]. The Guanches believed the mountain to be the place that housed the forces of evil, the most evil figure [[Guayota]].<ref name="Sheehan, William 1816"/>

==Formation==
[[Image:TNF-NASAmap-Labels.png|thumb|Satellite image of Tenerife with different volcanic massifs labeled.]]

The [[stratovolcano]]es Teide and [[Pico Viejo]] are the most recent centres of activity on the volcanic island of [[Tenerife]], which is the largest (2058&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and highest (3718&nbsp;m) island in the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]] and has a complex volcanic history.  The formation of the island and development of the current Teide [[volcano]] can be summarised into five stages, as shown in the diagram to the right.

===Stage one===
Similar to the other [[Canary Islands]], and Volcanic Ocean Islands in general, the island of Tenerife was built by accretion of three large [[shield volcano]]es, which developed in a relatively short period of time.<ref>Guillou, H., Carracedo, J. C., Paris R. and P<U+00E9>rez Torrado, F.J., 2004a.

Earth & Planet. Sci. Letts., 222, 599-614.</ref> This early shield stage volcanism formed the bulk of the emerged part of Tenerife. The shield volcanoes date back to the [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]]<ref>F<U+00FA>ster, J.M., Ara<U+00F1>a, V., Brandle, J.L., Navarro, J.M., Alonso, U., Aparicio, A., 1968. Geology and volcanology of the Canary Islands: Tenerife. Instituto Lucas Mallada, CSIC, Madrid, 218 pp</ref> and are preserved in three isolated and deeply eroded [[massif]]s: [[Macizo de Anaga|Anaga]] (to the NE), [[Teno, Tenerife|Teno]] (to the NW) and [[Roque del Conde]] (to the south).<ref name="Carracedo and Day 2002">Carracedo, Juan Carlos; Day, Simon (2002). Canary Islands (Classic Geology in Europe 4). Terra Publishing, 208 pp. ISBN 1-903544-07-6</ref> Each individual shield was apparently constructed in less than three million years and the entire island in about eight million years.<ref name=Carracedo2007>Carracedo, J. C., Rodr<U+00ED>guez Badioloa, E., Guillou, H., Paterne, M., Scaillet, S., P<U+00E9>rez Torrado, F. J., Paris, R., Fra-Paleo, U., Hansen, A., 2007. "Eruptive and structural history of Teide Volcano and rift zones of Tenerife, Canary Islands." Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, 119(9-10). 1027-1051</ref>

===Stages two and three===
The initial juvenile stage was followed by a period of 2-3 million years of eruptive quiescence and [[erosion]]. This cessation of activity is typical of the Canaries, for example [[La Gomera]] is currently in this erosional stage.<ref>Paris, R, Guillou, H., Carracedo, JC and Perez Torrado, F.J., Volcanic and morphological evolution of La Gomera (Canary Islands), based on new K-Ar ages and magnetic stratigraphy:implications for oceanic island evolution, Journal of the Geological Society, May 2005, v.162; no.3; p.501-512</ref> After this period of quiescence the volcanic activity became concentrated within two large edifices; the central [[volcano]] of Las Ca<U+00F1>adas and the [[Macizo de Anaga|Anaga]] massif. The Las Ca<U+00F1>adas volcano developed over the Miocene shield volcanoes and may have reached 40&nbsp;km in diameter and a height of 4500&nbsp;m.<ref name="Carracedo 2002">Carracedo, J.C., P<U+00E9>rez Torrado, F.J., Ancochea, E., Meco, J., Hern<U+00E1>n, F., Cubas, C.R., Casillas, R., Rodr<U+00ED>guez Badiola, E. and Ahijado, A., 2002. In: Cenozoic Volcanism II: the Canary Islands. The Geology of Spain (W. Gibbons and T. Moreno, eds), pp. 439<U+2013>472. Geological Society, London</ref>

===Stage four===
[[Image:Teideform2.png|thumb|Summary diagram for formation of Tenerife through to current Teide volcano.]]
Around 160-220 thousand years ago the [[Summit (topography)|summit]] of the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas I volcano collapsed creating the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas (Ucanca) [[caldera]].<ref name=Carracedo2007/> Later a fresh stratovolcano - Las Ca<U+00F1>adas II volcano reformed and underwent catastrophic collapse. Detailed mapping indicates that the site of this volcano was in the vicinity of Guajara. The Las Ca<U+00F1>adas III volcano formed in the Diego Hernandez sector of the caldera. Detailed mapping indicates that all the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas volcanoes attained a maximum altitude similar to that of Teide - which is also referred to as the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas IV volcano

Two theories on the formation of the 16 x 9&nbsp;km caldera exist.<ref name="gvp"/>

The first is that the depression is the result of a vertical collapse of the volcano. The collapse being triggered by the emptying of shallow (at or about sea level) [[magma chamber]]s under the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas volcano after large-volume [[explosive eruption]]s.<ref name=Carracedo2007/><ref>Mart<U+00ED>, J., Mitjavila, J., Ara<U+00F1>a, V., 1994.

The Las Ca<U+00F1>adas caldera (Tenerife, Canary Islands): an overlapping collapse caldera generated by magma-chamber migration. J. Volcanol. Geotherm. Res. 103: 167-173</ref>

The second theory is that the caldera was formed by a series of lateral gravitational collapses, similar to those described in [[Hawaii]].<ref>Moore, J. G., 1964. Giant submarine landslides on the Hawaiian Ridge. U.S. Geol. Surv. Prof. Pap., 501-D, D95-D98</ref> Evidence for the later theory has been found in both onshore observations<ref>Carracedo, J.C., 1994.

{{clear}}
===Stage five===
The most [[recent]] activity on the island is the NW and NE [[rift]]s and the Pico Teide/Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, erupted material from which partially fill the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas caldera.<ref name="Carracedo and Day 2002" /> The rifts can be seen as prominent ridges running NE and NW through the island from the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas caldera. The rifts are also believed to have built the previous Las Ca<U+00F1>adas volcano, and had a part in its collapse. Since the collapse, eruptives from the rifts have filled the resulting embayment with increasingly [[Igneous differentiation|differentiated lavas]] and finally developed the Teide and Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes, nested in the embayment itself.<ref name=Carracedo2007/>

==Historical eruptions==

Teide is currently dormant; the last eruption occurred in 1909 from the El Chinyero vent. Historical volcanic activity on the island is associated with vents on the Santiago or NW [[rift]] (Boca Cangrejo 1492, Monta<U+00F1>as Negras 1706, Narices del Teide or Chahorra 1798 and El Chinyero 1909) and the Cordillera Dorsal or NE rift (Fasnia in 1704, Siete Fuentes and Arafo and 1705). The 1706 eruption from the Monta<U+00F1>as Negras vent on the Santiago rift destroyed the town and principal port of Garachico, plus several smaller villages.

Historical activity associated with the Monta<U+00F1>a Teide - Pico Viejo stratovolcanoes occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide on the western flank of Pico Viejo. Eruptive material from Pico Viejo-Monta<U+00F1>a Teide-Monta<U+00F1>a Blanca partially fills the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas caldera.<ref name="Carracedo and Day 2002" /> The last explosive eruption involving the central volcanic centre was from Monta<U+00F1>a Blanca ~2000 BP.  The last eruption within the Las Ca<U+00F1>adas caldera occurred in 1798 from the Narices del Teide or Chahorra (Teides Nostrils) on the western flank of Pico Viejo (Old Peak - which is actually younger than Teide). The eruption was predominantly strombolian in style and mostly a'a lava was erupted. These lavas are visible alongside the Vilaflor - Chio road.

The explorer Christopher Columbus reported seeing "... ''A great fire in the Orotava Valley''...," as he sailed past Tenerife on his voyage to discover the New World in 1492. This was interpreted as indicating that he had witnessed an eruption in the Orotava Valley.

Unfortunately radiometric dating of possible lavas disproved the eruption theory. However, radiometric dating indicates that an eruption did occur in 1492 from the Boca Cangrejo vent.<ref name=Carracedo2007/>

About 150,000 years ago, a much larger explosive eruption occurred, probably of [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] 5. This eruption created the '''Las Ca<U+00F1>adas''' [[caldera]], a large caldera, at about 2,000 m above sea level. The caldera is ~16&nbsp;km across east-west and ~9&nbsp;km north-south. At '''Guajara''', on the south side of the structure, the internal walls rise as almost sheer cliffs from 2,100 m to 2,715 m. The 3,718 m summit of Teide itself, and its sister stratovolcano, '''[[Pico Viejo]]''' 3,134 m, are both situated in the northern half of the caldera, and are derived from eruptions subsequent to this prehistoric explosion.

Further eruptions are possible at some future unascertainable date, including a risk of [[pyroclastic flow]]s and surges similar to those that occurred at [[Mount Pel<U+00E9>e]], [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]], [[Mount Vesuvius]], [[Soufri<U+00E8>re Hills]], [[Mount Unzen]], etc. During 2003, there was an increase in seismic activity at the volcano. Many volcanoes e.g. [[Mount St Helens]], [[Soufri<U+00E8>re Hills]] had similar seismic activity prior to becoming active. Such activity is considered as being indicative of magma rising into the edifice.

Teide is considered to be unstable and has a distinctive bulge on its northern flank. This bulge is not believed to be associated with an influx of magma, but the result of a slow northwards collapse of the edifice. Seismic evidence suggests that Teide may be constructed over the headwall scarp of the infilled Icod Valley, a massive landslide valley formed by edifice failure in a similar manner to that of the G<U+00FC><U+00ED>mar and Orotava Valleys. The summit of the volcano has a number of small active [[fumarole]]s emitting [[sulfur dioxide]] and other gases including low levels of [[hydrogen sulfide]].

The volcano and its surroundings, including the whole of the '''Las Ca<U+00F1>adas''' caldera, are protected in a [[national park]], the '''Parque Nacional del Teide'''. Access is by a public road running across the caldera from northeast to southwest. The public bus service [[TITSA]] runs a once per day return service to Teide from both [[Puerto de la Cruz]] and [[Playa de las Americas]]. A [[parador]] (hotel) is also within the National Park along with a small chapel. The ''Telef<U+00E9>rico''  [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] goes from the roadside at 2,356 m most of the way to the summit, reaching 3,555 m. Each car carries 38 passengers (34 in high wind) and takes 8 minutes to reach the summit. In peak season, queues can exceed two hours. Access to the summit itself is restricted; a free permit (obtainable from the Park office in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]], Calle Emilio Calzadilla, 5 - 4th floor) is required to climb the last 200 m. Numbers are normally restricted to 150 per day.

Due to the altitude, oxygen levels are lower than at sea level. This can cause people with heart or pulmonary conditions to become light headed, dizzy, develop [[Altitude sickness|mountain sickness]] and in extreme cases unconsciousness. The only treatment is to return to lower altitudes and acclimatise.
