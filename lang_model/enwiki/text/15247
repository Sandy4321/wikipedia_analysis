'''Secondary Highway 541''', commonly referred to as '''Highway 541''', was a [[Highways in Ontario|provincially maintained secondary highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]]. The highway connected [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway&nbsp;17]] in [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]] with the community of [[Skead, Ontario|Skead]] on the southern shores of [[Lake Wanapitei]], passing through the community of [[Garson, Ontario|Garson]] en route. Within the urban region of Sudbury, the highway served to access [[Sudbury Airport]]. The designation was applied in 1956, along with many of the secondary highways in Ontario. The province transferred responsibility for the route shortly after the creation of the [[Regional Municipality of Sudbury]] in 1973. Highway&nbsp;541 is now known as [[List of municipal roads in Greater Sudbury|Sudbury Municipal Road&nbsp;86]], following Falconbridge Highway and Skead Road.

== Route description ==
The roads that the former Highway&nbsp;541 designation was applied to are today known as Falconbridge Highway and Skead Road, or collectively as Sudbury Municipal Road&nbsp;86. A majority of the {{convert|24.1|km|mi|adj=yes|mid=-long}} route passes through developed urban areas of Sudbury, though portions of it north and south of Sudbury Airport are surrounded by undeveloped lands. The designation began in the south at Kingsway, today known as Sudbury Municipal Road&nbsp;55, but the route of Highway&nbsp;17 through Sudbury in 1973. It progressed northeast through Sudbury, leaving the urban area north of Garson and entering an area with several aggregate [[quarries]]. The route curved east and encountered an intersection; to the east was [[Ontario Highway 541A|Highway&nbsp;541A]] (now Sudbury Municipal Road&nbsp;89) towards Falconbridge, while to the north Highway&nbsp;541 continued. South of this intersection, the road was known as Falconbridge Highway, whereas north of the intersection was known as Skead Road.<ref name="gmaps">{{Google maps

Continuing north, the route passed through a non-urbanized area, though still surrounded by houses at regular intervals in addition to more quarries. At Bailey Corners, the highway encountered [[Ontario Highway 545|Highway&nbsp;545]], which continued to the communities of [[Hanmer, Ontario|Hanmer]] and [[Capreol]]; drivers continuing along Highway&nbsp;541 were required to turn. Now travelling east, the route passed Sudbury Airport and several more quarries as it gradually meandered to the northeast. At the community of Skead, located at the southernmost point of Lake Wanapitei, the route ended at Station Road, with the roadway continuing north as a local street.<ref name="gmaps" /><ref name="1973 map" /><ref name="2010 mapart" />

Geographically, Highway&nbsp;541 travelled through the [[Sudbury Basin]], the second largest [[impact crater]] on Earth as well as one of the oldest.<ref>{{Cite Earth Impact DB

The route of Highway&nbsp;541 was first assumed by the [[Department of Highways]] in early 1956, along with several dozen other secondary highways.<ref name="1956 map">{{cite map

The new numbers are the 500 and 600 series and designate hundreds of miles of secondary roads which are wholly maintained by the Highways Department. More than 100 secondary roads will have their own numbers and signs this year. All of these secondary roads were taken into the province's main highways system because they form important connecting links with the King's Highways}}</ref>
A significant portion of the route followed the Falconbridge Highway, a road constructed in 1937 to connect Sudbury with the mining deposits located in the area several decades earlier.<ref>{{cite book

The remainder followed the Skead Road, which travelled north to the southern tip of Lake Wanapitei.
It remained unchanged for the next 17&nbsp;years, until the formation of the Regional Municipality of Sudbury, now Greater Sudbury, in 1973. By 1974, the highway was transferred to the region.<ref name="1973 map">{{cite map
