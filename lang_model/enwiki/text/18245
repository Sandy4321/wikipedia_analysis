'''Hector "Huck" Macpherson, Jr.''' (born 1918) is a retired American dairy farmer and politician in the state of [[Oregon]]. Macpherson was a member of the [[Oregon State Senate]] from 1971 to 1974 and is best remembered as a primary author of the seminal [[Oregon Senate Bills 100 and 101 (1973)|1973 Land Conservation and Development Act]] (SB 100) which established the [[Oregon Land Conservation and Development Commission]] and statewide [[land use planning]] regulation.

As the [[navigator]] aboard a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] during [[World War II]], Macpherson flew 50 combat missions and was the recipient of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the [[Bronze Star Medal]] for his service, leaving the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in 1945 with the rank of [[Major (United States)|Major]]. Following the war Macpherson took over the family dairy farm and became involved with the politics of land use planning over concerns with encroaching urban development of farmland.

Macpherson is the son of former Oregon state representative [[Hector Macpherson, Sr.]] (1875-1970) and the father of former Oregon state representative [[Greg Macpherson]] (born 1950).

==Biography==
===Early years===
[[File:Macphersons-betty-huck-dave-1919.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The Oregon-born Hector Macpherson, Jr. was the youngest of three siblings.]]

Hector Macpherson, Jr., known to family and personal friends from his earliest years by the nickname "Huck," was born September 19, 1918 in [[Corvallis, Oregon]].<ref name=Gen81>Hector Macpherson, Jr. with Katharine Smith Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations.'' n.c. [Corvallis, OR]: Janet Macpherson Wershow, 2010; pp. 80-81.</ref>  He was the third of three children of the Canadian-born [[Hector Macpherson, Sr.]], a professor of [[agricultural economics]] at [[Oregon State University|Oregon Agricultural College]] (today known as Oregon State University) and his Chicago-born wife, the former Margaret Buchanan Dupee.<ref name=Gen80>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 80.</ref> His father, an academic expert on the [[History of the cooperative movement|cooperative movement]], resigned his academic position in 1926 to dedicate his time to politics.<ref name=Zorn-Mac>Elizabeth Nielsen, [http://archives.library.oregonstate.edu/files/archives/mss/zorn_macpherson_des.html "Guide to the Zorn-Macpherson Bill Collection 1926-1932,"] Oregon State University Archives, Corvallis, OR.</ref> His father was elected in 1926, 1928, and 1938 as a [[progressivism|progressive]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] and was instrumental in a controversial high-profile [[initiative]] campaign for education reform in Oregon.<ref name=Zorn-Mac />

The Macpherson family lived on a small dairy farm several miles outside of Corvallis and Huck and his siblings were responsible for performance of farm tasks from an early age.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 82.</ref> Although nominally [[United Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]], the family was [[rationalism|skeptical]] towards [[Biblical literalism]] and both parents were believers in the doctrine of [[evolution]].<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 84-85.</ref> 

In 1936, Macpherson graduated from [[Corvallis High School (Oregon)|Corvallis High School]] and enrolled in Oregon State Agricultural College (from 1937 Oregon State College, today's OSU).<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 88, 90.</ref> He began his collegiate career in the sciences but switched majors to the OSC's School of Agriculture after two years of study, graduating with a Bachelor's degree in 1940.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 90.</ref> He was a member of the [[U.S. Army|U.S. Army's]] [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] throughout his collegiate years, initially training for potential assignment in the [[infantry]].<ref name=Gen91>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 91.</ref>

===Military years===
[[File:Twining-macpherson.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Capt. Hector Macpherson, Jr. receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross from Maj. Gen. [[Nathan Farragut Twining]], summer 1944.]]

Following graduation, Macpherson applied for a teaching fellowship at [[Washington State University|Washington State College]] in [[Pullman, Washington]].<ref name=Gen91 /> American entry into [[World War II]], which had erupted the previous autumn, was clearly on the horizon, however. Rather than face the prospect of entry into the conflict as a [[Second lieutenant|2nd Lieutenant]] of the infantry, Macpherson instead chose to enlist in the [[Army Air Corps]].<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 99.</ref> He trained as a pilot at the new [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[Santa Maria, California]], but was scrubbed from the pilot program following a rough landing during training.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 99-100.</ref> He was instead stationed as a 2nd Lieutenant of the Army Air Corps at [[Albrook Air Force Station|Albrook Field]], located near [[Panama City]], [[Panama]], where he was placed in charge of the base photo laboratory.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 104.</ref>

In 1943, now a [[First Lieutenant|1st Lieutenant]], Macpherson was enrolled in Navigation School at [[Monroe Regional Airport (Louisiana)|Selman Field]] in [[Monroe, Louisiana]], where he was trained as a navigator for high-altitude bombers.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 116-119.</ref> Prior to assignment abroad he took time to get married in May 1943 to Katharine Brownell Smith of New York, whom he had met in 1941 and corresponded with for two years.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 155.</ref> His military training would be completed during the summer of 1943 and he was dispatched to [[Casablanca]] in Northern Africa aboard a so-called [[Liberty Ship]].<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 128-129.</ref> There he was assigned to the 416 squadron of the [[99th Air Base Wing|99th Bombardment Group]], for which he began flying missions from [[Tunis]] late in October 1943.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 129-130</ref>

In December 1943 Macpherson and the rest of his crew were transferred to Italy, from which they continued to fly frequent bombing missions aboard a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]].<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 132-133.</ref> He was one of a group of a dozen navigators selected for training in [[H2X radar]], a new form of [[radar]] navigation system developed by the British [[Royal Air Force]], and returned stateside for instruction to [[Boca Raton, Florida]] in January 1944.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 133-134.</ref> Training was completed in the middle of March 1944 and Macpherson was again transported to Northern Africa, where he became a member of a 7-man crew aboard a B-17.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 134-135.</ref> 

By early August 1944 Macpherson had recorded his 50th mission as a bomber flight navigator, ending his stint in that capacity.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 136.</ref> Promoted to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] later that month, Macpherson was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his service.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 142.</ref>

Macpherson was then assigned to desk duty at Air Force Headquarters in [[Bari, Italy]].<ref name=Gen143>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 143.</ref> There he was assigned the task of writing a manual on the use and combat applications of HX2 "Pathfinder" radar, which he completed along with two other experienced navigators.<ref name=Gen143 /> He also helped to launch a training school for radar navigators and assisted with mission planning.<ref name=Gen143 /> Macpherson would receive a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his work helping to expand the use of the Pathfinder radar navigation program, a technology which proved itself vital to successful operations against enemy oil refineries.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 145.</ref> 

A final promotion to the rank of [[Major (United States)|Major]] followed, just in time for his return to the United States in May 1945, just one day ahead of [[V-E Day]].<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 148.</ref>

===Post-war career===

Following his discharge from the military, Macpherson returned to Oregon where his father, Hector Macpherson, Sr., operated a dairy farm in rural [[Linn County, Oregon]]. The idea of farming held an appeal to the returning flight navigator and father and son entered into a business partnership in the fall of 1945.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 152.</ref> Funds accumulated during the war years were plowed into the business.<ref name=Gen159>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 159.</ref> At the end of a pre-arranged one year partnership, his father sold son Huck the 180-acre homestead for a modest sum.<ref name=Gen159 /> A growing family and farm consumed the next quarter century, with the farm expanded and modernized during the second half of the 1950s.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 158-185 ''passim.''</ref>

In addition to life on the farm, Macpherson pursued outside interests, including activity in the local Community Club and telephone cooperative.<ref name=Gen185>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 185.</ref> He was instrumental in the establishment of the Linn-Benton Dairy Breeders and Corvallis Milk Producers organizations, and was elected president of each.<ref name=Gen185 /> These activities made the dairy farmer aware of broader political and economic issues impacting farmers of the region and helped Macpherson hone his public speaking skills.<ref name=Gen185 />

In 1962 Macpherson first became involved in [[land use planning]] after the national farm press began publishing articles on the topic.<ref name=Gen186>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 186.</ref> Around the country residential housing was beginning to encroach upon established farm land, driving up land values and making agricultural production uneconomic. In California an alternative had been conceived in the form of special farm zones, which would protect farmers from this escalating problem.<ref name=Gen186 /> Macpherson could foresee a similar situation developing in his own area and was interested by the idea, which he was able to promote through his chairmanship of an advisory committee to the [[Oregon State University Extension Service]].<ref name=Gen186 />

Aided by a favorable resolution of the [[Linn County Chamber of Commerce]], Macpherson was able to help orchestrate a hearing on land use planning before the Linn County Commission, the elected county government authority for rural Linn County.<ref name=Gen186 /> The hearing, at which positive testimony was heard from a broad range of community figures including the head of the Linn Chamber of Commerce, led to an initial appropriation of $5,000 towards the development of a first building code for the county.<ref name=Gen186 /> A county planning commission was established, with Macpherson recruited as chairman, and in 1967 the first land use zoning hearings for Linn County were held.<ref name=Gen186 /> Macpherson would remain active in the Linn County planning commission's affairs, acutely aware of the rapidly changing land-use planning landscape in Oregon.

===Land use planning in Oregon===
[[File:Wvatbethel1.jpg|thumb|right|280px|View of a rural section the Willamette Valley in Oregon's [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk County]]. Rapid population growth and haphazard county development regulations placed prime farmland in danger of destruction prior to the institution of statewide land-use planning in 1973.]]

During the decade of the 1960s, the population of Oregon grew by approximately 18%, with the vast majority of this expansion taking place in the nine counties of the [[Willamette Valley]] in the northwestern section of the state.<ref name=Adler14>Sy Adler, ''Oregon Plans: The Making of an Unquiet Land-Use Revolution.'' Corvallis, OR: Oregon State University Press, 2012; pg. 14. The nine Willamette Valley counties include [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]], [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah]], [[Yamhill County, Oregon|Yamhill]], [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion]], [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk]], [[Benton County, Oregon|Benton]], [[Linn County, Oregon|Linn]], and [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane]] counties.</ref> This rate of growth would increase in the subsequent decade, with Oregon's population expanding by another 26% during the 1970s.<ref name=Adler14 /> This substantial expansion of the population base increased pressure on the state's finite land supply, which impacted land values as residential and agricultural users came into competition.<ref name=Adler14 />

A hodge-podge of local land use regulations had emerged during the 1940s and 1950s when county governments were first empowered to zone land for specific uses.<ref name=Adler14 /> Most county governments showed little appetite for land-use planning, however, with sprawling suburban development which dissected prime farmland an all too frequent result of the lack of centralized oversight.<ref name=Adler14 />

In 1969 the Oregon Legislature passed initial legislature attempting to increase the level of state oversight of the land-use planning process. The law, remembered as [[Oregon Senate Bill 10 (1969)|Senate Bill 10]] (SB 10), mandated that every city and county government in the state to adopt a comprehensive land-use plan and to establish "border-to-border" zoning of its jurisdiction by the end of 1971.<ref name=Adler17>Adler, ''Oregon Plans,'' pg. 17.</ref> SB 10 originated in the powerful Senate Agriculture Committee with farmland preservation in clear view and was firmly supported by [[Tom McCall]], the state's progressive Republican governor, for whom environmental and livability issues were matters of primary importance.<ref name=OE>Sy Adler, [http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/entry/view/senate_bill_10/ "Senate Bill 10,"] The Oregon Encyclopedia, www.oregonencyclopedia.org/</ref> The passage of this legislation made Oregon the first state in the union to universally require local zoning ordinances and the second to mandate comprehensive planning.<ref name=Adler17 />

SB 10 was controversial. The law was challenged by planning opponents with a ballot initiative in 1970, which was defeated.<ref name=OE /> Despite the law being upheld by the voters, the lack of state financial support for the law's planning mandates and entrenched resistance in certain counties undermined the effect of the law.<ref name=OE /> By the end of 1971, the deadline set by the law, fewer than one-third of Oregon's counties and just over 40% of the state's cities had adopted the comprehensive plans and "border-to-border" zoning ordinances required by law.<ref name=OE /> Unable to cope with non-compliance on such a massive scale, the Governor's office <U+2014> which was to take over the task of planning and zoning in the event of failure by lower governmental authorities <U+2014> was forced to grant extensions ''en masse.''<ref name=OE /> Oregon's land-use planning system remained incomplete and in need of more powerful central authority.

===Oregon State Senator===

In 1970 the 52-year old Macpherson decided to make his first run for elected political office, moved by a lifelong interest in public policy and his father's political example.<ref name=Gen203>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 203.</ref> Himself a progressive Republican, Macpherson was unwilling and unable to challenge the incumbent Republican state representative in his district, but saw a potential opening in the race for [[Oregon State Senate]] for a seat held by two-term conservative Democrat [[Glenn Huston]] of [[Lebanon, Oregon|Lebanon]].<ref name=Gen203 /> Macpherson emerged victorious over a single opponent in the May Republican [[primary election]] and then set his sights on the November [[general election]], studying his opponent's voting history exhaustively until, as Macpherson later recalled, "I knew his public record better than he did."<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 204.</ref>

After a bitter campaign during which he spent between $5,000 and $6,000, Macpherson managed to unseat the incumbent by a bare 200 votes.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 206-207.</ref> The Republican Macpherson's election had the effect of splitting the 30-member State Senate exactly down the middle in terms of party representation, 15-15.<ref name=Gen207>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 207.</ref> A two-week fight for the position of Senate President <U+2014> and the inevitable repercussions it would have over committee assignments <U+2014> ensued before Republicans finally acquiesced to the election of [[Condon, Oregon|Condon]] Democrat [[John David Burns|John Burns]] and a split of committee chairs.<ref name=Gen207 /> The election of Burns was not the result of negotiated compromise, however, but rather was the result of a deal made behind the scenes in which Burns crossed party lines to vote for himself without consultation with the Democratic caucus.<ref name=Gen207 /> The situation was tense and bitter.

As part of the political imbroglio following the 1970 election, Senate Democrats moved to investigate charges levied by defeated Senator Huston against Macpherson, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation of his positions during the recently completed campaign.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 206-207.</ref> Although an attorney was retained by Macpherson to defend himself against this charge, a political settlement was negotiated behind the scenes in which Macpherson was seated but publicly censured for having made campaign misstatements.<ref name=Gen207 /> "This let the brouhaha fade quickly from public view, and [it] was barely mentioned in the next election cycle," Macpherson later recalled.<ref name=Gen207 />

Macpherson was made a member of three Senate committees <U+2014> Agriculture, Environment, and Consumer Affairs.<ref>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pp. 207-208.</ref> As a member of the Environment Committee Macpherson attempted to navigate a centrist course between those seeking to eliminate and those seeking to preserve [[controlled burn|agricultural field burning]]. Macpherson helped scuttle an effort to speedily phase out the contentious practice but was instrumental in adding a per acre fee to fund research of burning alternatives to legislation establishing a permit system for the regulation of field burning.<ref name=Gen208>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 208.</ref> 

As a member of the 5-member Consumer Affairs Committee, Macpherson found himself the swing vote in support of the landmark [[Oregon Bottle Bill]], which established a 5-cent deposit on containers for [[beer]] and [[soft drink|carbonated drinks]].<ref name=Gen208 /> He also broke ranks with Senate Majority Leader [[Vic Atiyeh]] by supporting the [[Oregon Bicycle Bill]], which mandated the expenditure of a minimum of 1% of funds each fiscal year by the [[Oregon Department of Transportation]] for the construction of bicycle paths.<ref name=Gen209>Macpherson, ''The Macpherson Family Through Four Generations,'' pg. 209.</ref>

===Land Conservation and Development Act of 1973===
:: ''Main article: [[Land Conservation and Development Act of 1973]].''

According to [[Henry Richmond (activist)|Henry Richmond]], director of [[1000 Friends of Oregon]], a land use watchdog group, rather than [[liberalism|liberal]] anti-growth activists it was Hector Macpherson and a "small group of conservative Republican farmer-legislators" who proved decisive in the battle for the passage of Senate Bill 100:

<blockquote>
"The one who got it started was Hector Macpherson, a dairy farmer who was a member of the Linn County Planning Commission for many years. County planning commissions might try to preserve farmland, but state laws were so weak back then that the commissions were really powerless whenever developers waived enough money around in front of hard-pressed farmers... But Hector saw that the farming economy <U+2014> and a whole way of life <U+2014> was being paved over by urban sprawl year after year. * * *<br /><br />
"...At every critical legislative juncture there was a conservative Republican farmer-legislator in the middle of the reform battle. Hector Macpherson, of course. [[Jim Smart]] and [[Randy Smith (politician)|Randy Smith]] from [[Polk County, Oregon|Polk County]], [[Stafford Hansell]] from [[Umatilla County, Oregon|Umatilla County]]. Salt-of-the-earth types with real dirt under their fingernails. At legislative hearings they spoke with the moral authority of [[Old Testament]] prophets. They're the ones who really put Oregon's land use law on the books."<ref>Henry Richmond, quoted in David Rusk, ''Inside Game, Outside Game: Winning Strategies for Saving Urban America.'' Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1999; pp. 155-156.</ref></blockquote>

===Later years===

===Personal===

Prior to assignment abroad in May 1943 Macpherson married Katharine "Kitty" Smith, with whom he would have five children <U+2014> two daughters and three sons. One of the boys, [[Greg Macpherson]], would follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and father as an elected member of the Oregon Legislature, in which he served from 2003 to 2009.
