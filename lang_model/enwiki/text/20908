A '''catalytic converter''' (colloquially, "cat" or "catcon") is a device used to reduce the toxicity of emissions from an [[internal combustion engine]]. First widely introduced on [[Mass production|series-production]] automobiles in the [[United States|U.S.]] market for the 1975 [[model year]] to comply with tightening [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] regulations on auto exhaust, catalytic converters are still most commonly used in [[automobile|motor vehicle]] [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] systems. Catalytic converters are also used on [[Electrical generator|generator]] sets, [[forklift]]s, mining equipment, [[truck]]s, [[bus]]es, [[train]]s, [[airplane]]s and other engine-equipped machines. A catalytic converter works by using a [[catalyst]] to provide an environment for a [[chemical reaction]] in which toxic combustion by-products are converted to less-toxic substances.

==History==
The catalytic converter was invented by [[Eugene Houdry]], a French mechanical engineer and expert in catalytic oil refining<ref name="Csere1988p63">{{Cite journal | last = Csere | first = Csaba | authorlink = Csaba Csere | date = 1988 | month = January | title = 10 Best Engineering Breakthroughs | work = Car and Driver | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | postscript = <!--None--> }}, p. 63.</ref> who lived in the United States. Around 1950, when the results of early studies of smog in Los&nbsp;Angeles were published, Houdry became concerned about the role of automobile exhaust in air pollution and founded a special company, ''Oxy-Catalyst'', to develop catalytic converters for gasoline engines -&nbsp;an idea ahead of its time for which he was awarded a patent ([[:File:US2742437 Houdry Auto Catalyst.pdf|US2742437]]). Widespread adoption had to wait until the extremely effective anti-knock agent [[tetra-ethyl lead]] was eliminated from most gasoline over environmental concerns, as the agent would "foul" the converter by forming a coating on the catalyst's surface, effectively disabling it.<ref>[http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/petroleum/houdry.html Biography Eugene Houdry at Chemical Achievers]</ref>

The catalytic converter was further developed by [[John J. Mooney]] and [[Carl D. Keith]] at the [[Engelhard Corporation]],<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/15keith.html Carl D. Keith, a Father of the Catalytic Converter, Dies at 88]</ref> creating the first production catalytic converter in 1973.<ref>[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history/En-Ge/Engelhard-Corporation.html Reference for Business: The Engelhard Corporation]</ref>

==Construction==
[[Image:Aufgeschnittener Metall Katalysator f<U+00FC>r ein Auto.jpg|thumb|right|Metal-core converter]]
[[Image:Pot catalytique vue de la structure.jpg|thumb|Ceramic-core converter]]
The catalytic converter consists of several components:

# The core, or substrate. The core is often a [[ceramic]] honeycomb in modern catalytic converters, but [[stainless steel]] foil honeycombs are also used. The honey-comb surface increases the amount of surface area available to support the catalyst, and therefore is often called a "[[catalyst support]]". The ceramic substrate was invented by [[Rodney Bagley]], [[Irwin Lachman]] and [[Ronald Lewis (scientist)|Ronald Lewis]] at [[Corning Glass]], for which they were inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] in 2002.
# The washcoat. A washcoat is used to make converters more efficient, often as a mixture of [[silica]] and [[alumina]]. The washcoat, when added to the core, forms a rough, irregular surface, which has a far greater surface area than the flat core surfaces do, which then gives the converter core a larger surface area, and therefore more places for active precious metal sites. The catalyst is added to the washcoat (in suspension) before being applied to the core.
# The catalyst itself is most often a precious metal. [[Platinum]] is the most active catalyst and is widely used. It is not suitable for all applications, however, because of unwanted additional reactions and/or cost. [[Palladium]] and [[rhodium]] are two other precious metals used.  Platinum and rhodium are used as a reduction catalyst, while platinum and palladium are used as an oxidization catalyst.  [[Cerium]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and [[nickel]] are also used, although each has its own limitations. Nickel is not legal for use in the European Union ([[nickel tetracarbonyl|due to reaction with carbon monoxide]]). [[Copper]] can be used everywhere except North America, where its use is illegal due to the formation of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]].

==Types==
===Two-way===
A two-way catalytic converter has two simultaneous tasks:

# [[Oxidation]] of [[carbon monoxide]] to [[carbon dioxide]]: 2CO + O<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> 2CO<sub>2</sub>
# Oxidation of unburnt hydrocarbons (unburnt and partially-burnt fuel) to carbon dioxide and [[water]]:  C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>2x+2</sub> + [(3x+1)/2] O<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> xCO<sub>2</sub> + (x+1) H<sub>2</sub>O  (a combustion reaction)
This type of catalytic converter is widely used on [[diesel engine]]s to reduce [[hydrocarbon]] and [[carbon monoxide]] emissions. They were also used on [[gasoline]] engines in USA market automobiles until 1981. Due to their inability to control nitrous oxide [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]], they were superseded by three-way converters.

===Three-way===
Since 1981, three-way catalytic converters have been used in vehicle emission control systems in North America and many other countries on roadgoing vehicles. A three-way catalytic converter has three simultaneous tasks:
# [[Redox|Reduction]] of [[nitrogen oxides]] to [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]]: 2NO<sub>x</sub> <U+2192> xO<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>
# [[Oxidation]] of [[carbon monoxide]] to [[carbon dioxide]]: 2CO + O<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> 2CO<sub>2</sub>
# [[Oxidation]] of unburnt [[hydrocarbon]]s (HC) to carbon dioxide and [[water]]: C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>2x+2</sub> + [(3x+1)/2]O<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> xCO<sub>2</sub> + (x+1)H<sub>2</sub>O

These three reactions occur most efficiently when the catalytic converter receives exhaust from an engine running slightly above the [[stoichiometric]] point. This point is between 14.6 and 14.8 parts air to 1 part fuel, by weight, for [[gasoline]]. The ratio for [[Autogas|LPG]], [[natural gas]] and [[ethanol]] fuels is slightly different, requiring modified fuel system settings when using those fuels. Generally, engines fitted with 3-way catalytic converters are equipped with a [[Engine control unit|computerized]] [[closed-loop controller|closed-loop feedback]] [[fuel injection]] system using one or more [[Oxygen sensor#Automotive applications|oxygen sensors]], though early in the deployment of 3-way converters, [[carburetor]]s equipped for feedback mixture control were used. While a 3-way catalyst can be used in an open-loop system, NO<sub>x</sub> reduction efficiency is low. Within a narrow fuel/air ratio band surrounding stoichiometry, conversion of all three pollutants is nearly complete. However, outside that band, conversion efficiency falls very rapidly. When there is more oxygen than required, the system is said to be running lean, and the system is in oxidizing condition. In that case, the converter's two oxidizing reactions (oxidation of CO and hydrocarbons) are favoured, at the expense of the reduction of NO<sub>x</sub>. When there is excessive fuel, the engine is running rich; the reduction of NO<sub>x</sub> is favoured, at the expense of CO and HC oxidation.

====Oxygen storage====
Three-way catalytic converters can store oxygen from the exhaust gas stream, usually when the air fuel ratio goes lean.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Brandt | first1 = Erich | last2 = Wang | first2 = Yanying | last3 = Grizzle | first3 = Jessy | title = Dynamic Modeling of a Three Way Catalyst for SI Engine Exhaust Emission Control | journal = IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 767<U+2013>776 | date = September 2000 | url = ftp://www.eecs.umich.edu/people/grizzle/papers/TWC98.pdf | issn = 1063-6536 | doi = 10.1109/87.865850 | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> When insufficient oxygen is available from the exhaust stream, the stored oxygen is released and consumed (see [[cerium(IV) oxide]]). This lean-ness occurs either when oxygen derived from NO<sub>x</sub> reduction is unavailable or certain maneuvers such as hard acceleration enrich the mixture beyond the ability of the converter to supply oxygen.

====Unwanted reactions====
Unwanted reactions can occur in the three-way catalyst, such as the formation of odiferous [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]]. Formation of each can be limited by modifications to the washcoat and precious metals used. It is difficult to eliminate these byproducts entirely. Sulfur-free or low-sulfur fuels eliminate or reduce hydrogen sulfide.

For example, when control of hydrogen sulfide emissions is desired, [[nickel]] or [[manganese]] is added to the washcoat. Both substances act to block the [[adsorption]] of [[sulfur]] by the washcoat. Hydrogen sulfide is formed when the washcoat has adsorbed sulfur during a low temperature part of the operating cycle, which is then released during the high temperature part of the cycle and the sulfur combines with HC.

===For diesel engines===
For compression-ignition (i.e., [[Diesel engine|diesel]]) engines, the most commonly used catalytic converter is the diesel oxidation catalyst. This catalyst uses O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) in the exhaust gas stream to convert CO (carbon monoxide) to CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) and HC (hydrocarbons) to H<sub>2</sub>O (water) and CO<sub>2</sub>.  These converters often operate at 90% efficiency, virtually eliminating diesel odor and helping to reduce visible [[particulate]]s ([[soot]]). But they cannot reduce NO<sub>x</sub> because chemical reactions always occur in the simplest possible way, and the existing O<sub>2</sub> in the exhaust gas stream would react first.

To reduce NO<sub>x</sub> on a compression ignition engine, the chemical composition of the exhaust must first be changed. Two main techniques are used: exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and [[selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR). NO<sub>x</sub> trapping (with [[NOx absorber]]s) is a third method, but as of yet (2010), is not widely used.

Diesel engine exhaust contains relatively high levels of particulate matter (soot), consisting in large part of elemental [[carbon]]. Catalytic converters cannot clean up elemental carbon, though they do remove up to 90% of the soluble organic fraction{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or [[diesel particulate filter]] (DPF). In the United States, all on-road heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after 1 January 2007 must be equipped with a catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.epa.gov/otaq/highway-diesel/regs/f00057.pdf Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards and Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements]|123&nbsp;KB}}</ref>

Instead of catalysis, a [[reagent]] such as [[ammonia]] pyrolyzed ''[[in situ]]'' from [[urea]], is sometimes used to reduce the NO<sub>x</sub> into nitrogen.  One trademark product to do this is [[AdBlue]].

===For lean-burn engines===
For [[lean burn]] spark ignition engines, an oxidation catalyst is used in the same manner as in a diesel engine.

==Installation==
Many vehicles have a pre-catalyst located close to the engine's [[exhaust manifold]]. This unit heats up quickly due to its proximity to the engine, and reduces cold-engine emissions by burning off hydrocarbons from the extra-rich mixture used in a cold engine.

Many three-way catalytic converters utilize an air injection tube between the first (NO<sub>x</sub> reduction) and second (HC and CO oxidation) stages of the converter. This tube is fed by a [[secondary air injection]] system. The injected air provides oxygen for the catalyst's oxidizing reaction. These systems also sometimes include an upstream air injector to admit oxygen to the [[exhaust system]] before it reaches the catalytic converter. This precleans the extra-rich exhaust from a cold engine, and helps bring the catalytic converter quickly up to [[operating temperature]].

Some newer systems do not employ air injection. Instead, they provide a constantly varying mixture that quickly and continually cycles between lean and rich to keep the first catalyst (NO<sub>x</sub> reduction) from becoming oxygen loaded, and to keep the second catalyst (CO oxidization) sufficiently oxygen-saturated. They also utilize several oxygen sensors to monitor the exhaust, at least one before the catalytic converter for each bank of cylinders, and one after the converter. Some systems contain the reduction and oxidation functions separately rather than in a common housing.

==Damage==
===Poisoning===
[[Catalyst poisoning]] occurs when the catalytic converter is exposed to exhaust containing substances that coat the working surfaces, encapsulating the catalyst so that it cannot contact and treat the exhaust. The most notable contaminant is [[tetra-ethyl lead|lead]], so vehicles equipped with catalytic converters can only be run on unleaded [[gasoline]]. Other common catalyst poisons include [[manganese]] primarily from the gasoline additive [[Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl|MMT]], and [[silicone]] which can enter the exhaust stream if the engine has a leak allowing [[Antifreeze|coolant]] into the combustion chamber. [[Phosphorus]] is another catalyst contaminant. Although phosphorus is no longer used in gasoline, it (and [[zinc]], another low-level catalyst contaminant) was until recently widely used in engine oil [[AW additive|antiwear additives]] such as [[ZDDP]]. Beginning in 2006, a rapid phaseout of ZDDP in engine oils began.

Depending on the contaminant, catalyst poisoning can sometimes be reversed by running the engine under a very heavy load for an extended period of time. The increased exhaust temperature can sometimes liquefy or sublimate the contaminant, removing it from the catalytic surface. However, removal of lead deposits in this manner is usually not possible due to lead's high boiling point.

===Meltdown===
Any condition that causes abnormally high levels of unburned hydrocarbons <U+2014> raw or partially-burnt fuel <U+2014> to reach the converter will tend to significantly elevate its temperature, bringing the risk of a meltdown of the substrate and resultant catalytic deactivation and severe exhaust restriction. Vehicles equipped with [[OBD-II]] diagnostic systems are designed to alert the driver of a misfire condition, along with other malfunctions, by means of the "Check Engine" light on the dashboard.

==Regulations==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
Emissions regulations vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In [[North America]], most spark ignition engines of over {{Convert|25|bhp|kW}} output built after January 1, 2004 are equipped with three-way catalytic converters. In [[Japan]], a similar set of regulations came into effect January 1, 2007, while the [[European Union]] has not yet enacted analogous regulations. Most automobile spark ignition engines in North America have been fitted with catalytic converters since the mid-1970s, and the technology used in non-automotive applications is generally based on automotive technology.

Regulations for diesel engines are similarly varied, with some jurisdictions focusing on NO<sub>x</sub> (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions and others focusing on particulate (soot) emissions. The regulatory diversity is challenging for manufacturers of the engine as it may not be economical to design an engine to meet two sets of regulations.

Regulations of fuel quality vary across jurisdictions. In North America, Europe, Japan, and [[Hong Kong]], gasoline and diesel fuel are highly regulated, and CNG and LPG are being reviewed for regulation. In most of Asia and Africa, the regulations are often lax - in some places [[sulfur]] content of the fuel can reach 20,000 parts per million (2%). Any sulfur in the fuel can be oxidized to SO<sub>2</sub> ([[sulfur dioxide]]) or even SO<sub>3</sub> ([[sulfur trioxide]]) in the [[combustion chamber]]. If sulfur passes over a catalyst, it may be further oxidized in the catalyst, i.e. (SO<sub>2</sub> may be further oxidized to SO<sub>3</sub>). Sulfur oxides are precursors to [[sulfuric acid]], a major component of [[acid rain]]. While it is possible to add substances like [[vanadium]] to the catalyst wash coat to combat sulfur oxide formation, such addition will reduce the effectiveness of the catalyst. The most effective solution is to further refine fuel at the refinery to produce [[ultra-low sulfur diesel]]. Regulations in Japan, Europe, and North America tightly restrict the amount of sulfur permitted in motor fuels. However, the expense of producing such clean fuel make it  impractical for use in many developing countries. As a result, cities in these countries with high levels of vehicular traffic suffer from acid rain, which damages stone and woodwork of buildings and damages local [[ecosystem]]s.

==Negative aspects==
Some early converter designs greatly restricted the flow of exhaust, which negatively affected vehicle performance, driveability, and fuel economy.<ref name="gaisun">{{cite news|title=Kits to Foil Auto Pollution Control Are Selling Well|author=Martin Crutsinger|publisher=[[Gainesville Sun]]|date=September 29, 1982}}</ref> Because they were used with carburetors incapable of precise fuel/air mixture control, they could overheat and set fire to flammable materials under the car.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Bulletin|date=June 14, 1976|title=Catalytic converter still controversial after two years of use|author=Owen Ullman}}</ref> Removing a modern catalytic converter in new condition will only slightly increase vehicle performance without retuning,<ref name="imptune">http://www.importtuner.com/features/0610impp_catalytic_converter_removal/index.html</ref> but their removal or "gutting" continues.<ref name="gaisun"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Some of us can only afford a clunker|publisher=Palm Beach Post|date=February 23, 1996}}</ref> The exhaust section where the converter was may be replaced with a welded-in section of straight pipe, or a flanged section of "test pipe" legal for off-road use that can then be replaced with a similarly fitted converter-choked section for legal on-road use, or emissions testing.<ref name="imptune"/> In the US and many other jurisdictions, it is illegal to remove or disable a catalytic converter for any reason other than its immediate replacement{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}; vehicles without functioning catalytic converters generally fail emission inspections. The [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] supplies high-flow converters for vehicles with upgraded engines, or whose owners prefer an exhaust system with larger-than-stock capacity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mazda MX-5 Miata|author=Keith Tanner|publisher=Motorbooks|page=120}}</ref>

===Warm-up period===
Most of the pollution put out by a car occurs during the first five minutes before the catalytic converter has warmed up sufficiently. .<ref name="National Synchotron Light Source">[http://www.nsls.bnl.gov/about/everyday/catalytic.asp],</ref>

===Environmental impact===
Catalytic converters have proven to be reliable and effective in reducing noxious tailpipe emissions. However, they may have some adverse environmental impacts in use:
*The requirement for a rich burn engine to run at the [[Fuel mixture|stoichiometric point]] means it uses more fuel than a "[[lean burn]]" engine running at a mixture of 20:1 or less. This increases the amount of [[fossil fuel]] consumed and the carbon dioxide emissions of the vehicle. However, NO<sub>x</sub> control on lean burn engines is problematic.
*Although catalytic converters are effective at removing hydrocarbons and other harmful emissions, they do not solve the fundamental problem created by burning a [[fossil fuel]]. In addition to [[water]], the main combustion product in exhaust gas leaving the engine <U+2014> through a catalytic converter or not <U+2014> is carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Wright |title=What Exactly is a Catalytic Converter?

*Catalytic converter production requires [[palladium]] or [[platinum]]; part of the world supply of these [[precious metal]]s is produced near the Russian city of [[Norilsk]], where the industry (among others) has caused Norilsk to be added to ''Time Magazine'''s list of most polluted places.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bryan |last=Walsh |title=The World's Most Polluted Places |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1661031_1661028_1661022,00.html |publisher=TIME |accessdate=2008-10-03 | date=September 12, 2007}}</ref>

==Theft==
Due to the external location and the use of valuable precious metals including [[platinum]], [[palladium]], and [[rhodium]], converters are a target for thieves. The problem is especially common among late-model [[Toyota]] [[truck]]s and [[SUV]]s, due to their high ground clearance and easily-removed bolt-on catalytic converters. Welded-in converters are also at risk of theft from SUVs and trucks, as they can be easily removed.<ref>[http://www.chroniclet.com/2007/07/31/underhanded-thieves/ Catalytic converter theft article]</ref><ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/88793 Newsweek An Exhausting New Crime Jan 9, 2008]</ref> Theft removal of the converter can often inadvertently damage the car<U+2019>s wiring or fuel line resulting in dangerous consequences. Rises in metal costs in the United States during recent years have led to a large increase in theft incidents of the converter,<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23117250 MSNBC As precious metals prices soar, catalytic converters are targets for thieves Feb. 12, 2008]</ref> which can then cost as much as $1000 to replace.<ref>{{cite news|title=Converters taken by car lot thieves|date=July 2, 2009|publisher=PoconoNews}}</ref>

==Diagnostics==
Various jurisdictions now legislate on-board diagnostics to monitor the function and condition of the emissions control system, including the catalytic converter. On-board diagnostic systems take several forms.

===Temperature sensors===
Temperature [[sensor]]s are used for two purposes. The first is as a warning system, typically on 2-Way catalytic converters such as are still sometimes used on LPG forklifts. The function of the sensor is to warn of catalytic converter temperature above the safe limit of {{Convert|750|C|F}}. More recent catalytic converter designs are not as susceptible to temperature damage and can withstand sustained temperatures of {{Convert|900|C|F}}. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Temperature sensors are also used to monitor catalyst functioning - usually two sensors will be fitted, with one before the catalyst and one after to monitor the temperature rise over the catalytic converter core. For every 1% of CO in the exhaust gas stream the exhaust gas temperature will rise by 100<U+00B0>C.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===Oxygen sensors===
The [[Oxygen sensor#Automotive applications|Oxygen sensor]] is the basis of the [[closed loop]] control system on a spark ignited rich burn engine, however it is also used for diagnostics. In vehicles with [[OBD II]], a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O<sub>2</sub> levels. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. If both sensors give the same output, the computer recognizes the catalytic converter is not functioning or removed, and will operate a 'check engine' light and retard engine performance. Simple "oxygen sensor simulators" have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre-assembled devices available on the internet, though these are not legal for on-road use.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://eponline.com/articles/2007/07/01/settlement-involves-illegal-emission-control-defeat-devices-sold-for-autos.aspx|title=Settlement Involves Illegal Emission Control 'Defeat Devices' Sold for Autos|date=2007-06-01}}</ref> Similar devices apply an offset to the sensor signals, allowing the engine to run a more fuel economical lean burn that may however damage the engine or the catalytic converter.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Concord Monitor|title=Check Engine lights come on for a reason|date=2003-01-12}}</ref>

===NO<sub>x</sub> sensors===
NO<sub>x</sub> sensors are extremely expensive and are generally only used when a compression ignition engine is fitted with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) converter, or a NO<sub>x</sub> absorber catalyst in a feedback system. When fitted to an SCR system, there may be one or two sensors. When one sensor is fitted it will be pre-catalyst, when two are fitted the second one will be post catalyst. They are utilized for the same reasons and in the same manner as an oxygen sensor - the only difference is the substance being monitored.
