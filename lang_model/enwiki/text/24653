Bowman would continue to produce [[baseball cards]] as they had since 1948 and resume production of [[Football card (North America)|football cards]] as well after taking a hiatus from it in 1949. Bowman was the only major sports card manufacturer in 1950. The monopoly was short lived, as [[Topps]] would begin producing cards in 1951. The rivalry lasted for five years as Bowman was bought out by Topps in 1956. The following provides a brief summary of [[sports card]] sets issued during the 1950s by the [[Bowman Gum]] Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==Baseball==
===1950===
1950 was the only year in which Bowman had a monopoly on baseball cards - There were no other national issues released that year. This set numbered 252 cards total. As with the 1949 Bowman set, the cards measured 2 1/16" by 2 1/2", quite a bit smaller than what is now considered the standard size for baseball cards. The card fronts feature hand-painted color reproductions of actual photographs.

As Bowman did not have any competition in 1950, most major stars of the era are represented in this set, including [[Ted Williams]]. However, the set lacks big-name rookie cards, which has hurt its collectible value. Unlike most vintage sets, in which the high-number cards are usually harder to find (and thus more valuable), the 1950 set is actually harder to find in the low numbers, cards 1-72. Cards 181 to 252 can be found with or without a copyright line at the bottom of the card's back (the versions without the copyright being less common).

===1951===
The 1951 Bowman card set totals 324 cards. Like the 1950 set, 1951 Bowman features color-art reproductions of actual photographs. The size of the cards was increased to 2-1/16" by 3-1/8". For collectors, this is the most valuable of the Bowman sets and one of the more valuable sets ever issued by any maker, due in large part to the presence of rookie cards for both [[Mickey Mantle]] (card #253) and [[Willie Mays]] (card #305).

===1952===
Three factors combined in 1952 to mark the decline of Bowman:
* Bowman did not radically change the face of its cards in 1952. The images are color reproduction of actual photographs, just as they were in 1951. Only the player names changed, from typeface to facsimile autographs.
* Bowman did not increase the size of the set in 1952, as they had every year from 1949 to 1951. Instead, 1952 Bowman features only 252 cards.
* Most importantly, [[Topps]] emerged as a true competitor to Bowman. In 1952, Topps issued their first full set, in a larger format (2-5/8" by 3-3/4", whereas Bowman maintained the same size from its 1951 set) and in greater number (407 cards, a very large set for the time). The increased size of the Topps set allowed for more information on the back of the card, and the player images were a bit more colorful.

*Bowman Proofs were experimental cards of 12 players from the regular set. They were 45% larger (2-1/2 x 3-3/4 in.) and had black-and-white and color variations with blank backs. Some of the differences with these cards involve picture cropping or uniform changes.

===1953===
The 1953 Bowman baseball card set was printed in two series: 1) a full-color set including 160 cards with some of the biggest names of the day, and 2) a 64-card set with black-and-white images, featuring lesser known players of the time. Bowman increased the size of the cards in their 1953 baseball set to 2-1/2" by 3-3/4", more in line with the popular 1952 Topps set. This was also the first Bowman set to include player statistics on the backs of the cards (like Topps). An interesting innovation in the 1953 Bowman set were the first multiple-player cards: Card #44 has Yankee stars Mantle, Berra, and [[Hank Bauer]], and card #93 features [[Billy Martin]] and [[Phil Rizzuto]]. The set features no major rookies, but it is still avidly collected due to the clean, full-color images of the color cards.

There were four color proofs known to exist. They are the same size as the regular issue with blank backs. The cards are of Enos Slaughter, Warren Spahn, Dodgers In Action, and Ferris Fain.

===1954===
The color images that Bowman introduced for a portion of the 1953 set spread to the whole set in 1954. As with the 1953 set, 1954 Bowman cards measured 2-1/2 by 3-3/4 inches and were 224 in total count. On the back, Bowman added a trivia question across the bottom of each card, as had been done with the 1953 Topps set. The answer to the question ran just below the player<U+2019>s statistics. 

The 1954 Bowman set was printed so fast (due to the competition with Topps) that almost 20% of the cards issued had statistical errors. These errors were later corrected, making for a great number of variation cards in this set. There are several other variations worth noting, as well:
* Card #66 originally featured Ted Williams, but as it turned out Williams was signed exclusively to Topps. The card was later pulled and replaced with a card of [[Jimmy Piersall]] (who is also on card #210). Needless to say, the short-printed Williams is now highly sought after by collectors.
* Also of note are cards #33 ([[Vic Raschi]]) and #163 ([[Dave Philley]]); some versions mention the player being traded, while others do not (the cards which mention the trades are more valuable). To add to the confusion, there is a third Philley card which mentions the trade and also credits him with having played more games the previous year (157 rather than 152).

===1955===
Bowman<U+2019>s 1955 baseball set was its last. The company was bought out by Topps that same year. The 320-card 1955 set features one of the more creative designs in trading card history: Each card shows a color photo of a player inside a wood-grain color TV set. The 1955 Bowman set was also the first to include umpire cards. In addition, a number of cards include <U+2018>personal testimonials<U+2019> from players, such as <U+201C>My Biggest Thrill in Baseball<U+201D> or <U+201C>My Advice to Youngsters.<U+201D> The cards measured 2-1/2 by 3-3/4 inches. The most valuable card is Mantle (#202). This final Bowman set was also the first Bowman set to feature [[Elston Howard]] (#68), [[Al Kaline]] (#23), [[Hank Aaron]] (#179), and [[Ernie Banks]] (#242).

'''1956 Bowman Prototypes''' are 3 cards of then Pirates catcher Clem Koshorek. The cards are each of a different design which were samples of what was preferred by youngsters surveyed in a 'Baseball Card Preference Study' conducted by Bowman. The cards appear in a study report booklet.
