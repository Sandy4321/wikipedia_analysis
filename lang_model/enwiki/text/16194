"'''What More Can I Give'''" (also "'''Todo Para Ti'''" in Spanish) is a song written by American musician [[Michael Jackson]] and recorded by a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] of singers following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001. The inspiration for the song had initially come to Jackson after a meeting with the [[President of South Africa|President]] of [[South Africa]] [[Nelson Mandela]] in the late 1990s. The song was to be premiered at a Jackson concert, but the singer failed to perform it. The song also failed to gain an official release, despite the pop singer having stated that it would be issued as a charity single for the refugees of the [[Kosovo War]], which ended in 1999.

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Jackson rewrote at the suggestion of Marc Schaffel, "What More Can I Give". Michael Jackson teamed and partnered with best friend, business partner and confident, millionaire businessman/executive producer Marc Schaffel. (F. Marc Schaffel) Schaffel who produced and became the executive producer on the project, convinced Jackson to also do a Spanish version of the song as well, and handled every single detail of this quick double production. Jackson and other artists recorded the new version of the song shortly afterward; the other artists included, [[Reba McEntire]],  [[Anastacia]], [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]], [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Beyonc<U+00E9>]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Brian McKnight]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]]. In addition, a [[Spanish language]] version of the song was recorded. Entitled "Todo Para Ti", his lyrics were adapted into Spanish by the producer KC Porter. Schaffel had brought on to the project, three time Grammy winner KC Porter, to give the Spanish version what he felt was to be a different sound from someone who was an expert in the Spanish market.

"What More Can I Give" was scheduled for release as a charity single, in the hope that $50 million would be raised between downloads, sponsors, and donations to aid the survivors and the families of victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The plan, however, never came to fruition and the reasons why have varied between sources and the individuals involved. One newspaper stated that the release of the song was abandoned after part of a marketing ploy by [[Sony Music]] after Jackson started a public campaign against Sony and it's USA music head.

"What More Can I Give" was played on the radio for the first time in late 2002. The debut airing was made without permission by radio station [[WKTU]]-FM in New York. The following year, on October 27, 2003, "What More Can I Give" was made available to the public by way of [[Music download|digital download]] for a few short days. Jackson had the song taken down on the eve of the raid on his Neverland Valley Ranch property, by Santa Barbara  Sheriffs. Proceeds from the short sale of the song went to children's charities.

Schaffel got Friend and famed Brazilian Artist Romero Britto, to design, create, and paint an artwork to be used as the cover for the single. Britto created the "ribbon" piece in bright colors including yellow, blue and red. Britto created 250 of this piece as a special collectors item for Schaffel and both Britto and Michael Jackson signed and numbered each of these pieces.

Michael Jackson recorded the song in both English and Spanish, and shot the video for Marc Schaffel. Even after his death it is believed to be the '"last" actual completed song and video that Michael Jackson had done, and approved for release. It was also one of the only few tracks Michael Jackson ever performed in Spanish and most certainly the last one. Schaffel won praises from Jackson and Industry professionals for the masterful, award worthy final recordings he had pulled off. It was the first time Jackson had completed not one but two projects in a timely manner and Schaffel had proven his skills in bringing it in on time and within a cost margin less than what Jackson had spent on any recording project during the last fifteen years. Michael Jackson had told many people he felt that "What More Can I Give" was a definite contender for song of the year for both the English and Latin Grammys, and felt it would be a more successful as "We Are The World". The Spanish version has never been heard by the public. No official release date for either project has been given since the death of Jackson in June 2009, by either Schaffel or Jackson's Estate.

==Background and writing==
{{Further|September 11 attacks}}
[[Michael Jackson]] originally started writing the song, originally titled "Heal L.A.", with Brad Buxer after the Rodney King verdict and following riots in 1992. The song was worked on throughout the making of the ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]'' album and its subsequent world tour in 1996 to 1997. In late 1997, when work began on the Invincible album the song was put on hold, but its completion was always a passion of Michael's.  Jackson was inspired to finish "Heal L.A." after a meeting with [[South Africa under apartheid|anti-apartheid]]  activist and [[President of South Africa|President]] of [[South Africa]] [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1999.<ref name="McEntire, Gilman Join Michael Jackson Recording">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1449257/mcentire-gilman-join-michael-jackson-recording.jhtml|title=McEntire, Gilman Join Michael Jackson Recording|date=September 26, 2001|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Country beat: Alan Jackson, Lonestar, Hal Ketchum ...">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449695/20011005/jackson_alan.jhtml|title=Country beat: Alan Jackson, Lonestar, Hal Ketchum ...|date=October 5, 2001|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}</ref> The songwriter stated that during a conversation with the then-President, the concept of giving was discussed by the pair. The singer revealed that it was during this interaction that the words "what more can I give" came into his mind and he began writing. With the first version of the song completed, Jackson intended to premiere it at his [[MJ & Friends]] concerts, staged in [[Munich, Germany]] and the South Korean capital [[Seoul]] in June 1999. Ultimately, Jackson did not perform the song at the concerts and it remained unreleased.<ref name="halstead 351">Halstead, p. 351</ref>

"What More Can I Give" was also intended to be released as a charity single to aid the Kosovar refugees who had been forced out of their home during the [[Kosovo War]] (1998<U+2013>1999). Jackson revealed his intentions for the release in an interview with the British tabloid newspaper the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''. The pop singer stated that television footage of the war upset him and that he wanted to go to [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] to hug every one of the suffering children.<ref name="Jackson rejects abuse allegations">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/317992.stm|title=Jackson rejects abuse allegations|date=April 13, 1999|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Pop star's latest song is dedicated to refugees">{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/691148/|title=Pop star's latest song is dedicated to refugees|date=April 13, 1999|publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref> Like before, however, the song failed to gain a release as a single and was not considered good enough for inclusion on Jackson's 2001 ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' album.<ref name="People: Oct. 8, 2001">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000954,00.html|title=People: Oct. 8, 2001|last=Martens|first=Ellin|date=October 8, 2001|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Jagger Exits Charity Show as Jacko Takes Over">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,36367,00.html|title=Jagger Exits Charity Show as Jacko Takes Over|last=Friedman|first=Roger|date=October 13, 2001|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|two separate concerts]] were held on September 7 and September 10 in celebration of Michael Jackson's twenty-fifth year as a solo entertainer (his first solo single, "[[Got to Be There (song)|Got to Be There]]", was released in 1971). Held in [[New York City]], the shows sold out within five hours of going on sale. The concerts featured performances by artists such as [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[M<U+00FD>a]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[James Ingram]], [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Marc Anthony]]. They also contained solo performances by Jackson himself, and marked the onstage reunion of the pop singer and his brothers ([[The Jacksons]]).<ref name="Grant 218">Grant, p. 218</ref>

Hours following the second concert, the attacks on the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City, [[the Pentagon]] outside of Washington, D.C., and a crash near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], resulted in the loss of 2,993 lives.<ref name="The story of September 11">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400425/The-story-of-September-11.html|title=The story of September 11|date=October 19, 2001|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Never forget">{{cite web|url=http://www.adaeveningnews.com/leadercall/homepage/local_story_254110618.html|title=Never forget|last=Graham|first=Charlotte A.|date=September 11, 2009|publisher=''[[Ada Evening News]]''|accessdate=November 11, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Following the events of September 11, Jackson rewrote "What More Can I Give" and expressed his views on the song, writing and music.

==Recording==
"What More Can I Give" was recorded in 2001 by a number of artists. The project had received an "overwhelming response from major artists all over the world", with musicians such as [[Anastacia]], [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Beyonc<U+00E9>]], [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]], [[Aaron Carter]], [[*NSYNC]] and [[Carlos Santana]] offering to lend their voices to the track. The recording process was held in [[Los Angeles, California]] and destinations reachable by Michael Jackson's private plane and mobile production unit headed by Marc Schaffel, who traveled  across the globe with a team to record the different artist. The all-star benefit followed a similar Jackson-effort: "[[We Are the World]]", which raised millions of dollars for famine relief in Africa.<ref name="Michael Jackson writes, casts a benefit ballad">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2001-09-17-michael-jackson.htm|title=Michael Jackson writes, casts a benefit ballad|last=Gunderson|first=Edna|date=September 16, 2001|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Jackson plans record for attack victims">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1548056.stm|title=Jackson plans record for attack victims|date=September 17, 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref> The recording of "What More Can I Give" was completed in October 2001.<ref name="Jackson completes charity single">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1624586.stm|title=Jackson completes charity single|date=October 28, 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}</ref>

In addition to the English-language version of "What More Can I Give", a Spanish version of the song was recorded. Entitled "[[Todo Para Ti]]", the track features several of the musicians on the English version, as well as Latin artists such as [[Alejandro Sanz]] and [[Cristian Castro]], who only appear on the Spanish-language version.<ref name="Credits">Jackson, Michael.

==Live performance==
"What More Can I Give" was performed live at the 9/11 [[benefit concert]] [[United We Stand: What More Can I Give]]. Held at the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on October 21, 2001, the eight-hour concert featured numerous artists performing to a sell-out audience of 54,000 people. Jackson performed his songs "We Are the World" and "[[Man in the Mirror]]", before he and other singers such as [[Rod Stewart]], [[Al Green]], [[James Brown]], [[Sean Combs]] and [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] closed the show with "What More Can I Give."<ref name="grant 220 221"/> Joe D'Angelo of [[MTV]] later stated that the entire performance was held together by Jackson and [[Billy Gilman]], who he claimed were the only two who looked like they knew the lyrics to the song. He concluded that the collective rendition of the song was altogether "choppy and disparate."<ref name="'NSYNC, Michael Jackson, P. Diddy, Mariah Stand United At D.C.

Jackson's appearance during the "What More Can I Give" performance was later edited out of [[American Broadcasting Company]]'s airing of the show. The company were forced to take the action after representatives of Jackson informed them that [[CBS]] had demanded that the singer not perform on a network show before a Jackson special being broadcast on their channel the following month.  CBS executives, however, denied their insistence on Jackson's removal from the footage. They stated that if the singer had appeared in the broadcast footage, they most probably would have been forced to delay Jackson's show, so that it would not appear too soon after the airing of United We Stand: What More Can I Give.<ref name="At Jackson's Request, ABC Cuts A Song Out of a Concert Tape">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/01/business/at-jackson-s-request-abc-cuts-a-song-out-of-a-concert-tape.html|title=At Jackson's Request, ABC Cuts A Song Out of a Concert Tape|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=November 1, 2001|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}</ref>

"What More Can I Give" had been planned for release as a charity single to aid survivors and families of victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks.<ref name="McEntire, Gilman Join Michael Jackson Recording" /> At the time of the attacks, Jackson stated that he hoped to raise $50 million for those affected.<ref name="People: Oct. 8, 2001" /> It was also proclaimed by Jackson's spokesman that the recording would be released as soon as possible, with further reports revealing that it could be made available in music stores within that month.<ref name="Michael Jackson writes, casts a benefit ballad" /><ref name="Jackson Taps Britney, More For Song To Help Terrorism Victims">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448892/20010917/jackson_michael.jhtml|title=Jackson Taps Britney, More For Song To Help Terrorism Victims|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|date=September 17, 2001|publisher=MTV|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}</ref>

After the song failed to gain an official release, differing allegations arose as to who was to blame. The Los Angeles Times reported that the "What More Can I Give" project was abandoned after it emerged that the song's executive producer, Marc Schaffel, had directed and produced gay pornography. News of Schaffel's background supposedly became known to an entertainment television show, whose staff threatened to expose the producer's past in porn. Jackson's legal and management team subsequently sought to end the musician's business relationship with Schaffel, declaring their intentions in a letter sent to the producer's lawyers in November 2001.<ref name="Jackson Taps Britney, More For Song To Help Terrorism Victims">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1448892/20010917/jackson_michael.jhtml|title=Did Porn, Sony Or McDonald's Sink Jackson Charity Single?
|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=July 12, 2002|publisher=MTV|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>

Schaffel disputed that he was the cause of "What More Can I Give" remaining unreleased, and insisted that he was not terminated from the project. (This became backed up by the fact the Jackson, had Schaffel by his side, even during the time that Jackson's team tried to oust Schaffel. Schaffel remained while most of the other Jackson team members left or were terminated.  Within days after Jackson representatives sent out a letter saying Schaffel was terminated, Schaffel appeared with Jackson in Berlin on a balcony during the now famous "baby dangling" incident). The producer declared that it was not possible that he be fired from the project because his company owned the rights to "What More Can I Give". (Jackson's camp rejected the claims that Schaffel owned all the rights, but did admit that the producer was in possession of the master tapes as well as video footage of all of the "What More Can I Give" recording artists in the studio. This dispute was part of a court battle, when Schaffel had to sue to recoup other monies he was owed by Jackson from the two highly successful television shows Schaffel had previously done for Jackson. The verdict seemed to indicate that Schaffel owned the video recordings and recordings made during the production, and Jackson and Schaffel owned the project together.) Schaffel further announced at that time he supported Jackson in his feelings that the failed release of the song was the fault of Jackson's music label, Sony Music, or specifically more so, certain people there who called shots. He insisted that the company had delayed the release of the song so that it would not compete with the newly released ''Invincible''. Reports had suggested Jackson was wanting to delay the release of "Invincible" in order to release "What More Can I Give". Sony music had released reports that they had out approximately $32 million in advances to Jackson for his "Invincible" album, and they were not going to delay the release. "Invincible" was already a few years late in being delivered by Jackson.

Jackson also blamed Sony for the failed release of "What More Can I Give."  In addition Jackson claimed that they had failed to promote his ''Invincible'' album and that the company's chief, [[Tommy Mottola]], was [[racist]] and "very, very, very devilish".

==Airplay==
One year after the all-star recording of "What More Can I Give", it was played for the first time on radio. [[WKTU]]-FM, a radio station based in New York, debuted the song without permission and played it in [[heavy rotation]]. WKTU-FM's Program Director Frankie Blue stated at the time, "This song is a gift to the world. Michael and everyone donated their time for it, and it deserves to be heard. The song is called "What More Can I Give", and I can give the world a song they can cling onto and hopefully make them think about what they can give."<ref name="Michael Jackson's 9/11 Single Hits Radio One Year Late" /> It is unknown how the station acquired a copy of the song; both Jackson and Schaffel were uninvolved with it. Prior to the airing, at least 200 promo copies of the song were sent to the musicians who participated in the recording process, as well as to their representatives. Schaffel stated that he would hate to see the song not being used to raise money for charity, the intended purpose. WKTU-FM received numerous telephone calls and emails from listeners following their unauthorized playing of the song, thanking the station and asking where they could buy a copy of "What More Can I Give".<ref name="Michael Jackson's 9/11 Single Hits Radio One Year Late">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457907/20021002/jackson_michael.jhtml|title=Michael Jackson's 9/11 Single Hits Radio One Year Late|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=October 3, 2002|publisher=MTV|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}</ref>
