'''Samarium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|s|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|m|<U+025B><U+0259>r|i|<U+0259>m}} {{respell|s<U+0259>|MAIR|ee-<U+0259>m}}) is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Sm''', [[atomic number]] 62 and [[atomic weight]] 150.36. It is a moderately hard silvery [[metal]] which readily oxidizes in air. Being a typical member of the [[lanthanide]] series, samarium usually assumes the [[oxidation state]] +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably [[monoxide]] SmO, [[samarium monochalcogenides|monochalcogenides]] SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as [[samarium(II) iodide]]. The last compound is a common [[reducing agent]] in [[chemical synthesis]]. Samarium has no significant biological role and is only slightly toxic.

Samarium was discovered in 1879 by the French chemist [[Paul <U+00C9>mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]] and named after the mineral [[samarskite]] where it was isolated from. The mineral itself was earlier named after the Russian mine official, Colonel [[Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets]], who thereby became the first person to have a chemical element named after him, albeit indirectly. Although classified as a [[rare earth element]], samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and is more common than such metals as [[tin]]. Samarium occurs with concentration up to 2.8% in several minerals including [[cerite]], [[gadolinite]], [[samarskite]], [[monazite]] and [[bastn<U+00E4>site]], the last two being the most common commercial sources of the element. These minerals are mostly found in [[China]], the [[USA]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Australia]]; China is by far the world leader in samarium mining and production. 

The major commercial application of samarium is in [[samarium-cobalt magnet]]s which have [[Magnet|permanent magnetization]] second only to [[neodymium magnet]]s; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above 700 <U+00B0>C, without losing their magnetic properties. Radioactive [[isotope]] [[samarium-153]] is the major component of the drug [[samarium (153Sm) lexidronam]] (Quadramet) which kills cancer cells in the treatment of [[lung cancer]], [[prostate cancer]], [[breast cancer]] and [[osteosarcoma]]. Another isotope, [[samarium-149]], is a strong [[neutron]] absorber and is therefore added to the [[control rod]]s of [[nuclear reactor]]s. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation and is one of the important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include [[catalysis]] of [[chemical reaction]]s, [[samarium-neodymium dating|radioactive dating]] and an [[X-ray laser]].

==Physical properties==
Samarium is a [[Rare earth element|rare earth metal]] having the hardness and density similar to those of [[zinc]]. With the boiling point of 1794 <U+00B0>C, samarium is the third most volatile lanthanide after [[ytterbium]] and [[europium]]; this property facilitates separation of samarium from the mineral ore. At ambient conditions, samarium normally assumes a [[Trigonal crystal system|trigonal]] structure (<U+03B1> form). Upon heating to 731 <U+00B0>C, its crystal symmetry changes into [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal close-packed]] (''hcp''), however the transition temperature depends on the metal purity. Further heating to 922 <U+00B0>C transforms the metal into a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic]] (''bcc'') phase. Heating to 300 <U+00B0>C combined with compression to 40 [[bar (unit)|kbar]] results in a double-hexagonal close-packed structure (''dhcp''). Applying higher pressure of the order of hundreds or thousands of kilobars induces a series of phase transformations, in particular with a [[tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] phase appearing at about 900 kbar.<ref name=sm/> In one study, the ''dhcp'' phase could be produced without compression, using a nonequilibrium annealing regime with a rapid temperature change between about 400 and 700 <U+00B0>C, confirming the transient character of this samarium phase. Also, thin films of samarium obtained by vapor deposition may contain the ''hcp'' or ''dhcp'' phases at ambient conditions.<ref name=sm/> 

Samarium (and its [[sesquioxide]]) are [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] at room temperature. Their corresponding effective magnetic moments, below 2[[Bohr magneton|<U+00B5><sub>B</sub>]], are the 3rd lowest among the lanthanides (and their oxides) after lanthanum and lutetium. The metal transforms to an [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] state upon cooling to 14.8 K.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Lock|first1= J M|title= The Magnetic Susceptibilities of Lanthanum, Cerium, Praseodymium, Neodymium and Samarium, from 1.5 K to 300 K|journal= Proceedings of the Physical Society.

==Chemical properties==
Freshly prepared samarium has a silvery luster. In air, it slowly oxidizes at room temperature and spontaneously ignites at 150&nbsp;[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]].<ref name=emsley/><ref name=CRC/> Even when stored under [[mineral oil]], samarium gradually oxidizes and develops a grayish-yellow powder of the [[oxide]]-[[hydroxide]] mixture at the surface. The metallic appearance of a sample can be preserved by sealing it under an inert gas such as [[argon]]. 

Samarium is quite electropositive and reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form samarium hydroxide:<ref name=we/>

===Oxides===
The most stable oxide of samarium is the [[sesquioxide]] Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. As many other samarium compounds, it exists in several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is rather high (2345 <U+00B0>C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with [[induction heating]], through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method ([[Verneuil process]]) from the Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to 1900 <U+00B0>C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase.<ref name=smo/> Cubic Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has also been described.<ref name=smo2/>

Samarium is one of the few lanthanides that form a monoxide, SmO. This lustrous golden-yellow compound was obtained by reducing Sm<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with samarium metal at elevated temperature (1000 <U+00B0>C) and pressure above 50 kbar; lowering the pressure resulted in an incomplete reaction. SmO has the cubic rock-salt lattice structure.<ref name=smox/><ref name=g1239>Greenwood, p. 1239</ref>

===Chalcogenides===
{{see also|Samarium monochalcogenides}}
Samarium forms trivalent [[samarium(III) sulfide|sulfide]], [[selenide]] and [[telluride]]. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt crystal structure are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state at room temperature upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20<U+2013>30 kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5 kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, but there is a sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume.<ref name=b1>Beaurepaire, Eric (Ed.) [http://books.google.com/books?id=rGDCn4lqmdsC&pg=PA393 Magnetism: a synchrotron radiation approach], Springer, 2006 ISBN 3540332413 p. 393</ref> It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.<ref name=emsley/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jayaraman|first1=A.|last2=Narayanamurti|first2=V.|last3=Bucher|first3=E.|last4=Maines|first4=R.|title=Continuous and Discontinuous Semiconductor-Metal Transition in Samarium Monochalcogenides Under Pressure|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=25|pages=1430|year=1970|doi=
10.1103/PhysRevLett.25.1430|bibcode=1970PhRvL..25.1430J}}</ref>

===Halides===
Samarium metal reacts with all the halogens X = F, Cl, Br or I, forming trihalides:<ref name=g1236>Greenwood, pp. 1236, 1241</ref>
:2 Sm (s) + 3 X<sub>2</sub> (g) <U+2192> 2 SmX<sub>3</sub> (s)

Their further reduction with samarium, lithium or sodium metals at elevated temperatures (about 700<U+2013>900 <U+00B0>C) yields dihalides.<ref name=smcl2/> The diiodide can also be prepared by heating SmI<sub>3</sub>, or by reacting the metal with 1,2-diiodoethane in anhydrous [[tetrahydrofuran]] at room temperature:<ref name=g1240>Greenwood, p. 1240</ref>

In addition to dihalides, the reduction also produces numerous [[Non-stoichiometric compound|non-stoichiometric]] samarium halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as Sm<sub>3</sub>F<sub>7</sub>, Sm<sub>14</sub>F<sub>33</sub>, Sm<sub>27</sub>F<sub>64</sub>,<ref name=smf2/> Sm<sub>11</sub>Br<sub>24</sub>, Sm<sub>5</sub>Br<sub>11</sub> and Sm<sub>6</sub>Br<sub>13</sub><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baernighausen|first1=H.|last2=Haschke|first2=John M.|title=Compositions and crystal structures of the intermediate phases in the samarium-bromine system|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=17|pages=18|year=1978|doi=10.1021/ic50179a005}}</ref>

As reflected in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e. g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl<sub>2</sub>-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm<sup>3</sup>),<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=H.

===Borides===
[[Sintering]] powders of samarium oxide and boron, in vacuum, yields a powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their volume ratio can be controlled through the mixing proportion.<ref name=smb6b/> The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using [[Electric arc furnace|arc melting]] or [[zone melting]] techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB<sub>6</sub> (2580 <U+00B0>C), SmB<sub>4</sub> (about 2300 <U+00B0>C) and SmB<sub>66</sub> (2150 <U+00B0>C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content.<ref name=smb6/> Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240 <U+00B0>C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB<sub>6</sub>.<ref name=smb2/> 

Samarium hexaboride is a typical intermediate-valence compound where samarium is present both as Sm<sup>2+</sup> and Sm<sup>3+</sup> ions at the ratio 3:7.<ref name=smb6b>{{cite journal|last1=Nickerson|first1=J.|last2=White|first2=R.|last3=Lee|first3=K.|last4=Bachmann|first4=R.|last5=Geballe|first5=T.|last6=Hull|first6=G.|title=Physical Properties of SmB6|journal=Physical Review B|volume=3|pages=2030|year=1971|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.3.2030}}</ref> It belongs to a class of [[Kondo insulator]]s, that is at high temperatures (above 50 K), its properties are typical of a Kondo metal, with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering, whereas at low temperatures, it behaves as a non-magnetic insulator with a narrow [[band gap]] of about 4<U+2013>14 meV.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=

===Other inorganic compounds===
[[File:Samarium-sulfate.jpg|thumb|upright|Samarium sulfate, Sm<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>]]
Samarium [[carbide]]s are prepared by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere.<ref name=smc/> Samarium monophosphide SmP is a [[semiconductor]] with the bandgap of 1.10 eV, the same as in [[silicon]], and high electrical conductivity of [[N-type semiconductor|n-type]]. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100 <U+00B0>C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1 <U+00B0>C/min.<ref name=smp/> Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800 <U+00B0>C.<ref name=smas/>

A large number of crystalline binary compounds are known for samarium and one of the group-4, 5 or 6 element X, where X is Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb or Te, and metallic alloys of samarium form another large group.

===Organometallic compounds===
Samarium forms a [[Cyclopentadiene|cyclopentadienide]] Sm(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and its chloroderivatives Sm(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl and Sm(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)Cl<sub>2</sub>. They are prepared by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub> in [[tetrahydrofuran]]. Contrary to cyclopentadienides of most other lanthanides, in Sm(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> some C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub> rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes <U+03B7><sup>1</sup> or edges <U+03B7><sup>2</sup> toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains.<ref name=g1248/> The chloroderivative Sm(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl has a dimer structure which is more accurately expressed as (<U+03B7><sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Sm(<U+00B5>-Cl)<sub>2</sub>(<U+03B7><sup>5</sup>-C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. There, the chlorine bridges can be replaced, for instance, by iodine, hydrogen or nitrogen atoms or by CN groups.<ref name=g1249>Greenwood, p. 1249</ref>

The (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sup><U+2013></sup> ion in samarium cyclopentadienides can be replaced by the indenide (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sup><U+2013></sup> or [[Cyclooctatetraene|cyclooctatetraenide]] (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sup>2<U+2013></sup> ring, resulting in Sm(C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>3</sub> or KSm(<U+03B7><sup>8</sup>-C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. The latter compound has a similar structure to that of [[uranocene]]. There is also a cyclopentadienide of divalent samarium, Sm(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> <U+2013> a solid which sublimates at about 85 <U+00B0>C. Contrary to [[ferrocene]], the C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub> rings in Sm(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> are not parallel but are tilted by 40<U+00B0>.<ref name=g1249/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=William J.|last2=Hughes|first2=Laura A.|last3=Hanusa|first3=Timothy P.|title=Synthesis and x-ray crystal structure of bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complexes of samarium and europium: (C5Me5)2Sm and (C5Me5)2Eu|journal=Organometallics|volume=5|pages=1285|year=1986|doi=10.1021/om00138a001}}</ref>

==Isotopes==
{{main|Isotopes of samarium}}
Naturally occurring samarium has a [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] of 128 [[becquerel|Bq]]/g. It is composed of four stable [[isotope]]s: <sup>144</sup>Sm, <sup>150</sup>Sm, <sup>152</sup>Sm and <sup>154</sup>Sm, and three extremely long-lived [[radioisotope]]s, <sup>147</sup>Sm (half-life t<sub><U+00BD></sub> = 1.06{{e|11}} years), <sup>148</sup>Sm (7{{e|15}} years) and <sup>149</sup>Sm (>2{{e|15}} years), with <sup>152</sup>Sm being the most abundant ([[natural abundance]] 26.75%).<ref name="nubase"/> <sup>149</sup>Sm is listed by various sources either as stable<ref name="nubase"/><ref>[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reCenter.jsp?z=62&n=87 Chart of the nuclides], Brookhaven National Laboratory</ref> or radioactive isotope.<ref>Holden, Norman E. "Table of the isotopes" in {{RubberBible86th}}</ref>

The long-lived isotopes,<sup>146</sup>Sm, <sup>147</sup>Sm, and <sup>148</sup>Sm, primarily decay by emission of [[alpha decay|alpha particles]] to isotopes of [[neodymium]]. Lighter unstable isotopes of samarium primarily decay by [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[promethium]], while heavier ones convert through [[beta decay]] to isotopes of [[europium]].<ref name="nubase"/>

The [[alpha-decay]] of <sup>147</sup>Sm to <sup>143</sup>Nd with a [[half life]] of 1.06{{e|11}} years serve for [[samarium-neodymium dating]]

The half-lives of [[Samarium-151|<sup>151</sup>Sm]] and <sup>145</sup>Sm are 90 years and 340 days, respectively. All of the remaining [[radioisotopes]] have half-lives that are less than 2 days, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 48 seconds. Samarium also has five [[nuclear isomer]]s with the most stable being <sup>141m</sup>Sm ([[half-life]] 22.6 minutes), <sup>143m1</sup>Sm (t<sub><U+00BD></sub> = 66 seconds) and <sup>139m</sup>Sm (t<sub><U+00BD></sub> = 10.7 seconds).<ref name="nubase">{{cite journal|last1=Audi|first1=G|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties|year=2003|pages=3|volume=729|journal=Nuclear Physics A|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf}}</ref>

Detection of samarium and related elements was announced by several scientists in the second half of the 19th century; however, most sources give the priority to the [[France|French]] chemist [[Paul <U+00C9>mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]].<ref>Greenwood, p. 1229</ref><ref name=brit>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/520309/samarium Samarium], Encyclopedia Britannica on-line</ref> Boisbaudran isolated samarium oxide and/or hydroxide in [[Paris]] in 1879 from the mineral [[samarskite]] ((Y,Ce,U,Fe)<sub>3</sub>(Nb,Ta,Ti)<sub>5</sub>O<sub>16</sub>) and identified a new element in it via sharp optical absorption lines.<ref name=CRC>{{cite book| author = C.

Boisbaudran named his element ''samaria'' after the mineral samarskite, which in turn honored [[Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets]] (1803<U+2013>1870).

Prior to the advent of [[ion-exchange]] separation technology in the 1950s, samarium had no commercial uses in pure form. However, a by-product of the fractional crystallization purification of neodymium was a mixture of samarium and gadolinium that acquired the name of "Lindsay Mix" after the company that made it. This material is thought to have been used for nuclear [[control rod]]s in some of the early nuclear reactors. Nowadays, a similar commodity product has the name "samarium-[[europium]]-[[gadolinium]]" (SEG) concentrate.<ref name=RSC>[http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/Interactive_Periodic_Table_Transcripts/Samarium.asp Chemistry in Its Element <U+2013> Samarium], Royal Society of Chemistry</ref> It is prepared by solvent extraction from the mixed [[lanthanide]]s isolated from bastn<U+00E4>site (or monazite). Since the heavier lanthanides have the greater affinity for the solvent used, they are easily extracted from the bulk using relatively small proportions of solvent. Not all rare earth producers who process bastn<U+00E4>site do so on large enough scale to continue onward with the separation of the components of SEG, which typically makes up only one or two percent of the original ore. Such producers will therefore be making SEG with a view to marketing it to the specialized processors. In this manner, the valuable europium content of the ore is rescued for use in [[phosphor]] manufacture. Samarium purification follows the removal of the europium. Currently, being in oversupply, samarium oxide is less expensive on a commercial scale than its relative abundance in the ore might suggest.<ref name=price/>

==Occurrence and production==
[[File:Samarskite-fresh.jpg|thumb|Samarskite]]
With the average concentration of about 8 parts per million (ppm), samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than such element as tin. Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23 ppm, and oceans contain about 0.5<U+2013>0.8 parts per trillion.<ref name=emsley/> Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.<ref name=LA2/> 

Samarium is not found free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is contained in many minerals, including [[monazite]], [[bastn<U+00E4>site]], [[cerite]], [[gadolinite]] and [[samarskite]]; monazite (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%)<ref name=CRC/> and bastn<U+00E4>site are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million [[tonne]]s; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes.<ref name=emsley/> Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it is followed by the US (about 5,000 tonnes)<ref name=LA2/> and India (2,700 tonnes).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/rare_earths/mcs-2010-raree.pdf|title = Rare Earths|publisher = United States Geological Surves|date =2010-01|accessdate = 2010-12-10}}</ref> Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30 USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides.<ref name=price>[http://www.lynascorp.com/page.asp?category_id=1&page_id=25 What are their prices?], Lynas corp.</ref> Whereas [[mischmetal]] <U+2013> a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium <U+2013> has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through [[ion exchange]] processes, [[solvent extraction]] techniques, and [[electrochemical deposition]]. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[samarium(III) chloride]] with [[sodium chloride]] or [[calcium chloride]]. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with [[lanthanum]]. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794 <U+00B0>C) and lanthanum (b. p.&nbsp;3464 <U+00B0>C).<ref name=brit/>

Samarium-151 is produced in [[nuclear fission]] of [[uranium]] with the yield of about
0.4% of the total number of fission events. It is also synthesized upon [[neutron capture]] by samarium-149, which is added to the [[control rod]]s of nuclear reactors. Consequently, samarium-151 is present in spent [[nuclear fuel]] and radioactive waste.<ref name=LA2/>

==Applications==
[[File:Samariumiodide.jpg|thumb|[[Barbier reaction]] using SmI<sub>2</sub>]]
One of the most important applications of samarium is in [[samarium-cobalt magnet]]s, which have a nominal composition of SmCo<sub>5</sub> or Sm<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>17</sub>. They have high permanent magnetization, which is about 10,000 times that of iron and is second only to that of [[neodymium magnet]]s. However, samarium-based magnets have higher resistance to demagnetization, as they are stable to temperatures above 700 <U+00B0>C (cf. 300<U+2013>400 <U+00B0>C for neodymium magnets). These magnets are found in small motors, headphones, high-end magnetic [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s for guitars and related musical instruments.<ref name=emsley/> For example, they are used in the motors of a [[solar power|solar-powered]] [[electric aircraft]] [[Solar Challenger]] and in the [[Vintage Noiseless|Samarium Cobalt Noiseless]] electric guitar and bass pickups.

Another important application of samarium and its compounds is as catalyst and [[chemical reagent]]. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), as well as the dehydration and [[dehydrogenation]] of ethanol.<ref name=CRC/> [[Lanthanide trifluoromethanesulfonates|Samarium(III) triflate]] (Sm(OTf)<sub>3</sub>, that is Sm(CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is one of the most efficient [[Lewis acid]] catalysts for a halogen-promoted [[Friedel<U+2013>Crafts reaction]] with alkenes.<ref>{{cite journal|author = S.

The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells.<ref name=emsley/> The corresponding drug has several names including [[samarium (153Sm) lexidronam]] and its trade name is Quadramet.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-06-06|url=http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/drugs/dru267.html |title=Centerwatch About drug Quadramet}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pattison|first1=JE|title=Finger doses received during 153Sm injections.|journal=Health physics|volume=77|issue=5|pages=530<U+2013>5|year=1999|pmid=10524506|doi=10.1097/00004032-199911000-00006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Finlay|first1=IG|last2=Mason|first2=MD|last3=Shelley|first3=M|title=Radioisotopes for the palliation of metastatic bone cancer: a systematic review.|journal=The lancet oncology|volume=6|issue=6|pages=392<U+2013>400|year=2005|pmid=15925817|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(05)70206-0}}</ref>

Samarium-149 has high cross-section for [[neutron capture]] (41,000 [[barn (unit)|barns]]) and is therefore used in the control rods of [[nuclear reactor]]s. Its advantage compared to competing materials, such as boron and cadmium, is stability of absorption <U+2013> most of the fusion and decay products of samarium-149 are other isotopes of samarium which are also good neutron absorbers. For example, the cross sections of samarium-151 is 15,000 barns, it is on the order of hundred barns for samarium-150, 152, 153, and is 6,800 barns for natural (mixed-isotope) samarium.<ref name=CRC/><ref name=LA2/><ref>[http://www-nds.ipen.br/sgnucdat/b3.pdf Thermal neutron capture cross sections and resonance integrals <U+2013> Fission product nuclear data]</ref> Among the decay products in a nuclear reactor, samarium-149 is regarded as the second most important for the reactor design and operation after [[xenon-135]].<ref>{{cite book|title = DOE Fundamentals Handbook: Nuclear Physics and Reactor Theory|date = January 1993|publisher = [[U.S. Department of Energy]]|url = http://www.hss.energy.gov/nuclearsafety/ns/techstds/standard/hdbk1019/h1019v2.pdf|pages=34, 67}}</ref>

===Non-commercial and potential applications===
Samarium-doped [[calcium fluoride]] crystals were used as an active medium in one of the first [[solid-state laser]]s designed and constructed by [[P. P. Sorokin|Peter Sorokin]] (co-inventor of the [[dye laser]]) and Mirek Stevenson at [[IBM]] research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5&nbsp;nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.<ref>Robert Bud, Philip Gummett [http://books.google.com/books?id=HMx_6FtHBcUC&pg=PA268 Cold War, Hot Science: Applied Research in Britain's Defence Laboratories, 1945<U+2013>1990], NMSI Trading Ltd, 2002 ISBN 1900747472 p. 268</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sorokin|first1=P.

Another samarium-based laser became the first saturated [[X-ray laser]] operating at wavelengths shorter than 10 nanometers. It provided 50-picosecond pulses at 7.3 and 6.8&nbsp;nm suitable for applications in [[holography]], high-resolution [[microscopy]] of biological specimens, [[deflectometry]], [[interferometry]] and [[radiography]] of dense plasmas related to confinement fusion and [[astrophysics]]. Saturated operation meant that the maximum possible power was extracted from the lasing medium, resulting in the high peak energy of 0.3 mJ. The active medium was samarium plasma produced by irradiating samarium-coated glass with a pulsed infrared [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd-glass laser]] (wavelength ~1.05&nbsp;<U+00B5>m).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=J.|title=A Saturated X-ray Laser Beam at 7 Nanometers|journal=Science|volume=276|pages=1097|year=1997|doi=10.1126/science.276.5315.1097}}</ref>

The analysis of relative concentrations of samarium and neodymium isotopes <sup>147</sup>Sm, <sup>144</sup>Nd and <sup>143</sup>Nd allows the determination of the age and origin of rocks and meteorites in [[samarium-neodymium dating]]. Both elements are lanthanides and have very similar physical and chemical properties. Therefore, Sm-Nd dating is either insensitive to partitioning of the marker elements during various geological processes, or such partitioning can well be understood and modeled from the [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the involved elements.<ref>Robert Bowen, H -G Attendorn [http://books.google.com/books?id=k90iAnFereYC&pg=PA270 Isotopes in the Earth Sciences], Springer, 1988, ISBN 0412537109, pp. 270 ff</ref>

==Health issues==
Samarium metal has no biological role in human body. Its salts stimulate metabolism, but it is unclear whether this is the effect of samarium or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50 micrograms, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8 micrograms per liter being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.<ref name=emsley>{{cite book|title = Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|last = Emsley|first = John|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2001|location = Oxford, England, UK|isbn = 0198503407|chapter = Samarium|pages = 371<U+2013>374|url = http://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&pg=PA371}}</ref>

When ingested, only about 0.05% of samarium salts is absorbed into the bloodstream and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited on the surface of the bones where it remains for about 10 years; the balance 10% is excreted.<ref name=LA2>[http://www.ead.anl.gov/pub/doc/curium.pdf Human Health Fact Sheet on Samarium], Los Alamos National Laboratory</ref>
