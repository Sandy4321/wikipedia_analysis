The '''Goths''' ({{lang-got|Gutans}}, {{lang-non|Gotar}}; {{lang-de|Goten}}), were an [[East Germanic tribes|East Germanic tribe]] of [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] origin who played an important role in the history of the [[Roman Empire]] after they appeared on its lower [[Danube]] frontier in the [[3rd century]]. Their language, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is the oldest attested [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]. Throughout their history, the Goths founded several powerful kingdoms in [[Europe]], and played the major role in the defeat of the [[Huns]] and the initiation of the [[Reconquista]]. 

The first recorded incursion of Goths into the Roman Empire took place in 238. Written records about the Goths prior to this date are scarce. The most important source is [[Jordanes]]<U+2019> 6th-century, semi-fictional ''[[Getica]]'' which describes a migration from [[Scandza]], believed to be located somewhere in modern [[G<U+00F6>taland]] ([[Sweden]]), to [[Gothiscandza]], which is believed to be the lower [[Vistula]] region in modern [[Pomerania]] ([[Poland]]), and from there to the coast of the [[Black Sea]]. The Pomeranian [[Wielbark culture]] and the [[Chernyakhov culture]] northeast of the lower Danube are widely believed to be the archaeological traces of this migration. Centered around their capital [[Arheimar]] at the [[Dnieper]], the Goths established a vast [[empire]] referred to as [[Oium]], which at it's peak stretched from the [[Danube]] tot he [[Volga]] river, and from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=kfv6HKXErqAC&pg=PA575&dq=ostrogoths+encyclopedia+of+european+peopel&hl=no&ei=NcpGTqveM83usgbLm62hBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22baltic%20sea%20and%20east%20to%20the%20volga%20river%22&f=false</ref><ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434454/Ostrogoth</ref> In the mid 3rd century the Goths launched several raids against the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Balkans]], conquered [[Dacia]] and launched several [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] expeditions into the [[Aegean sea|Aegean]], [[mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[Black sea]].<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=gRE0q38Nb70C&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+decline+and+fall+of+the+roman+empire&hl=no&ei=blL6TYnOIsvcsgb8muEH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=twenty%20thousand%20barbarians&f=false</ref>

During the third and fourth centuries, the Goths were divided into at least two distinct group separated by the [[Dniester River]], the [[Thervingi]], ruled by the [[Amali|Amali dynasty]] and the [[Greuthungi]], ruled by the [[Balti dynasty]]. They repeatedly attacked the [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Gothic War (376<U+2013>382)|Gothic war of 375<U+2013>82]]. In the late fourth century, the [[Huns]] invaded the Gothic region from the east. While many Goths were subdued and integrated into the [[Hunnic Empire]], others were pushed towards the [[Roman Empire]] and converted to [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Christianity]] by the half-Gothic missionary [[Wulfila]], who devised a [[Gothic alphabet]] to [[Wulfila Bible|translate the Bible]]. The Goths would finally conquer the Huns at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454.

In the fifth and sixth centuries, the Goths separated into two tribes, the [[Visigoths]] and the [[Ostrogoths]]. Both established powerful successor states of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In Italy the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] was established by [[Theodoric the Great]]. The Ostrogothic nobles were defeated by the forces of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the devastating 20-year-long [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>554)|Gothic war of 535<U+2013>54]] which ruined the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] economy and caused up millions of deaths,<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=Sc6k5YCymvwC&pg=PA11&dq=gothic+war+million+casualties&hl=no&ei=YYn6TfKAAZHIswba-ZEN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=15%2C000%2C000&f=false</ref> only to result in [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Lombards|Lombardic]] conquest 10 years later. The Visigoths under [[Alaric I]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. Their fifth-century [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in [[Aquitaine]] was [[Battle of Vouill<U+00E9>|pushed to]] [[Hispania]] by the [[Frankish Kingdom|Franks]] in 507, converted to [[Catholicism]] by the late sixth century, and in the early eighth century fell to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim Moors]]. Subsequently, under the leadership of the Gothic nobleman [[Pelagius]], the Visigothic nobles managed to establish the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and would later be credited with the initiation of the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Crusades]] with the victory over the [[Moors]] at the [[Battle of Covadonga]].<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557573/Spain/70360/The-Christian-states-711-1035</ref>

While its influence continued to be felt in small ways in some west European states, the Gothic language and culture largely disappeared during the Middle Ages. In the 16th century a small remnant of a Gothic dialect known as [[Crimean Gothic]] was described as surviving in the [[Crimea]].<ref>{{citation | last = Bennett | first = William H | year = 1980 | title = An Introduction to the Gothic Language | page = 27}}.</ref>

{{See|Gaut}}
The Goths have had many names, possibly due to their population being composed of many separate ethnic groups. People known by similar names were key elements of Proto-Indo-European and later [[Germanic migrations]]. Nevertheless, they believed (as does the mainstream of scholarship)<ref>{{citation | last = Wolfram | year = 1988 | pages = 19<U+2013>35}}.</ref> that the names derived from a single prehistoric [[ethnonym]] owned by a [[Pre-Roman Iron Age#Expansion|uniform culture]] in the middle 1st millennium BC, the original "Goths".

Etymologically, the ethnonym of the Goths derives from the stem ''Guton-''",<ref name=lehmann164>{{citation |first=Winfred P.|last=Lehmann| authorlink= Winfred P. Lehmann|coauthors=Helen-Jo J. Hewitt|title=A Gothic Etymological Dictionary|publisher=E.J. Brill|year=1986|location= Leiden |isbn= 9004081763, 9789004081765|pages=164}}; apparent in the name of the ''Gutones'' mentioned in a quotation of [[Pytheas]] cited by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].</ref> which gave [[Proto-Germanic]] *''Gutaniz'' (also surviving in [[Gutes]], the self-designation of the inhabitans of [[Gotland]] in [[Sweden]]). Related, but not identical, is the Scandinavian tribal name [[Geat]], from the Proto-Germanic *''Gautoz'' (plural *''Gautaz''). Both *''Gautoz'' and *''Gutaniz'' are derived (specifically they are two [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]] grades) from the Proto-Germanic word *''geutan'', meaning "to pour".<ref>Compare the modern Swedish ''gjuta'', modern Dutch ''gieten'', modern German ''gie<U+00DF>en'', Gothic ''giutan'', old Scandinavian ''giota'', old English ''geotan'' all cognate with Latin ''fondere'' "to pour" and old Greek ''cheo'' "I pour".</ref> The [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root of the "pour" derivation would be *gheu-d-<ref name = "Bartleby 165">{{citation | url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE165.html | publisher = Bartleby | title = Roots | page = 165}}.</ref> as it is listed in the [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]] (AHD). *gheu-d- is a [[centum]] form. The AHD relies on [[Julius Pokorny]] for the same root.<ref>{{citation | title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language | page = 447}}.</ref> The ethnonym has been connected with the name of a river flowing through [[V<U+00E4>sterg<U+00F6>tland]] in [[Sweden]], the [[G<U+00F6>ta <U+00E4>lv]], which drains Lake [[V<U+00E4>nern]] into the [[Kattegat]].<ref>{{citation | last = Wolfram | year = 1988 | page = 21}}.</ref>

[[Old Norse]] records do not distinguish between the Goths and the [[Gutes]] (Gotlanders) and both are called ''Gotar'' in Old West [[Old Norse language|Norse]]. The Old East [[Old Norse language|Norse]] term for both Goths and [[Gotlander]]s seems to have been ''Gutar'' (for instance, in the [[Gutasaga]] and in the runic inscription of the [[R<U+00F6>kstone]]). However, the [[Geats]] are clearly differentiated from the Goths, or Gutes, in both Old Norse and Old English literature.

At some time in European prehistory, consonant changes according to [[Grimm's Law]] created a *g from the *gh and a *t from the *d. This same law more or less rules out *ghedh-,<ref name = "Bartleby 155">{{citation | url = http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE155.html | publisher = Bartleby | title = Roots | page = 155}}.</ref> The *dh in that case would become a *d instead of a *t.

According to the rules of [[Indo-European ablaut]], the full grade (containing an *e), *gheud-, might be replaced with the zero-grade (the *e disappears), *ghud-, or the o-grade (the *e changes to an *o), *ghoud-, accounting for the various forms of the name. The zero-grade is preserved in modern times in the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ethnonym for [[Belarusians]], ''Gudai'' (earlier Baltic [[Prussia]]n territory before Slavic conquests by about 1200 CE), and in certain Prussian towns in the territory around the [[Vistula River]] in [[Gothiscandza]], today Poland ([[Gdynia]], [[Gdansk]]). The use of all three grades suggests that the name derives from an Indo-European stage; otherwise, it would be from a line descending from one grade. However, when and where the ancestors of the Goths assigned this name to themselves and whether they used it in [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] or [[proto-Germanic]] times remain unsolved questions of historical linguistics and prehistoric archaeology.

A compound name, ''Gut-<U+00FE>iuda'', at root the "Gothic people", appears in the ''Gothic Calendar'' (''aikklesjons fullaizos ana '''gut<U+00FE>iudai''' gabrannidai''). Parallel occurrences indicate that it may mean "country of the Goths": Old Icelandic ''Sui-<U+00FE>j<U+00F2>d'', "Sweden"; Old English ''Angel-<U+00FE><U+0113>od'', "Anglia"; Old Irish ''Cruithen-tuath'', <U+201C>country of the Picts<U+201D>.<ref name= lehmann164 /> Evidently, this way of forming a country or people name is not unique to Germanic.

===Written sources <U+2013> Tacitus, Jordanes and Pliny===
[[Image:Roman Empire 125.png|thumb|right|The Roman empire, under [[Hadrian]] <!-- (ruled 117<U+2013>38), according to [[Tacitus|Tacitus's]] [[Germania (book)|Germania]] (written ca.

[[Tacitus]] described the Goths as well as the neighboring [[Rugii]] and [[Lemovii]] as carrying round shields and short swords, and obeying their regular authority.<ref name = "Hoops452ff">{{citation | first = Johannes | last = Hoops | first1 = Herbert | last1 = Jankuhn | first2 = Heinrich | last2 = Beck | first3 = Dieter | last3 = Geuenich | first4 = Heiko | last4 = Steuer | title = Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde | edition = 2nd | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2004 | pages = 452ff | id = ISBN 3110177331 | language = German}}.</ref><ref name="Oxfordtranslation836">{{citation | title = The Works of Tacitus: the Oxford Translation, Revised, with Notes | publisher = BiblioBazaar | year = 2008| page = 836 | id = 0559473354}}.</ref><ref name= "Rives311">{{citation | first = JB | last = Rives | title = On Tacitus, Germania | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1999 | page = 311 | id = ISBN 0198150504}}.</ref>

According to [[Jordanes]]<U+2019> [[Getica]], written in the mid-6th century, the earliest migrating Goths sailed from [[Scandza]] under King [[Berig]]<ref name = "Jordanes 25">{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 25}}.</ref> in three ships<ref>{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 94}}.</ref> and named the place at which they landed after themselves. "Today {{interp |says Jordanes}} it is called [[Gothiscandza]]" ("Scandza of the Goths").<ref name = "Jordanes 26">{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 26}}.</ref> From there they entered the land of the [[Rugians|"Ulmerugi" (Rugii)]] who were spread along the southern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], expelled them,<ref name = "Hoops452ff" /> and also subdued the neighboring [[Vandals]].

Regarding the location of Gothiscandza, Jordanes states<ref name = "Jordanes 96">{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 96}}.</ref> that one shipload "dwelled in the province of Spesis on an island surrounded by the shallow waters of the [[Vistula]]." Today's [[Gdansk]], a large city, is located at the mouth of the Vistula. However, as the terrain has changed due to the deposition of mud, archaeological efforts have been frustrated and the origin of the city remains undetermined. The city's name is generally considered to be derived from "Goth" but not necessarily from Gothiscandza. Thus, Jordanes<U+2019> story cannot be ruled out as a legend of the origin of Gdansk.

Independent confirmation of Jordanes' account requires confirmation itself in some cases: specifically, the passage attributed by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]<ref>{{citation | first = Pliny | last = the Elder | volume = 37 | chapter = 11}}.</ref> to the voyager [[Pytheas]]. In this passage, Pytheas states that the "Gutones, a people of Germany," inhabit the shores of an estuary of at least 6,000 [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] (the [[Baltic Sea]]) called Mentonomon, where [[amber]] is cast up by the waves. Lehmann (mentioned above under ''Etymology'') accepted this view but a manuscript variant states Guiones rather than Gutones.<ref>{{Citation|page =113|title=Germania|first= Cornelius | last = Tacitus | authorlink=Cornelius Tacitus|coauthors=JB Rives, translator and commentator|publisher=Oxford University Press|location = Oxford | year = 1999 | isbn=0199240000, 9780199240005}}. As Pytheas did mention the Teutones in the same passage, it securely dates them to 300 BC.</ref> No other mention of the Guiones has yet been found.

In Pliny's only other mention of the Gutones,<ref name = "Pliny 4 13">{{citation | first = Pliny | last = the Elder | volume = 4 | chapter = 13}}.</ref> he states that the [[Vandals]] are one of the five races of Germany, and that the Vandals include the Burgodiones, the Varinnae, the Charini and the Gutones. The location of those Vandals is not stated, but there is a match with his contemporary [[Ptolemy]]'s east German tribes.<ref name = "Ptolomy II 10">{{citation | last = Ptolomy | volume = II | chapter = 10}}.</ref> As those Gutones are put forward as Pliny's interpretation, not Pytheas<U+2019>, the early date is unconfirmed, but not necessarily invalid.

===Archaeological records <U+2013> Wielbark Culture===
{{Main|Wielbark Culture}}
{{See|Early history of Pomerania}}
[[Image:Chernyakhov.PNG|right|thumb|The dark pink area is the island of [[Gotland]]. The green area is the traditional extent of [[G<U+00F6>taland]]. The red area is the extent of the [[Wielbark culture]] in the early 3rd century, and the orange area is the [[Chernyakhov culture]], in the early 4th century. The purple area is the [[Roman Empire]]]]
The earliest material culture associated with the Goths on the southern coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] is the [[Wielbark Culture]],<ref name = "gbvlfd">{{citation | url = http://www.muzarp.poznan.pl/archweb/gazociag/title5.htm | publisher = Poznan | title = The Goths in Greater Poland}}.</ref> centered around the modern region of [[Pomerania]] in northern [[Poland]]. This culture replaced the local [[Oksywie culture|Oksywie]] or Oxh<U+00F6>ft culture in the 1st century, when a Scandinavian settlement was established in a buffer zone between the Oksywie culture and the [[Przeworsk culture]].<ref>{{citation | first = Andrzej | last = Kokowski | title = {{lang|de|"Arch<U+00E4>ologie der Goten"}} | language = {{de}} | year = 1999 | id = ISBN 83-907341-8-4}}.</ref>

This area was influenced by southern Scandinavian culture from as early as the late [[Nordic Bronze Age]] and early [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (ca. 1300 <U+2013> ca. 300 BC).<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/publications/opia/gothicabstract.htm | publisher = Arkeologi UU.se | title = Gothic Connections}}.</ref> In fact, the Scandinavian influence on [[Pomerania]] and today's northern Poland from ca. 1300 BC (period III) and onwards was so considerable that this region is sometimes included in the Nordic Bronze Age culture.<ref name = "Dabrowski 1989 73">{{citation | last = Dabrowski | year = 1989 | page = 73}}.</ref>

During the period ca. 600 <U+2013> ca. 300 BC the warm, dry climate of southern Scandinavia deteriorated considerably. This dramatically changed the flora and forced people to change their way of living. Some settlements were abandoned.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The Goths are believed to have crossed the [[Baltic Sea]] sometime between the end of this period (ca 300 BC) and AD 100. Early archaeological evidence in the traditional Swedish province of [[<U+00D6>sterg<U+00F6>tland]] suggests a general depopulation during this period.<ref name = "Oxenstierna 1945">{{citation | last = Oxenstierna | year = 1945}}.</ref> However, this is not confirmed in more recent publications.<ref name = "Kaliff 2001">{{citation | last = Kaliff | year = 2001}}.</ref> The settlement in today's Poland may correspond to the introduction of Scandinavian burial traditions, such as the [[Stone Circle (Iron Age)|stone circles]] and the [[Menhir (Iron Age)|stelae]] especially common on the island of [[Gotland]] and other parts of southern Sweden.

The Polish archaeologist Tomasz Skorupka argues that a migration from Scandinavia took place: "despite many controversial hypotheses regarding the location of Scandia<U+2026> the fact that the Goths arrived on today's Polish land from the North after crossing the Baltic Sea by boats is certain."<ref name = "jisaal" /> The Gothic culture also exhibits continuity with earlier cultures in the area,<ref name = "gbvlfd"/> suggesting that the immigrants mixed with earlier populations, perhaps providing their separate aristocracy. This scenario would make their migration across the Baltic similar to many other population movements in history, such as the earlier [[Anglo-Saxons#The "Anglo-Saxon invasion" and genetic history|Anglo-Saxon invasion]], where, according to some theories, migrants imposed their own culture and language on an indigenous one. Later Scandinavian immigrants along Russian rivers followed the same pattern, giving rise to the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]].

However, Heather is skeptical of this hypothesis, claiming that there is no archaeological evidence for a substantial emigration from Scandinavia.<ref>Heather, ''The Goths'', p. 26.</ref>

The arrival of Germanic-speaking invaders along the coast of the Black Sea is generally explained as a gradual migration of the Goths from what is now Poland to Ukraine, reflecting the tradition of [[Jordanes]] and old songs.<ref>{{citation | last = Wolfram | page = 42}}.</ref> 

The first Greek references to the Goths call them ''Scythians'',{{Examples|date=April 2011}} since this area along the Black Sea historically had been occupied by an unrelated people of that name. The term as applied to the Goths appears to be geographical rather than ethnological in reference.<ref>Kulikowski (2007), p. 19. Quote: "And so the Goths, when they first appear in our written sources, are Scythians <U+2013> they lived where the Scythians had once lived, they were the barbarian mirror image of the civilised Greek world as the Scythians had been, and so they were themselves Scythians."</ref>

===Written sources <U+2013> Jordanes===
[[Jordanes]] was a man of Gothic extraction living in the Roman Empire. Jordanes and his grandfather had served as officials of Gothic chieftains. According to his [[Getica]], a history of the Goths written in the mid-6th century, the Goths entered [[Oium]], part of [[Scythia]],<ref>{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 27}}.</ref> under their 5th king, [[Filimer]], where they defeated the [[Spali]] before moving to the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]].<ref name="Jordanes 28">{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 28}}.</ref> There they became divided into the [[Visigoths]] ruled by the [[Balti dynasty|Balthi]] family and the [[Ostrogoths]] ruled by the [[Amali]] family.<ref>{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 42}}.</ref> Jordanes parses ''Ostrogoths'' as "eastern Goths", and ''Visigoths'' as "Goths of the western country."<ref>{{citation | last = Jordanes | page = 82}}.</ref>

Beginning in the middle 2nd century, the Wielbark culture shifted to the southeast, towards the [[Black Sea]].

Major sources for Gothic history include [[Ammianus|Ammianus Marcellinus]]' ''Res gestae'', which mentions Gothic involvement in the civil war between emperors Procopius and [[Valens]] of 365 and recounts the [[Gothic War (376-382)|Gothic refugee crisis and revolt of 376<U+2013>82]], and [[Procopius]]' ''de bello gothico'', which describes the [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>552)|Gothic war of 535<U+2013>52]].

In the 3rd century, there were at least two groups of Goths: the [[Thervings|Thervingi]] and the [[Greuthungs|Greuthungi]]. The Thervingi launched one of the first major [[barbarian]] invasions of the Roman Empire in 262, sailing into the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and laying waste to the islands and the countryside in 267; they failed, however, to take any fortified cities.<ref>{{citation | first = Hermannus | last = Contractus | authorlink = Hermannus Contractus}}, quoting {{citation | first = Eusebius | last = of Caesarea | authorlink = Eusebius of Caesarea | page = 263}}: "[[Macedon]]ia, [[Greece|Graecia]], [[Pontus]], [[Asia Minor|Asia]] et aliae provinciae depopulantur per Gothos".
</ref> They suffered a devastating defeat a year later at the [[Battle of Naissus]], and were destroyed by 271. Some survivors were resettled within the empire, while others were incorporated into the Roman army.

Later, an independent kingdom centered on the abandoned Roman province of [[Dacia]] was established. In 332 [[Constantine I|Constantine]] helped the Sarmatians to settle on the north banks of the Danube to defend against the Goths' attacks and thereby enforce the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[border]]. Around 100,000 Goths were killed in battle, and Ariaricus, son of the King of the Goths, was captured. In 334, Constantine evacuated approximately 300,000 Sarmatians from the north bank of the Danube after a revolt of the Sarmatians' slaves. From 335 to 336, Constantine, continuing his Danube campaign, defeated many Gothic tribes.<ref>{{citation | title = Origo Constantini | chapter = 6.32}}, mentions the actions.</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Eusebius | title = Vita Constantini | chapter = IV.6}}</ref><ref>{{citation | first = Charles Manson | last = Odahl | title = Constantine and the Christian Empire | chapter = X}}.</ref>

Both the [[Greuthungi]] and [[Thervingi]] became heavily Romanized during the 4th century. This came about through trade with the Byzantines, as well as through Gothic membership of a military covenant, which was based in Byzantium and involved pledges of military assistance. The Goths converted to [[Arianism]] during this time. [[Hun]]nic domination of the Gothic kingdom in Scythia began in the 370s according to [[Ammianus]].<ref name = "Marcellinus XXXI 2">"However, the seed and origin of all the ruin and various disasters that the wrath of Mars aroused<U+2026> we have found to be (the invasions of the Huns)", {{citation | first = Ammianus | last = Marcellinus | volume = XXXI | chapter = 2 | publisher = Loeb edition | coauthor = tr. John Rolfe | year = 1922}}.</ref> and confirmed by the [[Eunapius]] and the later [[Zosimus]]. Under pressure of the Huns, the chieftain [[Fritigern]] approached the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Valens]] in 376 with a portion of the Thervingi and asked to be allowed to settle with his people on the south bank of the Danube. Valens permitted this, and even assisted the Goths in their crossing of the river<ref>{{citation | first = Michael | last = Kulikowski | title = Rome<U+2019>s Gothic Wars | page = 130}}.</ref> (probably at the fortress of [[Durostorum]]). Following a famine, however, the [[Gothic War (376-382)|Gothic War of 376<U+2013>82]] ensued, and the Goths and the local Thracians rebelled. The Roman Emperor Valens was killed at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.

The Goths remained divided - as Visigoths and Ostrogoths - during the fifth century. These two tribes were among the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic peoples]] who clashed with the late [[Roman Empire]] during the [[Migration Period]]. A Visigothic force led by [[Alaric I]] [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked Rome in 410]]. [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] granted the Visigoths [[Aquitania]], where they defeated the [[Vandals]] and conquered most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by 475.

In the meantime, the Ostrogoths broke away from Hunnic rule following the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. At the request of emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], [[Theodoric the Great]] conquered all of Italy beginning in 488. The Goths were briefly reunited under one crown in the early sixth century under Theodoric the Great, who became regent of the Visigothic kingdom following the death of [[Alaric II]] at the [[Battle of Vouill<U+00E9>]] in 507. [[Procopius]] interpreted the name ''Visigoth'' as "western Goths" and the name ''Ostrogoth'' as "eastern Goth", reflecting the geographic distribution of the Gothic realms at that time.

The [[Ostrogothic kingdom]] persisted until 553 under [[Teia]], when Italy returned briefly to Byzantine control. This restoration of imperial rule was reversed by the conquest of the [[Lombards]] in 568. The Visigothic kingdom lasted until 711 under [[Roderic]], when it fell to the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Umayyad]] invasion of the Iberian Peninsula ([[Al-Andalus]]).

In the late 6th century Goths settled as ''[[foederati]]'' in parts of [[Asia Minor]]. Their descendants, who formed the elite ''[[Optimatoi]]'' regiment, still lived there in the early 8th century. While they were largely assimilated, their Gothic origin was still well-known: the chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] calls them ''Gothograeci''.

[[Isidore of Seville]], in his 6th century work ''Etymology'', recorded that ''[[Getae]]'' was the first name for the Goths, who lived in an area between the Danube and the Carpathians. They were considered "Dachians", referring to the province of [[Dacia]] (present-day [[Romania]]).

==Languages==
{{Main|Gothic language|Gothic alphabet}}

The [[Gothic language]] is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Germanic language]] that was spoken by the Goths. It is known primarily from the [[Codex Argenteus]], a 6th century copy of a 4th century Bible translation, and is the only [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic language]] with a sizable corpus. All others, including [[Burgundian language (Germanic)|Burgundian]] and [[Vandalic language|Vandalic]], are known, if at all, only from proper names that survived in historical accounts, and from loan-words in other languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]].

As a Germanic language, Gothic is a part of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family. It is the Germanic language with the earliest attestation but has no modern descendants. The oldest documents in Gothic date back to the 4th century. The language was in decline by the mid-6th century, due in part to the military defeat of the Goths at the hands of the [[Franks]], the elimination of the Goths in Italy, and geographic isolation (in Spain the Gothic language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589).<ref name=Pohl119-21>{{citation | title = Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300<U+2013>800 (Transformation of the Roman World | first = Walter | last = Pohl | isbn = 9004108467 | pages = 119<U+2013>21}}.</ref> The language survived as a domestic language in the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) as late as the 8th century, and [[Franks|Frankish]] author [[Walafrid Strabo]] wrote that it was still spoken in the lower [[Danube]] area and in isolated mountain regions in [[Crimea]] in the early 9th century (see [[Crimean Gothic language|Crimean Gothic]]). Gothic-seeming terms found in later (post-9th century) manuscripts may not belong to the same language.

The existence of such early attested corpora makes it a language of considerable interest in [[comparative linguistics]].

The [[Gutes]] (''Gotlanders'') themselves had oral traditions of a mass migration towards southern Europe, recorded in the [[Gutasaga]]. If the facts are related, this would be a unique case of a tradition that endured for more than a thousand years and that actually pre-dates most of the major splits in the Germanic language family.

The Goths' relationship with Sweden became an important part of Swedish nationalism, and until the 19th century the Swedes were commonly considered to be the direct descendants of the Goths. Today, Swedish scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].

Beginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by Gods Grace of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends King.}} In 1973, with the death of King Gustaf VI Adolf, the title was changed to simply "King of Sweden."

In Medieval and Modern Spain, the [[Visigoths]] were believed to be the origin of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles did service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).<ref name = "Pohl 124-6">{{citation | title = Strategies of Distinction: Construction of Ethnic Communities, 300<U+2013>800 (Transformation of the Roman World) | first = Walter | last = Pohl | id = ISBN 9004108467 | pages = 124<U+2013>6}}.</ref>

In Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be "''haci<U+00E9>ndose los godos''" ("making himself to act like the Goths"). Thus, in [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and the [[Canary Islands]], ''godo'' was an [[ethnic slur]] used against European Spaniards, who in the early colony period often felt superior to the people born locally (''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'').

The Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who was to have the finest chairs and who was to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of [[Diocese of V<U+00E4>xj<U+00F6>|V<U+00E4>xj<U+00F6>]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of [[V<U+00E4>sterg<U+00F6>tland]] (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of [[<U+00D6>sterg<U+00F6>tland]] (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the ''lazy'' and ''unenterprising'' Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the ''heroic'' Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.<ref>Ergo 12-1996.</ref><ref>[http://runeberg.org/samlaren/1896/0195.html S<U+00F6>derberg, Werner.
