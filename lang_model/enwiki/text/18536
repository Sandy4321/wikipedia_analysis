A '''laboratory''' ({{IPAc-en|l|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|b|<U+0252>r|<U+0259>|t|<U+0259>r|i}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|l|<U+00E6>|b|<U+0259>r|<U+0259>|t|r|i}}; informally, '''lab''') is a facility that  provides controlled conditions in which [[science|scientific]] or technological research, [[experiment]]s, and [[measurement]] may be performed.

Labs used for scientific research take many forms because of the differing requirements of specialists in the various fields of science. A [[physics]] lab might contain a [[particle accelerator]] or [[vacuum chamber]], while a [[metallurgy]] lab could have apparatus for [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]] or [[refining]] metals or for testing their [[strength of materials|strength]]. A [[chemistry|chemist]] or [[biology|biologist]] might use a [[wet laboratory]], while a [[psychology|psychologist's]] lab might be a room with one-way mirrors and hidden cameras in which to observe behavior. In some laboratories, such as those commonly used by [[computer scientist]]s, [[computer]]s (sometimes [[supercomputer]]s) are used for either [[computer simulation|simulations]] or the [[data analysis|analysis]] of [[data]] collected elsewhere. Scientists in other fields will use still other types of laboratories. [[Engineers]] use labs as well.

Despite the great differences among laboratories, some features are common. The use of [[workbench]]es or [[countertop]]s at which [[scientist]]s may choose to either sit or stand is a common way to ensure comfortable working conditions. [[Cabinet (furniture)|Cabinets]] for the storage of laboratory equipment are also found in laboratories. It is traditional for a scientist to record an experiment's progress in a [[laboratory notebook]], but modern labs almost always contain at least one computer workstation for data collection and analysis.

Scientific laboratories can be found in [[school]]s and [[university|universities]], in [[industry]], in [[government]] or [[military]] facilities, and even aboard [[ship]]s and [[spacecraft]]. A laboratory might offer work space for just one to more than thirty researchers depending on its size and purpose. Recently, a new type of laboratory called Open Laboratory has emerged.{{when|date=September 2013}} Its format allows the sharing of space, equipment, support staff between different research groups and also fosters information exchange through communications across fields.

==Laboratory techniques==
Laboratory techniques are the sum of procedures used on [[natural sciences]] such as [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[physics]] in order to conduct an experiment, all of them follow [[scientific method]]; while some of them involves the use of complex laboratory equipment from [[laboratory glassware]] to electrical devices others require such specific or expensive supplies.

==Laboratory equipment==

Laboratory equipment refers to the various tools and equipment used by scientists working in a laboratory.  These include tools such as [[Bunsen burner]]s, and [[microscope]]s as well as specialty equipment such as  [[operant conditioning chamber]]s, [[spectrophotometer]]s and [[calorimeter]]s. Another important type of laboratory equipment is [[laboratory glassware]] such as the [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]] or [[reagent bottle]], or even a [[thermometer]].

Laboratory equipment is generally used to either perform an [[experiment]] or to take [[measurement]]s and gather [[data]]. Larger or more sophisticated equipment is generally called a [[scientific instrument]].

==Specialised types of laboratory==
The title of ''laboratory'' is also used for certain other facilities where the processes or equipment used are similar to those in scientific laboratories. These notably include:
* [[film laboratory]] or [[darkroom]]
* [[Clandestine chemistry|clandestine lab]] for the production of [[illegal drug]]s
* [[computer lab]]
* [[crime lab]] used to process [[crime scene]] evidence
* [[media lab]]
* [[medical laboratory|medical lab]] (involves handling of chemical compounds)
* [[public health laboratory|public health lab]]
In recent years government and private centers for innovation in learning, leadership and organization have adopted "lab" in their name to emphasize the experimental and research-oriented nature of their work.

==Laboratory safety==
[[Image:2008-07-02 Eye wash station.jpg|thumb|An [[eyewash]] station in a laboratory.]]
In some laboratories, the conditions are no more dangerous than in any other room. In many labs, though, hazards are present. Laboratory hazards are as varied as the subjects of study in laboratories, and might include [[poison]]s; [[infectious agent]]s; [[flammable]], [[explosive]], or [[radioactive]] materials; moving [[machinery]]; extreme [[temperatures]]; [[laser]]s, strong [[magnetic field]]s or [[high voltage]]. In laboratories where dangerous conditions might exist, [[safety]] precautions are important. Rules exist to minimize the individual's risk, and [[safety equipment]] is used to protect the lab user from injury or to assist in responding to an [[emergency]].

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, recognizing the unique characteristics of the laboratory workplace, has tailored a standard for occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories. This standard is often referred to as the "Laboratory Standard". Under this standard, a laboratory is required to produce a Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) which addresses the specific hazards found in its location, and its approach to them.

In determining the proper Chemical Hygiene Plan for a particular business or laboratory, it is necessary to understand the requirements of the standard, evaluation of the current safety, health and environmental practices and assessment of the hazards. The CHP must be reviewed annually. Many schools and businesses employ safety, health, and environmental specialists, such as a Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) to develop, manage, and evaluate their CHP. Additionally, third party review is also used to provide an objective "outside view" which provides a fresh look at areas and problems that may be taken for granted or overlooked due to habit.

Inspections and audits like  also be conducted on a regular basis to assess hazards due to chemical handling and storage, electrical equipment, biohazards, hazardous waste management, housekeeping and emergency preparedness, radiation safety, ventilation as well as respiratory testing and indoor air quality. An important element of such audits is the review of regulatory compliance and the training of individuals who have access to and/or work in the laboratory. Training is critical to the ongoing safe operation of the laboratory facility. Educators, staff and management must be engaged in working to reduce the likelihood of accidents, injuries and potential litigation. Efforts are made to ensure laboratory safety videos are both relevant and engaging.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michael L. Matson, Jeffrey P.
