'''Constance Stokes''' (born '''Constance Parkin''', 1906<U+2013>1991) was an Australian painter. Described as "a leading figure in the modernist movement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]", she painted few works in the 1930s, but had paintings and drawings exhibited from the 1940s onwards. She was one of only two women, and two Victorians, included in a major exhibition of twelve Australian artists that travelled to Canada, the United Kingdom and Venice in the early 1950s.

Influenced by [[George Bell (painter)|George Bell]], Stokes was part of the Melbourne Contemporary Artists, a group he established in 1940. In contrast to many of her modernist colleagues, her works continued to be well-regarded by critics for many years after the group's formation. Her husband's early death in 1962 forced her to return to painting as a career, resulting in a successful one-woman show in 1964, her first in thirty years. She continued to paint and exhibit through the 1970s and 1980s, and was the subject of a retrospective exhibition that toured Victorian regional galleries including [[Swan Hill Regional Gallery]] and [[Geelong Art Gallery]] in 1985. She died in 1991 and is little-known in comparison to some other women artists including [[Grace Cossington Smith]] and [[Clarice Beckett]], but her fortunes were revived somewhat as a central figure in [[Anne Summers]] 2009 book ''The Lost Mother''. Her art is represented in most major Australian galleries, including the [[Australian National Gallery]] and the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]; the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] is the only significant national collection not to hold one of her works.

==Life and training==
[[File:Burlington House.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Academy at [[Burlington House]], where Stokes studied in the 1930s, and in the galleries of which her works were exhibited in 1953.]]Constance Parkin was born in 1906 in the tiny hamlet of Miram, near [[Nhill]] in western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}} The family moved to [[Melbourne]] in 1920, and she completed her schooling at [[Genazzano FCJ College|Genazzano convent]] in the suburb of [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]].{{sfn|Summers|November 2009|p=4}} She was short (just under 5 feet tall) and had dark hair.{{sfn|Summers|2009|p=65}} She trained at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]] in Melbourne from 1925 to 1929. Over the summer of 1925<U+2013>1926, the Gallery held a competition for its students, who were asked to paint "holiday subjects"; Parkin won the prize for a landscape. The competition was judged by artist [[George Bell (painter)|George Bell]], who would have an ongoing influence on her artistic career.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3742021 |title=Items of interest |newspaper=[[The_Argus_(Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 <U+2013> 1956)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=26 March 1926 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At the end of her studies, she won the school's prestigious National Gallery Travelling Scholarship, which allowed her to continuing her training at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London.<ref name="DAAOStokes">{{cite web|url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/constance-stokes/|title=Constance Stokes b. 1906|work=Design & Art Australia Online|publisher=University of Sydney and University of NSW|accessdate=27 September 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.daao.org.au%2Fbio%2Fconstance-stokes%2F&date=2012-10-11|archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Summers|November 2009|p=4}} In addition to her studies at the Royal Academy, she studied under French [[cubism|cubist]] painter and sculptor [[Andr<U+00E9> Lhote]] in Paris in 1932.{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}} The following year she returned to Australia, where she married businessman Eric Stokes. The family settled initially in [[Collins Street, Melbourne]], and Stokes had three children born in the period 1937 to 1942.{{sfn|Summers|November 2009|p=5}} In later years, Stokes had a studio in the family home in [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], a modernist dwelling designed by architect Edward Billson.{{sfn|Summers|2009|p=89}}

Stokes had returned from honeymoon in 1934, but she produced few works in the years immediately following. Despite the Collins Street apartment becoming a full-time studio for Stokes, only two paintings and two sketches from the period are known. The most notable is ''The Village'' (c.1933<U+2013>1935), influenced, according to Stokes' own account, by the [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]] and portraitist [[Augustus John]]. This work was hung in the inaugural exhibition of the Contemporary Art Society, held at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]. It was included in a travelling exhibition that appeared in New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1941 and later in Canada.{{sfn|Summers|2009|p=56}} Years later, the work was acquired by the National Gallery of Victoria.

In the mid-twentieth century, there were divisions in the Melbourne art scene, which became intertwined with the complex cultural politics of the [[cold war]] era. In the late 1940s, there was a move against modernism in art, and [[tonalism]] came into favour. Partly as a reaction to this development, artist George Bell established an exhibiting group called the Melbourne Contemporary Artists in 1940. Bell was a former war artist and influential member of the Victorian artistic establishment, who after [[World War II]] was appointed to teach at the National Gallery of Victoria's painting school.{{sfn|Heathcote|1995|p=10}} Influenced by Bell,<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Fred|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra|volume=7|chapter=Bell, George Frederick Henry (1878<U+2013>1966)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bell-george-frederick-henry-5192/text8731|accessdate=27 September 2012}}</ref> Stokes was amongst the artists for whom modernism was a strong influence, and who exhibited with the Melbourne Contemporary Artists.{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}} Other members of the group included [[Russell Drysdale]] and [[Sali Herman]].{{sfn|Heathcote|1995|p=16}}

Stokes' artistry endured in a way that that of some of her modernist colleagues did not. By 1945, when the Melbourne Contemporary Artists held one of their exhibitions, art critic Alan McCulloch observed that the works were becoming "technical and often imitative" and that the former standards of the group were being maintained by only a few members. One of those was Stokes, whose work ''The Family'' he praised as "strongly designed and sensitively modelled".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12149284 |title=Contemporary artists' show |newspaper=[[The_Argus_(Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 <U+2013> 1956)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=26 October 1945 |accessdate=9 October 2012 |page=20 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The following year, though, McCulloch was more upbeat, describing the quality of their show as the "highest they have yet achieved", while again complementing Stokes on her "rich and opulent pictures".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22395222 |title=Art exhibitions |newspaper=[[The_Argus_(Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 <U+2013> 1956)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=30 October 1946 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Six years later, when the group exhibited in 1952, the critic for Melbourne's ''[[The Argus (Australia)|Argus]]'' was as unimpressed with the group as a whole as had been McCulloch in 1945. Suggesting that the show demonstrated that "modern art in Melbourne needs some new ideas", he nevertheless singled out a small number of works for praise. Amongst these was Stokes' ''Christ with Simon and Andrew'', which he thought showed "richness and feeling".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article23212947 |title=Art needs new ideas|newspaper=[[The_Argus_(Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 <U+2013> 1956)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=14 October 1952 |accessdate=30 September 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> 

At the same time as she was being praised at home in Victoria, the portrait ''Girl Drying Her Hair'' was one of six paintings owned by that state's gallery that was being loaned for an exhibition on the other side of the country in [[Perth]]. The city's newspaper, ''[[The West Australian]]'', chose Stokes' picture to illustrate its story on the exhibition, and described the work as "notable for its patient handling, use of bright colour and skilful blending of figure and background".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49057932 |title=Loan Pictures. |newspaper=[[Perth_Gazette|The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=13 October 1952 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The National Gallery of Victoria does not hold a painting by that title, but has ''Woman Drying Her Hair'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/3027|title=Woman Drying Her Hair|last=Stokes|first=Constance|date=c.1946|work=Collection search|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> probably the same work, which the gallery had acquired in 1947 at the behest of curator and artist [[Daryl Lindsay]].{{sfn|Summers|2009|p=138}} It was about to travel a great deal further than to just Perth.

In 1953, at the request of Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] and the [[British Arts Council]], an exhibition of the works of twelve Australian artists was assembled. It was shown in five British cities
as well as at the [[Venice Biennale]]. Of the twelve artists selected for inclusion, only two were from Victoria (the rest were from New South Wales); one of these two was Stokes. Her three works, including ''Woman Drying Her Hair'',{{sfn|Summers|2009|p=138}} hung alongside those of Australia's most prominent mid-twentieth century artists, including [[Arthur Boyd]], Russell Drysdale, [[William Dobell]], [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Lloyd Rees]], [[Donald Friend]] and [[Frank Hinder]].<ref name=abroad>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18378019 |title=Australian art display abroad |newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=11 April 1953 |accessdate=8 October 2012 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Despite these prominent painters being selected for inclusion, when the exhibition appeared in London, Stokes' painting ''[[Girl in Red Tights]]'' drew critical attention and acclaim. Admired by director of the [[National Gallery]] Sir [[Philip Hendy]], the work was proclaimed by the art critic at ''[[The Times]]'' as the "best picture in London that week".{{sfn|Summers|November 2009|p=2}} Some artists in Sydney were not so impressed. A meeting of the Royal Art Society of New South Wales urged Prime Minister Menzies to intervene, with members describing the paintings as "the worst ever gathered in one place".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18372484 |title=Outcry Over Art For London|newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=21 April 1953 |accessdate=30 September 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> However, the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board member who announced the exhibition had considered that it would be for Australian art "its biggest boost in history".<ref name=abroad/> The following year, Joseph Burke, Professor of Fine Arts at the [[University of Melbourne]], praised Stokes' painting, making particular reference to her work that had so entranced viewers at the 1953 exhibition. "Constance Stokes", he wrote, was a painter who "announced the pursuit of the classical ideal as [her] aim. [Her] ''Girl in Red Tights,'' with its Venetian richness of colouring, ably sustains the monumental harmony of the classical tradition."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18407780 |title=Art In Australia |newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=4 February 1954 |accessdate=30 September 2012 |page=10 Supplement: Royal Tour Supplement |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

Religious subjects appear regularly in the paintings of Constance Stokes, with one, ''The Baptism'', being in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. Despite her recurring attention to such subjects, however, the artist entered the [[Blake Prize for Religious Art]] only once, in 1953. Esmond George, critic at [[Adelaide]] newspaper ''The Mail'', admired the (unidentified) work as having "strong art interest".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57777282 |title=The week in art |last=George|first=Esmond|newspaper=[[Sunday_Mail_(Adelaide)|The Mail (Adelaide, SA : 1912 <U+2013> 1954)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=23 May 1953 |accessdate=19 November 2012 |page=16 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Stokes' interest in the Prize was not so strong as to prompt her to enter again. She told an interviewer that "abstract painting took over".{{sfn|Summers|2009|pp=170<U+2013>171}}

Eric Stokes died unexpectedly in 1962, an experience which left Constance Stokes bereft; a long-time friend said that she "never got over her husband's death".{{sfn|Summers|2009|pp=171<U+2013>173}} However, faced with a substantial mortgage to service, Stokes returned to work: painting. Two years later, she opened her first one-woman show in over thirty years. It comprised 43 works, with the 27 paintings priced dearly, at upwards of 150 [[guineas]]. The exhibition was a success, both financially (Stokes earned over 4000 guineas) and critically (the exhibition attracted praise from art historian and critic [[Bernard William Smith]]).{{sfn|Summers|2009|pp=174<U+2013>175}} Throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she painted and held shows, with her works being well-received.{{sfn|Summers|2009|p=164}} They were included in the 1975 exhibition ''Australian women artists'' at the [[University of Melbourne]], and the Regional Galleries Association of Victoria's 1977 touring exhibition ''The heroic years of Australian painting, 1940<U+2013>1965''.{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}} Stokes' last painting was ''Alice Tumbling Down the Rabbit Hole'', painted around 1989; the artist died in 1991.{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}}

==Legacy==
The standard reference work, ''McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art'', describes Stokes as "a leading figure in the modernist movement in Victoria".{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}} Not all critics regard Stokes' work so favourably, however. Art historian Christopher Heathcote acknowledges the recognition of Stokes' work by her contemporaries, but turns this into a criticism, saying that "strong staff support [at Melbourne University] for a few lesser practitioners, such as Constance Stokes... hardly aided the appreciation of the better local work."{{sfn|Heathcote|1995|p=180}} And while she appears in McCulloch's guide, few other reviews of Australian art recognise Stokes. Exceptions, according to feminist writer [[Anne Summers]], include [[Ursula Hoff]]'s ''Masterpieces of the National Gallery of Victoria'' and [[Janine Burke]]'s ''Australian Women Artists. One Hundred Years 1840<U+2013>1940'', both of which refer to the well-travelled painting ''Woman Drying Her Hair''.{{sfn|Summers|2009|pp=154<U+2013>155}} While academic artists and art historians such as Bernard William Smith and Joseph Burke praised Stokes' work during her lifetime, she faded into relative obscurity. There is, however, a strong secondary market for her works.{{sfn|Summers|2009|p=177}} Stokes returned to some prominence through a book by Anne Summers, published in 2009, called ''The Lost Mother'', in which Stokes and her paintings are central to a narrative about Summers' own family.{{sfn|Summers|2009}} Summers contrasts Stokes' ongoing obscurity with the dramatic resurrection of the oevre of artists [[Grace Cossington Smith]] and [[Clarice Beckett]], both brought to attention by well-regarded gallery curators. Summers considers a number of factors to be involved in Stokes' fate, including the lack of a high-profile champion of her work, her association with George Bell, and her Melbournian identity in a time when "Sydney was where the ideas and the experimentation were and the place where reputations were made".{{sfn|Summers|2009|pp=161<U+2013>162}}

A retrospective exhibition of Stokes' paintings toured Victorian regional galleries including [[Swan Hill Regional Gallery]] and [[Geelong Art Gallery]] in 1985. The next year, an exhibition of her work toured several state galleries and the S.H. Irvin gallery in Sydney. In 1992, her works were amongst those displayed in the National Gallery of Victoria's exhibition ''Classical Modernism: The George Bell Circle'', while in 1993 the same gallery curated an exhibition of her paintings and drawings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/204840|title=Constance Stokes : retrospective exhibition|date=1985|work=NLA Catalogue entry|publisher=Swan Hill Regional Art Gallery, Pioneer Settlement Authority|accessdate=27 September 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}} 

Most major Australian collections hold works by Stokes: ''The Village'' is one of thirteen in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].  Closely associated with Victoria, and in particular the cultural millieu of Melbourne, Stokes is well represented in the galleries of that state. These include the [[Ballarat Fine Art Gallery]], [[Benalla Art Gallery]], Geelong Art Gallery, [[Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery]], and Swan Hill Regional Gallery. Other public galleries holding works by Stokes include the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], the [[Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory]], and the [[Queensland Art Gallery]]. The [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] is alone amongst the major collections in not holding any of her paintings or drawings.{{sfn|McCulloch|2006|p=911}}<ref name=NGVillage>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/col/work/3026|title=The village|last=Stokes|first=Constance|work=Collection online|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|accessdate=27 September 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ngv.vic.gov.au%2Fcol%2Fwork%2F3026&date=2012-10-11 |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Summers|2009|pp=43<U+2013>44}}
