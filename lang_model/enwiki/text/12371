An addiction can be defined as a state of being enslaved by a habit that is psychologically habit-forming.  In this case, the psychologically habit-forming item is a video game called [[World of Warcraft]], created by Blizzard Entertainment.  According the Blizzard<U+2019>s site devoted to the game:
<blockquote>

World of Warcraft is an online role-playing experience set in the award-winning Warcraft universe. Players assume the roles of Warcraft heroes as they explore, adventure, and quest across a vast world. World of Warcraft is a "Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game" which allows thousands of players to interact within the same world. Whether adventuring together or fighting against each other in epic battles, players will form friendships, forge alliances, and compete with enemies for power and glory</blockquote>
There are millions of people that play World of Warcraft (often abbreviated as WoW), and many of them play for a large amount of time, thus being considered <U+201C>addicted.<U+201D>

== Statistics of the addiction ==

There are 11 million players in the World of Warcraft.  It is a common misconception that this video game appeals mainly to teenagers of the male gender.  On the contrary, this game attracts many audiences of different ages and genders.
*Only '''25%''' of MMORPG players are teenagers.
*According to demographic surveys of World of Warcraft show that the average age of a player is '''28'''.
*'''84%''' of World of Warcraft players are male.
*'''16%''' are female.

	The average World of Warcraft player is online for 2-3 hours a day, but some have been reported to play for up to 12 hours a day.  A 12 hour playing day is an explanation for the statistic that only 50% of World of Warcraft players hold full-time jobs.

== Examples of addiction ==
There are thousands of stories online and many in the news that talk about people who are addicted to World of Warcraft.  As is inferred by the statistics above, anybody and everybody is prone to an addiction.  Often, ex-WoWers will tell their stories, much like this man:
<blockquote>60 levels, 30+ epics, a few really good "real life" friends, a seat on the oldest and largest guild on our server's council, 70+ days "played," and one "real" year later...

I just left WoW permanently. I was a leader in one of the largest and most respected guilds in the world, a well-equipped and well-versed mage, and considered myself to have many close friends in my guild. Why did I leave? Simple: Blizzard has created an alternate universe where we don't have to be ourselves when we don't want to be. From my vantage point as a guild decision maker, I've seen it destroy more families and friendships and take a huge toll on individuals than any drug on the market today, and that means a lot coming from an ex-club DJ.

It took a huge personal toll on me. To illustrate the impact it had, let's look at me one year later. When I started playing, I was working towards getting into the best shape of my life (and making good progress, too). Now a year later, I'm about 30 pounds heavier that I was back then, and it is not muscle. I had a lot of hobbies including DJing (which I was pretty accomplished at) and music as well as writing and martial arts.

I haven't touched a record or my guitar for over a year and I think if I tried any Kung Fu my gut would throw my back out. Finally, and most significantly, I had a very satisfying social life before. My friends and I would go out and there were things to do every night of the week. Now a year later, I realize my true friends are the greatest people in the world because the fact I came out of my room, turned the lights on, and watched a movie with them still means something. They still are having a great time teasing me at my expense, however, which shows they still love me and they haven't changed.

== Studies ==
	In an 8-year study done by Nick Yee, a scholar from Stanford University, he attempts to explain the reasons for an addiction.  In an article he wrote, Yee stated that there are five motivational factors for the average MMORPG player: Achievement, Relationship, Immersion, Escapism and Manipulation.

	Male players were more likely to be driven by the Achievement and Manipulation factors, while female players were more likely to be driven to addiction by the Relationship factor. As quoted about relationships and a deeper sense of the game:
<blockquote>MMORPGs are not simply a pastime for teenagers, but a valuable research venue and platform where millions of users interact and collaborate using real-time 3D avatars on a daily basis.</blockquote>

== Motivational factors at work ==

In regards to the Achievement factor, MMORPGs reward players in more ways than just combat.  In World of Warcraft, there are fourteen different types of professions you can take up as a virtual character, ranging from Mining to Tailoring to Engineering.  A player develops economic skills using a virtual E-bay, called an Auction House, and a sense of achievement is earned when a players does the work required in leveling a profession to its highest level.

As far as combat roles are concerned, each <U+201C>class<U+201D> or race has its strengths/weaknesses which often need to be coordinated perfectly in order to take down certain bosses or enemies.  A sense of achievement is obtained when a group or <U+201C>party<U+201D> of people is able to coordinate combat roles correctly in order to do something otherwise impossible alone.

A typical situation is described by Yee in a section about Collaboration:
<blockquote>
In the span of 5 to 10 seconds, the risk-analysis, opinions and decisions of the group communicated over typed chat, or the solitary actions of a particular user, will determine the life or death of all members of the group. This particular type of crisis is also embedded into the larger context of existing tensions such as emergent leadership, group polarization, and personality differences.
</blockquote>
	
In addition, an Achievement System has been added to the World of Warcraft.  Achievements range anywhere from acquiring a pet to defeating bosses that require 25 people to take down.  When one gets an achievement, a congratulatory banner flashes across his or her screen and the achievement is announced to most of the player<U+2019>s friends.

Relationships are also developed through the constant communication and online interaction that is prevalent in MMORPGs.  As was exemplified above, collaboration is required in order to fully realize the potential of the games that are designed to make people rely on other people in a virtual world.

Escapism- People play World of Warcraft as a way to escape the outside world.  As stated by an addicted teenager: 
<U+201C>For a while, I had family problems, and WoW was a shelter. It was my anti-depressant. I<U+2019>ve been playing WoW since the release, and I<U+2019>ve been playing with the same group of friends for that amount of time.<U+201D>

	The virtual world one can find oneself in when playing World of Warcraft is vast, immersive, and proven to be extremely addictive.  The five aforementioned factors as well as many other emotional and physical appeals are huge aspects of the game, which manages to be beneficial (Gaining knowledge about the economy through the Auction House), and detrimental (Neglect of real life responsibilities).  Whether or not a person is addicted is decided only by his or her self, and the consequences of such apply to the same rules.  <br>
