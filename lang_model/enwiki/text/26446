'''Gustavus''' (1818 &ndash; after 1836) was a [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse that won the 1821 [[Epsom Derby]]. Gustavus was the first [[Gray (horse)|grey]] horse to win the Epsom Derby. He raced until he was four-years-old and was retired to stud in 1823 and was exported to Prussia in 1836. Gustavus was not a successful sire.

==Background==
Gustavus was foaled in 1818 at the Hampton Court Stud. Gustavus was bred by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] and was sired by the 1807 Derby winner [[Election (horse)|Election]]. Election was a successful racehorse that was bred by the [[George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont|Earl of Egremont]] and was bought by the Prince of Wales after his racing career to stand at Hampton Court. His dam, Lady Grey, was bred by Colonel Childers at Cantley House in [[Yorkshire]]<ref name="sporting gray">{{cite journal|last=Staff|title=Sporting Intelligence|journal=Sporting Magazine|year=1822|volume=8|page=144|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066599394?urlappend=%3Bseq=172}}</ref> and was one of the Prince's famous "half-dozen grey mares" that were housed at Hampton-Court.<ref name="lady grey">{{cite journal|last=Staff|title=Some breeding stud reminiscences|journal=Baily's magazine of sports and pastimes|year=1899|month=April|volume=71|page=274|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u54bAQAAIAAJ&dq=gustavus%20%20%22lady%20grey%22%20stud&pg=PA274#v=onepage&q=gustavus%20%20%22lady%20grey%22%20stud&f=false}}</ref> Lady Grey's sire, Stamford, was a full-brother to the Epsom Derby winners [[Paris (horse)|Paris]] and [[Archduke (horse)|Archduke]].

In addition to breeding racehorses, the Prince also bred grey Thoroughbreds that would be "sufficiently powerful for his own riding,"<ref name=youatt>{{cite book|last=Youatt|first=William and Cornelius Tongue|title=The horse|year=1860|publisher=Routledge, Warne, & Routledge|location=London|page=31|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=V7ACAAAAYAAJ&dq=gustavus%20germany%20derby%20stallions&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q=gustavus%20germany%20derby%20stallions&f=false}}</ref> with Lady Grey purchased specifically for this purpose.<ref name="lady grey" /> Gustavus was a small yearling and the Prince did not think he would be a suitable riding horse.<ref name=youatt /> Gustavus was sold to Mr. Hunter<ref>{{cite journal|last=Staff|title=Sporting intelligence|journal=Sporting Magazine|year=1821|volume=8|page=143|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066599394?urlappend=%3Bseq=171}}</ref> for 25 guineas as a yearling.

==Racing Career==
Gustavus was trained at Six-Mile Bottom in Newmarket by Crouch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Black|first=Robert|title=Horse-racing in England: a synoptical review|year=1893|publisher=Richard Bently and Son|location=London|page=249|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ypIXAAAAYAAJ&dq=gustavus%20crouch%20trainer&pg=PA249#v=onepage&q=gustavus%20crouch%20trainer&f=false}}</ref> Gustavus first raced as a two-year-old for the July Stakes. The Derby was his most significant win and he raced until he was four years-old, winning seven races in 14 starts. He was retired to stud in 1823.

===1820: two-year-old season===
Gustavus's first career start occurred on 10 July at the July Meeting in Newmarket for the July Stakes. Gustavus won the race by half a [[Horse length|length]] from an unnamed colt by Soothsayer and seven other horses, winning 1,950 guineas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Staff|title=The racing calendar|journal=The Sporting Magazine|year=1820|volume=6|page=47|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066599402?urlappend=%3Bseq=381}}</ref> The run for the July Stakes was Gustavus' only start as a two-year-old.

At the First Spring Meeting at Newmarket in May, Gustavus won the Newmarket Stakes, beating the colts Tressilian and Fleur de Lis.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weatherby|first=James and Edward|title=Newmarket|journal=Racing Calendar|year=1821|volume=49|page=26|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066591227?urlappend=%3Bseq=80}}</ref> 

In his second start of the season, Gustavus ran in the [[Epsom Derby|Derby Stakes]] at Epsom against a field of twelve other horses. Gustavus was the betting favorite for the running, starting the race with 2 to 1<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weatherby|first=James and Edward|title=Epsom|journal=Racing Calendar|year=1821|volume=49|page=42|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066591227?urlappend=%3Bseq=96}}</ref> or 7.5 to 4 odds depending on the [[bookmaking]] operation. The [[George FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]]'s colt Reginald (the winner of the [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]]) initially took the lead and "made the running" with Gustavus initiating "some play" with Reginald at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Tattenham Corner]]<ref name="sport derby" /> and the two horses "worked together from end to end in the Derby, as if it was run a match."<ref name=dixon>{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Henry Hall|title=Scott and Sebright|year=1914|publisher=Frederick Warne and Co.|location=London|page=16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=65zImlRcgaEC&lpg=PA16&ots=R2-b2bcoec&dq=%22shabby%20little%20grey%22%20gustavus&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q=%22shabby%20little%20grey%22%20gustavus&f=false}}</ref> Gustavus was ridden by Sam Day and Reginald's jockey was [[Francis Buckle]].
