[[Image:CivilizationAmigaAGA.png|right|thumb|''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' popularized the detailed empire management that has become a staple of 4X [[Strategy video game|strategy games]].]]

'''4X''' games are a [[video game genre|genre]] of [[strategy video game|strategy]] [[video game]] where players control an [[empire]] and '''"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate."''' This term was first used by [[Alan Emrich]] in his September 1993 preview of ''[[Master of Orion]]'' for ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''. Since 1993, other game commentators have adopted "4X" to describe any game with similar [[game design|design]].

4X games are noted for their deep, complex [[gameplay]]. These games emphasize economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. Managing the details of a large empire can cause 4X games to take longer to complete than other strategy games. Since the amount of [[micromanagement (computer gaming)|micromanagement]] required to sustain an empire scales as the empire grows, 4X games are sometimes criticized for becoming tedious near the end of the game. As a result, several games have attempted to address these criticisms by reducing micromanagement.

The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from [[board game]]s and 1970s [[Text-based (computing)| text-based]] computer games. The first 4X games were [[turn-based]], but [[real-time strategy|real-time]] 4X games have been released. Many 4X games were published in the mid-1990s, but they were outsold by other strategy games by the late 1990s. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have been critically and commercially successful. One well-known 4X game is [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' from 1990, which popularized the level of detail that has become a staple of the genre.

The term "4X" originates from a 1993 preview of ''[[Master of Orion]]'' in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' by [[Alan Emrich]], in which he rated the game "XXXX" as a pun on the XXX rating for pornography. The four Xs were an abbreviation for ''explore, expand, exploit, exterminate''.<ref name="Emrich1993">{{cite news | author = Alan Emrich | title = MicroProse' Strategic Space Opera is Rated XXXX| work = Computer Gaming World (Issue #110) | date = 1993-09 | page = 92<U+2013>93 | accessdate = 2008-05-21 }}</ref> Other game commentators eventually adopted the "4X" label to describe a game genre with specific [[gameplay]] conventions:<ref name="4Xfulldefinition">For sources that go into detail about each of the four Xs, see: {{ cite web | url=http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/818084/page_2.html | title=Civilization IV: Warlords Guide | publisher = IGN | author= J.

*''Explore'' means players send scouts across a [[mini-map|map]] to reveal surrounding territories.
*''Expand'' means players claim new territory by creating new settlements, or sometimes by extending the influence of existing settlements.
*''Exploit'' means players gather and use resources in areas they control, and improve the efficiency of that usage.
*''Exterminate'' means attacking and eliminating rival players. Since all territory is eventually claimed, eliminating a rival's presence can be the only way to achieve further expansion.

These four elements of gameplay have been described as phases which often overlap.<ref name="MOO2Retro"/> These phases can vary in length depending on the [[game design]]. For example, ''[[Space Empires III]]'' and ''[[Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar]]'' have a long expansion phase, because players must make large investments in research to explore and expand into every area.<ref>i. {{cite web | url = http://www.malfador.com/se3.html | publisher = Malfador | title = ''Space Empires III'' Manual v1.10 | date = 1998-01-21 | accessdate = 2008-06-24 }}<br/>ii. {{ cite web | url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/763/763792p1.html | author = Steve Butts | title= Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar Review | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-02-12 | accessdate=2008-07-26 }}<br />iii. {{ cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/galacticcivilizations2darkavatar/review.html | author=Jeff Lackey | publisher = GameSpot |title= Review - Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar | date = 2007-02-28 | accessdate=2008-07-26 }}</ref>

===Difficulties in definition===
Many strategy games arguably contain a similar "explore, expand, exploit, exterminate" cycle. But game journalists, [[Video game developer|developers]] and enthusiasts generally apply "4X" to a more specific class of games,<ref name="SOSEdistinct">{{cite web | url= http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157333 | publisher = 1UP.com | title= Sins of a Solar Empire Preview | author = Sean Molloy | accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref> and contrast 4X games with other strategy games such as ''[[Command & Conquer]]''.<ref name="MobyGames4xDef"/><ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/sinsofasolarempire/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews | title = Sins of a Solar Empire for PC Review - GameSpot | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2008-02-13 | author = Jason Ocampo | accessdate = 2008-07-31}}</ref> Hence, writers have tried to show how 4X games are defined by more than just having each of the four Xs.

===Fifth X: eXperience===
{{See also|Master of Orion III}}

In 2002, the pending release of ''Master of Orion III'' sparked claims that it would be the first "5X game". [[Alan Emrich]] announced that the fifth X would be the ''e'''X'''perience'' of delegating the ruler's authority to subordinates and sharing control over the empire.<ref name="MOO3DevChat">{{cite web | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/interviews/february02/moo3/ | author = Dan Quick | publisher= GameSpy | title=Master of Orion III Developer Chat | date = 2002-02 | accessdate = 2008-06-23 }}</ref> This experience would require players to make judicious use of "Imperial Focus" each turn, and determine which details of their empire are pressing enough to require their direct intervention.<ref name="imperialfocus">{{cite press release | url = http://moo3.quicksilver.com/press/0511a.html | publisher = Quicksilver Software | date=2000-05-11 | accessdate=2008-07-26 | title = MicroProse's MASTER OF ORION III Takes Galactic Empire Building a Step Higher}}</ref> ''Master of Orion III'' received mixed comments from reviewers and players. Although a few reviewers liked the experience of delegating power to [[bureaucrat]]s, the majority of reviewers found these limits on empire management frustrating or boring.<ref name="MetacriticMOO3" />

This new "experience" also included the threat of [[Civil disorder|unrest and revolt]] if players did not meet the demands of their citizens.<ref name="MOO3DevChat" /> However, unrest and revolt had already been seen in the 4X genre. ''[[Civilization II]]'' included the possibilities of civil unrest in unhappy cities and of being over-ruled by the [[senate]].<ref name="Civ2manual"/> In ''[[Galactic Civilizations]]'', the player's [[political party|party]] can even be voted out of office.<ref name="InternalPoliticalConstraints" />

=== Research and technology ===
[[Image:FreeOrion-tech-tree.png| thumb|right |One part of ''[[FreeOrion]]''<U+2019>s technology tree. Note the multiple branching paths between technologies.]]

4X games typically feature a [[technology tree]], which is a series of advancements that players can research to unlock new units, buildings, and other capabilities. Technology trees in 4X games are typically larger than in other strategy games, and feature more choices.<ref name="SOSEdistinct"/><ref name="JoystiqSoaSEDesignerInterview">{{ cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/02/01/joystiq-interview-ironclad-talks-4x-strategy-with-sins-of-a-sol/ | title=Joystiq interview: Ironclad talks 4X strategy with Sins of a Solar Empire | author = Jason Dobson | date= 2008-02-01 | publisher = Joystiq | accessdate=2008-06-23 }}</ref> Empires must generate research resources and invest them in new technology.<ref name="Rollings">{{cite book|author=Andrew Rollings|coauthors=Ernest Adams|title=Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design|publisher=New Riders Publishing|date=2003|pages=321<U+2013>345|url=http://safari.adobepress.com/1592730019/ch10 | isbn=1592730019}}

Research is important in 4X games because technological progress is an engine for conquest.<ref name="earlygameconventions"/> Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part.<ref name="IGNSE4"/> In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically-basic units remain important throughout the game.<ref name="Non4XBasicUnitsRemainImportant">{{cite web | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/starcraft/review.html | date = 1998-04-15 | publisher = GameSpot | author = Ron Dulin | title=StarCraft for PC Review | accessdate=2008-06-23 }}</ref>

===Combat===
Combat is an important part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game's universe.<ref name="gamespotSEV"/> Some 4X games, such as ''Galactic Civilizations'', resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet.<ref name="victory comparison"/> This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as ''[[Master of Orion]]'', that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen.<ref name="victory comparison"/><ref name="colonyscreen"/> Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by [[Spam (video gaming term)#Unit_spamming|superior numbers]] and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part.<ref name="IGNSE4">i. {{cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/reviews/march03/galacticcivpc/index.shtml | publisher = GameSpy | title = GameSpy Review - Galactic Civilizations | author = Allen "Delsyn" Rausch | date = 2003-03-28 | accessdate = 2008-07-30 }} <br/> ii. {{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/749/749070p2.html | publisher = IGN | title = IGN - Space Empires V Review | author = Steve Butts | date = 2006-12-04 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}</ref> 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting more emphasis on research and economics.<ref name="SOSA1upinterview"/><ref name="Emrich1993"/> Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry.<ref name="victory comparison"/>

=== Peaceful competition ===
[[Image:Sins of a Solar Empire - Diplomacy.jpg|thumb|right|In 4X games, such as the pictured ''[[Sins of a Solar Empire]]'', competing players may negotiate treaties with each other.]]
4X games allow rival players to engage in diplomacy.<ref name="diplobundle" /> While some strategy games offer shared victory and [[Cooperative gameplay|team play]], diplomatic relations are restricted to a binary choice between an ally or enemy. 4X games often allow more complex diplomatic relations between competitors who are not on the same team.<ref name="friendorfoe">i. {{cite web | url = http://www.gamedaily.com/games/sins-of-a-solar-empire/pc/game-reviews/item/5553/1948/ | title = Sins of a Solar Empire Review (PC) | author = GameDaily Staff | date = 2008-02-05 | accessdate = 2008-07-31 }}; <br/> ii. {{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/4x-games|title=Moby Games' 4x games Group Description|publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=2008-06-23}}; <br/> iii. {{cite web | url= http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157333 | publisher = 1UP.com | title= Sins of a Solar Empire Preview | author = Sean Molloy | accessdate = 2008-06-23}} </ref> Aside from making allies and enemies, players are also able to trade resources and information with rivals.<ref name="DeafGamersSUDG"/>

In addition to victory through conquest, 4X games usually offer peaceful victory conditions that involve no extermination of rival players.<ref name="SOSA1upinterview"/> For example, some 4X games offer victory to a player who achieves a certain score or the [[high score|highest score]] after a certain number of turns.<ref name="SpaceEmpireIV">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/p14156.htm | publisher = Game Zone | title = Space Empires IV Preview | date = 2000-08-31 | author = Michael Lafferty | accessdate= 2008-07-26}}</ref> Many 4X games award victory to the first player to master an advanced technology, accumulate a large amount of culture, or complete an awe-inspiring achievement.<ref name="victory comparison">{{cite web | url= http://pc.ign.com/articles/392/392858p1.html | publisher = IGN | author = Barry Brenesal | title = Galactic Civilizations Review | date = 2003-04-08 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}</ref> Several 4X games award "diplomatic victory" to anyone who can win an election decided by their rival players,<ref>i. {{ cite web | url = http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/master-of-orion-iii/4505-9696_7-30989341.html?hhTest=1 | publisher = CNet | title = Review - Master of Orion III (PC) | author = Sam Parker | date = 2003-03-24 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}<br/>ii. {{cite web| url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/798/798385p1.html | publisher = IGN | title = IGN Preview - Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword Hands On | author = Steve Butts | date = 2007-06-21 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}</ref> or maintain peace for a specified number of turns.<ref name="SpaceEmpireIV"/>

Since 4X games involve managing a large, detailed empire, game sessions usually last longer than other strategy games.<ref name="SOSA1upinterview">{{ cite web | url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3157343 | date = 2007-02-20 | author = GFW Staff | title=Previews: Sins of a Solar Empire | publisher=1UP.com | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}</ref> Game sessions may require several hours of play-time, which can be particularly problematic for multiplayer matches.<ref name="MOOmicro"/> For example, a small-scale campaign in ''Sins of a Solar Empire'' can last for over 12 hours.<ref name="BlogWiredSoaSReview" /> Turn-based 4X games typically divide game sessions into hundreds of turns of gameplay.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/masteroforion3/news.html?sid=2902095&mode=all | author = Sam Parker | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2002-12-18 | title = Master of Orion III Hands-On Preview | accessdate = 2008-08-19 }}</ref><ref name="IGNSE4Review"/> However, fans of the genre sometimes expect and embrace these long game sessions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/682/682382p1.html | title = Feature: Galactic Civlizations II Alien Races, Part IV | author = Stardock | publisher = IGN | date = 2007-01-19 | accessdate = 2008-08-15 }}</ref> Other 4X games such as ''[[Stars!]]'' aim for greater simplicity, resulting in quicker playing sessions.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/stars/review.html | author = T.

Because of repetitive actions and long-playing times, 4X games have been criticized for excessive [[micromanagement (computer gaming)|micromanagement]]. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games.<ref name="MOOmicro">{{ cite web | url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/preview/pc/master_of_orion_3 | publisher = Game Revolution | title=Master of Orion 3 preview for PC - Game Revolution | date = 2001-07-04 | author = Joshua Villines | accessdate=2008-07-26 }}</ref> 4X games began to offer [[artificial intelligence|AI]] [[governor]]s that automate the micromanagement of a colony's [[build order]]s, but players criticized these governors for making bad decisions.

== History ==
===Origin===
[[Image:Sid Meier cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sid Meier]], the creator of the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization series]]'' of 4X games]]

Early 4X games were influenced by [[board game]]s and [[Text-based game| text-based computer games]] from the 1970s.<ref name="gamespyHistory">{{cite web | publisher= GameSpy | author= Dave "Fargo" Kosak | title= Rich "Zdim" Carlson of Looking Glass Studios: The History of Computer Games - Part I | | url=http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/articles/devweek_l.shtm | accessdate = 2008-06-18 }}</ref> ''[[Andromeda Conquest]]'' and ''[[Reach for the Stars (computer game)| Reach for the Stars]]'' were published in 1983, and are now seen as 4X games in retrospect. Although ''Andromeda Conquest'' was only a simple game of empire expansion, ''Reach for the Stars'' introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.<ref name="earlygameconventions">{{cite web | author = Bruce Geryk | title =History of Space Empire Games - The Early Years 1980-1992 | publisher = GameSpot | url =http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/history_spaceempire/p2_01.html | date = 2001-08-08 | accessdate =2008-07-26}}</ref> 

In 1990, [[Sid Meier]] released ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' and popularized the level of detail that has become a staple of the genre.<ref name="civfirst">{{cite web | title = IGN Videogame Hall of Fame: Civilization | publisher = IGN | url=http://games.ign.com/halloffame/civilization.html | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}</ref> Sid Meier's ''Civilization'' was influenced by [[board games]] such as ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' and the [[Avalon Hill]] board game also called ''[[Civilization (board game)| Civilization]]''. A notable similarity between the ''Civilization'' computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's ''Civilization'' was also influenced by [[personal computer game]]s such as the [[city-building game|city management game]] ''[[SimCity]]'' and the [[Wargame (video games)|wargame]] ''[[Classic Empire (computer game)|Empire]]''.<ref name="civhistory">{{cite web | author=Benj Edwards |title=The History of Civilization | publisher = Gamasutra | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?page=2 | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}</ref> ''Civilization'' became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.<ref name="civfirst"/>

In 1991, two highly influential space games were released. ''[[VGA Planets]]'' was released for the PC, while ''[[Spaceward Ho!]]'' was released on the [[Macintosh]]. Although 4X space games were ultimately more influenced by the complexity of ''VGA Planets'', ''Spaceward Ho!'' earned praise for its relatively simple yet challenging game design.<ref name="1991spaceempires">{{ cite web | author = Bruce Geryk | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/pc/history_spaceempire/p2_03.html | title=GameSpot - A History of Space Empire Games: VGA Planets and Spaceward Ho! | publisher = GameSpot| date = 2001-08-08 |accessdate=2008-07-26 }}</ref> ''Spaceward Ho!'' is notable for its similarity to the 1993 game ''[[Master of Orion]]'',<ref name="Emrich1993" /><ref name"MOOgreatest">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/6132108/index.html | title = The Greatest Games of All Time: Master of Orion | publisher = GameSpot | author = Jason Ocampo | date = 2005-08-26 | accessdate = 2008-07-29 }}</ref> with its simple yet deep gameplay.<ref name="colonyscreen"/> ''Master of Orion'' also drew upon earlier 4X games such as ''Reach for the Stars'',<ref name="Emrich1993" /><ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strat04/ | title = Strategy Gaming: Part IV -- In the Beginning | publisher = GameSpy | author = Mark H.

===Peak===
Following the success of ''Civilization'' and ''Master of Orion'', other developers began releasing their own 4X games. In 1994, [[Stardock]] launched its first version of the ''[[Galactic Civilizations]]'' series for [[OS/2]],<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.stardock.com/products/gcgold/ | title=Galactic Civilizations Gold | publisher = StarDock | accessdate=2008-06-22 }}</ref> and the long-standing ''[[Space Empires]]'' series began as [[shareware]]. ''[[Ascendancy (computer game)|Ascendancy]]'' and ''[[Stars!]]'' were released in 1995, and both continued the genre's emphasis on strategic depth and empire management.<ref name=space4xintro/> Meanwhile, the ''Civilization'' and ''Master of Orion'' franchises expanded their market with versions for the Macintosh.<ref>''Master of Orion II'' was released for the Macintosh: {{ cite web | url=http://uk.gamespot.com/mac/strategy/masteroforion2/index.html | publisher = GameSpot | date = 1996 | title=Master of Orion II for Mac | accessdate=2008-06-20 }}; and so was ''Civilization'': {{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization | publisher = MobyGames | title = MobyGames - Sid Meier's Civilization | accessdate = 2008-06-24 }}</ref> Sid Meier's team also produced ''[[Colonization (computer game)|Colonization]]'' in 1994 and ''Civilization II'' in 1996,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/by_genre/developerId,3/ | publisher = MobyGames | title = MobyGames - Sid Meier Gameography | date = 2008-06-24 }}</ref> while [[Simtex]] followed up ''Master of Orion'' with ''[[Master of Magic]]'' in 1993 and ''[[Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares|Master of Orion II]]'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |author = James Fudge | date = 2000-12-30 | url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/493/493221p1.html | title = GameSpy Hall of Fame - Master of Magic | publisher = GameSpy | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}</ref>

By the late 1990s, real-time strategy games began outselling turn-based games.<ref name="gamespyRTSvsTBS">{{cite web | author = Mark H. Walker | url= http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/february02/strategygames05/index2.shtm | publisher = GameSpy | title = Strategy Gaming: Part V -- Real-Time vs. Turn-Based | date = 2002-02 | accessdate = 2008-06-24 }}</ref> As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's [[Firaxis Games]] released ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'' in 1999 to critical acclaim, but the game fell short of commercial expectations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_13/86-Alpha-Centauri.2 | title = Featured Article: Alpha Centauri | publisher = The Escapist | date = 2005-10-04 | author = Greg Tito | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}</ref> ''[[Civilization III]]'' encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |author = Kieron Gillen | url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/02/20/making-of-soren-johnson-on-civ-4/ | publisher = Rock Paper Shotgun | date = 2008-02-08 | title = Making Of: Soren Johnson On Civ 4 | accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}</ref> Despite the excitement over ''[[Master of Orion III]]'', its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak [[game artificial intelligence|AI]].<ref name="MetacriticMOO3" /> [[Video game publisher|Game publishers]] eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games.<ref name="galcivGOTY" />

===Recent history===

Eventually real-time 4X games were released, such as ''[[Imperium Galactica]]'' in 1997,<ref name="4XandRTS">{{cite web | author = Steve Butts | url=http://www.cbsgames.com/games/story/10646599 | work=CBS Games | title= News/Reviews - IGN: Sins of a Solar Empire | accessdate = 2008-03-31}}</ref> and ''[[Starships Unlimited]]'' in 2001.<ref name="DeafGamersSUDG" /> This blend of 4X and real-time strategy gameplay led [[Ironclad Games]] to market their 2008 release ''[[Sins of a Solar Empire]]'' as a "RT4X" game.<ref name=gspot_sose>i. {{cite web | author =Tim Surette | title =Sins of a Solar Empire beta unveiled | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | date =2007-03-21 | url =http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/sinsofasolarempire/news.html?sid=6167856 | accessdate =2008-07-26  }}<br /> ii. {{cite web | title =Sins of a Solar Empire | publisher =Ironclad Games | url =http://www.sinsofasolarempire.com/gameplay.aspx?c=1 | accessdate =2008-01-06 | quote =Sins of a Solar Empire is a "RT4X" game, blending the epic strategy and empire management of the 4X genre with the fast-paced and tactical elements of a real-time strategy title. }}</ref> This combination of features earned the game several Editor's Choice awards among major game publications.<ref>i. {{ cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/sinsofasolarempire/review.html?tag=tabs;reviews | title = Sins of a Solar Empire for PC Review - GameSpot | publisher = GameSpot | date = 2008-02-13 | author = Jason Ocampo | accessdate = 2008-06-24}} <br /> ii. {{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/sins-of-a-solar-empire/850906p1.html | author = Allen 'Delsyn' Rausch | title = GameSpy: Sins of a Solar Empire Review | date = 2008-02-08 | publisher = GameSpy | accessdate = 2008-06-23 }}</ref>

Cross-fertilization between board games and computer games continued. For example, some aspects of ''Master of Orion III'' were drawn from the board game [[Twilight Imperium]].<ref name="MOO3DesignerDiaryDec2000">{{ cite web | url=http://moo3.quicksilver.com/diary/1200.html | title=Master of Orion III - Designer's Diary | date = 2000-12-13 | publisher = QuickSilver Software |  accessdate = 2008-07-26 }}</ref>  Even ''Sins of a Solar Empire'' was inspired by the idea of adapting the board game [[Buck Rogers - Battle for the 25th Century|Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century]] into a real-time video game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3638/postmortem_ironcladstardocks_.php | title = Postmortem: Ironclad/Stardock's Sins of a Solar Empire | author = Blair Fraser and Brad Wardell | publisher = Gamasutra | date = 2008-04-28 | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref> Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of ''Sid Meier's Civilization'' in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/pirates-2004/540850p1.html | date = 2004-08-20 | author = Andrew S.

In 2003, [[Stardock]] released a remake of ''[[Galactic Civilizations]]'', which was praised by reviewers who saw the game as a replacement for the ''Master of Orion'' series.<ref>i. {{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=63130 | title = Review: Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords | author = Kieron Gillen | date = 2006-03-06 | publisher = EuroGamer | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}; </br> ii. {{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3102896&p=1 | title = Reviews: Galactic Civilizations | author = 1up Staff | publisher = 1up | date = 2003-03-26 | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}</ref> ''[[Civilization IV]]'' was released at the end of 2005 and was considered the PC game of the year according to several reviewers, including [[GameSpot]] and [[GameSpy]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/awards.htm | publisher = 2K Games | title = Civ IV Recognized in "Best of 2005" Awards | date = 2005-12-20 | accessdate = 2008-07-26}}</ref> It is now considered one of the greatest games in history, having been ranked the second-best PC game of all time by [[IGN]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/772/772285p3.html | title = Top 25 PC Games of All Time | author = Dan Adams, Steve Butts, Charles Onyett | date = 2007-03-16 | publisher = IGN | accessdate = 2008-07-29 }}</ref> By 2008, the ''Civilization'' series had sold over eight million copies,<ref name=civsales>{{cite web | author =Matt Martin | title =Grand Theft Auto series has sold 66 million units to date| publisher = gamesindustry.biz | url =http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/grand-theft-auto-series-has-sold-66-million-units-to-date | accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref> and ''[[Civilization Revolution]]'' was released for [[Video game console|game consoles]] soon after.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=79874 | date = 2007-07-16 | title= Firaxis explains lack of Civ PSP | accessdate = 2008-07-26 | author = Tom Bramwell |  publisher= EuroGamer}}</ref> Meanwhile, Stardock released ''[[Galactic Civilizations 2]]'', which was considered the sixth-best PC game of 2006 by GameSpy.<ref name="galcivGOTY"/> This success has led Stardock's [[Brad Wardell]] to assert that 4X games have excellent growth potential, particularly among less hardcore players.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14842 | date = 2007-07-26 | title=Stardock's Wardell Talks ''GalCiv'', Indie Power | publisher = Gamasutra | author = Alistair Wallis | accessdate=2008-07-26 }}</ref> This is in addition to the loyal base of 4X gamers who have supported [[freeware]] releases such as ''[[Freeciv]]'',<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/freeciv | title = Mobygames: Freeciv | publisher = MobyGames | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}</ref> and ''[[C-evo]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=72321 | title = Priceless Victories | author = Oliver Clare | publisher = EuroGamer | date = 2007-01-29 | accessdate = 2008-07-28 }}</ref>
