The '''Philadelphia Phillies' 2009 season''' was the 127th season in the [[History of the Philadelphia Phillies|history of the franchise]]. The team, managed by [[Charlie Manuel]], began their sixth season at [[Citizens Bank Park]] and defense of their [[2008 World Series]] championship on April 5.  After collecting a third straight [[National League East|Eastern Division]] championship, the Phillies won their second consecutive National League pennant for the first time in franchise history; they were defeated by the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[2009 World Series]].

The Phillies posted a second consecutive winning April to open the season with an 11&ndash;9 record, but the month was marred by the death of "legendary" broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/story/11625834|title=Legendary Phillies announcer Kalas dead at 73|date=April 13, 2009|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> After opening the month of May against the rival [[New York Mets]], the Phillies met President [[Barack Obama]] to celebrate their World Series victory the previous season, and had two rookie pitchers win consecutive starts for the first time since 2007. Starting pitcher [[Jamie Moyer]] earned his 250th career win during the month, while first baseman [[Ryan Howard]] and outfielder [[Ra<U+00FA>l Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez]] became the first Phillies teammates to hit 10 home runs in the same month. Echoing their strong run in the middle of the [[2008 Philadelphia Phillies season|2008 season]], the Phillies compiled a 16&ndash;4 record in late May and early June, which was countered by weakness during [[interleague play]] in late June. 

After the team's largest victory of the season (22&ndash;1 over the Cincinnati Reds) in early July, five Phillies<U+2014>Howard, Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez, second baseman [[Chase Utley]], and outfielders [[Shane Victorino]] and [[Jayson Werth]]<U+2014>were selected to the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]]. July was the team's best showing of the season, as they compiled their first 20-win month since the [[2001 Philadelphia Phillies season|2001 season]]. The Phillies traded for starting pitcher [[Cliff Lee]] at the end of the month to bolster their starting rotation, who won his first five starts with the team, and signed free-agent pitcher [[Pedro Mart<U+00ED>nez]]. In August, [[Eric Bruntlett]] turned the first game-ending [[unassisted triple play]] in National League history, and the second in team history. The following month, the team clinched its third consecutive division championship on September 30, becoming the first Phillies team to make a third straight playoff appearance since the 1976&ndash;1978 Phillies.

Philadelphia defeated the [[Colorado Rockies]] in the [[2009 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] (NLDS), 3&ndash;1, and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the [[2009 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] (NLCS) for the second consecutive year, 4&ndash;1. Howard was named the [[League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award|most valuable player of the NLCS]]. The Phillies were defeated by the Yankees in the World Series, four games to two.

Statistical leaders{{ref label|Stats|A|A}} in batting for the 2009 team included Victorino ([[batting average]], .292), Howard ([[home run]]s, 45; [[run batted in|runs batted in]], 141), and Utley ([[run (baseball)|runs]] scored, 112). For his season accomplishments, Utley won his fourth consecutive [[Silver Slugger Award]]. Pitching leaders included right-handed starting pitcher [[Joe Blanton]] ([[innings pitched]],&nbsp;{{frac|195|1|3}}), left-handed starter {{nowrap|[[J. A. Happ]]}} ([[Win (baseball)|win<U+2013>loss record]],&nbsp;12<U+2013>4), and relief pitcher [[Brad Lidge]] (saves,&nbsp;31). Victorino and shortstop [[Jimmy Rollins]] also won [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award]]s for their play in the field.

Struggles continued for the Phillies to open July, as the Braves completed a three-game series sweep in the first two days of the month; however, a face-off with the Mets over the [[Independence Day]] weekend revitalized the team's fortunes. The Phillies swept their northern rivals as the Mets managed only three runs in three games. During the series, the team's [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2009 All-Stars]] were announced: Utley and Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez were elected as starters, and Howard was named as a reserve, one of four first basemen selected to the National League squad. It was also announced that Victorino was one of the five "Final Vote" candidates. Though the Phillies had played much better on the road to this point in the season, home-field advantage paid off the next night, as the offense chased Reds starter [[Johnny Cueto]] after {{frac|2|3}} of an inning by scoring nine runs; the team went on to score 10 in the first inning and 22 in the entire game.<ref name="22runs"/> Every Phillies starter had at least one hit, Werth hit an eighth-inning grand slam off of Reds infielder [[Paul Janish]], and Rollins and Victorino, at the top of the order, combined to go 7-for-9 with three doubles, a home run, nine runs scored, and five RBIs between them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI200907060.shtml|title=Cincinnati Reds at Philadelphia Phillies Boxscore|date=July 6, 2009|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=July 10, 2009}}</ref> Though closer Lidge suffered a tough loss on July 7, sacrificing a run in the ninth inning to earn his fourth of the season, the Phillies bounced back with a dramatic ninth-inning win the following night.

The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] were the National League's #1 seed by virtue of the best record entering the playoffs; thus, the Phillies traveled to [[Chavez Ravine]] for the opener of the playoffs' second round, the [[List of most common Major League Baseball postseason matchups|fifth postseason meeting]] between the two clubs. [[James Loney]] opened the scoring for the Dodgers with a solo home run in the bottom of the second inning, but the Phillies answered back with a five-run fifth inning, chasing starter [[Clayton Kershaw]]. [[Manny Ram<U+00ED>rez]]' two-run home run in the bottom of the inning made the score 5<U+2013>4, but [[Ra<U+00FA>l Iba<U+00F1>ez]] followed with a three-run home run in the top of the eighth.

The series moved to Philadelphia for the third game, and the Phillies capitalized on their home crowd immediately, scoring four runs in the first inning of the game. Lee continued his "superb" postseason performance<ref name="NLCSGame3Wrap"/> with an eight-inning shutout performance, allowing three singles and a stolen base. Lee and his [[Battery (baseball)|batterymate]] Ruiz had higher offensive production in Game 3 (three hits in six at-bats, three runs scored, one run batted in) than the entire Dodger lineup (three hits in twenty-seven at bats, no runs scored).

Los Angeles closer Broxton entered the game in the bottom of the eighth<U+2014>after [[George Sherrill]] allowed two runners to reach base<U+2014>and coaxed Werth to fly out. Broxton returned to the mound in the bottom of the ninth, inducing a ground ball from Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez before walking [[Matt Stairs]] and hitting Ruiz.

===World Series===

{{main|2009 World Series}}
The Phillies played the [[New York Yankees]] in a three-game series over the [[Memorial Day]] weekend during the regular season in May. Rollins, a harbinger of things to come, said:
<blockquote>How great would that be? A World Series here, us against the Yankees?<U+2026> We've proved we can put on a pretty good show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lisa-olson.fanhouse.com/2009/05/24/yankees-phillies-deliver-october-feel/ |title=Yankees, Phillies Deliver October Feel |last=Olson |first=Lisa|publisher=FanHouse.com |date=May 24, 2009|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>
The Yankees defeated the Phillies, four games to two, to win the franchise's record 27th World Series championship. The Yankees had home field advantage for the series, due to an [[American League]] victory in the [[2009 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2009 All-Star Game]]. In addition to the 27th championship for New York, several records were tied, extended, or broken during the Series, including postseason wins ([[Andy Pettitte]] with 18), home runs in a World Series (Utley with 5), strikeouts by a batter in a World Series (Howard with 13), saves in a World Series ([[Mariano Rivera]] with 11), and RBI in a single World Series game ([[Hideki Matsui]] with 6).

The two previous years' American League [[Cy Young Award]] winners started the game: [[CC Sabathia]], for the Yankees; and Lee, for the Phillies. Sabathia, who had been 3<U+2013>0 in the postseason to date, pitched seven innings and allowed two [[earned run]]s on four hits; Lee, however, pitched a [[complete game]] and allowed no earned runs to go the distance for the second time during the 2009 postseason. The Phillies offense was paced by Utley, who walked in the first inning to set a record of 26 consecutive postseason games reaching base, and hit solo home runs in the third and sixth innings. Philadelphia led 2<U+2013>0 until the eighth inning, when an Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez single scored Rollins and Victorino, and added two more runs in the top of the ninth inning on a Victorino single and a Howard double. The Phillies allowed an unearned run in the bottom of the ninth when Rollins committed a throwing error, tossing the ball past Howard at first base and into the Yankee dugout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA200910280.shtml|title=2009 World Series Game 1|first=2009-10-28|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=October 29, 2009}}</ref>

{{seealso|Philadelphia Phillies Radio Network}}
Over-the-air television returned to [[WPHL-TV]] ([[My Network TV|My PHL 17]]) for a three-year period after a ten-year stint at [[WPSG-TV]] ([[The CW|CW 57]]), when the Phillies and the Tribune Broadcasting station signed a three-year contract on November 19, 2008. This marks the third time the station has become the territorial [[flagship station]], the first being from 1971 to 1982<U+2014>as the successor to WFIL-TV Channel 6 (now [[WPVI-TV]])<U+2014>and again from 1993 to 1998. Between those dates, games were telecast by [[WTXF-TV]] Channel 29 (known as WTAF-TV from 1983 through 1987 and prior to becoming a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]<U+2013>[[owned-and-operated]] station).

[[Tom McCarthy (broadcaster)|Tom McCarthy]], [[Chris Wheeler]], and [[Gary Matthews]] are the current members of the television broadcast team. McCarthy took over full-time [[Sports commentary|play-by-play]] duties from [[Harry Kalas]] after his passing in mid-April 2009. Wheeler is the [[color commentator]] for the first and last three innings of each game, while Matthews does color commentary in the middle three innings. On the radio, [[Scott Franzke]] and [[Larry Andersen]] are the play-by-play and color commentators, respectively, for the [[English language]] broadcasts on [[WPHT-AM]] (1210), while Danny Martinez and Bill Kulik provide the [[Spanish language]] commentary on [[WUBA]] (1480 AM).

The Phillies' postseason radio duties were split between the TV crew and the regular radio crew, while the television broadcasts on [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] were covered by [[Brian Anderson (broadcaster)|Brian Anderson]], [[Joe Simpson (baseball)|Joe Simpson]], and [[David Aldridge]] for the Division Series, and [[Chip Caray]], [[Ron Darling]], and [[Buck Martinez]] for the League Championship Series. The [[List of World Series broadcasters|World Series broadcasters]] were [[Joe Buck]] and [[Tim McCarver]] on the Fox telecasts, and [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Jon Miller]] on [[ESPN Radio]] for the national broadcast.
