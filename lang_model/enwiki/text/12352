He was previously was a member of the [[Saint-Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Leonard]] city council and chair of the [[Commission scolaire J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me-Le Royer]].

==Private career==
Perri holds a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and a [[Master's degree]] and is a high-school science teacher in private life..<ref>"Who is running for seats on eight school boards," ''Montreal Gazette'', 14 November 1987, p. 16; Adelia Cellini, "Inventive student; Looking for sponsor to develop portable diagnostic device," ''Montreal Gazette'', 4 October 1995, C4; [http://www.unionmontreal.com/saint-leonard/lequipe/dominic-perri/?lang=en Dominic Perri - Saint-L<U+00E9>onard-Ouest District], Union Montreal, accessed 28 September 2011.</ref>

==Saint-Leonard councillor==
Perri was elected for Saint-Leonard's sixth district in the [[Montreal municipal election, 1982|1982 municipal election]] as a candidate of mayor [[Antonio di Ciocco]]'s [[<U+00C9>quipe du renouveau de la cit<U+00E9> de Saint-L<U+00E9>onard]]. The party fragmented after Di Ciocco's death in 1984, and Perri joined the [[Ralliement de Saint-L<U+00E9>onard]] under new mayor [[Raymond Renaud]].

Perri considered running for mayor of Saint-Leonard in [[Saint-Leonard municipal election, 1986|1986]], saying that he had been approached by local politicians such as [[Michel Bissonnet]]. When Renaud announced that he would seek another term, Perri decided against challenging him and was instead re-elected to council.<ref>"Board head may seek mayor's job," ''Montreal Gazette'', 10 July 1986, p. 5; "List of mayoral candidates may grow," ''Montreal Gazette'', 31 July 1986, p. 7; "Five new candidates join St. Leonard mayor's slate," ''Montreal Gazette'', 2 October 1986, p. 8; "Results of council elections in 18 Montreal-area municipalities," ''Montreal Gazette'', 3 November 1986, p. 8.</ref>

In 1988, Perri joined with [[Frank Zampino]] and six other Saint-Leonard councillors in resigning from Renaud's party. Charging that Renaud's administration was undemocratic, the rebels established new municipal committees to oversee policy and increase civic participation in government.<ref>"Eight St. Leonard city councillors quit mayor's 'undemocratic' party," ''Montreal Gazette'', 5 May 1988, p. 3; "St. Leonard councillors aim to inform residents," ''Montreal Gazette'', 19 May 1988, p. 8.</ref> The group coalesced as the [[Parti Municipal (Saint-Leonard)|Parti municipal]], and Perri was re-elected under its banner in [[Saint-Leonard municipal election, 1990|1990]], [[Saint-Leonard municipal election, 1994|1994]], and [[Saint-Leonard municipal election, 1998|1998]].<ref>Mike King, "Zampino, 8 councillors acclaimed in St. Leonard," ''Montreal Gazette'', 18 October 1994, p. 6; Irwin Block, "Second acclamation in a row for Zampino," ''Montreal Gazette'', 15 October 1998, p. 6.</ref>

==School board commissioner==
Perri was elected to the Commission scolaire J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me-Le Royer in [[Commission scolaire J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me-Le Royer election, 1980|1980]] and re-elected in [[Commission scolaire J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me-Le Royer election, 1983|1983]]. He became chair of the board in 1984, succeeding Alfonso Gagliano, who had been elected to the [[Canadian House of Commons]].<ref>"Board head may seek mayor's job," ''Montreal Gazette'', 10 July 1986, p. 5.</ref>

;Language issues
Perri welcomed the creation of an English-language educational services department in early 1985, saying that it would permit his board's anglophone students to access "maximum services." A single department had previously overseen both French and English services.<ref>"Board improves English services," ''Montreal Gazette'', 23 January 1985, p. 2.</ref> Later in the year, Perri announced that his board would also start providing recreational and crafts services in English.<ref>"St. Leonard OKs classes in English," ''Montreal Gazette'', 24 July 1985, p. 3.</ref> 

Perri supported measures to increase [[Official bilingualism in Canada|bilingualism]] among his board's students. He oversaw an expansion in French-language education for anglophone students, saying, "I'd like our kids coming out of English school completely bilingual."<ref>Debbie Parkes, "Le Royer will increase teaching time of French," ''Montreal Gazette'', 1 May 1986, p. 10.</ref> He also promoted a voluntary pilot project for francophone students to receive English-language instruction as early as the first grade.<ref>"Look at English class alternatives: Perri," ''Montreal Gazette'', 20 November 1986, p. 1; "Plan to expand English teaching causes a storm," ''Montreal Gazette'', 30 April 1987, p. 4; Debbie Parkes, "English offered in Grade 1 despite bid to block move," ''Montreal Gazette'', 11 June 1987, p. 7; Debbie Parkes, "Board firm: no retreat on English in Grade 1," ''Montreal Gazette'', 9 July 1987, p. 1; Catherine Buckie, "Quebec silent: English project is set," ''Montreal Gazette'', 13 August 1987, p. 4; Jeannie Stiglic, "Grade 1 English classes set to begin - without Education Department's OK," ''Montreal Gazette'', 1 October 1987, p. 8.</ref>

Perri opposed efforts to replace Quebec's denominational school system with a language-based system, arguing that the shift would be detrimental to English schools.<ref>"Scrap religious boards to save English education, meeting told," ''Montreal Gazette'', 4 April 1986, p. 1.</ref>

;Other issues
In 1985, Perri supported a plan to shift 450 French-sector Grade Seven students to a local comprehensive school to create educational space for an equal number of younger students. Some parents opposed this plan, arguing that the comprehensive school was too large and that the seventh graders would be exposed to the bad habits of older students.<ref>"Decision on fate of 900 students due next month," ''Montreal Gazette'', 20 February 1985, p. 6; Debbie Parkes, "School transfer is going ahead despite protests," ''Montreal Gazette'', 20 March 1985, p. 1; "Parents win major battle in school-transfer fight," ''Montreal Gazette'', 22 May 1985, p. 1; "Angry parents plan to protest school decision," ''Montreal Gazette'', 12 June 1985, p. 1.</ref> As a compromise, the board proposed constructing a wall that would divide the comprehensive school into two units; it was refused permission to do this by the province's education department.<ref>"Board may ignore order not to build wall to divide school," ''Montreal Gazette'', 17 April 1985, p. 5.</ref> The student transfer ultimately did not take place.<ref>Debbie Parkes, "Placing Grade 7s divides school board," ''Montreal Gazette'', 6 March 1986, p. 7; "Grade 7 switch a dead issue - Jerome Le Royer chairman," ''Montreal Gazette'', 5 June 1986, p. 6.</ref>

;After 1987
When running for re-election in [[Commission scolaire J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me-Le Royer election, 1987|1987]], Perri called for an increased focus on English, French, maths, and sciences and a reduction in the number of elective courses.<ref>"4 alliances fight for control of Jerome Le Royer board," ''Montreal Gazette'', 12 November 1987, p. 10.</ref> His political partnership with fellow commissioner [[Joe Morselli]] dissolved during this election, and, although Perri was himself re-elected, only one other member of his governing alliance was returned to the board.<ref>"Anjou candidates blame their loss on mayor's letter," ''Montreal Gazette'', 19 November 1987, p. 15; Debbie Parkes, "Municipal alliances show in school vote," ''Montreal Gazette'', 26 November 1987, p. 7.</ref> The new elected board chose Morselli to succeed Perri as chair and discontinued Perri's pilot project of teaching English to first-grade francophone students shortly thereafter.<ref>"Morselli elected to head Jerome Le Royer; Former foes back new chairman in exchange for policy support," ''Montreal Gazette'', 26 November 1987, p. 7; "English instruction in Grade 1 in jeopardy," ''Montreal Gazette'', 3 December 1987, p. 11; "Enrolment boost sought through immersion plan," ''Montreal Gazette'', 3 March 1988, p. 6.</ref>

==Montreal city council==
Saint-Leonard was amalgamated into the [[City of Montreal]] in 2001, and Perri was elected to the Montreal city council in [[Montreal municipal election, 2001|that year's municipal election]] as a candidate of G<U+00E9>rald Tremblay's [[Montreal Island Citizens' Union]].<ref>Jane Davenport, "Let prosperity reign: Many in St. Leonard believe merger can only enrich the lively town," ''Montreal Gazette'', 6 October 2001, p. 6; "'We showed who's boss': Team Tremblay captures the east," ''Montreal Gazette'', 5 November 2001, p. 7.</ref> He was re-elected in [[Montreal municipal election, 2005|2005]] and [[Montreal municipal election, 2009|2009]]. He has served on the board of the [[Montreal Transit Corporation]] and has chaired its subsidiary, Transgesco LP, since its creation. Part of the Transgesco LP mandate includes the development of new technologies allowing for an improvement of customer experience.<ref>James Mennie, "Transit subsidiary's contracts a tender spot," ''Montreal Gazette', 17 September 2004, p. 6; "Scotiabank branches out to Metro McGill," ''Canada Newswire'', 20 April 2009.</ref>

By virtue of serving on the Montreal city council, Perri also serves on the [[Saint-Leonard borough council]]. He chaired the borough's planning advisory committee from 2002 until 2010.<ref>[http://www.progresstleonard.com/Actualites/Vos-nouvelles/2010-05-05/article-1053720/Saint-Leonard-%3A-Dominic-Perri-ecarte-de-la-presidence-du-CCU/1 Guillaume Picard, "Saint-L<U+00E9>onard : Dominic Perri <U+00E9>cart<U+00E9> de la pr<U+00E9>sidence du CCU"], ''Progr<U+00E8>s Saint-L<U+00E9>onard'', 5 May 2010, accessed 28 June 2011.</ref> In 2005, he introduced a motion for Saint-Leonard to ban [[pit bull]] dogs.<ref>Anne Sutherland, "St. Leonard eyes pit bull ban," ''Montreal Gazette'', 12 January 2005, p. 9.</ref> He also initiated a ban on wood burning in Montreal which led to a municipal bylaw forbidding wood burning in new contructions.<ref>Joel Ceausu, "Wood stoves being phased out," ''The Suburban'', 24 August 2011, p. 83.</ref>

==Federal politics==
Perri campaigned with [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] candidate [[Massimo Pacetti]] in a federal by-election in 2002.<ref>Hubert Bauch, "Gagliano's former riding a Liberal bastion," ''Montreal Gazette'', 12 May 2002, p. 4.</ref>
