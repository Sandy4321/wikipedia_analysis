The '''Theological Institute of N<U+00EE>mes''' (also named '''ITN''') is a [[Baptist]]-oriented college and seminary created in [[Uchaud]], [[Gard]], in 1989 by Louis DeMeo, a [[Baptist]] pastor of the American [[Greater Grace World Outreach]] Church. Thereafter, the institute moved to Montpellier. This institute was mainly known for its inclusion on the list of dangerous [[cult]]s established by the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]] in the 1995 report, which led to a public controversy involving the American Department of State and several international associations which disapproved the decision.

==History==
Established in 1989, the institute was directed by Louis DeMeo, a pastor of the American [[Greater Grace World Outreach]] Church, whose heartquarters are located in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Larkin |title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Annual Report: Submitted by the U.S |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=OTx1qbA8OW8C&pg=PA293&dq=%22Institut+th%C3%A9ologique+de+N%C3%AEmes%22&lr=#v=onepage&q=institut&f=false |page=294 |year=2001 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> However, in spite of the ties of its founder with the American church, the ITN was organized as "an independent Baptist group", as noted by Italian sociologist [[Massimo Introvigne]].<ref name="Journal">{{cite journal |journal=Marburg Journal of Religion |title=The French and German versus American debate over 'New religions', Scientology, and Human Rights |url=http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/mjr/kent2.html#81 |first=Stephen A. |last=Kent |volume=6 |number=1 |date=January 2001 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Expert of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism]] [[S<U+00E9>bastien Fath]] said that the ITN was "originally characterized by voluntary isolation from all French evangelical existing networks", a "very pronounced anti-social speech, almost [[self-sufficient]] practices".<ref name="Fath"/> He also said that it was in "considerable out of phase with its environment, coupled with a propensity for a victimizing reading of its situation (though more due to its wanted isolation than its religious identity)", but he also said that the situation would have changed since.<ref>{{cite web |first=S<U+00E9>bastien |last=Fath |title=Aspects psychosociologiques et historiques <U+2014> " Approches de la sociologie religieuse " <U+2014> Les "<U+00E9>vang<U+00E9>liques" <U+2014> D<U+00E9>finition et mise en perspective |url=http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Fath.pdf |work= |publisher=[[MIVILUDES]] |language=French |format=PDF |page=9 |date= |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> After several years of existence, the college was closed on the ground of "illegal operation of a private school",<ref name="Midi Libre">{{cite journal |first=Richard |last=Boudes |title=Paroles d'<U+00E9>vangile |url=http://www.prevensectes.com/rev9812.htm#p |journal=Midi Libre |language=French |date=October 1998 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> and moved to [[Montpellier]] where it took another name.<ref name="Fath">{{cite book |first=S<U+00E9>bastien |last=Fath |authorlink=S<U+00E9>bastien Fath |title=Du ghetto au r<U+00E9>seau: le protestantisme <U+00E9>vang<U+00E9>lique en France (1800-2005) |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=Z2dufS4Sdy8C&pg=PA262&dq=institut+th%C3%A9ologique+de+n%C3%AEmes&hl=fr&ei=bKVvTOieB6ikOIad1LAL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=institut%20th%C3%A9ologique%20de%20n%C3%AEmes&f=false |place=Gen<U+00E8>ve |publisher=Labor et Fides |year=2005 |language=French |page=262 |isbn=2-8309-1139-3 |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>

==Reception==
In France, the Institute was classified as a [[cult]] in the [[List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents|1995 parliamentary reports]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enqu<U+00EA>te sur les sectes <U+2014> ''Les sectes en France'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher=''Assembl<U+00E9>e Nationale'' |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> Following this classification, pastor Louis DeMeo who directed the Institute testified before the [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]], in [[Washington, DC]], arguing violations of religious freedom by the French government. DeMeo said that his Institute underwent an alleged "persecution" just after the publication of the parliamentary report.<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=French Bible college faces persecution |url=http://www.hrwf.net/religiousfreedom/news/france2001.html#FrenchBiblecollegefaces |work= |publisher=Human Rights Without Frontiers |date=2 March 2001 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> He mentioned as examples an explosion and four burned cars by a stranger, problems of bank accounts for several ITN students, refusal of a [[building permit]] for a church,<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Ireland |title=French Bible College Faces Persecution |url=http://www.crosswalk.com/525118/ |work=Religion Today |publisher=Crosswalk |date=1 March 2001 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> the fact that two members were fired from their jobs,<ref>{{cite web |first=Jack |last=Kinsella |title='And Ye Shall Be Hated For My Name's Sake' |url=http://www.omegaletter.com/articles/articles.asp?ArticleID=909 |work= |publisher=''Omegaletter'' |date=30 March 2003 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> accusations of [[brainwashing]] on children, and denial of access to a public hall.<ref name="Journal"/> He said that the inclusion of ITN on the cults list was "extremely unjust, given the fact [they] have never been given an official hearing or explanation for [their] inclusion on this list",<ref>{{cite web |title=French 'anti-sect' bill decried |url=http://www.canadianchristianity.com/cgi-bin/bc.cgi?bc/bccn/0401/intfrench |work=BBC Christian News |publisher=Canadian Christianity |date=April 2001 |accessdate=3 September 2001}}</ref> and generated discriminatory behaviors.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bureau de la d<U+00E9>mocratie, des droits de l'homme, et du travail du D<U+00E9>partement d'<U+00C9>tat |title=Rapport de l'ann<U+00E9>e 2000 sur la libert<U+00E9> religieuse internationale.

As the ITN is Baptist-oriented, which is one of the main religions in United States, its inclusion in the list of dangerous cults received much attention from the US Department of State which strongly criticized this decision and devoted to this four paragraphs in its 1999 Annual Report on Religious Freedom.<ref name="Journal"/> The Institute received support from several organizations through their officials who defended it. For example, the [[Rutherford Institute]], an international civil liberties and human rights legal defense organization, wrote to [[Alain Vivien]], then member of the [[Mission interminist<U+00E9>rielle de lutte contre les sectes]], to ask him to remove the ITN from the list of cults.<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=Whitehead |title=Letter of the Rutherford Institute to the President of the Interministerial Mission Against Sects |url=http://www.hrwf.net/religiousfreedom/news/1999PDF/france_1999.pdf |work=New Repressive French Law Proposition Against Religious Minorities |publisher=hrwf |pages=21, 22 |format=PDF |year=1999 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> Willy Fautr<U+00E9>, a member of [[Human Rights Without Frontiers]], criticized the fact that the ITN was presented in the media as "a disturbing tentacular organisation" and the pastor as a "guru".<ref>{{cite web |first=Willy |last=Fautr<U+00E9> |title=Legal Regulation of Religious Communities in EU <U+2014> Member States: A Human Rights Perspective |url=http://www.willyfautre.org/publications/2009/0314%20Article%20Odessa.pdf |work=Human Rights Without Frontiers (Brussels) |format=PDF |page=10 |year=2009 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> Member of the United States Department of State's Commission of International Religious Freedom Jeremy T. Gunn met the MILS on 6 April 1999 and discussed about the Institute, reiterating DeMeo's claims to the anti-cult organization.<ref name="Journal"/>

According to its critics, DeMeo's parent church, the Greater Grace World Outreach, would be "a fellow traveler of the [[Church of Scientology]]".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Bruno |last=Fouchereau |title=Les sectes, cheval de Troie des Etats-Unis en Europe |url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2001/05/FOUCHEREAU/15215 |journal=[[Le Monde Diplomatique]] |publisher= |language=French |date=May 2001 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Alain |last=Vivien |title=Les sectes |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=He5km9fzpkcC&pg=PA165&dq=institut+th%C3%A9ologique+de+n%C3%AEmes&hl=fr&ei=bKVvTOieB6ikOIad1LAL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=institut%20th%C3%A9ologique%20de%20n%C3%AEmes&f=false |isbn=2-7381-1284-6 |page=165 |language=French |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> The MILS pointed out that complaints for the cars destroyed were the subject of police investigations which were unable to attribute the origin of this incident to external responsibilities, because of a lack of evidence.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Mission interminist<U+00E9>rielle de lutte contre les sectes]] |title=Rapport 2000 |url=http://lesrapports.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/BRP/004000552/0000.pdf |work= |publisher=La Documentation fran<U+00E7>aise |language=French |format=PDF |page=19 |year=2000 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref> In the press, former ITN followers criticized the institute for important calls for donation, pressures exerted on the followers, interventions in private life, family breakdowns and demonization of the external world.<ref name="Midi Libre"/>

On 27 May 2005, the 1995 annex of the French report and cult classifications in which the Institute was listed, were officially cancelled and invalidated by [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s circulaire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/content/societe/article?id=19641 |title=La fin des listes noires |work=[[Le Point]] |language=French |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref>
