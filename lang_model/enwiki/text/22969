'''Pope Saint Pius X''' ([[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''Pius PP. X'') (2 June, 1835 <U+2013> 20 August, 1914), born '''Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto''', was the 258th [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]], serving from 1903 to 1914, succeeding [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1878<U+2013>1903). He was the first pope since [[Pope Pius V]] (1566<U+2013>72) to be [[Canonization|canonised]]. Pius X codified Catholic doctrines to inspire conformity in the church and rejected modernism. His most important reform codified Church law in a central fashion. He was a pastoral pope, encouraging personal piety and a lifestyle reflecting Christian values. He was born in the pastoral town of Riese.

Pope Pius was a [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Marian]] Pope, whose encyclical [[Ad Diem Illum]] expresses his desire through Mary to ''renew all things in Christ'', which he had defined as his motto in his first encyclical. Pius believed that there is no surer or more direct road than by Mary to achieve this goal.<ref>Ad diem illum 5 (http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_02021904_ad-diem-illum-laetissimum_en.html)</ref> Pius X  was the only Pope in the 20th century with extensive pastoral experience at the [[parish]] level, and pastoral concerns permeated his papacy; he favoured the use of the vernacular in [[catechesis]]. Frequent communion was a lasting  innovation of his papacy. Pius X, like [[Pope Pius IX]], was considered by some to be too outspoken or brusque. His direct style and condemnations did not gain him much support in the aristocratic  societies of pre-[[World War I]] in Europe.

His immediate predecessor had actively promoted a synthesis between the Catholic Church and secular culture; faith and science; and divine revelation and reason.<ref>Joseph Lortz, Geschichte der Kirche, M<U+00FC>nster, 1934, <U+00A7>113</ref> Pius X defended the Catholic faith  against popular 19th century views  such as [[indifferentism]] and [[relativism]] which his predecessors had warned against as well.<ref>Gregory XVI Mirari Vos, 1832, Pius IX, Syllabus of Errors.</ref> He followed the example of Leo XIII by promoting [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Thomism]] as the principal philosophical method to be taught in Catholic institutions. Pius opposed the theological school of thought known as [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernism]], which claimed that [[Roman Catholic Dogma]] itself should be modernized and blended with nineteenth century  philosophies. He viewed modernism as an import of secular errors affecting  three areas of Roman Catholic belief: [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and dogma.<ref>Lortz <U+00A7>113,2</ref>  

Personally, Pius combined within himself a strong sense of [[compassion]], [[benevolence]], [[poverty]], but also [[stubbornness]],  and a certain stiffness.<ref>Hans K<U+00FC>hner Lexikon der P<U+00E4>pste, Fischer Frankfurt, 1960 183 </ref>  He wanted to be pastor and was the only pope in the 20th century who gave Sunday sermons every week. His charity was extraordinary, filling the [[Vatican]] with refugees from the 1908 Messina quake, long before the Italian government began to act on its own.<ref name="K<U+00FC>hner 183">K<U+00FC>hner 183</ref> He rejected any kind of favours for his family; his brother remained a postal clerk, his favourite nephew stayed on as village priest, and his three sisters lived together close to poverty in Rome.<ref name="K<U+00FC>hner 183"/> He often referred to his own humble origins, taking up the causes of poor people. ''I was born poor, I have lived poor, and I wish to die poor''.<ref name="franciscan-sfo.org">www.franciscan-sfo.org/fviews/pius_x.htm</ref> Considered a holy person by many, public veneration of Pope Pius began soon after his death. Numerous petitions resulted in an early process of [[beatification]].<ref name="franciscan-sfo.org"/>

== Early life and ministry ==
[[Image:PiusXkitchen.jpg|thumb|190px|left|''Kitchen of the Sarto family in Riese'']]
'''Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto''' was born in [[Riese]], [[province of Treviso]] ([[Veneto]]), [[Italy]]. He was the second born of ten children of Giovanni Battista Sarto (1792<U+2013>1852) and Margarita Sanson (1813<U+2013>1894). He was baptised [[3 June]] [[1835]]. Giuseppe's childhood was one of poverty, being the son of the village [[postman]]. Though poor, his parents valued education, and Giuseppe walked 6 kilometers to school each day.

Giuseppe had 3 brothers and 6 sisters : Giuseppe Sarto, 1834 (died after 6 days) Angelo Sarto, 1837-1916 Teresa Parolin-Sarto, 1839-1920 Rosa Sarto, 1841-1913 Antonia Dei Bei-Sarto, 1843-1917 Maria Sarto, 1846-1930 Lucia Boschin-Sarto, 1848-1924 Anna Sarto, 1850-1926 Pietro Sarto, 1852 (died after 6 months).<ref>http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=00055r</ref>

At a young age, Giuseppe studied [[Latin language|Latin]] with his village priest, and went on to study at the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] of [[Castelfranco Veneto]]. "In 1850 he received the [[tonsure]] from the [[Bishop of Treviso]], and was given a scholarship [from] the Diocese of Treviso" to attend the Seminary of [[Padua]], "where he finished his classical, philosophical, and theological studies with distinction".<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12137a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope Pius X<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Image:Mlad<U+00FD> Jozef Sarto - neskor<U+0161><U+00ED> p<U+00E1>pe<U+017E> Pius X..jpg|thumb|180px|right|A young Giuseppe Sarto]]
On 18 September 1858, Sarto was ordained a priest, and became chaplain at [[Tombolo]]. While there, Father Sarto expanded his knowledge of [[theology]], studying both [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], while carrying out most of the functions of the [[parish]] pastor, who was quite ill. In 1867, he was named [[Archpriest]] of [[Salzano]]. Here he restored the Church and expanded the hospital, the funds coming from his own begging, wealth and labour. He became popular with the people when he worked to assist the sick during the [[cholera]] plague that swept into northern Italy in the early 1870s.
He was named a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the cathedral and [[Chancellor]] of the Diocese of Treviso, also holding offices such as spiritual director and [[rector]] of the Treviso seminary, and examiner of the clergy. As Chancellor he made it possible for [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] students to receive religious instruction.

In 1878 Bishop Zanelli died, leaving the Bishopric of [[Treviso]] vacant. Following Zanelli's death, the canons of cathedral chapters (of which Monsignor Sarto was one) inherited the episcopal jurisdiction as corporate body, and were chiefly responsible for the election of a Vicar-Capitular who would take over the responsibilities of Treviso until a new [[bishop]] was named. In 1879, Sarto was elected to the position, which he served in from December of that year to June 1880.

After 1880, Sarto taught [[dogmatic theology]] and [[moral theology]] at the [[seminary]] in Treviso.

=== Cardinal and Patriarch ===
[[Image:Kardin<U+00E1>l Sarto.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Cardinal Sarto]]
[[Pope Leo XIII]] made him a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in a secret [[consistory]] on [[12 June]] [[1893]]. He was named Cardinal-Priest of ''[[San Bernardo alle Terme]]''. Three days after this, Cardinal Sarto was publicly named [[Patriarch of Venice]]. This caused difficulty, however, as the government of the reunified [[Italy]] claimed the right to nominate the Patriarch based on its previous alleged exercise by the [[Emperor of Austria]]. The poor relations between the [[Roman Curia]] and the Italian civil government since the annexation of the [[Papal States]] in 1870 placed additional strain on the appointment. The number of vacant [[Episcopal See|sees]] soon grew to thirty. Sarto was finally permitted to assume the position of Patriarch in 1894.

As Cardinal-Patriarch, Sarto steered clear of political involvement, allocating his time for social works and strengthening parochial banks. However, in his first [[pastoral letter]] to the Venetians, Cardinal Sarto argued that in matters pertaining to the Pope, "There should be no questions, no subtleties, no opposing of personal rights to his rights, but only obedience."

== Papal election ==
{{main|Papal conclave, 1903}}
On [[20 July]] [[1903]], Leo XIII died, and at the end of that month the [[Papal Election|conclave]] convened to elect his successor. According to historians, the favorite was the late Pope's secretary of state, [[Mariano Rampolla|Mariano Cardinal Rampolla del Tindaro]]. On the first ballot, Cardinal Rampolla del Tindaro received 24 votes, Cardinal Gotti had 17 votes, and Cardinal Sarto 5 votes. On the second ballot, Rampolla del Tindaro had gained 5 votes, as did Sarto. The next day, it seemed that Rampolla would be elected. However, the [[veto]] (''[[jus exclusivae]]'') against Rampolla's nomination, by Polish Cardinal [[Jan Maurycy Pawe<U+0142> Cardinal Puzyna de Kosielsko]] from Cracow in the name of Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] (1848<U+2013>1916) of [[Austria-Hungary]], was proclaimed. Many among the conclave, including Rampolla del Tindaro, protested the veto, and it was even suggested that he be elected pope despite the veto.

However, the third vote had already begun, and thus the conclave had to continue with the voting, which resulted in no clear winner, though it did indicate that many of the conclave wished to turn their support to Sarto, who had 21 votes upon counting. The fourth vote showed Rampolla del Tindaro with 30 votes and Sarto with 24. It seemed clear that the cardinals were moving toward Cardinal Sarto.

On the following morning, the fifth vote of the conclave was taken, and the count had Rampolla with 10 votes, Gotti with 2 votes, and Sarto with 50 votes{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}. Thus, on 4 August 1903, Cardinal Sarto was elected to the 257th pontificate. This marked the last time a [[veto]] would be exercised by a Catholic monarch in the proceedings of the conclave.

At first, it is reported, Sarto declined the nomination, feeling unworthy. Additionally, he had been deeply saddened by the use of the Austro-Hungarian [[veto]] and vowed to rescind these powers and [[excommunicate]] anyone who leaked information during a conclave. With the cardinals asking him to reconsider, it is further reported, he went into solitude, and took the position after deep prayer and the urging of his fellow cardinals.

In accepting the papacy, Sarto took as his papal name Pius X, out of respect for his recent predecessors of the same name, particularly [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846<U+2013>78), who had fought against theological liberals and for papal supremacy. Pius X's traditional [[papal coronation|coronation]] took place on the following Sunday, [[9 August]] [[1903]].

[[Image:PiusXvatgarden.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pope Pius X in the Vatican Gardens]]The pontificate of Pius X was noted for its conservative theology and reforms in liturgy and church law.  In what became his motto, the Pope stated in 1903 that his papacy would undertake ''Instaurare Omnia in Christo'', or "to restore all things in [[Christ]]." In his first encyclical (''[[E Supremi Apostolatus]]'', [[4 October]], [[1903]]), he stated that his overriding policy as follows: "We champion the authority of [[God]]. His authority and Commandments should be recognized, deferred to, and respected."
===Church reforms and theology ===
====Restoration in Christ and mariology====
Pius X  promoted daily communion.  In his 1904 encyclical [[Ad Diem Illum]], he views Mary in context of "restoring everything in Christ".  Spiritually we all are her children and she is the mother of us, therefore, she is to be revered like a mother.<ref>Ad diem illum 10</ref>  Christ is  the Word made Flesh and  the Savior of mankind. He had a physical body like  every other man: and as Savior of the human family, he had a spiritual and mystical body,  the Church. This, the Pope argues has consequences for our view of the Blessed Virgin.

She  did not conceive the Eternal Son of God merely that He might be made man taking His human nature from her, but also, by giving him her human nature, that He might be the Redeemer of men. Mary, carrying the Savior within her, also carried all those whose life was contained in the life of the Savior. Therefore all the faithful  united to Christ, are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones<ref>(Ephes. v., 30),</ref>  from the womb of Mary like a body united to its head. Though  a spiritual and mystical fashion, all are  children of Mary, and she is their Mother. Mother, spiritually, but truly Mother of the members of Christ.(S. Aug. L. de S. Virginitate, c. 6).<ref>Ad diem illum laetissimum  10</ref>

====''Tra le sollecitudini'' and Gregorian chant ====

Within three months of his coronation, Pius X published his ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Tra le sollecitudini]]'' (possibly co-written by his friend [[Lorenzo Perosi]]). [[European classical music|Classical]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]] compositions had long been favoured over [[Gregorian chant]] in ecclesiastical music. The Pope announced a return to earlier musical styles, championed by [[Lorenzo Perosi|Don Perosi]]. Since 1898, Perosi had been Director of the [[Sistine Chapel Choir]], a title which Pius X upgraded to "Perpetual Director."  The Pope's choice of [[Joseph Pothier|Dom Joseph Pothier]] to supervise the new editions of chant led to the official adoption of the [[Solesmes Abbey|Solesmes]] edition of Gregorian chant.

==== Liturgical changes ====
In his papacy, Pius X worked to increase devotion in the lives of the [[clergy]] and [[laity]], particularly in the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] (which he reformed considerably - see [[Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]]) and the [[Mass (liturgy)|Holy Mass]].

In addition to restoring to prominence the Gregorian Chant, he placed a renewed [[liturgy|liturgical]] emphasis on the [[Eucharist]], saying, "Holy Communion is the shortest and safest way to Heaven." To this end, he encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion. This extended to children, who had reached the "age of discretion" (about seven years old), as well, though he did not permit a return to the older practice of [[Infant Communion|infant communion]]. In conjunction, he also emphasized frequent recourse to the [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Sacrament of Penance]] in order that Holy Communion would be received worthily. Pius X's devotion to the Eucharist would eventually earn him the honorific of "Pope of the Blessed Sacrament," by which he is still known among his devotees.

==== Anti-modernism ====
Pius X's papacy featured vigorous condemnation of what he termed '[[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|modernists]]' and '[[Relativism|relativists]]' who endangered the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic faith]] (see for example his [[Oath Against Modernism]]). This is perhaps the most controversial aspect of his papacy.

Modernism and relativism, in terms of their presence in the Church, were theological trends that tried to assimilate modern philosophers like [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] as well as rationalism into Catholic theology. Modernists justified this change with the idea that beliefs of the Church have evolved (as opposed to a development of doctrine) throughout its history and all evolution should subject itself in conformity to modern man. Anti-modernists viewed these notions as contrary to the dogmas and traditions of the Catholic Church because it renders all dogma changeable which would contradict their very nature. As a result all Christian beliefs would be thrown into doubt because they are subject to change and evolution. The most brutal results of Modernism would therefore be a slippery slope into deism, agnosticism, and/or atheism.

In a decree, entitled ''[[Lamentabili Sane Exitu]]''<ref>[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius10/p10lamen.htm Lamentabili Sane<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (or "A Lamentable Departure Indeed"), issued [[3 July]] [[1907]], Pius X formally condemned sixty-five modernist or relativist propositions concerning the nature of the Church, [[revelation]], [[biblical exegesis]], the [[sacraments]], and the divinity of [[Christ]]. This was followed by the encyclical ''[[Pascendi Dominici Gregis]]'' (or "Feeding the Lord's Flock"), which characterized Modernism as the "synthesis of all [[heresy|heresies]]." Following these, Pius X ordered that all clerics take the [[Anti-Modernist oath|''Sacrorum antistitum'']], an oath against Modernism. He also encouraged the formation and efforts of ''Sodalitium Pianum'' (or League of Pius V), an anti-Modernist network of informants.

Pius X's aggressive stance against modernism caused some disruption within the Church. Although only about forty clerics refused to take the oath, Catholic scholarship with modernistic tendencies was substantially discouraged. [[Theology|Theologians]] who wished to pursue lines of inquiry in line with secularism, modernism, or relativism had to stop, or face conflict with the papacy, and possibly even [[excommunication]].

====Catechism of Saint Pius X====
{{main|Catechism of Saint Pius X}}
[[Image:PiusXstudy.jpg|left|thumb|320px|Pius X in his study]] 
The Catechism of Pope St. Pius X is his realisation of a simple, plain, brief, popular [[Catechism]] for uniform use throughout the whole world; it was used in the ecclesiastical province of Rome and for some years in other parts of Italy; it was not, however, prescribed for use throughout the universal church.<ref>[http://www.catholicprimer.org/vatican_docs/catechism_st_pp_pius_x.pdf Catechism of Saint Pius X,] p. 3</ref> The characteristics of Pius X were "simplicity of exposition and depth of content. Also because of this, St. Pius X's catechism might have friends in the future."<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-7161?l=english Cardinal Ratzinger on the Abridged Version of Catechism]. In better English translation: "The text ... was characterized by simplicity of exposition and depth of content. That is also a reason why the Catechism of Saint Pius X may still find friends in the future"([http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=775 Interview with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]).</ref> The Catechism was extolled as a method of religious teaching in his encyclical "''Acerbo Nimis''" of April 1905.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_15041905_acerbo-nimis_en.html#top ''Acerbo Nimis'' 1905 text]</ref> 

The Catechism of Saint Pius X was issued in 1908, (in Italian ''Catechismo della dottrina Cristiana, Pubblicato per Ordine del Sommo Pontifice San Pio X'') An English translation runs to more than 115 pages.<ref>[http://www.catholicprimer.org/vatican_docs/catechism_st_pp_pius_x.pdf Catechism of Saint Pius X,] p. 2</ref>

Asked in 2003, whether the almost 100-year-old Catechism of Saint Pius X was still valid, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Ratzinger]] said: "The faith as such is always the same. Hence the Catechism of Saint Pius X always preserves its value. Whereas ways of transmitting the contents of the faith can change instead. And hence one may wonder whether the Catechism of Saint Pius X can in that sense still be considered valid today."<ref>[http://www.30giorni.it/us/articolo.asp?id=775 Interview with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]</ref>

====Reform of Canon Law====
The [[Canon Law]]s of the Catholic Church varied from region to region with no overall prescriptions. On 19 March 1904, Pope Pius X named a commission of Cardinals to draft a universal set of laws to be the Canon law for the twentieth century. Two of his successors worked  in the commission, G. della Chiesa,  to become [[Pope Benedict XV]] and [[Eugenio Pacelli]], to become [[Pope Pius XII]]. The new [[Canon Law]] was decreed after the death of Pius X, by Benedict XV in 1917.

==== Reform of Church administration ====
Pius X reformed the [[Roman Curia]] with the constitution ''Sapienti Consilio'', and specified new rules enforcing a bishop's oversight of seminaries in the encyclical ''Pieni L'Animo''.  He established regional seminaries (closing some smaller ones), and promulgated a new plan of seminary study.  He also barred clergy from administering social organizations.

===Church policies towards secular governments ===

[[Image:MarrydelValpacelli.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cardinal Secretary Merry del Val and Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli at the signing ceremony of the [[Serbian concordat]] underneath the picture of Pius X, 24 June 1914]]
Pius X reversed the accommodating approach of Leo XIII towards secular governments, appointing [[Rafael Merry del Val]] as Cardinal Secretary of State. When the [[President of France|President]] of [[France]] [[<U+00C9>mile Loubet]] visited [[King of Italy|Italian monarch]] [[Victor Emmanuel III]] (1900<U+2013>46), Pius X, still refusing to accept the annexation of the Papal territories by Italy, reproached the French president for this visit and refused to meet him. This led to a diplomatic break with France, and in 1905 France issued a [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|Law of Separation]], which [[Separation of church and state|separated church and state]], and which the Pope denounced. The effect of this separation was the Church<U+2019>s loss of its government funding in France. Eventually, France expelled the [[Jesuits]] and broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican.

The Pope adopted a similar position toward secular governments in other parts of the world: in [[Portugal]], [[Ireland]], [[Poland]], [[Ethiopia]], and a number of other states with large Catholic populations. His actions and statements against international relations with Italy angered the secular powers of these countries, as well as a few others, like [[England]] and [[Russia]].

In 1908 the papal decree ''[[Ne Temere]]'' came into effect which complicated [[interreligious marriage|mixed marriages]].  Marriages not performed by a Roman Catholic priest were declared legal but religiously invalid, worrying some Protestants that the Church would counsel separation for couples married in a Protestant church or by civil service.<ref>[http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1981/Moir.html John S. Moir, "Canadian Protestant Reaction to the Ne Temere Decree"<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Priests were given discretion to refuse to perform mixed marriages or lay conditions upon them, commonly including a requirement that the children be raised Roman Catholic.  The decree proved particularly divisive in [[Ireland]], which has a large [[Protestant]] minority, and contributed indirectly to the subsequent political conflict there.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

As secular authority challenged that of the papacy, Pius X became more aggressive. He suspended the ''[[Opera dei Congressi]]'', which coordinated the work of Catholic associations in Italy, as well as condemning ''[[Le Sillon]]'', a French social movement that tried to reconcile the Church with [[liberalism|liberal]] political views. He also opposed [[trade union]]s that were not exclusively Catholic.

Pius X partially lifted decrees forbidding Italian Catholics from voting; however, he never recognised the Italian government.

====Relations with the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]====
Initially Pius maintained his [[prisoner in the Vatican]] stance but with the rise of [[socialism]] he began to allow the ''[[Non Expedit]]'' to be relaxed. In 1905 in his [[encyclical]] ''[[Il Fermo Proposito]]'' he allowed Catholics to vote when they were <U+2018>''help[ing] the maintenance of social order''<U+2019> by voting for deputies who were not socialist.

====Relations with Poland and Russia====
{{Main|Pope Pius X and Russia}}
Under Pius X, the traditionally difficult situation of Polish Catholics in Russia did not improve. Although Tsar Nicolas issued a decree 22 February 1903, promising religious freedom for the Catholic Church, and, in 1905, promulgated a constitution, which included religious freedom,<ref>Schmidlin III, 125</ref> the Russian Orthodox Church felt threatened and insisted on stiff interpretations. [[Papal]] decrees were not permitted and contacts with the Vatican remained outlawed.

=== Other activities ===
[[Image:PiusXbenedict XV.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pius X consecrates as a Bishop Giacomo Paolo Giovanni Battista della Chiesa, the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], in the Vatican in 1907]]
In addition to the political defense of the Church, liturgical changes, anti-modernism, and the beginning of the codification of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], the papacy of Pius X saw the reorganisation of the [[Roman Curia]]. Also, to update the education of priests, seminaries and their curricula were reformed.

Pius X [[Beatification|beatified]] ten individuals and [[Canonization|canonized]] four. Those beatified during his pontificate, were [[Marie Genevieve Meunier]] (1906), [[Rose Chretien]] (1906), [[Valentin Faustino Berri Ochoa]] (1906), [[Saint Clarus]] (1907), [[Zdislava Berka]] (1907), [[John Bosco]] (1907), [[John van Ruysbroeck]] (1908), [[Andrew Nam Thung]] (1909), [[Agatha Lin]] (1909), [[Agnes De]] (1909), [[Joan of Arc]] (1909), and [[John Eudes]] (1909). Those canonized by him were [[Alexander Sauli]] (1904), [[Gerard Majella]] (1904), [[Clement Mary Hofbauer]] (1909), and [[Joseph Oriol]] (1909).

Pius X published sixteen encyclicals; among them was ''[[Vehementer nos]]'' on [[February 11]], [[1906]], which condemned the [[1905 French law on the separation of the State and the Church]]. Pius X also confirmed, though not infallibly,<ref>[http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2001/0101fr.asp Out On A Limbo]</ref> the existence of [[Limbo]] in Roman Catholic theology in his 1905 [[Catechism#Catholic catechisms|Catechism]], saying that the unbaptized "do not have the joy of God but neither do they suffer... they do not deserve Paradise, but neither do they deserve Hell or [[Purgatory]]."<ref>[http://www.religioustolerance.org/limbo2.htm Past Roman Catholic statements about Limbo and the destination of unbaptised infants who die?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 23 November 1903, Pius X issued a papal directive, a [[motu proprio]], that banned women from singing in church choirs.

In the [[Prophecy of the Popes|Prophecy of St. Malachy]], the collection of 112 prophecies about the Popes, Pius X appears as ''Ignis Ardens'' or "Burning Fire."

== Death and burial ==
[[Image:PiusXAug201914.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pius X at his deathbed]]
In 1913 Pius X suffered a [[heart attack]], and subsequently lived in the shadow of poor health. In 1914, the Pope fell ill on the Feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]] ([[15 August]]), an illness from which he would not recover. His condition was worsened by the events leading to the outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914<U+2013>18), which reportedly sent the 79 year-old Pope into a state of horror and melancholy. He died on [[20 August]][[1914]] of a [[heart attack]], only a few hours after the death of [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit leader]] [[Franz Xavier Wernz]].

Following his death, Pius X was buried in a [[list of papal tombs|simple and unadorned tomb]] in the crypt below [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Papal physicians had been in the habit of removing organs to aid the embalming process. Pius X expressly prohibited this, however, and none of his successors have allowed the practice to be reinstituted.

Although Pius X's canonisation took place in 1954, the events leading up to it began immediately with his death. A letter of [[24 September]] [[1916]] by Monsignor Leo, [[Bishop of Nicotera and Tropea]], referred to Pius X as "a great Saint and a great Pope." To accommodate the large number of pilgrims seeking access to his tomb, in excess of what the crypt would hold, "a small metal cross was set into the floor of the basilica," which read ''Pius Papa X'', "so that the faithful might kneel down directly above the tomb".<ref name="angelusonline.org">[http://www.angelusonline.org/Article304-thread-order1-threshold0.phtml CANONIZATION OF POPE PIUS X BY POPE PIUS XII :: Angelus Online :: The Angelus Magazine Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Masses were held near his tomb until 1930.

Devotion to Pius X between the two [[world war]]s remained high. On [[14 February]] [[1923]], in honor of the 20th anniversary of his accession to the papacy, the first moves toward his [[canonisation]] began with the formal appointment of those who would carry out his cause. The event was marked by the erecting of a monument in his memory in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. On [[19 August]] [[1939]], [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939<U+2013>58) delivered a tribute to Pius X at [[Castel Gandolfo]]. On [[12 February]] [[1943]], a further development of Pius X's cause was achieved, when he was declared to have displayed [[heroic virtue]]s, gaining therefore the title "Venerable".

On [[19 May]] [[1944]], Pius X's coffin was exhumed and was taken to the Chapel of the Holy Crucifix in St. Peter's Basilica for the canonical examination. Upon opening the coffin, the examiners found the body of Pius X remarkably well preserved, despite the fact that he had died 30 years before and had made wishes not to be embalmed. According to Jerome Dai-Gal, "all of the body" of Pius X "was in an excellent state of conservation".<ref name="angelusonline.org"/> After the examination and the end of the apostolic process towards Pius X's cause, Pius XII bestowed the title of [[Venerable]] Servant of God upon Pius X. His body was exposed for 45 days, before being placed back in his tomb.

Following this, the process towards [[beatification]] began, and thus investigations by the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|Sacred Congregation of Rites]] (S.C.R.) into [[miracle]]s performed by intercessory work of Pius X subsequently took place. The S.C.R. would eventually recognize two miracles. The first involved Sr. Marie-Fran<U+00E7>oise Deperras, a nun who had [[bone cancer]] and was cured on [[7 December]] [[1928]] during a [[novena]] in which a relic of Pius X was placed on her chest. The second involved Sr. Benedetta De Maria, who had [[cancer]], and in a novena started in 1938, she eventually touched a relic statue of Pius X and was cured.

[[Pope Pius XII]] officially approved the two miracles on [[11 February]] [[1951]]; and on [[4 March]], Pius XII, in his ''De Tuto'', declared that the Church could proceed in the beatification of the Venerable Pope Pius X. His beatification took place on [[3 June]] [[1951]] at St. Peter's before 23 cardinals, hundreds of bishops and archbishops, and a crowd of 100,000 faithful. During his beatification decree, Pius XII referred to Pius X as "Pope of the Eucharist", in honor of Pius X's expansion of the rite to children.

Following his beatification, on [[17 February]] [[1952]], Pius X's body was transferred from its tomb to the Vatican basilica and placed under the altar of the chapel of the Presentation. The pontiff's body lies within a glass and bronze-work sarcophagus for the faithful to see.

On [[29 May]] [[1954]], less than three years after his beatification, Pius X was canonized, following the S.C.R.'s recognition of two more miracles. The first involved Francesco Belsami, an attorney from [[Naples]] who had a fatal [[pulmonary]] [[abscess]], who was cured upon placing a picture of the Blessed Pope Pius X upon his chest. The second miracle involved Sr. Maria Ludovica Scorcia, a nun who was afflicted with a serious [[Nervous system|neurotropic]] [[virus]], and who, upon several novenas, was entirely cured. The Canonization mass was presided over by Pius XII at Saint Peter's Basilica before a crowd of about 800,000<ref>[http://www.museosanpiox.it/international/eng/engpio_x8.html The Canon Process - Museo San Pio X<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of the faithful and church officials at St. Peter's Basilica. Pius X became the first Pope to be canonized since the 17th century.

Prayer cards often depict the sanctified Pontiff with instruments of [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]]. In addition to being celebrated as the "Pope of the Blessed Sacrament," St. Pius X is also the patron saint of emigrants from Treviso.  He is honored in numerous parishes in Italy, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and the United States.

Pius X's feast day was assigned in 1955 to [[3 September]], to be celebrated as a Double.  It remained thus for 15 years. In the 1960 calendar (incorporated in the 1962 [[Roman Missal]] of [[Pope John XXIII]], whose continued use as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] is authorized under the conditions indicated in the motu proprio ''Summorum Pontificum'') the rank was changed to Third-Class Feast. The rank in the General Roman Calendar since 1969 is that of [[memorial (liturgy)|Memorial]] and the feast day is obligatorily celebrated on [[21 August]], closer to the day of his death ([[20 August]], impeded by the feast day of St Bernard).<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 101 and 137</ref>

== Papal coat of arms ==
[[Image:Pius X COA.svg|thumb|right|200px|Coat of arms of Pius X]]
The [[Papal Coat of Arms|papal arms]] of Pius X are composed of the traditional elements of all papal [[heraldry]] prior to [[Pope Benedict XVI]]: the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], the [[papal tiara]], and the [[Papal regalia and insignia|keys]]. The tiara and keys are typical symbols used in the [[coats of arms]] of pontiffs, which symbolize their authority.

The shield of Pius X's coat of arms is charged in two basic parts, as it is ''per fess''. In chief (the top part of the shield) shows the arms of the Patriarch of Venice, which Pius X was from 1893&ndash;1903. It consists of the lion of [[St. Mark]] proper and haloed in silver upon a silver-white background, displaying a book with the inscription of PAX TIBI MARCE, which refers to the motto of Venice ''Pax tibi Marce, Evangelista meus'', which is Latin for ''Peace to you, Mark my evangelist''. This motto refers to Venice as the final resting place of Saint Mark. Renditions of this part of Pius X's arms depict the lion either with or without a sword, and sometimes only one side of the book is written on.

The shield displays the arms Pius X took as [[Bishop of Mantua]]: an anchor proper cast into a stormy sea (the blue and silver wavy lines), lit up by a single six-pointed star of gold. These were inspired by ''[[Book of Hebrews|Hebrews]]'' 6:19, which states that the hope we have is the sure and steadfast anchor of the soul. Pius X, then Bishop Sarto, stated that "hope is the sole companion of my life, the greatest support in uncertainty, the strongest power in situations of weakness."

Although not present upon his arms, the only motto attributed to Pope Pius X is the one for which he is best remembered: ''instaurare omnia in Christo'' (Latin for "To restore all things in Christ"). These words were the last he spoke before he died.
