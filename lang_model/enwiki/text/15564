'''Mary Carpenter''' (3 April 1807 &ndash; 14 June 1877) was an [[English people|English]] educational and [[social reformer]]. The daughter of a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], she founded a [[ragged school]] and [[Reformatory|reformatories]], bringing previously unavailable educational opportunities to poor children and young offenders in [[Bristol]].

She published articles and books on her work and her lobbying was instrumental in the passage of several educational acts in the mid-nineteenth century. She was the first woman to have a paper published by the [[Statistical Society of London]]. [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lv_wAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP9&dq=mary+carpenter+statistical+society&hl=en&ei=KPehTP2WCMuK4gbg6a2HAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=mary%20carpenter%20statistical%20society&f=false]. She addressed many conferences and meetings and became known as one of the foremost public speakers of her time. Carpenter was active in the [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery movement]]; she also visited [[India]], visiting schools and prisons and working to improve [[female education]], establish reformatory schools and improve prison conditions. In later years she visited Europe and America, carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform.

Carpenter publicly supported [[women's suffrage]] in her later years and also campaigned for female access to higher education. She is buried in [[Arnos Vale Cemetery]] in Bristol.

==Early life==
Carpenter was born in 1807, in [[Exeter]], the first child of [[Lant Carpenter|Doctor Lant Carpenter]], a Unitarian minister in [[Exeter]], and Anna (or Hannah) Penn. In 1817 the family moved to Bristol, where her father took charge of the [[Lewin's Mead Unitarian meeting house]]. Doctor Carpenter established a boarding school at Great George Street, [[Brandon Hill, Bristol|Brandon Hill]], which was run by his wife and daughters,<ref name="manton">{{cite book|last=Manton|first=Jo|title=Mary Carpenter and the Children of the Streets|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|year=1976|pages=25<U+2013>27|isbn=0-435-32569-8|accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref><ref>

In 1833 she met [[Ram Mohan Roy]], a founder of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] movement which reformed social [[Hinduism]], and was influenced by his philosophy during his short stay with Miss Castle and Miss Kiddel at Beech House in [[Stapleton, Bristol|Stapleton]]<ref>{{cite web

==Social work and anti-slavery==
In 1835 she helped organise a "Working and Visiting Society", in the slums around Lewin's Mead, of which she remained secretary for nearly twenty years.

==Reformatories==

[[File:Redlodge2.JPG|200px|thumb|right|The Red Lodge, Bristol, where Mary Carpenter established a reformatory school in 1851.]]

This was followed in 1851 by the publication of ''Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes, and for Juvenile Offenders''. She sketched out three classes of schools as urgently needed;  good free day schools (for the children in the general population),  feeding industrial schools (for children in need) and reformatory schools (for young offenders).<ref name="carpenter-reformatory">{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Mary|title=Reformatory Schools: For the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes and for Juvenile Offenders|publisher=C.

In 1852 she put her ideas into practice, establishing a reformatory school at Bristol in 1852, in [[Kingswood, Bristol|Kingswood]] in the premises of a school which had originally been set by [[John Wesley]].<ref name="infed-smith" /> Originally this was for boys and girls, but she soon decided to separate the sexes and set up a girls' reformatory in what is now the [[Red Lodge Museum, Bristol|Red Lodge Museum]] in 1854, initially funded by [[Anne Isabella Byron, Baroness Byron|Lady Byron]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The "Canynge" concise guide to Bristol and Suburbs|publisher=Jeffries & Sons|location=Bristol|year=1878|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/canyngeconcisegu00brisiala}}</ref>  Her strong religious beliefs drove her reforms. "Love must be the ruling sentiment of all who attempt to influence and guide these children", she wrote in ''Reformatory Schools for the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes, and for Juvenile Offenders''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Mary|title=Reformatory Schools: For the Children of the Perishing and Dangerous Classes and for Juvenile Offenders|year=1851|publisher=C. Gilpin|pages=74|url=http://books.google.com/?id=smjRfTXcTV0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Mary+Carpenter%22 }}</ref> Now that the principle of reformatory schools was established, Carpenter agitated for free day schools, arguing the ragged schools were entitled to financial aid from the government. At the Oxford meeting of the [[British Association]] (1860) she read a paper on this subject, and, mainly owing to her instigation, a conference on ragged schools in relation to government grants for education was held at Birmingham  in 1861.<ref name="cyc" />

In the same year, Carpenter was invited to give evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee on the Education of Destitute Children. Amongst other evidence she criticised Catholic priests who warned young children of Irish immigrants from attending her ragged school. She condemned the "low Anglo Irish" as combining "the vices of the English in a large commercial town with their&nbsp;... natural character in a very undesirable way."<ref name="dresser">{{cite book |author=Fleming, Peter; Dresser, Madge |title=Bristol: Ethnic Minorities and the City, 1000-2001 (England's Past for Everyone) |publisher=Phillimore & Co Ltd |location=Chichester |year=2007 |pages=119 |isbn=1-86077-477-6}}</ref>

She further said, "I can only say that the children told us that the priests had in one case flogged a child for coming to our school, and had used very strong influence to prevent them from coming, and that I have myself been absolutely insulted in the street by Catholic children&nbsp;... who feel erroneously that they were showing their zeal for their own religion by insulting Protestants."<ref name="dresser2" >

==India==
In 1866 Carpenter visited [[India]], which had been an ambition of hers since her meeting with Raja Ram Mohan Roy in 1833. She visited [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]], finding that for the most part girls were not educated past the age of twelve years, mainly due to a lack of educated female teachers.  During her visit Carpenter met [[Keshab Chandra Sen]], the leader of Brahmo Samaj. Sen asked her to form an organisation in Britain to improve communication between British and Indian reformers, which she did in 1870, establishing the National Indian Association.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martel|first=Carol M|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|editor=Olson, James Stuart; Sadle, Robert|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|pages=783<U+2013>784|isbn=978-0-313-29367-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-YwDfm1pFF8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=national+indian+association+mary+carpenter|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> She visited many schools, hospitals and gaols and encouraged both Indian and British colonial administrators to improve and fund these.

==Legacy==
The reformatory school in Kingswood was active until 1984 and the Red Lodge Girls' Reformatory closed in 1918.<ref name="infed-smith"/> Carpenter's campaigns for juvenile penal reform had a major influence on the development of a more enlightened regime for dealing with young offenders.  Her writings, political activism and public addresses had a major influence on correctional education in Britain, Europe, India and America and helped bring about major reforms in the 19th and 20th century.<ref name="gehring4" >{{cite journal|last=Gehring|first=Thom|coauthors=Bowers, Fredalene B|date=September 2003|title=Mary Carpenter: 19th Century English correctional education hero|journal=Journal of Correctional Education |publisher=Correctional Education Association|pages=2|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4111/is_200309/ai_n9292151/pg_4/?tag=content;col1|accessdate=17 April 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> However, many of the causes of youth crime apparently remain unaddressed in the early 21st century<ref name="manton-22">{{cite book|last=Manton|first=Jo|title=Mary Carpenter and the Children of the Streets|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|year=1976|pages=250<U+2013>251|isbn=0-435-32569-8|accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref> and failures in contemporary youth jails have been criticised by official bodies.<ref>
