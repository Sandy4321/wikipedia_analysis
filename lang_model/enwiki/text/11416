'''Trireme''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] '''<U+03A4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03AE><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03C2>''' pl. ('''<U+03A4><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03AE><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03C2>''' sing.)) refers to a class of warships used by the ancient civilizations of the [[Mediterranean]], especially the [[Phoenicians]], [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. In English, no differentiation is made between the Greek ''tri<U+0113>r<U+0113>s'' and the Latin ''triremes''. This is sometimes a source of confusion, as in other languages these terms refer to different styles of ships. 

The early type had three rows of oars on each side, manned with one man per oar. They originated with the [[Phoenicia]]ns and are best known from the fleets of [[Hellenic civilization|Ancient Greece]]. The early trireme was a development of the ''[[Galley#Penteconters|penteconter]]'', an ancient warship with a single row of 25 oars on each side, and of the ''bireme'' ({{lang-el|<U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03AE><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03C2>}}), a warship with two banks of oars. The trireme's staggered seating permitted three benches per vertical section with an oarsman on each. The [[outrigger]] above the [[gunwale]], projecting laterally beyond it, kept the third row of oars on deck out of the way of the first two under deck. Early triremes were the dominant [[warship]] in the [[Mediterranean]] from the [[7th century BC|7th]] to the [[4th century BC]].

The Greek/Phoenician trireme was the mainstay of most navies until the arrival of the [[quinquireme]]s/[[quinquireme|pentere]]s. Like the triremes, all rowers were now protected under deck and battle was mainly fought by marines. 

Light Roman triremes supplanted the [[liburnian]]s in the late [[Roman navy]]. They were like the early triremes a light type of warship, but with 150 rowers under deck instead of 170, with little armor, but significantly more marines and less structural support for ramming. Later it developed into the heavier medieval [[dromon]].

== History ==
=== Origin ===

The exact origin of the trireme is uncertain and debated, as our evidence comes from literary sources and depictions in reliefs and pottery fragments, which are open to misinterpretations. Depictions of two-tiered ships (biremes), with or without the ''parexeiresia'' (the [[outrigger]], see below), are common in [[8th century BC|8th century]] vases and pottery fragments, and it is at the end of that century that the first references to three-tiered ships are found. According to [[Thucydides]], the trireme was ''introduced to'' Greece by the [[Corinth]]ians in the late [[8th century BC]], and that the Corinthian Ameinocles built four such ships for the [[Samos|Samians]].<ref>Thucydides I.13.2-5</ref> Although this was interpreted by later writers, like [[Pliny]] and [[Diodorus]], to mean that triremes were ''invented'' in Corinth,<ref>Diodorus, ''Bibliotheca historica'', XIV.42.3</ref>, it is likely that the earliest three-tiered warships originated in [[Phoenicia]]. Fragments from an 8th century relief at the [[Assyria]]n capital of [[Nineveh]] depicting the fleets of [[Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] have been interpreted as depicting two- and three-level warships, fitted with [[ramming|rams]]. The 2nd century Christian scholar [[Clement of Alexandria]], drawing on earlier works, explicitly attributes the invention of the trireme to the Sidonians.<ref>''[[Stromata]]'', I.16.36</ref> 

=== Early use and development ===
[[Image:ACMA Relief Lenormant.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Lenorman Relief, from the [[Athenian Acropolis]], depicting the rowers of an ''aphract'' Athenian trireme, ca. 410 BC. Found in 1852, it is one of the main pictorial evidences on the layout of the trireme.]]
[[Herodotus]] mentions that the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] pharaoh [[Necho]] ([[610 BC|610]]&ndash;[[595 BC]]) built triremes on the [[Nile]], for service in the Mediterranean, and in the [[Red Sea]], but this reference is disputed by modern historians, and attributed to a confusion, since "tri<U+0113>res" was by the 5th century used in the sense of "warship", regardless its type.<ref>The Age of the Galley, p. 45-46</ref> The first definite reference to the use of triremes in naval combat dates to ca. [[525 BC]], when, according to [[Herodotus]], the [[tyrant]] [[Polycrates]] of [[Samos Island|Samos]] was able to contribute 40 triremes to a [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of [[Egypt]].<ref>Herodotus, III.44</ref> Thucydides meanwhile clearly states that until the time of the [[Persian Wars|Persian invasions]], the majority of the Greek navies consisted of (probably two-tiered) penteconters and ''ploia makr<U+00E1>'' ("long ships").<ref>Thucydides I.14.1-3</ref> 

In any case, by the early 5th century, the trireme was becoming the dominant warship type of the eastern Mediterranean, with minor differences between the "Greek" and "Phoenician" types, as literary references and depictions of the ships on coins make clear. The first large-scale naval battle where triremes participated was the [[Battle of Lade]] during the [[Ionian Revolt]], where the combined fleets of the Greek [[Ionia]]n cities were defeated by the Persian fleet, composed of squadrons from their Phoenician, [[Caria]]n, [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] and Egyptian subjects.

=== Persian and Peloponnesian Wars ===

Partly as a result of Athenian support to the Ionian Greeks, the Persian Great King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] started moving against metropolitan Greece. The Persian fleet roamed the Aegean Sea unopposed, but the first invasion force was defeated at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in [[490 BC]]. The second invasion, under [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], included a massive land army and a large navy, which were to cooperate closely. 

Athens was at that time embroiled in a conflict with the neighbouring island of [[Aegina]], which possessed a formidable navy. In order to counter this, and possibly with an eye already at the mounting Persian preparations, in [[482 BC]] the Athenian statesman [[Themistocles]] used his political skills and influence to persuade the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Athenian assembly]] to start the construction of 200 triremes, using the income of the newly discovered silver mines at [[Lavrion]]. The first clash with the Persian navy was at the [[Battle of Artemisium]], where both sides suffered great casualties. However, the decisive naval clash occurred at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], where Xerxes' invasion fleet was decisively defeated.

After Salamis and another Greek victory over the Persian fleet at [[Battle of Mycale|Mycale]], the Ionian cities were freed, and the [[Delian League]] was formed under the aegis of Athens. Gradually, the predominance of Athens turned the League effectively into an Athenian Empire. The source and foundation of Athens' power was her strong fleet, composed of over 200 triremes. It not only secured control of the Aegean Sea and the loyalty of her allies, but also safeguarded the trade routes and the grain shipments from the Black Sea, which fed the city's burgeoning population. In addition, as it provided permanent employment for the city's poorer citizens, the fleet played an important role in both maintaining and promoting the radical [[Athenian democracy|Athenian form of democracy]]. Athenian maritime power is the first example of [[thalassocracy]] in world history. Aside from Athens, other major naval powers of the era included [[Syracuse]], [[Corfu]] and [[Corinth]].

In the subsequent [[Peloponnesian War]], naval actions fought by triremes featured prominently, and despite numerous land engagements, Athens was finally defeated through the destruction of her fleet during the [[Sicilian Expedition]] and finally, at the [[Battle of Aegospotami]], at the hands of [[Sparta]] and her allies.

== Construction ==
Because the triremes had positive [[buoyancy]], no remains of the ship have been found.<ref>The Age of the Galley, p. 62</ref> Hence, the only information we have concerning the trireme's construction comes from written sources and indirect archaeological evidence. Most of it concerns the "classical" type of the 5th century, especially as used by Athens. Valuable further information was provided by the trireme reconstruction project (see below).

=== Dimensions ===

Excavations of the ship sheds (''neosoikoi'') at the harbour of Zea in [[Piraeus]], which was the main war harbour of ancient Athens, were carried out by Dragatzis and Wilhelm D<U+00F6>rpfeld in 1885. They provided us a with general outline of the Athenian trireme. It was about 36 meters in length, and just 6 m at its widest. The height of the sheds' interior was established as 4,026 m, leading to estimates that the height of the hull above the water surface was ca. 2,15 m. Its draught was relatively shallow, about 1 m, which, in addition to the relatively flat keel, allowed it to be beached easily. 

=== Propulsion ===
The ship's primary propulsion came from the ca. 170 oars. At tests conducted with the reconstructed ''Olympias'', a steady speed of 4 knots could be maintained, with half the crew resting at a time. The ship also had two masts, a main (''istos megas'') and a small foremast (''istos akateios''), with square sails, while steering was provided by two paddles at the bow. 

== Crew ==
[[Image:Trireme cut fr.png|thumb|300px|right|Depiction of the position and angle of the rowers in a trireme. The form of the ''parexeiresia'', projecting from the deck, is clearly visible.]]
The total crew (''pl<U+0113>r<U+014D>ma'') of the ship was about 200. They were divided as follows:
* The ships captain, the [[trierarch]] (''tri<U+0113>rarchos''). He was a wealthy Athenian citizen (usually from the class of the ''[[pentacosiomedimni|pentakosiomedimoi]]''), responsible for manning and maintaining the ship for a year, which otherwise belonged to the state. The ''tri<U+0113>rarchia'' was one of the [[liturgies]] of ancient Athens, and although it afforded great prestige, it constituted a great financial burden, so that in the fourth century, it was often shared by two citizens, and in 347 BC to special boards.
* The command crew, headed by the helmsman  the ''kybern<U+0113>t<U+0113>s'', who was always an experienced seaman and often the actual commander of the vessel. Other officers were the bow lookout (''pr<U+014D>reus'' or ''pr<U+014D>rat<U+0113>s''), the boatswain (''keleust<U+0113>s''), the quartermaster (''pent<U+0113>kontarchos''), the shipwright (''naup<U+0113>gos''), the piper (''aul<U+0113>t<U+0113>s'') who gave the rowers' rhythm and 2 ''toicharchoi'', in charge of the rowers on each side of the ship. 
* 17 sailors handling the masts and the sails.
* 170-174 rowers (''eretai''), selected from the poorer strata of Athenian society (the ''[[Thetes|th<U+0113>tai]]'') divided according to their positions into:
** 62 ''thranitai'' in the top row (''thranos'' means "deck").
** 54-58 ''zygitai'' in the middle row, named after the beams (''zygoi'') on which they sat.
** 54 ''thalamitai'' or ''thalamioi'' in the lowest row, (''thalamos'' means "hold").
* a varying number of marines (''epibatai''), usually 10-20, for boarding actions.<ref>At the [[Battle of Salamis]], each Athenian ship was recorded to have 14 hoplites and 4 archers on board. ([[Plutarch]], ''Parallel Lives'' Themistocles XIV</ref>

== Tactics ==
In the ancient world, naval combat relied on two methods: [[ramming]] and [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]]. Rams (''embolon'') were fitted to the prows of warships, and were used to rupture the hull of the enemy ship. The preferred method of attack was to come in from astern and behind, with the aim not of creating a single hole, but of rupturing as big a length of the enemy vessel as possible. The minimum speed necessary for a successful impact was about 10 [[Knot (speed)|knot]]s. Another method was to brush alongside the enemy ship, with oars drawn in, in order to break the enemy's oars and render the ship immobile, to be finished off with ease. Unlike later eras, boarding actions were not very frequent with the triremes. Their small size allowed for a limited number of [[Marine (military)|marine]]s to be carried aboard, and during the 5th  and 4th centuries, emphasis was laid on maneuverability and speed, not on armor and firing power, although fleets less confident of their ability in ramming were prone to load more marines onto their ships. In any case, prior to engagement, the masts and railings of the ship were taken down, hindering any attempt at using [[grappling hook]]s. The Athenians especially became masters in the art of ramming, using light, un-[[Deck (ship)|decked]] (''aphraktai'') triremes. 

[[Squadron]]s of triremes employed a variety of tactics. The ''periplous'' ([[Ancient Greek|Gk.]], "sailing around") involved outflanking or encircling the enemy so as to attack them in the vulnerable rear; the ''diekplous'' (Gk., "Sailing out through") involved a concentrated charge so as to break a hole in the enemy line, allowing galleys to break through and then wheel to attack the enemy line from behind; and the ''kyklos'' (Gk., "circle") and the ''m<U+0113>noeid<U+0113>s kyklos'' (Gk. "half-circle"), were defensive tactics to be employed against these maneuvers. In all of these maneuvers, the ability to accelerate faster, row faster, and turn more sharply than one's enemy was very important.

==Changes of engagement and construction==
During the [[Hellenistic period]], the light trireme was supplanted by larger warships in dominant navies, especially the pentere/[[quinquereme]]. The maximum practical number of oar banks a ship could have was three. So the numbers did not refer to the banks of oars anymore (for biremes, triremes and quinquiremes), but to the number of rowers per vertical section, with several men on each oar. The reasons for this development was the increasing use of armor on the bows of warships against ramming attacks, which again required heavier ships for a successful attack. This increased the number of rowers per ship, and also made it possible to use less well-trained personnel for moving these new ships to the minimum impact speed of 10 knots. This change was accompanied by an increased reliance on tactics like [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]], missile skirmishes and using warships as platforms for [[artillery]].

Triremes continued to be the mainstay of all smaller navies. While the Hellenistic kingdoms did develop the [[quinquireme]], most navies of the Greek homeland and the smaller colonies could only afford triremes. It was used by the [[Diadochi]] Empires and sea powers like [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], [[Carthage]] and later [[Rome]]. The difference to the classical 5th century Athenian ships was that they were armored against ramming and carried significantly more marines. Lightened versions of the trireme and smaller vessels were often used as auxiliaries, and still performed quite effectively against the heavier ships, thanks to their greater maneuverability. 

With the rise of [[Rome]] the biggest fleet of [[quinquireme]]s temporarily ruled the [[Mediterranean]], but during the civil wars after Caesar's death the fleet was on the wrong side and a new warfare with light [[liburnian]]s was developed. By Imperial times the fleet was relatively small and had mostly political influence, controlling the grain supply and fighting pirates, who usually employed light biremes and liburnians. But instead of the successful liburnians of the civil war, it was again centered around light triremes, but still with many marines. Out of this type of ship the [[dromon]] developed.

==Reconstruction==
{{main|Olympias (trireme)}}
[[Image:trireme_Olympias.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Olympias (trireme)|Reconstruction of the ''Olympias'']].]]
In 1985&ndash;1987 a shipbuilder in [[Piraeus]], financed by Frank Welsh (a Suffolk banker, writer and trireme enthusiast), advised by historian [[J. S. Morrison]] and naval architect John F. Coates (who with Welsh founded the Trireme Trust that initiated and managed the project), and informed by evidence from underwater archaeology, built a reconstructed Athenian trireme, ''[[Olympias (trireme)|Olympias]]''.

Crewed by 170 volunteer oarsmen and oarswomen, ''Olympias'' in 1988 achieved 9&nbsp;knots (17&nbsp;km/h). These results, achieved with inexperienced crew, suggest that the ancient writers were not exaggerating about straight-line performance.  In addition, ''Olympias'' was able to execute a 180-degree turn in one minute and in an arc no wider than two and one half (2.5) ship-lengths. <!-- see discussion page for issues about maneuverability --> Additional sea trials took place in 1987, 1990, 1992 and 1994. In [[2004]] ''Olympias'' was used ceremonially to transport the [[Olympic Flame]] from the port of Keratsini to the main port of [[Piraeus]] as the [[2004 Olympic Torch Relay]] entered its final stages in the run-up to the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]].

The builders of the reconstruction project considered that it effectively proved conclusively what had previously been in doubt, that Athenian triremes were arranged with the crew positioned in a staggered arrangement on three levels with one person per oar. This would have made optimum use of the available internal dimensions. However since modern humans are on average approximately 6 cm (2 inches) taller than Ancient Greeks (and the same relative dimensions can be presumed for oarsmen and other athletes), the construction of a craft which followed the precise dimensions of the ancient vessel led to cramped rowing conditions and consequent restrictions on the modern crew's ability to propel the vessel with full efficiency, which perhaps explains why the ancient speed records stand unbroken.
