The '''Kingdom of the Gepids''' or '''Gepidia''' was a kingdom established by the [[Gepids]] in the [[Carpathian Basin]].

==History==
In 453, the Gepids and other people allied to defeat Attila's horde of would-be successors, who were dividing up the subjugated peoples like cattle, and led by Ardaric, they broke the Hunnic power in the [[Battle of Nedao|Battle at the River Nedao]] in 454. After the victory they finally won a place to settle in the Carpathian Mountains.
<blockquote>
The Gepidae by their own might won for themselves the territory of the Huns and ruled as victors over the extent of all Dacia, demanding of the Roman Empire nothing more than peace and an annual gift as a pledge of their friendly alliance. This the Emperor freely granted at the time, and to this day that race receives its customary gifts from the Roman Emperor. (Jordanes, l.262)</blockquote>

Not long after the battle at the Nedao the old rivalry between the Gepids and the [[Ostrogoths]] spurred up again and they were driven out of their homeland in 504 by [[Theodoric the Great]].
===Collapse===
They reached the zenith of their power after 537, settling in the rich area around [[Singidunum]] (today [[Belgrade]]). For a short time, the city of [[Sirmium]] (today [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was the center of the Gepid State and the king [[Cunimund]] minted golden coins in it.<ref>http://www.dekanski.com/AD/Mitrovica/CivitasStDemetrii.htm</ref> In 546 the [[Byzantine Empire]] allied themselves with the [[Lombards]] to expel the Gepids from this region.  In 552 the Gepids suffered a disastrous defeat from [[Alboin]] in the [[Battle of Asfeld]] and were finally conquered by the [[Lombards]] in 567. 

Alboin had a drinking-cup made from the skull of Cunimund, which occasioned his death later in Italy, at the hands of an assassin sent by [[Rosamund_(Gepid)|Rosamund]], Cunimond's daughter.<ref>The episode is told in [[Procopius]], in [[Paulus Diaconus]] and in [[Andreas Agnellus]]</ref>

Many Gepids followed Alboin to Italy (see [[Paul the Deacon|Paulus Diaconus]]), but many remained. In 630, [[Theophylact Simocatta]] reported that the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Army entered the territory of the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and attacked a Gepid feast, capturing 30,000 Gepids (they met no Avars). Recent excavation by the [[Tisza]] River at [[Szolnok]] brought up a Gepid nobleman from an Avar period grave who was also wearing Turkic-Avar pieces next to the traditional Germanic clothes in which he was buried.
