==Description==
[[Image:Euthalia_lepidea_ctb.jpg|thumb|left]]Upperside dark brown, paler in the female, with very obscure black markings of transverse lines across the cells of both fore and hind wings and an oblique discal fascia on the fore wing; an ash-grey continuous band along the termen of both fore and hind wings, gradually broadening from the apex of the fore, where it is very narrow, to the tornus of the hind wing, where it covers about one-third oil the wing. In the female this band is outwardly narrowly bordered with brown. Cilia white. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown above; beneath, the antennae ochraceous, the rest dusky white washed with ochraceous. Underside:  Male ochraceous brown, female bright ochraeeous. In both sexes the colours paler on the hind wing; the fore wing somewhat narrowly, the hind wing much more broadly suffused with lilacine-grey on the terminal margins and along the dorsal margin of the hind wing; cells of both wings with dark brown sinuous transverse lines and looplike markings ; both fore and hind wings crossed by somewhat diffuse broad discal and narrower postdiscal dark bands, prominent on the fore, obscure on the hind wing. Male with a patch of specialized dark scales above vein 4 on the upperside of the hind wing.<ref name="bingham">Bingham, C. T. 1905. Fauna of British India. Butterflies. Volume 1</ref>
