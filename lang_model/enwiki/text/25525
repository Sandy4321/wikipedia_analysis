'''Sir Robert Dudley''' (7&nbsp;August 1574 &ndash; 6&nbsp;September 1649) was an [[England|English]] [[explorer]] and cartographer. In 1594, he led an expedition to the [[West Indies]], of which he wrote an account. The illegitimate son of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], he inherited the bulk of the Earl's estate in accordance with his father's will, including [[Kenilworth Castle]]. In 1603&ndash;1605 he tried unsuccessfully to establish his legitimacy in court. After that he left [[England]] forever, finding a new existence in the service of the [[grand duke]]s of [[Tuscany]]. There he worked as an engineer and shipbuilder and designed and published ''[[Dell'Arcano del Mare]]'', the first maritime [[atlas]] to cover the whole world. He was also a skilled [[navigator]] and mathematician. In Italy he styled himself "Earl of Warwick and Leicester", as well as "Duke of Northumberland", a title recognized by the [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand II]].

==Early life==
Robert Dudley was the son of the [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Earl of Leicester]] and his lover [[Lady Douglas Sheffield]], daughter of [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham]]. He grew up in the houses of his father and his father's friends, but had leave to see his mother whenever she wished.<ref>Adams 2008a; Adams 2008b</ref> Lady Sheffield married Sir [[Edward Stafford (diplomat)|Edward Stafford]] in November 1579, and left for the Continent. Leicester was fond of his son and often made trips to see him.<ref>Warner 1899 p. vi; Wilson 1981 p. 246</ref> Dudley was given an excellent education and enrolled into [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1587 with the status of ''filius comitis'', Earl's son. There his mentor was [[Thomas Chaloner (naturalist)|Thomas Chaloner]], who also became his close friend.<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 246</ref> In 1588, when the [[Spanish Armada]] threatened England, the 14-year-old Robert joined his father, who was commanding the army at [[Tilbury|Camp Tilbury]], preparing to resist a Spanish invasion. On 4 September the Earl of Leicester died.<ref>Warner 1899 p. viii</ref> The Earl's will gave Dudley a large inheritance, including the castle and estate at [[Kenilworth]] and the lordships of [[Denbigh]] and [[Chirk]], on the death of his uncle, [[Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick]].<ref>Wilson 1981 pp. 336&ndash;337</ref>

In early 1591, Dudley made a formal contract to marry Frances Vavasour with the consent of [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]], who liked Dudley very much but wished him to wait until he was older. Frances married someone else secretly later that year and was banished from court. In turn, the 17-year-old Dudley married Margaret Cavendish, sister of Sir [[Thomas Cavendish]]&mdash;in whose last voyage he had probably invested. Dudley was excluded from court for this secret marriage, but only for a few days. His father-in-law, Robert Cavendish, gave Margaret two ships, the ''Leicester'' and the ''Roebuck''. She soon died without having children.

==Expedition to the West Indies==
In 1594, Dudley assembled a fleet of ships, including his flagship the [[galleon]] ''Beare'', the ''Beare's Whelpe'' and the [[Full rigged pinnace|pinnace]]s ''Earwig'' and ''Frisking''. He intended to use them to harass the Spaniards in the Atlantic. The Queen did not approve of his plans because of his inexperience and the value of the ships. She did commission him as a general but insisted that he sail to [[Guyana|Guiana]] instead.

Dudley recruited 275 veteran sailors, including the navigator Abraham Kendal, and the captains Thomas Jobson and Benjamin Wood. Dudley's fleet sailed on 6 November 1594, but a sudden storm separated the ships and drove the vessels back to different ports. He sent word to the captain of the ''Beare's Whelp'' to join him in the [[Canary Islands]] or Cabo Blanco and sailed again. At first Dudley's trip proved unlucky&mdash;the ''Earwig'' sank and most of the vessels they encountered were friendly. Dudley led only one raid in the Gulf of Lagos. In December the expedition finally managed to capture two Spanish ships at [[Tenerife]]. Dudley renamed them ''Intent'' and ''Regard'', manned them with his sailors and put Captain Woods in charge. He sailed to Cabo Blanco, expecting to meet the ''Beare's Whelpe'' there, but it did not show up. Dudley's fleet sailed to [[Trinidad]] and anchored at Cedros Bay on 31 January 1595. There he discovered an island that he claimed for the English crown and named ''Dudleiana''. Then he sailed to Paracoa Bay for repairs and made a reconnaissance to San Jose de Oruna but decided not to attack it. Dudley divided his forces, sending the ''Intent'' and ''Regard'' to the north. In Trinidad Dudley recruited a Spanish-speaking Indian who promised to escort an expedition to a gold mine up the [[Orinoco River]]. The expedition led by Captain Jobson returned after two weeks&mdash;as it turned out, their guide had deserted them and they had struggled back. Dudley returned to Trinidad.

On 12 March Dudley's fleet sailed north, where they finally captured a Spanish merchantman. Then it sailed to Cabo Rojo, [[Puerto Rico]], waited for suitable prey for some time and then sailed towards [[Bermuda]]. A storm blew the ''Beare'' north to near what is now New England before the fleet finally reached the [[Azores]]. Low on provisions and working guns, Dudley sailed for home but met a Spanish [[man-of-war]] on the way. Dudley managed to outmanoeuvre and cripple it in a two-day battle but decided not to board it. The ''Beare'' arrived at [[St. Ives, Cornwall]] at the end of May 1595 and Dudley heard that Captain Woods had taken three ships.

The next year, 1595, Dudley joined [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] to serve as a commander of the ''Nonpareil'' in the expedition against [[Cadiz]]. He was later knighted for his conduct in that battle although what he did was not recorded. Shortly afterwards he married Alice Leigh, daughter of [[Sir Thomas Leigh]].
In 1597 Dudley sent Captain Woods to China with the ''Beare'' and ''Beare's Whelp'', but they never returned.

==Claiming legitimacy==
In May 1603 Dudley was apparently told by a shadowy adventurer called Thomas Drury that his parents had been secretly married.<ref>Warner 1899 p. xli</ref> He began trying to establish his claim to the titles of [[Earl of Leicester]] and [[Earl of Warwick]], as well as to inherit his deceased uncle [[Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick|Ambrose Dudley's]] estate of [[Warwick Castle]]. The case came before the [[Star Chamber]] in 1604&ndash;1605 and aroused great public interest. 90 witnesses for Dudley and 57 for the widowed Countess of Leicester, [[Lettice Knollys]], appeared. Dudley won, and possibly pressured, his mother to support his cause, so she declared in writing (she did not attend the trial personally) that Leicester had solemnly contracted to marry her in Cannon Row, [[Westminster]] in 1571, and that they were married at [[Esher]], [[Surrey]], "in wintertime" in 1573. Yet all of the ten putative witnesses ("besides others") to the ceremony were long dead since. Neither could she remember who the "minister" was, nor the exact date of the marriage.<ref>Warner 1899 pp. xl&ndash;xli; Adams 2008b</ref> The Star Chamber rejected the evidence and fined several of the witnesses. It was concluded that Sir Robert Dudley had been duped by Thomas Drury, who in his turn had sought "his own private gains".<ref>Warner 1899 p. xlvi</ref> [[James I (England)|King James]] ratified the judgement and it was handed down on 10 May 1605. In 1621 an official investigation in [[Tuscany]], Dudley's new country, concluded that Dudley's "friends maintain that his father married Lady Sheffield, but they are unable to account for her marriage during his lifetime, an act so injurious to the alleged legitimacy of her son."<ref>Adams 2008a</ref>{{#tag:ref|In the nineteenth century, the question of Sir Robert Dudley's legitimacy was again raised in the [[House of Lords]], but again, it remained unresolved. Historians have had differing views on the problem: While Derek believes in a marriage,<ref>Wilson 1981 p. 326</ref> it has been rejected by, for example, Conyers Read,<ref>Read 1936 p. 23</ref> Johanna Rickman,<ref>Rickman 2008 p. 51</ref> and Simon Adams.<ref>Adams 2008b</ref>|group="note"}}

==In Italy==
[[Image:Tiberio Titi, maria maddalena d'austria.jpg|thumb|[[Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria (1589&ndash;1631)|Grandduchess Maria Maddalena]], one of Dudley's Medici patrons]]
Dudley left England in July 1605 by Calais. His lover and cousin Elizabeth Southwell accompanied him, disguised as a page. She was a daughter of Sir Robert Southwell and Lady Elizabeth Howard, who was a granddaughter of [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham]], Dudley's uncle. The couple declared that they had converted to [[Catholicism]]. Dudley married Elizabeth Southwell in [[Lyon]] in 1606, after they had received a papal dispensation because they were blood relatives, and they first settled in [[Florence]]. He began to use his father's title of Earl of Leicester and his uncle's title of Earl of Warwick.

Dudley designed and built warships for the arsenal of Tuscany and became a naval advisor to [[Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], of the [[Medici family]]. He received an annuity of 2,000 [[ducat]]s. In 1608 Dudley convinced the Duke to send the privateer galleon ''Santa Lucia Buonaventura'' to Guiana and northern Brazil in the only tentative of Italian colonization in the Americas.

===Attempts at reconciliation===
James I revoked Dudley's travel license in 1607. When he ordered Dudley to return home to provide for his deserted wife and family, Dudley refused. He was declared an [[outlaw]] and his estate was confiscated. He continued contacts with the English court through Sir Thomas Chaloner, who was now a chamberlain to [[Henry Frederick Stuart|Henry, Prince of Wales]]. He corresponded with the young Prince on the subjects of [[navigation]] and [[shipbuilding]] and in 1611 tried to broker a marriage between him and Caterina, daughter of Duke Ferdinand. Meanwhile, Henry Frederick had taken a fancy to Kenilworth Castle, calling it "the most noble and magnificent thing in the midland parts of this realm". Wanting it, he was willing to buy it from Dudley and agreed in 1611 to pay <U+00A3>14,500, with Dudley to hold the office of [[constable]] of the castle for his lifetime. When Henry died in 1612, only <U+00A3>3,000 had been paid, and it is unclear whether Dudley ever received it. The new Prince of Wales, [[Charles I of England|Charles]], then took possession of the castle but failed to pay the balance owing. In 1621, he got an [[Act of Parliament]] allowing Dudley's wife to sell the estate to him for <U+00A3>4,000.

In 1618, James I transferred the Earldoms of Leicester and Warwick to others. In 1620, Dudley convinced Grand Duchess [[Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria (1589&ndash;1631)|Maria Maddalena]], wife of the new duke [[Cosimo II]], to ask her brother [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand II]], to recognize his claim to his grandfather's title of [[Duke of Northumberland]]. Dudley succeeded on 9&nbsp;March 1620, and James I severed all negotiations for conciliation.

===Later years===
In addition to shipbuilding, Dudley was busy with many projects in Tuscany, including the [[Livorno]]'s [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] and harbour fortifications, draining local swamps, and building a palace in the heart of Florence. He also designed new galleys, and he wrote his memoirs of navigation and seamanship between 1610 and 1620. Later, Dudley incorporated his notes into six volumes of ''[[Dell'Arcano del Mare]]'' (''The Secret of the Sea''), self-published in 1646&ndash;1647. He also wrote a ''Maritime Directory'' as a manual for the Tuscan Navy but it was never published. In 1631 his wife Elizabeth died the day after giving birth to her last child. Several of his 13 children with her married into the Italian nobility. In 1644 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] created Alice Dudley, Duchess of Dudley for life&mdash;without significant prerogatives&mdash;and recognized Dudley's legitimacy but did not restore his titles and estate. Robert Dudley died on 6&nbsp;September 1649 outside Florence in Villa Rinieri. He was buried at San Pancrazio in Florence.

==''Dell'Arcano del Mare''==

The most important of Dudley's works was ''[[Dell'Arcano del Mare]]'' (Secrets of the Sea). It includes a comprehensive treatise on navigation and shipbuilding and it has become renowned as the first atlas of sea charts of the world. ''Dell'Arcano del Mare'' consists of six known volumes that illustrate Dudley's knowledge of navigation, [[shipbuilding]] and [[astronomy]] and it includes 130 original maps, all his own creations and not copied from existing maps, which was unusual for the period. Originally published at Florence in 1645 in Italian, they represent a collection of all contemporary naval knowledge. The atlas also includes a proposal for the construction of a fleet of five rates (sizes) of ships, which Dudley had designed and described. ''Dell'Arcano del Mare'' was reprinted in Florence in 1661 without the charts of the first edition. The distinctive character of Dudley's charts was influenced by the Italian baroque [[engraving|engraver]] [[Antonio Francesco Lucini]]. Later mapmakers chose not to copy Dudley's style and so it became a unique and rare relic in the history of cartography. Lucini recorded that he had spent 12 years and 5,000 pounds of copper to produce the plates.
