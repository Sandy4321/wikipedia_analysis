'''Predrag "Sa<U+0161>a" Danilovi<U+0107>''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: <U+041F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0440><U+0430><U+0433> "<U+0421><U+0430><U+0448><U+0430>" <U+0414><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>), usually referred to in [[English language|English]] as '''Sasha Danilovi<U+0107>''' (born February 26, 1970), is a retired Serbian professional [[basketball]] player, considered one of the best [[Europe]]an [[shooting guard]]s during the 1990s. Danilovi<U+0107> was voted [[Mr. Europa|Mister Europa Player of the Year]] in 1998, and was [[Lega Basket Serie A awards|Italian League MVP]] the same year.

Since 2007, he has been the president of [[KK Partizan|Partizan]], the club with which he spent six years as a player during the 1980s and early 1990s.

==Early life and career==
Born in Sarajevo to a family of [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Herzegovinian Serbs]] (father Milan from [[Ora<U+0161>je Zubci]] village near [[Trebinje]] and mother Vuka from [[Kukri<U+010D>je]] village near [[Bile<U+0107>a]]),<ref name="mozzart-2011">{{cite news | url = http://www.ekapija.com/website/sr/page/458051/Predrag-Danilovi%C4%87-predsednik-KK-Partizan-Hladni-car | language = Serbian | title = Hladni car | newspaper = Mozzart Sport | date = 2011-07-26 | accessdate = 2013-04-05}}</ref> Danilovi<U+0107> grew up in the [[Alipa<U+0161>ino polje]] neighbourhood near the RTV Sarajevo main building.<ref>{{YouTube|RJ5Fwmx22DY|Predrag Sa<U+0161>a Danilovi<U+0107> - Alipa<U+0161>ino polje}};RTS - ''Balkanskom ulicom'', 2010</ref> Already well versed in [[streetball]], he started playing organized basketball in [[KK Bosna|Bosna]]'s youth setup where he was coached by Mladen Ostoji<U+0107>. The player's talent was evident from the start and it didn't take long before he started receiving attention from bigger clubs such as [[KK Partizan|Partizan]] whose assistant coach [[Du<U+0161>ko Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] spotted the youngster at the inter-republic youth basketball cup where Danilovi<U+0107> represented [[SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]] squad.

By late 1985 Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> started courting the 15-year-old. Getting Danilovi<U+0107> and his parents to agree to a move to Belgrade proved to be the easy part; the real challenge was getting his club [[KK Bosna|Bosna]] to sign off on the transfer. Danilovi<U+0107> wasn't under a professional contract with the club, but according to Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ) rules, being a youth system prospect he needed his club's permission to complete the move. In Danilovic's own words: "Bosna people weren't too keen on me at all while I was there and they even planned on sending me out on loans to other Sarajevo-area clubs, which I didn't want at all. But then Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> started sniffing around, and they suddenly wanted to keep me. Also, Bosna's president [[Mirza Deliba<U+0161>i<U+0107>]] and Partizan's vice-president [[Dragan Ki<U+0107>anovi<U+0107>]] were good friends from their playing days so that created awkwardness as well and the whole thing dragged out for a while".<ref name="mozzart-2011"/><ref name="nin-1996">{{cite news | url = http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2379/2379d.html | language = Serbian | title = Duletov de<U+010D>ak | newspaper = [[NIN (magazine)|NIN]] | date = 1996-08-02 | accessdate = 2013-04-05}}</ref>

Since Bosna didn't seem willing to let him go, by summer 1986 Danilovi<U+0107> and Partizan decided to act unilaterally as the player moved to Belgrade knowing full well he'd have to sit out a year before taking part in official competitions. The move marked the beginning of a long friendship and professional relationship between Danilovi<U+0107> and Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> with the 28-year-old coach initially acting as mentor to the 16-year-old player. By now Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> also moved up in [[KK Partizan|Partizan]] hierarchy, becoming a head coach in place of [[Vladislav Lu<U+010D>i<U+0107>]] while young Danilovi<U+0107> trained with the first team as well as individually. Faced with the unfortunate situation, Danilovi<U+0107> could only practice with Partizan, which he did vigorously and devotedly up to 7 or 8 hours per day. He later said that it wasn't until his arrival at Partizan that he started training seriously. His living arrangements were provided by the club; they put him up in a room at the [[JNA Stadium]] that he shared with teammate [[Oliver Popovi<U+0107>]] before moving to Hotel Putnik in [[New Belgrade]] for a short time and eventually getting his own apartment in [[Blokovi|Blok 45]] that he also shared with Popovi<U+0107>. Furthermore, the club enrolled him in the streamlined [[:sr:<U+0412><U+0430><U+0437><U+0434><U+0443><U+0445><U+043E><U+043F><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0430><U+043A><U+0430><U+0434><U+0435><U+043C><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430>|technical high school]], but unable to make the classes due to long and frequent practices he soon switched to part-time education at the streamlined touristic high school.<ref name="mozzart-2011"/> Discussing his first days in Belgrade and arrival to a new club, Danilovi<U+0107> later said: {{cquote|''Certain people at Partizan liked me very much, but there were also those within the club who thought I was a 'neanderthal from Sarajevo' because I was a very brazen kid and I practiced like an animal. At that moment, for me, Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> was both a coach and a father. He molded me into a basketball player and into a man. It was from him that I learned to devote attention to individual work. I realized that talent without work means absolutely nothing. Even with hard work, sometimes it's still not enough because you don't have good fortune. Luckily I had it''.<ref name="nin-1996"/>}} Simultaneously KK Partizan tried to obtain permission to officially register their new player while Bosna for their part launched a process against the player with KSJ, which ruled in their favour, and young Danilovi<U+0107> had another year added to his ban from playing competitive basketball for any age group within Partizan's system.

Faced with new developments over the length of his ban, in the summer of 1987, 17-year-old Danilovi<U+0107> moved to [[Cookeville, Tennessee]] where he enrolled at [[Cookeville High School]], however only seven months later he went back to Belgrade. After coming back from the United States, Danilovi<U+0107> got included in the Yugoslavia under-18 national team that competed at the [[FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship|European under-18 Championship]] on home soil in [[Titov Vrbas]] and [[Srbobran]]. Coached by his mentor Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> and playing alongside promising Yugoslav juniors [[Arijan Komazec]], [[<U+017D>an Tabak]], [[Rastko Cvetkovi<U+0107>]], etc., Danilovi<U+0107> led the team to the gold medal.

==Club career==

===[[KK Partizan|Partizan]]===
In the summer of 1988, Danilovi<U+0107>'s two-year ban finally expired and the player was free to suit up for Partizan. Already familiar with the players he practiced with for more than a year, the 18-year-old joined the roster laden with talent at all positions <U+2014> 21-year-old point guard [[Aleksandar <U+0110>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>|Sa<U+0161>a <U+0110>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]], 22-year-old forward [[<U+017D>arko Paspalj]] who could play both the three and four positions, 22-year-old small forward [[Ivo Naki<U+0107>]], 20-year-old versatile center [[Vlade Divac]], and his 21-year-old backup [[Miroslav Pecarski]] as well as a pair of experienced 28-year-olds: backup point guard [[<U+017D>eljko Obradovi<U+0107>]] and backup center [[Milenko Savovi<U+0107>]]. Starting small forward [[Goran Grbovi<U+0107>]] who often also played the shooting guard position left the club for [[CD Oximesa|Oximesa]] that summer, which opened up space for incoming Danilovi<U+0107>. Coming off the season in which they made the Euroleague Final Four (losing to Maccabi in the semifinal) and lost to emerging [[KK Split|Jugoplastika]] in the [[Yugoslav Basketball League|Yugoslav League]] playoff final, the young Partizan team was looking to reclaim the domestic league title.

Young Danilovi<U+0107> immediately got big minutes at shooting guard, putting in a great debut campaign. Partizan finished the regular season in first place with a 16-6 record, same as [[KK Split|Jugoplastika]], but with better basket difference, meaning the Belgrade club would have the home court advantage in the playoffs. Winning both cup competitions that season - the [[FIBA Kora<U+0107> Cup|Kora<U+0107> Cup]] and the Yugoslav Cup - came as a great confidence boost for the young squad. The two trophies came in quick succession as Partizan played the first leg of the Kora<U+0107> Cup final away versus [[Pallacanestro Cant<U+00F9>|Wiwa Vismara Cant<U+00F9>]] losing by 13 points, before going to [[Maribor]] to play Jugoplastika in the Yugoslav Cup final and winning 87-74 and finally the return leg of the Korac Cup final on home court in [[Hala sportova]] and winning by 19 to overturn their first leg deficit and taking the trophy. Back on the domestic league front, in the playoff semifinal, Partizan easily eliminated crosstown rivals [[KK Crvena Zvezda|Crvena Zvezda]], setting up the final rematch with Jugoplastika that won that season's Euroleague in the meantime. The best-of-three final series started in Belgrade, but right away Partizan lost the home court advantage by losing the opening game 73-74. The series shifted to Split where Jugoplastika won 75-70, beating Partizan to the league championship for the second straight season.

A testament to his brilliant debut season, in summer 1989 Danilovi<U+0107> received the call up for the Yugoslav national team training camp by head coach [[Du<U+0161>an Ivkovi<U+0107>]] ahead of [[EuroBasket 1989]] and made the 12-man roster Ivkovi<U+0107> took to the tournament playing alongside club teammates Divac and Paspalj. Coming back to Partizan later that summer, the team went through major changes as both Divac and Paspalj left after signing NBA contracts, with Lakers and Spurs, respectively, while head coach Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> went to Spanish club [[CD Oximesa|Oximesa]] from [[Granada]], taking veteran center Savovi<U+0107> with him. Borislav "Reba" <U+0106>orkovi<U+0107>, who previously coached the club during two separate stints in the mid-1970s and early 1980s (winning two domestic league titles, in 1975-76 and 1980-81 seasons), became the new head coach.

Playing with a depleted roster, the season turned out to be a write-off as Partizan was no match for tougher Yugoslav clubs. Their deficiencies were specially evident at center as Pecarski who was forced into playing long minutes was often outplayed by the opposition's center line. Partizan finished the season in 8th place with a 9-13 record, missing the playoffs, the club's worst league finish in nineteen years. Despite another solid season from Danilovi<U+0107> who was well on his way to becoming one of the team's leaders, they didn't fare much better in the Yugoslav Cup or the FIBA Cup Winners' Cup, finishing both competitions at the quarterfinal stage.

In late June 1992 Danilovi<U+0107> entered the NBA Draft where he was taken in the second round by [[Golden State Warriors]] as the 43rd overall pick. He eventually decided to stay in Europe, signing with sports agent Mira Poljo, an established agent with good connections in Italy through Interperformances sports agency, who soon referred  him to her partner Luciano Capicchioni. Danilovi<U+0107> eventually signed a lucrative contract with [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Knorr Bologna]] paying him approximately $900,000 per season.

===[[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Virtus Bologna]]===
Arriving in the Italian city of Bologna, and the club Virtus, with an aura of the Euroleague champion and Final Four MVP, big things were expected of 22-year-old Danilovi<U+0107>. Earlier that summer, the club went through an ownership change with businessman [[:it:Alfredo Cazzola|Alfredo Cazzola]] acquiring it.

Coached by [[Ettore Messina]] and playing alongside point guard [[Roberto Brunamonti]] and center line of [[Bill Wennington]] and [[Augusto Binelli]],<ref>[http://195.56.77.208/team/?teamid=697 1992-93 Virtus Bologna]</ref> Danilovi<U+0107> led the team to the top of the standings in the [[:it:Serie A1 maschile FIP 1992-1993|regular season]] with a 24<U+2013>6 record, ahead of former teammate [[Sa<U+0161>a <U+0110>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]]'s [[Olimpia Milano|Philips Milano]] and reigning league champions [[Pallacanestro Treviso|Benetton Treviso]] led by [[Toni Kuko<U+010D>]], before going through the playoffs without a loss, overcoming [[:it:Olimpia Basket Pistoia|Olimpia Pistoia]], [[Pallacanestro Cant<U+00F9>|Clear Cant<U+00F9>]], and finally Kuko<U+010D>'s Treviso in the playoff final series to win the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]] title. Dueling with his old nemesis from the Yugoslav League, Danilovi<U+0107> got the better of Kuko<U+010D> this time. Establishing himself as the team's undisputed leader, Danilovi<U+0107> averaged 23.7 points per game over the course of regular season and the playoffs.<ref>[http://195.56.77.208/player/?id=DAN-PRE-70&year=1992&team=697 Danilovi<U+0107> 1992-93 Italian League stats]</ref> In contrast to the domestic league, [[Euroleague]] success proved elusive. The [[1992<U+2013>93 FIBA European Championship|campaign]] started in early October, but it was the opening [[FIBA European Championship 1992<U+2013>93 Regular Season Group A|group stage]] game on 29 October that brought Danilovi<U+0107> an uncomfortable away trip to play against [[KK Cibona|Cibona]] in [[Zagreb]]. He thus became the very first Serb to play a competitive game in the newly independent [[Croatia]] after the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] while the [[Yugoslav Wars]] were in full swing. Rattled by playing in an extremely hostile atmosphere, Danilovi<U+0107> had a poor shooting night making 5 of 15 field goals, good for only 12 points as Virtus lost by 16. Talking about the Zagreb experience, later in 1996, Danilovi<U+0107> said: "Traveling to the game I assumed there would be issues, but I certainly didn't expect that much hate. Eight thousand people showed up just to insult a Serb. Getting through that game was not easy at all for me and you can tell from my stats. Even their player [[Franjo Arapovi<U+0107>]] as well as their head coach [[Aleksandar Petrovi<U+0107> (basketball)|Aco Petrovi<U+0107>]] were hostile before the game even started wanting to hurl abuse at me, but I managed to put them in their place once we got out on the court. Also I think the two of them realized they had a rematch to play in Bologna in a few months so they didn't want to antagonize me too much".<ref name="nin-1996"/> In the rematch on home court in January 1993, Danilovi<U+0107> led the way with 9 of 12 field goal shooting and 23 points as Virtus jumped out to an early lead, recording a 40-point win by the end. Barely making it out of the [[FIBA European Championship 1992<U+2013>93 Regular Season Group A|group stage]] in the last qualifying spot with a 6-6 record meant that in their [[FIBA European Championship 1992<U+2013>93 quarterfinals|quarterfinal best-of-three series]] Virtus was playing the top-placed team from the other group - [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]], led by [[Arvydas Sabonis]]. Virtus got blown out by Real, losing the first game on home court at [[PalaDozza]] by 20 points with Danilovi<U+0107> having 4 points scored while five days later in Madrid, Real finished the job with another big victory, this time by 21 points.

In summer 1993, coach Messina left the club to take the head coaching position at the [[Italy national basketball team|Italian national team]] with returning coach Alberto Bucci coming in as his replacement at Bologna. The club got a new naming-rights sponsor, non-alcoholic Buckler Beer, as it waited to move into its new arena that was still being built. The roster largely remained the same; the only notable player personnel changes were Wennington's return to the NBA to play for the Chicago Bulls, and the arrival of former NBA player [[Cliff Levingston]] from [[PAOK B.C.|PAOK]]. With Danilovi<U+0107>'s contributions to the success of Virtus, he, together with his agent Luciano Capicchioni, also began looking at the NBA as an option again,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/23/sports/23iht-hoop_2.html The Next Kukoc Is Alive, Well and Waiting for the NBA];''The New York Times'', 23 October 1993</ref> but in the end decided to stay in Bologna.

The new season, 1993<U+2013>94, mostly mirrored the previous one as it quickly became clear that no club was a match for Virtus in the Italian League. Jumping to the top of the standings with five straight wins to open the league season, they never relinquished first place until the end, finishing the regular season with the identical 24<U+2013>6 record from the previous campaign. Well settled in Italy with monikers like ''lo Zar'' (the Tzar) and ''Zar Freddo'' (the Cold Tzar) given to him by the Italian sports media due to his prowess and calm-under-pressure demeanor on the court as well as inaccessible nature off it, Danilovi<U+0107> continued to lead the team. In December 1993, approximately midway through the season, Virtus moved into its newly built 8,650-seat arena [[PalaMalaguti]], located outside of the city core in [[Casalecchio di Reno]].

===NBA===
Even though he was selected by the [[Golden State Warriors]] with the 43rd pick overall in the [[1992 NBA Draft]] (his rights were in November 1994 trade to the [[Miami Heat]] as part of the trade that sent 25-year-old [[Billy Owens]] to the Heat while the Warriors got 29-year-old center [[Rony Seikaly]]), Danilovi<U+0107> continued playing in [[Europe]] before debuting in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He played for [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Virtus Bologna]] before he was a member of the NBA's [[Miami Heat]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]]. During his two NBA seasons ([[1995<U+2013>96 NBA season|1995]]<U+2013>[[1996<U+2013>97 NBA season|1997]]), Danilovi<U+0107> averaged 12.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2 assists per game.

==Administrative career==

===Partizan vice-president (2000&ndash;2004)===
In fall 2000, shortly after retiring from playing professionally, Danilovi<U+0107> became co-vice president of his old club [[KK Partizan]], working under new club president [[Vlade Divac]]. The appointment came about on initiative by club official [[Ivica Da<U+010D>i<U+0107>]] during the time of political upheaval in Serbia in the wake of the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>|Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> overthrow]]. Da<U+010D>i<U+0107>, the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>, was forced to leave his post at the club, saw that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from r<U+00E9>gime change, Da<U+010D>i<U+0107> saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan.<ref>{{Citation|title=Divac savetuje Da<U+010D>i<U+0107>a |url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/61059/Divac-savetuje-Dacica| date=2008-10-16| publisher=Blic}}</ref>

Since Divac was at the time still an active player in the NBA with [[Sacramento Kings]], Danilovi<U+0107> essentially ran KK Partizan.

Inheriting a head coach Darko Russo, Danilovi<U+0107> let him finish out the season before hiring old mentor and friend [[Du<U+0161>ko Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] during summer 2001. Vujo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> immediately started producing results, winning the league title in 2001-02, endind the three-year winning run of [[KK Budu<U+0107>nost]]. It was the first of nine consecutive league trophies under his command. Though continually cash-strapped, under the command of Danilovi<U+0107>, Divac, and sporting director Dragan Todori<U+0107>, the club instituted a model of bringing up domestic young players from its own youth setup or smaller clubs in [[Serbia and Montenegro]] rather than relying on foreign imports. It proved a winner both on the court and business-wise as Partizan sold its best player in regular intervals (usually every summer) and then re-invested that money into the youth system or acquiring talented youngsters from smaller clubs while making sure that squad can function with other players stepping up. Under this model, in summer 2003 [[Milo<U+0161> Vujani<U+0107>]] was sold to [[Fortitudo Bologna]] while the following summer 2004 [[Nenad Krsti<U+0107>]] got sold to [[New Jersey Nets]]. The club managed to win the domestic league FR Yugoslavia/Serbia-Montenegro league year after year, ensuring a [[Euroleague]] spot, which was essential for its bottom line.

Simultaneously, Danilovi<U+0107> was very much against his club joining the regional [[Adriatic League]]. However, by 2004, Partizan was essentially forced into the regional competition because its Euroleague spot now depended on competing regionally rather than domestically. This also brought about change in the club's business model as in the summer of 2004 they brought in already established national team players 27-year-old [[Dejan Milojevi<U+0107>]] from [[KK Budu<U+0107>nost]] and 29-year-old [[Milan Gurovi<U+0107>]] from [[KK Vojvodina]] to bolster the squad ahead of the start of [[2004<U+2013>05 ABA Goodyear League|competition]] in Adriatic League. It would prove to be one of Danilovi<U+0107>'s last orders of business at the club as he soon left KK Partizan.

===Partizan president (2007&ndash;present)===
In 2007 Danilovi<U+0107> returned to KK Partizan, this time as president. That year, he was placed on probation by the Serbian Basketball Federation due to a physical altercation with referee Marko Juras after a playoff game versus [[KK Hemofarm]] in [[Vr<U+0161>ac]]. Danilovi<U+0107> was originally suspended from all basketball-related activity for two years, but the federation later decided to reduce the punishment.<ref>[http://www.b92.net/sport/vesti.php?yyyy=2007&mm=09&dd=18&nav_id=264040 Danilovi<U+0107>u smanjena kazna za Vr<U+0161>ac]</ref>

== Personal life ==
Danilovi<U+0107> is married to Svetlana Danilovi<U+0107>, an [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]] sports reporter. The couple have three children.

He was also involved with [[Group Seven Children's Foundation|Group Seven]], a charity organization founded by seven Serbian basketball players.

On 11 February 2009, Danilovi<U+0107> filed a lawsuit against Worldwide Associates<ref>[http://dockets.justia.com/docket/indiana/insdce/1:2009cv00151/22154/ DANILOVIC v.
