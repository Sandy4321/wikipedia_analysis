'''George H. O<U+2019>Brien, Jr.''' ([[10 September]] [[1926]]-[[11 March]] [[2005]]) was a [[United States Marine Corps]] officer who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the [[United States]]'s highest military decoration, for conspicuous gallantry as a second lieutenant for spearheading the capture of an enemy-held hill while wounded by enemy fire during the [[Korean War]].  He was decorated by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] during a [[White House]] ceremony on [[27 October]] [[1953]], exactly one year to the day after the heroic action for which he was cited.

==Biography==

From December 1944 until May 1946, he was a seaman in the [[United States Merchant Marines]].

While in college, he enlisted as a private in the [[Marine Forces Reserve|United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in July 1949.

Ordered to active duty on [[27 November]] [[1951]], he entered the [[Officer Candidate School (U.S. Marine Corps)|Officer Candidate School|Officer Candidate Course]] at [[Quantico]], Virginia.

After further training at [[Camp Pendleton]], California, he embarked for [[Korea]] in September 1952, where he joined the [[1st Marine Division]]. He was promoted to major in the Reserve in 1963.

Major O'Brien passed away from complications associated with [[emphysema]] and [[pneumonia]] on [[11 March]] [[2005]] in [[Midland, Texas]]. He was laid to rest in the Texas State Cemetery in [[Austin, Texas]].

<center>
SECOND LIEUTENANT GEORGE H. O'BRIEN, JR.<br>
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE
</center>
for service as set forth in the following CITATION:
<blockquote>
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a Rifle Platoon Commander of Company H, Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on [[27 October]] [[1952]]. With his platoon subjected to an intense mortar and artillery bombardment while preparing to assault a vitally important hill position on the main line of resistance which had been overrun by a numerically superior enemy force on the preceding night, Second Lieutenant O'Brien leaped from his trench when the attack signal was given and, shouting for his men to follow raced across an exposed saddle and up the enemy-held hill through a virtual hail of deadly [[small arms|small-arms]], [[artillery]] and [[mortar (weapon)|weapon]] fire. Although shot through the arm and thrown to the ground by hostile [[automatic weapon|automatic-weapons]] fire as he neared the well-entrenched enemy position, he bravely regained his feet, waved his men onward and continued to spearhead the assault, pausing only long enough to go to the aid of a wounded Marine. Encountering the enemy at close range, he proceeded to hurl [[hand grenade]]s into the [[bunker]]s and, utilizing his [[carbine]] to best advantage in savage [[hand-to-hand combat]], succeeded in killing at least three of the enemy. Struck down by the concussion of grenades on three occasions during the subsequent action, he steadfastly refused to be evacuated for medical treatment and continued to lead his platoon in the assault for a period of nearly four hours, repeatedly encouraging his men and maintaining superb direction of the unit. With the attack halted, he set up a defense with his remaining forces to prepare for a counterattack, personally checking each position, attending to the wounded and expediting their evacuation. When a relief of the position was effected by another unit, he remained to cover the withdrawal and to assure that no wounded were left behind. By his exceptionally daring and forceful leadership in the face of overwhelming odds, Second Lieutenant O'Brien served as a constant source of inspiration to all who observed him and was greatly instrumental in the recapture of a strategic position on the main line of resistance. His indomitable determination and valiant fighting spirit reflect the highest credit upon himself and enhance the finest traditions of the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].
