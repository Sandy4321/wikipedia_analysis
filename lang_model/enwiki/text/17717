'''Carson''' was an Australian [[blues-rock]] and [[boogie rock]] band, which formed in January 1970 in Melbourne as '''Carson County Band'''. They had a top&nbsp;30 hit single on the ''[[Go-Set]]'' National Top&nbsp;40 with "Boogie" in September 1972. The group released their debut studio album, ''Blown'', in November on [[EMI]] and [[Harvest Records]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on the ''Go-Set'' Top&nbsp;20 Albums. Their performance at the second [[Sunbury Pop Festival]] in late January 1973 was issued as a live album, ''On the Air'', in April but the group had already disbanded. 

Founding member, [[John Capek]] had left by late 1970 and relocated to North America by 1973 where he worked as a composer (often with [[Marc Jordan]]), record producer and keyboardist both in Toronto, Canada and in Los Angeles, United States. His replacement in Carson, [[Broderick Smith]], formed [[country rock]]ers, [[The Dingoes]] in 1973 and also had a successful solo career.
