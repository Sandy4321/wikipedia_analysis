'''''All Grown Up!''''' is an animated television series that ran from [[April 12]], [[2003]] to [[November 30]], [[2007]] on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]. However, three episodes still remain unaired in the United States.

== Premise ==
After the success of ''[[All Growed Up]]'', the Rugrats 10th anniversary special. Nickelodeon commissioned a spin-off series based on the episode, ''All Grown Up!'' is that series. The show is about the characters of the ''[[Rugrats]]'' '''nine''' years older (as opposed to '''ten''' in the All Growed Up special).<ref>[http://www.tv.com/all-grown-up/show/12401/summary.html TV.Com]</ref> Tommy, Dil, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Kimi, Angelica and Susie now have to deal with teen and pre-teen issues and situations.<ref>[http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/show_description.jhtml?show_id=agu Show Description<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

== About the show ==

Production of the show began in September 2002. During summer 2003, teasers for ''All Grown Up'' aired. However, the scenes shown were not clips from actual episodes of the show.

The show premiered on April 12, 2003<ref>[http://www.cooltoons2.com/agu/ All Grown Up!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> as a preview before starting its regular run in late November 2003. When the series did start its regular run, more than 3.2 million viewers tuned in (over a third of all kids watching cable in the U.S.), enough to put it into the 2nd place slot for the week (behind an [[NFL]] game on [[ESPN]]) and making it the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history at the time. (The April sneak peek didn't make the top 15 cable programs for that week, due to the ongoing [[war in Iraq]].) It aired on ''[[Nick on CBS]]'' on March 14, 2004 and ended on September 9, 2004. The original titles for this series were ''All Growed Up!'' and ''Rugrats: All Growed Up!''.

In addition, in its first season, ''All Grown Up!'' had its first and only celebrity guest star. This was [[Lil Romeo]] playing Lil Q (Cupid) in episode 8, Its Cupid, Stupid.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0999075/ Lil' Romeo<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In early 2007, ''All Grown Up!'' was removed from the Nickelodeon schedule in the United States. Although it later returned, no new episodes have been produced since 2006. The show premiered on [[Nicktoons Network]] on July 6, 2008.

Nickelodeon UK aired all 55 episodes before the end of [[2006]]. However, Nickelodeon in the USA still has 3 episodes unaired.

Nickelodeon USA aired most of the final series of All Grown Up! in November 2007. This started on November 12 and ended on November 30.

At the moment, All Grown Up! currently airs one episode a week on Nickelodeon USA (Saturday or Sunday morning at 6:30/5:30c). Nickelodeon UK airs the show weekday mornings at 11am and 11:30am.  Unfortunately for the U.S., All Grown Up! does not always stick with schedule for the show.
