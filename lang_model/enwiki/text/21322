'''Antoni Gaud<U+00ED> i Cornet''', in Spanish also known as '''Antonio Gaud<U+00ED>''' ([[25 June]] [[1852]] <U+2013> [[10 June]] [[1926]]), was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[architecture|architect]] of the [[Modernisme]] ([[Art Nouveau]]) movement famous for his unique style and highly individualistic designs.


==Life==
===Birth and childhood===
Gaud<U+00ED> was born in [[Baix Camp]], in the province of [[Tarragona]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]) in [[1852]]. (While many believe his birthplace to be the town of [[Reus]], others claim it was in fact [[Riudoms]].<ref name="gaudiclub1">{{

}}</ref>) It is certain that he was [[baptism|baptized]] in Reus a day after his birth. The artist's parents, Francesc Gaud<U+00ED> Serra and Ant<U+00F2>nia Cornet Bertran, both came from families of metalsmiths.

The youngest of five, Gaud<U+00ED> found himself unable to play with friends his age because of [[rheumatism]]. Because he was in considerable pain, he was rarely able to walk on foot and was forced to ride a donkey when he wanted to venture from his home. That he remained close to home allowed him substantial free time to inspect [[nature]] and its design.<ref name="gaudiclub1"/> It has been hypothesized that it was this exposure to nature at an early age that began to hone two of his greatest qualities: observation and the analysis of nature.<ref name="artehistoria">{{cite web| url = http://www.artehistoria.com/frames.htm?http://www.artehistoria.com/historia/personajes/6764.htm | title=Biography at ArteHistoria| language=Spanish| accessdate=2005-11-09}}</ref>

===Higher education===
Gaud<U+00ED>, as an [[architecture]] student at the Escola T<U+00E8>cnica Superior d'Arquitectura in [[Barcelona]] from [[1873]] to [[1877]], achieved only mediocre grades but did well in his "Trial drawings and projects" course.<ref name="gaudiclub2">{{cite web

}}</ref> After five years of work, he was awarded the title of architect in [[1878]]. As he signed Gaud<U+00ED>'s title, Elies Rogent  declared, "I have either found a lunatic or a genius."<ref name="artehistoria">{{cite web| url = http://www.artehistoria.com/frames.htm?http://www.artehistoria.com/historia/personajes/6764.htm | title=Biography at ArteHistoria| language=Spanish| accessdate=2005-11-09}}</ref>

The newly named architect immediately began to plan and design and would remain affiliated with the school his entire life.

===Early career===
* 1878-1879 &ndash; lampposts for the [[Pla<U+00E7>a Real]] at Barcelona;
* 1878 &ndash; showcase for glove manufacturer Comella. Via this work, used at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|World's Fair in Paris]], [[Eusebi G<U+00FC>ell]] came to know the architect.<ref name="gaudiclub4">{{

* 1878-1882 &ndash; several designs for the ''Obrera Mataronense'' at [[Matar<U+00F3>]]. Only a very small part of these plans was built, but it shows Gaud<U+00ED>'s first use of parabolic arches, here in a ''wooden'' structure.
* 1883-1885 &ndash; [[Casa Vicens]];
* 1883-1885 &ndash; Villa "[[El Capricho]]" at [[Comillas]] ([[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]]);
* 1884 &ndash; [[Finca G<U+00FC>ell]]: Entrance pavillion and stables for the palace at [[Pedralbes]] (first completed building for Eusebi G<U+00FC>ell);
* 1884-1891 &ndash; completion of the crypt of the [[Sagrada Familia]] (the crypt had been started by the architect Francisco del Villar in 1882, who had to abandon the project in 1883);
* 1886-1889 &ndash; [[Palau G<U+00FC>ell]];
* 1887-1893 &ndash; Episcopal palace at [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]];
* 1889-1894 &ndash; [[Colegio Teresiano]];
* 1891-1893 &ndash; outer walls of the absis of the Sagrada Familia;
* 1892-1894 &ndash; [[Casa de los Botines]] at [[Le<U+00F3>n, Spain|Le<U+00F3>n]].

===Later years===
[[Image:Casamila.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Casa Mil<U+00E0>]], in the [[Eixample]], [[Barcelona]].]]

Gaud<U+00ED> was an ardent Catholic, to the point that in his later years, he abandoned secular work and devoted his life to Catholicism and his ''[[Sagrada Fam<U+00ED>lia]]''.  It is for this that Gaud<U+00ED> is known to many in Spain as "God's Architect".  Soon after, his closest family and friends began to die. His works slowed to a halt, and his attitude changed. Perhaps one of his closest family members <U+2013> his niece Rosa Egea <U+2013> died in 1912, only to be followed by a "faithful collaborator, Francesc Berenguer Mestres" two years later. After both tragedies, Barcelona fell on hard times, economically. The construction of ''La Sagrada Fam<U+00ED>lia'' slowed; the construction of ''La Colonia G<U+00FC>ell'' ceased altogether. Four years later, Eusebi G<U+00FC>ell, his patron, died.<ref name="gaudiclub5">{{

Perhaps it was because of this unfortunate sequence of events that Gaud<U+00ED> changed. He became reluctant to talk with reporters or have his picture taken and solely concentrated on his masterpiece, ''La Sagrada Fam<U+00ED>lia''.<ref name="gaudiclub5"/>

On [[June 8]] [[1926]], Antoni Gaud<U+00ED> was run over by a [[tram]]. Because of his ragged attire and empty pockets, multiple cab drivers refused to pick him up for fear that he would be unable to pay the fare. He was eventually taken to a pauper's hospital in Barcelona. Nobody recognized the injured artist until his friends found him the next day. When they tried to move him into a nicer hospital, Gaud<U+00ED> refused, reportedly saying "I belong here among the poor." He died two days later on [[June 10th]], [[1926]], half of Barcelona mourning his death. It was, perhaps, fitting that he was buried in the midst of his unfinished masterpiece, ''La Sagrada Fam<U+00ED>lia''.<ref name="gaudiclub5"/>

==Artistic style==
[[Image:Sagradafamilia-overview.jpg|thumb|right|Gaud<U+00ED>'s unfinished masterpiece, ''[[La Sagrada Familia|Sagrada Fam<U+00ED>lia]]'']]

Gaud<U+00ED>'s first works were designed in the style of [[gothic architecture|gothic]] and traditional Spanish architectural modes, but he soon developed his own distinct sculptural style. French architect [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]], who promoted an evolved form of gothic architecture, proved a major influence on Gaud<U+00ED>. But the student surpassed the master architect and contrived highly original designs <U+2013> irregular and fantastically intricate. Some of his greatest works, most notably ''La Sagrada Fam<U+00ED>lia'', have an almost hallucinatory power.{{citation needed}}
[[Image:Gaudi Arch.jpg|thumb|left|Arch and spiral staircase, '']]
He integrated the [[Catenary|parabolic arch]] and [[hyperboloid structure]]s, nature's organic shapes, and the fluidity of water into his architecture. While designing buildings, he observed the forces of [[gravity]] and related [[catenary]] principles.<ref name=roth>{{cite book | first=Leland M. | last=Roth | year=1993 | title=Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning | edition=First | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | id=ISBN 0-06-430158-3 | pages=452-4}}</ref> (Gaud<U+00ED> designed many of his arches upside down by hanging various weights on interconnected strings, using gravity to calculate catenaries for a natural curved arch.) 

Using the Aragonese ''[[trencad<U+00ED>s]]'' technique, Gaud<U+00ED> often decorated surfaces with broken tiles.<ref name=roth/>

The architect's work has been categorized as [[Art Nouveau]] architecture, a precursor to [[modern architecture]]. But his adoption of biomorphic shapes rather than orthogonal lines put him in a category unto himself (in Latin, ''[[sui generis]]''). His style was later echoed by that of Austrian architect [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]] (1928&ndash;2000).

Though hailed as a genius, some hypothesize that Gaud<U+00ED> was [[color blindness|color blind]] and that it was only in collaboration with [[Josep Maria Jujol]] <U+2013> an architect twenty seven years his junior whom he acknowledged as a genius in his own right <U+2013> that he produced his greatest works.{{citation needed}}

==Interests==
Gaud<U+00ED>, throughout his life, was fascinated by nature. He studied nature's angles and curves and incorporated them into his designs. Instead of relying on geometric shapes, he mimicked the way trees and humans grow and stand upright. The [[hyperboloid]]s  and [[paraboloid]]s he borrowed from nature were easily reinforced by steel rods and allowed his designs to resemble elements from the environment.

Because of his rheumatism, the artist observed a strict vegetarian diet, used [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] drug therapy, underwent water therapy, and hiked regularly. Long walks, besides suppressing his rheumatism, further allowed him to experience nature.

== Popularity ==
Gaud<U+00ED>'s originality was at first ridiculed by his peers. Indeed, he was first only supported by the rich industrialist Eusebi G<U+00FC>ell. His fellow citizens referred to the ''Casa Mil<U+00E0>'' as ''La Pedrera'' ("the quarry"), and [[George Orwell]], who stayed at Barcelona during the [[Spanish Civil War]], admittedly loathed his work. As time passed, though, his work became more famous, up to the point that he is now considered one of Spain's best and brightest.

==Social and political influences==
The opportunities afforded by Catalonia's socioeconomic and political environments were endless. Catalonians such as Antoni Gaud<U+00ED> often showcased the region's diverse art techniques in their works. By mimicking nature, such artists symbolically pushed back the province's ever-increasing industrial society. Gaud<U+00ED>, among others, promoted the Catalan nationalist movement by incorporating elements of Catalan culture in his designs.<ref name=roth/>

==Major works==
[[Image:Parcguell.jpg|thumb|right|View of the [[Park Guell|Park G<U+00FC>ell]], [[El Carmel]], [[Barcelona]].]]

* ''[[Sagrada Familia|Sagrada Fam<U+00ED>lia]]'' (1884-1926)

==Influence==
*Gaud<U+00ED>'s abandoned plans for a New York skyscraper [[hotel]] influenced the redesign of the [[World Trade Center]] after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].
*In [[1992]], five artists founded La Asociaci<U+00F3>n pro Beatificaci<U+00F3>n de Antoni Gaud<U+00ED>. The secular association has since pushed for the [[Catholic church]] to [[beatification|declare Gaud<U+00ED> blessed]].<ref name=beatify>Play<U+00E0> Maset, Josep. "The Vatican initiates the beatification process for Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<U+00ED>", in ''[[La Vanguardia]]'', Barcelona, [[12 March]] [[2000]].

*Gaud<U+00ED>'s life and work inspired [[The Alan Parsons Project]] to create the [[1987]] album ''[[Gaudi (album)|Gaud<U+00ED>]]''.
*Gaud<U+00ED>'s work inspired a shop owner in [[Muswell Hill]] London to build a shopfront in 2004 in the style of [[Casa Batll<U+00F3>]].<ref>Pete Sherlock, [http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/display.var.520264.0.0.php], ''Enfield Independent'',  [[20 August]] [[2004]].
