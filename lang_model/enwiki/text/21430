The '''Qutb complex''' ({{lang-hi|<U+0915><U+093C><U+0941><U+0924><U+0941><U+092C> <U+092A><U+0930><U+093F><U+0938><U+0930>}}, {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|<U+0642><U+0637><U+0628> <U+067E><U+0631><U+0650><U+0633><U+0631>}}}}), also spelled ''Qutab'' or ''Qutub'', is an array of monuments and buildings at [[Mehrauli]] in [[Delhi]], [[India]].  The construction of [[Qutb Minar]] was intended as a Victory Tower, to celebrate the victory of [[Mohammed Ghori]] over [[Rajput]] king, [[Prithviraj Chauhan]], in 1192 AD, by his then viceroy, [[Qutbuddin Aibak]], who later became the first [[Sultan of Delhi]] of [[Mamluk dynasty]]. After the death of the commissioner, the [[Minar]] was added upon by his successor [[Iltutmish]] (aka [[Altamash]]) and much later by [[Firoz Shah Tughlaq]], a [[Tughlaq dynasty]], [[Sultan of Delhi]] in 1368 AD.
 
The complex was added to by many subsequent rulers, including [[Firoz Shah Tughlaq]] and [[Ala ud din Khilji]] as well as the [[British Raj|British]].<ref>Page, J. A.

[[File:Qutab Minar mausoleum.jpg|230px|thumb|right|Qutb Minar and Alai Darwaza (Alai Gate), the entrance to the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque]]
The Alai Darwaza is the main [[gate]]way from southern side of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque. It was built by the second [[Khilji dynasty|Khilji]] [[Sultan of Delhi]], [[Ala-ud-din Khilji]] in 1311 AD, who also added a court to the pillared to the eastern side. The [[dome]]d gateway is decorated with red [[sandstone]] and inlaid white marble decorations, inscriptions in [[Naskh (script)|Naskh script]], latticed stone screens and showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] artisans who worked on it. This is the first building in India to employ [[Islamic architecture]] principles in its construction and ornamentation.<ref name=gov/>

The [[Slave dynasty]] did not employ true [[Islamic architecture]] styles and used false domes and false arches, this makes the Alai Darwaza, the earliest example of first true arches and true domes in India.<ref>[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_humayuntomb_char.asp World Heritage Sites - Humayun's Tomb: Characteristics of Indo-Islamic architecture] [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI).</ref> It is considered to be one of the most important buildings built in the [[Delhi sultanate]] period. With its pointed arches and spearhead of fringes, identified as lotus buds, it adds grace to the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque to which it served as an entrance.

== Qutb Minar ==

[[File:Details of the balcony, Qutub Minar.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Details of [[muqarnas]] [[corbel]] under the balcony, [[Qutub Minar]]]]

Qutb Minar is the tallest brick [[minaret]] in the world, inspired by the [[Minaret of Jam]] in [[Afghanistan]], it is an important example of early [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] architecture, which later evolved into [[Indo-Islamic Architecture]]. The Qutb Minar is 72.5 metres (239&nbsp;ft) high, has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony carried on [[muqarnas]] [[corbel]] and tapers from a diameter 14.3 metres at the base to 2.7 metres at the top, which is 379 steps away. It is listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] along with surrounding buildings and monuments. 

Built as a Victory Tower, to celebrate the victory of [[Mohammed Ghori]] over [[Rajput]] king, [[Prithviraj Chauhan]], in 1192 AD, by his then viceroy, [[Qutbuddin Aibak]], later the first Sultan of [[Mamluk dynasty]]. Its construction also marked the end last of Hindu kingdoms in North India, and the beginning of [[Islamic empires in India|Muslim rule in India]], which ended only in the 19th century with the arrival of the [[United Kingdom|British]], and even today the Qutb remains one of the most important "Towers of Victory" in the Islamic world. Aibak however, could only build the first storey, for this reason the lower storey is replete with eulogies to [[Mohammed Ghori]].<ref>{{cite book |title= History of Sultanate architecture|last=Nath |first=R.  |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1978 |publisher=Abhinav Publications|location= |isbn= |page=22 |url= |ref= |accessdate=}}</ref> The next three floors were added by his son-in-law and successor, [[Iltutmish]]. The minar was first struck by lightning in 1368 AD, which knocked off its top storey, after that it was replaced by the existing two floors by [[Firoz Shah Tughlaq]], a later [[Sultan of Delhi]] 1351 to 1388, and faced with white marble and sandstone enhancing the distinctive [[variegated]] look of the minar, as seen in lower three storeys. Thus the structure displays a marked variation in architectural styles from [[Mamluk dynasty|Aibak]] to that of [[Tughlaq dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Islam in India and Pakistan |last=Schimmel|first=Annemarie |authorlink=Annemarie Schimmel|year=1982 |publisher=BRILL |location= |isbn= 9004064796|page=4 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=r5cfAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA4&dq=Qutub+Minar#v=onepage&q=Qutub%20Minar&f=false |ref= |accessdate=}}</ref>

Inscriptions also indicate further repairs by Sultan [[Sikander Lodi]] in 1503, when it was struck by lightning once again. In 1802, the [[cupola]] on the top was thrown down and the whole pillar was damaged by an earthquake. It was repaired by Major R. Smith of the [[Royal Engineers]] who restored the Qutub Minar in 1223 replacing the [[cupola]] with a Bengali-style ''[[chhatri]]'' which was later removed by [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]], [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]] in 1848, as it looked out of place, and now stands in the outer lawns of the complex, popularly known as Smith's [[Folly]].<ref name=eich/><ref name=her>{{cite book

== Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque ==
Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque (Might<!-- OK here: don't correct it--> of Islam) (also known as the ''Qutb Mosque'' or the ''Great Mosque of Delhi'') was built by [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]], founder of the [[Mamluk]] or [[Slave dynasty]].<ref>''Southern Central Asia'', A.H.

The [[Qutub Minar]] was built simultaneously with the mosque but appears to be a stand alone structure, built as the '[[Minar]] of Jami Masjid', for the [[muezzin]] to perform [[adhan]], call for prayer, and also as a ''[[qutb]]'', an Axis or Pole of [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Islamic culture, Volume 49 |last=William Pickthall |first=Marmaduke|authorlink= |coauthors=Muhammad Asad |year=1975 |publisher=Islamic Culture Board |location= |isbn= |page=50 |url= |ref= |accessdate=}}</ref> It is reminiscent in style and design of the ''Arhai-din-ka Jhompra'' or Ajmer mosque at [[Ajmer]], [[Rajasthan]], also built by Aibak during the same time, also constructed by demolishing earlier temples and a Sanskrit school, at the site.<ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=7605 Arhai-din-ka Jhompra Mosque] archnet.org.</ref>

According to a [[Persian language|Persian]] inscription still on the inner eastern gateway, the mosque was built by the parts taken by destruction of twenty-seven [[Jain temple]]s<ref name=gov/><ref>"This fort was conquered and this Jami Masjid (Friday Mosque) built in the months of the year 587 [[Hijri year|AH]] by the Amir, the great, the glorious commander of the Army, Qutb-ud-daula wad-din, the Amir-ul-umara Aibeg, the slave of the [[Muhammad Ghuri|Sultan]], may God strengthen his helpers! The materials  of 27 idol temples, on each of which 2,000,000 Deliwal had been spent were used for this mosque. God the Great and Glorious may have mercy on that slave, every one who is in favour of the good  builder prays for this faith." Epigraphia Indo Moslemica, 1911-12, p. 13.</ref> [[Nattal Sahu|built previously]] during Tomars and Prithvi Raj Chauhan, and leaving certain parts of the temple outside the mosque proper.<ref name="Hai">Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai "Hindustan Islami Ahad Mein" (Hindustan under Islamic rule), Eng Trans by Maulana Abdul Hasan Nadwi</ref> Historical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the iconoclasm of Qutb-ud-din Aybak. This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign, although an argument goes that such iconoclasm was motivated more by politics than by religion.<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routes/1200_1299/index_1200_1299.html Index_1200-1299: Qutb ud-Din Aibak and the Qubbat ul-Islam mosque][[Columbia University]]</ref>

The mosque is built on a raised and paved courtyard, measuring {{convert|141|ft|m|abbr=on}}. X {{convert|105|ft|m|abbr=on}}, surrounded by pillared [[cloister]]s added by Iltutmish between 1210 and 1220 AD. The stone screen between prayer hall and the courtyard, stood 16 mt at its highest was added in 1196 AD, the corbelled arches had Arabic inscriptions and motifs.<ref name=her/> Entrances to the courtyard, also uses ornate ''[[mandap]]'' dome from temples, whose pillars are used extensively throughout the edifice, and in the sanctuary beyond the tall arched screens. What survives today of the sanctuary on the western side are the arched screens in between, which  once led to a series of aisles with low-domed ceilings for worshippers.<ref name=sha/>
Expansion of the mosque continued after the death of Qutb. Qutbuddin's successor [[Iltutmish]], extended the original prayer hall screen by three more arches. By the time of Iltutmish, the Mamluk empire had stabilized enough that the Sultan could replace most of his conscripted Hindu masons with Muslims. This explains why the arches added under Iltutmish are stylistically more Islamic than the ones erected under Qutb's rule, also because the material used wasn't from demolished temples. Some additions to the mosque were also done by [[Alauddin Khilji]], including the Alai Darwaza, the formal entrance to the mosque in red sandstone and white marble, and a court to the east of the mosque in 1300 AD.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

The mosque is in ruins today but indigenous [[Corbel arch|corbelled arches]], floral [[Motif (art)|motif]]s, and geometric patterns can be seen among the Islamic architectural structures. To the west of the Quwwat ul-Islam mosque is the tomb of [[Iltutmish]] which was built by the monarch in 1235.

== Iron pillar ==
[[Image:QtubIronPillar.JPG|120px|thumb|The [[Iron pillar of Delhi|Iron pillar]] in the Qutb Complex]]

{{main|Iron pillar of Delhi}}
The iron pillar is one of the world<U+2019>s foremost metallurgical curiosities. The pillar, 7.21 metre high and weighing more than six tonnes, was originally erected by [[Chandragupta II]] Vikramaditya (375<U+2013>414 AD) in front of a Vishnu Temple complex at [[Udayagiri]] around 402 AD, and later shifted by Aangpal in 10th Century AD from Udaygiri to its present location. [[Anangpal]] built a Vishnu Temple here and wanted this pillar to be a part of that temple. 

The estimated weight of the decorative bell of the pillar is 646&nbsp;kg while the main body weighs 5865&nbsp;kg thereby making the entire pillar weigh at 6,511&nbsp;kg. The pillar bears an inscription in [[Sanskrit]] in [[Brahmi script]] dating 4th century AD, which indicates that the pillar was set up as a ''Vishnudhvaja'', standard of god [[Vishnu]], on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra, believed to Chandragupta II. A deep socket on the top of this ornate capital suggests that probably an image of [[Garuda]] was fixed into it, as common in such flagpoles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Iron pillar at Qutub Minar weighs 6,511 kg: study |url= http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/008200802051541.htm|date=February 5, 2008  |work= [[The Hindu]]|publisher= |accessdate=August 14, 2009}}</ref>

== Tombs ==
=== Iltutmish ===
[[Image:Qutb Complex Shrine.JPG|120px|thumb|Tomb of [[Iltutmish]]]]
The tomb of [[Slave Dynasty]] ruler, [[Iltutmish]], the second [[Sultan of Delhi]] (r. 1211-1236 AD), built 1235 AD is also part of the Qutb complex at Mehrauli. The central chamber is a 9 mt sq. and has [[squinches]], suggesting the existence of a dome, which has since collapsed. The main cenotaph, in white marble, is placed on a raised platform in the centre of the chamber. The facade is known for its ornate carving, both at the entrance and the interior walls. The interior west wall has a prayer niche (''[[mihrab]]'') decorated with marble, and a rich amalgamation of Hindu motives into Islamic architecture, such as bell-and-chain, tassel, lotus, diamond emblems.<ref name=her/>

=== Imam Zamin ===
[[File:Qminar.jpg|right|130px|thumb|Imam Zamin's tomb next to the Alai Darwaza]]
Tomb of Imam Muhammad Ali, or Imam Zamin, stand on a raised courtyard, next to the ''Alai Darwaza''. According to an inscription of the eastern entrance to the tomb, Imam Zamin was a saint from [[Turkestan]], who settled in India in around 1500, during the [[Sikander Lodhi]]. He built his tomb during his lifetime, and was buried here after his death in 1539 AD. The sandstone structure has dome on an octagonal base, while its interior is finished in polished white plaster, and contains fine, perforated ''[[jali]]s'', or screens common in [[Lodhi dynasty|Lodhi]] period architecture.<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ccostas/266468037/ Tomb of Imam Zamin]</ref><ref>[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=24 Tomb of Imam Muhammad Ali] archnet.org.</ref>

== Alauddin Khilji's tomb and madarsa ==
[[File:Alauddin's Madrasa, Qutb complex.jpg|left|110px|thumb|[[Alauddin Khilji]]'s ''[[Madrasa]]'', which also has his tomb to the south, ca 1316 AD]]
At the back of the complex, southwest of the mosque, stands an L-shaped construction, consisting of [[Alauddin Khilji]]'s tomb dating ca 1316 AD, and a ''[[madarsa]]'', an [[Islamic seminary]] built by him. Khilji was the second [[Sultan of Delhi]] from [[Khilji dynasty]], who ruled from 1296 to 1316 AD. 

The central room of the building, which has his tomb, has now lost its dome, though many rooms of the seminary or college are intact, and since been restored. It was the first example in India, of a tomb standing alongside a ''madarsa''.<ref name=her/> Nearby stands the Alai Minar, an ambitious tower, he started constructing to rival the [[Qutub Minar]], though he died when only its first storey was built and its construction abandoned thereafter. It now stands, north of the mosque.

== Alai Minar ==
[[File:Qutb Complex Alai Minar.JPG|right|thumb|The incomplete Alai Minar]]
Alauddin Khilji started building the Alai Minar, after he had doubled the size of Quwwat ul-Islam mosque. He conceived this tower to be two times higher than [[Qutb Minar]] in proportion with the enlarged mosque. The construction was however abandoned, just after the completion of the {{convert|24.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} first-storey core; soon after death of Ala-ud-din in 1316, and never taken up by his successors of [[Khilji dynasty]]. The first storey of the Alai Minar, a giant [[rubble masonry]] core, still stands today, which was evidently intended to be covered with dressed stone later on. Noted Sufi poet and saint of his times, [[Amir Khusro]] in his work, ''Tarikh-i-Alai'', mentions Ala-ud-din's intentions to extend the mosque and also constructing another minar.<ref>[[:File:Plaque for Alai Minar, Qutub Minar complex.jpg]]</ref>

Ala-ud-din conceived a very ambitious construction programme when he decided to build the second tower of victory when he returned in triumph from his [[Deccan]] campaign. However, the Sultan died before even the first storey was finished, and the project was abandoned. Ala-ud-din felt compelled to increase even further the size of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque. His scheme called for increasing the size of the enclosure four times, providing ceremonial entrance gateways on each side, and a great minar, twice the size of the Qutb. This is the unfinished base of the mammoth tower begun by Ala-ud-din Khilji intended to give competition to Qutb Minar.

== Other monuments ==
A short distance west of the enclosure, in Mehrauli village, is the [[Adham Khan's Tomb|Tomb]] of [[Adham Khan]] who, according to legend drove the beautiful Hindu singer [[Roopmati]] to suicide following the capture of [[Mandu]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]]. When Akbar became displeased with him he ended up being heaved off a terrace in the [[Agra Fort]]. Several archeological monuments dot the Mehrauli Archeological Park, including the [[Balban's tomb]], Jamali Kamali mosque and tomb.

There are some summer palaces in the area,[Zafar Mahal], [Jahaz Mahal] next to [Hauz-i-Shamsi] lake and the tombs of the later Mughal kings of Delhi, inside a royal enclosure near the [[dargah]] shrine of Sufi saint, [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]]. Here an empty space between two of the tombs, ''sargah'', was intended for the [[Bahadur Shah II|last king of Delhi]], who died in exile in Rangoon, Burma, in 1862, following his implication in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. Also standing nearby is the ''Moti Masjid'' mosque in white marble.
