==Production history==
''Pride's Crossing'' was first produced at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[San Diego]] in January 1997. Directed by [[Jack O'Brien (director)|Jack O'Brien]],  it starred [[Cherry Jones]] as Mabel.

O'Brien and Jones reunited for the [[Lincoln Center Theatre]] production, which opened at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theatre on December 7, 1997 and closed on April 5, 1998 after 137 performances. The cast included [[Dylan Baker]], Julia McIlvaine, David Lansbury, and [[Casey Biggs]].

[[Ben Brantley]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' said the play can "seem as garrulous and repetitive as a conversation-starved alumna at a 50-year college reunion. The affection that animates the play is evident . . . so is the dramatist's ear for the music in everyday conversation. But while ''Pride's Crossing'' is infused with Ms. Howe's lyrical sense of mortality and of the traps of sexual and social identity, this latest work from the author of ''[[Coastal Disturbances]]'' can also be like something its no-nonsense heroine might start to read and throw out as romantic hokum . . . Ms. Howe has said her works tend to alienate men because of her expressly feminine perspective. But the special flavor of her writing has more to do with a kind of whimsy that translates theatrical absurdism into costume-party cuteness."
