The former '''Riede's City Bakery''' building is located on East Hyman Street in [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], Colorado, United States. It is a small wooden commercial building erected in the 1880s. In 1987 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

It is one of only two remaining [[timber framing|wood frame]] commercial buildings from the early years of Aspen's development as a silver mining [[boomtown]].<ref name="MPS cover form">{{cite web|last=Norgren|first=Barbara|title=Historic Resources of Aspen Multiple Resource Area|url=http://www.historycolorado.org/sites/default/files/files/OAHP/crforms_edumat/pdfs/635.pdf|publisher=[[History Colorado]]|date=July 31, 1986|accessdate=June 13, 2011|page=7}}</ref> It was not originally a bakery, but became known for one that was operated in the building for almost 20 years. Today it is home to a boutique that sells artwork and hand-woven rugs.

==Building==

Riede's is located on the south side of East Hyman, near its junction with South Mill Street and the [[Wheeler Opera House]], also listed on the Register. That [[city block|block]] of East Hyman has been converted into a [[pedestrian mall]], with commercial buildings on either side of the street in attached rows and tall trees and an unnamed tributary of the [[Roaring Fork River|Roaring Fork]] in the middle of [[cobblestone]] pavement. The terrain is level, with Wagner Park to the west and the slopes of [[Aspen Mountain (Colorado)|Aspen Mountain]] and its [[Aspen Mountain (ski area)|ski area]] several blocks to the south. To the south is one of the alleys connecting Aspen's streets.

The building itself is a two-story [[timber frame|wood frame]] structure with a [[false front]] on the northern (front) elevation.<ref name="Historycolorado page" /> A glass storefront with recessed double-door entry is located at street level. Above it is a small wooden [[bracket (architecture)|bracketed]] [[cornice]] setting off an area with [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]] siding topped by another, similar cornice at the roofline.

Inside the building is mostly given over to retail space with high ceilings. The second story is not used for commercial purposes. It has {{convert|1628|sqft}} of space.<ref name="Real estate listing">{{cite web|title=413 East Hyman Avenue|url=http://www.aspenreal.com/listing-details.asp?ListingID=15794|publisher=Setterfield & Bright|date=2005<U+2013>2011|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

==History==

The building was constructed in 1885; its original use is not known.<ref name="Historycolorado page" />  At that time Aspen, which had not even existed a decade earlier, was growing rapidly due to the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. New buildings were erected regularly. Many were wooden. In the late 1880s, after the city experienced a few devastating fires, including the destruction of the large Clarendon Hotel, an [[ordinance]] was passed mandating that all new commercial construction be of brick or stone.<ref name="MPS cover form" />

In 1890 Raymond Riede bought the building and opened his bakery and [[confectionery]] there. Three years later the repeal of the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] during the [[Panic of 1893]] drastically reduced the demand for silver since the federal government was no longer a buyer. Aspen's population began declining as it entered a period since known as "the quiet years".<ref name="MPS cover form" /> 

Riede continued to operate his business until 1908. As the city's population continued to decline, many of its buildings from the boom years became vacant and neglected. They fell victim to fire or the effects of the severe winters at nearly {{convert|8000|ft}} of elevation in the mountains. The bakery building, still referred to by the name of its onetime owner, remained. Today it house's Noori's Collection, a boutique selling handmade [[Persian carpet]]s and [[Native American art|Native American]] and [[Asian art|Asian art]].<ref name="Noori's Collection site">{{cite web|title=Aspen Collectible from Noori's Collection|url=http://www.nooriscollection.com/|publisher=Noori's Collection|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=June 13, 2011}}</ref> It has been valued at $3.3 million due to its location in downtown Aspen.<ref name="Real estate listing" />
