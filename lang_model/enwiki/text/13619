== Background ==

Occupy Dataran started on July 30, 2011,<ref>{{cite web|title='Occupy Dataran' ends peacefully|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/178302|publisher=The Sun, 16 Oct 2011}}</ref> with a group of people who were inspired by the 15-M Movement<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+5927><U+9A6C><U+4EBA><U+53CD><U+5E94><U+5DEE> <U+5341><U+591A><U+4EBA>"<U+5360><U+9886>"<U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+5E7F><U+573A>|url=http://www.nanyang.com/node/390508?tid=460|publisher=Nanyang Siang Pau, 16 Oct 2011}}</ref> and the [[2011 Spanish protests]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Occupy Protests Spread to Malaysia|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/dispatch/2011/10/15/occupy-protests-spread-to-malaysia/?mod=google_news_blog|publisher=The Wall Street Journal | date=15 October 2011}}</ref> The first Occupy Dataran was planned to coincide with the [[EO6]] overnight vigil organised by civil society groups, which was later canceled due to the release of the EO6.<ref>{{cite web |url= |title=EO6 Release - Victory to the people |author=S.

== KL People's Assembly ==
According to the official Facebook page, the KL People's Assembly aims to be "an open, egalitarian and democratic platform for people to share ideas, address problems, explore alternatives, propose solutions and make decisions on any issues collectively through [[consensus decision-making]] and direct participatory democratic processes".<ref>{{cite web|title=Youths congregate in Kuala Lumpur in Occupy-inspired movement|url=http://www1.chinadaily.com.cn/xinhua/2011-10-16/content_4075723.html|publisher=China Daily, 16 Oct 2011}}</ref> It starts from 8pm to 11pm, every Saturday.<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+5927><U+9A6C><U+4EBA><U+53CD><U+5E94><U+5DEE> <U+5341><U+591A><U+4EBA>"<U+5360><U+9886>"<U+72EC><U+7ACB><U+5E7F><U+573A>|url=http://www.nanyang.com/node/390508?tid=460|publisher=Nanyang Siang Pau, 16 Oct 2011}}</ref> 

The Assembly is structured in a horizontal and non-hierarchical manner with no leader or governing council.<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+6578><U+5341><U+6C11><U+773E>"<U+4F54><U+9818>"<U+7368><U+7ACB><U+5EE3><U+5834><U+2027>10<U+8B66><U+54E1><U+76E3><U+7763><U+6C92><U+963B><U+6B62><U+96C6><U+6703>|url=http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/223354?tid=1|publisher=Sin Chew Daily, 16 Oct 2011}}</ref> All members of the Assembly have equal standing and rights. The procedures, processes and ground rules were discussed and agreed upon collectively by the Assembly during their first meeting on 6 August 2011 based on a [[Consensus decision-making]] process.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dataran|first=Occupy|title=Occupy Dataran 15.10.11 Information Flyer|date=2011-10-15|month=October|pages=1}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Assembly is facilitated by a moderator<ref>{{cite web|title='Occupy Dataran' ends peacefully|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/178302|publisher=The Sun, 16 Oct 2011}}</ref>  that is weekly rotated.

=== Topics & Discussions ===

The Assembly usually begins by accepting topic proposals from members for discussion or debate. Topics that are voted and passed by everyone will set the agenda for an Assembly. Members take turns to speak by raising their hands and getting speaking approval from the moderator. If the discussion for a topic exceeds the allotted 20 minutes, the Assembly would then decide whether the topic should be extended for another 10 minutes or moved to a working group. Everyone is invited to join the working group which will meet outside of the Assembly period. The findings from the working group will be presented at the next Assembly to be debated. They avoid using delegates or representatives to make decisions for the Assembly. The final decision rests with the Assembly. The allotted 20 minutes per topic allows participants to discuss, debate and come up with proposals to be voted on.<ref>{{cite web|title=

=== Voting ===

The Assembly makes decisions through consensus to ensure that all opinions, ideas and concerns are taken into account before committing to a collective decision that work for everyone. Voting is done through the show of hand signals. Currently, a proposal is passed when there are no blocks from the Assembly during voting. Members who block a proposal are required to provide a justification.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

=== Hand Signals ===

[[Occupy hand signals|Hand signals]] are used to express opinions during deliberation and to vote. This silent expression is used to avoid shouting and disrupting a speaker.<ref>{{cite web|title=

=== Decisions ===
After a proposal is passed by consensus, the Assembly will form a working group to implement the decision and carry out the task of planning for action.<ref>{{cite web|title=New democratic occupation|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F11%2F20%2Fnation%2F9942775&sec=nation|publisher=The Star, 20 Nov 2011}}</ref> Some of the decisions that have been turned into action includes the "I love Capitalism Film Week",<ref>{{cite web|title=I Love Capitalism!|url=http://seayouthsayso.com/i-love-capitalism|work=SEA Youth Say So|publisher=SEA Youth Say So|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> the Occupy Parlimen protests to oppose the Peaceful Assembly Bill<ref>{{cite web|title=
