'''Spartacus''' ({{lang-el|<U+03A3><U+03C0><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, ''{{transl|el|Sp<U+00E1>rtakos}}''; {{lang-la|Spartacus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0014:text=Har.:chapter=12 |title=M. Tullius Cicero |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref>}}) (c. 109<U+2013>71&nbsp;BC) was a [[Thracian]] [[gladiator]], who along with the [[Gauls]] [[Crixus]], [[Oenomaus (rebel slave)|Oenomaus]], the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Castus (rebel slave)|Castus]], and the [[Celt]] [[Gannicus]], was one of the [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] leaders in the [[Third Servile War]], a major [[slave uprising]] against the [[Roman Republic]]. Little is known about Spartacus beyond the events of the war, and surviving historical accounts are sometimes contradictory and may not always be reliable. All sources agree that he was a former gladiator and an accomplished military leader.

Spartacus' struggle, interpreted by some as an example of [[Oppression|oppressed]] people fighting for their freedom against a slave-owning [[oligarchy]], has been an inspiration to many political thinkers. It has also been featured in literature, television, and film.

==Origins==
[[File:PreMacedon.png|thumb|450px|Balkan tribes, including the [[Maedi]].]]
The ancient sources agree that Spartacus was a [[Thracians|Thracian]].

==Enslavement and escape==

[[File:Expansion of Rome, 2nd century BC.gif|thumb|450px|The extent of the [[Roman Republic]] at 100 BCE.]]
According to the differing sources and their interpretation, Spartacus either was an [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] from the [[Roman legion]]s later condemned to slavery, or a captive taken by the legions.<ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#116 1:116]; '''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#8.2 8:2]. Note: Spartacus' status as an [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxilia]] is taken from the Loeb edition of Appian translated by Horace White, which states <U+201C><U+2026>who had once served as a soldier with the Romans<U+2026><U+201D>. However, the translation by John Carter in the Penguin Classics version reads: <U+201C><U+2026>who had once fought against the Romans and after being taken prisoner and sold<U+2026><U+201D>.</ref> Spartacus was trained at the gladiatorial school (''ludus'') near [[Capua]] belonging to [[Lentulus Batiatus]].
In 73 BCE, Spartacus was among a group of gladiators plotting an escape.<ref name="8:1<U+2013>2">'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#8 8:1<U+2013>2]; '''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#116 1:116]; '''Livy''', ''Periochae'', [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae091.html#95 95:2]; '''Florus''', ''Epitome'', [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#8|2.8]]. Plutarch claims 78 escaped, Livy claims 74, Appian <U+201C>about seventy<U+201D>, and Florus says <U+201C>thirty or rather more men<U+201D>. <U+201C>Choppers and spits<U+201D> is from ''Life of Crassus''.</ref>

The plot was betrayed but about 70<ref>However, according to Cicero (Ad Atticum VI, ii, 8) at the beginning his followers were much less than 50.</ref> men seized kitchen implements, fought their way free from the school, and seized several wagons of gladiatorial weapons and armor.<ref name="8:1<U+2013>2"/> The escaped slaves defeated a small force sent after them, plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more defensible position on [[Mount Vesuvius]].<ref>'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9 9:1].</ref><ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#116 1:116]; '''Florus''', ''Epitome'', [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#8|2.8]].</ref>

Once free, the escaped gladiators chose Spartacus and two Gaul slaves<U+2014>[[Crixus]] and [[Oenomaus (rebel slave)|Oenomaus]]<U+2014>as their leaders. Although Roman authors assumed that the slaves were a homogeneous group with Spartacus as their leader, they may have projected their own hierarchical view of military leadership onto the spontaneous organization of the slaves, reducing other slave leaders to subordinate positions in their accounts. The positions of Crixus and Oenomaus<U+2014>and later, Gannicus and Castus<U+2014>cannot be clearly determined from the sources.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Third Servile War==

{{details|Third Servile War}}

The response of the Romans was hampered by the absence of the Roman legions, which were already engaged in fighting a [[Quintus Sertorius|revolt in Spain]] and the [[Third Mithridatic War]]. Furthermore, the Romans considered the rebellion more of a policing matter than a war. Rome dispatched militia under the command of [[praetor]] [[Gaius Claudius Glaber]], which besieged Spartacus and his camp on Mount Vesuvius, hoping that starvation would force Spartacus to surrender. They were surprised when Spartacus had ropes made from vines, climbed down the cliff side of the volcano with his men and attacked the unfortified Roman camp in the rear, killing most of them.<ref name="1:116">'''Plutarch''we46', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/cn/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9 9:1<U+2013>3]; '''Frontinus''', ''Stratagems'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/1*.html#5.21 Book I, 5:20<U+2013>22]; '''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#116 1:116]; '''Broughton''', ''Magistrates of the Roman Republic'', p. 109.</ref> 

The slaves also defeated a second expedition, nearly capturing the praetor commander, killing his lieutenants and seizing the military equipment.<ref>'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9.4 9:4<U+2013>5]; '''Livy''', ''Periochae '', [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae091.html#95 95]; '''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#116 1:116]; '''Sallust''', ''Histories'', 3:64<U+2013>67.</ref> With these successes, more and more slaves flocked to the Spartacan forces, as did "many of the [[herder|herdsmen]] and [[shepherd]]s of the region", swelling their ranks to some 70,000.<ref>'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9.3 9:3]; '''Appian''', ''Civil War'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#116 1:116].</ref>

In these altercations Spartacus proved to be an excellent [[Military tactics|tactician]], suggesting that he may have had previous military experience. Though the slaves lacked [[Military education and training|military training]], they displayed a skillful use of available local materials and unusual tactics when facing the disciplined Roman armies.<ref>'''Frontinus''', ''Stratagems'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/1*.html#5.20 Book I, 5:20<U+2013>22] and [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/Strategemata/1*.html#7.6 Book VII:6].</ref> They spent the winter of 73<U+2013>72 BCE training, arming and equipping their new recruits, and expanding their raiding territory to include the towns of [[Nola]], [[Nocera Inferiore|Nuceria]], [[Thurii]] and [[Metapontum]].<ref name="florus_2_8">'''Florus''', ''Epitome'', [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#8|2.8]].</ref> The distance between these locations and the subsequent events indicate that the slaves operated in two groups commanded by the remaining leaders Spartacus and Crixus.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In the spring of 72 BCE, the slaves left their winter encampments and began to move northward. At the same time, the Roman Senate, alarmed by the defeat of the [[Praetorian Guard|praetorian]] forces, dispatched a pair of [[consul]]ar [[Roman legion|legions]] under the command of [[Lucius Gellius Publicola]] and [[Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus]].<ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#116 1:116<U+2013>117]; Plutarch, ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9.6 9:6]; Sallust, ''Histories'', 3:64<U+2013>67.</ref> The two legions were initially successful<U+2014>defeating a group of 30,000 slaves commanded by [[Crixus]] near Mount Garganus<ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#117 1:117]; '''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9.7 9:7]; '''Livy''', ''Periochae'' [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae096.html#96 96].</ref><U+2014>but then were defeated by Spartacus. These defeats are
depicted in divergent ways by the two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by [[Appian]] and [[Plutarch]].<ref name="app_1_117">'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#117 1:117].</ref><ref name="plutc_9_7">'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9.7 9:7].</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/ancient-history-spartacus-and-the-slave-rebellion.htm |title=Spartacus and the Slave Rebellion |publisher=Historynet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref><ref name="Shaw">{{Cite book |last= Shaw |first= Brent D. |title= Spartacus and the slave wars: a brief history with documents|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year=2001 |isbn= 0-312-23703-0}}</ref>

Alarmed by the apparently unstoppable rebellion, the Senate charged [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], the wealthiest man in Rome and the only volunteer for the position, with ending the rebellion.
Crassus was put in charge of eight legions, approximately 40,000<U+2013>50,000 trained Roman soldiers,<ref name="plutc_10_1">'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#10 10:1].</ref><ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#118 1:118]; '''Smith''', ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0501.html "Exercitus", p.494].</ref> which he treated with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit [[Decimation (Roman Army)|decimation]].<ref name="app_1_118">'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#118 1:118].</ref> When Spartacus and his followers, who for unclear reasons had retreated to the south of Italy, moved northward again in early 71 BCE, Crassus deployed six of his legions on the borders of the region and detached his [[legatus|legate]] Mummius with two legions to maneuver behind Spartacus. Though ordered not to engage the slaves, Mummius attacked at a seemingly opportune moment but was routed.<ref name="plutc_10_1_3">'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#10 10:1<U+2013>3].</ref> After this, Crassus' legions were victorious in several engagements, forcing Spartacus farther south through Lucania as Crassus gained the upper hand. By the end of 71 BCE, Spartacus was encamped in Rhegium ([[Reggio Calabria]]), near the [[Strait of Messina]].

According to [[Plutarch]], Spartacus made a bargain with [[Cilicia]]n pirates to transport him and some 2,000 of his men to [[Sicily]], where he intended to incite a slave revolt and gather reinforcements. However, he was betrayed by the pirates, who took payment and then abandoned the rebel slaves.<ref name="plutc_10_1_3" /> Minor sources mention that there were some attempts at raft and shipbuilding by the rebels as a means to escape, but that Crassus took unspecified measures to ensure the rebels could not cross to Sicily, and their efforts were abandoned.<ref>'''Florus''', ''Epitome'', [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#8|2.8]]; '''Cicero''', ''Orations'', "For Quintius, Sextus Roscius...", [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0018;query=chapter%3D%23448;layout=;loc=Ver.%205.7 5.2]</ref> Spartacus' forces then retreated toward [[Rhegium]]. Crassus' legions followed and upon arrival built fortifications across the isthmus at Rhegium, despite harassing raids from the rebel slaves. The rebels were now under siege and cut off from their supplies.<ref>'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#10.4 10:4<U+2013>5].</ref>

[[File:Spartacus II.JPG|thumb|The Fall of Spartacus]]
At this time, the legions of [[Pompey]] returned from Spain and were ordered by the Senate to head south to aid Crassus.<ref>Contrast '''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#11.2 11:2] with '''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#119 1:119].</ref> While Crassus feared that Pompey's arrival would cost him the credit, Spartacus unsuccessfully tried to reach an agreement with Crassus.<ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120 1:120].</ref> When Crassus refused, a portion of Spartacus' forces fled toward the mountains west of Petelia (modern [[Strongoli]]) in [[Bruttium]], with Crassus' legions in pursuit.<ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120 1:120]; '''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#10.6 10:6].</ref> 

When the legions managed to catch a portion of the rebels separated from the main army,<ref>'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#11.3 11:3]; '''Livy''', ''Periochae'', [http://www.livius.org/li-ln/livy/periochae/periochae096.html#97 97:1].

The final battle that saw the defeat of Spartacus in 71 BCE took place on the present territory of [[Senerchia]] on the right bank of the river Sele in the area that includes the border with Oliveto Citra up to those of Calabritto, near the village of Quaglietta, in High Sele Valley, which at that time was part of Lucania. In this area, in the past decades,{{When|date=April 2012}} there have been finds of armor and swords of the Roman era.

Plutarch, Appian and Florus all claim that Spartacus died during the battle, however Appian also reports that his body was never found.<ref>Appian, ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120 1:120]; '''Florus''', ''Epitome'', [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#8|2.8]].</ref>  Six thousand&nbsp;survivors of the revolt captured by the legions of Crassus were [[crucified]], lining the [[Appian Way]] from Rome to Capua.<ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#120 1.120].</ref>

==Objectives==

Classical historians were divided as to what the motives of Spartacus were. [[Plutarch]] writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape north into [[Cisalpine Gaul]] and disperse his men back to their homes.<ref name="plutc_9_5_6" /> If escaping the Italian peninsula was indeed his goal, it is not clear why Spartacus turned south after defeating the legions commanded by the consuls Lucius Publicola and Gnaeus Clodianus, which left his force a clear passage over the [[Alps]]. [[Appian]] and [[Florus]] write that he intended to march on Rome itself.<ref>'''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#117 1:117]; '''Florus''', ''Epitome'', [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#8|2.8]].</ref> Appian also states that he later abandoned that goal, which might have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears. None of Spartacus' actions overtly suggest that he aimed at reforming Roman society or [[Abolitionism|abolishing slavery]].

Based on the events in late 73 BCE and early 72 BCE, which suggest independently operating groups of slaves<ref>'''Plutarch''', ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9.7 9:7]; '''Appian''', ''Civil Wars'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/1*.html#117 1:117].</ref> and a statement by Plutarch that some of the escaped slaves preferred to plunder Italy, rather than escape over the Alps,<ref name="plutc_9_5_6">'''Plutarch''' ''Crassus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html#9.5 9:5<U+2013>6].</ref> some modern authors have deduced a factional split between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering.
