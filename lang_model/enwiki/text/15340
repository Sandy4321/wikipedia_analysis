The [[Hindi]] film industry centered in [[Mumbai]], commonly known as [[Bollywood]], is an extremely prolific industry. Because films are often made quickly, on limited budgets, there is much incentive for certain scriptwriters and music directors to plagiarize. In some occasions, they may mine their own work, lifting riffs and themes from earlier films, imitate successful South Asian songs or films, or copy movies or hit songs from other countries' film industries (such as [[Hollywood]], the [[South Korea|Korean]] film industry, the [[Malayalam film industry]], etc.).  

Sometimes the copying is merely a matter of imitating theme or style, and is not strictly plagiarism. However, tunes or scenes may be copied wholesale, without credit or payment to the original author.

Bollywood fans often do not agree as to whether similarities are coincidental, mere homage, or actual plagiarism.

Details of each of the above:

;''[[Chamatkar]]'' ([[1992 in film|1992]])
''Chamatkar'', directed by [[Rajiv Mehra]] is a copy of Disney movie [[Blackbeard's Ghost]]. This is one of the initial movies of [[Shahrukh Khan]].

; ''[[Akele Hum Akele Tum]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]]) 

This film was directed by [[Mansoor Khan]], and according to reviewers is a remake of ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]''. The ''[[Deccan Herald]]'' proclaimed that "Mansoor Khan's Akele Hum Akele Tum had Kramer v/s Kramer written all over it"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mumbai-central.com/bolly/msg00066.html#8|title=Inspired by...|publisher=[[Deccan Herald]]|date=[[March 23]] [[2001]]|accessdate=2006-08-07}}</ref> while Shoma Chatterji described it as "a melodramatic remake of the Dustin Hoffman starrer Kramer v/s Kramer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474976719177|title=The magic world of film remakes - India|publisher=Gather.com|first=Shoma|last=Chatterji|date=[[December 8]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-08-08}}</ref>

In ''Kramer vs. Kramer'', a housewife leaves her husband to care for their son while she goes off to find herself. In ''Akele Hum Akele Tum'', a housewife leaves her husband to care for their son to resume her career as a singer. In both movies, the wife eventually sues for divorce and custody of the child. The husband fights desperately to keep the child, to whom he has become a fully committed parent. Some scenes were copied in toto, such as a scene in ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' in which the hapless husband tries to make French toast for breakfast and botches it completely. In ''Akele Hum Akele Tum'', this becomes a botched omelette.

However, the Indian movie has a long section detailing how the parents meet, fall in love, and marry, which is completely absent in the Hollywood movie. The added material tries to cast the abandoning wife in a much better light, as a woman driven to leave by an uncaring husband. The endings also differ. In the Hollywood movie, the husband wins custody. In the Bollywood movie, the wife wins, then makes a last minute volte-face and decides to re-unite the family. The Bollywood movie also has much added material, much of it a sardonic look at the Indian film industry.

;''[[Sangharsh]]'' ([[1999 in film|1999]])
''Sangharsh'', directed by [[Tanuja Chandra]] is a copy of the Academy Award winning film [[The Silence of the Lambs (film)| The silence of the lambs]]. Sangharsh stars [[Akshay Kumar]], [[Preity Zinta]] and [[Ashutosh Rana]].

;''[[Kaante]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]])
''Kaante'', directed by Sanjay Gupta is a copy of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s [[Reservoir Dogs]]. The movie includes several Hindi movie superstars such as Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty, Rati Agnihotri and lesser known actors such as Kumar Gaurav, Namrata Singh Gujral,  Isha Koppikar, Lucky Ali and Mahesh Manjrekar.

;''[[Koi... Mil Gaya]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]])

''Koi... Mil Gaya'', directed by [[Rakesh Roshan]] and starring his son [[Hrithik Roshan]], is a copy of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]. Some of the scenes and storyline also seems to be 'inspired' by the Hollywood movies [[Flubber]], [[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]] and [[Forest Gump]].

;''[[Paap]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]])

''Paap'', directed by [[Pooja Bhatt]], is a blatant copy of Harrison Ford starrer [[Witness (1985 film)|Witness]] (1985).

;''[[Dus]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]])

;''[[Main Aisa Hi Hoon]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]])

''Main Aisa Hi Hoon'''s story of a mentally disabled coffee shop worker fighting for custody of his precocious daughter is generally agreed to have been taken from the 2001 American film ''[[I Am Sam]]''. The result, according to Planet Bollywood, was a ''"simple, mediocre version"''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetbollywood.com/Film/MainAisaHiHoon/|title=Main Aisa Hi Hoon|first=Shruti|last=Bhasin|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>, and [[Rediff.com]] felt that the ''"many songs and the flashback narrative, quite frankly, kill the movie"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/may/06aisa.htm|title=Main Aisa Hi Hoon: worth a miss!|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|first=Patcy|last=N|date=[[May 6]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

;''[[Zinda (film)|Zinda]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]])

In ''Zinda'', a man is imprisoned for 14 years by persons unknown, then freed and given four days to hit large numbers of people with a hammer until he discovers the reason for his suffering. While director [[Sanjay Gupta (Director)| Sanjay Gupta]] called ''Zinda'' a homage to every Korean film he had ever seen, [[Rediff.com]] noted ''"that would mean he has only seen ''[[Oldboy]]''"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/2006/jan/12zinda.htm|title=Dutt shines in a very dark film|publisher=Rediff.com|first=Sukanya|last=Verma|date=[[January 12]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref> The similarities between ''Zinda'' and ''Oldboy'' was such that the makers of ''Oldboy'' were reported to be considering legal action.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twitchfilm.net/archives/004169.html|title=<U+C62C><U+B4DC><U+BCF4><U+C774> (Oldboy) Makers Plan Vengeance on 'Zinda'|publisher=Twitchfilm.net|date=[[November 16]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref> While as of August 2006 no legal action appears to have been brought, Gupta's 'homage' was still the subject of a scathing attack by ''[[The Hindu]]'', who unfavourably compared the director's efforts with that of [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Copycat filmmaker lacks creativity|first=Sudish|last=Kamath|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=[[January 20]] [[2006]]}}</ref>

;''[[Malamaal Weekly]]'' (2006)

Director [[Priyadarshan]], having made his name in Bollywood with remakes of his early [[Malayalam]] films and other Malayalam films directed by others, was so confident that his newest screenplay would be considered ''"totally and absolutely original"'' that he offered an unspecified cash prize to anyone who could prove otherwise.<ref>{{cite news|title='Malamaal Weekly' is absolutely original: Priyadarshan|date=[[2006-03-10]]|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]}}</ref> The film itself is a comedy about an impoverished village turned upside down when a dead man wins the lottery. Despite the [[BBC]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/03/13/malamaal_weekly_2006_review.shtml| accessdate=2006-05-11|title=Malaamal Weekly| first=Poonam| last=Joshi| date=[[2006-03-03]]| publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>, the ''[[Hindustan Times]]''<ref>{{cite news|title='Malamaal Weekly' funny but not too stylish|publisher=Hindustan Times|date=[[March 13]] [[2006]]}}</ref> and numerous others pointing out the eerie similarity with Irish comedy ''[[Waking Ned]]'', no more has been heard of Priyadarshan's prize.
