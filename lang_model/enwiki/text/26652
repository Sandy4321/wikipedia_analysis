'''Emperor Jimmu''' (<U+795E><U+6B66><U+5929><U+7687> ''Jinmu Tenn<U+014D>''; also known as: ''Kamuyamato Iwarebiko''; given name: ''Wakamikenu no Mikoto'' or ''Sano no Mikoto'', born according to legend on [[January 1]], [[711 BCE]], and died, again according to legend, on [[March 11]], [[585 BCE]]){{citation needed}}, was the mythical founder of [[Japan]] and is the first emperor named in the traditional lists of emperors. The [[Emperor of Japan|Imperial house]] of Japan traditionally based its claim to the throne on its descent from Jimmu.

The name "Emperor Jimmu" is treated as the [[posthumous name]] of this mythical figure. In fact, being Chinese in form and Buddhist in implication, it must have been awarded centuries after the lifetime ascribed to him, as part of the compilation of legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty known as the [[Kojiki]]. "Jimmu" literally means "divine might".

According to [[Shinto]] belief, Jimmu is regarded as a direct descendant of the sun goddess, [[Amaterasu]]. Amaterasu had a son called [[Ame no Oshihomimi no Mikoto]] and through him a grandson named [[Ninigi-no-Mikoto]]. She sent her grandson to the Japanese islands where he eventually married [[Princess Konohana-Sakuya]]. Among their three sons was [[Hikohohodemi no Mikoto]], also called [[Yamasachi-hiko]], who married [[Princess Toyotama]]. She was the daughter of [[Ryujin|Owatatsumi]], the Japanese [[sea]] god and brother of Amaterasu. They had a single son called [[Hikonagisa Takeugaya Fukiaezu no Mikoto]]. The boy was abandoned by his parents at birth and consequently raised by [[Princess Tamayori]], his mother's younger sister. They eventually married and had a total of four sons. The last of them became Emperor Jimmu.

In 1889, [[Kashihara Shrine]] was built to enshrine him in [[Kashihara]], [[Nara prefecture|Nara]].

New Year's Day in the Japanese lunisolar calendar was traditionally celebrated as the regnal day of Emperor Jimmu. In 1872, the [[Meiji Era|Meiji]] government proclaimed that February 11, 660 BCE in the [[Gregorian calendar]] was the foundation day of Japan.  This mythical date was commemorated in the holiday ''Kigensetsu'' ("Era Day") from [[1872]] to [[1948]], which was resurrected in [[1966]] as the holiday ''Kenkoku Kinen no hi'' ("[[National Foundation Day]]"). 

== Jimmu's migration ==
Mythic records in [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihonshoki]] says that Jimmu's brothers originally born in Takachiho, the southern part of Kyushu (current [[Miyazaki prefecture]]), and decided to move eastward, as they found their home not appropriate to reign over the entire country. Jimmu's older brother Itsuse no Mikoto was an original leader of the migration, and they move eastward through [[Seto Inland Sea]] with navigation of local chieftain ''Sao Netsuhiko''. As they reached to Naniwa(current Osaka), they were encountered with another local chieftain ''Nagasunehiko''(in English, "Man of Long-leg"), and Itsuse was killed on the battle. Jimmu found that they were defeated because they battled eastward against the Sun, so he decided to land east side of Kii Peninsula and battle westward. They reached to Kumano, and with guide of ''Yatagarasu''(the eight legged crow), moved to Yamato. There they battled again against Nagasunehiko, and for this time, they prevailed to victory. In Yamato, [[Nigihayahi|''Nigihayahi no Mikoto'']], who also claims to be a descendant of Takamagahara Gods, was protected by Nagasunehiko. However, when Nigihayahi met Jimmu, he accepted Jimmu's legitimacy, and Jimmu ascended to the throne.
