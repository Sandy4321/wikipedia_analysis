"'''Improbable'''" is 13th episode of the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] and the 195th episode overall of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. The episode first aired in the United States on April 14, 2002 on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom. It was written and directed by series creator and executive producer [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|Monster-of-the-Week]] episode, unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. The episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 5.1 and was viewed by 5.38 million households. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. 

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]), [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]), and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, Reyes and her fellow agents investigate a serial killer who uses numerology to choose his victims. Soon, Reyes and Scully meet an unusual man who may prove more of a hindrance than a help.

"Improbable" features [[Burt Reynolds]] playing God. Reynolds was chosen for after he expressed his desire to appear in an episode of ''The X-Files'' to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea and Reynold thoroughly enjoyed filming the episode. The episode contains several elaborate effects, such a cityscape rendered to look like Reynolds head. Furthermore, the episode contains themes pertaining to fate, free will, and numerology. The tagline for this episode is "Dio Ti Ama", meaning "God loves you" in Italian, replacing the usual phrase "The Truth is Out There."

== Plot ==
Agent [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) is investigating a series of cases that she believes are linked by [[numerology]]. While explaining the case to [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]), Scully spots another possible link - a mark made by the killer's ring on the victims' faces. On consulting a numerologist, Reyes ties the murders together. However, the killer also finds the numerologist, murdering her.

Meanwhile, the killer is shown meeting up with a mysterious man ([[Burt Reynolds]]) who seems to know a lot about him and his murderous ways. He speaks in an enigmatic way, but his words do not seem to make any difference to the killer. Reyes' numerology theories do not go down well at the FBI, but the pattern of the killings, when viewed on a map, seem to show a spiral. Scully and Reyes revisit the murdered numerologist's office and meet the killer in the elevator. Scully recognizes the ring on the killer's hand as the agents exit the elevator, and draws her gun on him. The killer slips back into the elevator and gets to the parking lot first. Reyes and Scully arrive only to see a car fleeing the garage and the gate closing behind it.

They meet another person hiding in a car and demand that he come out. It is the strange man. To pass the time, Burt engages Reyes and Scully in a game of checkers, whose colors (red & black) are surrogates for Scully (a redhead) and Reyes (a brunette). These are the anticipated hair-colors of the next two victims. The exiting car was assumed to contain the killer, but realizing the killer might still be inside, they search the garage and are surprised by the killer. However, [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) arrives in the nick of time to shoot him. The mysterious man has completely disappeared. In a nearby Italian neighborhood, a party is in progress. Two men sing a jovial song and lead a crowd through the streets. The camera zooms out to reveal that the entire neighborhood, when viewed from above, suggests the appearance of Burt's face, hinting to the fact that he might be God.<ref name="twp"/>

=== Development ===
Carter later explained that humorous episodes were important to the show, especially during the "pitch-black" ninth season.<ref name="bb"/> He reasoned "there are the downbeats, and the you need the relief in the tension."<ref name="bb">Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 204</ref> The name Vicki Burdick came from a [[high school]] student [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] knew. Carter felt that he needed to kill the character "all out of fondness." Before casting [[Ellen Greene]], Carter had first spotted her on the [[movie]], ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' both in "[[New York City|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]]." The first scene shot for Greene's character took a "long day". Carter called her a "trooper" and said she was open to the direction he gave her. She had a lot of information to remember, which made the scene even more difficult. The set for that scene was created by Tim Stepeck who was the set decorator during the ninth season.<ref name="Commentary">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] |date=2002 |title=Audio Commentary for "Improbable" |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Annabeth Gish later revealed that her lines were difficult to remember. She explained, "I remember learning my lines and thinking, 'Oh my God. I've got to memorize this. It's scary. Like physics united theory, all of that."<ref name="bb"/>
[[File:Burt Reynolds 1991 portrait crop.jpg|thumb|right|160px|The episode guest starred [[Burt Reynolds]] as God.]]
This was the last episode filmed by Carter to feature Scully in the FBI autopsy scene at [[20th Century Fox]]. The different numbers seen in this scene was used to "conceit, this idea that numerology is an important part of our life and plays a part, but it really is just used here to illustrate the idea of patterns, patterns of behavior, of the ways in which numbers rule both the universe and our lives and our ability to solve things, to solve our mysteries of life, to solve these cases, which will lead them, as we'll see as the act comes to a close here, they are both [Scully and Reyes] believers of the numerological episode."<ref name="Commentary"/> The tagline for this episode is "Dio Ti Ama", meaning "God loves you" in Italian, replacing the usual phrase "The Truth is Out There." The normal line "Executive Producer: Chris Carter" is also rendered in Italian, reading, "Producttore Esecutivo: Chris Carter".<ref name="twp"/>

===Casting===
Burt Reynolds was chosen for "Improbable" after he expressed his desire to appear in an episode of ''The X-Files'' to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea and told Patrick that he would "write something good". He later noted that "as a young man, [Reynolds] meant something to me" and that the opportunity to work with him was "surreal". After Carter had written the script, he presented it to Reynolds for his approval; Reynolds approved of the script and agreed to be in the episode.<ref name="thetruth">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], et al |date=2002 |title=The Truth Behind Season 9 |location=''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]''|medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Robert Patrick later noted that Reynolds "had a great time, and he loved working with everybody."<ref name="bb"/>

===Effects and music===
The final scene, featuring Burt's face superimposed onto the cityscape, was created by special effects supervisor Mat Beck. The only actual footage in the scene is a pull-back shot of the carnival that was filmed 110 feet in the air via crane. A CGI cityscape was then created that resembled Burt Reynolds head. The two shots were sewn together, and a blur effect was added to "[make] it sell". An alternate version of the scene was created that featured Chris Carter's head instead of Reynolds. This version was included as a bonus feature on the season nine DVD set.<ref name="sfx">{{cite video |people=[[Paul Rabwin]] |year=2002 |title=Special Effects by Mat Beck with Commentary by Paul Rabwin <U+2013> "CSM Incinerates" |location= ''[[The X-Files (season 9)|The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season]]'' |medium= DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> The score for the episode, like the rest of the series, was composed by [[Mark Snow]]. Snow based much of the music in the episode off of records made by [[Karl Z<U+00E9>ro]], on the request of Carter. Carter later noted that "I had heard his music and it was so far out and it fit with exactly what I wanted to do because I wanted to recreate [the yearly celebration in] [[Little Italy]]. [...] I wanted to create that festival."<ref name="fraga">Fraga, p. 216</ref>

== Themes ==
According to [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], the "whole" idea behind the episode was about numbers and "significance of numbers in our lives starts here on the card table where the players are being dealt a hand each."<ref name="Commentary"/> He continued with "the idea is that we're all dealt hands, genetic hands, and maybe even numerological hands that give us basically the tools with which we deal and/or use for our lives."<ref name="Commentary"/> He further stated that the idea was that it was "free will" and "fate", continued with that fate was determined by our own [[Genetics|genetic]]s.<ref name="Commentary"/>

The [[villain]] in the story, Mad Wayne, had been dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he acts on his bad impulses. Carter elaborated, "Is it fate that Wayne is about, the character, this is what I was interested in exploring here. As we'll see with the introduction in a moment of a character who throws all of this into question <U+2013> God <U+2013> we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, has to do with the character Wayne."<ref name="Commentary"/> The main idea behind the episode, was that [[God]] knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in "charge of the big game".<ref name="Commentary"/> Being that God is trying to show "us the game", as it was a "game" to be "won or lost." And Wayne has lost this game.<ref name="Commentary"/>

But it's still pretty smart."<ref name="shearman"/> John Keegan from Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review and awarded it a 6 out of 10. He wrote, "Overall, this episode was amusing enough, but there was nothing about it that would prompt me to rank it as highly as the more inspired <U+201C>lite<U+201D> episodes of previous seasons. And considering that the sixth and seventh seasons suffered tremendously from too many episodes like this, it<U+2019>s a shame to see them do it again."<ref>{{cite web|last=Keegan|first=John|title=Improbable|url=http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season9/9-13.html|publisher=Critical Myth|accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref>
