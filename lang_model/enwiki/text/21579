'''Tredegar''' is a [[town]] in the county borough of [[Blaenau Gwent]], situated on the [[Sirhowy River]] in the [[Sirhowy Valley]] in south-east [[Wales]]. 

The historic [[Tredegar Iron Works]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], [[United States]] was named in honour of the town.

==History==
<!-- Wikipedia needs citations - it doesnt include myths legends or theories===Origin of the name===
The name Tredegar can be explained as ''tref deg erw''.{{Fact|date=April 2007}} ''Deg erw'' is [[Welsh language|Welsh]] for "ten acres" or "ten-acre"; ''tref'' means "town", although its original meaning was "farm" or "estate"{{Fact|date=April 2007}}.  

Alternatively, the second element could be the personal name Tegyr, [[Lenition|lenited]] to Degyr, with a change to the final vowel in the local dialect.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  Little is known about Tegyr (the Great).  Sir Tegyr was thought important enough to be included &ndash; as [[Sir Degore]] &ndash; among the twenty-five Knights listed on [[Knights of the Round Table|King Arthur's Round Table]]. He appears as King Arthur's cup-bearer in the tale of [[Culhwch and Olwen|Culhwch & Olwen]]. -->

===Industrialisation===


From the mid-16th century to 1974, Tredegar lay in the historic county of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]. It became an early centre of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in [[South Wales]]. In 1778 an [[iron]] [[furnace]] was built in Sirhowy by Thomas Atkinson and William Barrow who came to the area from London.<ref name="">"A look at Old Tredegar in photographs" Volume 1 Philip Prosser Old Bakehouse Publications 1990</ref> Fuel was needed for the furnace so men were employed to dig [[coal]] at Bryn Bach and Nantybwch, the first small scale [[coal mining]] operation in the area.

The furnace failed in 1794. In 1797, [[Samuel Homfray]], with partners [[Richard Fothergill]] and the [[Revd. Matthew Monkhouse|Matthew Monkhouse]] built a new furnace, leasing the land from the Tredegar Estate in [[Newport]].<ref name="web">[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/b.gardner/tredegar/tredpage.html B. Gardner's History of Tredegar and other information]</ref> This created the Sirhowy Ironworks that were to become the Tredegar Ironworks, named in honour of the Tredegar Estate at [[Tredegar House]] and [[Tredegar Park]] in Newport in the south of the county.

==Governance==
===Links with the Labour Party===
Tredegar has strong links with prominent Labour MPs and the history of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Labour Movement]] in the UK. It was the birthplace of [[Aneurin Bevan]],<ref name="ab">[http://www.tredegar.co.uk/ Tredegar town website]</ref> who was responsible for the introduction of the British [[National Health Service]] (NHS), and who in the 1920s was involved in the management of [[Tredegar General Hospital]]. It was also the birthplace of former Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]] who attended Georgetown Infants and Juniors.<ref name="gtown">The Georgetown Schools (1877-1989) Clarice Brown Starling Press, Newport 1989</ref> His predecessor as leader, [[Michael Foot]], was MP for the local constituency - [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Ebbw Vale]] - during his time as party leader.  Ironically, Michael Foot's constituency home was Number 10. In a further irony, Tredegar, as part of the Blaenau Gwent constitutency was for a period no longer represented by a Labour MP, with the independent Dai Davies representing the once safe Labour constitutency until the general election of 2010.

==Architecture==
[[Bedwellty House]] is a Grade 2 listed house and gardens. Originally a "low thatched-roof cottage", the old house was renovated in 1809. The present Bedwellty House was built in 1818 as a home for Samuel Homfray, whose Iron and Coal Works were the main local employers for much of the 19th century.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6503823.stm BBC NEWS | Wales | South East Wales | <U+00A3>3.6m earmarked for listed house<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The surrounding {{convert|26|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[Victorian era|Victorian]] garden and park, designed originally as a [[Holland|Dutch]] garden around which one could walk or ride without being confronted by gate, fence or outside features, contains the '''Long Shelter,''' a Grade 2 listed structure built for the [[Chartist movement]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3812011.stm BBC NEWS | Wales | South East Wales | Arson destroys historic pavilion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===The Town Clock===
One of Tredegar's main attributes is the Town Clock  - dominating the southern part of the town centre.<ref>[http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/166291 Tredegar Town Clock:: OS grid SO1408 :: Geograph British Isles - photograph every grid square!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The clock was the idea of Mrs. R P Davies the wife of the Tredegar ironworks manager, who had decided that she wanted to present a "lofty illuminated clock" and it was she who decided that it would be erected in the Circle.<ref name="hist">Old Tredegar Volume One W.Scandlett ISBN 0 9517057 0 9</ref>

<blockquote>"The clock tower is seventy-two feet high. The foundation is of masonry, on which is surmounted the cast-iron base which has four arms from each corner to a distance of sixty feet at a depth of five feet and six inches (152&nbsp;mm)  below ground level. The pillar is wholly composed of cast-iron, upon a square pediment which in turn, receives a rectangular plinth, and upon this stands a cylindrical column of smooth surface and symmetrical diameter, ornamented with suitable coping on which rests the clock surrounded with a weather vane. The plinth is inscribed on the four aspects, on the south side - Presented to the town of Tredegar from the proceeds of a bazaar promoted by the late Mrs R.P.Davis. Erected in the year 1858. On the west side is effigy of Wellington, with the legend - Wellington, England's Hero. On the North, the Royal Arms of England; and on the east, the name and description of the founder with his crest, - Charles Jordan, Iron Founder, Newport, Mon.

The clock is provided with four transparent faces or dials, each five feet three inches diameter, and these were illuminated originally by gas, but this was later changed to electricity. The minute hands are each two feet two inches long, and the hour hand one foot seven inches long. The clocks mechanism is a fifteen inch (381 mm)  mainwheel strike, with a single four-legged Gravity Escapement driving the four dials. It has a 1 1/4 second pendulum and the bob weighs two hundredweight".<ref name="cent">Tredegar Urban District Council's "Centenary Souvenir", 1958

The clock stopped working in January 2007 due to rain water affecting the rebuilt electrical mechanism. A campaign has been set up petitioning the council to repair the clock before its 150th anniversary next year.

==Culture and leisure==
Tredegar is home to ''Bryn Bach Park'', a [[country park]].

Tredegar Orpheus [[Male voice choir]]<ref>[http://www.tredegar.co.uk/icommunity/orpheus/index.html]</ref> celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009.  Originally in Tredegar there were two choirs, a glee party and a small [[chapel]] choir. In 1909, these united under the baton of Mr John Davy Evans, and thus became known as 'The Tredegar Orpheus Male Voice Choir', the name [[Orpheus]] coming from the [[Greek god]] of music.

Tredegar Town Band won the Champion [[Brass band (British style)|Band]] of Wales for the tenth time in 2010.<ref>[http://www.4barsrest.com/articles/2008/art820d.asp 4Bars Rest]</ref>
Their financial support comes from local councils and from the support of 'friends' who raise the money needed to maintain the band.<ref>[http://www.tredegartownband.org/index_files/about_us.htm Tredegar Town Band]</ref> Many other bands attract private sponsorship. 

Tredegar is home to [[rugby union]] teams  [[Tredegar RFC|Tredegar Rugby Football Club]]<ref>[http://www.tredegar-rfc.co.uk Tredegar Rugby Football Club]</ref> who play in the Swalec League Division One East and  [[Tredegar Ironsides RFC|Tredegar Ironsides Rugby Football Club]]. The club was formed in 1946.

==Claims to fame==
Tredegar has been used for numerous TV and film locations, including ''[[The District Nurse]]'' starring [[Nerys Hughes]].  In 1982, a televised version of the [[A.J. Cronin]] [[The Citadel (novel)|novel]], ''[[The Citadel (television)|The Citadel]]'', was filmed in Tredegar, starring [[Ben Cross]].  The series was based partly on Cronin's experiences as a doctor in the town, where he had worked for the [[Tredegar Medical Aid Society]] in the early 1920s. This society contributed the model which established the British [[National Health Service]].<ref name=cradle10>[http://www.cradleofnhs.org.uk/medical.htm How the Medical Aid Society started...], Tredegar Development Trust, accessed 17 May 2010</ref> Aneurin Bevan who launched the Health Service in 1948 said ""All I am doing is extending to the entire population of Britain the benefits we had in Tredegar for a generation or more. We are going to 'Tredegarise' you"<ref name=tredegarise>[http://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/a-labour-delivery.html A Labour Delivery], 60 Years of the NHS, accessed May 2010</ref>

Just north of Tredegar lies the Trefil region. Trefil found new fame in 2005 when it was used as a location for the alien [[Vogon]] homeworld in the film of [[Douglas Adams]]'s book ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.

Two slightly less savoury incidents that the town is known for are two separate riots.  In 1868 there were the election riots which took place after the locals' favourite candidate, Colonel Clifford, was not elected.  Secondly were the anti-Jewish riots of 1911 when Jewish shops were ransacked and the army had to be brought in.<ref>[http://www.tredegar.co.uk/history/ Town history on Tredegar.co.uk]</ref>

In August 2008, a car crash scene for the short film 'COW' was filmed on the Tredegar bypass <ref>[http://www.tredegar.co.uk/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=2564 Crash Scene photos and information from Tredegar.co.uk]</ref>. 'COW' was produced by Gwent Police and Tredegar Comprehensive School to highlight the dangers of texting whilst driving <ref>[http://www.gwent.police.uk/leadnews.php?a=2172 Gwent Police]</ref>.  The movie was made available online and received widespread attention, featuring on TV news programs, in newspapers and internet forums worldwide.

On 25th January 2010, the independent movie "A Bit Of [[Tom Jones (singer) |Tom Jones]]"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8480054.stm]</ref> premiered at [[Leicester Square]], [[London]].  Filmed in and around Tredegar, the film was funded by local businesses.
