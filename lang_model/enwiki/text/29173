A '''glacial lake outburst flood''' (GLOF), also known as a ''j<U+00F6>kulhlaup'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] (A ''j<U+00F6>kulhlaup'' is technically a sudden and often catastrophic flood that occurs during a volcanic erruption, but is also used to describe other sorts of glacial flooding), can occur when a lake contained by a glacier or a [[terminal moraine]] dam fails. This can happen due to [[erosion]], a buildup of [[water pressure]], an [[avalanche]] of rock or heavy snow, an [[earthquake]] or [[cryoseism]], or if a large enough portion of a glacier breaks off and massively displaces the waters in a glacial lake at its base.

==Definition==
A J<U+00F6>kulhlaup is a glacier outburst flood, principally from an ice-dammed lake. Jokulhlaup is an [[Iceland]]ic term that has been adapted into the [[English language|English]] language, and originally only referred to a glacier outburst flood triggered by a volcanic eruption, but now is accepted to describe any abrupt release of water dammed by a glacier.

J<U+00F6>kulhlaups have also been known to occur when a [[volcano]] erupts under a glacier. The ice over the volcano melts because of the heat, causing water to form a lake under the remaining ice-cap. Then the ice-cap collapses or the water breaks through the barrier in front of it, and there follows a more or less disastrous flooding of the land below the mountain. These events are similar to a type of [[lahar]].

==Monitoring==
The [[United Nations]] has a series of monitoring efforts to help prevent death and destruction in regions that are likely to experience these events. The importance of this situation has magnified over the past century due to increased populations, and the increasing number of glacial lakes that have developed due to [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]]. While all countries with glaciers are susceptible to this problem, central [[Asia]], the [[Andes]] regions of [[South America]] and those countries in [[Europe]] that have glaciers in the [[Alps]], have been identified as the regions at greatest risk.<ref>http://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/2002/issue3/0302p48_glacial_lakes_flood_threat.html</ref>

There are a number of imminent deadly GLOFs situations that have been identified worldwide. The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake is located in the Rolwaling Valley, about 110&nbsp;kilometers  (68&nbsp;miles) northeast of [[Kathmandu, Nepal]], at an altitude of 4580&nbsp;m (15,026&nbsp;ft). The lake is dammed by a 150&nbsp;m (492&nbsp;ft) high unconsolidated terminal moraine dam. The lake is growing larger every year due to the melting and retreat of the Trakarding Glacier, and has become the largest and most dangerous glacier lake in [[Nepal]], with approximately 90 to 100 million m&sup3; (117 to 130 million yd&sup3;) of water stored.<ref>http://www.dhm.gov.np/tsorol/background.htm</ref>

==Examples==
===Iceland===
The most famous are the immense Jokulhlaup released from the Vatnajokul Ice Cap in Iceland.  It is not by chance that the term J<U+00F6>kulhlaup comes from the Icelandic, as the south of Iceland has very often been victim to such catastrophes.  This was the case when in [[1996]], the volcano under the [[Gr<U+00ED>msv<U+00F6>tn]] lakes belonging to the [[Vatnaj<U+00F6>kull]] glacier erupted, and the river [[Skei<U+00F0>ar<U+00E1>]] flooded the land in front of [[Skaftafell National Park]]. The J<U+00F6>kulhlaup reached 45,000 m<SUP>3</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP> and destroyed parts of the [[Hringvegur]] (road no. 1). After the flooding some [[iceberg]]s 10 m high could be seen on the banks of the river where the glacier run had left them behind (see also [[M<U+00FD>rdalsj<U+00F6>kull]]).  The peak water release from a lake that develops around the Grimsvotn Volcanic Crater in the center of the Vatnajokul ice cap generates flows that exceed the volume of the Mississippi River.  The outbursts have occurred in 1954, 1960, 1965, 1972, 1976, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1991 and 1996.  In 1996 the outburst was very large yielding 6,000 cubic meters per second at peak flow. Some jokulhlaups release annually. Lake George near the Knik River had large annual outbreaks from 1918 to 1966. Since 1966 the Knik Glacier has retreated and an ice-dam is no longer created. Lake George might resume annual floods if the glacier thickens again and blocks the valley (Post and Mayo, 1972). 

===Alaska===
Almost every year, GLOFs occur in two locations in southeast section of Alaska. The releases associated with the Tulsequah Glacier near [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] often inundate a nearby airstrip. About 40 cabins could potentially be affected and a few have been damaged by the larger floods.  Events from Salmon Glacier near [[Hyder, Alaska|Hyder]] have damaged roads near the Salmon River.<ref>Aimee Devaris. [http://pajk.arh.noaa.gov/info/articles/jokulhlaups/jokul.htm Southeast Alaska J<U+00F6>kulhlaups.] Retrieved on 2006-[[December 3|12-03]].</ref>

===Contiguous United States===
Immense prehistoric GLOFs, known as the [[Missoula Floods]], occurred in [[North American]]'s [[Columbia River]] watershed towards the end of the last ice age.  They were the result of periodic breaches of ice dams in present day [[Montana]], resulting in the draining of a body of water now known as [[Glacial Lake Missoula]].  

A GLOF occurred [[September 6]] to [[September 12]] [[2003]], from Grasshopper Glacier in the [[Wind River Mountains]], [[Wyoming]]. Flow at the gauge site, 14 miles downstream, rose from 7.1 m&sup3;/s (250 feet&sup3;/s) base flow to a peak of 37 m&sup3;/s (1300 feet&sup3;/s) on [[September 9]]. The Downs' Fork Bridge was over-topped, woody debris was left on the bridge, and its abutments were damaged.<ref>http://www.watershed.org/wmc/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=13</ref>

===Canada===

It has been suggested <ref>R.G. Johnson and S.-E. Lauritzen (1995),"Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait j<U+00F6>kulhlaups and Heinrich events: a hypothesis" ''Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology'', '''117''', 1,  123-137</ref> that [[Heinrich events]] during last [[glaciation]] could have been caused by gigantic j<U+00F6>kulhlaups caused by from a [[Hudson Bay]] lake dammed by ice at the mouth of [[Hudson Strait]].

===Bhutan===

GLOFs occur with regularity in the valleys and low lying river plains of [[Bhutan]].<ref name="chhopel">{{cite conference | last = Chhopel | first = Karma | title = Flash Floods and Debris Flows due to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods | booktitle = Proceedings of the International Workshop on Flash Flood Forecasting coordinated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service and the World Meteorological Organization, San Jos&eacute;, Costa Rica, March 2006 | publisher = Hydro-Met Services Division, Dept. of Energy, Ministry of Trade and Industry | location = Thimphu, Bhutan | date = 2006-03-15 | format = ppt | url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/iao/FFW/2006/Presentations/Session%207/CHHOPHEL-BHUTAN.ppt | others = [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/iao/iao_FFW.php Conference web site (NOAA)], [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/iao/FFW/2006/Presentations/Session%207/Ab_04_Chhophel.pdf Abstract (pdf)]}}</ref>
