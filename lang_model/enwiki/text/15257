'''Dennis Delderfield''' (b. [[1926]]) is the leader of the [[New Britain Party]]. He is also a supporter of the [[Springbok Club]] and is involved in a number of bodies within the [[Church of England]]. He has recently been involved in an employment tribunal with [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] on its ex-verger's behalf, but was replaced by the person he represented and was described by counsel at the hearing that concluded the case (in the Church's favour) as 'entirely negligent'. He once ran a number of local [[newspaper]]s in [[England]], including the ''City of London and Dockland Times'', although the latter only publishes sporadically. He is a former member of the Court of Common Council of the [[City of London]], but lost his place when he declared [[bankruptcy]] in [[1995]].

On [[February 24]], [[1977]], Delderfield ran for office in the [[City of London and Westminster South by-election, 1977|City of London and Westminster South by-election]]. [[Peter Brooke]] was elected with 11,962 votes and a majority of nearly 8,000. Delderfield polled only 306 votes, and was the last-placed candidate. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 General Election]], he contested the Kent Mid constituency and polled 324 votes, 0.68% of all votes cast. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tories]] won with 25,400 votes and a majority of 12,543. Delderfield came fourth out of four and lost his deposit. Most recently, he was a candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 General Election]] when he stood in the [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]] constituency. He secured 888 votes, which represented a 2.3% share for that constituency. His party has since declined from its 1977 peak and he is the sole party member. The NBP is an anti-immigration [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] party, described as "as an avowedly [[Racism|racist]] [[far right]] party" by the ''Observer'' in May [[2001]].

Candidates in the 2001 General Election had to declare their election expenses. Because Delderfield was one of the 28 who did not, his name appears on the defaulters list of the [[Electoral Reform Society]].

In the May [[2002]] local elections, Delderfield and another NBP candidate contested the ward of [[St Katharine Docks|St Katherine<U+2019>s]] & [[Wapping]]: [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] won the three seats, and Delderfield polled 259 votes. Not deterred, he stood in a by-election held in the ward of [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]] and [[Cubitt Town]] on [[June 27]], [[2002]], and effectively deprived the Tories of a victory. Labour won by ten votes <U+2014> 686 to the Tory 676: Delderfield polled 19.

In his publication ''New Britain'', he declared that he would be standing for [[Mayor of London]] in the 2004 election and that the NBP would have a list of candidates for the [[Greater London Authority|GLA]]. The declared policy would be: <U+201C>To abolish the office of a Mayor for London and the Greater London Assembly because it is a waste of public money and duplicates a system that is already in operation.<U+201D> (''New Britain'', July/August [[2003]]) In the event, Delderfield did not stand and no NBP candidates were fielded.

He has recently taking a leading role in campaigning against attempts to involve [[Spain]] in running [[Gibraltar]], and is a leading advocate of Britain leaving the [[European Union]] and concentrating on the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].
