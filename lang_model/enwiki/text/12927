'''State Route&nbsp;231''' (SR&nbsp;231) is a {{convert|74.97|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] serving communities in [[Lincoln County, Washington|Lincoln]] and [[Stevens County, Washington|Stevens]] counties. The highway, located entirely west of [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] in the [[Inland Empire (Pacific Northwest)|Inland Empire]], serves [[Sprague, Washington|Sprague]], [[Edwall, Washington|Edwall]], [[Reardan, Washington|Reardan]], [[Springdale, Washington|Springdale]] and [[Chewelah, Washington|Chewelah]]. The route extends from {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 23|SR 23]]}} north of Sprague to a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|U.S. Route 2]]}} (US&nbsp;2) near Reardan and an intersection with {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 395 in Washington|US 395]]}} south of Chewelah.

Although SR&nbsp;231 was established in 1964, the US&nbsp;2 concurrency has existed as {{nowrap|[[State Road 7 (Washington 1905-1919)|State Road 7]]}} since 1909. Later, '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;2G''' (SSH&nbsp;2G) and '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;3J''' (SSH&nbsp;3J) were established in 1937 and formed SR&nbsp;231 in 1964. The highway crosses the [[Spokane River]] on the [[Spokane River Bridge at Long Lake Dam]], which was constructed in 1949 and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1995 before repair work in late 2008.

==Route description==

State Route&nbsp;231 (SR&nbsp;231) begins at {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 23|SR 23]]}} {{convert|0.79|mi|km|2}} north of [[Sprague, Washington|Sprague]] and a [[diamond interchange]] with {{nowrap|[[Interstate 90 in Washington|Interstate 90]]}} (I-90), co-signed as {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 395 in Washington|U.S. Route 395]]}} (US&nbsp;395).<ref name="log"/><ref name="i90exit245">{{cite web |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/tdo/Interchange/pdfs/SR090/090X245.pdf |title=SR 90&nbsp;&ndash; Exit 245; Junction SR 23 / SR 231 |author=Washington State Department of Transportation |date=25 February 2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> SR&nbsp;23 is the "parent" or main route of SR&nbsp;231 and travels northwest to [[Harrington, Washington|Harrington]] and south to Downtown Sprague, spanning {{convert|66.00|mi|km|2}}, {{convert|8.97|mi|km|2}} shorter than SR&nbsp;231.<ref name="log"/> Traveling northeast, the highway traverses a hill and cliff, passing Browns Lake, and turns west. The direction of the roadway becomes north through a narrow valley and SR&nbsp;231 arrives in [[Edwall, Washington|Edwall]] as Oregon Street. The roadway briefly turns east as Main Street before crossing a [[BNSF Railway]] line and continuing northeast alongside the tracks.<ref name="rail">{{cite map |title=Washington State Rail System |year=2008 |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/1DFCBFA0-1A9D-4838-A74F-7841BF22E9C3/0/Railmap_update_Sept2008.pdf |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> After turning north into the plains, the highway parallels Crab Creek to intersect {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|US 2]]}} west of [[Reardan, Washington|Reardan]].<ref name="map"/>

Becoming [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with US&nbsp;2, the road becomes Broadway Street and enters Reardan. SR&nbsp;231 turns north at Aspen Street and crosses the [[Eastern Washington Gateway Railroad]] and a marsh via a [[causeway]]. As Spring Creek Road, the highway travels northwest parallel to Spring Creek into Spring Creek Canyon. After the canyon, the roadway crosses the [[Spokane River]] on the [[Spokane River Bridge at Long Lake Dam]], the border between [[Lincoln County, Washington|Lincoln]] and [[Stevens County, Washington|Stevens]] counties, west of [[Little Falls Dam (Washington)|Little Falls Dam]] and [[Long Lake (Washington)|Long Lake]]. Nearly a mile north of the bridge, SR&nbsp;231 intersects {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 291|SR 291]]}}, a connector to [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]. After the intersection, the highway travels north through the community of Ford and continues through a valley into [[Springdale, Washington|Springdale]]. Within Springdale, the roadway is named Second Street and intersects {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 292|SR 292]]}}, which connects east to US&nbsp;395 near [[Loon Lake (Washington)|Loon Lake]]. After crossing a BNSF Railway track, Second Street turns west as Shaffer Street and passes the Springdale Community Health Center, the local [[medical clinic]].<ref name="springdalehealth">{{cite web |url=http://www.newhp.org/index.php?pageControl=springdale |title=Welcome to Springdale Community Health Center |author=N. E. Washington Health Programs |year=2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> SR&nbsp;231 crosses Sheep Creek and the same railway as Second Street and leaves Springdale, parallel to the railroad, into a valley. The highway intersects former {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 232|SR 232]]}} and ends at an intersection with US&nbsp;395 {{convert|4.27|mi|km|2}} south of [[Chewelah, Washington|Chewelah]].<ref name="log"/><ref name="map">{{google maps |title=State Route 231 |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=WA-23+N&daddr=47.732205,-117.870495+to:US-395+S&hl=en&geocode=FYz80QIdtNr3-A%3BFe1V2AIdYXD5-Ck7XDUh33KeVDGWJAZCcoaqKA%3BFUqZ3wIdX877-A&mra=ls&sll=48.207708,-117.714375&sspn=0.005012,0.009624&ie=UTF8&z=9&via=1 |year=2009 |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Spokane River Bridge at Long Lake Dam.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Spokane River Bridge at Long Lake Dam]], pictured here in 1993, was constructed in 1949 over the [[Spokane River]] and was designated as part of Secondary State Highway&nbsp;3J (SSH&nbsp;3J) during a 1963 extension. SSH&nbsp;3J was replaced by SR&nbsp;231 during the [[1964 highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 highway renumbering]] and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 24, 1993 before being repaired in late 2008.]]
