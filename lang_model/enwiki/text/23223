The '''Evangelical Lutheran Church in America''' ('''ELCA''') is a [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The ELCA officially came into existence on January 1, 1988, by the merging of three churches and as of December 31, 2009, had about 4,543,037 baptized members, with 2,527,941 of them counted as active participants in their congregations.<ref>[http://www.elca.org/~/media/Files/Who%20We%20Are/Office%20of%20the%20Secretary/Statistics/Statistics2009.pdf FORM A - SUMMARY OF CONGREGATIONAL STATISTICS AS OF 12/31/09]</ref> It is the seventh-largest religious body<ref>[http://www.wfn.org/2010/02/msg00100.html NCC's 2010 Yearbook chronicles church trends]</ref> and the largest [[Lutheran]] denomination in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.elca.org/communication/quick.html ELCA Quick Facts], retrieved December 13, 2007</ref>  The next two largest Lutheran denominations are the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] (with approximately 2.41 million members<ref>{{cite web

== History ==
The ELCA formally came into existence on January 1, 1988, creating the largest Lutheran church body in the United States. The Church is a result of a merger between the '''Lutheran Church in America''' (LCA), the '''American Lutheran Church''' (ALC) and the '''Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches''' (AELC), all of which had formally agreed in 1982 to unite after several years of discussions.  The ELCA's three predecessor churches were themselves the product of previous mergers and splits among various independent Lutheran synods in the United States.<ref>For example, see Lowell Almen, ''One Great Cloud of Witnesses'', (Minneapolis:Augsburg Fortress, 1997) p.9-12 for a brief recounting of the formation of the ELCA; or the [http://www.elca.org/communication/roots.html Roots of the ELCA] is available online (retrieved March 27, 2007</ref>

===The American Lutheran Church===
In 1960 the [[American Lutheran Church#American Lutheran Church (1930)|American Lutheran Church]], the [[United Evangelical Lutheran Church]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church (United States)|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] merged to form The [[American Lutheran Church]], with the [[Lutheran Free Church]] joining in 1963. The ALC brought approximately 2.25 million members into the ELCA. Its immigrant heritage came mostly from [[Germany]], [[Norway]], and [[Denmark]]. It was the most theologically conservative of the forming bodies, having a heritage of [[Old Lutherans|Old Lutheran]] theology.<ref name="The Lutherans in North America">Nelson, E. Clifford. [http://books.google.com/books?id=q3xyPFA_8O0C&pg=PA509#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Lutherans in North America]. Revised ed. Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1980. p. 509</ref> It joined in fellowship with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and officially held to biblical [[inerrancy]] in its constitution, although it seldom enforced it by means of heresy trials and other doctrinal discipline. Its geographic center was in the [[Upper Midwest]], especially [[Minnesota]]. Some congregations in the ALC opted not to join the merger and instead formed the [[American Association of Lutheran Churches]].

===The Lutheran Church in America===
In 1962 the [[United Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church]], the [[Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]], and the Danish [[American Evangelical Lutheran Church]] formed the [[Lutheran Church in America]]. The LCA brought approximately 2.85 million members into the ELCA.   Its immigrant heritage came mostly from Germany, [[Sweden]], [[Slovakia]], Denmark and [[Finland]].  Its demographic focus was on the East Coast (centered on [[Pennsylvania]]), with large numbers in the Midwest and some presence in the [[South Atlantic States|Southern Atlantic]] states.  There are notable exceptions, but LCA-background churches tend to be more liturgical than ALC-background churches. Its theological orientation ranged from moderately liberal to [[neo-orthodox]], with tendencies toward conservative [[Pietism]] in some rural and small-town congregations. Its theology originated in the [[Neo-Lutheranism|Neo-Lutheran]] movement.<ref name="The Lutherans in North America"/>
[[Image:Seminex.png|frame|right|The Seminex logo, circa 1974, depicting new life springing from a dead trunk. Design by Seminex faculty member Robert Werberig.]]

===The Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches===
In 1976 the [[Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches]] (AELC) was formed from congregations that left the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod in a schism precipitated by progressive-traditionalist disputes over higher criticism, [[academic freedom]] and [[ecumenism]]. Its establishment was precipitated by the [[Seminex]] controversy at the LCMS's [[Concordia Seminary]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] in 1974. The AELC brought approximately 100,000 members into the ELCA.  Its immigrant heritage came mostly from Germany; the complexion of its theology generally resembled that of the LCA, as the dissenting former "moderate" faction of the LCMS.

== Organization==

The ELCA is headed by a [[Presiding Bishop]], who is elected by the Churchwide Assembly for a term of six years. To date, three pastors have been elected to the position of presiding bishop of the ELCA.  [[Herbert W. Chilstrom]] served as the first presiding bishop from 1988 to 1995.  He was followed by [[H. George Anderson]] (1995<U+2013>2001), who had previously been the President of [[Luther College (Iowa)|Luther College]]. The current presiding bishop is [[Mark Hanson (Bishop)|Mark S. Hanson]], who also serves as president of the Lutheran World Federation. Hanson began his tenure as bishop in 2001; he was re-elected in August 2007 for a second term.
{{USALutherans}}
The ELCA is divided into [[List of ELCA synods|65 synods]], one of which is non-geographical (the [[Slovak Zion Synod]]) and 64 regional synods in the United States and the Caribbean, each headed by a synodical bishop and council.<ref>For further information about the ELCA's structure and organization, see [http://www.elca.org/secretary/constitutions/ConstitutionsBylawsandContinuingResolutions2005.pdf 2005 ELCA Constitution] (pdf document, retrieved March 27, 2007)</ref> Within the ELCA the term ''synod'' refers to the [[middle judicatory]], which is referred to in some other denominations as "districts" or "dioceses".

Outside of the United States, ELCA also has congregations in the [[Caribbean]] region ([[Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]) and one congregation in the border city of [[Windsor, Ontario]], a member of the [[Slovak Zion Synod]]. Before 1986, some of the congregations that form the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]] were part of the ELCA's predecessor churches.

Within the church structure are divisions addressing many programs and ministries. Among these are support for global mission, outdoor ministries, campus ministries, social ministries, and education. They include the [[Lutheran Peace Fellowship]], [[Lutheran Women's Caucus]], [[Lutheran Volunteer Corps]], and the Lutheran Youth Organization [[ELCA Youth Gathering]]. The denominational publishing house is [[Augsburg Fortress]], and the official denominational magazine is [[The Lutheran]]. ELCA predecessor bodies established twenty-six [[List of ELCA colleges and universities|colleges and universities now affiliated with the ELCA]].

Most local congregations are legally independent non-profit corporations that own their own property.  Actual governing practice within the congregation ranges from congregational voters' assemblies to elder-and-council-led, to congregations where the senior pastor wields great, if informal, power (more common in larger churches).<ref>See the [http://www.elca.org/secretary/constitutions/congregations/index.html Model Constitution for Congregations] (retrieved March 27, 2007) - especially Chapter 5 "Powers of the Congregation" and Chapter 7 "Property Ownership".</ref>

== Beliefs==
{{Lutheranism}}

===Lutheranism===
Lutheranism is associated with the German reformer [[Martin Luther]], with its official confessional writings found in the [[Book of Concord]]. The ELCA accepts the unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]] (not the [[Augsburg Confession Variata|variata]]) as a true witness to the [[Good news (Christianity)|Gospel]]. The ELCA is less [[Conservative Christianity|conservative]] than the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod (LCMS) or Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States respectively.<ref>See also http://archive.elca.org/questions/, http://archive.elca.org/communication/brief.html and http://archive.elca.org/communication/faith.html</ref> Although having a sizable conservative minority, most ELCA Lutherans are theologically moderate-to-liberal. Most other Lutheran bodies in the U.S. hold more strictly to [[Confessional Lutheranism]], [[Pietism]], or a combination of the two, than the ELCA does.

===Differences within the ELCA===
The ELCA has many differences of opinion among its constituent congregations, which have caused a number of disputes over social and doctrinal issues. In part, this is due to the fact that it assimilated three different Lutheran church bodies, each with its own factions and divisions, thus inheriting old intra-group conflicts while creating new inter-group ones.  Differences on issues usually reflect theological disputes between various parties.

The ELCA is a very broad organization. It contains groups of socially conservative or liberal factions with focuses on various topics such as [[liturgical renewal]],<ref>www.valpo.edu/ils</ref><ref>Cimino, Richard.  Lutherans Today, Eerdmans: Grand Rapids, 2003, 81-101.</ref> confessional Lutheranism, charismatic revivalism, moderate to liberal theology, and liberal activism. The socially liberal segment of the ELCA is represented by independent organizations such as [[Lutherans Concerned/North America]], [[Extraordinary Lutheran Ministries]], and the [[Evangelical and Ecumenical Women's Caucus]] A socially conservative Lutheran organization within the ELCA opposed to the denomination's stance on openly-gay clergy is the [[Lutheran CORE|Lutheran Coalition For Renewal]] (Lutheran CORE). Adherents of [[Evangelical Catholic]]ism  practice [[High Church Lutheranism]] and include the members of the [[Society of the Holy Trinity]]. Those oriented toward Confessional Lutheranism, [[Evangelicalism]], or an admixture of the two include the [[WordAlone]] network and those involved with [[Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ]]. Members of the [[Charismatic Movement]] include congregations and pastors associated with the [[Alliance of Renewal Churches]].

===Scripture===
The ELCA constitution states:
:This church accepts the canonical Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as the inspired Word of God and the authoritative source and norm of its proclamation, faith, and life." <ref>For more information on the history and current documents of the ELCA, look at other resources linked to the "About the ELCA" section of the [ELCA] http://www.elca.org Web site. See the series of essays, "With Confidence in God's Future" for more on ELCA's ecumenical outlook. Get it in [Word]http://archive.elca.org/communication/WithConfidence.doc, or [PDF]http://archive.elca.org/communication/WithConfidence.pdf format.</ref>

ELCA clergy tend not to subscribe to a doctrine of [[Biblical inerrancy]], but see validity in various [[Higher criticism|scholarly methods]] of analysis to help in understanding the Bible.<ref>See [http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/New-or-Returning-to-Church/Dig-Deeper/The-Bible.aspx The Bible] on the ELCA website or [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=H&word=HIGHERCRITICISM Higher Criticism] in the Christian Cyclopedia.</ref> This is in concord with most liberal Protestant bodies and in contrast to the LCMS and WELS, which practice the [[historical-grammatical method]] of biblical interpretation.

===Sacraments===
Like other Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA confesses at least two [[Sacrament]]s, [[Eucharistic_theology#Lutherans|Communion]] (or the [[Eucharist in the Lutheran Church|Eucharist]]) and [[Baptism#Reformation|Holy Baptism]] (including [[Infant_baptism#Lutherans|infant baptism]]). Confession and absolution is often included as a Sacrament, however, as it is a return to the forgiveness given in baptism, strictly speaking there are only two sacraments. Guidance on sacramental practices in the ELCA is provided in ''The Use of the Means of Grace'', a statement adopted by the 1997 Churchwide Assembly.<ref>http://www.elca.org/Growing-In-Faith/Worship/Learning-Center/The-Use-of-the-Means-of-Grace.aspx</ref>

In addition to the two sacraments, ELCA churches also practice the other five sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church <U+2014> not as sacraments, but as acts that are sacramental in character, or [[Sacramentals#Protestant_usages|sacramentals]].  These include [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmation]], [[holy orders|ordination]], [[extreme unction|anointing the sick]], [[Confession in the Lutheran Church|confession and absolution]], and [[marriage]]. Their practice and their view as "minor sacraments" varies between churches of a "[[High Church Lutheran|high]]" and "low" church nature.

====Eucharist, also called the Lord's Supper====
The ELCA holds to the Lutheran doctrine of the [[Sacramental Union]], that is, that Christ's body and blood is truly present "in, with and under" the [[Sacramental bread|bread]] and wine.<ref>[http://bookofconcord.org/sd-supper.php#para38 The Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord, Article 8, The Holy Supper, paragraph 38].</ref> All communicants [[Mouth|orally]] receive not only bread and wine, but also the same body and blood of Christ that was given for them on the cross.<ref>Cf. unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]], [http://bookofconcord.org/augsburgconfession.php#article10 Article 10: Of the Lord's Supper].</ref> Members of other denominations sometimes erroneously perceive this as a belief in [[consubstantiation]]. Lutherans, however, [[Sacramental_union#Distinction_from_other_doctrines_of_the_Real_Presence|reject the philosophical explanation of consubstantiation]], preferring to see the presence of the Lord's body and blood as mysterious rather than explainable by human philosophy. The Lutheran belief in the mysterious character of the consecrated bread and wine is more similar to Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief than most Protestants. In contrast, most Protestant church bodies doubt or openly deny that the true body and blood of Christ is eaten in the Lord's Supper.

Unlike certain other American Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA practices [[open communion]], permitting all persons baptized in the name of the Trinity with water to receive communion.  Some congregations also [[Infant communion|commune baptized infants]] similarly to Eastern Orthodox practice.  The ELCA encourages its churches to practice the Eucharist at all services, although some churches alternate between non-communion services with those containing the Lord's Supper.

=== Social issues ===
The ELCA's stances on social issues are outlined in its Social Statements and Messages.<ref>http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues.aspx</ref> Social Statements, which must be adopted by a 2/3 majority of a Churchwide Assembly, have been adopted on the following topics:
::Abortion (1991)
::Church in Society (1991)
::Death Penalty (1991)
::Economic Life (1999)
::Education (2007)
::Environment (1993)
::Health and Health Care (2003)
::Human Sexuality (2009)
::Peace (1995)
::Race, Ethnicity & Culture (1993)

====Role of women====
The ELCA [[Ordination of women in Protestant churches|ordains women as pastors]], a practice that all three of its predecessor churches adopted in the 1970s. Some have become synod bishops. The most recent ELCA hymnal, ''Evangelical Lutheran Worship'', includes alternate gender-neutral invocations and benedictions in all settings. All of the psalms and many of the hymns and parts of the liturgy have been altered to remove masculine pronouns referring to God.<ref>ELCA/ELCiC Celebrate New Hymnal. ''The Lutheran Hedgehog 1''(5). Sept.-Oct. 2006. p 6.</ref>

[[File:Augustana Lutheran Church - sign.JPG|thumb|Augustana Lutheran Church in [[Washington, D.C.]] is a "[[Reconciling in Christ]]" congregation, meaning they welcome all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.]]

====Ordination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered clergy====
{{Main|Minneapolis Churchwide Assembly}}

On August 21, 2009, the ELCA's Churchwide Assembly in [[Minneapolis]] voted to [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|ordain gays and lesbians]] in committed monogamous relationships to serve as clergy.<ref>http://www.examiner.com/x-18527-Broward-County-Liberal-Examiner~y2009m8d22-Lutheran-Church-votes-to-allow-gay-clergy</ref> By a vote of 559 to 451, delegates approved a resolution declaring that the church would find a way for people in "publicly accountable, lifelong, monogamous same-gender relationships" to serve as official ministers.  Congregations that do not wish to call these persons to ordained ministry are not required by these policy changes to do so.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/us/22lutherans.html?hpw | work=The New York Times | title=Lutheran Group Eases Limits on Gay Clergy | first1=Michael | last1=Luo | first2=Christina | last2=Capecchi | date=August 22, 2009 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref>

In reaction, [[Lutheran CORE]], which opposed the decision, stated that it would, "initiate a process that we hope will lead to a reconfiguration of North American Lutheranism." <ref>Spring, Paull W.

Accessed online on September 26, 2009 at [http://www.publicreligion.org/objects/uploads/fck/file/CVS%20Theology%20and%20LGBT.pdf]</ref>

In October 2009, the board of one of the ELCA's partner churches, the [[Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus|Evangelical Mekane Yesus Fellowship in North America]], voted to declare disunity with the ELCA. A press release stated that the board was no longer "in good conscience" "able to commune and partner with ELCA Church that has willfully disobeyed the word of God and regrettably departed from the clear instructions of the Holy Scriptures" that "marriage is only between a man and a woman."<ref>[http://www.eecmy.org/?page=!news&article=18 Mekane Yesus members fellowship rejects to roster homosexuals for Church Ministry] Accessed November 21, 2009.</ref>

In April 2010, The Church Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America adopted revisions to ministry policy documents to bring them in line with the August 2009 vote, as well as adding sections on integrity, substance abuse and addiction.<ref name="release_april_2010">{{Cite press release

====Creation and evolution====
The ELCA has not adopted an official position on [[creationism|creation]] or [[evolution]], but there is general agreement on interpreting the Bible within its historical contexts and applying critical methods of research.

====Reproductive cloning====
The ELCA has not yet taken an official position regarding reproductive cloning.  However Task Force on Genetics of the church<U+2019>s <U+201C>Church in Society<U+201D> initiative is studying the theological and ethical issues that the world is likely to face in coming years as a result of Genetic Science. The task force has issued a draft report<ref>Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Draft Social Statement on Genetics to be considered by the 2011 ELCA Churchwide Assembly, March 2010, http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Social-Statements-in-Process/Genetics/Draft-Social-Statement.aspx
</ref> for comment and discussion. The draft statement covers a wide range of topics, from [[genetic testing]] to [[Genetically modified organism|GMOs]]. A section in this report which has been described by an independent reviewer as "a remarkably nuanced analysis and statement regarding a very complex scientific, social, and religious issue."<ref>Lewis D. Eigen, "Rights & Protections of Coming Human Clones: A Remarkable Lutheran View", Scriptamus, March 19, 2010, http://scriptamus.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/rights-protections-of-coming-human-clones-a-remarkable-lutheran-view/#more-475</ref> The task force recommends opposition to reproductive cloning, as almost all religious groups currently do.  However, the main theological reasoning is unique.  Lewis D. Eigen explains:<ref>Ibid</ref>

<blockquote>
The argument they articulate is not the common but weak argument that it would be <U+201C>offensive to God,<U+201D> <U+201C>against the will of God<U+201D> or <U+201C>man encroaching into God<U+2019>s domain<U+201D>, but they observe that the clone would be denied the dignity of possessing a unique human genotype. This is an extremely interesting argument<U+2014>that each and every human being has the right to his or her own uniqueness<U+2014>particularly a unique genotype.</blockquote>

The draft statement further asserts that any clones that might be created should have full acceptance as human beings and access to rites of the church.

====Abortion====
The issue of [[Abortion debate|abortion]] is a matter of contention within the ELCA. In a Social Statement adopted in 1991,<ref>[http://www.elca.org/What-We-Believe/Social-Issues/Social-Statements/Abortion.aspx]</ref> the church set out its position on the matter as follows. The ELCA describes itself as "a community supportive of life," and encourages women to [[Crisis pregnancy center|explore alternatives]] to abortion such as [[adoption]]. However, the Social Statement asserts that there are certain circumstances under which a decision to end a [[pregnancy]] can be "morally responsible." These include cases where the pregnancy "presents a clear threat to the physical life of the woman," situations where "the pregnancy occurs when both parties do not participate willingly in sexual intercourse," and "circumstances of extreme fetal [[Disability|abnormality]], which will result in severe suffering and very early death of an infant." Regardless of the reason, the ELCA opposes abortion when "a fetus is [[Viability (fetal)|developed enough to live outside a uterus]] with the aid of [[Neonatal intensive-care unit|reasonable and necessary technology]]." The ELCA opposes "laws that deny access to safe and affordable services for morally justifiable abortions," and "laws that are primarily intended to harass those contemplating or deciding for an abortion."  The statement emphasizes the prevention of circumstances leading to abortion, specifically encouraging "appropriate forms of [[Sex_education#United_States|sex education]] in schools, community [[Christian_views_on_contraception#Lutheranism|pregnancy prevention]] programs, and [[parenting]] preparation classes."

==Practices==
===Churchwide Assemblies===
The Churchwide Assembly meets biennially in odd-numbered years and consists of elected lay and ordained voting members; between meetings of the Churchwide Assembly, the ELCA Church Council governs the denomination.

=== Church Fellowship ===
The ELCA is a member of the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[World Council of Churches]], and [[Christian Churches Together]] and is a "partner in mission and dialog" with the [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].

The Church maintains [[full communion]] relationships with member churches of the [[Lutheran World Federation]] (which is a communion of 140 autonomous national/regional Lutheran church bodies in 78 countries around the world, representing nearly 66 million Christians), the [[Moravian Church in America]], the [[Presbyterian Church USA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]], the [[Reformed Church in America]], the [[United Church of Christ]], the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] (the U.S. branch of the [[Anglican Communion]]), and the [[United Methodist Church]].

On October 31, 1999 in [[Augsburg]], Germany, the Lutheran World Federation &ndash; of which the ELCA is a member &ndash; signed the ''[[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]]'' with the Roman Catholic Church. The statement is an attempt to reconcile an historical theological divide between the two faiths. The ''Declaration'' also states that the mutual condemnations between 16th century Lutherans and the Roman Catholic Church no longer apply to those that have signed onto the document.

====ELCA and LCMS====
The differences between the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the [[Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) arise from theological, historical, and cultural factors. The LCMS was in fellowship with the American Lutheran Church, one of the ELCA predecessor bodies. Although the denominations cooperate through Lutheran World Relief and military chaplaincy, they are not officially in communion with each other.

When the first Lutheran immigrants came to North America, they started church bodies that reflected, to some degree, the churches they left behind in Europe.  Many maintained until the early 20th century their immigrant languages.  They sought pastors from the "old country" until patterns for the education of clergy could be developed here.  Eventually, [[seminaries]] and church colleges were established in many places to prepare pastors to serve congregations.

The earliest predecessor synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was constituted on August 25, 1748, in Philadelphia. It was known as the [[Ministerium of Pennsylvania|Ministerium of Pennsylvania and Adjacent States]]. The ELCA was created in 1988 by the merging of the 2.85 million member Lutheran Church in America, 2.25 million member American Lutheran Church, and the 100,000 member Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.  Previously, the ALC and LCA in the early 1960s came into being as a result of mergers of eight smaller ethnically-based Lutheran bodies composed of German, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Slovak, Dutch, and other folk.

The LCMS was established in 1847 by German immigrants fleeing the forced [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union]], who settled in [[Perry County, Missouri]].  The LCMS is the second largest Lutheran church body in North America with 2.4 million adherents. It differs from the ELCA in that the LCMS prefers a more direct application of biblical teaching to modern times, does not practice the [[ordination of women]], and does not practice [[open communion]].  In the mid-1970s the [[Seminex]] controversy over use of historical-critical biblical study led to the formation of the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches, one of the predecessor bodies of the ELCA.

The ELCA tends to be more involved in ecumenical endeavors than the LCMS, which prohibits its clergy from worshiping in ecumenical gatherings.  The ELCA is a member of the [[Lutheran World Federation]], [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[National Council of Churches|National Council of Churches USA]].  The LCMS rejects these as being [[indifferentism|unionist]].

===Ministry===
[[Image:Pastordavid.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pastor in an ELCA church]]
As a Lutheran church body, the ELCA professes belief in the "[[priesthood of all believers]]" as reflected in Martin Luther's [[To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation]], that all baptized persons have equal access to God and are all called to use their gifts to serve the body of Christ. Some people are called to "rostered ministry", or vocations of church leadership and service. After formation, theological training, and approval by local synods these people are "set aside, but not above" through ordination or commissioning/consecration. The Division for Ministry at the ELCA's headquarters is responsible for the oversight and pastoral care of rostered ministers, in addition to the synodical bishop.<ref>Information on the Division's work and the various types of rostered ministry can be found at the  [http://www.elca.org/ministry/ Division's web page].</ref> More and more ELCA congregations are employing specialized and even general ministers outside of this national oversight. The ELCA currently has four types of rostered ministers:

====Pastors (clergy)====
An ordained minister is called to the "office of public ministry" of "Word and sacrament" and considered a "steward of the mysteries" of the Church (i.e., the [[means of grace]]).  Pastors primarily serve congregations, but this role has been expanded to include other forms of ministry as well (e.g., hospital and military chaplains). Pastors are ordinarily trained at one of [[List of ELCA seminaries|eight ELCA seminaries]] located throughout the United States, although there are alternative paths for ordination to serve particular communities in which it is difficult to provide trained leaders or to allow rostering of clergy transferred from other denominations. Pastors generally hold a Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent, as well as a four-year [[master of divinity]] degree, are required to learn biblical [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and are required to complete a one-year internship of full-time service in pastoral ministry. A [[bishop]] is a pastor called to serve either a [[synod]] or as [[presiding bishop]] of the ELCA. A bishop is only a bishop as long as he or she serves in that office and returns to being known simply as a pastor when service as a bishop ends.

====Diaconal minister====
[[Deacon#Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_America|Diaconal Ministers]] are ministers of Word and Service who may serve as a [[chaplain]]s, youth ministers, or in some aspect of social justice or advocacy work. This is the newest category established by the ELCA. A Diaconal minister is similar to the role performed by permanent [[deacon#Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, & Anglicanism|deacons]] in the Episcopal Church and the United Methodist Church.

====Deaconess====
A [[Deaconess]] is a lay woman, married or single, who serves the Church in a variety of ways. Traditionally, deaconesses served in the caring professions as nurses, social workers, or teachers.

====Associate in Ministry====
Serves local congregations, synods or other ministries in a variety of roles as parish administrators, [[Church music|parish musicians]], [[Youth ministry (Evangelical)|youth ministry]] leaders, or other positions.

===Worship===
Published in 2006, ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'' is the main [[hymnal]] used in congregations. Many ELCA congregations are classically [[liturgical]] churches. Their liturgy is rooted in the Western liturgical tradition, though Lutheran-Orthodox dialog has some minimal influence on Lutheran liturgy. Because of its use of the Book of Concord, including [[Luther's Small Catechism]] and its retention of many pre-Reformation traditions, such as [[vestments]], [[feast days]], the [[Sign_of_the_Cross#Lutheranism|sign of the cross]], and the usage of a church-wide [[Agenda (liturgy)|liturgy]], there are many aspects of the typical ELCA church that are very catholic and traditional in nature. Many Lutheran churches use traditional vestments (alb, cincture, stole, chasuble, cope, etc.). Since the [[Second Vatican Council]] of the 1960s, most major parts of the ELCA's popular liturgies are worded exactly like the English Mass of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church. Many ELCA congregations use informal styles of worship or a blend of traditional and contemporary liturgical forms.

Springing from its revered heritage in the Lutheran [[Chorale]], the musical life of ELCA congregations is just as diverse as its worship.  Johann Sebastian Bach and African songs are part of the heritage and breadth of Lutheran church music.  The musical portion of the Lutheran liturgy includes [[metrical psalter]], metrical responses and hymns.  ''Evangelical Lutheran Worship'' has ten settings of Holy Communion, for example.  They range from plainsong chant, to Gospel, to Latin-style music.  Congregations worship in many languages, many of which are represented in ''Evangelical Lutheran Worship''.  Other books used in ELCA churches include the ''[[Lutheran Book of Worship]]'', ''With One Voice'', ''This Far by Faith,'' and ''Libro de Liturgia y C<U+00E1>ntico.''
