The '''Pengrowth Saddledome''' is the primary indoor [[arena]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].  It has a seating capacity of 19,289 and is the home arena of the [[Calgary Flames]] of the [[National Hockey League]], the [[Calgary Hitmen]] of the [[Western Hockey League]], and the [[Calgary Roughnecks]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]]. The facility hosts concerts, conferences and other sporting championships, and events for the [[Calgary Exhibition and Stampede]].

Located on the Stampede Grounds on the east end of [[downtown Calgary]], the Saddledome was built in 1983 to replace the [[Stampede Corral]] as the home of the Flames and to host [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] and [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics]].  The arena underwent a major renovation in 1994<U+2013>95, during which its original name of ''Olympic Saddledome'' was changed to ''Canadian Airlines Saddledome''.  The facility was given its current name in 2000 after [[Pengrowth Management Ltd.]] signed a ten-year agreement.

The Saddledome is owned by the City of Calgary who leased it to the Saddledome Foundation, a [[non-profit organization]], to oversee its operation.  It is managed by the Calgary Flames who have a lease agreement until 2014.  The Flames have expressed a desire to build a new arena, leaving the long term future of the facility unclear.

==Planning and construction==
Calgary had been served for 30 years by the [[Stampede Corral]] when the [[Calgary Flames]] arrived in 1980.  With a total capacity of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950,<ref>{{cite news |last=Toth |first=Dan |title=Shootout at the Stampede Corral |work=Calgary Sun |date=2005-02-12 |page=10}}</ref> but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) in 1977, leading the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Calgary Cowboys]] to fold rather than hope to be a team selected to merge with the NHL.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zeman |first=Gary |title=Alberta on Ice |year=1985 |page=90 |publisher=GMS Ventures |isbn=0969232004}}</ref>

Calgary's bid to host the [[1988 Winter Olympics]], coupled with the arrival of the Flames, drove the need to build a new arena.  City Council debated the merits of several locations for the city's new Olympic Coliseum, and narrowed their choices down to two areas in the [[Victoria Park, Calgary|Victoria Park]] neighbourhood on the east end of downtown.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pratt |first=Sheila |title=Coliseum decision today <U+2014> east end has edge |work=Calgary Herald |page=A1 |date=1981-03-03}}</ref> Two other sites, one on the west end of downtown, and a late bid by several businessmen pushing to build the arena in the northern suburb of [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]] were also considered.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tennant |first=Jack |title=Airdrie logical site for coliseum |work=Calgary Sun |page=5 |date=1981-02-12}}</ref>

The Victoria Park Community Association fought the bid to build the arena in their neighborhood, threatening to oppose the city's Olympic bid if necessary.<ref>{{cite news |last=St. Laurent |first=Steve |title=Residents will fight coliseum |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-03-02 |page=A1}}</ref>  City Council voted on March 3, 1981 to build the proposed 20,000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park.<ref>{{cite news |last=Warden |first=Kathryn |title=Stampede picked for coliseum |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-03-04 |page=A1}}</ref> The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land to allow for the new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pratt |first=Sheila |title=Klein tries end run in coliseum battle |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-07-25 |page=A1}}</ref> In a bid to end the battle, Mayor [[Ralph Klein]] asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cotton |first=Crosbie |title=Klein's action may guarantee Games |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-07-28 |page=B1}}</ref> The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final hurdle is cleared for coliseum |work=Calgary Herald |date=1981-07-29 |page=A1}}</ref> The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena.<ref name="ConstructionStart">{{cite news |last=Cotton |first=Crosbie |title=Work starts on coliseum site |work=Calgary Herald |date=1980-07-30 |page=B1}}</ref>

The facility was designed by Graham McCourt Architects.  While they set out to design a unique building, the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team.<ref name="Herald25thP1">{{cite news |last=Remington |first=Robert |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=bb367c51-527e-4abc-b61a-39821fa3f0f9 |title=Sensational Saddledome helped define Calgary |work=Calgary Herald |page=A3 |date=2008-10-12 |accessdate=2008-10-21}}</ref>  The [[saddle roof|roof]] of the building was designed to be a reverse [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one-third when compared to traditional arenas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pengrowthsaddledome.com/b_design.html |title=Building Design |publisher=Saddledome Foundation |accessdate=2008-10-21}}</ref>  When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped.

The winning name in the contest, ''Olympic Saddledome'', was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle-themed names.<ref name="Herald25thP1" />

The designers won several architectural and engineering awards for their work on the Saddledome,<ref name="Herald25thP1" /> and were honoured by the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] at its millennium celebration of architecture in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.ab.ca/pages/public/csaa/csaa-30.aspx |title=Olympic Saddledome |publisher=Alberta Association of Architects |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> The Saddledome is believed to remain the world record holder for the longest spanning hyperbolic paraboloid concrete shell,<ref name="Herald25thP1" /> and was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' on September 27, 1987.<ref>{{cite journal  |title=Welcoming the world |work=Time Magazine |date=1987-09-27 |page=cover |issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

The location of the Saddledome within Stampede Park allows for easy access to Calgary's [[C-Train]] light rail transit system via the [[Victoria Park/Stampede (C-Train)|Victoria Park/Stampede station]] that stands parallel to [[Macleod Trail (Calgary)|Macleod Trail]].  The C-Train station, BMO Centre, Stampede Corral and Saddledome are all connected via a [[+15|Plus 15]] pedestrian [[skyway]]. Direct vehicle access is gained from the north via 5th Street East or Olympic Way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premier.alberta.ca/royalvisit/images/StampedeParkMap.pdf |format=PDF |title=Stampede Park map |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:PengrowthSaddledomeNight.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Saddledome and Calgary skyline at night]]
The arena was initially projected to cost $60 million to build,<ref name="ConstructionStart" /> and later revised to over $80 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saddledome's a cinch to please |work=Calgary Herald |date=1983-10-15 |page=G1}}</ref> Attempts to fast track construction resulted in a $16 million cost overrun, resulting in a final cost of $97.7 million and an eight month delay in its completion.<ref name="Herald25thP1" />  Builders faced delays while building the roof as numerous adjustments were required to fit the giant concrete slabs between the array of cables that held them in place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gu8gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AHMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1274,5728567 |title=Calgary Saddledome: 10 months overdue, $16.5 million over |work=New London Day |date=1983-09-20 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |page=38}}</ref> Upset with the excess cost, [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] politicians in Alberta demanded a public hearing into the issue.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rose |first=Michael |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SRUyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5761,2892000 |title=Calgary Olympics: Trying to avoid Montreal's example |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1983-07-30 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |page=B5}}</ref>  A hearing conducted by the city placed much of the blame on the project manager, while the city and province were required to pay the additional costs.<ref>{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Jeff |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-zA0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=MPUIAAAAIBAJ&pg=1642,2979213 |title=Report questions Olympic chief's competence |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=1984-10-16 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |page=C1}}</ref>

When it opened on October 15, 1983, the Olympic Saddledome served to boost the morale of a city that was experiencing a significant downturn as a result of the international oil market collapse, high interest rates, and the federal government's [[National Energy Policy]].<ref name="Herald25thP1" />  During the first event, an NHL game between the Flames and the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the standard of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] was the first thing booed by a population upset with the government's policies.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Larry |title=Glass, pigeons crash opening clambake |work=Calgary Herald |date=1983-10-16 |page=E1}}</ref> The Oilers defeated the Flames 4<U+2013>3 in front of a sold out crowd of nearly 17,000 fans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Duhatschek |first=Eric |title=Saddledome infested with 'Rat' |work=Calgary Herald |page=E1 |date=1983-10-16}}</ref>

The initial seating capacity was 16,605 for hockey as the upper loges were not immediately completed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mummery |first=Bob |title=Countdown to the Stanley Cup |page=39 |publisher=Polestar Book Publishers |year=1989 |id=ISBN 0-919591-48-5}}</ref>  As the Olympics neared, the Calgary organizing committee spent $1 million to add over 2,600 seats to the upper loges in a bid to alleviate a scandal that resulted from the organizing committee giving its partners and sponsors preferential treatment in ticket sales.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Reed |first=J.D. |title=Games on the range |work=Time Magazine |date=1987-09-27 |page=17 |issn=0040-781X}}</ref> The Saddledome reached its highest capacity in time for the Olympics at 20,016.  The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] noted that it was the largest arena ever used at the Winter Games, and called the facility "the finest international rink in the world"<ref>{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Canada's Olympic Hockey History 1920<U+2013>2010 |publisher=Fenn Publishing |location=Toronto |page=149 |id=ISBN 1-55168-323-7}}</ref> The [[International Olympic Committee]] praised the city's commitment to hosting the Olympics, noting in its official report that constructing the arena prior to being awarded the Games lent credibility to Calgary's bid and positively influenced voters.<ref name="Herald25thP1" /> 

The Flames petitioned the City of Calgary and the Saddledome Foundation to upgrade the facility in 1994, requesting renovations to add additional luxury boxes and a new club section.  The Flames insisted the upgrades were necessary for the team to remain viable in the arena. They argued it was important that their landlord bring the arena up to the higher standards they felt was required.<ref name="MovingThreat">{{cite news |title=Moving never option, Doc Seaman claims |work=Calgary Herald |date=1994-08-09 |page=A1}}</ref>  The team lobbied City Council in the hope it would agree to fund the majority of the $18 million renovation using federal infrastructure funds.

[[Image:Pengrowth Saddledome lacrosse.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the Saddledome during a [[Calgary Roughnecks]] game]]
Renovations occurred between 1994 and 1995 and saw the addition of 41 new luxury suites at the top of the lower bowl, an 1,172 seat club section, a new restaurant, expanded offices for the Flames, Saddledome management and [[Hockey Canada]], as well as a significant restructuring of the public concourse and a new parkade structure.<ref name="DomeImprovement">{{cite news |title=Dome improvement |work=Calgary Sun |date=1994-03-20 |page=17}}</ref>  The arena remained operational until the spring of 1995 despite ongoing construction, but was closed entirely between April and October 1995.<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Monte |title=It's chaos, but the shows go on |work=Calgary Herald |date=1994-08-10 |page=A1}}</ref> The Saddledome officially re-opened on October 25, 1995 for the Flames' first home game of the [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season]].<ref name="FlamesHistory">{{cite web |url=http://flames.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=40685 |title=Flames history |publisher=Calgary Flames Hockey Club |accessdate=2010-01-20}}</ref>

Prior to its re-opening, the Flames signed a deal with [[Canadian Airlines]] to rename the facility.  Under a 20-year agreement worth approximately $1 million per year, the arena became the Canadian Airlines Saddledome. Removing the "Olympic" moniker was controversial with both the public and City Council, though the city voted in favour of the deal which included the donation of a portion of the naming rights to fund amateur sports within the city.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dolik |first=Helen |title=Deal made to rename 'Dome |work=Calgary Herald |date=1995-07-19 |page=A1}}</ref> The arena was renamed again in 2000 when Canadian Airlines was acquired by [[Air Canada]] and ceased operations. [[Pengrowth Energy Trust|Pengrowth Management Ltd.]] signed a ten-year agreement that gave the facility its current name of Pengrowth Saddledome.<ref>{{cite web |last=Francis |first=Eric |url=http://www.canoe.ca/HockeyCalgaryArchive/jun30_tha.html |title=That's the ticket! |work=Calgary Sun |date=2000-06-30 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref>

The arena has received cosmetic upgrades in recent years. In 2004, the Flames spent $1 million on a [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] "power ring" display that lines the facing of the second level, and in 2006 replaced the [[JumboTron]] that was installed in 1995 with a new [[High-definition video|high definition]] scoreboard.<ref name="newScoreboard">{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=58c4dfd1-dd93-408a-805d-479342340ac5&k=76617 |title=Lights out for JumboTron |work=Calgary Herald |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> Manufactured by [[Daktronics]], the display has 12 screens and two LED ribbons,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daktronics.com/ProductsServices/PhotoGallery/Pages/default.aspx?photoID=WP-13088&keywords=Saddledome&filters= |title=Photo Gallery <U+2013> Saddledome |publisher=Daktronics |accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> and is called the [[Enmax]] Energy Board.<ref name="newScoreboard" />

==Saddledome Foundation==
The City of Calgary established the Saddledome Foundation in 1983 and leased the arena for 50-years to the non-profit organization.  Its mandate was to "oversee the operation in a manner that protects taxpayers and benefits amateur sports at the local, provincial and national level".<ref name="DomeImprovement" /> The foundation is made up of a board of nine directors: three appointed by the city, three appointed by the province, and one each appointed by the Calgary Olympic Development Association (now [[Canadian Winter Sport Institute|WinSport Canada]]), Hockey Canada and the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede.<ref name="SF">{{cite web |url=http://www.pengrowthsaddledome.com/foundmain.html |title=Saddledome Foundation |publisher=Saddledome Foundation |accessdate=2010-01-20}}</ref> The foundation contracted the Stampede to manage the arena, and through its lease agreements with the Stampede and the Flames, earned 15 percent of gross concession sales, 50 percent of net income from luxury suites and executive seating and investment income on the arena's revenues.<ref name="DomeImprovement" />  The Flames signed a 20-year lease in 1983 that earned them 70 percent of advertising revenues and 90 percent of ticket revenues.  The Stampede earned 85 percent of concession revenues and all revenue from parking.<ref name="DomeImprovement" />

As part of the 1994 deal with the city, the Flames bought out the Stampede's contract for $20 million and took over management of the facility.<ref name="Herald1994deal" /> While the city and Saddledome Foundation paid for the 1994<U+2013>95 renovations, the new agreement required the Flames to pay for future arena maintenance and repairs, as well as any further renovations.<ref name="DomeImprovement" />  The Flames agreed to manage the arena for 20 years and to contribute $14.5 million toward amateur sport in the city over that time.<ref name="Herald1994deal" /> The Saddledome Foundation retains the responsibility of distributing funds to amateur sport. From its inception through 2007, it had allocated over $20 million toward this cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pengrowthsaddledome.com/pdf/AnnualReport2006_07.pdf |title=2005/2006 Board of Director's annual report |publisher=Saddledome Foundation |date=2007 |accessdate-2010-01-20}}</ref>

==Future==
The Saddledome is one of the oldest arenas in the NHL, fueling speculation that it is due to be replaced.<ref name="Herald90412" /> Flames president and chief executive officer Ken King said in 2008 that plans for a new arena were "five to eight years away" creating the expectation that the team hopes to have a new arena built for when their lease expires in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sportak |first=Randy |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Columnists/Sportak/2007/08/23/4440643-sun.html |title=Home sweet 'Dome no more? |work=Calgary Sun |date=2008-08-23 |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref>  Team chairman [[N. Murray Edwards|Murray Edwards]] argues that the ability of the facility to host major events and concerts are growing increasingly limited as the facility ages.  Along with Edwards, sports financial analysts also note that newer arenas generate far more revenues for their teams than the Saddledome does for the Flames.<ref name="Herald90412" />

It is expected that any new arena would also be located either on the Stampede Grounds or elsewhere in downtown Calgary.<ref name="Herald90412" /> While NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] has lobbied on behalf of both the Flames and the Oilers for government support,<ref name="Herald90412" /> Calgary [[Alderman]] John Mar stated that he did not expect the city would support a new arena with taxpayer money.<ref>{{cite news |last=Logan |first=Shawn |title=Timeline frozen for new arena |work=Calgary Sun |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2008-10-23}}</ref> King stated that the Flames have concepts and designs for a new building, but are not ready to release them.<ref name="Herald25thP1" />  Some of the plans being considered for Stampede Park would include lowering the city's [[C-train]] [[light rail transit]] line below ground and run straight into a new facility.<ref name="Herald90412" />
