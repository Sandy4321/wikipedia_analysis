The '''International System of Units''' (abbreviated '''SI''' from {{lang-fr|Le Syst<U+00E8>me international d'unit<U+00E9>s}}) is the modern form of the [[metric system]] and is the world's most widely used [[Systems of measurement|system of measurement]], used in both everyday [[commerce]] and [[science]]. It comprises a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system of [[units of measurement]] built around seven [[SI base unit|base units]], 22 named and an indeterminate number of unnamed coherent [[SI derived unit|derived units]], and a set of [[Metric prefix|prefixes]] that act as decimal-based multipliers. 

The standards, published in 1960 as the result of an initiative started in 1948, are based on the [[Mks system of units|metre<U+2013>kilogram<U+2013>second]] (MKS) system, rather than the [[Centimetre<U+2013>gram<U+2013>second system of units|centimetre<U+2013>gram<U+2013>second]] (CGS) system, which, in turn, had several variants. The SI has been declared to be an evolving system; thus prefixes and units are created and unit definitions are modified through international agreement as the technology of measurement progresses, and as the precision of measurements improves.

The driving force behind the development of the ''Syst<U+00E8>me international'' was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the [[Centimetre<U+2013>gram<U+2013>second system of units|CGS system of units]] and the lack of coordination between the various [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] that made extensive use of [[units of measurement]]. In addition to defining a new realisation of the metric system, the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]], an organisation set up by the [[Convention of the Metre]] in 1875, succeeded in bringing together many [[international organization]]s to agree not only the definitions of the SI, but also rules on writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the globe.

The system has been [[Metrication|adopted]] by most countries in the developed ([[OECD]]) world, though within English-speaking countries, the adoption has not been universal. In the United States [[Metrication in the United States|metric units are not commonly used]] outside of [[science]], medicine and the government; however, [[United States customary units]] are officially defined in terms of SI units. The United Kingdom has officially adopted a [[Metrication in the United Kingdom|partial metrication]] policy, with no intention of replacing imperial units entirely. [[Metrication in Canada|Canada]] has adopted it for most governmental and scientific purposes, but [[imperial units]] are still legally permitted and remain in common use throughout many sectors of Canadian society, particularly in the buildings, trades and railways sectors.

The [[metric system]] was first implemented during the [[French Revolution]] (1790s) with just the [[metre]] and [[kilogram]] as [[Standard (metrology)|standards]] of [[length]] and [[mass]]<ref group=Note>The [[Mass versus weight|differences between "weight" and "mass"]] were only formally qualified in 1901.</ref> respectively. In the 1830s [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] laid the foundations for a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]] system based on [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]]. In the 1860s a group working under the auspices of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] formulated the requirement for a coherent system of units with [[SI base unit|base units]] and [[SI derived unit|derived units]]. The inclusion of [[Electricity|electrical units]] into the system was hampered by the customary use of more than one set of units, until 1900 when [[Giovanni Giorgi]] identified the need to define one single electrical quantity as a fourth base quantity alongside the original three base quantities. 

Meanwhile, in 1875, the [[Treaty of the Metre]] passed responsibility for verification of the kilogram and metre against agreed prototypes from French to international control. In 1921 the Treaty was extended to include all [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] including electrical units originally defined in 1893. 

In 1948 an overhaul of the metric system was set in motion which resulted in the development of the "Practical system of units" which, on its publication in 1960, was given the name "The International System of Units". In 1954 the 10th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) identified [[electric current]] as the fourth base quantity in the practical system of units and added two more base quantities<U+2014>[[temperature]] and [[luminous intensity]]<U+2014>making six base quantities in all. The units associated with these quantities were the metre, kilogram, [[second]], [[ampere]], [[Kelvin|degree Kelvin]] and [[candela]]. In 1971 a seventh base quantity, [[amount of substance]] represented by the [[Mole (unit)|mole]], was added to the definition of SI. 

===Uncoordinated development===
The [[metric system]] was developed from 1791 onwards by a committee of the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Acad<U+00E9>mie des sciences]]'' commissioned by the ''[[Assemblee Nationale|Assembl<U+00E9>e nationale]]'' and [[Louis XVI]] of France to create a unified and rational system of measures.<ref>{{Cite web

On 30 March 1791, the ''Assembl<U+00E9>e'' adopted the principles proposed by the committee for the new decimal system of measure and authorized a survey between [[Dunkirk]] and [[Barcelona]] to establish the length of the meridian. On 11 July 1792, the committee proposed the names "''[[metre]]''", "''[[hectare|are]]''", "''[[litre]]''"  and "''[[grave (unit)|grave]]''" for the units of length, area, capacity and mass respectively. The committee also proposed that multiples and submultiples of these units were to be denoted by decimal-based prefixes such as "centi-" to denote "one hundredth" and "kilo-" to denote "one thousand".<ref name=Tavernor>{{cite book

The law of 7 April 1795 ({{cite French law|date in French=18 germinal|lower case=yes}}) defined the terms ''[[gram]]me'' and ''[[kilogram]]me'', which replaced the former terms ''gravet'' (correctly ''milligrave'') and ''[[grave (unit)|grave]]'', and on 22 June 1799, after [[Pierre M<U+00E9>chain]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Delambre]] completed the meridian survey, the definitive standards, the ''[[History of the metre#M<U+00E8>tre des Archives|m<U+00E8>tre des Archives]]'' and the ''[[kilogram#Kilogramme des Archives|kilogramme des Archives]]'' were deposited in the [[Archives nationales (France)|''Archives nationales'']].

During the first half of the nineteenth century there was little consistency in the choice of preferred multiples of the base units <U+2013> typically the myriametre ({{gaps|10|000}}&nbsp;metres) was in widespread use in both France and parts of Germany, while the kilogram (1000 grams) rather than the myriagram was used for mass.<ref name=Europa1842/>

In 1832 [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], assisted by [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]], implicitly defined the second as a base unit when he quoted the earth's magnetic field in terms of millimetres, grams, and seconds.<ref name=SIHistory>{{cite web

The technique used by Gauss was to equate the [[torque]] induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the earth<U+2019>s magnetic field with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity. The resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass, length and time to the magnetic field.<ref>{{cite journal

In the 1860s [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (later Lord Kelvin) and others working under the auspices of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a coherent system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the [[Centimetre<U+2013>gram<U+2013>second system of units|centimetre<U+2013>gram<U+2013>second (CGS) system of units]] (CGS), including the [[erg]] for [[energy]], the [[dyne]] for [[force]], the [[barye]] for [[pressure]], the [[poise]] for [[Viscosity|dynamic viscosity]] and the [[Stokes (unit)|stokes]] for [[Viscosity|kinematic viscosity]].<ref name=BIPMCentenary>{{cite book

All these units incorporate [[standard gravity]] in their definitions.

At the end of the [[Second World War]], a number of different systems of measurement were in use throughout the world. Some of these systems were metric system variations, whereas others were based on [[Systems of measurement|customary systems]] of measure. After representations by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) and by the French Government, the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures ([[CGPM]]), in 1948, asked the International Committee for Weights and Measures ([[CIPM]]) to conduct an international study of the measurement needs of the scientific, technical, and educational communities and "to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention".<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/6/ 9th CGPM (1948): Resolution 6]</ref>

On the basis of the findings of this study, the 10th CGPM in 1954 decided that an international system should be derived from six base units to provide for the measurement of temperature and optical radiation in addition to mechanical and [[SI electromagnetism units|electromagnetic]] quantities. Six base units were recommended: the [[metre]], [[kilogram]], [[second]], [[ampere]], degree Kelvin (later renamed [[kelvin]]), and [[candela]]. In 1960, the 11th CGPM named the system the ''International System of Units'', abbreviated SI from the French name, {{lang|fr|''Le Syst<U+00E8>me international d'unit<U+00E9>s''}}.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|110}}<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/11/12/ 11th CGPM (1960): Resolution 12]</ref> The BIPM has also described SI as "the modern metric system".<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|95}} The seventh base unit, the [[mole (unit)|mole]], was added in 1971 by the 14th CGPM.<ref>[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/14/3/ 14th CGPM (1971):Resolution 3]</ref>

The CGPM have published a brochure, the 8th edition of which appeared in 2006, in which the various recommendations that make up SI have been codified.<ref name=SIBrochure>{{SIBrochure8th}}</ref> The official version of the brochure, in line with the provisions of the [[Metre Convention]], is the [[French language|French]] version.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|102}} This brochure leaves some scope for local interpretation, particularly in respect of language. The United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] has produced a version of the CGPM document (NIST SP 330)  which clarifies local interpretation for English-language publications that use [[American English]]<ref name=NIST330>{{Cite book

and it is expected that the CGPM will consider the full proposal in 2014.

The definitions of the terms "quantity", "unit", "dimension" etc. that are used in the ''SI Brochure'' are those given in the [[International vocabulary of metrology|International Vocabulary of Metrology]], a publication produced by the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM), a working group consisting of eight international standards organisations under the chairmanship of the director of the BIPM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/guides/vim.html|title=The International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM)}}</ref> The quantities and equations that define the SI units are now referred to as the ''International System of Quantities'' (ISQ), and are set out in the ''[[ISO/IEC 80000|ISO/IEC 80000 Quantities and Units]]''.

Appendix B of ''NIST SP 811'', a list of [[Conversion of units|conversion factors]] between SI and customary units, is an extension to the ''SI Brochure''.<ref name=NIST811/>

==Units and prefixes==
The International System of Units consists of a set of [[SI base unit|base units]], a set of  [[SI derived unit|derived units]] with special names, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as [[SI prefix|prefixes]].  The term "SI Units" includes all three categories, but the term "coherent SI units" includes only base units and coherent derived units.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|103<U+2013>106}} 

===Base units===
{{Main|SI base unit}}

[[SI base unit|Base units]] are the building blocks of SI <U+2013> all other units of measure can be derived from the base units. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units <U+2013> [[mass]], [[length]] and [[time]]. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit <U+2013> theoretically [[electrical current]], [[potential difference]], [[electrical resistance]], [[electrical charge]] or any one of a number of other units could have been used as the base unit, with the remaining units being then defined by the [[laws of physics]] <U+2013> the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. The remaining three base units were added later.

===Derived units===
{{Main|SI derived unit}}
[[SI derived unit|Derived units]] are formed by powers, products or quotients of the base units and are unlimited in number;<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|103}}<ref name=NIST330/>{{rp|3}} Derived units are associated with derived quantities, for example [[velocity]] is a quantity that is derived from the base quantities of time and distance which, in SI, has the dimensions metres per second (symbol m/s). The dimensions of derived units can be expressed in terms of the dimensions of the base units. 

Coherent units are derived units that contain no numerical factor other than 1<U+2014>quantities such as [[standard gravity]] and [[density of water]] are absent from their definitions. In the example above, ''one'' newton is the force required to [[accelerate]] a mass of ''one'' kilogram by ''one'' [[metre per second squared]]. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m<U+22C5>s<sup><U+2212>2</sup> respectively and {{math|''F'' <U+221D> ''m'' <U+00D7> ''a''}}, the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg<U+22C5>m<U+22C5>s<sup><U+2212>2</sup>. Since the newton is part of a coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.

For the sake of convenience, some derived units have special names and symbols.<ref name=special>{{cite journal

For example, the SI unit of [[force]] is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (N), the SI unit of [[pressure]] is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa)<U+2014>and the pascal can be defined as "newtons per square metre" (N/m<sup>2</sup>).<ref>{{cite web

===Prefixes===
{{Main|Metric prefix}}
[[metric prefix|Prefixes]] are added to unit names to produce multiple and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, ''kilo-'' denotes a multiple of a thousand and ''milli-'' denotes a multiple of a thousandth; hence there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, and multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit. Thus a millionth of a metre is a ''micrometre'', not a millimillimetre, and a millionth of a kilogram is a ''milligram'', not a microkilogram.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|122}}<ref name=NIST811/>{{rp|14}}

===Non-SI units accepted for use with SI===
{{Main|non-SI units accepted for use with SI}}
Although, in theory, SI can be used for any physical measurement, the CIPM has recognised that some non-SI units still appear in the scientific, technical and commercial literature, and will continue to be used for many years to come.  In addition, certain other units are so deeply embedded in the history and culture of the human race that they will continue to be used for the foreseeable future. They have catalogued a number of such [[non-SI units accepted for use with SI]] and published them in the SI Brochure, thereby ensuring that their use is consistent across the globe. These units have been grouped as follows:<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|123<U+2013>129}}<ref name=NIST811/>{{rp|7<U+2013>11}}  <ref group = Note>This grouping and the reference to Tables 6, 7, 8 and 9 reflects the 8th Edition of the SI Brochure (2006)</ref>

[[File:CubeLitre.svg|pic|right|thumb|The litre is classed as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI.<br>Being one thousandth of a cubic metre, the litre is not a coherent unit of measure with respect to SI.]]
*'''Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI''' (Table 6):
:Certain units of time, angles and legacy non-SI metric units have a long history of consistent use.  Most of mankind has used the day and its non-decimal subdivisions as a basis of time and, unlike the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], these were the same regardless of where they were being measured.  The [[radian]], being {{sfrac|1|2<U+03C0>}} of a revolution has mathematical niceties, but it is cumbersome for navigation, and, as with time, the units used in navigation have a large degree of consistency around the world. The [[tonne]], [[litre]] and [[hectare]] were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols.  The catalogued units are
::[[minute]], [[hour]], [[day]], [[Degree (angle)|degree of arc]], [[minute|minute of arc]], [[Minute of arc|second of arc]], [[hectare]], [[litre]] and [[tonne]]

* '''Non-SI units whose values in SI units must be obtained experimentally''' (Table 7).
:Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena, particularly when the quantities associated with these phenomena are many orders of magnitude greater than or less than the equivalent SI unit.  The most common ones have been catalogued in the SI Brochure together with consistent symbols and accepted values, but with the caveat that their physical values need to be measured.<ref group = Note>The CGPM have defined the metre in terms of the speed of light, so the speed of light has an exact value.</ref>
::[[electronvolt]], [[Atomic mass unit|dalton/unified atomic mass unit]], [[astronomical unit]], [[speed of light]], [[Planck constant]] and [[electron mass]]

* '''Other non-SI units''' (Table 8):
:A number of non-SI units that had never been formally sanctioned by the CGPM have continued to be used across the globe in many spheres including [[health care]] and [[navigation]]. As with the units of measure in Tables 6 and 7, these have been catalogued by the CIPM in the SI Brochure to ensure consistent usage, but with the recommendation that authors who use them should define them wherever they are used.
::[[Bar (unit)|bar]], [[millimetre of mercury]], [[Angstrom|<U+00E5>ngstr<U+00F6>m]], [[nautical mile]], [[Barn (unit)|barn]], [[knot (unit)|knot]], [[neper]] and [[Decibel|[deci]bel]]

* '''Non-SI units associated with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of units''' (Table 9)
:The SI manual also catalogues a number of legacy units of measure that are used in specific fields such as [[geodesy]] and [[geophysics]] or are found in the literature, particularly in [[Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field#Curved spacetime|classical and relativistic electrodynamics]] where they have certain advantages: The units that are catalogued are:
::[[erg]], [[dyne]], [[poise]], [[Stokes (unit)|stokes]], [[Stilb (unit)|stilb]], [[phot]], [[Gal (unit)|gal]], [[Maxwell (unit)|maxwell]], [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]] and [[oersted|<U+0153>rsted]].

==Writing unit symbols and the values of quantities {{anchor|SI_writing_style}}==
Before 1948, the writing of metric quantities was haphazard. In 1879, the CIPM published recommendations for writing the symbols for length, area, volume and mass, but it was outside its domain to publish recommendations for other quantities. Beginning in about 1900, physicists who had been using the symbol "<U+03BC>" for "micrometre" (or "micron"), "<U+03BB>" for "microlitre", and "<U+03B3>" for "microgram" started to use the symbols "<U+03BC>m", "<U+03BC>L" and "<U+03BC>g", but it was only in 1935, a decade after the revision of the [[Metre Convention]] that the CIPM formally adopted this proposal and recommended that the symbol "<U+03BC>" be used universally as a prefix for {{val|e=-6}}.<ref>{{cite book

===Unit names===
Names of [[units of measurement|units]] follow the grammatical rules associated with [[common noun]]s: in English and in French they start with a lowercase letter (e.g., newton, hertz, pascal), even when the symbol for the unit begins with a capital letter. This also applies to "degrees Celsius", since "degree" is the unit. In German, however, the names of units, as with all German nouns, start with capital letters.<ref>{{cite book

Likewise, the plural forms of units follow the [[grammar]] of the language concerned: in English, the normal rules of [[English grammar]] are used, e.g. "henries" is the plural of "[[Henry (unit)|henry]]". <ref name=NISTInterprepation>{{Cite journal

</ref>  <ref name=NIST811/>{{rp|31}} However, the units [[lux]], [[hertz]], and [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] have [[English plural|irregular plurals]] in that they remain the same in both their singular and plural form.

In English, when unit names are combined to denote multiplication of the units concerned, they are separated with a [[hyphen]] or a space (e.g. newton-metre or newton metre).  The plural is formed by converting the last unit name to the plural form (e.g. ten newton-metres).

===Chinese and Japanese===
[[Image:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|[[China|Chinese]] expressway distances [[Expressways of Beijing|road]] sign in eastern [[Beijing]]. Although the primary text is in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the distances use the internationally recognised [[numerical digit|numerals]] and [[symbol (formal)|symbols]].]]
[[Chinese language|Chinese]] uses traditional [[logogram]]s for writing the unit names, while in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] unit names are written in the phonetic katakana script; in both cases [[symbol]]s are written using the internationally recognised [[Latin characters|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek characters]].

;Japanese
A set of [[Kanji|characters]] representing various metric units was [[kokuji|created in Japan]] in the [[Meiji period|late 19th century]]. Characters exist for three base units: the metre ({{lang|ja|<U+7C73>}}), litre ({{lang|ja|<U+5347>}}) and gram ({{lang|ja|<U+514B>}}). These were combined with a set of six prefix characters <U+2013> ''kilo-'' ({{lang|ja|<U+5343>}}), ''hecto-'' ({{lang|ja|<U+767E>}}), ''deca-'' ({{lang|ja|<U+5341>}}), ''deci-'' ({{lang|ja|<U+5206>}}), ''centi-'' ({{lang|ja|<U+5398>}}) and ''milli-'' ({{lang|ja|<U+6BDB>}}) <U+2013> to form an additional 18 single-character units. The seven length units (kilometre to millimetre), for example, are {{lang|ja|<U+7C81>, <U+7CA8>, <U+7C75>, <U+7C73>, <U+7C89>, <U+7CCE>}} and {{lang|ja|<U+7C8D>}}. These characters, however, are not in common use today; instead, units are written out in [[katakana]], the Japanese [[syllabary]] used for foreign borrowings, such as {{lang|ja|<U+30AD><U+30ED><U+30E1><U+30FC><U+30C8><U+30EB>}} ''{{lang|ja-Latn|kirom<U+0113>toru}}'' for "kilometer". A few Sino-Japanese words for these units remain in use in Japanese, most significantly {{lang|ja|<U+5E73><U+7C73>}} ''{{lang|ja-Latn|heibei}}'' "square meter", but otherwise borrowed pronunciations are used.

These characters are examples of the rare phenomenon of [[Ateji#Single-character loan words|single-character loan words]] <U+2013> a foreign word represented by a single Japanese character <U+2013> and form the plurality of such words. Similar characters were also coined for other units, such as British units, though these also have fallen out of use; see [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo#Metric units|Single character gairaigo: Metric units]] and [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo#Other units|Single character gairaigo: Other units]] for a full list.

;Chinese
The basic units are metre ({{lang|zh|<U+7C73>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|m<U+01D0>}}''), litre ({{lang|zh|<U+5347>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|sh<U+0113>ng}}''), gram ({{lang|zh|<U+514B>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|k<U+00E8>}}''), and second ({{lang|zh|<U+79D2>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|mi<U+01CE>o}}''), while others include watt ({{lang|zh|<U+74E6>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|w<U+01CE>}}''). Prefixes include ''deci-'' ({{lang|zh|<U+5206>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|f<U+0113>n}}''), ''centi-'' ({{lang|zh|<U+5398>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|l<U+00ED>}}''), ''milli-'' ({{lang|zh|<U+6BEB>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|h<U+00E1>o}}''), ''micro-'' ({{lang|zh|<U+5FAE>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|w<U+0113>i}}''), and ''kilo-'' ({{lang|zh|<U+5343>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|qi<U+0101>n}}''). These are combined to form disyllabic characters, such as {{lang|zh|<U+5398><U+7C73>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|l<U+00ED>m<U+01D0>}}'' 'centimeter' or {{lang|zh|<U+5343><U+74E6>}} ''{{lang|zh-Latn|qi<U+0101>nw<U+01CE>}}'' 'kilowatt'.<ref>{{cite web

===Unit symbols and the values of quantities {{anchor|SI_writing_style}}===
Although the writing of unit names is language-specific, the writing of unit symbols and the values of quantities is consistent across all languages and therefore the SI Brochure has specific rules in respect of writing them.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|130<U+2013>135}} The guideline produced by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)<ref name='nist style'>
{{Cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec07.html |title=NIST Guide to SI Units&nbsp;<U+2013> Rules and Style Conventions |accessdate=2009-12-29|last1=Thompson|first1=A.|date=July 2008 |last2=Taylor |first2=B. N. |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology }}</ref> clarifies language-specific areas in respect of American English that were left open by the SI Brochure, but is otherwise identical to the SI Brochure.<ref name=NISTInterprepation/>

====General rules====
General rules<ref name=generalrules group=Note>Except where specifically noted, these rules are common to both the SI Brochure and the NIST brochure.</ref> for writing SI units and quantities apply to text that is either handwritten or produced using an automated process:
* The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21&nbsp;kg, {{val|7.3|e=2|u=m<sup>2</sup>}}, 22&nbsp;K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp |134}} and the symbol for degrees of temperature (&deg;C).<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp| 133}} Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (&deg;,&nbsp;&prime;, and&nbsp;&Prime;), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.
* Symbols are mathematical entities, not abbreviations, and as such do not have an appended period/full stop (.), unless the rules of grammar demand one for another reason, such as denoting the end of a sentence.
* A prefix is part of the unit, and its symbol is prepended to the unit symbol without a separator (e.g., k in km, M in MPa, G in GHz). Compound prefixes are not allowed.
* Symbols for derived units formed by multiplication are joined with a [[dot operator|centre dot]] (&middot;) or a non-breaking space; e.g., N&middot;m or N&nbsp;m.
* Symbols for derived units formed by division are joined with a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (/), or given as a negative [[exponent]]. E.g., the "metre per second" can be written m/s, m&nbsp;s<sup><U+2212>1</sup>, m&middot;s<sup><U+2212>1</sup>, or {{sfrac|m|s}}. Only one solidus should be used; e.g., kg/(m&middot;s<sup>2</sup>) and kg&middot;m<sup><U+2212>1</sup>&middot;s<sup><U+2212>2</sup> are acceptable, but kg/m/s<sup>2</sup> is ambiguous and unacceptable.
[[File:981ms2.png|thumb|Acceleration due to gravity.<br>Note the lowercase letters (neither "metres" nor "seconds" were named after people), the space between the value and the units, and the superscript "2" to denote "squared".]]
* The first letter of symbols for units derived from the name of a person is written in [[upper case]]; otherwise, they are written in [[lower case]]. E.g., the unit of [[pressure]] is named after [[Blaise Pascal]], so its symbol is written "Pa", but the symbol for mole is written "mol". Thus, "T" is the symbol for [[tesla (unit)|tesla]], a measure of [[magnetic field strength]], and "t" the symbol for [[tonne]], a measure of [[mass]]. Since 1979, the [[litre]] may exceptionally be written using either an uppercase "L" or a lowercase "l", a decision prompted by the similarity of the lowercase letter "l" to the numeral "1", especially with certain typefaces or English-style handwriting. The American NIST recommends that within the United States "L" be used rather than "l".
* Symbols of units do not have a plural form; e.g., 25&nbsp;kg, not 25&nbsp;{{notatypo|kgs}}.
* Uppercase and lowercase prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., the quantities 1&nbsp;mW and 1&nbsp;MW represent two different quantities; the former is the typical power requirement of a hearing aid (1 milliwatt or 0.001 watts), and the latter the typical power requirement of a suburban train (1 megawatt or {{gaps|1|000|000}} watts).
* The 10th resolution of [[CGPM]] in 2003 declared that "the symbol for the [[Decimal separator|decimal marker]] shall be either the [[full stop|point]] on the line or the [[comma]] on the line." In practice, the decimal point is used in English-speaking countries and most of Asia, and the comma in most of [[Latin America]] and in continental [[Languages of Europe|European languages]].<ref>{{cite journal

* Spaces should be used as a [[thousands separator]] ({{gaps|1|000|000}}) in contrast to commas or periods (1,000,000 or 1.000.000) to reduce confusion resulting from the variation between these forms in different countries.
* Any line-break inside a number, inside a compound unit, or between number and unit should be avoided.  Where this is not possible, line breaks should coincide with thousands separators.
* Since the value of "billion" and "trillion" can [[Long and short scales|vary from language to language]], the dimensionless terms "ppb" (parts per [[Billion (word)|billion]]) and "ppt" (parts per [[long and short scales|trillion]]) should be avoided.  However, no alternative is suggested in the SI Brochure.

====Printing SI symbols====
Further rules<ref name=generalrules group=Note/> are specified in respect of production of text using [[printing press]]es, [[word processor]]s, [[typewriter]]s and the like.
* Symbols are written in upright ([[Roman type|Roman]]) type (m for metres, s for seconds), so as to differentiate from the [[italic type]] used for quantities (''m'' for mass, ''s'' for displacement). By consensus of international standards bodies, this rule is applied independent of the font used for surrounding text.
* In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language]] computing ([[CJK characters|CJK]]), some of the commonly used units, prefix<U+2013>unit combinations, or unit<U+2013>exponent combinations have been allocated predefined single characters taking up a full square. [[Unicode]] includes these in its [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3300.pdf CJK Compatibility] and [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2100.pdf letter-like symbols] sub-ranges for back compatibility, without necessarily recommending future usage. These are summarised in [[Unicode symbols]]. The cursive <U+2113>, a letter-like symbol, has been used in a number of countries in addition to China and Japan as a symbol for the litre, but this is not currently recommended by any [[Standards organization|standards body]].<!--there are lots of standards organisations and I'm pretty sure at least some of them did recommend this in the past; I think South Africa was also big on this-->
*[[Space (punctuation)|In print]], the space used as a thousands separator (commonly called a [[thin space]]) is typically narrower than that used between words.

==Realisation of units==
[[File:Silicon sphere for Avogadro project.jpg|thumb|upright|Silicon sphere for the [[Avogadro constant#International Avogadro Coordination|Avogadro project]] used for measuring the Avogadro constant to a relative uncertainty of 2{{e|<U+2212>8}} or less.<ref>{{cite web| title = Avogadro Project | url = http://www.npl.co.uk/engineering-measurements/mass-force-pressure/mass/research/avogadro-project | publisher = National Physical Laboratory | accessdate = 2010-08-19}}</ref>]]
Metrologists carefully distinguish between the definition of a unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the ''mise en pratique''<ref group = Note name=Translation>This term is a [[#Metre Convention|translation]] of the official [French] text of the SI Brochure</ref> of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref><ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|168<U+2013>169}} 

The published ''mise en pratique'' is not the only way in which a base unit can be determined: the SI Brochure states that "any method consistent with the laws of physics could be used to realise any SI unit."<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|111}} In the current (2012) exercise to [[New SI definitions|overhaul the definitions of the base units]], various consultative committees of the CIPM have required that more than one ''mise en pratique'' shall be developed for determining the value of each unit.  In particular:
* At least three separate experiments be carried out yielding values having a relative standard uncertainty in the determination of the [[kilogram]] of no more than {{val|5|e=-8}} and at least one of these values should be better than {{val|2|e=-8}}.  Both the [[Watt balance]] and the [[Avogadro constant#International Avogadro Coordination|Avogadro project]] should be included in the experiments and any differences between these be reconciled.<ref>{{cite web

==Post-1960 changes==
The preamble to the [[Metre Convention]] read "''Desiring the international uniformity and precision in standards of weight and measure, have resolved to conclude a convention ..."''.<ref name=ConventionText/> Changing technology has led to an evolution of the definitions and standards that has followed two principal strands <U+2013> changes to SI itself and clarification of how to use units of measure that are not part of SI, but are still nevertheless used on a worldwide basis.

===Changes to the SI===
Since 1960 the CGPM has made a number of changes to SI.  These include:
*The 13th CGPM (1967) renamed the "degree Kelvin" (symbol &deg;K) to the "kelvin" (symbol K)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|156}}
*The 14th CGPM (1971) added the [[Mole (unit)|mole]] (symbol mol) to the list of base units.<ref>pg 221 <U+2013> McGreevy</ref>
*The 14th GCPM (1971) added the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (symbol Pa) for [[pressure]] and the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] (symbol S) for electrical conductance to the list of named derived units.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|156}}
*The 15th CGPM (1975) added the [[becquerel]] (symbol Bq) for "[[Radioactive decay|activity]] referred to a [[radionuclide]]" and the [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (symbol Gy) for ionizing radiation to the list of named derived units<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|156}}
*In order to distinguish between "[[absorbed dose]]" and "[[dose equivalent]]", the 16th CGPM added the [[sievert]] (symbol Sv) to the list of named derived units as the unit of dose equivalent.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|158}}
*The 16th CGPM (1979) clarified that in a break with convention either the letter "L" or the letter "l" may be used as a symbol for the [[litre]].<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|159}}
[[File:Clinical Mercury Manometer.jpg|thumb|[[Sphygmomanometer]] <U+2013> the traditional device that measures blood pressure using [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in a manometer.  Pressures are recorded in "[[Pressure measurement#Liquid column|millimetres of mercury]]" <U+2013> a non-SI unit]]
*The 21st CGPM (1999) added the [[katal]] (symbol kat) for [[catalytic activity]] to the list of named derived units.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|165}} 
*In its original form (1960), the SI defined prefixes for values ranging from pico- (symbol p) having a value of 10<sup><U+2212>12</sup> to tera- (symbol T) having a value of 10<sup>12</sup>. The list was extended at the 12th CGPM (1964),<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|152}} at the 15th CGPM (1975)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|158}} and at the 19th CGPM (1991)<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp|164}} to give the current range of prefixes.

In addition, advantage was taken of developments in technology to redefine many of the base units enabling the use of higher precision techniques.

===Retention of non-SI units===
Although, in theory, SI can be used for any physical measurement, it is recognised that some non-SI units still appear in the scientific, technical and commercial literature, and will continue to be used for many years to come.  In addition, certain other units are so deeply embedded in the history and culture of the human race that they will continue to be used for the foreseeable future. The CIPM has catalogued such units and included them in the SI Brochure so that they can be used consistently.

The first such group comprises the units of time and of angles and certain legacy non-SI metric units.  Most of mankind has used the day and its subdivisions as a basis of time with the result that the second, minute, hour and day, unlike the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]], were the same regardless of where it was being measured. The second has been catalogued as an SI unit, its multiples as units of measure that may be used alongside the SI.  The measurement of angles has likewise had a long history of consistent use <U+2013> the [[radian]], being {{sfrac|2<U+03C0>}} of a revolution, has mathematical niceties, but it is cumbersome for navigation, hence the retention of the degree, minute and second of arc. The [[tonne]], [[litre]] and [[hectare]] were adopted by the CGPM in 1879 and have been retained as units that may be used alongside SI units, having been given unique symbols.

Physicists often use units of measure that are based on natural phenomena such as the speed of light, the mass of a proton (approximately one [[Dalton (unit)|dalton]]), the charge of an electron and the like.  These too have been catalogued in the SI Brochure with consistent symbols, but with the caveat that their physical values need to be measured.<ref group = Note>The CGPM has defined the metre in terms of the speed of light, so the speed of light has an exact value.</ref>

In the interests of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the [[curie]] (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides;<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp| 152}} the becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years.  Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.<ref name=SIBrochure/>{{rp| 127}}

When the SI standard was published in 1960, the only major Commonwealth country to have adopted the metric system was India. In 1863, the first reading of a bill that would have made the metric system compulsory passed its first reading in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by 110 votes to 75. The bill, however, failed to make the statute book because of lack of parliamentary time.<ref name=Tavernor/>{{rp|136}} In 1965, after [[Metrication in the United Kingdom|this and similar false starts]] the then [[Federation of British Industry]] informed the British Government that its members favoured the adoption of the metric system. The rationale behind the request was that 80% of British exports were to countries that used the metric system or that were considering changing to the metric system. The [[Board of Trade]], on behalf of the Government, agreed to support a ten-year metrication programme. The government agreed to a voluntary policy requiring minimal legislation and costs to be borne where they fell. SI would be used from the outset.<ref>{{Cite journal

During the first decade of the 21st century, the [[European Community|EU]] directive [[European units of measurement directives|80/181/EEC]] had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009.

Meanwhile, in 1999 the UPLR was amended to permit metric-only labelling and automatically became law in those states that accept UPLR "as is".

The directive was silent in respect of units that were specific to one or two countries including the ''pond'', ''pfund'', ''livre'' (Dutch, German and French synonyms for 500&nbsp;g), thereby effectively prohibiting their use as well.

The cut-off date for the use of supplementary units was extended a number of times and in 2009 was extended indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1980L0181:20090527:EN:PDF | author = The Council of the European Communities | title = Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to Unit of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC | date=2009-05-27 | accessdate=2009-09-14}}</ref>

===India===
{{Main|Metrication in India}}
[[India]] was one of the last countries to start a metrication programme before the advent of SI. When it became [[Independence|independent]] in 1947, both imperial and [[Indigenous peoples|native]] units of measure were in use. Its metrication programme started in 1956 with the passing of  the Standards of Weights and Measures Act.  Part of the act fixed the value of the [[Seer (unit)|seer]] a legacy unit of mass) to 0.9331&nbsp;kg exactly; elsewhere the Act declared that from 1960 all non-metric units of measure were to be illegal.<ref>{{cite web

Four years after the [[Government of India|Indian Government]] announced its metrication programme, SI was published. The result was that the initial metrication programme was a conversion to the CGS system of units and the subsequent adoption of SI has been haphazard.  Fifty years later, many of the country's [[Textbook|schoolbooks]] still use CGS or imperial units.<ref>{{cite journal

In 1976 a new Weights and Measures Act replaced the 1956 Act which, amongst other things,  required that all [[Weighing scale|weighing devices]] be approved before being released onto the market place. However, in 2012, it was reported that traditional units were still encountered in small manufacturing establishments and in the marketplace alongside CGS, SI and imperial measures, particularly in the poorer areas.<ref>{{cite conference

The use of the [[Indian numbering system]] of [[crore]]s (10,000,000) and [[lakh]]s (100,000), which do not map onto the SI system of prefixes, is widespread and is often found alongside or in place of the [[Western world|western]] numbering system.<ref>{{cite web

=="New SI"==
{{main|New SI definitions}}
[[File:Relations between new SI units definitions.png|thumb|right| Relations between proposed SI units definitions (in colour) and seven [[physical constant]]s (in grey) with fixed numerical values in the proposed system.

Unlike the current (2013) definition, the base units are derived from one or more constants of nature.]]
When the [[History of the metre|metre was redefined]] in 1960, the kilogram was the only SI base unit that relied on a specific artifact and thus the only unit that was subject to "periodic comparisons of national standards with the international prototypes".<ref name=ConventionText/> After the 1996<U+2013>1998 recalibration, a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.

At its 23rd meeting (2007), the CGPM mandated the CIPM to investigate the use of natural constants of nature as the basis for all units of measure rather than the artefacts that were then in use, thus involving a change from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.<ref name=Explicit>{{cite journal

and draft changes to the SI Brochure that were to be presented to the next meeting of the CIPM in October 2010 were agreed to in principle.<ref name="draft"/> The proposals that the CCU put forward were:
*In addition to the speed of light, four constants of nature <U+2013> the [[Planck constant]], an [[elementary charge]], the [[Boltzmann constant]] and the [[Avogadro number]] <U+2013> be defined to have exact values.
*The [[International_Prototype_Kilogram#International_prototype_kilogram|International Prototype Kilogram]] be retired
*The current definitions of the kilogram, [[ampere]], [[kelvin]] and [[Mole (unit)|mole]] be revised.
*The wording of the definitions of all the base units be both tightened up and changed to reflect the change in emphasis from explicit unity to explicit constant definitions.

The CIPM meeting of October 2010 found that "the conditions set by the General Conference at its 23rd meeting have not yet been fully met. For this reason the CIPM does not propose a revision of the SI at the present time".<ref>{{cite web
