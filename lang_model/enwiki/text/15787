'''''Captain Kangaroo''''' is a [[children's television series]] which aired weekday mornings on the American [[television network]] [[CBS]] for nearly thirty years. It aired from October 3, 1955 until December 8, 1984, making it the longest-running children's television program of its day.<ref>"Bob Keesha". ''Encyclopedia Britannica Online''. Retrieved January 2, 2010.</ref><ref>"Keeshan, Robert James."''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives''. Ed. Arnold Markoe, Karen Markoe, and Kenneth T. Jackson. Vol. 7: 2003<U+2013>2005. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2007. Retrieved January 2, 2010.</ref> In 1986, the American Program Service (now [[American Public Television]], Boston) integrated some newly-produced segments into [[reruns]] of past episodes, distributing the newer version of the series until 1993.

The show was conceived and the title character played by [[Bob Keeshan]], who based the show on "the warm relationship between grandparents and children." Keeshan was the original [[Clarabell the Clown]] on ''The [[Howdy Doody]] Show'' when it aired on [[NBC]].

The show had a loose structure, built around life in the "Treasure House" where the Captain (whose name came from the big pockets in his coat) would tell stories, meet guests and indulge in silly stunts with regular characters, both humans and puppets. The show was telecast live for its first four years and was in [[black-and-white]] until 1968. The May 17, 1971 episode saw two major changes on the show; the Treasure House was renovated and renamed "The Captain's Place" and the Captain replaced his black coat with a red coat. In September 1981, CBS shortened the hour-long show to a half-hour, briefly retitled it ''Wake Up with the Captain'', and moved it to an earlier time-slot; the show was later moved to weekends in September 1982, and returned to an hour-long format. It was canceled by CBS at the end of 1984.

In 1997<U+2013>1998, an ''All New Captain Kangaroo'' was attempted by [[Saban Entertainment]]. [[John McDonough]] played the Captain. It was shot in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Keeshan was invited to appear as a special guest called "The Admiral," but after seeing sample episodes, he declined to appear or have any association with the new incarnation. It ran for one season and inspired a spin-off, ''Mister Moose's Fun Time.''

==Cartoons==
A [[cartoon]] starring a funnel-capped shape-shifting boy named ''[[Tom Terrific]]'' was part of the show in the 1950s and 1960s. Tom had a [[sidekick]] named ''Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog,'' and a nemesis, ''Crabby Appleton.'' Other cartoons included ''Lariat Sam,'' which was developed by veteran [[game show]] [[announcer]] [[Gene Wood]], then a show staffer (who also sang the cartoon's theme song).

The Canadian-British cartoon ''[[Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings]]'' appeared in the 1970s, featuring a child with magic chalk who could create all sorts of short-lived creations in short adventures (the original version featured a British narrator, but Keeshan's voice was dubbed onto the cartoons for their US airing.)

The UK-produced cartoon ''[[Ludwig (cartoon)|Ludwig]],'' about a magical egg-shaped robot was also included about that time. The cartoon's musical score consisted of selections from the works of [[Ludwig Van Beethoven|Beethoven]].

Also appearing in the 1970s was ''[[The Most Important Person]]'', a short series of five-minute segments on the importance of life; and ''[[The Kingdom of Could Be You]]'', a short series of five-minute segments on the importance of careers and the work world.

There was also a cartoon series called ''The Toothbrush Family''. Based on an extended family of hygiene utensils as the name suggests, they would embark on adventures based in the bathroom, like water skiing in the tub, or rescuing friends caught in the drain. Episodes were generally a couple of minutes each.

A silent cartoon in the 1970s named ''[[Crystal Tipps and Alistair|Crystal Tipps]]'' featured the adventures of a young girl. Later reruns were narrated by the voice of Mr. Moose. Another British favorite, ''[[The Wombles]]'' were also featured.

The ''[[The Red and the Blue|Red & Blue]]'' shorts from Italy were also shown.

''[[The Undersea Adventures of Captain Nemo]]'', featuring a family of sea explorers, was featured as well.

Re-runs of the ''[[CB Bears]]'' and ''Undercover Elephant'', as well as ''Motormouse'' and ''Autocat'' (of the ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]'') were shown in the 1980s Saturday Morning run.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Special guests==
Among the special guests who made periodic appearances were ventriloquist [[Shari Lewis]] and [[Lamb Chop (puppet)|Lamb Chop]]; Mister Rogers ([[Fred Rogers]]), who appeared in a 1975 episode, where he and the Captain try to restore an old [[phonograph|gramophone]]. Comediennes [[Joan Rivers]], [[Imogene Coca]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Charlotte Rae]], [[Ruth Buzzi]], and [[Minnie Pearl]] made guest appearances, as did opera star [[Roberta Peters]], talk show host [[Phil Donahue]] (in 1978), [[Marlo Thomas]], actor and folk singer [[Theodore Bikel]], game show host [[Bill Cullen]], singers [[Pearl Bailey]] (several appearances), [[Dolly Parton]], and [[John Denver]] and Television performers [[Penny Marshall]], [[Cindy Williams]], [[Lorne Greene]], [[Bonnie Franklin]], [[Andy Griffith]], [[The Smothers Brothers]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Arte Johnson]], [[Fannie Flagg]], [[Gale Gordon]], [[Lucie Arnaz]], [[Ken Berry]], [[Mike Farrell]], [[Dick Shawn]], and [[John Ritter]] as well as [[Eli Wallach]], [[Anne Jackson]], [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Anne Meara]], [[Jack Gilford]], [[Paul Sorvino]], [[Hal Linden]], [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Walter Slezak]], and [[Carol Channing]], plus there were several appearances by [[Alan Arkin]] and one when his son [[Adam Arkin]] played Alan's father.

=="Good Morning Captain!"==
Beginning in the mid-1970s and continuing through the decade, the show would open with several different people wishing the Captain 'good morning.' Many of the openings featured non-celebrities, but also featured stars from TV shows, most of which broadcast over [[CBS]], such as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' and ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', as well as other characters with connection to the network, including [[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]], dressed as [[Captain Kirk]] and [[Mr. Spock]], and characters from the [[Peanuts]] animation cartoons. Fred Rogers from Mister Rogers Neighborhood, was shown saying "Good morning", The montage of 'good mornings' would always end with the Captain himself returning the greeting before the opening credits ran.

==Regular features==
Other regular features included ''The Magic Drawing Board'' and the Captain's "Reading Stories" sessions, which introduced kids to stories such as ''[[Curious George]],'' ''[[Make Way for Ducklings]],'' and ''Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel.'' The [[Sweet Pickles]] books were featured.

Songs included ''Little Mary Make Believe'', ''Guess Who I Am'', ''Little Black Frog'', ''There's a Hole In the Bottom of the Sea'', ''Erie Canal'', ''Horse in Striped Pajamas'', ''The Littlest Snowman,'' ''Daniel the Cocker Spaniel,'' and many  more.  On the first show of every month the Captain would have a birthday cake for all of the children with birthdays that month.

Keeshan also had a recurring role as "The Town Clown", a pantomime piece that took place in and around the exposed wagon home of a tramp-like circus clown. Like the character of Clarabelle that he played on ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', the Town Clown never spoke.

Favorites on the show were [[Grandfather Clock (Captain Kangaroo)|Grandfather Clock]] (voiced by Gus Allegretti), Rollo the Hippo and Dancing Bear.

Dancing Bear was mute and only appeared in short subject features. He often danced waltzes to background music.

The show would very often have simple [[black light theatre]] segments utilizing paper or cardboard cutouts. A notable recording of a popular song, such as [[Judy Garland]] singing [[Over the Rainbow]] (from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''), [[Mary Martin]] singing [[Never Never Land (song)|Never Never Land]] (from ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]''), [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]] singing ''The Donkey Serenade'' (from ''[[The Firefly (film)|The Firefly]]''), or [[Danny Kaye]] singing [[Inchworm (song)|Inchworm]] (from ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'') would be heard while the cutouts played on the screen, animated by a concealed [[puppeteer]]. On other occasions, full-fledged [[hand puppet]]s would "perform" to the song being played.

Familiar props included a mockup of a talking cathedral-style radio that Keeshan simply called "Radio". Keeshan would turn the large knobs on "Radio" to get a conversation going. Reminiscent of the old [[Atwater Kent]] cathedrals, "Radio" had a rather interesting conversation with a smaller [[transistor radio]] in one show. Also featured was a huge Colgate toothpaste box with a large windup or clockwork key on the side. Keeshan turned the key to play a jingle ("Colgate Fluoride M-F-P/Helps Prevent the Cavity/And it Tastes Great, Naturally!") for the show's sponsor, Colgate Toothpaste.

==Theme song==
The original theme song to ''Captain Kangaroo'' (titled "Puffin' Billy") was used from 1955<U+2013>1974. It was an instrumental, written by [[Edward White (composer)|Edward G. White]]. The track was from a British stock music production library known as the ''Chappell Recorded Music Library'' which was sold through a New York agency called Emil Ascher. The tune's original title referred to a British steam locomotive. This tune was used on other programs on both sides of the Atlantic.  For example, two years before ''Captain Kangaroo'', it served as the wrap-up music for an episode of the radio program ''[[Rocky Fortune]]'' called "Murder Among the Statues". In its native United Kingdom, it became famous as the theme to the weekly BBC radio program ''[[Children's Favourites]]'' from 1952 to 1966, and is still widely recognised by the post-war generation.  It was later used in the [[Enid Blyton]] parody ''[[Five Go Mad in Dorset]]'' and in a number of British TV adverts, including a [[Captain Sensible]] spot.  The "Puffin' Billy" theme played as the opening of each episode, with the music continuing until the Captain hung his large ring of keys on a nail (which seemed to act as a switch to turn off the music). If the Captain's keys ever slipped off the nail, the music would begin playing again.

In 1957, lyricist Mary Rogers penned lyrics to the tune, creating a newly titled ''Captain Kangaroo'' song.

In 1974, a new theme song was composed for ''Captain Kangaroo,'' written by composer Robert L. Brush. As the new theme used similar melodic elements from the original theme, Edward G. White's name was added to the song credits.

Much later, around the 1980s, ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'' mainstay [[Lynn Ahrens]] (who composed and performed a few CK songs herself) composed a new theme, entitled "Here Comes Captain Kangaroo".

The theme song for ''All New Captain Kangaroo'' used the opening notes and part of the melody of the familiar theme as its introduction.

==Schedule history==
While ''Captain Kangaroo'' was still in planning stages, [[CBS]] executives had the idea of hiring [[Uncle Al Show|Al Lewis]], a kids' show host in [[Cincinnati]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was running Lewis' show at that time), to host their show, but Lewis' managers refused to release him from his contract. Lewis' local kids show went off the air in Cincinnati a year after ''Captain Kangaroo'' left CBS.

For the first three months, ''Captain Kangaroo'' was only seen on weekday mornings. From then until 1968, the show was also seen on Saturday mornings, except in the 1964-1965 season, when it was replaced by a Keeshan vehicle called ''Mr. Mayor''. After 1968, the show was again seen only on weekdays. Except for pre-emption for news coverage, notably the three-day continuous coverage of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, and a few shows that were 45&nbsp;minutes, the show aired a full 60&nbsp;minutes on weekday mornings until 1981. It was broadcast in color from September 9, 1968 onward.

The audience of children could never compete in the ratings with such entertainment/news shows as ''The Today Show'', although it won [[Emmy Awards]] three times as Outstanding Children's entertainment series in 1978<U+2013>1979, 1982<U+2013>1983 and 1983<U+2013>1984. But in the fall season of 1981, to make more room for ''[[CBS Morning News]]'', the Captain was moved to an earlier time slot of 7 a.m. and cut to 30&nbsp;minutes, sporting a new title ''Wake Up with the Captain''. In the fall of 1982, it was moved to Saturday mornings at 7 a.m. Eastern Time and 6 a.m. in other time zones. Reruns were offered to CBS affiliates to run Sunday morning in place of the cartoon reruns offered before, but most declined. One-third of CBS affiliates no longer ran the show at all after 1982. It was finally canceled altogether at the end of 1984 due to lack of clearances from affiliates.

Just over a year later, ''Captain Kangaroo'' ran in reruns on PBS television stations from 1986<U+2013>1993, with funding from [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) [[Public television]] stations, School Zone Publishing Company and from the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]]. [[American Public Television]], then known as the "Interregional Program Service", distributed the show, along with Britder Associates ''(Bob Keeshan's production company)'', and the Riehl Company, owned by former [[WPBT-TV]] station manager Dale Riehl.

The show was on the air for 29 years, making it one of the longest-running network children's program series. ''[[Sesame Street]]'', insulated from the [[Nielsen ratings]] wars, holds the record at over 40 years, and still airs. Several of the original ''Sesame Street'' writers and producers were hired from the ''Captain Kangaroo'' staff to help produce and direct the new program when it went on the air in 1969.

The original director of the program was Peter Birch who helmed the program for its first 25&nbsp;years. Producer Jim Hirschfeld took over as director following Birch's heart attack in 1980 and continued directing as well as producing throughout the rest of the history of the show which finally went off the air in 1993.

The cast of ''Captain Kangaroo'' also hosted the [[CBS]] coverage of the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] for several years in the 1960s.

==Schwinn marketing==
From the late 1950s, the [[Schwinn]] Bicycle Company made use of children's television programming to expand its dominance of the child and youth bicycle markets.  The company was an early sponsor (from 1958) of ''Captain Kangaroo''.  The Captain himself was enlisted to sell Schwinn-brand bicycles to the show's audience, typically six years old and under.<ref name=petty6>Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles: Lessons from the Leading Post-World War II U.S. Bicycle Brand'', Babson College, MA (2007), p. 6 [http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2013%202007/170-179_petty.pdf Article]</ref>  At the end of each live Schwinn marketing promotion, Bob Keeshan would intone, "Prices slightly higher in the South and in the West".  The on-air marketing program was deemed successful by Schwinn, and the company increased its market share of child and youth bicycles throughout the 1960s.<ref>Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles'', pp. 5<U+2013>7</ref>

The marketing program continued through the 1971 season, when the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s Staff Report, ''Guidelines on Advertising to Children'', recommended against Schwinn's on-air marketing practices using the show's host.  In response, Schwinn and the show's writers altered the format in 1972.  The Captain no longer insisted that his viewers purchase a Schwinn, but instead made regular on-air consultations of a new character, ''Mr. Schwinn Dealer''.<ref name=petty6 />  A 1973 internal company news article concluded that the show's child audience had difficulty separating Schwinn's sales pitch from that of the show.<ref name=petty6 />

==Popular culture==
Canadian sketch-comedy show [[Second City Television|SCTV]] spoofed Captain Kangaroo in its "Captain Combat" sketch first aired on Oct. 21, 1976.  The title character was performed by Dave Thomas with Harold Ramis as "Mr. Green Fatigues" and John Candy puppeteering "Gunny Rabbit".

Rock musician [[Frank Zappa]] wrote a composition named "Mr. Green Genes" on his album ''[[Uncle Meat]]'' and a sequel, "Son of Mr. Green Genes" on his album ''[[Hot Rats]]''. This led to the urban legend that Zappa was the son of [[Hugh Brannum]], the actor who played the character [[Mr. Green Jeans]] on Captain Kangaroo, a myth Zappa  officially dispelled in his 1989 autobiography, ''[[The Real Frank Zappa Book]]'', and also by Keeshan in his 1996 autobiography, ''Good Morning, Captain''.

Many popular songs make reference to ''Captain Kangaroo'', including the [[Statler Brothers]]' 1965 hit song "[[Flowers on the Wall]]", the [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] song "The Brady Bunch", the Bloodhound Gang's "Your Only Friends Are Make Believe", and the [[VeggieTales]] song, "[[The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything]]".

A Sunday ''[[Shoe (comic strip)|Shoe]]'' strip has Skyler admiring somebody on TV: "He looks great for his age", "He's a great communicator", etc. The reader is led to believe, and his Uncle Cosmo believes, he was referring to President [[Ronald Reagan]], but in the last panel Skyler reveals he has been referring to Captain Kangaroo. The strip was actually published in Keeshan's autobiography, "Good Morning Captain", in 1996.

[[Shari Lewis|Shari Lewis']] syndicated TV program ''The Shari Show'' was set in the offices of a fictional television network, Bearly Broadcasting. One of the network's performers was "Captain Person", a kangaroo and host of a children's show. Captain Person was closely modeled after Bob Keeshan's on-screen persona.

Television appearances on network shows by Captain Kangaroo:

*''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' <U+2013> January 4, 1998
*''[[Murphy Brown]]'' <U+2013> ''Brown vs. The [[Board of Education]]'' <U+2013> September 19, 1994
*''[[Day by Day (TV series)|Day by Day]]'' <U+2013> ''Trading Places'' <U+2013> November 27, 1988
*''[[Cher]]'' <U+2013> September 28, 1975
*''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' <U+2013> March 30, 1971
*''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'' <U+2013> December 19, 1970
*''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' <U+2013> April 27, 1970

The movie ''[[Black Dynamite]]'' features a minor character known as the "Captain Kangaroo Pimp", portrayed by a crew member who resembled Keeshan. In the movie, the [[pimp]] wears a red blazer very similar to the one worn by Keeshan.

The 1988 [[Pixar]] short ''[[Tin Toy]]'' features the theme song used in the introduction - but the volume is turned down when it goes to the setting, where it is heard on a television.

In 1992, the theme song was used in a British ad for [[Kraft Singles]].

In 2011, a commercial for [[Travelers Insurance]] features Puffin' Billy as the theme song.

==Revival==
In 2011, the trademark for "Captain Kangaroo" was acquired by The Cashin Comedy Co. According to the company's official website, the character would be "undergoing an update to appeal to contemporary  family audiences but will maintain a very firm foundation in Bob Keeshan<U+2019>s gentle approach to laughter and learning." The Captain will be portrayed by Pat Cashin. <ref>http://captain-kangaroo.com/ Captain Kangaroo/The Cashin Comedy Co. (Accessed 21 May 2011)</ref>
