'''AIDS-related lymphoma''' describes [[lymphoma]]s occurring in [[patient]]s with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]).

A lymphoma is a type of cancer arising from [[lymphatic system|lymphoid]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. In AIDS, the incidences of [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], primary [[telencephalon|cerebral]] lymphoma and [[Hodgkin's disease]] are all increased.

==Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma==
[[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] (NHL) is present in about 3% of [[HIV]] positive people at the time of their diagnosis of HIV. 20% of HIV positive patients will develop NHL.

==Primary cerebral lymphoma==
Primary cerebral lymphoma (or ''[[primary central nervous system lymphoma]]'') is a form of NHL. It is very rare in [[immunocompetent]] people, with an incidence of 5-30 cases per million person-years. However the incidence in [[immunocompromise]]d individuals is greatly increased, up to 100 per million person-years.

Primary cerebral lymphoma is strongly associated with [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). The presence of EBV [[DNA]] in [[cerebrospinal fluid]] is highly suggestive of primary cerebral lymphoma.

Treatment of AIDS patients with [[antiretroviral drug]]s reduces the incidence of primary cerebral lymphoma.

==Hodgkin's disease==
The incidence of [[Hodgkin's disease]] in the general population is about 10-30 per million person-years. This increases to 170 per million person-years in HIV positive patients.
