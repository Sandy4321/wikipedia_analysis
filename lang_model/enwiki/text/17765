The '''Altay Mountains''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0410><U+043B><U+0442><U+0430><U+0439>}}; {{lang-mn|<U+0410><U+043B><U+0442><U+0430><U+0439>}}, '''Altai''') are a [[mountain range]] in central [[Asia]], where [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] come together, and where the great [[river]]s [[Irtysh]], [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Yenisei]] have their sources. Altay Mountains are known as the [[Turkic peoples]]' birthplace. The northwest end of the range is at 52<U+00B0> N and between 84<U+00B0> and 90<U+00B0> E (where it merges with the [[Sayan Mountains]] to the east), and extends southeast from there to about {{coor d|45|N|99|E}}, where it gradually becomes lower and merges into the high plateau of the [[Gobi Desert]].

The name, in [[Turkic language|Turkic]] Alytau or Altay, means '''Al''' (gold), '''tau''' (mount); in [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] {{lang|mn|<U+0410><U+043B><U+0442><U+0430><U+0439><U+043D> <U+043D><U+0443><U+0440><U+0443><U+0443>}} ''Altain nuruu'', the "Mountains of Gold". The proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]] takes its name from the mountain range.

==Geography==
[[Image:Altai,Tienschan-Orte.png|thumb|left|300px|Map of the Altay mountain range]]
In the north of the region is the [[Sailughem Mountains]], also known as ''Kolyvan Altai''{{dubious}}, which stretch northeast from 49<U+00B0> N and 86<U+00B0> E towards the western extremity of the [[Sayan Mountains]] in 51<U+00B0> 60' N and 89<U+00B0> E. Their mean elevation is 1,500 to 1,750 m. The [[snow-line]] runs at 2,000 m on the northern side and at 2,400 m on the southern, and above it the rugged peaks tower up some 1,000 m more. [[Mountain pass]]es across the range are few and difficult, the chief being the [[Ulan-daban]] at 2,827 m (2,879 m according to Kozlov), and the [[Chapchan-daban]], at 3,217 m, in the south and north respectively. On the [[east]] and [[Ordinal directions|southeast]] this range is flanked by the great [[plateau]] of Mongolia, the transition being effected gradually by means of several minor plateaus, such as [[Ukok plateau|Ukok]] 2380 m with [[Pazyryk]] valley, [[Chuya]] 1,830 m, [[Kendykty]] 2,500 m, [[Kak]] 2,520 m, [[Suok]] 2,590 m, and [[Juvlu-kul]] 2,410 m.

This region is studded with large [[lake]]s, e.g. [[Uvs Nuur]] 720 m above [[sea level]], [[Kirghiz-nor]], [[Durga-nor]] and [[Khovd Nuur]] 1,170 m, and traversed by various [[mountain range]]s, of which the principal are the [[Tannu-Ola Mountains]], running roughly parallel with the [[Sayan Mountains]] as far east as the [[Kosso-gol]], and the [[Khan-khu Mountains]], also stretching west and east.

The north-western and northern slopes of the [[Sailughem Mountains]] are extremely steep and difficult to access. On this side lies the highest summit of the range, the double-headed [[Belukha]], whose summits reach 4,506 and 4,440 m respectively, and give origin to several [[glacier]]s (30 square kilometeres in aggregate area, [[as of 1911]]). Here also are the [[Kuitun]] (3,660 m) and several other lofty peaks. Numerous spurs, striking in all directions from the Sailughem mountains, fill up the space between that range and the lowlands of [[Tomsk]]. Such are the [[Chuya Alps]], having an average altitude of 2,700 m, with summits from 3,500 to 3,700 m, and at least ten glaciers on their northern slope; the [[Katun Alps]], which have a mean elevation of about 3,000 m and are mostly snow-clad; the [[Kholzun]] range; the [[Korgon]] 1,900 to 2,300 m, [[Talitskand Selitsk]] ranges; the [[Tigeretsk Alps]], .

Several secondary plateaus of lower altitude are also distinguished by geographers, The [[Katun valley]] begins as a wild gorge on the south-west slope of [[Belukha]]; then, after a big bend, the river (600 km long) pierces the [[Katun Alps]], and enters a wider valley, lying at an altitude of from 600 to 1,100 m, which it follows until it emerges from the Altai highlands to join the [[Biya River|Biya]] in a most picturesque region. The [[Katun River|Katun]] and the Biya together form the [[Ob River|Ob]].

The next valley is that of the [[Charysh]], which has the [[Korgon Alps|Korgon]] and [[Tigeretsk Alps]] on one side and the [[Talitsk Alps|Talitsk]] and [[Bashalatsk Alps]] on the other. This, too, is very fertile. The Altai, seen from this valley, presents the most romantic scenes, including the small but deep [[Kolyvan lake]] (altitude 360 m), which is surrounded by fantastic [[granite dome]]s and towers.

Farther west the valleys of the [[Uba]], the [[Ulba]] and the [[Bukhtarma]] open south-westwards towards the Irtysh. The lower part of the first, like the lower valley of the Charysh, is thickly populated; in the valley of the [[Ulba]] is the [[Riddersk]] mine, at the foot of the [[Ivanovsk Peak]] (2,060 m), clothed with alpine meadows. The valley of the [[Bukhtarma]], which has a length of 320 km, also has its origin at the foot of the [[Belukha]] and the [[Kuitun]] peaks, and as it falls some 1,500 m in about 300 km, from an alpine plateau at an elevation of 1,900 m to the [[Bukhtarma]] fortress (345 m), it offers the most striking contrasts of landscape and vegetation. Its upper parts abound in glaciers, the best known of which is the [[Berel]], which comes down from the [[Byelukha]]. On the northern side of the range which separates the upper [[Bukhtarma]] from the upper [[Katun]] is the [[Katun]] glacier, which after two ice-falls widens out to 700 to 900 metres. From a grotto in this glacier bursts tumultuously the [[Katun]] river.

The middle and lower parts of the Bukhtarma valley have been colonized since the 18th century by runaway Russian peasants, serfs and religious [[schism (religion)|schism]]atics ([[Raskolnik]]s), who created a free republic there on [[China|Chinese territory]]; and after this part of the valley was annexed to [[Russia]] in [[1869]], it was rapidly colonized. The high valleys farther north, on the same western face of the Sailughem range, are but little known, their only visitors being Kyrgyz shepherds.

Those of [[Bashkaus River|Bashkaus]], [[Chulyshman]], and [[Chulcha]], all three leading to the alpine lake of [[Lake Teletskoye|Teletskoye]] (length, 80 km; maximum width, 5 km; altitude, 520 m; area, 230.8 square kilometeres; maximum depth, 310 m; mean depth, 200 m), are inhabited by [[Telengit]] people. The shores of the lake rise almost sheer to over 1,800 m. From this lake issues the Biya, which joins the Katun at [[Biysk]], and then meanders through the prairies of the north-west of the Altai.

Farther north the Altai highlands are continued in the Kuznetsk district, which has a slightly different geological aspect, but still belongs to the Altai system. But the [[Abakan River|Abakan river]], which rises on the western shoulder of the Sayan mountains, belongs to the system of the [[Yenisei]]. The [[Kuznetsk Ala-tau]] range, on the left bank of the Abakan, runs north-east into the government of [[Yeniseisk]], while a complexus of mountains (Chukchut, Salair, Abakan) fills up the country northwards towards the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and westwards towards the [[Ob]].

The Ek-tagh or Mongolian Altai, which separates the [[Khovd Gol|Khovd]] basin on the north from the Irtysh basin on the south, is a true border-range, in that it rises in a steep and lofty [[escarpment]] from the [[Dzungaria]]n depression (470-900 m), but descends on the north by a relatively short slope to the plateau (1,150 to 1,680 m) of north-western [[Mongolia]]. East of 94<U+00B0> E the range is continued by a double series of mountain chains, all of which exhibit less sharply marked [[orography|orographical]] features and are at considerably lower elevations. The slopes of the constituent chains of the system are inhabited principally by nomadic [[Kyrgyz]].

==World Heritage site==
A vast area of 16,178 km<U+00B2> - Altai and Katun Natural Reserves, [[Lake Teletskoye]], Mount [[Belukha]] and the [[Ukok Plateau]] - comprise a natural [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] entitled [[Golden Mountains of Altai]]. As stated in the UNESCO description of the site, "the region represents the most complete sequence of altitudinal vegetation zones in central Siberia, from steppe, forest-steppe, mixed forest, subalpine vegetation to alpine vegetation". While making its decision, UNESCO also cited Russian Altai's importance for preservation of the globally endangered mammals, such as [[snow leopard]] and the [[Altai argali]].<ref>{{cite web

==Geology==
[[Image:Altai Kutscherla-See.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Altai, [[Lake Kutsherla]] in Altay Mountains]]
The Siberian Altai represents the northern most region affected by the tectonic collision of India into Asia. Massive fault systems run through the area, including the [[Kurai fault zone]] and the recently identified [[Tashanta fault zone]]. These fault systems are typically thrusts or right lateral [[strike-slip fault]]s, some of which are tectonically active. Rock types in the mountains are typically granites and metamorphic schists, and some are highly sheared near to fault zones. 

===Seismic activity===
On 27th September 2003 a massive [[earthquake]], measuring MW 7.3, occurred in the [[Chuya Basin]] area to the south of the Altai region. Seismic activity is however a rare occurrence. This earthquake and its [[aftershock]]s devastated much of the region, causing $10.6 million in damage (USGS) and wiping out the village of Beltir.
