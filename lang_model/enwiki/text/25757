"'''Oregon'''" is the fifth [[List of Awake episodes|episode]] of the [[Television in the United States|American]] [[police procedural]] [[drama]] [[television series]] ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', an episode that was scheduled to be the fourth broadcast episode before [[NBC]] changed the order. The episode first premiered on March 29, 2012 in the United States on NBC, was simultaneously broadcast on [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Television in Canada|Canada]], and was subsequently aired on [[Sky Atlantic]] in the [[Television in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] on June 1, 2012. It was written by consulting producer [[Lisa Zwerling]], and was directed by [[Aaron Lipstadt]]. This is one of the few episodes that was not written by series creator and [[executive producer]] [[Kyle Killen]]. "Oregon" was well received by television critics, who praised its storylines. Commentators noted that the script was well-written and that the episode was the "strongest outing" since "[[Pilot (Awake)|Pilot]]" broadcast on March 1, 2012. Upon airing, the episode garnered 3.18 million viewers in the United States and a 1.0/3 rating-share in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. It ranked second in its timeslot of the night, behind ''[[The Mentalist]]'' on [[CBS]].

The show centers on [[Michael Britten]] ([[Jason Isaacs]]), a [[police detective]] living in two separate realities after a [[car accident]]. In this episode, Michael deals with a case involving serial killer Gemini, who had killed another person in the "green reality". FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro ([[Megan Dodds]]) insisted that he is dead, as she killed him herself after he had committed a huge crime. Gemini had pretended to be a [[police officer]], and had framed Michael, and pretend that he was with him. Agent Santoro thinks that he is involved in the case due to this frame, and other reasons. Gemini enjects Santoro, and then takes her to a place outside. He starts to cut Santoro's wrist off, and Michael and his partner in the "green reality", Isaiah "Bird" Freeman ([[Steve Harris]]) go and get her. Meanwhile in the "red reality", Dr. Jonathan Lee ([[BD Wong]]) states that Michael and his wife [[Hannah Britten|Hannah]]'s ([[Laura Allen]]) marriage is falling apart. However, Hannah admits that she was "embarrassed".

== Plot ==
The episode opens in the "red reality" (where Hannah is alive and Rex isn't from the car accident), [[Michael Britten]] ([[Jason Isaacs]]) is jogging around [[Los Angeles]]. When Michael gets home, he talks to his wife [[Hannah Britten|Hannah]] ([[Laura Allen]]), who is in [[Oregon]] looking at a university. Later in the "green reality" (where Rex is alive and Hannah isn't from the car accident), Michael and [[Rex Britten|Rex]] ([[Dylan Minnette]]) are stuck in traffic, and Michael is later called into work. His partner in the "green reality", Isaiah "Bird" Freeman ([[Steve Harris (actor)|Steve Harris]]) talks to Michael, then Michael goes for a run at the [[Griffith Park]]. He goes to the top of a hill overlooking the city, while a dog appears from behind a bush and barks at him. Michael notices [[Hematophagy|human flesh]] in him, and goes to investigate, he finds a corpse sitting against a tree. Michael goes to the [[police station]], and shows Captain Harper similar cases starting in 1999. In each case, a killer, nicknamed Gemini (Salvator Xuereb), vertically slashed the victim's wrists and carved a [[Roman numeral]] in their chests. The murders have taken place all across the United States, but everyone believes that Gemini is dead after an FBI agent Elizabeth Santoro ([[Megan Dodds]]) had shot him. Michael wants to cover the area as much as they can and Captain Tricia Harper ([[Laura Innes]]) agrees and then tells Michael to pick up the profiler that the FBI has sent. Michael goes to [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] and meets with FBI agent, Elizabeth Santoro. They discuss his history and she admits that she's been focused solely on the "Gemini Killer" for the last 12 years. Michael confirms that they didn't find one on the body, so she figures that it's a copycat. Michael goes to the crime scene, while Bird is already there. The partners go over the hillside and find the dog. They take him to Dr. Banks ([[Chris McGarry]]) and have him check his stomach, and he finds a 2 dollar bill in its stomach. When Michael takes the evidence to Harper and Santoro, Santoro insists that it only means that someone with classified information to the case is involved. She suggests they check anyone who was recently laid off law enforcement officers with psych problem. Bird and Santoro create a database if the killer is alive. Santoro lets Harper decide and she tells the detectives to pull the files on law officers. As Santoro leaves, Michael approaches her and says that he understands the implications if the man she shot was Gemini. Meanwhile, the killer prepares a set of medical tools, a wad of 2 dollar bills, and a syring.

Later in the "green reality", Michael suggests they check cheap motels in the area, since Gemini set up base a couple miles from the sites of his murders. Later, Michael talks to the manager at one hotel. After he leaves the hotel, Michael sees a secret place closed and Michael breaks in, drawing his gun. He spots the "Gemini Killer", inside but he ran away when Michael identified himself as a police officer, Michael ran after him. Soon after, the CSI team investigates, and Harper and Santoro wonder why Michael was there and he says that he was checking out motels and thought the building looked suspicious, and Santoro claimed that Michael is a "suspect". They're unaware that the killer is listening to them from a nearby vent. Michael leaves the investigation, and as he goes to his car, and the killer is seen dressed in a police uniform, as he is starting at him. Later at the station, Harper tells him that they got a call from someone claiming to be their guy. She plays a recording and Gemini addresses Michael as his friend, and Santoro, and was trying to framing Michael. Harper tells Michael that they traced the call to his home phone. Later, Michael meets with Bird and find out that the killer was going to eject and then murder Agent Santoro. Later, the Gemini killer begins to start cutting the FBI agent's wrist. Minutes later, Michael and Bird try to find the killer, and the agent. They find her and see is taken to the hospital. Her family comes and sees her. Later, Michael tells Hannah what he's learned about the movers and Oregon. She shares her secrets, claimed that she was "embarrassed", and they talk.

Michael's shrink in the "green reality", Dr. Judith Evans ([[Cherry Jones]]) cites that one reality will begin the seem as a fantasy. As Michael leaves, in the car, Gemini calls Michael and explains that he was intrigued by Michael's success in tracking him down. He broke into Evans<U+2019> office and read her files, and asks Michael if he can't tell if he's awake or asleep. However, Gemini says that the world needs people like him and Michael, people who can see it sideways. As he takes a flight to Portland, Gemini says that he hopes Michael doesn't wake up and then hangs up.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matthew |last=Delman |url=http://sciencefiction.com/2012/03/30/awake-oregon-recap/ |title='Awake: Oregon' - Recap |publisher=Science Fiction |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>
