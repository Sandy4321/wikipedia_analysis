==Biography==

Panarin graduated from the Higher Military Command School of Telecommunications of the [[KGB]] (now the Academy of Federal Security Guard Service of the [[Russian Federation]]) in [[Oryol]], and the Division of Psychology of the Military-Political Academy (with a gold medal). In 1993 he defended his thesis for Candidate of Psychological Sciences, entitled "Psychological Factors of the Officer's Activity in Conditions of Innovations". His Doctorate in Political Sciences was awarded by the Russian Academy of Public Administration in 1997 for a thesis entitled "Informational-Psychological Ensuring of the National Security of Russia".<ref name=kommersant/>

Panarin began his career in the KGB in 1976. In the 1990s, he worked in the [[FAPSI]], then the Russian equivalent of the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]. His field of activity was strategic analysis and integration of closed and open information streams, information stream management in crisis situations, and situation modelling of global processes. He did strategy forecasts for the then President [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref name=WSJ/> From 2001 to 2004, he worked as the Head of the Analytical Division of the Central Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation.<ref name=kommersant/> From 2006<ref name=spaceagency>[http://www.kommersant.com/p669371/r_1/Space_Agency_Declares_Informational_War/ Space agency declares informational war], ''[[Kommersant]]'', 25 Aprill 2006</ref> to 2007,<ref name=spaceresign>[http://rian.ru/politics/20070730/69932977.html Roskosmos press-secretary resigned], ''[[RIA Novosti]]'', 30 July 2007 {{ru icon}}</ref> Panarin was the [[Press Secretary]] of the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]].

In April 2008, Panarin carried out his first training seminar on [[information warfare]] entitled "Information warfare - technologies for success", targeted at top managers of state and business structures, press service managers of authorities and large corporations, anti-crisis management experts as well as decision makers in time-deficit situations.<ref name=seminars>[http://panarin-seminars.ru Igor Paranin's seminars on information warfare] {{ru icon}}</ref>

==Initiatives==

In January 2006 Panarin proposed the creation of an [[Eurasia]]n Rus as an interstate formation modelled after the [[European Union]] on the territory of the post-Soviet area headed by a Prince (after [[Macchiavelli]]) which would restore and strengthen the economic integration, with gradual incorporation of a series of Balkan and other countries.<ref name=eurasian>Igor Panarin, "[http://www.km.ru/strategy/index.asp?data=12.01.2006%2019:46:00 From United Russia to Eurasian Rus]", ''Cyril and Methodius'', 12 January 2006 {{ru icon}}</ref> He proposed [[Putin]] as the first Prince of the Eurasian Rus. Later (in 2009) he renamed the formation to Eurasian Union and proposed St. Petersburg as its capitol by 2012, when in his view only 3 planetary centres of force would exist - the European Union (EU-1), the Eurasian Union (EU-2), and the Chinese Commonwealth.<ref name=skynews/><ref name=propolonia/><ref name=izvestia>[http://www.izvestia.ru/economic/article3126921/ The Prince of the post-Soviet space will be Vladimir Putin], an interview for ''[[Izvestia]]'', 1 April 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref>

In February 2006 Panarin was the first to propose the creation of a [[ruble]]-denominated oil-trading exchange in Russia. Such an exchange was opened in [[St Petersburg]] on 24 September 2008, and as soon as in March 2009, [[Rosneft]] (the leader in the Russian oil field and one of the largest public oil companies in the world) sold by auction 7.6 thousands of tonnes of oil products for 97 millions of rubles. For March, the auction volume amounts to 15-20 thousands of tonnes of oil products monthly, but by May could double. Besides Rosneft, other major Russian oil companies like [[Gazprom]] Oil, [[Lukoil]], [[Surgutneftegas]] and [[TNK-BP]] also plan to go to the exchange, and crude oil trade is expected to start in a few months.<ref name=oilexchange>[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=1144769 St. Petersburg's exchange filled up], ''Kommersant'', 27 March 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref>

In January 2009 Panarin proposed the creation of a Quintilateral Commission (five sides from the five continents) as an expert mechanism for international consultation on seeking ways out of the world crisis.<ref name=quintilateral>Igor Panarin, "[http://www.panarin.com/comment/1116 Proposal for creation of a Quintilateral commission]", 27 January 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref> He reasserted this idea in March, explaining that the commission's task would be to create powerful instruments of national and international forecasting.<ref name=RussiaToday/>

In March 2009 he also proposed the creation of a new world currency ACURE based on the three leading world currencies: the [[Asian Currency Unit]] (a regional currency basket that was first proposed in 2006 based on the currencies of Japan, China and South Korea along with the [[ASEAN]] group), the Ruble and the Euro.<ref name=propolonia/><ref name=izvestia/><ref name=acure>Igor Panarin, "[http://www.panarin.com/comment/1165 Proposal for creation of a world currency ACURE]", 28 March 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref> In his view, the coordinated introduction of the ACURE in 20 countries would allow a painless transition to a new model of world development.

==Prediction of the USA's collapse in 2010==

In the summer of 1998,<ref name=peoplestar>[http://www.peoplestar.co.uk/index.html?watch=39 CNN talks to Prof. Igor Panarin who theorizes that by 2010 the United States will fracture], ''peoplestar.co.uk'', 1 January 2009 [video]</ref> based on [[classified information|classified]] data about the state of the U.S. economy and society<ref name=eurasia>[http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/cogit_content/articoli/EkFlZyylZypqtmvasE.shtml Panarin and the disintegration of the USA], ''Eurasia'', 3 April 2009 {{it icon}}</ref> supplied to him by fellow [[FAPSI]] analysts,<ref name=WSJ/> Panarin forecast the disintegration of the [[USA]] in 2010 (as he later specified, at the end of June - start of July 2010<ref name=finam>[http://www.panarin.com/comment/1068 A monetary reform is possible in the USA], a radio interview for ''Finam.fm'', 10 December 2008 {{ru icon}}</ref>), following a [[civil war]] triggered by mass [[immigration]], [[economy|economic]] decline, and [[moral]] degradation. He forecast financial and demographic changes provoking a political crisis in which wealthier states will withhold funds from the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], effectively [[secession|seceding]] from the Union, leading to social unrest, civil war, national division and the intervention of foreign powers.<ref name=WSJ/> Panarin sees the task of the world elite as not letting the USA follow the [[Yugoslavia]]n model of disintegration. It is desirable that it follows the [[Czechoslovakia]]n model of disintegration so that everything goes calmly and peacefully.<ref name=quintilateral/>

This idea was first presented at 12:30 local time (11:30 [[UTC]]) on Wednesday, 9 September 1998, in the [[Adalbert Stifter]] Hall (Stiftersaal) of the [[:de:Brucknerhaus|Brucknerhaus]], [[Linz]], [[Austria]], when Panarin spoke at the [[Ars Electronica]] Infowar'98<ref name=infowar98>[http://www.amazon.com/Ars-Electronica-98-Gerfried-Stocker/dp/3211831347 Ars Electronica 98: Infowar], 1 November 1998, ''[[Springer Verlag]], ISBN 978-3211831342''</ref> symposium devoted to [[information warfare]]. There were 400 participants in the symposium, 150 of which from the USA.<ref name=izvestiart>[http://www.russiatoday.com/Art_and_Fun/2008-11-26/Professor_Igor_Panarin_When_America_fell_to_pieces_the_shouting_was_outrageous_.html Professor Igor Panarin: When America fell to pieces the shouting was outrageous], an interview for ''[[Izvestia]]'', 26 November 2008</ref> In his presentation, Panarin viewed the [[Lewinsky affair]] and the shootings at American schools as the first signs of a mental collapse of the U.S. society. He said that the aggressive [[Foreign policy of the United States|policy of the United States]] has turned against themselves, predicted a collapse of the USA in 2010 and showed a map of the six parts into which the USA will disintegrate in his view (see below).<ref name=infowar98_9_9>[http://90.146.8.18/infowar/DOKU98/9/sy_mi-10-13.html Ars Electronica 98 InfoWar], ''[[Ars Electronica]]'', 10 December 1998 {{de icon}}</ref>

===Six divisions===

[[File:Panarin.svg|thumb|400px|A map showing Igor Panarin's prediction of the [[United States|USA]]'s disintegration ([http://90.146.8.18/infowar/DOKU98/9/panarin4.jpg original]). Compare with the [[:File:Census Regions and Divisions.PNG|map of the census regions]] of the USA.]]

Panarin's scenario sees the [[United States|U.S.]] ([[Territories of the United States|territories]] excluded) split into six parts, each to be in the [[sphere of influence]] of another country or join one:<ref name=WSJ/><ref name=wethepeople/><ref name=bloomberg/>

* '''The Californian [[Republic]]''' - predicted to become part of [[People's Republic of China|China]] or be under Chinese influence
*:'' Comprising [[California]], [[Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]] and [[Idaho]]
* '''The Texas Republic''' - predicted to become a part of [[Mexico]] or be under Mexican influence
*:'' Comprising [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Florida]]
* '''[[Atlantic]] America''' - may join the [[European Union]]
*:'' Comprising the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] (including all [[BosWash]] states and [[West Virginia]]) plus [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]]
* '''Central North American Republic''' - predicted to become a part of [[Canada]] or be under Canadian influence
*:'' Comprising the [[Midwest]] plus [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]]
* '''[[Alaska]]''' - predicted to return to [[Russia]]n rule
* '''[[Hawaii]]''' - would go to either [[China]] or [[Japan]]

===Lectures===

Panarin repeated his predictions in a lecture at the Diplomatic Academy in Moscow on 3 March 2009, saying "there is a high probability that the collapse of the United States will occur by 2010."  The Russian Foreign Ministry invited foreign reporters to attend the lecture, which drew an audience of students, professors and diplomats.<ref name=AP/>

On 10 March 2009, in a lecture in the University of the Philippines, Panarin stated that the history of the United States shows that it has no future and that the fall of [[Wall Street]] could be likened to the end of the [[American Dream]]. He said that through their legislatures, eight US states had reiterated their sovereignty vis-<U+00E0>-vis the US federal government,<ref name=freestateproject>[http://forum.freestateproject.org/index.php?topic=16827.0 Eleven states and one republic now declaring sovereignty], ''freestateproject.org'', 6 February 2009</ref> seven of them just this February,<ref name=landon>Lance Landon, "[http://www.opednews.com/articles/Firestorm-Brewing-Between-by-Lance-L-Landon-090217-130.html Firestorm brewing between U.S. states and federal government]", ''OpEdNews'', 19 February 2009</ref> and some native American groups had also declared their "independence" from the union<ref name=lakotah>[http://www.republicoflakotah.com/?page_id=75 Lakotah unilateral withdrawal from all agreements and treaties with the United States of America], ''[[Republic of Lakotah]]'', 17 December 2007</ref>. Panarin has also compared [[Barack Obama]] to the USSR's last leader, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].  Panarin said that Gorbachev also had beautiful words to say, but in practice he failed to manage the drastic changes, and presided over the Union's economic disaster and national collapse.<ref name=inquirer>[http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view/20090311-193488/Russian-sees-end-of-American-Dream Russian sees end of American Dream], ''[[Inquirer.net]]'', 11 March 2009</ref><ref name=Gorbachev>Igor Panarin, "[http://www.panarin.com/doc/87 Gorbachev - the Antihero of Russia]" {{ru icon}}</ref>

===Interviews===

Following the [[2008 financial crisis]], Panarin's theory gained international attention.

=====Stalinists and Trotskyites in the U.S. elite=====
The "buzz" started after his interview for ''[[Izvestia]]'' on 24 November 2009 (later translated into English, French, German and Spanish),<ref name=aifint>[http://www.aif.ru/article/print/article_id/24859 Prognoses of a modern Nostradamus - food riots await the USA], an interview for ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'', 24 February 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref> in which he claimed that the U.S. economy is already collapsing and the skeleton which holds the USA together is fragile. He expressed his view that the key division in the U.S. elite is not between Democrats and Republicans but between [[Stalinism|Stalinist]]-statesmen (key figures: [[Robert Gates]], [[Michael Hayden]] and [[John Michael McConnell]]) and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]]-globalists (key figures: [[Condoleezza Rice]] and [[Dick Cheney]]), which two "clans" exist in both main parties and are already in open confrontation.<ref  name=izvestiart/>

=====65% probability of U.S. breakup=====
In an interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' on 29 December 2008, he said he was being interviewed about his predictions as much as twice a day and expected the attention to grow even stronger.<ref name=WSJ/> In the interview, he estimated a 55-45% chance (increased by him to 65-35% in February 2009)<ref name=evilempire>[http://www.panarin.com/comment/1123 The U.S. - an evil empire?], a radio dispute between Igor Panarin and [[Nikolai Zlobin]] at the ''[[Echo of Moscow]]'', 8 February 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref> that the disintegration would occur,<ref name=WSJ/><ref name=wethepeople>[http://usa-wethepeople.com/igor-panarin-predicts-break-up-of-the-united-states/ Igor Panarin predicts break up of the United States], ''USA-wethepeople.com'', 31 December 2008</ref> saying that while he does not dislike Americans, the situation for them is dire.<ref name=WSJ>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123051100709638419.html As if things weren't bad enough, Russian professor predicts end of U.S.], an interview for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 29 December 2008</ref> 

=====Similar predictions by other experts=====
On 24 February 2009, Panarin was interviewed by ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' who invited him to comment the prediction of [[Gerald Celente]] for [[tax revolt]]s and food riots in the States by 2012. Panarin agreed with Celente (later he also mentioned a similar prognosis of financier [[Bob Moriarty]])<ref name=quintilateral/> and said that American philosopher and historian [[Stephen F. Cohen]] similarly predicted a collapse of the USA but around February 2013, and French political scientist [[Emmanuel Todd]] also predicted a U.S. collapse in principle without mentioning a date.<ref name=aifint></ref>

=====The U.S. of today is like the ''Titanic''=====
In his interview for the English language TV channel ''[[Russia Today]]'' on 25 March 2009, Panarin compared the U.S. of today to the ''[[Titanic]]'' steamship which has already collided with an iceberg, except that so far the crew of this ''Titanic'' is trying to save only itself and neither the ship nor the passengers. He also advised Barack Obama to radically reduce U.S. foreign policy activities, especially in the Eurasian region.<ref name=RussiaToday>[http://www.russiatoday.com/Politics/2009-03-25/Is_there_anything_Obama_can_do_about_the_US_collapse.html?fullstory Is there anything Obama can do about the US collapse?], an interview for ''[[Russia Today]]'', 25 March 2009</ref>

=====U.S. collapse to improve Russia's relations with Germany and Poland=====
On 31 March 2009, in his interview for ''[[Sky News]]'', he claimed again that the failure of the April [[2009 G-20 London summit]] to reverse the global recession will be followed by a complete collapse of the U.S. economy, a civil war, and the country's disintegration by the summer of 2010.<ref name=skynews/> The same day Panarin was interviewed by the Polish newspaper ''Pro Polonia''. He said that the U.S. collapse will contribute to better Russian-German and Russian-Polish relations, and encouraged Russians and Poles to remember that they are all [[Slavs]].<ref name=propolonia>[http://www.propolonia.pl/article.php?art=254 The USA will disintegrate next year], an interview for ''Pro Polonia'', 31 March 2009 {{pl icon}}</ref>

=====Obama's plan leads to a disaster for the U.S.=====
The next day Panarin was interviewed by ''[[Izvestia]]'' and said that whether one agrees or not with his concept of U.S. collapse, the majority of the world's politicians already acknowledge that, unconditionally, the States will lose the role of the world leader. The U.S.' influence in Eurasia will diminish and Russia must fill this vacuum before the other players do.<ref name=izvestia/> In his interview the same day for ''Russian Journal'', he claimed that the alleged "reset" in the Russian-American relation is a farce while the U.S. still keep their old foreign policy, failing to realise that they can no longer afford it after the collapse of [[Wall Street]], which means that the Obama's entourage can't objectively analyse the situation. Panarin agreed with [[Paul Krugman]] that the Obama's plan leads to a disaster, predicted an internal chaos in the USA by November 2009 and an inevitable U.S. withdrawal from Eurasia, and concluded that the time for unilateral concessions for Russia is over.<ref name=russjournal>Igor Panarin, "[http://www.panarin.com/comment/1172 There is no reset - and there won't be]", an interview for ''Russian Journal'', 1 April 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref>

=====Signs for preparations of the U.S. authorities for a new civil war=====
In his interview for Russia's top-selling newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' on 6 April 2009, Panarin said that even now 43 of the 50 U.S. states are subsidised, and Puerto Rico declared insolvency. For November 2009, he predicted a crash of the U.S. Dollar, sharp decline of the socio-economic state of the U.S., and flourishing regional leaders who will remember the independent [[Republic of Texas|Texas Republic]], [[Vermont Republic]] and similar formations. The future of the U.S. will depend on new [[Lenin]]s and [[Trotsky]]s, and also on the actions of the [[US armed forces]], which have already been prepared for this through the creation of [[Rapid Deployment Forces]] of 6000 soldiers (to be increased to 20000),<ref name=forces>[http://www.propagandamatrix.com/articles/january2009/010809_security_force.htm Marines admit "security force" to operate inside U.S.], ''Paul Joseph Watson'', 8 January 2009</ref> building [[FEMA]] / [[Rex 84]] camps<ref name=fol>[http://www.friendsofliberty.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1062 FEMA concentration camps: locations and executive orders], ''Friends of Liberty'', 4 September 2004</ref><ref name=camps>[http://www.infowars.com/new-legislation-authorizes-fema-camps-in-us/ New legislation authorizes FEMA camps], ''Paul Joseph Watson'', 27 January 2009</ref> for the unreliable individuals, and storing millions of plastic coffins in the Atlanta region.<ref name=coffins>[http://www.infowars.com/a-half-a-million-plastic-coffins/ Half a million plastic coffins?], ''[[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]]'', 18 July 2008</ref> The question whether the [[US army]] would and could suppress the looming "parade of sovereignties" is open, because the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] couldn't return [[New Orleans]] to normal life 3 years after the terrible [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|flood]] there. Asked about Russia, he said that it must claim the zones of its interest (the [[CIS]], Mongolia, Eastern Europe, Alaska) and work for their economic integration. But Russia must keep maximal neutrality while the U.S. head for collapse, without interference in their internal affairs, and ask in return the U.S. to stop attacks against Russia, such as the deployment of the [[Missile Defense Agency|missile defence]] [[US missile defense complex in Poland|in Eastern Europe]] or the interference in the CIS affairs.<ref name=kp>[http://www.kp.ru/daily/24272.5/468378/ The USA will collapse next year, like the USSR did], an interview for ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', 6 April 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref>

=====Obama - the American Gorbachev=====
The same day he was interviewed by ''Govorit Moskva'' radio station. He criticised Obama for acting just like Bush, noted that his November's prognosis about the end of [[Obamamania]] ("by spring it will become clear that a miracle will not happen")<ref name=izvestiart/> came true with the fall of Obama's rating with unprecedented rate (from 84% in January to 56% in March)<ref name=zogby>[http://zogby.com/news/ReadNews.cfm?ID=1681 Survey finds 56% view President Obama favourably while his positive job approval ratings hold steady at 52%], ''[[Zogby International]]'' 6 March 2009</ref> and predicted its fall to 10% in six months. He called the meeting<ref name=xinhua>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/24/content_11060726.htm Obama meets former Soviet leader Gorbachev last week], ''[[Xinhua]]'', 24 March 2009</ref> of [[Gorbachev]] and Obama "symbolic".<ref name=govoritmoskva>[http://www.panarin.com/comment/1181 What will the USA be in the future?], a radio interview for ''Govorit Moskva'', 6 April 2009 {{ru icon}}</ref>

===Plaudits===

Writing about Panarin and his predictions, the website of the Italian geopolitics magazine ''Eurasia'' points out<ref name=eurasia/> that secessionist movements in the USA raise voice - for example actor and political activist [[Chuck Norris]] wants to be president of "independent Texas",<ref name=chucknorris>[http://www.eurasia-rivista.org/cogit_content/articoli/EkFlZyylZypqtmvasE.shtml Chuck Norris organises the first meeting of the militia for secession of Texas], ''Eurasia-rivista.org'', 26 March 2009 {{it icon}}</ref> like the [[Texas Republic]] was for 10 years (also reported<ref name-examiner>[http://www.examiner.com/x-2071-DC-Special-Interests-Examiner~y2009m3d9-Chuck-Norris-claims-thousands-of-right-wing-cell-groups-exist-and-will-rebel-against-US-government Chuck Norris claims thousands of right wing cell groups exist and will rebel against U.S. government], ''Examiner.com'', 9 March 2009</ref> by ''Examiner'', Denver, Colorado).

''Eurasia'''s website also cites the report of the French [[think tank]] [[Leap2020|Leap/Europe 2020]] in which they disclose the likelihood of civil unrest or real civil war in the autumn in countries like the U.S., claiming that they will experience a true strategic dislocation challenging their territorial integrity and all of its zones of influence in the world.<ref name=europe2020>[http://www.europe2020.org/spip.php?article587 The 4th quarter of 2009 - start of the 5th stage of the global systematic crisis, the stage of global political dislocation], ''[[Leap2020|Europe2020]]'', 15 February 2009 {{fr icon}}</ref>

''Eurasia'' will publish an interview with Panarin in the next months, and it has organized a Panarin's conference in Milan (Italy) for May 2009.

===Criticism===

Some commentators have accused Panarin of claiming that after a collapse of the U.S., Russia would be left as the dominant [[superpower]].<ref name=guardian>E.g. James Marson, "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/20/creditcrunch-russia Russia must face reality]", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 January 2009</ref> 
However, Panarin made it clear that he did not wish for the breakup of the United States. Such an event may not be the best case scenario for Russia, since its economy would suffer because of its dependence on the [[United States dollar|dollar]] and its trade with the U.S.<ref name=wethepeople/> On the other hand, regaining of [[Russian Alaska|Alaska]] and expansion of the [[ruble]] on the American continent would expand Russia's strategic potential. It could lower its defence expenses because [[NATO]] would be dissolved in favour of European security forces and Russia has no problems with the [[EU]].<ref name=aktualne>[http://aktualne.centrum.cz/zahranici/evropa/clanek.phtml?id=632570 The fate of the USSR awaits the USA], and interview for ''Aktualne'', 20 March 2009 {{cs icon}}</ref>

Other [[Russia]]n [[commentator]]s including [[Vladimir Pozner (junior)|Vladimir Pozner]] have dismissed his predictions.<ref name=bloomberg>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103 Russian professor says U.S. will break up after economic crisis], ''[[Bloomberg.com]]'', 24 November 2008</ref>
Additionally, some scholars have asked if the scenario doesn't better describe Russia than the United States: Russia has very clear [[Ethnic groups in Russia|ethnic regions]], and a weaker and less-diversified economy. Panarin dismissed the idea, saying that Russia's collapse will not occur.<ref name=AP>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29504880/ Russian scholar says US will collapse - next year], ''[[Associated Press]]'', 4 March 2009.</ref>

The Russian-American political scientist [[Nikolai Zlobin]] said he doesn't believe the U.S. will collapse because he sees no motivations or driving forces for this.<ref name=evilempire/>

Sergey Rogov, director of the Russian [[Institute for US and Canadian Studies]], labelled Panarin's predictions as "chase for sensation", "ideological charge of propaganda and self-advertisement", and "astrology".<ref name=kp/>

Panarin defends his analysis by reference to other people who made early forecasts of national disintegrations, such as [[Emmanuel Todd]] who [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|predicted the fall of the USSR]] in 1976.<ref name=WSJ/>

===Clairvoyance===

According to the Russian weekly [[Argumenty i Fakty]], the blind Bulgarian prophetess [[Baba Vanga|Vanga]] (1911-1996) who is said to have predicted many historic events had predicted that "a black man will become the 44th U.S. President, and this President will be the last one because America will freeze up or go down in the economics; it probably can divide into the North and South states".<ref name=aif>[http://www.aif.ru/article/print/article_id/22486 "Black President election will destroy USA", Vanga said], ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'', 6 November 2008</ref> Panarin was not aware of her prediction when he deduced his conclusions in 1998.
