"'''Benzin'''" (German, in {{lang-en|Gasoline}}) is a song by German [[industrial metal]] band [[Rammstein]], released as the first single from their album ''[[Rosenrot]]''.

In [[Germany]], [[gasoline]] is called ''Benzin'' (which is derived from the chemical mixture [[benzine]]). The song uses the word "Gasolin", however the word does not exist in the [[German language]], but it is an [[English language|English]] word made German.  There was, however, a German chain of gas stations called "Gasolin." 

Benzin was Rammstein's first number one single, getting to number one in Finland after its release in 2005.

==Music video==

In the video, [[Rammstein]] are firefighters.  They have not had a call for a long time, and are thus very ill-equipped for dealing with an emergency.  They enter a huge, eight-lane-wide fire-engine, and set off on their journey, not taking any notice of the damage they are causing, or the people they are killing.  They plow through high-voltage power-lines, trains, trees and normal road vehicles; despite this, the truck remains unscratched.
During the journey, the scene changes to a fantasy by guitarist [[Paul Landers|Paul H. Landers]], during which he saves a "damsel-in-distress" from a burning building.  During this fantasy, the band members are playing Benzin in the background amongst the smoke.
The scene returns to the Fire-engine, plowing through traffic and buildings before it overturns and sends the band-members crashing through the windscreen.  As Till comes round, a man points to the top of a nearby building.  It dawns on them that they have crashed right outside the emergency.
They scramble to get a safety trampoline out for the jumper, who happens to be [[Christian Lorenz|Christian "Flake" Lorenz]]. The trampoline rips just as he jumps, and thus, despite all that carnage and destruction, his bandmates completely fail to save his life.

==Live performances==

The song was first played live in the [[Reise, Reise]] tour on June 23, 2005 in Berlin's Wuhlheide [http://rammsteinniccage.com/concerts/shows/062305.html], months before its release. It replaced Moskau on the setlist. Benzin was played on the next two nights, lyrics changing a little bit even from one night to the next.  Theatrical flames shot twenty meters into the air during those live performances. It was then played in the non-festival concerts until the end of the tour, but this time without any pyrotechnics. However, as of the Liebe Ist F<U+00FC>r Alle Da tour, Benzin has returned to being performed with pyrotechnics, including a flamethrower disguised as a petrol pump. By the end of the song Till Lindemann uses it to set a 'fan' on fire, who runs through the stage until the song is over.
