'''Peter Doherty''' (born 12 March 1979) is an [[English people|English]] [[musician]], [[writer]], and [[artist]]. He is best known musically, for being co-frontman of [[The Libertines]], which he reformed with [[Carl Bar<U+00E2>t]] in 2010. His other musical project is [[indie band]] [[Babyshambles]]. In 2005, Doherty became prominent in tabloids, the news media, and pop culture blogs because of his romantic relationship with [[model (person)|model]] [[Kate Moss]] and his frequently-publicised heroin addiction. 

==Early life==
Peter Doherty was born in [[Hexham]], [[Northumberland]], England, the son of Jacqueline (n<U+00E9>e Michels), who is of paternal [[Jew]]ish and maternal [[Russians|Russian]] descent{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and Peter John Doherty, who is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news

==Career==
===The Libertines===

{{Main|The Libertines}}
Doherty and Bar<U+00E2>t formed a band called The Libertines in the late '90s, although it was not until 2002, with the release of their debut album ''[[Up the Bracket]]'', that they began to achieve widespread mainstream success.

The group achieved critical and commercial success and gained a dedicated cult following, with Doherty in particular being praised by fans and critics alike as one of the most promising songwriters to emerge on the British music scene for some time. However, Doherty's increasing drug problems led to his estrangement from the band. In 2003, he was jailed for burgling Bar<U+00E2>t's flat.<ref name="BurglingCarl">{{cite news

The two initially fell out over this incident, but made amends whilst Doherty was in prison. He was originally sentenced to 6 months, but his sentence was cut to 2 months. Upon his release, Doherty immediately reunited with Bar<U+00E2>t and the rest of the band to play a gig in the Tap 'n' Tin pub in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Kent]].<ref name="RejoinLibsKent">{{cite news

}}</ref>

Following his rejoining of the band, Doherty sought treatment for his drug addiction. He attended the alternative detox centre [[Wat Tham Krabok]], a temple in Thailand, famous for its rehabilitation program for [[Crack cocaine|crack]] and [[heroin]] users, where he was beaten with a bamboo cane and forced to drink foul herbal concoctions to induce vomiting. He left after three days and returned to England.<ref name="Rehab Fiasco">{{cite news

However, while post-production work was taking place on the second Libertines album (also called ''[[The Libertines (album)|The Libertines]]'') in June 2004, Doherty was again asked to leave the band. The band cited Doherty's continuing drug addiction as the reason for his dismissal, but emphasised their willingness to take him back once he had addressed his addiction. Although Bar<U+00E2>t had previously stated that the Libertines were merely on hiatus, pending Doherty's recovery, the group effectively disbanded with Doherty's departure at the end of 2004.<ref name="BoundTogether"/> The remaining members became involved in other projects (see [[Yeti (band)|Yeti]] and [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]]).

On 12 April 2007, Pete Doherty and Carl Bar<U+00E2>t played 13 songs together at the second of Doherty's "An Evening with Pete Doherty" gigs at the [[Hackney Empire]], London.<ref>{{cite web

Doherty and Barat announced on 29 March 2010 that The Libertines will reunite to play the Reading and Leeds festival in August.  They have also announced that they will be playing a gig beforehand at "the forum".{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Collaborations===
Prior to the disbanding of The Libertines, Doherty collaborated with local poet [[Peter Wolfe (musician)|Wolfman]]. Together they recorded the single "[[For Lovers]]", which entered the top 10, charting at number 7, in April of the same year.

A number of artists and bands, such as [[Dirty Pretty Things (band)|Dirty Pretty Things]], [[We Are Scientists]], [[The Kooks]] and [[The Holloways]], also featured on the track.

{{Main|Babyshambles}}
Doherty founded Babyshambles towards the end of his time with The Libertines. The group has released two studio albums, ''[[Down in Albion]]'', in November 2005 and ''[[Shotter's Nation]]'' in October 2007. The band's touring schedule and releases have occasionally been disrupted by Doherty's ongoing legal problems. 

The line-up of the band has changed several times: drummer [[Gemma Clarke]] left the band due to Doherty's drug problems and was replaced by [[Adam Ficek]], and guitarist and co-songwriter [[Patrick Walden]] has also left the band and was replaced by [[Mick Whitnall]].

In August 2006, Babyshambles signed up with major record label [[Parlophone]], on which they released ''[[The Blinding EP]]'' on 9 December 2006 to  critical acclaim.<ref name="Parlophone">{{cite news

[[File:RoyalAlbertHall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Albert Hall]], where Doherty played his biggest solo show as of 2008.]]
On 12 July 2008, Doherty played a solo gig at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. It was his biggest solo show so far. The concert was originally scheduled for 26 April, but had to be rescheduled to a later date due to Doherty being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison for breaching probation on 8 April.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/live/story/0,,2290716,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Pete Doherty | first=Betty | last=Clarke | date=2008-07-14 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> The solo show did not get the best ratings but was all in all still well received. According to the critics "whole chunks of the set passed by as listless noodling, with neither Doherty nor the audience appearing to know quite how to behave". The consensus was that - without a full band - Doherty seemed out of place at such a big venue. Friend and collaborater [[Peter Wolfe (musician)|Peter Wolfe]] had a guest appearance on stage when Doherty performed "[[For Lovers]]". Wolfe's performance however did not meet critical acclaim. [[The Daily Telegraph]] stated Wolfe would have ruined the song with "some especially tuneless backing vocals".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/07/14/bmpete114.xml | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Pete Doherty's bloom lost in space | first=Jon | last=Swaine | date=2008-07-14 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> The gig was forced to an abrupt end during the encore due to a stage invasion by the fans.<ref>[http://www.gigwise.com/article?id=44573&image=2#gallery GIGWISE, Pete Doherty Royal Albert Hall Show Hit By Stage Invasion<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On 13 January 2009, NME.COM announced that Doherty's solo album, entitled ''[[Grace/Wastelands]]'' would be released on 16 March, preceded by a single, "[[Last of the English Roses]]", on 9 March. The website also revealed the tracklisting of the album and credits. In 2009 Doherty was made an honorary patron of the [[University Philosophical Society]].

Whilst performing a solo gig at the [[Grimsby]] Auditorium in March 2009, Doherty declared Grimsby a "shit-hole" mid-way through his set after being continuously pelted with coins and drinks by a harsh{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} crowd.

===Modelling===
Following in the footsteps of model and ex-fianc<U+00E9>e [[Kate Moss]], Doherty became the face of [[Roberto Cavalli]]'s Fall 2007/2008 fashion advertising campaign. The photos gained praise for depicting a much cleaner and more handsome Doherty. The '50s-style photographs have also been compared to images of [[Marlon Brando]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/25/nmoss125.xml |title=Doherty becomes fashion contender for Moss |accessdate=2007-06-29 |last=Alexander |first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Alexander |date=2007-06-27 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London}}</ref>

==Influences==
In interviews, Doherty has listed his favourite books as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'', ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'' by [[Graham Greene]], ''[[Our Lady of the Flowers]]'' by [[Jean Genet]], ''[[Les Fleurs du mal|Flowers of Evil]]'' by [[Charles Baudelaire]] and the complete works of [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref name="q+a2003">{{cite web

Doherty mentions Hancock, and makes an allusion to his famous phrase 'Stone me!', in an early song entitled "You're My Waterloo". However, numerous literary and musical allusions occur throughout Doherty's ongoing ''Books of Albion''. He places particular importance on the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]] and on existential philosophers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]]. Doherty has also alluded to work by the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Thomas de Quincey]]. On the Babyshambles album ''[[Down in Albion]]'', there is a track entitled "<U+00C0> rebours", which is significantly influenced by [[<U+00C0> rebours|the novel of the same name]] by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]].<ref name="MotherInterview">{{cite news

Doherty is also known to be a devoted follower of [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] football club. As a youth he wrote a fanzine, entitled "All Quiet on the [[Western Avenue (London)|Western Avenue]]".<ref name="MotherInterview"/> He sold copies of the fanzine on the club's grounds, but its mixture of literary references, quotes, poetry and football stories proved unsuccessful with the other fans.

A frequent lyrical theme for Doherty is [[Albion]], the ancient name for Great Britain. Doherty also uses 'Albion' as the name of a ship sailing to a utopia called [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a place without rules or authority. Doherty and Bar<U+00E2>t shared a flat in London, at 112a Teesdale Street, [[Bethnal Green]], affectionately known as 'The Albion Rooms', despite being rather run down.

In 2003, while Doherty's first band [[The Libertines]] were performing in Japan, he broke into Carl Bar<U+00E2>t's flat and stole various items, including an old guitar and a laptop computer. On 7 September Doherty was sentenced by Judge Roger Davies to 6 months in prison, however the sentence was eventually shortened to two months on appeal with the judge commenting, "We feel that a custodial sentence was justified in this case but sufficient credit was not given for his timely plea of guilty which it should have been. We have reduced his sentence to two months which will allow for his almost immediate release." Doherty was released from jail on 8 October.<ref>{{cite news

On 8 April 2008, Doherty was jailed for 14 weeks by a court for breaching a probation order after a string of brushes with the law for drugs and driving offenses. On the 18 April 2008, he was moved to a private area of [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs prison]] after learning that fellow inmates were planning to attack him, therefore making it safer for the singer. On 6 May 2008, he was released after his sentence was cut in half and further 18 days were remitted due to a government plan to reduce overcrowding. He also had another 2 days off for being in police custody (after serving just over 4 weeks of a 14-week sentence). He described prison life as "a lot of gangsters and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]" and showed a certificate confirming he had passed a [[drugs test]] while inside.<ref name="afp111">{{cite news

After numerous attempts to convince him to start a serious rehab, in early 2005 Doherty's father decided that he was tired of broken promises and vowed never to see his son until he was clean of drugs. The sensitivity surrounding the issue became apparent in the [[BBC Two]] ''[[Arena (TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary about Doherty, on 12 November 2006, which included footage of him talking about this aspect of his personal life. He was visibly upset and had to politely ask the interviewer at one point to stop filming. In October 2007, Doherty said in an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]] show, ''Front Row'', that he briefly reconciled with his father after 3 years of no contact when his father came to visit him in rehab, but they are currently estranged due to his ongoing difficulties with drugs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7042330.stm |title=Doherty 'at drugs turning point' |accessdate=2007-11-02 |date=2007-10-12 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> In a radio interview in France on July 6, 2009, Doherty stated that 'I'm clean <U+2013> the last 11 days I've been clean for the first time in quite a long time.' Doherty also stated that 'as we speak' work has begun on the third [[Babyshambles]] album, stating that he was keen to begin writing while he was clean, however he displayed some anxiety at writing music while clean due to the fact many of his songs have been written under the influence.

Doherty has had a tumultuous relationship with Kate Moss, frequently covered by the press. They met in January 2005 at Moss' 31st birthday party and have had an on-off relationship since. Moss has also taken to singing at some of Doherty's shows.<ref name="on stage with Moss">{{cite news
