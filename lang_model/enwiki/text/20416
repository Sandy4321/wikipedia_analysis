'''Milton State Park''' is an {{convert|82|acre}} [[List of Pennsylvania state parks|Pennsylvania state park]] in [[Milton, Pennsylvania|Milton]] in [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]]. The park is on Montgomery Island in the [[West Branch Susquehanna River]], just east of the village of West Milton in [[Union County, Pennsylvania|Union County]].  Milton State Park is on [[Pennsylvania Route 642]].

==History==
The recorded history of Milton State Park begins in 1762 when Marcus Huling Jr. made a claim on the island in the West Branch Susquehanna River.  Huling planted an [[apple]] [[orchard]] on what was to become known as Montgomery Island.<ref name="miltonsp">{{cite web

Ownership of the island eventually transferred to the Straub Family. The Straubs built a [[dam]] across part of the river in 1824. The Straubs ran a [[sawmill]] and [[gristmill]] on the island and built a bridge between the island to the banks of the West Branch Susquehanna River.<ref name="miltonsp"/> In time, the mills closed and the land was used for [[Agriculture|farming]]. The island was no longer used for farming by the early 1900s.<ref name="miltonsp"/>  

Over the next 60 years the island was divided among several owners and used as a picnic ground with several athletic fields. The Milton [[Rotary Club]] and the Borough of Milton worked together to consolidate the deeds and transferred ownership of Montgomery Island to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1966.<ref name="miltonsp"/>

[[Hurricane Agnes]] wiped out the newly created Milton State Park in 1972. The island and much of [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[Susquehanna River]] watershed was flooded extensively by the [[hurricane]]. The park was eventually rebuilt with federal disaster relief funds.<ref name="miltonsp"/>

==Nature==

Milton State Park is within sight of [[downtown]] Milton, Pennsylvania. This does not mean that it lacks for natural beauty.  The island is surrounded by the waters of the West Branch Susquehanna River and the southern part of the island is not developed. It is covered in a forest of [[river birch]], [[silver maple]] and [[American Sycamore|sycamore]] trees. Milton State Park is a haven for migrating [[bird]]s and [[waterfowl]].<ref name="miltonsp"/>

==Recreation==
There are several [[soccer]] and [[softball]] fields that are used by the residents of West Milton and Milton for recreational and church league events. Montgomery Island is stopping point for those exploring the river in [[canoes]] and [[kayaks]]. Milton State Park is handy to the fisherman interested in taking a short trip from Milton or West Milton for a day of fishing for [[catfish]], [[panfish]], [[Bass (fish)|bass]], [[northern pike]] and [[muskellunge]]. There is {{convert|1|mi}} of hiking trail on the northern side of the park.<ref name="miltonsp"/>

The northern side of the park has ample picnic facilities. Families will find many picnic tables and charcoal grills for their use. There also is access to fresh drinking water and restroom facilities.<ref name="miltonsp"/>
