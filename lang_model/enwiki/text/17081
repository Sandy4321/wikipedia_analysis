== History ==
Gunnison residents isolated themselves from the surrounding area during the [[Spanish Influenza]] epidemic for two months at the end of 1918.  All highways were barricaded near the county lines.  Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped outside of the train in Gunnison, they would be arrested and quarantined for five days.  As a result of the isolation, no one died of influenza in Gunnison during the epidemic. This served as partial inspiration for the novel ''[[The Last Town on Earth]]''.

==Geography==
[[File:Welcome to Gunnison (from the East).JPG|thumb|Welcome to Gunnison sign for travelers on Hwy 50 entering Gunnison from the east.]]
Gunnison County is situated at an [[altitude]] of {{convert|7703|ft}}.<ref name=GNIS/>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|3.2|sqmi}}. All of it is land and none of it is covered by water. Gunnison is near [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]]. One can travel to Gunnison from the towns of [[Salida, Colorado|Salida]] and [[Buena Vista, Colorado|Buena Vista]] by going over [[Monarch Pass]]. [[U.S. Route 50 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 50]] is the main east-west thoroughfare through the town. At the 2010 Census the there was a population of 15,324 within the county.

=== Climate ===
Gunnison is located at the bottom of several valleys. Due to its location in the [[Rocky Mountains]], cold air in all the valleys settles into Gunnison at night, making it one of the coldest places in winter in the United States, especially when snowpack is present. The average January low is {{convert|-8|F}}, and the average July high is {{convert|82|F}}. The record low is {{convert|-60|F}}, recorded at [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]]. The record high is {{convert|98|F}}, set on August 15, 1931.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliGCStT.pl?cogunn |title=GUNNISON 1 N, COLORADO Period of Record General Climate Summary - Temperature |date=28 July 2006 |publisher=Western Regional Climate Center |accessdate=7 January 2011}}</ref>

The city typically experiences moderate snowfalls, with an average of {{convert|50|in|cm}} per year. Early fall and late spring snows are not uncommon, and snow can remain on the ground in town from as early as November to as late as April. Surrounding mountains experience very heavy snowfall with longer periods of snow on the ground. Many locations average {{convert|300|-|400|in|cm}} of snow annually. The snow is welcome to the area, as it is beneficial to water supplies and local ski resorts. Total liquid precipitation averages nearly {{convert|11|in}} per year in the city of Gunnison, while surrounding mountains may receive anywhere from 15 to over 40&nbsp;inches (380 to 1,000&nbsp;mm) annually, depending upon elevation and local topography.

Gunnison is home to [[Western State College of Colorado|Western State Colorado University]] which received its third renaming since its beginnings from an approval of [[John Hickenlooper|Governor John Wright Hickenlooper]] on August 1, 2012. The college was originally founded as '''The Colorado State Normal School for Children''' by a bill signed on April 16, 1901 by Governor [[James B. Orman]]. In 1923, the college's name was changed to '''Western State College''' because its role expanded from a teaching institution to a liberal arts college.
