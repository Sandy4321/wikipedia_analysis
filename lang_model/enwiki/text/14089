This page is concerned with the holders of the extinct title '''Earl of Douglas''' and the preceding [[feudal baron]]s of [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire]]. The title was created in the [[Peerage of Scotland|Peerage]] of [[Scotland]] in 1358 for [[William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas]], son of [[Sir Archibald Douglas]], [[Guardian of Scotland]]. The Earldom was forfeited by [[James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas]] in 1455.

==Origins==
The Earls of Douglas and their successors claimed descent from [[Sholto Douglas]], a mythical figure dated by Godscroft to 767 AD.<ref> Godscroft, pp 1-6</ref> However, it is more likely that they were descendants of [[Flemish people|Flemish]] immigrants to Scotland, during the reign of [[David I of Scotland|David I]]. <ref> Maxwell, Vol I, chap I, pp.1-12</ref> Through the marriage of William the Hardy, grandfather of the 1st Earl, to Eleanor de Lovaine, The Earls of Douglas could trace their ancestry to the [[Dukes of Brabant|Landgraves of Brabant]], the [[County of Hainaut|Counts of Hainaut]],  and through them to [[Charles the Bald]], grandson of the emperor [[Charlemagne]]. In the story of Sholto Douglas, his son William Douglas is a commander of forces sent by the mythical Scottish king [[Achaius]] (Eochaid?), to the court of Charlemagne to aid him in his wars against [[Desiderius]], King of the [[Lombards]]. William Douglas is said to have settled in [[Piacenza]] where his descendants became powerful local magnates, and eventual leaders of the [[Guelf]] faction of that city.<ref>Godscroft, pp. 7-14</ref>

==Black and Red Douglases==

Following the death of the 2nd Earl at the [[Battle of Otterburn]] in 1388 without legitimate issue, the Earldom passed to a bastard son of 'The Good Sir James', the poetically named [[Archibald the Grim]], the [[Lord of Galloway]]. This occurred through articles of special [[Fee tail|entail]] in the resignation of title by [[Hugh the Dull, Lord of Douglas]]. [[George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus]] the bastard son of the 1st Earl by his sister-in law [[Margaret Stewart, 4th Countess of Angus|Margaret Stewart, Dowager Countess of Mar & Countess of Angus]], inherited his mother's Earldom of Angus.
Retrospectively the two branches of Douglas and Angus were described as the '''Black''' and '''Red''' lines respectively. 

The Black Douglases fell from power and were attainted by King [[James II of Scotland|James II]] in 1455.
The seventh Earl was created '''Earl of Avondale''' and '''Lord Balveny''' in 1437, also in the [[Peerage of Scotland]]. These titles also became forfeit in 1455.

The title of Douglas was restored in 1633 for the 'Red' Douglas line, when [[William Douglas, 11th Earl of Angus]] (1589-1660), was created First Marquess of Douglas by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].
