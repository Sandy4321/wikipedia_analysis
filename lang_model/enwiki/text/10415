{{otheruses4|the ancient Greek playwright}}

'''Aeschylus'''  ([[Greek language|Greek]]: '''<U+0391>{{polytonic|&#x1f30;}}<U+03C3><U+03C7><U+03CD><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>''', [[IPA]]: {{IPA|/<U+02C8><U+025B>sk<U+0259>l<U+0259>s/}} or {{IPA|/<U+02C8>isk<U+0259>l<U+0259>s/}}, 525&ndash;456 BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[playwright]]. He is often recognized as the father or the founder of tragedy,<ref name="F243">Freeman, Page 243</ref><ref>P.W. Buckham, p.121., quoting from ''Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature'' by [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel]]. "''Aeschylus is to be considered as the creator of Tragedy: in full panoply she sprung from his head, like Pallas from the head of Jupiter. He clad her with dignity, and gave her an appropriate stage; he was the inventor of scenic pomp, and not only instructed the chorus in singing and dancing, but appeared himself as an actor. He was the first that expanded the dialogue, and set limits to the lyrical part of tragedy, which, however, still occupies too much space in his pieces.''"</ref> and is the earliest of the three [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]] whose [[play]]s survive, the others being [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. His contributions to the art of drama include expanding the number of characters in plays from one to two, which allowed conflict and interaction between characters rather than limiting plays to dialogue between one character and the [[Greek chorus|chorus]]. Unfortunately, only seven of an estimated 70 plays by Aeschylus have survived into modern times; one of these plays, the ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', is sometimes thought not to be the work of Aeschylus.

Aeschylus' life and career took place in the context of the [[Persian Wars|Persian invasion of Greece]], which influenced the subject matter of many of his works. His play ''[[The Persians]]'' remains an important primary source of information about this period in Greek history. The war was so important to Greeks and to Aeschylus himself that, upon his death around 456 BC, his epitaph included reference to his participation in the Greek victory at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] but not to his success as a playwright.

==Life==
[[Image:Darius.jpg|left|thumb|125px|The Persian King [[Darius]], whose army Aeschylus fought in the [[Battle of Marathon]]]]

Aeschylus was born in either 525 or 524 BC in [[Eleusis]], a small town about 30 kilometers northwest of [[Athens]], which nestled in the fertile valleys of western [[Attica]].<ref name="S33">Sommerstein, Page 33</ref> His family was both wealthy and well-established; his father Euphorion was a member of the [[Eupatridae]], the ancient nobility of Attica.<ref name="Bates">Bates, Pages 53-59</ref> As a youth, he worked at a [[vineyard]] until, he later claimed to his friend [[Pausanias]], the god [[Dionysus]] visited him in his sleep and commanded him to turn his attention to the nascent art of tragedy.<ref name=Bates/> The young Aeschylus began writing a tragedy as soon as he woke, and his first performance took place in 499 BC, when he was only 26 years old.<ref name=Bates/><ref name=S33/> After fifteen years, his skill was great enough to win a prize for his plays at Athens' annual City Dionysia, a festival dedicated to Dionysus.<ref name=Bates/><ref name="F241">Freeman, Page 241</ref>

In 490 BC, Aeschylus and his brother Cynegeirus fought with the Greek army against the massive invading army of the [[Persian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Marathon]].<ref name=S33/> This pivotal defeat of the Persian King [[Darius]]' invading horde by the outnumbered soldiers of the Greek [[Delian League]] ended the first Persian invasion of Greece proper and was celebrated across the city-states of Greece.<ref name=S33/> However, the glory was tempered for Aeschylus personally when his brother was killed in the battle.<ref name=S33/> Aeschylus continued to write plays during the lull between the first and second Persian invasions of Greece, and won his first victory in the City [[Dionysia]], Athens' annual competition of playwrights, in 484 BC.<ref name=S33/> In 480 and 479 BC, he again fought with the Greek armies against [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]' invading forces at the Battles of [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] and [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]].<ref name=S33/> The crushing Athenian victory over the Persian fleet at Salamis was to become the subject of ''The Persians'', his oldest surviving [[play]], which was performed in 472 BC and won first prize.<ref name="S34">Sommerstein, Page 34</ref> 

Aeschylus traveled to [[Sicily]] once or twice in the 470s BC, having been invited by [[Hieron]] of Syracuse, a major Greek city on the eastern side of the island.<ref name=S33/> By 473 BC, after the death of Phrynichus, one of his chief rivals, Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia, winning first prize in nearly every competition.<ref name=S33/> In 458 BC, he returned to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of [[Gela]] where he died in 456 or 455 BC.<ref name=S33/> He would continue to be honored by the Athenians, who respected his work so highly that they allowed other playwrights to reproduce his plays as part of the Dionysia rather than presenting original works of their own.<ref name=S33/> His sons Euphorion and Eu<U+00E6>on and his nephew Philocles would follow in his footsteps to become playwrights themselves.<ref name=S33/>

The inscription on Aeschylus' gravestone may have been written by him, but makes no mention of his [[theater|theatrical]] renown, commemorating only his military achievements:

==Works==
[[Image:Athen Dionysos-Theater.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A modern picture of the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, where many of Aeschylus' plays were performed]]

The Greek art of the drama had its roots in religious festivals celebrated for the gods, chiefly [[Dionysus]], the god of wine.<ref name=F241/> In Athens, the two major theatre festivals were the [[Lenaia]] in January and the more important [[Dionysia]] in the spring.<ref name=F241/> These festivals began with an opening procession, continued with a competition of boys singing [[dithyramb]]s, and culminated in a pair of dramatic competitions.<ref name="F242">Freeman, Page 242</ref> The first competition, which Aeschylus would have participated in, was for the tragedians, and consisted of three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedic [[satyr play]].<ref name=F242/> There followed a second competition of five comedic playwrights like [[Aristophanes]], and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a panel of judges.<ref name=F242/>

Aeschylus entered many of these competitions in his lifetime, and it is estimated that he wrote somewhere between 70 to 90 plays.<ref>There is diagreement among scholars concerning the total number of plays. For example, Freeman (page 243) claims around 90 while Pomeroy et. al. (Page 222) claim 'perhaps seventy plays'.</ref> Only seven tragedies have survived intact into the modern era: the ''[[Persians]]'', the ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'', the ''[[The Suppliants|Suppliants]]'', the trilogy known as the ''[[Oresteia]]'', consisting of the three tragedies ''[[Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Libation Bearers|Libation Bearers]]'' and ''[[Eumenides]]'', and the ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', which may not be by Aeschylus (see below). Fragments of other tragedies and satyr plays have survived as quotations in other works or in [[papyri]] found in Egypt.

The earliest of these that still exists is ''[[The Persians]]'' (''Persai''), performed in 472 BC and based on experiences in Aeschylus' own life, specifically the [[Battle of Salamis]].<ref name="F244">Freeman, Page 244</ref> It is unique both in its aforementioned importance for historians of the Persian Wars but also because the majority of Greek plays of that era concerned stories about the gods rather than stories of earthly events.<ref name=F243/> ''The Persians'', though, does focus on the popular Greek theme of hubris, blaming Persia's loss in the war on the overwhelming pride of its king.<ref name=F244/>

The theme of the gods interfering in human affairs, and placing them in difficult situations, continues in ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'' (''Hepta epi Thebas''), which was performed in 467 BC.<ref name=F244/> Its tragic story of a war between [[Thebes]] and [[Argos]] also marks the first known appearance in Aeschylus' work of a theme which would continue through his plays, that of the [[polis]] (the city or citizenship) as the highest development of human civilization.<ref name="F244246">Freeman, Pages 244-246</ref> He would continue that theme with ''[[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]]'' in 463 BC (''Hiketides''), which pays tribute to the democratic undercurrents running through Athens in advance of the establishment of a democratic government in 461.<ref name="F246">Freeman, Page 246</ref>

The most complete [[tetralogy]] of Aeschylus' work that still exists is the ''[[Oresteia]]'' (458 BC), of which only the satyr play is missing.<ref name=F244/> In fact, the ''Oresteia'' is the only full trilogy of Greek plays by any playwright that modern scholars have uncovered.<ref name=F244/> The trilogy consists of ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Libation Bearers]]'' (''Choephoroi''), and ''[[The Eumenides]]''.<ref name=F244246/> The trilogy tells the bloody story of the family of [[Agamemnon]], his death at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]], her death at the hands of their son [[Orestes]], and the question of Orestes' guilt.<ref name=F244246/> ''The Eumenides'' specifically extols the importance of reason in the development of laws, and like ''The Supplicants'' lauds the ideals of a democratic Athens.<ref name=F246/>

In addition to these six works, a seventh tragedy, the ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', is usually thought to be by Aeschylus, although there is debate among modern scholars as to whether it was written by another author.<ref name=S33/><ref>According to Griffith (p. 32), "Most modern scholars have seen no good reason to doubt the traditional ascription, though opinions as to date have varied." He adds that "we cannot hope for certainty one way or the other" (p. 34).</ref> Lost and fragmentary works of Aeschylus include ''Phineas'', ''Glaukos Potnieus'' and ''Prometheus Pyrkaeus'', a [[satyr play]], belonging to the same tetralogy as [[The Persians]]; ''Laios'', ''Oedipus'' and ''Sphynx'', another satyr play, belonging to the same tetralogy as [[Seven Against Thebes]]; ''Proteus'', the satyr play belonging to the Oresteia tetralogy; ''Eleusians'' and ''The Net-pullers''.

When Aeschylus first began writing, the theatre had only just begun to evolve, although earlier playwrights like [[Thespis]] had expanded the cast to include an actor who was able to interact with the [[Greek chorus|chorus]].<ref name="P222">Pomeroy, Page 222</ref> Aeschylus added a second actor, such that the actors themselves could have conflicts and engage in dialogue, while the chorus took less immediate a role.<ref name=P222/> Overall, though, he continued to write within the very strict bounds of Greek drama: his plays were written in verse, no violence could be performed on stage, and the plays had to have a certain remoteness from daily life in Athens, either by relating stories about the gods or by being set, like ''The Persians'' in far-away locales.<ref name="P223">Pomeroy, Page 223</ref>

Aeschylus' work has a strong moral and religious emphasis.<ref name=P223/> The ''Oresteia'' trilogy particularly concentrated on man's position in the cosmos in relation to the gods, divine law, and divine punishment.<ref>Pomeroy, Pages 224-225</ref> Scholars assume that the weighty themes of his plays were intended to inspire thought and conversation among Athenian audiences, but almost no sources exist that describe how audiences engaged intellectually with Greek theater.<ref name=P223/> What is certain, though, is the high regard in which Aeschylus was held by the Athenians.<ref name=P222/> For many years following his death, the epic and prize-winning plays of Aeschylus continued to be performed by actors and actresses for the festival audiences of Athens.<ref name=P222/>
