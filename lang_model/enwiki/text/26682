'''Take Charge Lady''' (foaled 4 February 1999) is an American [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse and [[Horse breeding#Terminology|broodmare]]. She was one of the leading fillies of her generation in the United States, winning eleven of her twenty-two races between April 2001 and November 2003. She recorded [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] victories in the [[Ashland Stakes]] and consecutive editions of the [[Spinster Stakes]], and also won the [[Alcibiades Stakes]], [[Silverbulletday Stakes]], [[Fair Grounds Oaks]], [[Dogwood Stakes]] and [[Arlington Matron Stakes]].

After her retirement from racing she became a very successful boodmare, producing the Grade I winners [[Take Charge Indy]] and [[Will Take Charge]]. In addition, her first foal Charming is the dam of the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] winner [[Take Charge Brandi]].

==Racing career==
===2001: two-year-old season===
Take Charge Lady was ridden in most of her early races by Tony d'Amico. The filly made her debut by winning a [[maiden race]] at [[Keeneland]] in April, but was then off the track for almost five months before returning to win an [[allowance race]] over one mile at [[Turfway Park]] in September. Four weeks later Take Charge Lady was moved up in class distance and started at odds of [[Fractional odds|5.8/1]] for the [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] Alcibiades Stakes over eight and a half furlong at Keeneland. D'Amico tracked the favorite Never Out before sending his mount into the lead early in the stretch and winning by a length.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=KEE&dt=10/05/2001&ctry=USA&race=6 |title=Alcibiades Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=October 5, 2001 |accessdate=}}</ref> McPeek described the winner as "just class top to bottom... she's very, very, very special", before adding "I'm just trying to keep from messing her up".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/6213/take-charge-lady-lives-up-to-name-in-alcibiades|title=Take Charge Lady Lives Up to Name in Alcibiades|date=5 October 2001|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>

Take Charge Lady was stepped up again on 27 October for the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] at [[Belmont Park]] and was made the 11/1 fourth choice in the betting behind the [[Frizette Stakes]] winner [[You (horse)|You]], Bella Bellucci and Habibti. She disputed the lead in the early stages but faded in the second half of the race and finished sixth of the nine runner behind [[Tempera (horse)|Tempera]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=308132&r_date=2001-10-27&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS|title=Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies|publisher=Racing Post|date=27 October 2001|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> On her final appearance of the season, the filly started favorite for the Grade II [[Golden Rod Stakes]] at [[Churchill Downs]] but was beaten four and a half lengths by the [[Carl Nafzger]]-trained Belterra, to whom she was conceding five pounds.

===2002: three-year-old season===
Take Charge Lady began her second season with two races at [[Fair Grounds Race Course]] in [[New Orleans]]. Jon Court took over the ride from D'Amico when the filly made her seasonal debut in the Grade III Silverbulletday Stakes over one and one sixteenth of a mile on February 16. Starting the 1.6/1 favorite, she led from the start and drew away from her four opponents to win by eight and a half lengths from Charmed Gift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=FG&dt=02/16/2002&ctry=USA&race=9 |title=Silverbulletday Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=February 16, 2002 |accessdate=}}</ref> Her winning time of 1:42.09 equaled the track record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/8118/take-charge-lady-in-charge-at-fair-grounds|title=Take Charge Lady In Charge at Fair Grounds|date=16 February 2002|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> Take Charge Lady was reunited with D'Amico and started 1/2 favorite for the Grade II Fair Grounds Oaks over the same distance three weeks later. Racing on a sloppy track, she took the lead soon after the start and accelerated clear in the stretch to win by five length from Lake Lady.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=FG&dt=03/09/2002&ctry=USA&race=9 |title=Fair Grounds Oaks result |publisher=equibase |date=March 9, 2002 |accessdate=}}</ref> Following the race D'Amico said that the winner was "turning into something extraordinary" whilst owner Jerry Bach was jubilant after winning the [[Louisiana Derby]] with Repent earlier on the card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/8496/fair-grounds-race-report-re-energized|title=Fair Grounds Race Report: Re-Energized|author=Gary McMillen|date=10 March 2002|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> On April 6 the filly was moved back into Grade I class and faced a rematch with Belterra in the Ashland Stakes (a trial race for the [[Kentucky Oaks]]) at Keeneland. She recovered from being bumped at the start to overtake Colonial Glitter at half-distance, went clear of the field entering the stretch, and won by four and a quarter lengths from Take the Cake, with Belterra a further two and a half lengths back in third place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=KEE&dt=04/06/2002&ctry=USA&race=8 |title=Ashland Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=April 6, 2002 |accessdate=}}</ref> The filly's success gave D'Amico his first at Grade I level and gave him compensation for losing the rides on the [[Kentucky Derby]] contenders Repent and [[Harlan's Holiday]]. He commented; "This is just a remarkable day for me. It takes a lot of the pain away".<ref name="ashland"/>

McPeek considered running the filly against [[colt (horse)|colts]] in the Kentucky Derby,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/8977/take-charge-lady-probably-still-headed-for-oaks|title=Take Charge Lady Probably Still Headed For Oaks|author=Deirdre B. Biles|date=7 April 2002|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> but opted instead to contest the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs on May 3. Take Charge Lady started the 1.6/1 favorite ahead You, Imperial Gesture (winner of the [[UAE Oaks]]) and Habibti in a nine runner field. She took the lead soon after the start and went two lengths clear of her opponents in the straight but was caught a hundred yards from the finish and beaten one and a quarter lengths by the 20/1 outsider [[Farda Amiga]]. After being ruled out of the [[Black-Eyed Susan Stakes]] by a lung infection,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/9585/infection-knocks-take-charge-lady-out-of-black-eyed-susan|title=Infection Knocks Take Charge Lady Out of Black-Eyed Susan|date=14 May 2002|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> the filly was then dropped in class for the Grade III Dogwood Stakes at the same course three weeks later. Starting the 0.3/1 favorite, she raced in second place behind French Satin before taking the lead entering the second turn, going three lengths clear before being eased down to win by one and three quarter lengths from Charmed Gift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=CD&dt=05/25/2002&ctry=USA&race=9 |title=Dogwood Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=May 25, 2013 |accessdate=}}</ref> Immediately after the race McPeek expressed his opinion that the filly was capable of winning the [[Breeders' Cup Ditaff]] and the [[Eclipse Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/9781/churchill-downs-race-report-belle-of-louisville|title=Churchill Downs Race Report: Belle of Louisville|author=Leslie Deckard|date=25 May 2002|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> Plans to run Take Charge Lady in the [[Mother Goose Stakes]] were abandoned after McPeek became concerned by the filly's condition. He explained that she had she had not been eating well and that blood tests had shown her to be "a touch dehydrated".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/10159/take-charge-lady-gets-time-off|title=Take Charge Lady Gets Time Off|author=Kristin Ingwell Goode|date=19 June 2002|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>

After a break of three and a half months, Take Charge Lady returned in September in the Grade I [[Gazelle Stakes]] over nine furlongs at [[Belmont Park]] in which she was ridden for the first time by [[Edgar Prado]] who became her regular jockey. Carrying top weight of 121 pounds, she tracked the wire-to-wire winner Imperial Gesture throughout the race before finishing second, two and a half lengths behind the winner, but six lengths clear of the favorite Bella Bellucci in third. Take Charge Lady was then matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Spinster Stakes at Keeneland on October 6. She started 11/10 favorite against opponents including You, Dancethruthedawn ([[Go For Wand Handicap]]) and Victory Ride ([[Test Stakes]]). Prado restrained the filly on the inside rail before moving up on the final turn to take the lead from You and took a clear advantage in the stretch to win by two and a half lengths from her fellow three-year-old with the five-year-old [[Chilean]] mare Printemps in third.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=KEE&dt=10/06/2002&ctry=USA&race=8 |title=Spinster Stakes 2002 result |publisher=equibase |date=October 6, 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> Prado said that the winner "took off like a rocket", whilst You's jockey [[Kent Desormeaux]] admitted that Take Charge Lady was "just too good".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/11909/keeneland-race-report-all-charged-up|title=Keeneland Race Report: All Charged Up|author=Lenny Shulman|date=6 October 2002|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> 

At [[Arlington Park]] twenty days later, the filly started second favorite for the nineteenth running of the [[Breeders' Cup Distaff]]. Drawn on the outside of the eight-runner field she raced in third place but tired in the closing stages to finish sixth behind the favorite [[Azeri (horse)|Azeri]] beaten more than thirteen lengths by the winner. She was later found to have been suffering from another lung infection.<ref name="KTB">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/17917/orientate-take-charge-lady-ktm-award-winners|title=Orientate, Take Charge Lady KTM Award Winners|date=8 September 2003|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> On November 28 she started odds-on favorite under top weight of 122 pounds for the [[Falls City Handicap]] at Churchill Downs but was beaten one and quarter lengths by Allamerican Bertie. Take Charge Lady ended her season in the ungraded NTRA Great State Challenge Distaff Invitational Stakes at [[Sam Houston Race Park]] in Texas. Starting at odds of 1/10 she led from the start and won easily by three and a half lengths from three opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=HOU&dt=12/07/2002&ctry=USA&race=6 |title=NTRA Great State Challenge Distaff Invitational Stakes result |publisher=equibase |date=December 7, 2002 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>

===2003: four-year-old season===
On her first appearance as a four-year-old, Take Charge Lady was ridden for the first time by [[Shane Sellers]] (returing from a long injury layoff) when she contested the Grade I [[Apple Blossom Handicap]] at Oaklawn on April 5. She started quickly and led from the start, maintaining her advantage until the final strides when she was overtaken by Azeri and finished second by a head. After a two and a half month break partly necessitated by a training injury at Churchill Downs in May<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/15521/take-charge-lady-white-cat-scratched-from-churchill-stakes|title=Take Charge Lady, White Cat Scratched From Churchill Stakes|author=Deirdre B. Biles and Ron Mitchell|date=May 2, 2003|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref> the filly returned in the Grade I [[Ogden Phipps Handicap]] at Belmont Park on 21 June in which she was re-united with Prado. As in her previous appearance she set the pace before being overtaken in the straight: on this occasion she was beaten five lengths by the [[Robert Frankel]]-trained [[Sightseek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=335879&r_date=2003-06-21&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS|title=Ogden Phipps Handicap result|date=June 21, 2003|publisher=Racing Post|accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref> A month later she was dropped in class for the [[Delaware Handicap]] (then a Grade II race) and finished second for the third time running, beaten six lengths by the Chilean filly Wild Spirit after leading until the last quarter mile.

Take Charge Lady began her autumn campaign in the Grade III Arlington Matron Handicap on September 1. Ridden by Sellers she started the 0.3/1 favorite in a six-runner field, conceding at least six pounds to her opponents. After tracking the leader Fly Borboleta she took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away to win by eleven lengths from Lakenheath. Sellers commented "She's something else. She's a joy to ride. She's been the highlight of my comeback."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/17801/arlington-matron-belongs-to-take-charge-lady|title=Arlington Matron Belongs to Take Charge Lady|author=Jack Shinar|date=1 September 2003|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> On October 5 at Keeneland, Take Charge Lady attempted to become the fourth horse after Bornatar, [[Susan's Girl]] and [[Bayakoa]] to win the Spinster Stakes for a second time. She was made the 1/2 favorite ahead of You, and four others including Desert Gold and Printemps: there were no three-year-olds in the six-runner field. After racing just behind the leaders, Prado sent the filly into the lead on the penultimate turn, opened up a clear advantage entering the straight and held off the renewed challenge of You to win by a head, with a gap of four lengths back to Miss Linda in third place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=KEE&dt=10/05/2003&ctry=USA&race=8 |title=Spinster Stakes 2003 result |publisher=equibase |date=October 5, 2003 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> After the race Prado said "She got a little tired the last seventy yards but these kind of horses give you everything to the wire. It was a game performance".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/18401/take-charge-lady-controls-you-in-spinster|title=Take Charge Lady Controls You in Spinster|author=Blood-Horse Staff|date=6 October 2003|work=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> Three weeks later Take Charge Lady made her second bid to win the Breeders' Cup Distaff, which was run that year at [[Santa Anita Park]] and started the 8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Sightseek, Got Koko and Elloluv. She raced just behind the leaders in the early stages, but dropped away in the second half of the race and finished sixth of the seven runners behind the 40/1 outsider [[Adoration (horse)|Adoration]]. Take Charge Lady was reunited with her first jockey, Joe D'Amico, when she made her last track appearance in the Falls River Handicap on November 27. She started odds-on favorite despite carrying top weight of 123 pounds, but tired in the closing stages and finished fifth of the ten runners behind Lead Story.

Her retirement was announced on December 2. Jerry Bach commented "Take Charge Lady has done more than enough on the track and it's time for her to embark on her new career. She's a very honest filly and has given us one thrill after another".<ref name="retirement"/>
