Introduced in [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], it is among the [[Final Fantasy X#Reception|top twenty best-selling console games]] of all time, having sold in excess of 7.75 million copies worldwide. Set in the [[fantasy]] world of [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)|Spira]], the game's story centers around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging force known as "[[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#The history of Spira|Sin]]." 

The game is significant in that it marks the transition from entirely [[pre-rendered]] backdrops to fully three-dimensional areas with the PlayStation 2<U+2019>s robust graphical capabilities (although two-dimensional backdrops are present in certain building interiors). It is the first in the series to feature a wide range of realistic facial expressions, as well as other technological developments in graphical effects, such as variance in lighting and shadow from one section of a character's clothing to the next.<ref name="interviews">{{cite web | author=Square Enix North America Site Staff | year=2001 | title=Behind The Game The Creators | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1 | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/na/ Square Enix North America] | accessdate=12 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy X'' is also the first in the series to feature [[voice-over]] actors, as well as the first to spawn a direct [[sequel]], ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''.

''Final Fantasy X'' also marks a number of other significant advances in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. For instance, because of the implementation of voice-overs, scenes in the game are paced according to the time taken for dialogue to be spoken,<ref name="interviews" /> whereas previous games of the series incorporated scrolling subtitles. ''Final Fantasy X'' also features changes in world design, with the focus now placed on realism. The gameplay also makes a significant departure from past games, with several new elements incorporated.

==Gameplay==
Like previous games in the series, ''Final Fantasy X'' is presented in [[Grammatical person#Use of grammatical person in creative media|third person perspective]], with players directly navigating the main character Tidus around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike in previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities now rendered to scale. Upon encountering an enemy, the environment switches to a [[Turn-based strategy|turn-based]] "battle arena" where characters and enemies must await their turn to attack.

In line with previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles, players are given the opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional [[experience point|experience point system]] has been replaced by a new system called the "Sphere Grid." The gameplay was also to feature [[Internet|online]] elements, but these were dropped during production, and [[Multiplayer game|online gaming]] would not become part of the ''Final Fantasy'' series until ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''.<ref name="online">{{cite web | author=Bill Johnson | year=2000 | title=Square Looks Ahead | url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2000/111700b.html | work=[http://rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessdate=29 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref name="online2">{{cite web | author=Jimmy Avistetto | year=2000 | title=Final Fantasy X Not Online-Capable | url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2000/112000b.html | work=[http://rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessdate=29 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Field map===
''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay differs from that of previous ''Final Fantasy'' games in its lack of an interactive [[top-down perspective]] "world map" navigation system. Instead, all game locations are physically contiguous and never fade out to an interactive world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, essentially forming a single path through the game's locations, however, an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate the world of Spira in a matter of seconds. Map director [[Takayoshi Nakazato]] has explained that with ''Final Fantasy X'' he wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional ''Final Fantasy'', in-line with the realism afforded by the mechanics of the game's dominant 3D backgrounds (as opposed to that offered by pre-rendered backgrounds, which he refers to as "pseudo 3D environments").<ref name="interviews" />

===Battle system===
''Final Fantasy X'' introduces the [[Conditional Turn-Based Battle System]] (CTB) in place of the series' traditional [[Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system. The CTB system is a truly turn-based system that pauses the battle on each of the player's turns, allowing an indefinite period of time to select an action, whereas the ATB system is comparable to a real-time system, necessitating fast selections, as characters' and enemies' turns are unaffected with their respective "wait gauges". The CTB system also allows characters' and enemies' attributes to affect the number of turns they are allowed and the order in which they occur. The game provides a graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen, detailing who will be receiving turns next, as well as how various actions taken (such as using the magical spell ''Slow'' on the enemy) will affect the subsequent order of turns. 

[[Image:Vortal pic 49415.jpg|thumb|left|An activated Overdrive awaiting button-inputs]]
Character-specific special abilities (known as "Desperation Moves" in ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', "[[Limit Break]]s" in ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'',  and "Trances" in ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'') reappear in ''Final Fantasy X'' under the name "[[Limit_Break#Limit_Breaks_in_Final_Fantasy_X|Overdrives]]." In this new incarnation of the system, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring [[fighting game]]-style button inputs or precise timing to increase their effectiveness. Furthermore, the game introduces Overdrive Modes, which allow the player to designate what circumstances (such as receiving damage, slaying an enemy, or being the only live character on the field) cause the Overdrive meter to fill. 

''Final Fantasy X'' introduces an overhaul of the [[Final Fantasy magic#Summon Magic|summoning]] system employed in the previous eight games in the series. Whereas in previous games a selected mystical creature would appear to perform a single action, summoned monsters in ''Final Fantasy X'' (called "[[List of Final Fantasy X characters#Aeons|aeons]]") arrive to take the place of the party in battle entirely, and for as long a duration as desired by the player before dismissed or slain. 

The player acquires five standards aeons over the course of the game, and several additional aeons can be unlocked by completing various sub-quests. Aeons have their own stats, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives, and can even be slain by the enemy. Aside from offering powerful attacks, they can also be employed to guard the party during battles against difficult bosses, as any damage received from the enemy while an aeon is present will be inflicted on the aeon instead of the party. 

Originally, ''Final Fantasy X'' was to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters.<ref name="battleandvoice">{{cite book | editor=BradyGAMES Staff | year = 2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide | pages=268 | publisher = BradyGAMES Publishing | language=English | id = ISBN 0-7440-0140-4}}</ref> Battle art director [[Shintaro Takai]] has explained that it was his intention that battles in ''Final Fantasy X'' come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element.<ref name="interviews" /> However, due to hardware and system limitations, these ideas (later dubbed "the [[Active Dimension Battle]] system") were not used until ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]''. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field screen to battle arenas were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game.

===Sphere Grid===
[[Image:FFXSphereGrid.jpg|thumb|right|The Sphere Grid]] 
''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s leveling system, the Sphere Grid, is unique in the [[computer role-playing game]] genre. Instead of characters gaining pre-determined [[statistic]] bonuses after a certain number of battles, each character gains a "sphere level" after collecting enough [[Experience point|Ability Points]] (AP). Sphere levels, in turn, allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a predetermined grid of several hundred interconnected nodes consisting of various [[Attribute (role-playing games)|stat]] and ability bonuses. Items called "spheres" (obtained from defeated enemies, treasure chests, and event prizes) are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character. In this way, the playable characters' development resembles a [[board game]].

Producer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand.<ref name="spheregrid">{{cite book | editor=BradyGAMES Staff | year = 2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Official Strategy Guide | pages=266 | publisher = BradyGAMES Publishing | language=English | id = ISBN 0-7440-0140-4}}</ref> The Sphere Grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the [[Summoner (character class)|summoner]]/[[White Mage]] [[Yuna]] into a physical powerhouse and the swordsman [[Auron]] into a healer. The ''International'' version of the game includes an optional "Expert" version of the Sphere Grid; in this version, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a tradeoff, however, the Expert grid has noticeably fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.

==Story==
{{seealso|Mythology of Final Fantasy X}}
''Final Fantasy X'' begins in the high-tech metropolis of [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Zanarkand Ruins|Zanarkand]], the home city of the main character, [[Tidus]]. When Zanarkand is suddenly attacked by a giant creature known as "Sin," Tidus <U+2014> along with his long-time mentor, [[Auron]] <U+2014> are sucked into the creature and Tidus awakens to find himself alone in the ruins of a deserted temple. Thus begins Tidus' quest to return to his homeland.

[[Image:Sin2.jpg|thumb|right|A side image of Sin]]{{spoiler}}
Rescued by some local divers, Tidus is told that his city was destroyed one thousand years in the past. He has little time to dwell on the significance of this news before Sin attacks again, however. Tidus eventually washes up near the small island of [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Besaid Island|Besaid]], where he meets [[Wakka]], captain of the local [[sport|sports]] team. Impressed with Tidus' prowess in the fictional sport of [[blitzball]], Wakka asks Tidus to join his team in an upcoming tournament and suggests that he may meet someone he knows there. 

During the voyage that follows, Tidus is introduced to [[Yuna]], a young woman who <U+2014> newly-inducted into the [[Summoner (character class)|summoner]]'s art <U+2014> possesses the power to call magical creatures called "[[List of Final Fantasy X characters#Aeons|aeons]]" to fight for her. Like all summoners, she is charged with the duty of defeating Sin, and is the daughter of [[List of Final Fantasy X characters|High Summoner Braska]], a man who temporarily vanquished Sin ten years prior. Tidus learns that Yuna's father was aided by Auron, his missing mentor, and [[Jecht]], Tidus' own long-lost father, who was assumed dead at sea ten years earlier.<ref name="jecht">'''Zanar:''' "I was in a coffee shop, running away from home when I heard the news. Our hero, Jecht, gone, vanished into thin air!" .../ '''Zanar:''' "Anyways... Ten years later, the Jecht Memorial Cup tournament is today!" (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref><ref name="jecht2">'''Tidus:''' "Sounds like him, but it can't be him." / '''Yuna:''' "Why not?" / '''Tidus:''' "My old man, he died. Ten years ago, off the coast of Zanarkand." / '''Yuna:''' "I'm sorry." / '''Tidus:''' "He went out to sea for training one day...and never came back. And no one's seen him since then." / '''Yuna:''' "Why, that's the day that Jecht came to Spira. It's true! I first met Jecht ten years and three months ago!" (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> He also meets [[Lulu (Final Fantasy X)|Lulu]] and [[Kimahri Ronso|Kimahri]], who, along with Wakka, are to serve as Yuna's [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#Militant factions|guardians]] after the blitzball tournament, as she journeys on a [[pilgrimage]] to the ruins of Zanarkand. There, she plans to acquire the aid of an entity called "the [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#The history of Spira|Final Aeon]]" to defeat Sin. The party happens upon Auron in the city of [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)|Luca]], and <U+2014> upon learning that Yuna is on a pilgrimage for the Final Aeon <U+2014> he joins the party as her newest guardian. Soon after, they are joined by a young [[Al Bhed]] girl named "[[Rikku]]," who <U+2014> despite being publically branded an outcast for her people's beliefs <U+2014> joins the party, declaring that she also wants to protect Yuna.

As the pilgrimage continues, Tidus learns that the present-day world (called "[[Spira (Final Fantasy X)|Spira]]") centers around [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#The temples of Yevon|the temples of Yevon]], a millennium-old and heavily influential organization. The Yevonite clergy teach that Sin is a divine punishment set upon the people for their pride in the use of machines (known as "machina"). As a result, the temples have forbidden the use of modern technology, and a culture of atonement for past sins is promoted in the hopes of appeasing Sin.<ref name="sinandrepentence">'''Tidus:''' "Yuna, why does Sin always come back?" / '''Yuna:''' "Sin is our punishment for our vanity. And it will not go away until we've atoned." (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> The only other method of defeating Sin deemed acceptable by the temples is the use of the Final Aeon.

Growing increasingly fond of Yuna, Tidus eventually discovers <U+2014> to his horror <U+2014> that if she completes her pilgrimage and uses the Final Aeon against Sin, she will die.<ref name="death">'''Tidus:''' "Why couldn't they trust guardians to protect summoners... The Al Bhed had no right stopping their pilgrimage!" / '''Rikku:''' "The pilgrimages have to stop! If they don't, and they get to Zanaraknd... They might defeat Sin. Yunie could...but then she... Yunie will die, you know? You know, don't you? Summoners journey to get the Final Aeon. Yuna told you, didn't she? With the Final Aeon, she can beat Sin...but then... If she calls it, then the Final Aeon's gonna kill her. "Even if she defeats Sin, it will kill Yunie too, you know?" (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> Aware of her fate, Yuna intends to give her life to provide the people of Spira with "the Calm," the brief period of peace that follows Sin's destruction <U+2014> temporary because Sin always returns.<ref name="calm">'''Tidus:''' "What's the calm?" / '''Lulu:''' "The Calm is a time of peace. It comes after a summoner defeats Sin, and lasts until Sin reappears." (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> Complicating matters further, Auron reveals to Tidus that his father Jecht is alive but no longer human, having now become the unwilling embodiment of Sin.<ref name="sinisjecht">'''Tidus:''' "Is he alive?" / '''Auron:''' "It depends on what you mean by 'alive'. He is no longer human. But then... I felt something of Jecht there in that shell, couldn't you? You must have felt him when you came in contact with Sin." / '''Tidus:''' "It can't be..." / '''Auron:''' "It is. Sin is Jecht." (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> Falling in love with Yuna, Tidus resolves to find a way to free his estranged father and permanently destroy Sin without sacrificing Yuna's life. 

[[Image:Farplane.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of the [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Farplane|Farplane]], one of the locations visited by Yuna and her guardians during her pilgrimage]]
As the party approaches Zanarkand, another disquieting fact is revealed: neither Tidus nor Jecht are ordinary human beings. They and the Zanarkand they hail from are "dreams," or summoned entities, the same as the aeons.<ref name="dream">'''Tidus:''' "Wait...this is a dream." / '''Fayth:''' "Precisely." / '''Tidus:''' "A dream? Are you crazy? I don't have time to be dreaming now!" / '''Fayth:''' "You're wrong. It's not that you're dreaming. You are a dream." (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> Their city, Dream Zanarkand, was created one thousand years earlier, around the time of the original Zanarkand's destruction. At the time, a conflict known as the Machina War led to Yevon, Zanarkand's ruler, taking a desperate measure to preserve his city's memory.<ref name="dreamzanarkand">'''Fayth:''' "Long ago, there was a war.... A war between Zanarkand and Bevelle. Bevelle's machina assured their victory from the start. Spira had never seen such power. The summoners of Zanarkand didn't stand a chance. Zanarkand was doomed to oblivion. That's why we tried to save it &ndash; if only in a memory... The remaining summoners and the townspeople that survived the war... They all became fayth <U+2014> fayth for the summoning." (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> He had his city's surviving people become [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#Fayth and aeons|fayth]], statues that provide a summoner with the means to summon, so that he could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in its image, far removed from the warfare on the Spiran mainland. Thus, Yevon was able to save the memory of his city, even if he could not save the city itself.

Additionally, Sin was created at this time, given form by none other than Yevon himself.<ref name="sin4">{{Cite book | editor=Studio BentStuff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania <U+03A9> | pages=82 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square Enix | id=ISBN 4-88787-021-3}}</ref><ref name="sin5">'''Mika:''' "Spira has lost its only hope. Destruction is inevitable. Yu Yevon's spiral of death will consume us all. I have no desire to watch Spira die...." / '''Rikku:''' "Wait, gramps! Who's Yu Yevon?" / '''Mika:''' "He who crafts the souls of the dead into unholy armor. An armor called Sin." (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> His intention was that the creature would protect him and the fayth while he summoned Dream Zanarkand, and that it would also prevent anyone on the mainland from discovering the summoned city. While the creature performed this duty, Yevon, for his part, would become known as "Yu Yevon" ("the Curse of Yevon") and lose his own humanity, reduced to a disembodied spirit that existed with only the desire to maintain Dream Zanarkand's existence.<ref name="yuyevon">'''Fayth:''' "Tell me, what do you know about Yu Yevon?..." / '''Yuna:''' "Sin is his armor. It protects him." / '''Fayth:''' "Yu Yevon was once a summoner, long ago. He was peerless. Yet now he lives for one purpose: only to summon. He is neither good, nor evil. He is awake, yet he dreams." (''Final Fantasy X'')</ref> Over the next one thousand years, Sin would constantly terrorize Spira's people, leaving destruction and heartache in its wake. 

Tidus and his companions also learn that the Final Aeon is created from the spirit of one to whom a summoner is personally close. When Sin is defeated, Yu Yevon's spirit then possesses the Final Aeon that defeated it, transforming it into a new Sin. It is also revealed that Jecht, believing there was no way to return to Dream Zanarkand, chose to become the fayth for Braska's Final Aeon, and, thus, he became Sin. With the hypocrisy of the Yevon order revealed, Yuna and her guardians defy claims that Sin can never be destroyed, engaging Sin in battle directly, and without the use of a Final Aeon, instead with the aid of the Al Bhed machina. After successfully penetrating their way into the creature's interior, they free Jecht's imprisoned spirit and fight a subsequently weakened Yu Yevon. By finally destroying him, the party succeeds in bringing an end to the cycle of Sin's rebirth, allowing the fayth of Spira to rest after a thousand years. Dream Zanarkand then vanishes, taking <U+2014> much to Yuna's grief <U+2014> Tidus with it.

==Development==
Developed from 1999 to 2001, ''Final Fantasy X'' cost approximately 4 billion [[Japanese yen]] to produce (approximately $32.3 million US)<ref name="cost">{{cite web | author=Andrew Long | year=2001 | title=Financial Fantasy X | url=http://rpgamer.com/news/Q3-2001/071201c.html | work=[http://rpgamer.com/ RPGamer] | accessdate=29 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> with a crew of more than one hundred people. 

As with most other games in the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise, the characters and story of ''Final Fantasy X'' are distinct from those of its predecessors. Executive producer [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]] states that this is to maintain the novelty of each title and to show off his team's true potential. Although he had certain reservations about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting and the transition to real-time story-telling, Sakaguchi believes ''Final Fantasy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team through trying new things.<ref name="interviews" /> For his part, scenario writer [[Kazushige Nojima]] has said that with this installment of the series, he was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between the player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that <U+2014> since both Tidus and the player find themselves in a new world <U+2014> the player's progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own developing understanding and narration.<ref name="interviews" />

''Final Fantasy X'' also features innovations in the rendering of facial expressions on characters, achieved through [[motion capture]] and [[skeletal animation]] technology.<ref name="interviews" /><ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | author=Playboy Staff | title=Final Fantasy X (ps2: 2001): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/finalfantasyx?q=Final%20Fantasy%20X | work=[http://www.metacritic.com/ Metacritic] | accessdate=26 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> This technology also allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, which were then programmed to match the speech of the game's voice actors.

===Voice-overs===
Nojima also revealed that the inclusion of [[voice-over]]s had a substantial impact on the writing of the game's story. He has explained that the presence of voice actors allowed him to maintain a more simple method of storytelling, as the range of emotions that could be expressed through them was greater than that provided by text alone. Nojima has further revealed that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the story and characters themselves, so as to solidify the voice actors' personalities with the characters they were portraying.<ref name="voices">{{cite web | author=GameSpot Staff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X - PlayStation 2 News at GameSpot | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/finalfantasy10/news.html?sid=2829055&mode=all&page=2&q= | work=[http://gamespot.com/ GameSpot] | accessdate=29 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In some respects, however, the inclusion of voice-overs led to additional difficulties. With the game's cutscenes already programmed around the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] voice work, ''Final Fantasy X''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[English language|English]] localization team faced not only the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue, but also the added obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the previously established rhythm and timing of the characters' lip movements. In his words, lead localization specialist [[Alexander O. Smith]] described the process of "fitting natural-sounding English speech into [...] the high-polygon scenes and CG movies" as "something akin to writing four or five movies worth of dialogue entirely in [[haiku]] form [and] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints." To this end, each voice actor was briefed on their character's motivations and feelings for every scene, and also shown various scenes from the game itself.<ref name="battleandvoice" />

Although Tidus is the lead character in the story, he is the only character whose name is never spoken by the game's voice actors. This is because ''Final Fantasy X'' follows the ''Final Fantasy'' tradition of allowing the player to rename the lead character. In this game and ''Final Fantasy X-2'', the other characters refer to Tidus as "him," "he," or "you." However, Wakka speaks Tidus' name in ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', another [[Square Enix]] title, pronouncing it as "tee-dus," as does Tidus' English voice actor ([[James Arnold Taylor]]) during interviews,<ref name="jatinterview">{{cite web | author=Square Enix North America Site Staff | year=2001 | title=Behind The Game Actors <U+2014> Tidus | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/taylor.html | work=[http://www.square-enix.com/na/ Square Enix North America] | accessdate=12 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> while [[Selphie Tilmitt]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' fame pronounces it as "tie-dus" in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''.

===Characters===
[[Image:Yuna3.jpg|thumb|right|Yuna performs the [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#Pyreflies and death|sending]]]]
{{main|List of Final Fantasy X characters}}
The [[playable character]]s in ''Final Fantasy X'' are [[Tidus]], a [[Final Fantasy character classes#Fighter/Knight/Warrior|Fighter]]/[[Final Fantasy character classes#Time Mage|Time Mage]]; [[Yuna]] the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Summoner|Summoner]]/[[Final Fantasy character classes#White Mage|White Mage]]; [[Kimahri Ronso]] the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Dragon Knight|Dragon Knight]]/[[Final Fantasy character classes#Blue Mage|Blue Mage]]; the [[blitzball]] player [[Wakka]]; [[Lulu (Final Fantasy)|Lulu]] the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Black Mage|Black Mage]]; [[Auron]] the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Samurai|Samurai]]; and [[Rikku]] the [[Final Fantasy character classes#Thief/Ninja|Thief]]/[[Final Fantasy character classes#Chemist|Chemist]]. The primary antagonists of the game are [[Seymour Guado]] and the other [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#The temples of Yevon|maesters of the Yevon religion]], while the malevolent creature known as "Sin" serves as the primary source of conflict. In addition, there is a vast supporting cast of named characters, who <U+2014> along with the main characters <U+2014> feature voice talents complementing the principle roles, as well as the myriad incidental characters that have traditionally populated the worlds of ''Final Fantasy''. 

Character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] took particular care in each of the characters' designs. For example, Nomura based Yuna's overall design on Okinawan kimonos. When he learned the character was to perform a dance called "the [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#Pyreflies and death|sending]]," he wanted to give her outfit something that would flow. For this reason, the specific style of kimono he chose for her was a [[furisode]], a kimono bearing long sleeves. Additionally, he adorned her dress and necklace with images of the flower also called "Yuna" (''[[Hau (tree)|Hibiscus tiliaceus]]''), and her name carries the meaning of "night" in [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]], a direct contrast with Tidus' Japanese name, "''T<U+012B>da''," the Okinawan word for "sun." Nomura has explained that while all these subtle details may be unnecessary, he does not want his designs to be without explanation.<ref name="characters">{{cite web | author=Shella | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | work=[http://flaregamer.com FLAREgamer] | accessdate=13 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

For minor characters, sub-character chief designer [[Fumi Nakashima]]'s focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, such that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, the masks and goggles of the [[Al Bhed]] <U+2014> in her words <U+2014> give the group a "strange and eccentric" appearance, while the attire of the [[Races of Final Fantasy#Ronso|Ronso Tribe]] lend to them being able to easily engage in battle.<ref name="interviews" />

===Geography and cultural aspects===
[[Image:Map23cx.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Spira]]
{{main|Spira (Final Fantasy X)}}
The world of ''Final Fantasy X'' is composed of one continent and several islands. Spira is very different from the mainly [[Europe]]an-style worlds found in previous ''Final Fantasy'' games, being much more closely modeled on [[southeast Asia]], most notably with respect to its vegetation, topography, architecture and names. For example, the names of most of the main cast are drawn from either Okinawan or [[Ainu language|Ainu]] words ("Yuna" meaning "night" and "Tidus" meaning "sun" in the former, and "Wakka" "water" in the latter). Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has identified the [[South Pacific]], [[Thailand]] and [[Japan]] as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly in regard to the geographic locations of [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Besaid Island|Besaid]] and [[Spira (Final Fantasy X)#Kilika Island|Kilika]].<ref name="interviews" /> He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past ''Final Fantasy'' games most notably in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. 

Though a southeast Asian theme is dominant, like other games in the franchise, ''Final Fantasy X'' borrows elements of other cultures, such as Arabian and Hindu (their respective mythical figures, [[Ifrit]] and [[Shiva]], are recurring elements in the ''Final Fantasy'' series). Modern philosophy is also represented, with [[Anima (Jung)|Carl Jung's Anima]] (represented by the [[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#Fayth and aeons|aeon Anima]]).

===Musical score===
{{main|Final Fantasy X: Original Soundtrack}}
''Final Fantasy X'' marks the first time [[Nobuo Uematsu]] has had any assistance in composing the score for a ''Final Fantasy'' game. His fellow composers for ''Final Fantasy X'' were [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and [[Junya Nakano]].

The game includes three songs with vocalized elements, one of which is the [[J-pop]] ballad "[[Suteki Da Ne]]." It is sung by Japanese folk singer [[Ritsuki Nakano]] (also known as "Rikki"), whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere.<ref name="interviews" /> "Suteki Da Ne" is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of ''Final Fantasy X''. The song's title translates to "Isn't it Wonderful?" in English, and its lyrics were written by scenario writer Kazushige Nojima,<ref name="interviews" /> while Uematsu composed the instrumentals. Like the ballads from ''Final Fantasy VIII'' and ''IX'', "Suteki Da Ne" has an in-game version together with an orchestrated version used as part of the ending theme. 

The other songs featuring lyrics are the heavy metal opening theme, "Otherworld," sung in English, and the "[[Mythology of Final Fantasy X#Practices|Hymn of the Fayth]]," a recurring piece sung using Japanese syllabary.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Both Japanese and western critics have generally given ''Final Fantasy X'' high scores, with the game attaining a 92/100 "universal score" according to [[Metacritic]].<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | author=Metacritic Staff| title=Final Fantasy X (ps2: 2001): Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps2/finalfantasyx?q=Final%20Fantasy%20X | work=[http://www.metacritic.com/ Metacritic] | accessdate=26 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Leading Japanese video game magazine, ''[[Famitsu]]'', awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score,<ref name="famitsuandtheplaystation">{{cite web | author=IGN Staff | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy X Gets Rated in Japan | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/096/096564p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com IGN] | accessdate=26 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> while readers of the same magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006.<ref name="famitsureaders">{{cite web | author=Colin Campbell | year=2006 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2401&Itemid=2 | work=[http://www.next-gen.biz Next Generation] | accessdate=11 March | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Another leading Japanese gaming magazine, ''The Play Station'', gave the game a score of 29/30 at the time of release.<ref name="famitsuandtheplaystation" /> 

As part of their reviews, ''Famitsu'' and ''The Play Station'' expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game's storyline and graphics, as did the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Video game magazine|magazine]] ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]''. However, the magazine only gave the game a 6/10,<ref name="EDGE">{{cite web | author=Edge Online Site Staff | year=2001 | title=Edge Online: Search Results | url=http://www.edge-online.co.uk/edgedb/search.php?search=&developer=SquareSoft | work=[http://www.edge-online.co.uk/ Edge Online] | accessdate=29 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> describing it as "Sequential software that labels itself next-gen" without providing a next generation gaming experience, instead repeating "the mistakes... made on the last version."<ref name="EDGE2">{{Cite book | year=2002 | editor=Editors of EDGE magazine | title=EDGE February, 2002 | pages=76 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref> In this regard, ''Edge'' cites the game's battle and character-leveling systems, describing the former as only "fractionally more complex" than was the case in previous installments of the series, and the latter as "[no] more flexible than the straight leveling from previous games."<ref name="EDGE3">{{Cite book | year=2002 | editor=Editors of EDGE magazine | title=EDGE February, 2002 | pages=76-77 | language=English | publisher=Future Publishing}}</ref>

''Edge'' also dealt harsh criticism to the game's English script and voice-overs, regarding the dialogue, "both textual and verbal," as "nauseating." The magazine further went on to say that it "...renders the pathos comedic, the comedy dead, and since emotion is meant to be the series' driving force, it butchers the whole game."<ref name="EDGE" />

''Edge'' was not the only critic to find faults with ''Final Fantasy X''. In their 7/10 review, the critics of [[Norway|Norwegian]] gaming site ''Gamer.no'' expressed an unfavorable response toward the game's battle and navigation systems, describing battles as "usually too easy" and exploration as highly linear, together rendering the game "too short for the greatest of RPG enthusiasts."<ref name="gamer.no">{{cite web | author=Bj<U+00F8>rn Terje Erlandsen | year=2002 | title=Final Fantasy X omtale | url=http://gamer.no/omtale/ps2/final_fantasy_x/2637/3 | work=[http://gamer.no/index.html/ Gamer.no] | accessdate=May 3 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> Despite these and other criticisms, ''Final Fantasy X'' was nominated for the 6th Annual [[Interactive Achievement Awards]] for animation and console role-playing game of the year in 2003,<ref name="6thannual">{{cite web | author=Gamecubicle Staff | year=2003 | title=Interactive Achievement Awards | url=http://www.gamecubicle.com/news-nintendo_gamecube_acadamy_arts_sciences_interactive_achievement_awards.htm | work=[http://www.gamecubicle.com/ Gamecubicle] | accessdate=April 26 |accessyear=2006}}</ref> and became a highly popular installment of the ''Final Fantasy'' series worldwide.

===Legacy===
Due to its intense popularity and commercial success,<ref name="connectionandsequel">{{Cite book | year=2001 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy X Ultimania <U+03A9> | pages=191 | language=Japanese | publisher=DigiCube/Square-Enix | id=ISBN 4-88787-021-3}}</ref><ref name="sequel">{{cite web | author=Jeremy Dunham | year=2003 | title=Final Fantasy X-2 Developer Interview | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/442/442025p1.html | work=[http://www.ign.com IGN] | accessdate=30 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Square Enix released a direct sequel to ''Final Fantasy X'' in [[2003 in video gaming|2003]], entitled "''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]''." This sequel <U+2014> the first direct sequel developed in the ''Final Fantasy'' series <U+2014> is set two years after the conclusion of the original story, establishing new conflicts and dilemmas, while also serving to tie up loose ends left by the original game. Also as a result of the game's reception, the producer and scenario writer decided to establish a plot-related connection between ''Final Fantasy X'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', another popular ''Final Fantasy'' title.<ref name="connectionandsequel" />

The advancements in portraying realistic emotions achieved with ''Final Fantasy X'' through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a staple of the series, with its sequel and other subsequent titles <U+2014> such as ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'' and ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'' <U+2014> also featuring this development. Additionally, real-time 3D environments that are traversed in place of an overworld map have also become a standard of the series, utilized in both ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''Final Fantasy XII''.
