By 1883, he already was a second-class ensign and joined the crew of the ironclad ''Blanco'', under the command of future president [[Jorge Montt]]. During the remainder of the [[War of the Pacific]], he served in the ''O'Higgins'', ''Chacabuco'' (blockading [[Pacocha]], in northern [[Peru]]), ''Abtao'' (patrolling the extreme south of Chile), ''Cochrane'' and ''Pilcomayo''.
