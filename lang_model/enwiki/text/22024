'''Marden Airfield''' was an airfield in [[Marden, Kent]], [[United Kingdom]]. It was operation from 1917 to 1935. Initially a [[Royal Flying Corps]] airfield during [[World War One]] it was used post-war as an Emergency Landing Strip, '''RAF Marden''' by the [[Royal Air Force]]. It was also known as '''Pagehurst Emergency Landing Ground'''. Later serving as a civil Emergency Landing Ground, the airfield closed in 1935. The site housed a Royal Air Force transmitter station during the [[Second World War]].

==Location==
Marden Airfield was located east of Marden and west of Staplehurst, and south of the [[South East Main Line|Ashford - Tonbridge railway line]], in [[Ordnance Survey]] grid square [http://www.geograph.org.uk/gridref/TQ7643 TQ7643]. ({{coord|51|10|N|0|31|E|dislplay=inline, title}}), thus north east of [[Marden Thorn]]. Although known as Marden Airfield, most of the site lies within the parish of Staplehurst. The site is {{convert|90|ft|m}} above sea level and was {{convert|900|yd|m}} long by {{convert|350|yd|m}} wide.<ref name=MAH9>''Marden's Aviation History'', p9</ref>

==History==
Marden Airfield was established in January 1917.<ref name=ABCT>{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org.uk/airfields/Marden-Kent.php |title=Marden, Kent |publisher=Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust |accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref> It was a Second Class Landing Ground. Facilities were limited to a [[Bessonneau hangar]] located in the south east corner of the airfield.<ref name=MAH9/> It was used as an Emergency Landing Ground. One example of such use was on 16 March 1917 when a [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|Royal Aircraft Factory BE2c]] of [[No. 50 Squadron RAF|50 Squadron]] [[Royal Flying Corps]] landed at Marden following engine trouble. In 1918, pilots of [[No. 141 Squadron RAF|141 Squadron]], [[Royal Air Force]], who were taking part in ground-to-air [[radio telephony]] exercises were in the habit of making "precautionary" landings at RAF Marden. The pilots did this in order to enjoy the food served at the Station Hotel, Staplehurst. This practice continued until the Commanding Officer of 49 Wing had a genuine problem and landed at Marden. On seeing six Bristol fighters lined up, he made enquiries and discovered the truth. The practice was stopped.<ref name=MAH10>''Marden's Aviation History'' p10</ref>

Marden was still in use by the RAF in 1919, when [[Group Captain]] [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]] landed on 4 July at Marden in [[Airco DH.4]] F5759 following engine trouble. Eaton was returning from [[Paris]] where he had been attending the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Versailles Peace Conference]]. After repairs had been made, Eaton departed for [[RAF Kenley]], but his engine failed near [[Godstone]], [[Surrey]] where the aircraft crash-landed and was written off.<ref name=MAH11>''Marden's Aviation History'' p11</ref>

In civil use, the longest available runway was {{convert|2100|ft|m}} long. The western part of the airfield was separated from the main landing ground by a ditch, which was bridged over a {{convert|100|ft|m}} length to allow access for aircraft. The Bessonneau hangar had been removed by the RAF. A [[windsock]] was located in the north eastern corner of the airfield. The airfield was identified by a circle of [[whitewash]]ed stones {{convert|60|ft|m}} diameter with the word ''MARDEN'' spelled out in the centre. It was lit at night. Telegraph wires at a height of {{convert|25|ft|m}} were an obstacle at the west end of the airfield.<ref name=MAH13>''Marden's Aviation History'' p13</ref> A navigational beacon was installed at Marden. It was powered by [[clockwork]] and had to be wound daily. Lighting at Marden progressed from Chance lights to Gooseneck flares and Money flares over the years.<ref name=MAH12>''Marden's Aviation History'' p12</ref> In the latter years of operation, night landing was possible by giving four hours notice to [[Lympne Airport]] not later than 4pm.<ref name=MAH13/>

Marden remained in use as a civil Emergency Landing Ground. On 27 October 1919, a [[Handley Page Type O|Handley Page O/400]] of [[Handley Page Transport]] landed at Marden due to strong winds preventing it reaching [[Croydon Airport|Croydon]].<ref name=Times281019>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Paris - London Flights In A Gale |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=28 October 1919 |page_number=12 |issue=42242 |column=B}}</ref> On 13 August 1923, [[de Havilland DH.34]] G-EBBW of [[Instone Air Line]] landed at Marden due to a broken oil pipe. The aircraft was repaired and returned to Croydon.<ref name=Flight180823>{{cite journal |title=British Air Travellers Increasing |journal=Flight |Issue=18 August 1923 |page=p474 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1922/1922%20-%200474.html}}</ref> One Wednesday in September 1927, an [[Air Union]] aircraft on a flight from [[Paris - Le Bourget Airport|Paris]] to Croydon landed at Marden due to engine trouble. Another aircraft was sent from Croydon to collect the 11 passengers and take them to their destination.<ref name=MAH11/> Marden was still in operation in 1934, when it was mentioned in [[Kelly's Directory]] for Kent.<ref name=MAH12/> In August 1934, a [[de Havilland Leopard Moth]] on a flight from [[Heston Aerodrome|Heston]] to [[Saint-Inglevert|St Inglevert]], France made a landing at Marden as a child passenger was suffering from [[airsickness]]. The flight was resumed after the child had recovered.<ref name=MAH15>''Marden's Aviation History'' p15</ref> Marden closed on 24 June 1935,<ref name=ABCT/> and the land then reverted to farmland. A RAF wireless station was based on the site during the [[Second World War]].<ref name=MAH14>''Marden's Aviation History'' p14</ref> The last aircraft to land at Marden was on 10 October 1940, during the [[Battle of Britain]], when a [[Hawker Hurricane]] of [[No. 253 Squadron RAF|253 Squadron]] made a forced landing and overturned, the pilot escaping with a cut thumb.<ref name=MAH24>''Marden's Aviation History'' p24</ref>
