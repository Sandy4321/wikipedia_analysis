'''''Ram It Down''''' is the eleventh studio album by [[Judas Priest]], released in 1988 through [[Columbia Records]]; a [[remaster]]ed edition containing two bonus tracks was reissued in 2001. The album earned gold certification (500,000 sales) on July 18, 1988. The band [[Mercenaries of Metal Tour|toured in Europe and North America]] to support the release of the album. This is the last album to feature long time drummer [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]] and the last studio album produced by long-time collaborator [[Tom Allom]] - who returned to produce a 2009 live album.

==Background==
In 1986, Judas Priest intended to release a double album entitled ''Twin Turbos'' of which half would consist of lighter, more commercial [[hard rock]], and the other half would be heavier and less synth-driven. [[Columbia Records]] was resistant to the double album concept, and the project was ultimately split into two separate releases, 1986's platinum selling ''[[Turbo (Judas Priest album)|Turbo]]'', and ''Ram It Down''. At least four songs - the title track, "Hard As Iron", "Love you to Death" and "Monsters of Rock" were written for the "Twin Turbos" project. The title track Ram It Down can be traced even further back as Halford described it as " 'Ram It Down' is a harder song, from the BRITISH STEEL time.".<ref>http://www.thexquorum.com/mad/RAMITDOWN.html#September%2030</ref> It also could have roots as far back as the demo version of "On the Run" from [[Point of Entry]] which had "different lyrics, speed-metal pace, and spit-fire fast vocals" <ref>http://www.thexquorum.com/mad/FAQS.htm#UNRELEASED%20TRACKS:</ref>

[[Drum kit|Drummer]] [[Dave Holland (drummer)|Dave Holland]] experienced health problems during recording, and the band elected to utilize a [[drum machine]] on much of the album rather than bring in another drummer. ''Ram It Down'' would be the final Judas Priest album recorded with long-time drummer Holland, as well as [[Record producer|producer]] [[Tom Allom]]. Allom would later return as co-producer to the 2009 live release ''[[A Touch of Evil: Live]]'' while Holland later received an eight year prison sentence (in 2004) after being found guilty of attempted rape and several indecent assaults.<ref>Former Judas Priest Drummer, Dave Holland, Convicted of Attempted Rape http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=2755</ref>

The band recorded a rendition of ''[[Chuck Berry]]'s'' "[[Johnny B. Goode]]", intended for inclusion on the [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack]] for the 1988 Anthony Michael Hall comedy film ''[[Johnny Be Good]]''; the song found its way onto ''Ram It Down'' and was the album's first single.

Originaly, the song "Thunder Road" was to be put on the album, however after the album producers were asked to do the cover of "Johnny B. Goode", "Thunder Road" was replaced. Some of the parts from the song made it into the cover of "Johnny B. Goode" and also one of the lyric lines was in "I'm a Rocker".<ref>[http://www.thexquorum.com/mad/RAMITDOWN.html#SINGLES: Judas Priest Info Pages - Ram It Down]</ref> The original was placed on 2001 Remaster of [[Point of Entry]].

==Trivia==
*An unknown song was recorded for inclusion on the album but the tape was lost during a chaotic period which resulted from [[Rob Halford|Halford]]'s decision to leave the band and [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]]' hiring as his replacement. For this reason ''Ram It Down'' is the only remastered Judas Priest disc with no added bonus studio tracks, just two added live tracks.

*The song [[Blood Red Skies]] was released as a promo only single with a 4.51 radio edit, the album version and a 10.33 extended remix.<ref>http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/rare-judas-priest-mcd-blood-red-skies-3-versions</ref>

*The band recorded three tracks with pop producers [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock-Aitken-Waterman]] - two originals "Runaround" and "I Will Return" and a cover of the [[Stylistics]] hit [["You Are Everything"]]. However, they were ultimately not included on this album due to a management decision. Pete Waterman calls them "probably the best tracks we ever did" and admits that "I occasionally dig the record out and play it to people, and they<U+2019>re amazed that we made heavy metal.<U+201D>.<ref>http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/faulkner-given-priest-job-in-tiptons-kitchen/</ref> Around this time, [[Glenn Tipton]] also recorded guitar solos for songs by another Stock-Aitken-Waterman produced artist, [[Samantha Fox]], and was officially credited on the track "Spirit of America".
