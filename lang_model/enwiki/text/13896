'''Pontius Pilate's wife''' is [[List of names for the Biblical nameless#Pontius Pilate.27s wife|unnamed]] in the [[New Testament]], where she appears a single time in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Alternate Christian traditions named her ('''Saint''') '''Procula''', '''Proculla''', '''Procla''', '''Prokla''', '''Procle''' or '''Claudia'''. Also combinations like '''Claudia Procles''' or '''Claudia Procula''' are used. No verifiable biography exists on the life of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]<U+2019>s wife. Details of her life are surmised from Christian legend and tradition.

==Biblical references==
In the [[New Testament]], the only reference to Pilate<U+2019>s wife exists in a single sentence by [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] 27:19, she sent a message to her husband asking him not to condemn [[Jesus Christ]] to death: ''<U+2018>While Pilate was sitting in the judgment hall, his wife sent him a message: <U+201C>Have nothing to do with that innocent man, because in a dream last night, I suffered much on account of him.<U+201D>''<ref>See, for instance, [[Wikisource:Bible (World English)/Matthew#Chapter 27]]</ref> Pilate did not heed his wife<U+2019>s warning.

The name "Claudia" only appears once in the New Testament, in 2 [[Timothy]] 4:21: <U+2018>''Eubulus, Pudens, Linus and Claudia send their greetings, and so all the other Christians<U+2019>.'' However, there is nothing to suggest that this Claudia was Pilate's wife.

==Early Christian references and theological interpretations==
[[Origen]]'s second century ''Homilies on Matthew'' suggest that she became a Christian,<ref name="CE-Pilate">''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', entry: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12083c.htm "Pilate"].</ref><ref>Paul L.

Rival theologians contended the dream was sent by [[satan]] in an attempt to thwart the salvation that was going to result from Christ's death.<ref name="Sticca1970" /><ref name="Luz2005" />

Pontius Pilate's wife is mentioned in the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'' (''Gospel of Nicodemus'', probably written around the middle of the 4th century),<ref>''Catholic Encyclopedia'', entry "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01111b.htm Acta Pilati]"</ref> which gives a more elaborate version of the episode of the dream than Matthew.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelnicodemus-roberts.html ''The Acts of Pilate''], translated by M. R. James</ref><ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/gospelnicodemus.html "THE GOSPEL OF NICODEMUS, OR ACTS OF PILATE"], from ''The Apocryphal New Testament'', M.R. James (translation and notes). Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924</ref> The name Procula derives from translated versions of that text. The chronicle of Pseudo-Dexter (1619) is the first place known where she is referred to as Claudia.<ref name="Luz2005" />

==Sainthood==
Procula (Procla, Prokla) is recognized as a saint in two churches within the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian tradition]]: the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]]. In the Greek Orthodox Church, she is celebrated on [[27 October]]. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church celebrates Pilate and Procula together on [[25 June]].<ref name="CE-Pilate" />

==Purported letter by Pilate's wife==
A letter, purportedly written in Latin by Pilate's wife from "a little Gallic mountain town" several years after Pilate left [[Jerusalem]], was first published in English by ''Pictorial Review Magazine'' in April 1929.<ref>[http://issanapress.tripod.com/ Issana Press] - this company published a version of Claudia's purported letter ("A Letter from Pontius Pilate's Wife") in the booklet ''Relics of Repentance'' ISBN 0-9625158-2-5</ref> The English version of the letter was provided by writer Catherine Van Dyke and it states that Pilate's wife successfully sought Jesus' aid to heal the crippled foot of her son Pilo.<ref>''[[Time Magazine]]'', [[1963-04-12]]: [http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,828101,00.html "Gospel According to Claudia"]</ref>

Maier refers to Pilate's wife as "Procula" arguing that the name "Claudia" only comes from a later tradition.<ref>Paul L. Maier. ''Pontius Pilate: A Biographical Novel''.
