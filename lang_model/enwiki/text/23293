"'''My Prerogative'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Bobby Brown]] from his second solo studio album, ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]''. It was released on October 11, 1988 as the second single from the album. After recording sessions for the album were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin travelled to [[New York City]], since he felt something was "missing" from the record. "My Prerogative" was written by Brown as a response to the criticism he received for his departure from [[New Edition]]. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. "My Prerogative" is often considered a [[new jack swing]] anthem, and contains many elements from [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] productions.

The song was positively received by critics and was nominated for a [[30th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] in the category of Best R&B Urban Contemporary Single. It was also commercially successful, reaching number one in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] charts. "My Prerogative" also reached top ten positions in many countries, such as Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The music video for the song features Brown performing the song on stage with his band and dancers. The song was also performed at most of his concerts, usually as the last song of the set list. On the February 4, 1989 performance at [[Madison Square Garden]], he was joined on stage by many popular [[rap music|rap]] artists and producers of the time. 

"My Prerogative" has been covered and sampled by a number of artists from different genres, most notably by [[Britney Spears]]. She released her cover in her first compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'' (2004). The cover was produced by [[Bloodshy & Avant]] and was noted for aptly referring to Spears's relationship with the media at the time. It received mostly unfavorable reviews from critics, with one reviewer calling it "unnecessary". Although the song only appeared in component charts in the United States, Spears's cover surpassed Brown's version worldwide, peaking at the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy and Norway and reaching the top ten in another fourteen countries.<ref name=ultratop/><ref name=ultratopbrit/> The music video portrays Spears arriving at a Hollywood manor in which a party is taking place. In the end, it is revealed that the party is actually Spears's wedding. 

==Background==
Brown had already completed recording sessions for ''Don't Be Cruel'' in [[Los Angeles, California]], but felt something was missing in the record. He said, "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better to [[New York City|New York]] to come up with it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin.<ref name=hour>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lyIiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fXQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3447,2939149|title=Bobby Brown takes his prerogative|date=1989-03-17|accessdate=2010-03-13| last=Italie|first=Hillel|work=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]|publisher=Walter E.

[[MCA Records]] (1988)</ref> During an interview with ''[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]'' on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why was he doing this [a solo career]. It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing".<ref name=hour/> A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.<ref name=remix/>

====Background and composition====
{{Listen|pos=left|filename=Britney spears - my prerogative.ogg|title="My Prerogative"|description=A 20 second sample of "My Prerogative", in which Spears sings over a background of synthesizers.}}
In 2004, [[Britney Spears]] recorded a cover of "My Prerogative" with Swedish production team [[Bloodshy & Avant]], who produced her single "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" from her fourth studio album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003). Bloodshy & Avant recorded the song at Murlyn Studios in [[Stockholm, Sweden]]. Spears recorded the vocals at Teldex Studios in [[Berlin, Germany]].<ref>''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]'' liner notes. [[Jive Records]] (2004)</ref> On August 13, 2004, Spears's label [[Jive Records]] announced through a press release that she had covered the song and was planning to release it on her first greatest hits compilation, titled ''[[Greatest Hits: My Prerogative]]''. The song was set to premiere on radio stations on September 14, 2004,<ref name=press>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1490190/20040813/spears_britney.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Britney Covers Bobby Brown's 'My Prerogative' For Forthcoming LP|date=2004-08-13|accessdate=2010-03-14| last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|publisher=MTV.

MTV Networks}}</ref> Spears's cover of "My Prerogative" is musically different from its original version, with the [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[new jack swing]] sound replaced with [[synthesizers]] and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions.<ref name=press/><ref name=mixtape/> It was noted by Christy Lemire of [[msnbc.com]] that the cover also contains elements of [[Bollywood songs|Bollywood music]].<ref name=msnbc>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6399700/|title=Britney<U+2019>s entirely premature greatest hits|date=2004-11-09|accessdate=2010-03-19| last=Lemire|first=Christy|publisher=[[msnbc.com]]. [[NBC Universal]] / [[Microsoft]]}}</ref> At the beginning of the song, Spears says in a breathy voice the lines "People can take everything away from you / But they can never take away your truth / But the question is, can you handle mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective.<ref name=mixtape/> Jennifer Vineyard of [[MTV]] commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer [[Kevin Federline]].<ref name=press/>

====Reception====
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic]] called the cover "a useless remake, which seems to exist solely for its video".<ref name=allmusic>{{cite news|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r716835|pure_url=yes}}|title=((( Greatest Hits: My Prerogative > Review )))|year=2004|accessdate=2010-03-19| last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation}}</ref> Spence D. of [[IGN]] said that the lyrics fit perfectly with Spears's relationship with the media at the time. He also added, "As for her interpretation, it's an interesting chameleonic diversion that comes off like a [[mashup (music)|mash-up]] between vintage [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-styled production, [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] swagger, and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] sultriness, but never seems to capture the gloss and glory of any of the aforementioned influences".<ref name=ign>{{cite news|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/566/566584p3.html|title=Britney Spears Greatest Hits: My Prerogative|date=2004-11-16|accessdate=2010-03-19| last=D.|first=Spence|publisher=[[IGN]].
