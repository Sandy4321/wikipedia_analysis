'''Dunrobin Castle''' is a stately home in [[Sutherland]], in the [[Highland (council area)|Highland]] area of [[Scotland]], and the family seat of the [[Earl of Sutherland]] and the [[Clan Sutherland]]. It is located {{convert|1|mi}} north of [[Golspie]], and approximately {{convert|5|mi}} south of [[Brora]], overlooking the [[Dornoch Firth]].

Dunrobin's origins lie in the Middle Ages, but most of the present building and the gardens was added by [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] between 1835 and 1850. Some of the original building is visible in the interior courtyard, despite a number of expansions and alterations that made it the largest house in the north of Scotland. After being used as a boarding school for seven years, it is now open to the public.

==History==
The lands of [[Sutherland]] were acquired before 1211, by Hugh, Lord of Duffus, grandson of the Flemish nobleman [[Freskin]].<ref name=LBR/> The [[Earl of Sutherland|Earldom of Sutherland]] was created around 1235 for Hugh's son, [[William de Moravia, 1st Earl of Sutherland|William]], surmised to have descended from the [[House of Moray]] by the female line.<ref name=rcahms>{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/6512/details/dunrobin+castle/ |title=Dunrobin Castle |work=CANMORE |publisher=RCAHMS |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=g131>{{harvnb|Grimble|1987|p=131}}</ref> The castle may have been built on the site of an [[early medieval]] fort, but the oldest surviving portion, with an iron [[yett]], is first mentioned in 1401.<ref name=g131/><ref name=":0" /> The earliest castle was a square [[keep]] with walls over {{convert|6|ft}} thick. Unusually, the ceilings of each floor were formed by stone [[vault (architecture)|vaults]] rather than being timber.<ref name=rcahms/><ref name=hc>{{cite web |url=http://her.highland.gov.uk/hbsmrgatewayhighland/DataFiles/LibraryLinkFiles/28534.pdf |title=Dunrobin Castle Archaeological Sites and Monuments Record |publisher=Highland Council |accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>  The castle is thought to be named after [[Robert de Moravia, 6th Earl of Sutherland|Robert, the 6th Earl of Sutherland]] (d.1427).<ref name="g131" /><ref name=":0">{{harvnb|Montgomery-Massingberd|Sykes|1997|p=57}}</ref>

Dunrobin Castle was built in the midst of a tribal society, with [[Norse language|Norse]] and [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]] in use at the time. [[Robert the Bruce]] planted the [[Clan Gordon|Gordons]], who supported his claim to the crown, at [[Huntly]] in [[Aberdeenshire]], and they were created [[Earl of Huntly#Earl of Huntly (1445)|Earls of Huntly]] in 1445.<ref>{{harvnb|Grimble|1987|pp=131-132}}</ref> The Earldom passed to the Gordon family in the 16th century when the [[John de Moravia, 8th Earl of Sutherland|8th Earl of Sutherland]] gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage to [[Adam Gordon of Auchindoun|Adam Gordon]].<ref name=g132>{{harvnb|Grimble|1987|p=132}}</ref> After the 8th Earl died in 1508, Elizabeth's elder brother was declared heir to the title, but a brieve ([[writ]]) of idiocy brought against him and his younger brother by the Gordons meant that the possession of the estate went to Adam Gordon in 1512.<ref name=g132/>

In 1518, in the absence of Adam Gordon, the castle was captured by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower.<ref name=g133>{{harvnb|Grimble|1987|p=133}}</ref> Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden.<ref name=g133/> During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended with the addition of a large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west.<ref name="rcahms" />

During the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising of 1745]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] under [[Charles Edward Stuart]] stormed Dunrobin Castle without warning, because the Clan Sutherland supported the British government. The [[William Sutherland, 17th Earl of Sutherland|17th Earl of Sutherland]], who had changed his surname from Gordon to Sutherland, narrowly escaped them, exiting through a back door.<ref>{{harvnb|Sutherland|1997|p=29}}</ref> He sailed for [[Aberdeen]] where he joined the [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]]'s army. On the death of the 18th Earl in 1766, the house passed to his daughter, Elizabeth, who married the politician [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|George Leveson-Gower]], later created 1st Duke of Sutherland. In 1785, the house was altered and extended again.<ref name=rcahms/>

Between 1835 and 1850, [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] remodelled the castle in the [[Scottish Baronial architecture|Scottish Baronial style]] for the [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland|2nd Duke of Sutherland]].<ref name=ms61>{{harvnb|Montgomery-Massingberd|Sykes|1997|p=61}}</ref><ref name=h34/> Barry had been the architect for the Palace of Westminster, home to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and was much in demand. The 14th-century tower, and the 17th-century and 18th-century extensions, were retained, and survive within Barry's 19th-century work.<ref name=LBR>{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:7044 |title=Dunrobin Castle |work=Listed Building Report |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>

[[Dunrobin Castle railway station]], on the [[Far North Line]], was opened in 1870, as a private station for the castle.<ref name=rs>{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:7054 |title=Dunrobin Castle Station Waiting Room |work=Listed Building Report |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> The present waiting room was constructed in 1902, and is a category B [[listed building]].<ref name=rs/>

In 1915, the building was in use as a naval hospital when fire damaged much of the interior, but was confined to the newer additions by Barry.<ref name=h34>{{harvnb|Hussey|1931|p=34}}</ref> Scottish architect [[Robert Lorimer|Sir Robert Lorimer]] was engaged to renovate the house following the [[First World War]].<ref name=LBR/> When the [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland|5th Duke]] died in 1963, the Earldom and the house went to his niece, the current [[Elizabeth Sutherland, 24th Countess of Sutherland|Countess of Sutherland]], while the [[Duke of Sutherland|Dukedom]] had to pass to a male heir and went to [[John Egerton, 6th Duke of Sutherland|John Egerton, Earl of Ellesmere]]. Between 1965 and 1972, the house became a boarding school for boys, taking on forty boys and five teachers in its first year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dunrobinschool.co.uk/Scotsman.htm |work=The Scotsman |date=16 December 1965 |title=Dunrobin Castle's lights will blaze once more |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref> Since 1973, the house and grounds have been open to the public, with private accommodation retained for the use of the Sutherland family.<ref name=garden/>

==Architecture==
[[File:Old Dunrobin Castle - geograph.org.uk - 793636.jpg|thumb|right|An older part integrated into newer additions.]]
There are 189 rooms within the castle, making it the largest in the [[Scottish Highlands|northern Highlands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunrobincastle.co.uk/the-castle/ |title=The Castle |publisher=Dunrobin Castle |accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref> Much of Barry's interior was destroyed by the fire of 1915, leading to the restoration by [[Robert Lorimer|Sir Robert Lorimer]], although he incorporated surviving 17th-century and 18th-century work, including wood carvings attributed to [[Grinling Gibbons]].<ref name=LBR/><ref>{{harvnb|Grimble|1987|p=142}}</ref> Externally, the castle has elements inspired by the work of the French architect [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], such as the pyramidal roof over the main entrance.<ref name=LBR/> 

The portion built by Barry uses [[Freestone (masonry)|freestone]] in broadly the same style as the turreted parts from the 16th and 17th centuries, but borrows significant elements from the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau]] style.<ref name=ob433>{{harvnb|Oliver|Boyd|1860|p=433}}</ref> A large quadrangular pile of four stories, with towers at each corner, connects to the older castle by a building of three stories and containing the stately apartments.<ref name=ob433/> The tallest tower, containing the entrance, is {{convert|135|ft}} high, the round towers being {{convert|115|ft}} high and the clock tower {{convert|125|ft}}.<ref name=ob433/>

St. John's Well, in the courtyard of the oldest portion of the castle, is one of the deepest draw [[Water well|wells]] in Scotland, at {{convert|92|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunrobincastle.co.uk/the-castle/sutherland-room.htm |title=The Clan Sutherland Room |publisher=Dunrobin Castle |accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> There is no indication as to the origin of the name.<ref name=hc/>

===Gardens===
[[File:Dunrobin Castle gardens, Sutherland, Scotland-31May2008a.jpg|thumb|right|The gardens as viewed from the castle.]]
The French influence extends into the gardens, completed in 1850, with Barry taking inspiration from the [[Garden <U+00E0> la fran<U+00E7>aise|French formal style]] of the [[Gardens of Versailles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lindsay|Lindsay|1994|p=72}}</ref> Each [[parterre]] is set around a circular pool with a fountain, with the essential layout the same since it was created in around 1848.<ref name=ms61/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardens-scotland.co.uk/dunrobin-garden.html |title=Dunrobin Castle Garden |publisher=gardens-scotland.co.uk |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref> The total landscaped area is {{Convert|1379|acre}}.<ref name="garden" />

===Museum===
A museum displays the [[Trophy hunting|trophy heads]] of animals shot by family members on [[safari]], [[ethnographic]] items from around the world and an important collection of archaeological artifacts.<ref name=mus>{{cite web |url=http://www.dunrobincastle.co.uk/the-castle/museum.htm |title=Museum |publisher=Dunrobin Castle |accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> The museum retains its Victorian-Edwardian arrangement, and is housed in an 18th-century summer-house adjoining the formal gardens.<ref name=mus/> Historically, the castle is a category A [[listed building]], and the gardens are included in the ''Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland''.<ref name=LBR/><ref name=garden>{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2400:15:0::::GARDEN:GDL00160 |title=Dunrobin Castle |work=An Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref>
