'''Cyrenaica''' ({{IPAc-en|s|a<U+026A>|r|<U+0268>|<U+02C8>|n|e<U+026A>|.|<U+0268>|k|<U+0259>}} {{respell|SY|r<U+0259>|NAY|<U+0259>-k<U+0259>}}; {{lang-grc|<U+039A><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03CA><U+03BA><U+03AE>}} ''Kyr<U+0113>na<U+00EF>k<U+1E17>'', after the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]; {{lang-ar|<U+0628><U+0631><U+0642><U+0629>}} ''{{transl|ar|Barqah}}'';) is the eastern coastal region of [[Libya]].
Also known as ''Pentapolis'' in [[Ancient Libya|antiquity]], it was part of the [[Creta et Cyrenaica]] province during the [[Roman Libya|Roman period]], later divided in ''Libia Pentapolis'' and  ''Libia Sicca''. During the Islamic period, the area came to be known as ''Barqa'', after the city of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]].

Cyrenaica was the name of an administrative division of [[Italian Libya]] from 1927 until 1943, then under British military and civil administration from 1943 until 1951, and finally in the [[Kingdom of Libya]] from 1951 until 1963. In a wider sense, which is still used, Cyrenaica is composed of all of the eastern part of Libya, including the [[Kufra District]]. Cyrenaica is adjacent to [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest and [[Fezzan]] in the southwest. The region that used to be Cyrenaica officially until 1963 is now divided up into several [[shabiyah|shabiyat]], the [[districts of Libya|administrative divisions of Libya]].

Cyrenaica was the birthplace of the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan civil war]], and was largely under the control of the [[National Transitional Council]] for most of the war; their headquarters were in [[Benghazi]].<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/18239888?story_id=18239888 "Endgame in Tripoli".] ''[[The Economist]]''. 24 February 2011.

==Geography==
[[File:Libya BMNG.png|thumb|Satellite image of Libya with Cyrenaica on the right side, showing the green Mediterranean coast in the north and the large desert in the centre and south]]
Geologically, Cyrenaica rests on a mass of [[Miocene]] [[limestone]] that tilts up steeply from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and falls inland with a gradual descent to [[sea level]] again.

This mass is divided into two blocks. The [[Jebel Akhdar, Libya|Jebel Akhdar]] extends parallel to the coast from the [[Gulf of Sidra]] to the [[Gulf of Bomba]], and reaches an elevation of 872 meters. There is no continuous coastal plain, the longest strip running from the recess of Gulf of Sidra past [[Benghazi]] to [[Tolmeitha]]. Thereafter, except for deltaic patches at [[Susa, Libya|Susa]] and [[Derna, Libya|Derna]], the shore is all precipitous. A steep escarpment separates the coastal plain from a relatively level plateau, known as the Marj Plain, which lies at about 300 meters elevation. Above the Marj Plain lies a dissected plateau at about 700 meters elevation, which contains the highest peaks in the range.<ref name="Gimingham, C. H. 1954">Gimingham, C. H., and K. Walton (1954). "Environment and the Structure of Scrub Communities on the Limestone Plateaux of Northern Cyrenaica." ''Journal of Ecology,'' Vol. 42, No. 2, Jul., 1954</ref>

The Jebel Akhdar and its adjacent coast are part of the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] [[ecoregion]], and have a [[Mediterranean climate]] of hot, dry summers and relatively mild and rainy winters.<ref>"Mediterranean woodlands and forests". WWF Scientific Report [http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/pa/pa1214_full.html]. Accessed March 27, 2011</ref> The plant communities of this portion of Cyrenaica include forest, woodland, [[maquis shrubland|maquis]], [[garrigue]], [[steppe]], and [[oak savanna]]. Garrigue shrublands occupy the non-agricultural portions coastal plain and coastal escarpments, with ''[[Sarcopoterium spinosum]]'', along with ''[[Asphodelus microcarpus]]'' and ''[[Artemisia herba-alba]]'', as  the predominant species.<ref name="Gimingham, C. H. 1954"/><ref name="El-Darier, S. M 2009 pp 353-360">El-Darier, S. M. and F.M. El-Mogaspi (2009).

''World Journal of Agricultural Sciences'' 5 (3): 353-360, 2009, pp 353-360.</ref> Small areas of maquis are found on north-facing slopes near the sea, becoming more extensive on the lower plateau. ''[[Juniperus phoenicea]], [[Pistacia lentiscus]], [[Quercus coccifera]]'' and ''[[Ceratonia siliqua]]'' are common tree and large shrub species in the maquis.<ref name="Gimingham, C. H. 1954"/><ref name="El-Darier, S. M 2009 pp 353-360"/> The upper plateau includes areas of garrigue, two maquis communities, one dominated by ''Pistacia lentiscus'' and the other a mixed maquis in which the endemic ''[[Arbutus pavarii]]'' is prominent, and forests of ''[[Cupressus sempervirens]], Juniperus phoenicea, [[Olea europaea]], Quercus coccifera, Ceratonia siliqua,'' and ''[[Pinus halepensis]].''<ref name="Gimingham, C. H. 1954"/>

Areas of [[Terra rosa (soil)|red soil]] are found on the Marj Plain, which has borne abundant crops of [[wheat]] and [[barley]] from ancient times to the present day. Plenty of springs issue on the highlands. Wild olive trees are abundant, and large areas of oak savanna provide pasture to the flocks and herds of the local [[Bedouin]]s.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Cyrenaica", from ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition, 1911</ref> Historically large areas of range were covered in forest. The forested area of the Jebel Akhdar has been shrinking in recent decades. A 1996 report to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that the forested area was reduced to 320,000 hectares from 500,000 hectares, mostly cleared to grow crops.<ref name="El-Darier, S. M 2009 pp 353-360"/>   The Green Mountain Conservation and Development Authority estimates that the forested area decreased from 500,000 hectares in 1976 to 180,000 hectares in 2007.<ref>''The Report: Libya 2008,'' p. 134. Oxford Business Group.</ref>

The southward slopes of the Jebel Akhdar occupied by the [[Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe]], a transitional ecoregion lying between the Mediterranean climate regions of North Africa and the hyper-arid [[Sahara Desert]].<ref>"North Saharan steppe and woodlands" WWF Scientific Report [http://www.worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial/pa/pa1321_full.html]. Accessed March 27, 2011.</ref>

The lower Jebel el-Akabah lies to the south and east of the Jebel Akhdar. The two highlands are separated by a depression. This eastern region, known in ancient times as [[Marmarica]], is much drier than the Jebel Akhdar, and here the Sahara extends to the coast. Historically, salt-collecting and sponge fishing were more important than agriculture. [[Bomba, Libya|Bomba]] and [[Tobruk]] have good harbors.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

South of the coastal highlands of Cyrenaica is a large east-west running depression, extending eastward from the Gulf of Sidra into Egypt. This region of the Sahara is known as the [[Libyan Desert]], and includes the [[Great Sand Sea]] and the [[Calanshio Sand Sea]]. The Libyan Desert is home to a few [[oasis|oases]], including [[Awjila]] (ancient Augila) and [[Jaghbub, Libya|Jaghbub]].

==History==

===Berber people===
The oldest known people that inhabited the area in recorded history were the [[Berber people]]. Most of the inhabitants of this [[Libya]]n territory today are considered Berber by origin and their ancestors spoke an ancient [[Berber language]]. Today, remnants of the Berber language of this area are found in [[Awjila language|Awjila-Berber language]] in the [[Awjila]] oasis.

Ancient Berbers founded a number of cities and settlements in the area on the coast and in the internal oases.

===Greek cities===
During the [[Ramesside period]] (thirteenth century BC), the [[Libu]] and the [[Meshwesh]] were tribes of the area of Cyrenaica which are mentioned in Egyptian records as making frequent incursions into the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], and as later controlling the 21st through 24th dynasties.

Cyrenaica was [[Greek colony|colonized]] by the [[Greece|Greeks]] beginning in the [[7th century B.C.]]
The first and most important colony was that of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], established in about 631 BCE by colonists from the Greek island of [[Santorini|Thera]]. They had left their island because of a severe famine.<ref name="Ring">Ring, Trudy ''et al.'' (1996) "Cyrene (Gebel Akhdar, Libya)" ''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Volume 4: Middle East and Africa'' Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Chicago, [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2aOpeBnbxvsC&pg=PA194 p. 194], ISBN 1-884964-03-6</ref> Their commander Aristoteles took the Libyan name Battos.<ref>Details of the founding are contained in Book IV of ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]]</ref> His dynasty, the Battaid, persisted in spite of heavy resistance by the Greeks in neighboring cities.

The east of the province was called Marmarica (no major city), but the important part was in the west, comprising five cities, hence known as the Pentapolis: [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (near the modern village of Shahat) with its port of [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]] (Marsa Susa), Arsinoe or [[Taucheira]] (Tocra), [[Euesperides]] or Berenice (near modern [[Benghazi]]), Balagrae ([[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]]) and [[Barca (ancient city)|Barce]] ([[Marj, Libya|Marj]])&nbsp;<U+2013> of which the chief was the eponymous Cyrene.<ref name="Ring"/>
The term "Pentapolis" continued to be used as a synonym for Cyrenaica. In the south the Pentapolis faded into the [[Sahara]]n tribal areas, including the pharaonic oracle of [[Siwa Oasis|Ammonium]].

The region produced barley, wheat, olive oil, wine, figs, apples, wool, sheep, cattle, and [[silphium]], an herb that grew only in Cyrenaica and was regarded as a medicinal cure and [[aphrodisiac]].<ref name="Ring, Trudy 1996">Ring, Trudy, Robert M. Salkin and Sharon La Boda (1996). "Cyrene (Gebel Akhdar, Libya)" in ''International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 4: Middle East and Africa. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Chicago and London.</ref> Cyrene became one of the greatest intellectual and artistic centers of the Greek world, famous for its medical school, learned academies, and architecture, which included some of the finest examples of the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic style]]. The [[Cyrenaics]], a school of thinkers who expounded a doctrine of moral cheerfulness that defined happiness as the sum of human pleasures, were founded by [[Aristippus]] of Cyrene<ref>"Cyrenaica and the Greeks" from ''The Library of Congress Country Studies: Libya''. 2001. [http://workmall.com/wfb2001/libya/libya_history_cyrenaica_and_the_greeks.html]. Accessed March 27, 2011.</ref> Other notable natives of Cyrene were the poet [[Callimachus]] and the mathematicians [[Theodorus of Cyrene|Theodorus]] and [[Eratosthenes]].<ref name="Ring, Trudy 1996"/>

In 525 BCE, after taking Egypt, the Persians took the Pentapolis.  They were followed by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE, who received tribute from these cities after he took Egypt.<ref name="Ring" />  The Pentapolis was formally annexed by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] and it passed to the [[diadochi|diadoch]] dynasty of the Lagids, better known as the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].  It briefly gained independence under [[Magas of Cyrene]], stepson of Ptolemy I, but was reabsorbed into the Ptolemaic empire after his death. It was separated from the main [[Ptolemaic Egypt|kingdom]] by [[Ptolemy VIII]] and given to his son [[Ptolemy Apion]], who, dying without heirs in 96 BCE, bequeathed it to the [[Roman Republic]].

===Roman province===

[[File:Creta et Cyrene SPQR.png|thumb|''Creta et Cyrenaica'' within the [[Roman Empire]] in the 2nd century]]

The Latin name ''Cyrenaica'' dates to the 1st century BCE. Although some confusion exists as to the exact territory Rome inherited, by 78 BCE it was organized as one administrative province together with [[Crete]]. It became a senatorial province in 20 BC, like its far more prominent western neighbor [[Africa proconsularis]], and unlike [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] itself which became an imperial domain ''sui generis'' (under a special governor styled ''[[praefectus augustalis]]'') in 30 BC.
[[File:Ptolemais Villa of Columns.JPG|thumb|Roman ruins of [[Ptolemais, Cyrenaica]]]]

The [[Tetrarchy]] reforms of [[Diocletian]] in 296 changed the administrative structure. Cyrenaica was split into two provinces: '''Libya Superior''' or '''Libia Pentapolis''' comprised the above-mentioned Pentapolis with Cyrene as capital, and '''Libya Inferior''' or '''Libia sicca''' the [[Marmarica]] (only significant city now the port [[Paraetonium]]), each under a governor of the modest rank of ''[[praeses]]''. Both belonged to the Diocese of the Orient with its capital at Antioch in Syria and from 370 to the [[Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)|Diocese of Egypt]], within the [[praetorian prefecture]] of [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Oriens]]. Its western neighbor [[Tripolitania]], the largest split-off from Africa proconsularis, became part of the [[Diocese of Africa]], subordinate to the [[praetorian prefecture of Italy|prefecture of ''Italia et Africa'']]. After the [[365 Crete earthquake|earthquake of 365]], the capital was moved to [[Ptolemais, Cyrenaica|Ptolemais]]. After the Empire's division, Cyrenaica became part of the East Roman Empire ([[Byzantine Empire]]), bordering Tripolitania. It was briefly part of the [[Vandal Kingdom]] to the west, until its [[Vandalic War|reconquest by Belisarius]] in 533.

====Christianization====
{{See also|Early centers of Christianity#Cyrene|Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)}}
According to [[Synoptic Gospels]], [[Simon of Cyrene]] carried the cross of Jesus Christ to the crucifixion.

According to one tradition, Saint [[Mark the Evangelist]] was born in the Pentapolis, and later returned after preaching with [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] in [[Colosse]] (Col 4:10) and [[Rome]] (Phil 24; 2 Tim 4:11); from Pentapolis he made his way to [[Alexandria]].<ref>[http://www.suscopts.org/coptic-orthodox/church/saint-mark/ "St. Mark the Apostle, the Founder of the Coptic Church"], Coptic Orthodox Diocese of the Southern United States, accessed 19 May 2009</ref>

[[Early Christianity]] spread to Pentapolis from Egypt; [[Synesius of Cyrene]] (370<U+2013>414), bishop of [[Ptolemais, Cyrenaica|Ptolemais]], received his instruction at Alexandria in both [[The Catechetical School of Alexandria|the Catechetical School]] and the [[Museion]], and he entertained a great deal of reverence and  affection for [[Hypatia]], the last pagan [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]], whose classes he had attended. Synesius was raised to the episcopate by [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]], patriarch of Alexandria, in AD 410. Since the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in AD 325, Cyrenaica had been recognized as  an  ecclesiastical province of the [[Patriarchate of Alexandria|See of Alexandria]], in  accordance with the ruling of the Nicaean Fathers.[[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|The patriarch of the Coptic Church]] to this day includes the Pentapolis in his title as an area within his jurisdiction.<ref>[http://www.coptic.net/articles/CoptsAndChristendom.txt "Atiya, Aziz S. "The Copts and Christian Civilization] Coptic.net</ref>

The Eparchy of the Western Pentapolis was part of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] as the [[Pope of Alexandria]] was the Pope of Africa, The most senior position in [[The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church]] after the Pope was the Metropolitan of Western Pentapolis, but since its demise in the days of [[Pope John VI of Alexandria]] as a major Archiepiscopal Metropolis and now being held as a Titular See attached to another Diocese.

After often being destroyed and then restored, during the Roman period it became a mere borough but was, nevertheless, the site of a diocese. Its bishop, [[Zopyrus (Bishop of Barca)|Zopyrus]] (Zephyrius is a mistake), was present at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. The subscriptions at [[Ephesus]] (431) and [[Chalcedon]] (451) give the names of two other bishops, Zenobius and Theodorus.

Although it retained the title "Pentapolis", the ecclesiastic province actually included all of the Cyrenaica, and not just the five cities and Pentapolis remains included in the title of both Popes of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

===Arab and Ottoman rule===
{{main|History of Islamic Tripolitania and Cyrenaica|Ottoman Tripolitania}}
Cyrenaica was conquered by Muslim Arabs during the tenure of the second caliph, [[Omer Bin Khattab]], in 643/44,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/chronologies/Byzantine_Dark_Age.htm |title=Early Medieval and Byzantine Civilization: Constantine to Crusades |publisher=Tulane.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> and became known as '''Barqah''' after its provincial capital, the ancient city of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barce]].  After the breakdown of the [[Ummayad caliphate]], it was essentially annexed to Egypt, although still under the same name, first under the [[Fatimid]] caliphs and later under the [[Ayyubid]] and [[Mamluk]] sultanates. Ultimately, it was annexed by the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517. It was part of the [[Tripolitania Vilayet]]. Its main cities became [[Benghazi]] and [[Derna, Libya|Derna]].

===Italian rule===

[[File:Government of Cyrenaica 1949.jpg|thumb|Emir [[Idris I of Libya|Idris as-Senussi]] (left), and behind him (from left) [[Hussein Maziq]], [[Muhammad Sakizli]], and [[Mustafa Ben Halim]] formed the government of Cyrenaica in late 1940s]]

[[File:Cyrenaica Parliament.jpg|thumb|Littorio Palace in Benghazi was the seat of the Cyrenaican assembly]]
The Italians occupied Cyrenaica during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911 and declared it an Italian [[protectorate]] on 15 October 1912.  Three days later, the [[Ottoman Empire]] officially ceded the province to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. On 17 May 1919, Cyrenaica was established as an Italian [[colony]], and, on 25 October 1920, the Italian government recognized [[Idris I of Libya|Sheikh Sidi Idriss]] as the leader of the [[Senussi]], who was granted the rank of [[Emir]] until in 1929. In that year, Italy "derecognized" him and the Senussi. On 1 January 1934, [[Tripolitania]], Cyrenaica, and [[Fezzan]] were united as the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]].

The Italian fascists constructed the [[Marble Arch (Libya)|Marble Arch]] as a form of an imperial triumphal arch at the border between Cyrenaica and Tripolitani near the coast.

{{anchor|British administration}}
There was heavy fighting in Cyrenaica during [[World War II]] between the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Italian Army]] and the [[Nazi German]] [[Afrika Korps]]. In late 1942, the armed forces of the [[British Empire]] overran Cyrenaica, and the [[United Kingdom]] administered all of [[Libya]] through 1951, when the [[Kingdom of Libya]] was established and granted independence.<ref>Stewart, John (1996) "Cyrenaica" ''The British Empire: an encyclopedia of the Crown's holdings, 1493 through 1995'' McFarland & Co., Jefferson, North Carolina, p. 125, ISBN 0-7864-0177-X</ref>

===Emirate of Cyrenaica===
{{main|Emirate of Cyrenaica}}
In 1949, [[Idris I of Libya|Idris as-Senussi]], with British backing, proclaimed Cyrenaica as an independent emirate called the [[Emirate of Cyrenaica]]. This emirate soon became part of the Kingdom of Libya when it was established and an independent kingdom on 24 December 1951, with Idris as-Senussi becoming King Idris I.

===Gaddafi rule===
{{see also|Modern history of Libya (disambiguation)}}
Since 1 September 1969, when the [[Senussi]] dynasty was overthrown by Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Cyrenaica occasionally experienced nationalist activity against Gaddafi's [[military dictatorship]], including a military rebellion at [[Tobruk]] in 1980.<ref>Associated Press, 'Libyan Opposition to Khadafy Growing but Fragmented Says Expert,' 17 April 1986.</ref>

In 2007, the Green Mountain Conservation and Development Authority, headed by [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], announced a regional plan for Cyrenaica, developed by the firm [[Foster and Partners]]. The plan, known as The Cyrene Declaration, aimed to revive Cyrenaica's agriculture, create a national park, and develop the region as a [[cultural tourism|cultural-]] and [[eco-tourism]] destination. The announced pilot projects included plans for three hotels, including the Cyrene Grand Hotel near the ruins of Cyrene.<ref>Rose, Steve. "Gadafy's green vision".

For much of the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan civil war]], Cyrenaica was largely under the control of the [[National Transitional Council]] while Tripolitania and Fezzan remained under Gaddafi's government control. Some proposed a "two-state solution" to the conflict, with Cyrenaica becoming an independent state,<ref>{{cite news|title=Two-state solution for Libya?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9435000/9435826.stm|publisher=BBC Today programme|accessdate=24 December 2011|date=25 March 2011}}</ref> but this concept was strongly rejected by both sides, and the three regions were united again in October 2011, as rebel forces took Tripolitania and Fezzan and the government collapsed.

===Post-Gaddafi federalism===

Although a historical region, Cyrenaica has not had an official central government of its own for decades. Its individual provinces have reported directly to the central government in Tripoli.

On 20 July 2011, The First National Conference for Federalism proposed the idea for the first time after the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] as a key solution to quickly reach to stability in the country after the fall of the Gaddafi government. Dr. [[Abubakr Mustafa Buera]] was the head of the preparatory committee, and then was elected as the first president for the National Federal Block; the First Political Group that called for federalism.{{cn|date=August 2014}}

On 6 March 2012, a relative of [[King Idris]], [[Ahmed al-Senussi]], was appointed as the leader of the self-declared Cyrenaica Transitional Council, a meeting of tribal and military leaders.<ref>http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/libyan-leader-says-autonomy-call-a-foreign-plot/</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Eastern Libya declares autonomy |newspaper=Russia Today |url=http://rt.com/news/libya-split-cyrenaica-autonomy-971/|accessdate=6 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Eastern Libya declares semiautonomous region |newspaper=The Associated Press |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iklOh4sVKKczlfYNiqahD915lANQ?docId=0b4e6704e5574d8bba64dc44571b9b21 |accessdate=6 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}</ref> According to the Council, Cyrenaica extends from the central coastal city of [[Sirte]] to the Egyptian border.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libya: Semi-autonomy declared by leaders in east |newspaper=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17271431|accessdate=6 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}</ref> In October 2013, "transitional" was dropped and the Council was renamed as "Council of Cyrenaica in Libya" (CCL). According to CCL, there would be further announcements relating to setting up a local parliament and a Shura Council. Struggle for a federal system was also emphasized to take place purely through legal channels.<ref>[http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/10/30/federalist-head-distances-himself-from-jadhran-announces-new-council-of-cyrenaica/#axzz2keSIOmPB Federalist head distances himself from Jadhran, announces new Council of Cyrenaica]. Retrieved 2013-11-19.</ref>

On 2 November 2012, the federal approach was about to evaporate after serious conflicts between the self-declared Cyrenaica Transitional Council lead by [[Ahmed al-Senussi]] and the [[National Transitional Council]], but a new initiative by pro-Cyrenaican motivated youth leaders who resurrected the movement by a successful rally organized by Muheddine Mansury, [[Osama Buera]], and Salem Bujazia the founders of [[Movement for Federal Libya]] which focused on organizing numerous rallies and campaigns in addition to distributing a number of 10,000 flags to rebound the Cyrenaican people to their identity's symbol.

In a competing turn of events, [[Abd-Rabbo al-Barassi]] was appointed as the head of the "Government of Cyrenaica" on 6 November 2013, supported by a local military leader [[Ibrahim Jathran]] and also without the consent of the central government.<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/03/uk-libya-security-idUKBRE9A20ER20131103 East Libya movement launches government, challenges Tripoli].

CCL says that they attempted to present a united front with Jadhran, but that he had proved inflexible and intent on pursuing his own agenda.<ref>[http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/11/03/jadhran-swears-in-his-new-cyrenaican-cabinet/ Jadhran swears in his new Cyrenaican <U+201C>cabinet<U+201D>].
