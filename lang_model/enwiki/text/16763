In [[enzymology]], a '''3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA epimerase''' ({{EC number|5.1.2.3}}) is an [[enzyme]] that [[catalysis|catalyzes]] the [[chemical reaction]]

:(S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA <math>\rightleftharpoons</math> (R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA

Hence, this enzyme has one [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], [[(S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA]], and one [[product (chemistry)|product]], [[(R)-3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA]].

This enzyme belongs to the family of [[isomerase]]s, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on hydroxy acids and derivatives.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is '''3-hydroxybutanoyl-CoA 3-epimerase'''. Other names in common use include '''3-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A epimerase''', and '''3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase'''.  This enzyme participates in [[fatty acid metabolism]] and [[butanoate metabolism]].  

==Structural studies==
