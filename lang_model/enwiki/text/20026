'''Mozilla Firefox''' is a [[web browser]], [[gopher client]] and [[FTP client]] project descended from the [[Mozilla Application Suite]], managed by the [[Mozilla Corporation]]. Firefox had 16.80% of the recorded [[Usage share of web browsers|market share]] in Web browsers as of December 2007,<ref>{{cite web | title =  Top Browser Market Share Trend | publisher = Net Applications | url = http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=3 | accessdate = 2007-11-01 }}</ref> making it the second-most-popular browser in current use worldwide after [[Internet Explorer]].

Firefox uses the [[Open source| open-source]] [[Gecko (layout engine)| Gecko]] [[layout engine]], which implements some current [[Web standard]]s plus a few features which are intended to anticipate likely additions to the standards.

Firefox includes [[tabbed browsing]], a [[spell checker]], [[incremental find]], [[live bookmarking]], a [[download manager]], and a search system that uses [[Google]]. Functions can be added through more than 2,000 [[List of Firefox extensions|add-ons]] created by [[third party developer]]s;<ref>[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1/cat:all addons.mozilla.org Browse all Extensions page]</ref> the most popular include [[FoxyTunes]] (controls music players), [[Adblock Plus]] (ad blocker), [[StumbleUpon]] (website discovery), [[DownThemAll!]] (download functions) and [[Web Developer (Mozilla extension)|Web Developer]] (web tools).<ref>[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1/cat:all/sort:popular?show=50 Most popular Firefox Add Ons]. Retrieved [[2007-10-30]]</ref>

Firefox runs on various versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], and many other [[Unix-like]] operating systems. Its current stable release is version 2.0.0.12, released on [[February 7]], [[2008]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Firefox 2.0.0.12 Release Notes | publisher = Mozilla | url = http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.12/releasenotes/ | accessdate = 2008-02-07 }}</ref> Firefox's [[source code]] is under the terms of the Mozilla [[tri-license]] as [[free and open source software]].<ref name="mozilla_code_licensing">{{cite web | url=http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/ | title=Mozilla Code Licensing | accessdate=2007-09-17 | author=Mozilla Foundation }}</ref>

== History ==
{{Firefox TOC}}
{{main|History of Mozilla Firefox}}

[[Dave Hyatt]] and [[Blake Ross]] began working on the Firefox project as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project. They believed the commercial requirements of [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s sponsorship and developer-driven [[feature creep]] compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/ben/archives/009698.html | title = Where Did Firefox Come From? | accessdate=2007-01-24 | last= Goodger | first= Ben | authorlink= Ben Goodger |date=2006-02-06 | publisher = Inside Firefox}}</ref> To combat what they saw as the [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla Suite]]'s [[software bloat]], they created a stand-alone browser, with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite. On [[April 3]] [[2003]], the [[Mozilla Organization]] announced that they planned to change their focus from the Mozilla Suite to Firefox and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/roadmap-02-Apr-2003.html | title = mozilla development roadmap | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Eich | first = Brendan | authorlink = Brendan Eich | coauthors = [[David Hyatt]] |date=2003-04-02 | publisher = [[Mozilla]]}}</ref>

The Firefox project has undergone several name changes. Originally titled ''Phoenix'', it was renamed because of [[trademark]] issues with [[Phoenix Technologies]]. The replacement name, ''Firebird'', provoked an intense response from the [[Firebird (database server)|Firebird]] free database software project.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&page=ibp_Mozilla0 | title = Mozilla browser becomes Firebird | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | publisher = IBPhoenix.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxworld.com.au/index.php?id=1031068403 | title = Mozilla 'dirty deed' brings out a Firey response | accessdate = 2007-01-30 |date=2003-04-17 | last = Dahdah | first = Howard | publisher = LinuxWorld.com.au | quote = "This must be one of the dirtiest deeds I've seen in open source so far," said Helen Borrie, a Firebird project administrator and documenter.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-1000146.html | title = Mozilla's Firebird gets wings clipped | accessdate = 2007-01-30 |date=2003-05-06 | last = Festa | first = Paul | publisher = [[CNET|CNET.com]]}}</ref> In response, the Mozilla Foundation stated that the browser should always bear the name ''Mozilla Firebird'' to avoid confusion with the database software. Continuing pressure from the database server's development community forced another change; on [[February 9]] [[2004]], Mozilla Firebird became ''Mozilla Firefox'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.com.com/2100-7344-5156101.html | title = Mozilla holds 'fire' in naming fight | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Festa | first = Paul |date=February 9, 2004 | publisher = CNET News.com}}</ref> often referred to as simply ''Firefox'' and Mozilla prefers it be abbreviated as ''Fx'' or ''fx''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/releases/1.5.html#FAQ | title = Firefox 1.5 Release Notes | accessdate = 2008-01-03 | publisher = mozilla.com}}</ref>

The Firefox project went through many versions before 1.0 was released on [[November 9]] [[2004]]. In addition to stability and security fixes, the Mozilla Foundation released its first major update to Firefox version 1.5 on [[November 29]], [[2005]]. On [[October 24]] [[2006]], Mozilla released Firefox 2. This version includes updates to the [[Features of Mozilla Firefox#Tabbed browsing|tabbed browsing]] environment, the extensions manager, the [[GUI]], and the find, search and software update engines; a new session restore feature; inline spell checking; and an anti-[[phishing]] feature which was implemented by [[Google]] as an extension,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing | title = Google Safe Browsing for Firefox | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | publisher = Google.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Phishing_Protection:_Design_Documentation&oldid=46996#Background | title = Phishing Protection Design Documentation - Background | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | author = Mozilla.org wiki contributors | publisher = Mozilla.org wiki}}</ref> and later merged into the program itself.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0/releasenotes/ |title=Mozilla Firefox 2 Release Notes | publisher=Mozilla Corporation |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> In December 2007, [http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Live+Chat Firefox Live Chat] was launched. It allows users to ask volunteers questions through a system powered by [[Jive Software]], with guaranteed hours of operation and the possibility of help after hours.<ref>http://blog.mozilla.com/sumo/2007/12/28/firefox-live-chat-launching-today/</ref>

== Features ==
{{main|Features of Mozilla Firefox}}
Features included with Firefox are [[tabbed browsing]], [[spell checker]], [[incremental find]], [[live bookmarking]], an integrated [[download manager]], and a search system that includes Google. The developers of Firefox aimed to produce a browser that "just surfs the web"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blakeross.com/index.php?p=9 | title = The Firefox religion | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Ross | first = Blake | authorlink = Blake Ross |date=January 22, 2005 | publisher = Blakeross.com (Blake Ross' weblog)}}</ref> and delivers the "best possible browsing experience to the widest possible set of people."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/charter.html | title = Mozilla Firefox Development Charter | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last= Goodger | first= Ben | authorlink= Ben Goodger |date=November 28, 2004 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref>

Users can customize Firefox with extensions and themes. Mozilla maintains an add-on repository at [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/ addons.mozilla.org] with nearly 2000 add-ons in it as of September 2007.<ref>[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:1/cat:all addons.mozilla.org Browse all Extensions page]</ref> <!-- need examples of what can be done with add-ons -->

Firefox provides an environment for web developers in which they can use built-in tools, such as the Error Console or the [[DOM Inspector]], or extensions, such as [[Firebug (Firefox extension)|Firebug]].

Mozilla Firefox supports many [[web standards]], including [[HTML]], [[XML]], [[XHTML]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] 1.1 (partial)<ref>{{cite web | url =http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/SVG_in_Firefox| accessdate=2007-09-30| title=SVG in Firefox}}</ref>, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[ECMAScript]] ([[JavaScript]]), [[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[MathML]], [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XSL Transformations|XSLT]], [[XPath]], and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] images with [[alpha transparency]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Gecko_FAQ | title = Which open standards is the Gecko development project working to support, and to what extent does it support them? | work = Gecko FAQ | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | author = Mozilla Developer Center contributors |date=2007-01-21 | publisher = mozilla developer center}}</ref> Firefox also supports standards proposals created by the [[WHATWG]] such as client-side storage,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#storage | title = WHATWG specification - Web Applications 1.0 - Working Draft.

=== Security ===
Firefox uses a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox security model]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/index.php?title=Bypassing_Security_Restrictions_and_Signing_Code&oldid=44355 | title = Bypassing Security Restrictions and Signing Code | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Ranganathan | first = Arun | coauthors = Netscape Communications |date=November 11, 2002 | publisher = mozilla developer center}}</ref> and limits scripts from accessing data from other web sites based on the [[same origin policy]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/same-origin.html |title=The Same Origin Policy | date = 2001-06-08 | accessdate = 2007-11-12 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref>  It uses [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL/TLS]] to protect communications with web servers using strong [[cryptography]] when using the [[https]] protocol.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/ssl_help.html | title = Privacy & Security Preferences - SSL | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=August 31, 2001 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref> It also provides support for web applications to use [[smart card|smartcards]] for authentication purposes.<ref>[http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript_crypto Developer documentation] on using [[PKCS11|PKCS#11]] modules (primarily smart cards) for cryptographic purposes</ref>

The Mozilla Foundation offers a "bug bounty" to researchers who discover severe security holes in Firefox.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/security/bug-bounty.html | title = Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program | accessdate = 2007-11-21 |date=2004-09-03 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref>  Official guidelines for handling security vulnerabilities discourage early [[full disclosure|disclosure of vulnerabilities]] so as not to give potential attackers an advantage in creating exploits.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/security-bugs-policy.html | title = Handling Mozilla Security Bugs | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=February 11, 2003 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref>

Because Firefox has fewer and less severe publicly known unpatched security vulnerabilities than [[Internet Explorer]] (see ''[[Comparison of web browsers]]''), improved security is often cited as a reason to switch from Internet Explorer to Firefox.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mugsnj.org/MUGShots/Mugshots_04_09a.pdf | title=How to Protect Yourself From Vandals, Viruses If You Use Windows | last=Mossberg | first=Walter S. | publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' |date=2004-09-16 | accessdate=2006-10-17 | quote = I suggest dumping Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, which has a history of security breaches.

A 2006 [[Symantec]] study showed that although Firefox had surpassed other browsers in the number of vendor-confirmed vulnerabilities that year through September, these vulnerabilities were patched far more quickly than those found in other browsers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.techweb.com/wire/security/193005335 | title = Firefox Sports More Bugs, But IE Takes 9 Times Longer To Patch | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Keizer | first = Gregg |date=2006-09-25 | publisher = TechWeb.com}}</ref> Symantec later clarified their statement, saying that Firefox still had fewer security vulnerabilities than Internet Explorer, as counted by security researchers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/03/07/76161_HNsymantecadjusts_1.html | title = Symantec adjusts browser bug count | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = McMillan | first = Robert |date=2006-03-07 | publisher = InfoWorld}}</ref> As of January 07, 2008, Firefox 2 has five security vulnerabilities unpatched, the most severe of which was rated "less critical" by [[Secunia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://secunia.com/product/12434 | title = Vulnerability Report: Mozilla Firefox 2.0.x | accessdate = 2008-01-07 | publisher = Secunia}}</ref> Internet Explorer has seven security vulnerabilities unpatched, the most severe of which was rated "Moderately critical" by Secunia.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://secunia.com/product/12366 | title = Vulnerability Report: Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.x | accessdate = 2008-01-07 | publisher = Secunia}}</ref>

The official end-user builds of Firefox distributed from mozilla.com are licensed under the Mozilla [[EULA]].<ref name="mozeula">{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/eula | title = Mozilla Firefox [[Software license agreement|End-User Software Licensing Agreement]] | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | publisher = mozilla.com}}</ref> Several elements do not fall under the scope of the tri-license and have their use restricted by the EULA, including the trademarked Firefox name and artwork, and the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] closed-source [[Crash reporter#Mozilla|Talkback]] crash reporter. Because of this and the [[clickwrap]] agreement included in the Windows version, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) consider these builds [[proprietary software]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://directory.fsf.org/firefox.html | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | title = Firefox |date=2004-04-01 | last = Casey | first = Janet | publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]] and [[UNESCO]] | work = [[Free Software Directory]]}} Entry updated [[2006-08-16]].</ref> However, BreakPad, an open source crash reporting system, is expected to replace Talkback and is planned for Firefox 3.0.<ref>[http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/03/progress-in-breakpad-firefox-3-crash-report-tool/ Progress in Breakpad, Firefox 3 crash report tool : Mozilla Links]</ref> According to plans, Firefox 3.0 will be the first version of Firefox that is fully open source.

In the past, Firefox was licensed solely under the MPL,<ref name="mozrelicensing">{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/relicensing-faq.html | title = Mozilla Relicensing FAQ | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref> which the FSF criticizes for being weak [[copyleft]]; the license permits, in limited ways, proprietary [[derivative works]]. Additionally, code under the MPL cannot legally be linked with code under the GPL or the LGPL.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html | title = On the Netscape Public License | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Stallman | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Stallman | publisher = [[Free Software Foundation]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#MPL | title = Various Licenses and Comments about Them.

Since the re-licensing, developers have been free to choose the license under which they will receive the code, to suit their intended use: GPL or LGPL linking and derivative works when one of those licenses is chosen, or MPL use (including the possibility of proprietary derivative works) if they choose the MPL.<ref name="mozrelicensing"/>

=== Trademark and logo issues ===
[[Image:Deer Park Globe.png|thumb|The generic globe logo used when Firefox is compiled without the official branding]]
The name "Mozilla Firefox" is a registered [[trademark]]; along with the official Firefox logo, it may only be used under certain terms and conditions. Anyone may redistribute the official binaries in unmodified form and use the Firefox name and branding for such distribution, but restrictions are placed on distributions which modify the underlying source code.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/trademarks/policy.html | title = Mozilla Trademark Policy | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | publisher = mozilla.org }}</ref>

There has been some controversy over the Mozilla foundation's intentions in stopping certain open source distributions from using the "Firefox" trademark. Mozilla CEO Mitchell Baker explained in an interview in 2007 that distributions could freely use the Firefox trademark if they did not modify source-code, and that the Mozilla Foundation's only concern was with users getting a consistent experience when they used "Firefox".<ref>

To allow distributions of the code ''without'' using the official branding, the Firefox [[source code]] contains a "branding switch".  This switch allows the code to be compiled without the official logo and name, for example to produce a derivative work unencumbered by restrictions on the Firefox trademark (this is also often used for betas and alphas of future Firefox versions).  In the unbranded compilation the trademarked logo and name are replaced with a freely distributable generic globe logo and the name of the release series from which the modified version was derived.  The name "Deer Park" is used for derivatives of Firefox 1.5, "Bon Echo" for derivatives of Firefox 2.0, and "Gran Paradiso" is used for derivatives of Firefox 3.0.

Outside of certain exceptions made for "community editions", distributing modified versions of Firefox under the "Firefox" name requires explicit approval from Mozilla for the changes made to the underlying code, and requires the use of ''all'' of the official branding.  For example, it is not permissible to use the name "Firefox" without also using the official logo. When the [[Debian]] project decided to stop using the official Firefox logo in 2006 (because of copyright and trademark restrictions on its use incompatible with the project's [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|guidelines]]), they were told by a representative of the Mozilla Foundation that this was not acceptable, and were asked to either comply with the published trademark guidelines or cease using the "Firefox" name in their distribution.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=354622 | title = Debian Bug report logs - #354622: Uses Mozilla Firefox trademark without permission | accessdate = 2007-01-30 | publisher = Debian.org}}</ref> <!-- is this important enough to include in the context of this article? - Some Debian developers had misunderstood previous communication to be an agreement that allowed them to do this, but Mozilla disputed this assertion. --> Ultimately, Debian switched to branding their modified version of Firefox "[[Naming conflict between Debian and Mozilla#Iceweasel|Iceweasel]]".

[[Image:Mozilla-firefox-usage-data.svg|thumb|Usage share of Mozilla Firefox over time]]

Mozilla Firefox's marketshare has grown for each growth period since inception, mostly at the expense of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer has seen a steady decline of its usage share since Firefox's release. According to Dutch web analytics firm OneStat, by June 2007, Firefox was the second-most widely used browser, with 12.72% of global usage share.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox53-firefox-mozilla-browser-market-share.html | title = Mozilla Firefox usage share remains stable | accessdate = 2007-10-15 |date=July 2, 2007 | publisher = OneStat.com}}</ref> By December 2007, according to data made available by U.S. firm NetApplications, Firefox's market share had grown to 16.80% globally.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=0 | title = Browser Market Share for December, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-07-01 | month = January | year = 2008 | publisher = Net Applications}}</ref>

Downloads have continued at an increasing rate since Firefox 1.0 was released in November 2004, and as of [[September 7]], [[2007]] Firefox has been downloaded over 400 million times. This number does not include downloads using software updates or from third-party websites.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://feeds.spreadfirefox.com/downloads/firefox.xml | title = Spread Firefox: Mozilla Firefox Download Counts | accessdate = 2007-02-14 | publisher = [[Spread Firefox]]}}</ref> They do not represent a user count, as one download may be installed on many machines, one person may download the software multiple times or the software may be obtained from a third-party. According to Mozilla COO John Lilly, Firefox had at least 125 million users as of November 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://john.jubjubs.net/2007/11/27/mozilla-firefox-market-share/ | title = Mozilla & Firefox Market Share | accessdate = 2007-11-27 | date = November 27, 2007 | last = Lilly | first = John }}</ref>

Like other browsers, Firefox has had a number of vulnerabilities that have affected its security, although according to [http://www.cert.org/ CERT], not as many as Internet Explorer.

[[Softpedia]] notes that Firefox takes longer to start up than other browsers,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/Mozilla-Firefox-Review-13677.shtml | title = Mozilla Firefox 1.5 Final Review | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=November 30, 2005 | last = Muradin | first = Alex | publisher = Softpedia | accessdate = 2006-09-22}}</ref> which was confirmed by browser speed tests.<!--<ref name="speedcmp">{{cite web | url = http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/browserSpeed.html HowtoCreate.co.uk | title = Browser Speed Comparisons | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | last = Wilton-Jones | first = Mark | publisher = HowToCreate.co.uk}}</ref> Author has requested that article not be posted/cited as it is outdated!-->
IE 6 also launches slightly faster than Firefox on Microsoft Windows since many of its components are built into Windows and are loaded during system startup.<!--<ref name="speedcmp"/>--> As a workaround for the issue, a preloader application was created that loads components of Firefox on startup, similar to Internet Explorer.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://sourceforge.net/projects/ffpreloader/ |title= Firefox Preloader| accessdate = 2007-04-26 | publisher = ''SourceForge''}}</ref> A feature of [[Windows Vista]] called [[SuperFetch]] does a similar task of preloading Firefox if it is used often enough.

== Future developments ==
{{beta software|section}}

Development of Firefox after version 2.0 is split over two milestones: version 3.0 and version 4.0. Firefox 3.0 is now in the development stage and is expected to be released in early 2008. Development for the 3.0 releases takes place on the Mozilla trunk, with releases coming from the Mozilla 1.8.1 branch (2.0) and the Mozilla 1.9 branch (3.0).

=== Version 3.0 ===
[[Image:Mozilla Firefox 3.0 beta 3.png|thumb|right|Mozilla Firefox 3 beta 3, running on Microsoft Windows XP.]]

The development name for Mozilla Firefox 3 is '''Gran Paradiso'''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning/browse_thread/thread/c73f6a1c25e8e7b0/b714ca46975f0109#b714ca46975f0109 | title = Gecko 1.9/Firefox 3 ("Gran Paradiso") Planning Meeting, Wednesday Jun 7, 11:00 am | accessdate=2006-09-17 |date=June 2, 2006 | last = Vukicevic | first = Vladimir | publisher = Google Groups: mozilla.dev.planning}}</ref> The precursory releases are codenamed "Minefield", as this is the name of the [[Trunk (software)|trunk]] builds. "[[Gran Paradiso]]", like other Firefox development names, is an actual place; in this case the highest mountain group in the [[Graian Alps]]. 

The development team has asked users to submit feature requests that they wish to be included in Firefox 3.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061013-7986.html | title=Firefox accepting feature suggestions for version 3 | date=[[2006-10-13]] | accessdate=2007-02-05 | last = Reimer | first = Jeremy | publisher = Arstechnica.com}}</ref>

On [[November 19]][[2007]], Firefox 3 Beta 1 was released.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/ | author = Mike Beltzner | publisher = Mozilla Developer News | title = Firefox 3 Beta 1 now available for download}}</ref>  The second beta (Firefox 3 Beta 2) was released on [[December 18]][[2007]].<ref>{{cite web | accessdate = 2007-12-20 | url=http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/12/18/firefox-3-beta-2-now-available-for-download/ | author = Mike Beltzner | publisher = Mozilla Developer News | title = Firefox 3 Beta 2 now available for download}}</ref> With at least four total beta releases planned,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2008/01/29/firefox-3-beta-3-code-freeze-tonight/ | title=Firefox 3 beta 3 code freeze tonight}}</ref> it is estimated that Firefox 3 will be released in early 2008.

==== Backend changes ====
One of the big changes in Firefox 3 is the implementation of [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] 1.9, an updated [[layout engine]]. The new version fixes many bugs and implements new web APIs.<ref name="mdc_fx3_developers">{{cite web | url = http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers | title = Firefox 3 for developers | accessdate = 2007-07-17 |date=2007-07-17 | publisher = Mozilla Developer Center}}</ref> In particular, it will make Firefox 3 the first official release of a Mozilla browser to pass the [[Acid2]] test, a standards-compliance test for web-page rendering. 

Many of the new features are defined in the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group|WHATWG]] [[HTML 5]] specification.<ref name="mdc_fx3_developers"/> In particular, support for the controversial<ref>{{cite web | url = http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/darin/archives/009594.html | title = <nowiki><a ping></nowiki> | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=2006-01-17 | last = Fisher | first = Darin | publisher = Fried Fish}} Comments section.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=319368 | title = Bug 319368 - Implement <a ping> | accessdate = 2007-01-24 | publisher = Bugzilla@Mozilla}}</ref> "ping"<ref name="whatwgping">{{cite web | url = http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#ping | title = WHATWG specification - Web Applications 1.0 - Working Draft. Hyperlink attributes: the <code>ping</code> attribute. | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=January 23, 2007 | publisher = WHATWG.org}}</ref> attribute for [[HTML element#Links_and_anchors|HTML links]] had been implemented and was set to be enabled by default before the HTML5 "ping" specification changed, making the Firefox implementation incompatible.<ref>https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415168</ref><ref name="sendpings">{{cite web | url = http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=Browser.send_pings&oldid=26117 | title = browser.send_pings | accessdate = 2007-02-05 |date=2006-06-03 | author = MozillaZine Knowledge Base contributors | publisher = MozillaZine Knowledge Base}}</ref> The purpose of this attribute is to allow tracking link click-throughs without the disadvantages of traditional methods such as [[URL redirection|redirects]] and JavaScript, which can be cumbersome to implement and often slow the user from reaching their intended destination.<ref name="whatwgping"/><ref name="sendpings"/> Another advantage over current techniques is that the user has the option of turning the "ping" feature off. LWN notes that "[t]he redirect technique is arguably worse than the ping attribute".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://lwn.net/Articles/168186 | title = Firefox and the ping attribute | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=January 18, 2006 | publisher = [[LWN.net]]}}</ref>

Other new features include support for [[offline]] web applications, cross-site [[XMLHttpRequest]], and [[Animated PNG|APNG]] support.<ref name="mdc_fx3_developers"/>

Gecko 1.9 uses [[Cairo (graphics)|cairo]] as a graphics backend,<ref>{{cite web | title=Mozilla Cairo Vector Graphics | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219212346/http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6498 | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=April 24, 2005 | publisher=mozillaZine}} A page describing the future usage of cairo.</ref> allowing for improved graphics performance and better consistency of look and feel on various operating systems. Because of cairo's lack of support for [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]], [[Windows Me]] and [[Windows NT]] (versions [[Windows NT 4.0|4.0]] and below), and because [[Microsoft]] ended support for Windows 98 and Windows Me on [[July 11]] [[2006]], Firefox 3 will not run on those operating systems. Similarly, the Mac version of Firefox 3 will only run on [[Mac OS X]] 10.4 or higher,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/granparadiso/system-requirements.html | title=Gran Paradiso - System Requirements | accessdate=2007-09-11 | publisher = mozilla.org}}</ref> but, unlike previous versions, will have a native [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] [[Widget (computing)|widget]] interface.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://reviews.zdnet.co.uk/software/productivity/0,1000001108,39285100,00.htm | title=Firefox 3 (Gran Paradiso) Alpha 1 | accessdate=2007-02-05 |date=2006-12-12 | author = [[CNET]] staff | publisher = [[ZDNet]].co.uk}}</ref>

==== Frontend changes ====

Work is currently in progress to make new default themes for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, giving Firefox a more native look and feel on different operating systems.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Mozilla working on Firefox 3 visual refresh for Linux | url = http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/10/16/mozilla-working-on-firefox-3-visual-refresh-for-linux }}</ref> As of Firefox 3 Beta 2, the GNOME/GTK version inherits the native GNOME icon theme. Similarly, the KDE version{{huh|date=February 2008}} gets icons from the environment. As such when the desktop environment icon theme changes, Firefox follows suit. Additionally, the GTK version has reverted the non-native tab bar that was implemented in Firefox 2.0 and instead uses the native GTK+ tab style.

As far as [[front-end and back-end|frontend]] changes go, Firefox will feature a redesigned download manager with built-in search and the ability to resume downloads.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0b1/releasenotes/ | title=Firefox 3 Beta 1 Release Notes date=2007-11-19 | accessdate=2007-12-05 | publisher=mozilla.com }}</ref>  Also, a new plug-in manager is included in the add-ons menu.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/08/first-look-to-firefox-3s-new-download-manager | title=First look to Firefox 3<U+2019>s new download manager | date=[[2007-08-11]] | accessdate=2007-08-12 | last = Cabello | first = Percy | publisher = mozillalinks.org}}</ref> [[Microformat]]s are supported for use by software that can understand their use in documents to store data in a  machine-readable form.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microformats | title=Microformats (Mozilla Wiki) | | date=[[2007-05-24]] | accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref>

[[Image:Firefox 3 Location Bar.png|thumb|left|New location bar auto-complete feature in Firefox 3 Beta 2.]]

The password manager in Firefox 3 will now ask the user if they would like it to remember the password after the [[log on]] attempt rather than before.  By doing this users are able to avoid storing an incorrect password in the password manager after a bad log on attempt.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/09/firefoxs-password-manager-gets-smarter/ | title=Firefox<U+2019>s password manager gets smarter | date=[[2007-09-01]] | accessdate=2007-09-07 | last = Cabello | first = Percy | publisher = mozillalinks.org}}</ref>

Firefox 3 will use the new Places system for storing bookmarks and history in an [[SQLite]] backend.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Places&oldid=46000 | title=Places | date=[[2006-10-16]] | accessdate=2007-02-05 | author = Mozilla Wiki contributors | publisher = Mozilla Wiki}}</ref> The new system stores more information about user's history and bookmarks, in particular letting the user [[Tag (metadata)|tag]] the pages. It is also used to implement an improved algorithm for the new location bar auto-complete feature.<ref>[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/3.0a8/releasenotes/ 3.0a8 release notes]</ref><ref>http://wiki.mozilla.org/Places:Fx3UIPlan</ref>

The Mac version of Firefox 3 will support [[Growl (software)|Growl]] notifications, and [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-style form controls.

The default icons and icon layout for Firefox 3 will also change dramatically, and Firefox 3 will take on a keyhole shape for the forward and back buttons.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2008/01/22/navigation-toolbar-on-windows/ | title=Keyhole Shape | date=[[2007-01-23]] | accessdate=2007-01-23 | author = Alex Faaborg | publisher = Alex Faaborg}}</ref> The Iconfactory are redesigning the icons for the different supported platforms (Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux). In addition, separate icons sets were planned for Windows XP and Vista.

=====Themes=====
Firefox 3 will contain a specially designed default theme for each specific operating system.

=== Version 4.0 ===

On [[October 13]] [[2006]], [[Brendan Eich]], Mozilla's [[Chief Technology Officer]], wrote about the plans for Mozilla 2, the platform on which Firefox 4.0 is likely to be based. These changes include improving and removing [[XPCOM]] [[Application programming interface|API]]s, switching to standard [[C++]] features, [[just-in-time compilation]] with [[JavaScript]] 2 (known as the [[Tamarin (JIT)|Tamarin]] project), tool-time and runtime security checks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/10/mozilla_2.html | title=Mozilla 2 | last=Eich | first=Brendan | date=[[2006-10-13]] | accessdate=2006-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/11/project_tamarin.html | title=Project Tamarin | last=Eich | first=Brendan | date=[[2006-11-07]] | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> It has also been announced that support for the gopher protocol will be removed by default for Firefox version 4. It is likely to be supported as an addon if an owner steps up to do the work.

=== Future features ===

Open-source, in-browser video playback is intended to be included in Firefox, according to [[Mitchell Baker]], Mozilla's former [[Chief Executive Officer]]. The goal is to do video playback without being encumbered by patent issues that are associated with so many video technologies.<ref name="Warne APC">

Baker also discussed the Mozilla Foundation's project to create a version of Firefox that will run reliably on mobile phones, as well as a strategy for syncing content downloaded on a PC with mobile handsets.<ref name="Warne APC"/>

Meanwhile, offline application support technology -- similar to [[Google Gears]] is also being built as part of Firefox. Mozilla CEO Mitchell Baker said in an interview that given so much investment has now been made in the web as a platform, in order to take it to the next step, applications must continue to work when a computer's internet connection is offline.<ref name="Warne APC"/>
