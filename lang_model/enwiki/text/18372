'''Urquhart Castle''' ({{Audio|Urquhart.ogg|listen}}; {{lang-gd|Caisteal na Sr<U+00F2>ine}}) sits beside [[Loch Ness]] in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] of [[Scotland]]. The castle is on the [[A82 road]], {{convert|21|km}} south-west of [[Inverness]] and {{convert|2|km}} east of the village of [[Drumnadrochit]]. 

The present ruins date from the 13th to the 16th centuries, though built on the site of an early medieval fortification. Founded in the 13th century, Urquhart played a role in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] in the 14th century. It was subsequently held as a royal castle, and was raided on several occasions by the MacDonald [[Earl of Ross|Earls of Ross]]. The castle was granted to the [[Clan Grant]] in 1509, though conflict with the MacDonalds continued.  Despite a series of further raids the castle was strengthened, only to be largely abandoned by the middle of the 17th century. Urquhart was partially destroyed in 1692 to prevent its use by [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] forces, and subsequently decayed. In the 20th century it was placed in state care and opened to the public: it is now one of the most-visited castles in Scotland.<ref name=ALVA/>

The castle, situated on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, is one of the largest in Scotland in area.<ref name=Tab25/> It was approached from the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle were laid out around two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-storey Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises the scant remains of earlier buildings.

==History==

===Early Middle Ages===
The name Urquhart derives from the 7th-century form ''Airdchartdan'', itself a mix of [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]] ''air'' (by) and [[Old Welsh]] ''cardden'' (thicket or wood).<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.16</ref> Pieces of [[vitrified fort|vitrified]] stone, subjected to intense heat and characteristic of early medieval fortification, had been discovered at Urquhart from the early 20th century.<ref name=AA242>Alcock & Alcock (1992), p.242</ref> Speculation that Urquhart may have been the fortress of [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei son of Maelchon]], king of the northern [[Picts]], led Professor [[Leslie Alcock]] to undertake excavations in 1983. [[Adomn<U+00E1>n]]'s ''Life of Columba'' records that [[Columba|St. Columba]] visited Bridei some time between 562 and 586, though little geographical detail is given.<ref name=AA242/> Adomn<U+00E1>n also relates that during the visit, Columba [[Christianization|converted]] a Pictish nobleman named Emchath, who was on his deathbed, his son Virolec, and their household, at a place called ''Airdchartdan''.<ref>Anderson & Anderson (1991), pp.202<U+2013>203</ref>  The excavations, supported by [[radiocarbon dating]],<ref>Alcock & Alcock (1992), pp.251<U+2013>252</ref> indicated that the rocky knoll at the south-west corner of the castle had been the site of an extensive fort between the 5th and 11th centuries.<ref>Alcock & Alcock (1992), p.257</ref> The findings led Professor Alcock to conclude that Urquhart is most likely to have been the site of Emchath's residence, rather than that of Bridei who is more likely to have been based at Inverness, either at the site of the [[Inverness Castle|castle]] or at [[Craig Phadrig]] to the west.<ref>Alcock & Alcock (1992), p.265</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://her.highland.gov.uk/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MHG3809 | title=Fort, Craig Phadrig | publisher=Highland Council | work=Highland Heritage Environment Record | accessdate=21 December 2012}}</ref>

===The early castle===
Some sources state that [[William the Lion]] had a royal castle at Urquhart in the 12th century,<ref name=lbr/><ref name=mr90/> though Professor Alcock finds no evidence for this.<ref name=Alcock245/> In the 12th and 13th centuries, the [[Meic Uilleim]] (MacWilliams), descendents of [[Malcolm III]], staged a series of rebellions against [[David I of Scotland|David I]] and his successors. The last of these rebellions was put down in 1229, and to maintain order [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] granted Urquhart to his ''[[Hostarius]]'' (usher or door-ward), [[Thomas de Lundin]]. On de Lundin's death a few years later it passed to his son [[Alan Durward]].<ref name=tab30/> It is considered likely that the original castle was built soon after this time, centred on the motte at the south-west of the site.<ref name=Alcock245/> In 1275, after Alan's death, the king granted Urquhart to [[John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch]].<ref name=tab30>Tabraham (2002), p.30</ref>

The first documentary record of Urquhart Castle occurs in 1296, when it was captured by [[Edward I of England]].<ref name=Alcock245>Alcock & Alcock (1992), p.245</ref> Edward's invasion marked the beginning of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], which would go on intermittently until 1357. Edward appointed [[William FitzWarin|Sir William fitz Warin]] as constable to hold the castle for the English. In 1297 he was ambushed by [[Andrew Moray|Sir Andrew de Moray]] while returning from Inverness, and Moray subsequently laid siege to the castle, launching an unsuccessful night attack.<ref>Bain (1884), p.239</ref> The English must have been dislodged soon after, since in 1298 Urquhart was again controlled by the Scots. In 1303 Sir Alexander de Forbes failed to hold off another English assault.<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.31</ref> This time Edward installed as governor Alexander Comyn, brother of John, as the family had sided with the English against [[Robert Bruce]]. Following his murder of the [[Red Comyn]] in 1306, Bruce completed his defeat of the Comyns when he marched through the Great Glen in 1307, taking the castles of [[Inverlochy Castle|Inverlochy]], Urquhart and Inverness.<ref>Scott (1982), p.107</ref> After this time Urquhart became a royal castle, held for the crown by a series of constables.<ref name=tab32>Tabraham (2002), p.32</ref>

[[File:Urquhart Castle from Visitor Centre - geograph.org.uk - 1290717.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of the 13th-century "shell keep" or motte is the earliest part of the castle to survive]]

[[Sir Robert Lauder of Quarrelwood]] was constable of Urquhart Castle in 1329. After fighting at the [[Battle of Halidon Hill]] in 1333, where the Scots were defeated, Lauder returned to hold Urquhart against another threatened English invasion. It is recorded as being one of only five castles in Scotland held by the Scots at this time.<ref group="nb">The others were [[Dumbarton Castle|Dumbarton]], [[Loch Leven Castle|Lochleven]], [[Kildrummy Castle|Kildrummy]] and [[Loch Doon Castle|Loch Doon]]. Tabraham (2002), p.32.</ref> In 1342, [[David II of Scotland|David II]] spent the summer hunting at Urquhart, the only king to have stayed here.<ref name=tab32/> 

Over the next two hundred years, the Great Glen was raided frequently by the [[Clan Donald|MacDonald]] [[Lords of the Isles]], powerful rulers of a semi-independent kingdom in western Scotland, with a claim to the [[Earl of Ross|earldom of Ross]]. In 1395, [[Domhnall of Islay, Lord of the Isles|Domhnall of Islay]] seized Urquhart Castle from the crown, and managed to retain it for over 15 years. In 1411, he marched through the glen to take on the king's supporters at the [[Battle of Harlaw]]. Although an indecisive battle, Domhnall subsequently lost the initiative and the crown was soon back in control of Urquhart.<ref name=tab35>Tabraham (2002), pp.34<U+2013>35</ref> In 1437 Domhnall's son [[Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross|Alexander]], now Earl of Ross, raided around Glen Urquhart but could not take the castle. Royal funds were granted to shore up the castle's defences. Alexander's son [[John of Islay, Earl of Ross|John]] succeeded his father in 1449, aged 16. In 1452 he too led a raid up the Great Glen, seizing Urquhart, and subsequently obtained a grant of the lands and castle of Urquhart for life. However, in 1462 John made [[Treaty of Westminster (1462)|an agreement]] with [[Edward IV of England]] against the Scottish King [[James III of Scotland|James III]]. When this became known to James in 1476, John was stripped of his titles, and Urquhart was turned over to an ally, the [[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly|Earl of Huntly]].<ref name=tab35/>

===The Grants===
[[File:Urquhart Castle from Loch Ness Scotland.jpg|thumb|The Grant Tower viewed from Loch Ness]]

Huntly brought in Sir Duncan Grant of [[Castle Grant|Freuchie]] to restore order to the area around Urquhart Castle. His son John Grant of Freuchie (d.1538) was given a five-year lease of the [[Glen Urquhart]] estate in 1502. In 1509, Urquhart Castle, along with the estates of Glen Urquhart and [[Glenmoriston]],<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.36</ref> was granted by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] to John Grant in perpetuity, on condition that he repair and rebuild the castle.<ref>MacGibbon & Ross (1889), p.92</ref>  The [[Clan Grant|Grants]] maintained their ownership of the castle until 1912, although the raids from the west continued. In 1513, following the disaster of [[Battle of Flodden|Flodden]], [[Clan MacDonald of Lochalsh|Sir Donald MacDonald of Lochalsh]] attempted to gain from the disarray in Scotland by claiming the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] and occupying Urquhart Castle. Grant regained the castle before 1517, but not before the MacDonalds had driven off 300 cattle and 1,000 sheep, as well as looting the castle of provisions.<ref name=tab37>Tabraham (2002), p.37</ref> Grant unsuccessfully attempted to claim damages from MacDonald.<ref name=munro>Munro & Munro (2004)</ref> James Grant of Freuchie (d.1553) succeeded his father, and in 1544 became involved with [[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly|Huntly]] and [[Clan Fraser]] in a feud with the [[Clan Macdonald of Clanranald|Macdonalds of Clanranald]], which culminated in the [[Battle of the Shirts]]. In retaliation, the MacDonalds and their allies the [[Clan Cameron|Camerons]] attacked and captured Urquhart in 1545.<ref name=munro/> Known as the "Great Raid", this time the MacDonalds succeeded in taking 2,000 cattle, as well as hundreds of other animals, and stripped the castle of its furniture, cannon, and even the gates.<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.39</ref><ref name=MR93/> Grant regained the castle, and was also awarded Cameron lands as recompense.<ref name=munro/> 

The Great Raid proved to be the last raid. In 1527, the historian [[Hector Boece]] wrote of the "rewinous wallis" of Urquhart,<ref name=tab37/> but by the close of the 16th century Urquhart had been rebuilt by the Grants, now a powerful force in the Highlands. Repairs and remodelling continued as late as 1623, although the castle was no longer a favoured residence. In 1644 a mob of [[Covenanter]]s (Presbyterian agitators) broke into the castle when Lady Mary Grant was staying, robbing her and turning her out for her adherence to [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalianism]]. An inventory taken in 1647 shows the castle virtually empty.<ref name=tab40>Tabraham (2002), p.40</ref> When [[Oliver Cromwell]] invaded Scotland in 1650, he disregarded Urquhart in favour of building forts at either end of the Great Glen.<ref name=tab40/> 

[[File:Urquhart Castle entrance.jpg|thumb|left|Broken masonry from the destruction of the gatehouse]]
When [[James VII]] was deposed in the [[Glorious Revolution|Revolution of 1688]], Ludovic Grant of Freuchie sided with [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and garrisoned the castle with 200 of his own soldiers. Though lacking weapons they were  well-provisioned and, when a force of 500 [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] (supporters of the exiled James) laid siege, the garrison were able to hold out until after the defeat of the main Jacobite force at [[Battle of Cromdale|Cromdale]] in May 1690. When the soldiers finally left they blew up the gatehouse to prevent reoccupation of the castle by the Jacobites. Large blocks of collapsed masonry are still visible beside the remains of the gatehouse.<ref name=tab40/> Parliament ordered <U+00A3>2,000 compensation to be paid to Grant, but no repairs were undertaken.<ref name=gifford217/> Subsequent plundering of the stonework and other materials for re-use by locals further reduced the ruins, and the Grant Tower partially collapsed following a storm in 1715.<ref name=hsabout>{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_297&PropName=Urquhart%20Castle |title=Urquhart Castle: About the Property |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref>

===Later history===
By the 1770s the castle was roofless, and was regarded as a romantic ruin by 19th-century painters and visitors to the Highlands.<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.42</ref> In 1884 the castle came under the control of Caroline, Dowager Countess of Seafield, widow of the [[John Ogilvy-Grant, 7th Earl of Seafield|7th Earl of Seafield]], on the death of her son the [[Ian Ogilvy-Grant, 8th Earl of Seafield|8th Earl]]. On Lady Seafield's death in 1911 her will instructed that Urquhart Castle be entrusted into state care, and in October 1913 responsibility for the castle's upkeep was transferred to the Commissioners of [[Office of Works|His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings]].<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.44</ref> [[Historic Scotland]], the successor to the Office of Works, continues to maintain the castle, which is a [[listed building#Scotland|category A listed building]] and a [[scheduled monument]] in recognition of its national significance.<ref name=lbr>{{cite web | url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:1119811700831055::::BUILDING:15026 | title=Urquhart Castle: Listed Building Report | publisher=Historic Scotland | accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2300:35:1297912492784868::NO::P35_SELECTED_MONUMENT:90309 |title=Urquhart Castle |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>

Urquhart Castle is sited on Strone Point, a triangular promontory on the north-western shore of Loch Ness, and commands the route along this side of the [[Great Glen]] as well as the entrance to [[Glen Urquhart]].<ref name=Gifford216>Gifford (1992), p.216</ref>  The castle is quite close to water level, though there are low cliffs along the north-east sides of the promontory. There is considerable room for muster on the inland side, where a "castle-toun" of service buildings would originally have stood, as well as gardens and orchards in the 17th century.<ref name=Tab25>Tabraham (2002), p.25</ref> Beyond this area the ground rises steeply to the north-west, up to the visitor centre and the A82. A dry moat, {{convert|30|m}} across at its widest, defends the landward approach, possibly excavated in the early Middle Ages. A stone-built causeway provides access, with a [[drawbridge]] formerly crossing the gap at the centre.<ref name=Gifford216/> The castle side of the causeway was formerly walled-in, forming an enclosed space similar to a [[barbican]].<ref name=tab4>Tabraham (2002), p.4</ref>

Urquhart is one of the largest castles in Scotland in area.<ref name=Tab25/> The walled portion of the castle is shaped roughly like a figure-8 aligned northeast-southwest along the bank of the loch, around {{convert|150|by|46|m}},<ref name=mr90>MacGibbon & Ross (1889), p.90</ref> forming two [[bailey (fortification)|baileys]] (enclosures): the Nether Bailey to the north, and the Upper Bailey to the south.<ref group="nb">The two enclosures are variously named: MacGibbon & Ross (1889, p.93) identify the northern enclosure as the "inner" and the southern as the "outer". Gifford (1992, p.217) names them as "upper bailey" (south) and "nether bailey" (north), but notes a shift in importance from the upper to the nether in the 14th century. Tabraham (2002, p.2) follows this later pattern, using "inner close" for the small courtyard by the Grant Tower, "outer close" for the northern enclosure, and "service close" for the southern enclosure.</ref> The curtain walls of both enclosures date largely to the 14th century, though much augmented by later building, particularly to the north where most of the remaining structures are located.<ref name=gifford217/>

===Nether Bailey===
The 16th-century gatehouse is on the inland side of the Nether Bailey, and comprises twin D-plan towers flanking an arched entrance passage. Formerly the passage was defended by a [[portcullis]] and a double set of doors, with guard rooms either side. Over the entrance are a series of rooms which may have served as accommodation for the castle's keeper.<ref name=gifford217>Gifford (1992), p.217</ref> Collapsed masonry surrounds the gatehouse, dating from its destruction after 1690.<ref name=tab4/> 

The Nether Bailey, the main focus of activity in the castle since around 1400,<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.8</ref> is anchored at its northern tip by the Grant Tower, the main [[tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]] or [[keep]]. The tower measures {{convert|12|by|11|m}}, and has walls up to {{convert|3|m}} thick.<ref name=mr94>MacGibbon & Ross (1889), p.94</ref> The tower rests on 14th-century foundations, but is largely the result of 16th-century rebuilding.<ref name=gifford220/> Originally of five storeys, it remains the tallest portion of the castle despite the southern wall collapsing in a storm in the early 18th century. The standing parts of the parapet, remodelled in the 1620s,<ref name=gifford220/> show that the corners of the tower were topped by [[corbel]]led [[bartizan]]s (turrets).<ref name=mr94/> Above the main door on the west, and the [[postern]] to the east, are [[machicolations]], narrow slots through which objects could be dropped on attackers. The western door is also protected by its own ditch and drawbridge,<ref name=gifford220>Gifford (1992), p.220</ref> accessed from a cobbled "Inner Close" separated from the main bailey by a gate.<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.10</ref> The surviving interior sections can still be accessed via the circular staircase built into the east wall of the tower. The interior would have comprised a hall on the first floor, with rooms on another two floors above, and attic chambers in the turrets. Rooms on the main floors have large 16th-century windows, though with small pistol-holes below to allow for defence.<ref name=gifford220/>

To the south of the tower is a range of buildings built against the thick, [[buttress]]ed, 14th-century curtain wall. The [[great hall]] occupied the central part of this range, with the lord's private apartments of [[great chamber]] and [[solar (room)|solar]] in the block to the north, and kitchens to the south.<ref>Gifford (1992), p.219</ref> The foundations of a rectangular building stand on a rocky mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.9</ref>

=== Upper Bailey ===
The Upper Bailey is focused on the rocky mound at the south-west corner of the castle. The highest part of the headland, this mound is the site of the earliest defences at Urquhart. [[Vitrified fort|Vitrified]] material, characteristic of early medieval fortification, was discovered on the slopes of the mound, indicating the site of the early medieval fortification identified by Professor Alcock. In the 13th century, the mound became the [[motte]] of the original castle built by the Durwards, and the surviving walls represent a "[[shell keep]]" (a hollow enclosure) of this date. These ruins are fragmentary, but indicate that there were towers to the north and south of the shell keep.<ref name=gifford221/>

A 16th-century water gate in the eastern wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to the shore of the loch.<ref name=MR93>MacGibbon & Ross (1889), p.93</ref> The adjacent buildings may have housed the stables.<ref>Tabraham (2002), p.6</ref> To the south of this, opposite the motte, is the base of a [[Dovecote|doocot]] (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a [[Forge|smithy]].<ref name=gifford221>Gifford, p.221</ref><ref>Tabraham (2002) p.7</ref>
