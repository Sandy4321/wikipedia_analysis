It was written by [[Max Martin]], [[Shellback (producer)|Shellback]], [[Bonnie McKee]], Oliver Goldstein, Oscar Holter and Jakke Erixson, with production done by Martin and Shellback. Having originally collaborated with other producers in her earlier works, Aguilera stated that the "full circle" her career had taken became the right time to work with Martin. The song combines [[dancepop]], [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] and [[pop music]] genres, and is influenced by [[electronica]] and [[Trance music|trance]]. Its [[instrumentation]] incorporates [[Synthesizers|synths]], drums and electronicas.

"Let There Be Love" garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Many praised Aguilera for not over singing and delivering a solid vocal performance, while others complimented the musical structure and composition. It was also deemed as one of the best songs on ''Lotus'' and that it would have been a better lead single option over "[[Your Body (Christina Aguilera song)|Your Body]]". Upon the release of ''Lotus'', the song debuted on the South Korea [[Gaon Single Chart|international singles chart]] at number 92 with [[Music download|digital download]] sales of 2,945. Aguilera has performed the song at the [[American Music Awards of 2012|40th American Music Awards]] and on ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' in the United States.

I like them to come from a personal place&nbsp;... I'm very excited. It's fun, exciting, introspective, it's going to be great".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a373459/christina-aguilera-new-album-is-quality-over-quantity.html|title=Christina Aguilera: 'New album is quality over quantity'|work=''[[Digital Spy]]''|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=May 27, 2012|accessdate= October 5, 2012}}</ref> Recorded at MXM Studios by [[Shellback (producer)|Shellback]] in Stockholm, Sweden, "Let There Be Love" was written by [[Max Martin]], [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Bonnie McKee]], Oliver Goldstein, Oscar Holter and Jakke Erixson.<ref name="Notes"/> It was produced by Martin and Shellback.<ref name="Notes"/> Aguilera's vocals were recorded by Oscar Ramirez at The Red Lip's Room, Beverly Hills in Beverly Hills in California; the background vocals engineer was Sam Holland.<ref name="Notes"/> Programming and keyboards were carried out by Shellback and additional keyboards were performed by Holter, Erixson and Martin.<ref name="Notes"/>

==Development==
Aguilera explained how she and Max Martin had met early on in her career, but it was a creative and mutual decision not to collaborate with each other at that stage in her career as she wanted to explore different avenues.<ref name="AguileraExplainsSong"/> However, she felt at this point in her career with ''Lotus'', it was the right time to work together, stating:

<blockquote>I definitely don't go the straight and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was at a time when we had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like [[Linda Perry]] and do that route and do "[[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)|Beautiful]]" and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.<ref name="AguileraExplainsSong">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPX-n5llwg4|title=Let There Be Love (The Lotus Album Preview)|publisher=[[VEVO]]|date=November 6, 2012|accessdate=November 27, 2012}}</ref></blockquote>
