'''Uilleam II of Ross''' was the second successor of [[Fearchar, Earl of Ross|Ferchar mac in tSagairt]], as [[Mormaer]] of [[Ross]] (1274<U+2013>1323).

At the beginning of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] Uilleam was captured fighting against the English at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)]]. After which, like many Gaelic lords, he became pro-English and one of the most early enemies of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]], [[Earl of Carrick]]. Uilleam had been in English custody, but his wife Euphemia had obtained his release, and Uilleam was appointed [[Edward I of England]]'s warden of Scotland north of the [[Grampians]]. 

When a band of Bruce supporters, including the [[Earl of Atholl|Countess of Atholl]], Bruce's wife [[Elizabeth de Burgh]], his daughter [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]] and Robert's brother [[Niall Bruce|Niall]] took refuge in [[Saint Duthac|St Duthac]]'s chapel in [[Tain]], Uilleam arrested them and handed them over to the English crown. The men were executed. {{Dubious|date=April 2008}}

This put Uilleam in a dangerous position when the Bruce revival began in the same year, 1306. He found himself being attacked by Bruce in the south, and by [[Lachlan MacRuadridh]] (Lord of the [[Isle of Skye]]), Uilleam's nominal vassal, but Bruce's ally, in the west. When Bruce came north in 1308, Uilleam submitted, receiving his Mormaerdom back from Bruce, along with a pardon and the [[burgh]] of [[Dingwall]]. This bribe and the realities of power kept Uilleam in the Bruce camp. Uilleam was chief of the [[Clan Ross]] who fought on the side of the Bruce against the English at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. Uilleam was a signatory of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]]. Uilleam had six children, one of whom, [[Aodh, Earl of Ross]], succeeded him when he died in 1323.

William's wife Euphemia was previously known only as 'a lady named Euphemia, who warmly supported the English party' [Scots Peerage VII:234].  She has been identified as Euphemia de Berkeley, or Barclay, daughter of Sir Hugh de Berkeley, Justiciar of Lothian (1258<U+2013>1276, d. bef 28 August 1296).
