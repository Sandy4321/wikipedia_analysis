'''Jean Webster''' (pseudonym for '''Alice Jane Chandler Webster''', July 24, 1876 <U+2013> June 11, 1916) was an American writer and author of many books including ''[[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|Daddy-Long-Legs]]'' and ''[[Dear Enemy (novel)|Dear Enemy]]''. Her best-known books feature lively and likeable young female protagonists who come of age intellectually, morally, and socially, but with enough humor, snappy dialogue, and gently biting social commentary to make her books palatable and enjoyable to contemporary readers.

== Childhood ==
Alice Jane Chandler Webster was born in [[Fredonia, New York]]. She was the eldest child of Annie Moffet Webster and Charles Luther Webster. She lived her early childhood in a strongly matriarchal and activist setting, with her great-grandmother, grandmother and mother all living under the same roof. Her great-grandmother worked on [[Temperance movement|temperance issues]] and her grandmother on racial equality and [[women's suffrage]].<ref name="simpson">{{cite book| last =Simpson | first =Alan | coauthors = Mary Simpson with Ralph Connor| title =Jean Webster: Storyteller | publisher =Tymor Associate | year =1984| location =Poughkeepsie | id =B0006EFCTE Library of Congress Catalog Number 84<U+2013>50869}}</ref>

Alice's mother was niece to [[Mark Twain]], and her father was Twain's business manager and subsequently publisher of many of his books by Charles L. Webster Publishing, founded in 1884. Initially the business was successful, and when Alice was five the family moved to a large brownstone in [[New York City|New York]], with a summer house in [[Long Island]]. However, the publishing company ran into difficulties, and increasingly the relationship with Mark Twain deteriorated. In 1888, her father had a breakdown and took a leave of absence, and the family moved back to Fredonia. He subsequently committed suicide in 1891 from a drug overdose.<ref name="simpson"/>

Alice attended the [[Fredonia Normal School]] and graduated in 1894 in china painting.
From 1894 to 1896, she attended the Lady Jane Grey School in [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] as a boarder. During her time there, the school taught academics, music, art, letter-writing, diction and manners to about 20 girls. The Lady Jane Grey School inspired many of the details of the school in Webster's novel ''[[Just Patty]]'', including the layout of the school, the names of rooms (Sky Parlour, Paradise Alley), uniforms, and the girls' daily schedule and teachers. It was at the school that Alice became known as Jean. Since her roommate was also called Alice, the school asked if she could use another name. She chose "Jean", a variation on her middle name. Jean graduated from the school in June 1896 and returned to the Fredonia Normal School for a year in the college division.<ref name="simpson"/>

==College years==
In 1897, Webster entered [[Vassar College]] as a member of the class of 1901. Majoring in English and economics, she took a course in welfare and penal reform and became interested in social issues.<ref name="simpson"/> As part of her course she visited institutions for "delinquent and destitute children".<ref name=intro>{{cite book

Her experiences at Vassar provided material for her books ''[[When Patty Went to College]]'' and [[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|''Daddy-Long-Legs'']]. Webster began a close friendship with the future poet [[Adelaide Crapsey]] who remained as her friend until Crapsey's death in 1914.<ref name="simpson"/> [[Image:Vassar College ca 1862.jpg|400px|left|Vassar College in ca 1862]] 

She participated with Crapsey in many extracurricular activities, including writing, drama, and politics. Webster and Crapsey supported the [[Social Democratic Party (United States)|socialist]] candidate [[Eugene V. Debs]] during the 1900 presidential election, although as women they were not allowed to vote. She was a contributor of stories to the ''Vassar Miscellany''<ref name=intro/> and as part of her sophomore year English class, began writing a weekly column of Vassar news and stories for the ''[[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] Sunday Courier''.<ref name="simpson"/> Webster reported that she was "a shark in English" but her spelling was reportedly quite eccentric, and when a horrified teacher asked her authority for a spelling error, she replied "Webster", a play on name of the dictionary of the same name.<ref name="simpson"/><ref name=intro/>

Webster spent a semester in her junior year in Europe, visiting [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], but with [[Italy]] as her main destination, including visits to [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]] and [[Florence]]. She traveled with two fellow Vassar students, and in Paris met Ethelyn McKinney and Lena Weinstein, also Americans, who were to become lifelong friends. While in Italy, Webster researched her senior economics thesis "Pauperism in Italy". She also wrote columns about her travels for the Poughkeepsie Sunday Courier, and gathered material for a short story, "Villa Gianini", which was published in the ''Vassar Miscellany'' in 1901. She later expanded it into a novel, ''[[The Wheat Princess]]''. Returning to Vassar for her senior year, she was literary editor for her class yearbook, and graduated in June 1901.<ref name="simpson"/>

==Adult years==
Back in Fredonia, Webster began writing ''[[When Patty Went to College]]'', in which she described contemporary women's college life. After some struggles finding a publisher, it was issued in March 1903 to good reviews. Webster started writing the short stories that would make up ''[[Much Ado about Peter]]'', and with her mother visited Italy for the winter of 1903<U+2013>4 including a 6-week stay in a convent in [[Palestrina]], while she wrote the ''Wheat Princess''. It was subsequently published in 1905.<ref name="simpson"/>

The following years brought a further trip to Italy and an eight month world tour to [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Myanmar|Burma]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Indonesia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[China]] and [[Japan]] with Ethelyn McKinney, Lena Weinstein and two others, as well as the publication of ''[[Jerry Junior]]'' in 1907 and ''[[The Four Pools Mystery]]'' in 1908.<ref name="simpson"/>

An increasing intimacy and a secret engagement developed between Webster and Ethelyn McKinney's brother, Glenn Ford McKinney. A lawyer, he had struggled to live up to the expectations of his wealthy and successful father. Mirroring a subplot of ''Dear Enemy'', he had an unhappy marriage to an unstable woman, Annette Reynaud, who was frequently hospitalized for manic-depressive episodes. The McKinneys had a child, John, who also showed signs of mental instability. McKinney responded to these stresses with frequent escapes on hunting and yachting trips as well as alcohol abuse. He entered sanatoriums on several occasions as a result. The McKinneys separated in 1909, but in an era when divorce was uncommon and difficult to obtain, were not divorced until 1915. After his separation, McKinney continued to struggle with alcoholism, but had his addiction under control in the summer of 1912, when he traveled with Webster, Ethelyn McKinney and Lena Weinstein to [[Ireland]].<ref name="simpson"/>

During this period, Webster continued to write short stories and began adapting some of her books for the stage. In 1911, ''[[Just Patty]]'' was published, and Webster began writing the novel ''[[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|Daddy-Long-Legs]]'' while staying at an old farmhouse in [[Tyringham, Massachusetts]]. Webster's most famous work was originally published as a serial in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'' and tells the story of a girl named Jerusha Abbott, an orphan whose attendance at a women's college is sponsored by an anonymous benefactor. Apart from an introductory chapter, the novel takes the form of letters written by the newly-styled Judy to her benefactor. It was published in October 1912 to popular and critical acclaim.<ref name="simpson"/>

Webster dramatized ''Daddy-Long-Legs'' during 1913, and in 1914 spent four months on tour with the play, which starred a young [[Ruth Chatterton]] as Judy. After tryouts in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], and [[Chicago]], the play opened at the [[Gaiety Theatre (New York)|Gaiety Theatre]] in New York City in September 1914 and ran until May 1915. It subsequently toured widely throughout the US. The book and play became a focus for efforts for charitable work and reform. "Daddy-Long-Legs" dolls were sold to raise money to fund the adoption of orphans into families. 

Webster's success was overshadowed by her college friend Adelaide Crapsey's battle with [[tuberculosis]], leading to Crapsey's death in October 1914. In June 1915, Glenn Ford McKinney was granted a divorce, and he and Webster were married in a quiet ceremony in September in [[Washington, Connecticut]]. They honeymooned at McKinney's camp near [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]], and were visited by former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref>{{cite book

Returning to the US, the newlyweds shared Webster's apartment overlooking [[Central Park]] and McKinney's Tymor farm, in [[Dutchess County, New York]]. In November 1915, ''[[Dear Enemy (novel)|Dear Enemy]]'', a sequel to ''Daddy-Long-Legs'', was published, and it too proved to be a bestseller.<ref name= keely>{{Cite journal

She also began a book and play set in [[Sri Lanka]]. Her friends reported that they had never seen her happier.<ref name="simpson"/>

== Death ==
Jean Webster entered the Sloan Hospital for Women, New York on the afternoon of June 10, 1916. Glenn McKinney, recalled from his twenty-fifth reunion at [[Princeton University]], arrived ninety minutes before Webster gave birth at 10:30 p.m to a six-and-a-quarter-pound daughter. All was well initially, but Jean Webster became ill and died of [[Puerperal fever|childbirth fever]] at 7:30 am on June 11, 1916. Her daughter was named Jean (Little Jean) in her honor.<ref name=simpson/>

== Themes ==
Jean Webster was active political and socially, and often included issues of interest in her books.<ref name = keely/>

=== Women's issues ===
Jean Webster supported [[women's suffrage]] and education for women. She participated in marches in support of votes for women, and having benefited from her education at Vassar, she remained actively involved with the college. Her novels also promoted the idea of education for women, and her major characters explicitly supported women's suffrage.<ref name = keely/>

===Eugenics and heredity ===
The [[eugenics]] movement was a hot topic when Jean Webster was writing her novels. In particular, [[Richard L. Dugdale]]'s 1877 book about the [[The Jukes family|Juke family]] as well as [[Henry H. Goddard|Henry Goddard]]'s 1912 study of the [[The Kallikak Family|Kallikak family]] were widely read at the time. Webster's ''Dear Enemy'' mentions and summarizes the books approvingly, to some degree, although her protagonist, Sallie McBride, ultimately declares that she doesn't "believe that there's one thing in heredity," provided children are raised in a nurturing environment.  Nevertheless, eugenics as an idea of 'scientific truth'<U+2014> generally accepted by the intelligentsia of the time<U+2014> does come through in the novel.

===Institutional reform ===
From her college years, Webster was involved in reform movements, and was a member of the State Charities Aid association, including visiting orphanages, fundraising for dependent children and arranging for [[adoption]]s. In ''Dear Enemy'' she names as a model the ''Pleasantville Cottage School'', a cottage-based orphanage that Webster had visited.
