The '''1866 Atlantic hurricane season''' was also one of only four [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane seasons]] in which every known [[tropical cyclone]] attained hurricane status, along with [[1852 Atlantic hurricane season|1852]], [[1850-1859 Atlantic hurricane seasons|1858]], and [[1884 Atlantic hurricane season|1884]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Initially, there were three known storms during the season, although a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis|re-analysis]] confirmed the increased activity.<ref name="year"/> There were also two other systems that were included as tropical cyclones at one time, although both were considered to have been other storms already in the database. All tropical activity occurred between the middle of July and the end of October. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist [[Christopher Landsea]] estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]]|volume=88|number=18|date=2007-05-01|pages=197<U+2013>208|title=Counting Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Back to 1900|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-01-18|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/landsea-eos-may012007.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Every storm but the fourth hurricane affected land during the season. The first hurricane hit [[Matagorda, Texas]] in July, the only one of the season to hit the United States as a hurricane. A month later a hurricane made two landfalls in Mexico. The third hurricane of the season formed near Bermuda and was last observed along the southern coast of [[Newfoundland]]. A few weeks later another storm executed a similar track, although it struck Newfoundland as a hurricane and caused damage. The most notable storm of the season was the Great Nassau Hurricane, which killed at least 383&nbsp;people in the [[Turks and Caicos]], [[Bahamas]], and the western Atlantic Ocean. It attained winds of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h), which is a Category&nbsp;4 on the modern-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. The final hurricane developed over the Bahamas and later struck New Jersey, producing strong winds and high tides across New England.

The first hurricane of the season was observed on July&nbsp;11, when a schooner encountered heavy seas to the south of [[Florida]]. As the hurricane moved westward, it remained a short distance off the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], bringing strong winds to [[New Orleans]] on July&nbsp;12. High tides surrounded the lighthouse at [[Timbalier Bay]] for about 24&nbsp;hours, prompting the [[lighthouse keeper]] to resign from loneliness and of fear of the weather.<ref name="meta">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2011|title=Documentation of Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Changes in HURDAT|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-06-04|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata_master.html}}</ref> 

On July&nbsp;15, the hurricane moved ashore near [[Matagorda Bay]] in [[Texas]], with winds estimated around 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h), or a Category&nbsp;2 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]]. At landfall, the minimum [[barometric pressure]] was estimated at 969&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]].<ref name="us">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2011|title=Continental U.S. Hurricanes:  1851 to 1930, 1983 to 2010|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-06-04|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/usland1851-1930&1983-2010-Mar2011.html}}</ref> The hurricane's strong winds broke all of the boats from their moorings in the Matagorda harbor.

On August&nbsp;13, a ship encountered a severe hurricane in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Based on observations, it is estimated the hurricane attained winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h). There were no reports for several days, although based on continuity it is estimated the storm passed south of Jamaica on August&nbsp;15. The following day, the hurricane struck the eastern [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], washing seven boats ashore. It is estimated to have weakened to a tropical storm while moving over land, although the system re-intensified into a hurricane in the [[Bay of Campeche]]. It made its second and final landfall near [[Veracruz]] before dissipating on August&nbsp;18.<ref name="year"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

The third hurricane of the season was first encountered on September&nbsp;4 by a ship {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Bermuda]]; the vessel sustained damage to its [[Mast (sailing)|foretopmast]]. The storm affected another ship later that day, leaving similar heavy damage. Tracking generally northeastward, the hurricane was last observed on September&nbsp;7 near [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].<ref name="year"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

===Hurricane Four===
On September&nbsp;18 and for two days subsequently, a [[barque]] sailed through a hurricane near the [[Cape Verde]] islands. The vessel was en route from New York to Shanghai, but due to a leak from the storm it had to return to New York for repairs.<ref name="year"/> Aside from a single reported location, the track of the hurricane is unknown.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

A ship named "Honduras" observed the fifth hurricane of the season on September&nbsp;22 to the south-southeast of [[Nova Scotia]]. The ship lost its masts and sails from the storm, and based on the observations the winds were estimated around 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h). Additional ship reports indicated the hurricane maintained a northeast track toward Newfoundland. Late on September&nbsp;23 the hurricane made landfall in south-central Newfoundland, although it quickly weakened to tropical storm intensity. The winds spread across much of the island, severing the telegraphs in and around [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]. Late on September&nbsp;24 the storm was last observed to the north of the island.<ref name="year"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

Known as the ''Great Nassau Hurricane of 1866'',<ref name="meta"/> the sixth hurricane of the season was also the longest-lasting. The brig "Jarien" encountered the hurricane on September&nbsp;24 to the west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. The track is unknown for the following five days, until another ship reported a hurricane about 20&nbsp;miles (32&nbsp;km) north of [[Anegada]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]]. The hurricane affected the [[Leeward Islands]], washing several ships ashore and destroying a pier in [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]]. On September&nbsp;30 through the following day, the cyclone moved through the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], becoming what was considered "one of the most terrific hurricanes ever known". About 75% of the population was left homeless and broke.<ref name="year"/>

After affecting the Turks and Caicos Islands, the hurricane passed through the Bahamas. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed over [[Nassau]], where a [[barometric pressure]] of 938&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.70&nbsp;[[Inches of Mercury|inHg]]) was reported.<ref name="year"/> Based on the observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="meta"/> The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs.<ref name="year"/> After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward,{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October&nbsp;4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force&nbsp;11 winds on the [[Beaufort scale]].<ref name="year"/> The hurricane was last observed on October&nbsp;5 to the southeast of [[Atlantic Canada]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, the hurricane killed at least 383&nbsp;people, making it among the 100 [[List of deadliest Atlantic hurricanes|deadliest Atlantic hurricanes]] as of 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Edward N.

The final hurricane of the season was first observed on October&nbsp;28 over the Bahamas. It moved north-northwestward through the island chain, followed by a turn to the north-northeast over the western Atlantic. Several ships encountered the hurricane, and one lost their supply of molasses.<ref name="year"/> On October&nbsp;30, the cyclone struck on the southern end of [[Long Beach Island]] with winds of 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), having weakened from hurricane strength.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2011|title=Continental United States Tropical Storms:  1851-1930, 1983-2010|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-06-09|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/uststorms1851-1930&1983-2010-may11.html}}</ref> As it moved through the northeastern United States, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, causing flooding near [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. In [[Brooklyn]], the storm moved the rail cars off their tracks, while in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] the winds destroyed three buildings and wrecked the roofs of two others. Further northeast, the storm disrupted shipping and cut telegraph lines, although no fatalities were reported. The storm was last observed over Vermont late on October&nbsp;30, by which time it was acquiring [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical characteristics]].<ref name="year"/>
