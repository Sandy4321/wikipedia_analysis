==Early career==
Tan began as a child model, doing catalog work beginning at age 12,<ref>{{cite video | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNa0C8JXL4s&feature=relmfu | title = Mika Tab Interview | time = 02:00 | publisher = HollymoodEntertainment.com via [[YouTube]] | accessdate = June 18, 2012}}</ref>and also appeared as an extra in movies and television, including in the movie ''[[Operation Dumbo Drop]]'';<ref>''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNa0C8JXL4s&feature=relmfu Mika Tan Interview]'', HollymoodEntertainment.com, 02:52.</ref> commercials, the theater.<ref name=informercial>[http://www.gramponante.com/2006/04/my-good-porn-friday.html http://www.gramponante.com/2006/04/my-good-porn-friday.html]</ref> She was a member of the Movement Company dance troupe of [[Guam]], where she performed [[modern jazz]] and [[ballet]].<ref name=resume>[http://www.mikatan.com/pages/work/resume.htm Mika Tan: Resume]</ref>

Tan studied at [[San Diego State University]], where she earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[Biochemistry]]. She also has an [[Associate's degree]] in [[Psychology]]. She did nude [[Model (art)|art modeling]] and was a stripper in nightclubs to support herself as a student.<ref name=modeling>[http://google.com/search?q=cache:gIQgnoJYPxUJ:blog.myspace.com/index.cfm http://blog.myspace.com] Interview by Vincent P Davis</ref><ref name=lukeisback_mika/><ref name=faq/>

Tan studied classical voice at the Magdalena Per<U+00E9>s School of Voice and says she is a graduate of the [[John Robert Powers]] [[finishing school]].<ref name=resume/>

Despite her aptitude for science, she did not enjoy it and worked in sales and marketing in the [[timeshare]] industry<ref name=whoami>[http://www.mikatan.com/pages/bio/whoami.htm Mika Tan: About Me<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for [[Dennis Hof]]. Hof was later quoted as saying, "She is straight as an arrow; I had no idea she leaned that way; I would have approached her to work for my Moonlite Bunny Ranch back then!"  

She tried her hand at acting in California, but quit after discovering that the [[casting couch]] is not a myth.<ref name=faq>[http://www.mikatan.com/pages/bio/FAQ.htm Mika Tan: F-A-Q<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> She has been quoted as saying, "For the record, no adult entertainment director, producer, or crewman has ever sexually harassed me EVER. If I have to fuck for work, then I'll just fuck for work. Sure, the sex acts are documented, but at least the payoff is guaranteed in porn."

Tan appeared on the American television show ''[[Blind Date (U.S. TV series)|Blind Date]]'' in 2006 in an episode titled "Scott and Mika/Pat and Michelle".<ref>[http://www.tv.com/Blind+Date/Scott+and+Mika-Pat+and+Michelle/episode/922380/summary.html?tag=container;episode_guide_list TV.com > Blind Date].

[[File:Mika Tan at KSEXradio Listener Choice Awards 2006 (5).JPG|thumb|right|upright|Mika Tan in 2006.]]

Tan primarily does [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]-oriented work, including work as a [[dominatrix]] and sub for the [[Kink.com]] group of companies, mostly the "Men in Pain" and "Divine Bitches" websites, where her intense performances have made her a favorite. She also stars in non-fetish oriented work. She considers herself mainly a fetish model rather than a porn star. The official biography on her website states: "For the record, I do not consider myself a porn star and any girl who has done less than 250 films shouldn't either."<ref name=whoami /> Though she still does hardcore sex films, she also appears in story driven features, such as  "Memoirs of a Modern-Day Geisha" (2006) ([[VCA Pictures|VCA]]).

As of December 2007, Tan had done over 1,350 fetish and hardcore scenes for video and the internet. She takes orders for custom videos through her website. Fans are told to submit a script, scenario, and choice of cast. In return, she will make the custom video for a nominal fee plus production costs.

When contract star [[Kaylani Lei]] resigned as the host on the ''Me So Horny'' internet radio show on [[KSEX]], Tan replaced her, alongside [[Annie Cruz]]. Tan left the United States in June 2007 to handle some family legal issues for several months. Shortly afterwards, the cast and crew from KSEX all moved to RUDE.TV.

Tan has now moved into production, with her debut film featuring heterosexual Asian-American men in hardcore scenes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mika Tan Starts Production House|url=http://avn.com/video/articles/26301.html|accessdate=2007-08-29}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> She is semi-retired, but manages four shoot locations, works as a certified makeup artist, studies film editing and post-production marketing, and works as an independent consultant who prepares random, time-coded quality control reports for the largest adult DVD distribution company, ensuring their fetish films do not contain scenes depicting non-consensual penetration (bound rape scenarios, abductions, or other acts which may be considered obscene or illegal by United States standards).

Since March 2009, Tan has been working as a legal prostitute at the [[Moonlite BunnyRanch]] brothel in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bunny Ranch - Mika Tan|url=http://www.bunnyranch.com/bunnybabes/MikaTan.php|accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref> She identifies as [[bisexuality|bisexual]].<ref>[http://www.mikatan.com/pages/bio/FAQ.htm Mika Tan: F-A-Q].
