==History==
English sailors traded ammunition and guns to the French from [[Fort Caroline]] for food and a boat in 1565, the first international commerce recorded in the New World. Because of this, the port uses the phrase, ''Jacksonville: America's First Port''. After Cowford was renamed Jacksonville, a petition dated June 15, 1822, was sent to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]], asking him to designate the city as a [[port of entry]] for the United States.<ref name=HIST>[http://www.jaxport.com/about/history/history.html "Jacksonville: America's First Port"] Jaxport</ref>

Jacksonville's [[St. Johns River]] is one of the best natural seaports in the Southeast, and shipping has always been an important component of the local economy. Before Florida became a state in 1845, cotton and timber were traded and shipped at the port. 
The [[Great Fire of 1901]] destroyed the port facilities as well as most of the city. Docks and wharfs were among the first items rebuilt by businesses. In 1907, the federal government helped pay for main channel in the river to be dredged to a depth of 24 feet. The city of Jacksonville began to exert control over the 160-acre port at Talleyrand in 1912 and a $1.5 million bond referendum passed in 1913 to pay for construction of municipal docking facilities.  
The [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] performed the harbor dredging in 1916, 1952, 1978 and 2003, when the channel was deepened to 30 feet, 34 feet, 38 feet and 41 feet, respectively.
  
The [[United States Navy]] had no base at the Port of Jacksonville until shortly before [[World War II]] when two facilities were constructed.<ref>[http://www.coj.net/About+Jacksonville/Jacksonville+History.htm "A Rich & Vibrant History"] City of Jacksonville, About Jacksonville</ref> Today, the [[Naval Station Mayport]], [[Naval Air Station Jacksonville]], [[Blount Island Command]] ([[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]) and nearby [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay]] form the third largest military presence in the United States.<ref>[http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/USA_FL_Port_of_Jacksonville_225.php "Port of Jacksonville"] World Port Source, Port Detail</ref>

Following the war, little or no money was spent on the ''public'' docks at the port, and they deteriorated until many were unusable. Because of this, Jacksonville missed out on much of the shipping boom of the [[Post-World War II economic expansion]].<ref name=HIST /> 

In addition to the military bases at the port, more than 20 maritime facilities in Jacksonville's harbor are privately owned and operated, including [[drydock]]s and petroleum terminals.

==Port Authority==
{{Main|Jacksonville Port Authority}}
The '''Jacksonville Port Authority''' (JPA) was created in 1963 by a special act of the Florida Legislature.<ref>[http://www.jaxport.com/about/history.cfm "Jacksonville: America's First Port"] Jaxport, History</ref>
The authority, also known as ''JAXPORT'', is the independent government agency that owns, operates and controls much of Jacksonville<U+2019>s Seaport System, including (but not limited to) the following: docks and wharfs, cranes, a passenger cruise terminal,warehouses, paved open storage areas, and road connections to the public highway system. JAXPORT maintains these facilities and manages their overall use. Private companies pay lease and rental fees to JAXPORT in order to operate from the seaport. This revenue funds the day-to-day operations so that public tax dollars are not required. JAXPORT does not operate or manage private boat marinas, water taxis or bridges.

The port has always taken security seriously; after the [[September 11 attacks]], thwarting terrorism became the focus.  Security guards are on constant patrol, supported by the ''Seaport Security Unit'', made up of 11 officers and 2 sergeants on contract from the [[Jacksonville Sheriff's Office]]<ref>[http://www.coj.net/Departments/Sheriffs+Office/Homeland+Security+Division/Seaport+Security+Unit.htm "Seaport Security Unit"] City of Jacksonville, Jacksonville Sheriffs Office</ref>. [[Department of Homeland Security]] also has a presence with [[United States Customs Service]] and [[United States Border Patrol]] agents. The port has three areas of activity: cargo, cruises and ferry service.

==Cargo==
The port has three separate cargo facilities: Blount Island, Tallyrand and Dames Point.

===Blount Island===
{{Main|Blount Island}}
'''Blount Island''' lies nine nautical miles (16.7km) from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and is one of the largest vehicle import/export centers in the United States.<ref name=BLOUNT>[http://www.jaxport.com/sea/blount.cfm "Blount Island"] Jacksonville Port Authority, Seaports</ref>
The [[United States Marine Corps]] uses 1,100 acres on the east side of the island for its' [[Maritime Prepositioning ship|Maritime Prepositioning Force]] operations, and the public ''Blount Island Marine Terminal'', which is JAXPORT's largest container facility, occupies 754-acres on the west half of the island.<ref name=NAVY /> Blount Island can also process [[Roll-on/roll-off|Ro/Ro]], [[heavy lift]], breakbulk and liquid bulk cargoes on 6,600 linear feet (2,012m) of deep water (41') berths.<ref name=BLOUNT />

===Tallyrand===
The oldest marine facility at JAXPORT is the ''Tallyrand Marine Terminal'', located 21 nautical miles (33.8km) from the Atlantic. The 173-acre facility handles automobiles (import), liquid [[bulk cargo|bulk commodities]], [[break bulk cargo]] and [[Containerization|containerized cargo]]. With six container cranes, on-dock rail service and a 160,000 ft<sup>2</sup> transit shed, the terminal can process frozen, refrigerated or ambient cargo on 4,780 linear feet (1,457m) of deepwater (38') berthing space. A half million square foot warehouse is available to store many types of cargoes.<ref>[http://www.jaxport.com/sea/talley.cfm "Talleyrand Marine Terminal"] JAXPORT</ref>

===Dames Point===
The newest marine facility at JAXPORT is the nearly 600-acre ''Dames Point Marine Terminal''.<ref name=HIST /> Situated one mile upstream from Blount Island on the main shipping channel, Dames Point presently has only one tenant: the 158-acre TraPac Container Terminal used by [[Mitsui O.S.K. Lines]]. Space is available to store bulk aggregate material. [[Hanjin Shipping]] has reserved 90 acres for their container terminal, which is projected to open during 2013.<ref>[http://www.jaxport.com/sea/dames.cfm Dames Point Marine Terminal"] JAXPORT</ref>

The JAXPORT "temporary" cruise facility is located at the northwest corner of Dames Point. There is a plan to remove this structure and construct a permanent facility elsewhere when economic conditions improve.<ref name=SITES>Dixon, Drew: [http://jacksonville.com/community/shorelines/2010-05-20/story/jacksonville-port-authority-looking-20-sites-possible-cruise?quicktabs_1=1 "Jacksonville Port Authority looking at 20 sites for possible cruise ship terminal"] Florida Times-Union, May 20, 2010</ref>

==Cruises==
{{Main|JAXPORT Cruise Terminal}}
A "temporary" '''JAXPORT Cruise Terminal''' was constructed in six months during 2003 near the [[Dames Point Bridge]]. The cruise facility contains 63,000 ft<sup>2</sup>; the baggage handling area is 28,000 ft<sup>2</sup>; and a passenger embarkation section has 15,000 ft<sup>2</sup>. Vehicle access to the site is via Hecksher Drive and there is paved parking for over 800 cars.<ref>[http://www.jaxport.com/sea/c_terminal.cfm "Cruise Terminal"] Jacksonville Port Authority, Cruise Terminal</ref> 

[[Celebrity Cruises]] began regular service from Jacksonville on October 27, 2003 on the [[MV Zenith]].<ref name=HIST /> Celebrity discontinued their service from Jacksonville when the Zenith was retired from their fleet in 2007.   

The ship [[Carnival Miracle]] was christened at the Port of Jacksonville on February 27, 2004, beginning Jacksonville service by [[Carnival Cruise Lines]]. The Miracle was replaced by [[Carnival Fascination]], which was still based in Jacksonville as of May, 2010. 
Cruises visit the [[Bahamas]], [[Mexico]], [[Key West]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref>[http://www.jacksonvillecruiseguide.com/ "Jacksonville Cruises"] Jacksonville Cruises</ref>

Five cruise ships (including the Carnival Miracle) were chartered to serve as floating hotels during the week preceeding [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] in February, 2005. Four of the vessels docked at JAXPORT terminals, and they provided over 3,500 rooms plus restaurants and night clubs for fans.<ref>[http://jacksonville.com/superbowl/cruiseships/ "Super Bowl XXXIX cruise ships"] Florida Times-Union, January, 2005</ref>

The [[Jacksonville Port Authority]] had plans to relocate the cruise terminal. In 2008, an 8-acre parcel was purchased in the small fishing village of Mayport as the site of a permanent, $60 million facility. The economic crisis delayed the project, and opposition from local residents was vehement; a lawsuit seeking an injunction was filed against the JPA. In May, 2010, the authority announced that they were starting over and reviewing all possible locations for the cruise terminal.<ref name=SITES />

==Ferry service==
The [[Mayport Ferry]] crosses the [[St. Johns River]], connecting [[Naval Station Mayport|Mayport]] to [[Fort George Island Cultural State Park|Fort George Island]]. The 0.9 mile crossing is part of [[Florida State Road A1A]] and departs every half hour. The ferry has been operating since 1948 and is the last active ferry in Florida.<ref>[http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2840732-st_johns_river_ferry_jacksonville-i "St. Johns Ferry"] Yahoo travel</ref>

The [[Florida Department of Transportation]], which had always operated the service, had the Mayport Ferry line item budget vetoed by Governor [[Charlie Crist]] for 2007-2008.<ref>Manwell, Frank: [http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/36371581/S-E-AND-GULF-PORTS "Steamboat Bill, 2007"] Encyclopedia Britannica, S. E. AND GULF PORTS</ref>  Rather than terminate the service, the City of Jacksonville assumed responsibility, but lost over $1 million in one year.
Mayor [[John Peyton]] announced that there was no money available in the next budget. 
The Jacksonville Port Authority took over operation of the ferry in 2007 and raised the standard fare from $3.25 to $5.00, but still lost half a million dollars each year. However, they use port revenue, not tax money, to underwrite the operation.<ref>Dixon, Drew: [http://jacksonville.com/community/shorelines/2009-07-01/story/mayport_ferry_ridership_down_some_worried_service_could_go_awa "Mayport ferry ridership down, some worried service could go away"] Florida Times-Union, July 1, 2009</ref>
After taking over, the JPA decided to cut costs and sell the ''Blackbeard'', the backup vessel built in 1956. That meant that whenever the ''Jean Ribault'' had problems, ferry service would be suspended. On February 5, 2009 the ferry was put into dry dock for routine maintenance, but hull corrosion required an extra week of repairs, and there was no service for a month.<ref>Dixon, Drew: [http://jacksonville.com/community/shorelines/2009-03-07/story/a_month_and_940_000_later_mayport_ferry_back_in_service "A month and $940,000 later, Mayport ferry back in service"] Florida Times-Union, March 7, 2009</ref>
