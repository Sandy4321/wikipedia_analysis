'''''The Simpsons''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] created by [[Matt Groening]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. It is a [[satire|satirical]] parody of the [[middle class]] [[United States|American]] lifestyle epitomized by its titular [[Simpson family|family]], which consists of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. The show is set in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], and it lampoons many aspects of the [[human condition]], as well as [[American culture]], [[society]] as a whole, and  [[television]] itself.

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with the producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a [[dysfunctional family]] and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on [[April 19]], [[1987]].<ref name="goodnight">Richmond, p. 14</ref> After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour [[prime time]] show and was an early hit for Fox. 

Since its debut on [[December 17]], [[1989]], the show has broadcast [[List of The Simpsons episodes|414 episodes]] and is currently in its [[The Simpsons (season 19)|nineteenth season]]. The season 18 finale, which aired on [[May 20]], [[2007]], was the show<U+2019>s [[You Kent Always Say What You Want|400th episode]], and 2007 marked the 20th anniversary of ''The Simpsons'' franchise. ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on [[July 26]] and [[July 27]], [[2007]], and has grossed approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]526.2 million worldwide to date.

''The Simpsons'' has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 23 [[Emmy Award]]s, 26 [[Annie Award]]s and a [[Peabody Award]]. ''[[TIME|Time]]'' magazine's [[December 31]], [[1999]] issue named it the 20th century's best television series,<ref name="century">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,993039,00.html|title=The Best Of The Century|accessdate=2007-06-03|date=[[1999-12-31]]|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''}}</ref> and on [[January 14]], [[2000]] it was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Origins==
{{main|History of The Simpsons|The Simpsons shorts}}
Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' series. However, when Groening realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a [[dysfunctional family]].<ref name=inter>{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = David Bianculli| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM|WHYY]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008| city = Philadelphia| date = [[2003-02-14]]| accessdate = 2007-08-08}}</ref> He named the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/>

[[Image:Simpsons on Tracey Ullman.png|thumb|250px|left|The [[Simpson family]] as they first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]].'']]
The [[Simpson family]] first appeared as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on [[April 19]]  [[1987]].<ref name="goodnight"/>  Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> 

In 1989, a team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The team included what is now the [[Klasky Csupo]] animation house. Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=568&IssueNum=32|title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer'|accessdate=2006-09-01|author=Kuipers, Dean|date=[[2004-04-15]]|publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat}}</ref> Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.<ref name="toonterrific">{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker||title=Toon Terrific|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=[[1993-03-12]]|page=48(3)}}</ref> The half-hour series premiered on [[December 17]], [[1989]] with "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", a [[Christmas special]].<ref name=officialsite>[http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0101.htm "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"] ''The Simpsons.com''.

''The Simpsons'' was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows.<ref name="rating89">{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1989.htm|title=TV Ratings: 1989<U+2013>1990|accessdate=2006-07-03|publisher=ClassicTVHits.com}}</ref> Its success prompted Fox to reschedule the series to compete with ''[[The Cosby Show]],'' a move that hurt the ratings of ''The Simpsons.''<ref name="avclub1">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/1|title=Matt Groening: Interview|accessdate=2006-10-22|author=Rabin, Nathan|date=[[2006-04-26]]|publisher=The A.V.

The show was controversial from its beginning.

With one exception, episode credits list only the [[voice actor]]s, and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; James L.

Episodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. [[Tony Bennett]] was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode "[[Dancin' Homer]]".<ref>Turner, p. 393</ref> ''The Simpsons'' holds the [[Guinness Book of World Records|world record]] for "Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series".<ref name="Foxflash">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z2z2z175z13z3|title=THE SIMPSONS - Season 19 (2007-2008|accessdate=2007-10-21|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|FoxFlash]]}}</ref>

The main cast has been involved in much-publicized pay disputes with Fox on more than one occasion. In 1998, they threatened to strike, forcing [[20th Century Fox]] to increase their salary from $30,000 per episode to $125,000. The series creator Groening supported the actors in their action.<ref>{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Doherty|title=Matt Groening|publisher=''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''|date=March/April 1999}}</ref> The show's revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales, the main cast stopped appearing for script readings in April 2004. The work stoppage occurred after weeks of unsuccessful negotiations with Fox, in which the cast asked for an increase in their pay to $360,000 per episode, or $8 million over a 22-episode season. On [[May 2]], [[2004]], the actors reached an agreement with Fox.<ref>{{cite news|first=Rick|last=McGinnis|title=Star talks Simpsons|publisher=''[[Metro International|metro]]''|date=[[2004-08-09]]}}</ref>

The show has been dubbed into [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|several other languages]], including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. It is also one the few programs dubbed in both [[French language|French]] and [[Quebec French]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omnivore.org/jon/orwell/caste.htm|title=Caste Of Characters|accessdate=2007-08-07|date=[[2000-09-09]]|author=Kay, Jonathan|publisher= ''Saturday Night Magazine''}}</ref> ''The Simpsons'' has been broadcast in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], but due to [[Islam]]ic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks [[Carbonated water|soda]] instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the life-long ''Simpsons'' fans in the area.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05287/588741.stm|title=D'oh!

They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old [[activist]]; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], a baby who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a [[pacifier]]. The family owns a dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], and a cat, [[Snowball II]]. Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons [[unageing|do not physically age]] and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s.

The show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.<ref name="avclub1"/>

==Themes==
{{main|List of The Simpsons episodes}}
{{seealso|Politics in The Simpsons|Religion in The Simpsons}}

''The Simpsons'' uses the standard setup of a situational comedy or "[[sitcom]]" as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town.<ref name="Turner28"/> However, because of its animated nature, ''The Simpsons'''s scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment.<ref>Turner, p. 55</ref> Through Bart and Lisa's days at [[Springfield Elementary School]], the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels<U+2014>from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.<ref>Turner, p. 388</ref> 

Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias.<ref>Turner, pp. 221<U+2013>222</ref> [[Al Jean]] admitted in an interview that "We [the show] are of liberal bent."<ref name="turner223">Turner, p. 223</ref> The writers often evince an appreciation for progressive ideals, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum.<ref>Turner, p. 224</ref> The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker.<ref name="turner223"/> Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In ''The Simpsons'', politicians are corrupt, ministers such as [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.<ref>Turner, p. 56</ref> Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mark I|last=Pinsky|title=The Gospel According to Homer|publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''|date=[[1999-08-15]]}}</ref>

==Hallmarks==
===Opening sequence===
{{main|The Simpsons opening sequence}}
{{seealso|Chalkboard gag|couch gag}}
[[Image:Simpsons couch gag.jpg|thumb|250px|Shot from an overblown, extended [[couch gag]] (often used when an episode is running short). [[Media:The Simpsons Opening Credits Circus Couch Gag.ogg|Watch]]]]
''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[Title sequence|opening sequence]] is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. Most episodes open with the camera zooming through the show's title towards the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The opening was created by [[David Silverman]], the first task he did when production began on the show.<ref name=silverinter>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page4.shtml|title=Top titles|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> The series' distinctive theme song was [[composer|composed]] by [[musician]] [[Danny Elfman]] in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece, which took two days to create, has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.<ref name="elfman">{{cite web|url=http://elfman.filmmusic.com/elfman_la_times.html|title=Danny Elfman in the L.A. Times|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Glionna, John M.|year=1999|publisher=Danny Elfman's Music For A Darkened People}}</ref>

One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that several segments are changed from episode to episode. Bart writes something different on the school chalkboard,<ref name=silverinter/> Lisa may play a different solo on her saxophone and a different visual gag accompanies the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.<ref>Richmond, pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref>

===Halloween episodes===
{{main|Treehouse of Horror (series)}}
[[Image:Bart Night Gallery.jpg|thumb|210px|right|Bart introducing a segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]" in the manner of [[Rod Serling]]'s ''[[Night Gallery]]''.]]
The special [[Halloween]] episode has become an annual tradition.  "[[Treehouse of Horror]]" first broadcast in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode.<ref name="BBCI">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml|title=The Simpsons Halloween Special|accessdate=2007-11-09|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> These pieces usually involve the family in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres.<ref>Turner, p. 31</ref>  They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the ''Treehouse'' series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years, new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox's current contract with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII|last=Ryan|first=Andrew|publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date=[[2006-11-04]]|pages=p. 12}}</ref>

===Humor===
{{main|Recurring jokes in The Simpsons}}
The show's humor also turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show.<ref name="referential">Turner pp. 63<U+2013>65</ref> Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history.<ref name="referential"/> Whenever possible, the animators also put jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, and elsewhere.<ref name="turner62">Turner p. 62</ref> The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show.<ref name="turner62"/> Kristin Thompson argues that ''The Simpsons'' uses a "...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show."<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book|last=King |first=Geoff |authorlink=Kristin Thompson |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=New Hollywood Cinema: An Introduction |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate=2007-12-18|edition= |series= |date=2002-03-29|publisher=I B Tauris & Co |location= |isbn=1860647502 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>

The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each.<ref>Turner p. 60</ref> Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", Mr. Burns' "Excellent..." and Nelson Muntz's "''Ha''-ha!". Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as "''[[<U+00A1>Ay, caramba!]]''", "Don't have a cow, man!" and "Eat my shorts!" appeared on t-shirts in the show's early days.<ref>Turner p. 25</ref> However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode "[[Bart Gets Famous]]" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the Krusty the Clown Show for saying "I didn't do it."<ref>Turner p. 61</ref>

==Influences on culture==
===Influences on language===
[[Image:Matt Groening.jpg|right|200px|thumb|''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]].]]
A number of [[neologism]]s that originated on ''The Simpsons'' have entered the popular vernacular.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47756|title=Beyond "D'oh!": Simpsons Quotes For Everyday Use|author=Bahn, Christopher|coauthors=Donna Bowman, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Nathan Rabin, Tasha Robinson, Kyle Ryan, Scott Tobias|accessdate=2006-07-03|date=[[2006-04-26]]|publisher=The A.V.

The director of ''The Simpsons'' told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known exclamation in the TV series.<ref name="doh">{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Simon|title=Wisdom from The Simpsons' 'D'ohh' boy|format=Interview|publisher=''The Daily Northwestern''|date=[[1994-02-11]]}}</ref>

Other ''Simpsons'' expressions that have entered popular use include "excellent" (drawn out as a sinister "eeeexcelllent<U+2026>" in the style of Charles Montgomery Burns), Homer's triumphant "Woohoo!" and Nelson Muntz's mocking "HA-ha!" [[Groundskeeper Willie]]'s description of the [[France|French]] as "[[cheese-eating surrender monkeys]]" was used by conservative ''[[National Review]]'' columnist [[Jonah Goldberg]] in 2003, after France's opposition to the proposed [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

===Influence on television===
''The Simpsons'' was the first successful animated program in prime time since ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'' in the 1970s.<ref>Alberti, p. xii.</ref> During most of the 1980s, pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. ''The Simpsons'' changed this perception.<ref name="animation"/> The use of Korean animation studios doing [[Tweening|in-betweening]], coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of ''The Simpsons'' and the lower production cost prompted television networks to take chances on other animated series.<ref name="animation"/> This development led to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', and ''[[The Critic]]''.<ref name="animation"/> ''South Park'' later paid homage to ''The Simpsons'' with the episode "[[Simpsons Already Did It]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1647470,00.html|title=The Simpsons Did It!|accessdate=2007-08-01|date=[[2007-07-29]]|author=Richard Corliss|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''}}</ref>

''The Simpsons'' has also influenced live-action shows like ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', which debuted [[January 9]], [[2000]] in the time slot after ''The Simpsons''.<ref name="influence"/><ref name="malcolm">{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2000/jan00/news30107.html|title='Malcolm in the Middle': trite Fox fare with a first-rate time slot|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Wallenstein, Andrew|publisher=''Media Life Magazine''}}</ref> ''Malcolm in the Middle'' featured the use of [[sight gag]]s and did not use a [[laugh track]] like most [[sitcom]]s. [[Ricky Gervais]] has called ''The Simpsons'' a major influence on his British comedy ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', which also dispenses with a laugh track.<ref name="gervais">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/interviews/ricky-gervais.html|title=Ricky Gervais Part One|accessdate=2006-12-20|author=Schuchardt, Richard|publisher=DVDActive.com}}</ref>

==Reception and achievements==
''The Simpsons'' has been praised by many critics, being described as "the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html|title=Eye pleasers|accessdate=2008-01-27|publisher=''[[The Boston Phoenix]]''|author=Ted Drozdowski|date=1997}}</ref> In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described it as "the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons.

===Run length achievements===
On [[February 9]] [[1997]], ''The Simpsons'' surpassed ''[[The Flintstones]]'' with the episode "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]" as the longest-running [[prime-time]] animated series in the United States. In 2004, ''The Simpsons'' replaced ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or [[live action]]) in the United States.<ref name="longsitcom"/> In October 2004, ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' briefly overtook ''The Simpsons''  as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3949579.stm |title=Scooby-Doo breaks cartoon record| accessdate=2006-08-21|date=[[2004-10-25]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> However, network executives in April 2005 again cancelled ''Scooby-Doo'', which finished with 371 episodes, and ''The Simpsons'' reclaimed the title with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season.<ref name="Guinness"/> In May 2007, ''The Simpsons'' reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season. While ''The Simpsons'' has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=lastforever>{{cite news|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/83-11152007-1441491.html|title=Some records will last forever|accessdate=2007-11-17|date=[[2007-11-15]]|publisher=PhillyBurbs.com|author=Andy Vineberg}}</ref> For example, the Japanese [[anime]] series ''[[Sazae-san#Sazae-san animated series|Sazae-san]]'' has close to 2,000 episodes to its credit.<ref name=lastforever/>

The year 2007 marks the twentieth anniversary of the Simpsons franchise. With its nineteenth year (2007<U+2013>2008), the series will be only one season behind ''[[Gunsmoke]]'s'' US primetime, scripted television record of 20 produced seasons. However, ''Gunsmoke's'' episode count of 635 episodes far surpasses ''The Simpsons'', which would not reach that mark until its 29th season, under normal programming schedules.<ref name="longsitcom"/>

===Criticism of declining quality===  	 
For many years, critics' reviews of new ''Simpsons'' episodes praised the show for its wit, realism, and intelligence.<ref name="toonterrific"/><ref name="calgary">{{cite news |first=Bob|last=Remington|title=It's The Simpsons, Man|publisher=TV Times (''[[Calgary Herald]]'')|page=10|date=[[1990-10-26]]}}</ref> In the late-1990s, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change.

''The Simpsons'' managed to maintain a large viewership and attract new fans.

I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before.

===DVDs===

Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=2338|title=Chapelle's Show<U+2014>S1 DVD Passes ''The Simpsons'' As #1 All-Time TV-DVD; Celebrates by Announcing Season 2!|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Lambert, David|date=[[2004-09-19]]|publisher=TVshowsonDVD.com}}</ref> In particular, seasons one through ten have been released on DVD in the US ([[DVD region code|Region 1]]), Europe ([[DVD region code|Region 2]]) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America ([[DVD region code|Region 4]]) with more seasons expected to be released in the future.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaselist.cfm?ShowID=3824&Studio=2 DVD release dates] at [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]].

===Video games===
{{main|The Simpsons video games}}
The [[video game]] industry was quick to adapt the characters and world of Springfield into games. Some of the early games include [[Konami]]'s [[arcade game]] ''[[The Simpsons (arcade game)|The Simpsons]]'' (1991) and [[Acclaim Entertainment]]'s ''[[The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants]]'' (1991). More modern games include ''[[The Simpsons Road Rage]]'' (2001), ''[[The Simpsons Hit & Run]]'' (2003) and ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'' (2007).

==Film==

{{main|The Simpsons Movie}}
[[20th Century Fox]], [[Gracie Films]], and [[Film Roman]] produced an animated ''The Simpsons'' film that was released on [[July 27]] [[2007]].<ref name="simpsonmovie">{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940840?categoryid=14&cs=1|title=Homer going to bat in '07|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Fleming, Michael|date=[[2006-04-02]]|publisher=Variety.com}}</ref>  The film was directed by long-time ''Simpsons'' producer [[David Silverman]] and written by a team of ''Simpsons'' writers comprising Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Al Jean, George Meyer, [[Mike Reiss]], [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Jon Vitti]], [[David Mirkin]], [[Mike Scully]], [[Matt Selman]], and [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]].<ref name="simpsonmovie"/> Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded.<ref name="simpsonmovie"/> There had been talk of a possible feature-length Simpsons film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode "[[Kamp Krusty]]" was suitable for a film, but encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mark Kirkland, David Silverman|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Kamp Krusty"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project.<ref name="avclub3"/>

After winning a Fox and ''[[USA Today]]'' competition, [[Springfield, Vermont]] hosted the film's world premiere.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6910174.stm|title=Simpsons launch hits Springfield|accessdate=2007-07-22|date=[[2007-07-21]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> ''The Simpsons Movie'' grossed a combined total of $74 million in its opening weekend in the US, taking it to the top of the box office,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2007&wknd=30&p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office July 27<U+2013>29, 2007|accessdate=2007-07-29|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref> and set the record for highest grossing opening weekend for a film based on a television series, surpassing ''[[Mission Impossible II]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20048748,00.html|title=Raking in the d'oh! |author=Joshua Rich|accessdate=2007-07-30|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref> It opened at the top of the international box office, taking $96 million from seventy-one overseas territories &mdash; including $27.8 million in the United Kingdom, making it Fox's second highest opening ever in that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN2936859520070730|title="Simpsons Movie" rules foreign box office|accessdate=2007-07-30|date=[[2007-07-29]]|author=Frank Segers|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> In Australia, it grossed [[AU$]]13.2 million, the biggest opening for an animated film and third largest opening weekend in the country.<ref>{{cite news | author = Patrick Kolan | title = Simpsons Movie Breaks Records | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-07-30]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/809/809446p1.html | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> As of [[December 17]], [[2007]] the film has a worldwide gross of $526,622,545.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=simpsons.htm|title=The Simpsons Movie|accessdate=2007-12-20|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>
