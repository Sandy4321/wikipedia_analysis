The '''''sebastophoros''''' ({{lang-el|<U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C6><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}) was a high [[Byzantine]] court position and rank reserved for [[eunuch]]s in the 10th<U+2013>12th centuries. Its functions are unclear.

== History and functions ==
The office is first attested in the ''[[Escorial Taktikon]]'' of ca. 975. [[Nicolas Oikonomides]] suggested that it was introduced sometime between 963 and 975.<ref name="Guilland199">Guilland (1963), p. 199</ref><ref name="ODB1862">Kazhdan (1991), p. 1862</ref><ref name="Oikonomides">Oikonomides (1972), p. 308</ref> In the ''Escorial Taktikon'' it is ranked as one of the highest dignities, after the ''[[proedros]]'' and before the ''[[magistros|magistroi]]'',<ref>Oikonomides (1972), p. 262</ref> and was usually reserved for eunuchs.<ref name="ODB1862"/><ref>Guilland (1963), pp. 200, 202</ref> 

The first known holder was Romanos Lekapenos, the son of [[Stephen Lekapenos]] and grandson of emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920<U+2013>944),<ref name="ODB1862"/><ref name="RomanosLekapenos">Guilland (1963), pp. 200<U+2013>201</ref> but Oikonomides suggested that the title may have been first created for [[Basil Lekapenos]], the powerful ''[[parakoimomenos]]'' and long-time first minister.<ref>Guilland (1963), pp. 199<U+2013>200</ref>

The functions of the ''sebastophoros'' are unclear; the name may imply that he carried the emperor's banner, or that he was a personal messenger of the emperor, a role some of its holders are known to have fulfilled.<ref name="ODB1862"/><ref name="Oikonomides"/> The title was quickly devalued, already during the 11th century: on seals, it is combined with relatively modest offices in the imperial hierarchy. It disappeared completely after the 12th century.<ref name="ODB1862"/><ref name="Oikonomides"/>

In some texts, namely the ''[[Patria of Constantinople]]'' and the ''[[Suda]]'' lexicon, the ''sebastophoroi'' are identified as officials of the districts (''regeonai'', "regions") of [[Constantinople]], who every year on 5 October performed dances before the emperor. This statement however comes from the 6th-century antiquarian writer [[John Lydus]], who alleges that this practice existed under Emperor [[Tiberius]] (r. 14<U+2013>37), i.e. in [[Rome]].<ref name="Guilland199"/><ref name="ODB1862"/>

==Known holders==
* Romanos Lekapenos, grandson of [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920<U+2013>944), he was castrated while young in 945, and was probably still alive in 975.<ref name="RomanosLekapenos"/>
* [[Stephen Pergamenos]], eunuch official who notified [[Constantine IX Monomachos]] (r. 1042<U+2013>1055) of his accession in 1042, and was rewarded with the dignity of ''sebastophoros''. He suppressed the revolt of [[George Maniakes]], but later conspired against the emperor and was [[tonsure]]d.<ref>Guilland (1963), pp. 201<U+2013>202</ref>
* [[Nikephoritzes]], the unpopular eunuch chief minister of [[Michael VII Doukas]] (r. 1071<U+2013>1078). He bore the title during his tenure as ''[[dux|doux]]'' of Antioch in 1059<U+2013>1060.<ref>Guilland (1963), pp. 203<U+2013>205</ref>
* John Pepagomenos, household member (''oikeios'') of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081<U+2013>1118), attested in the synod that condemned [[John Italos]] in 1092.<ref>Guilland (1963), p. 202</ref>

A few other seals of ''sebastophoroi'' are known from the 10th<U+2013>12th centuries, but their owners are not otherwise known.<ref>Guilland (1963), pp. 203, 205</ref>
