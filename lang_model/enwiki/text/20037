'''Roger Joseph Ebert''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>i<U+02D0>b<U+0259>rt}}; born June 18, 1942) is an American [[film criticism|film critic]] and [[screenwriter]]. ''[[Forbes]]'' has described him as "the most powerful [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]] in America".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/09/21/pundit-americas-top-oped-cx_tvr_0924pundits.html |title=The Top Pundits in America |accessdate=9 December 2008 |author=Riper, Tom Van |date=24 September 2007 |publisher=Forbes.com}}</ref>

He is known for his film review column (appearing in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' since 1967, and later online)<ref name="site">[http://www.rogerebert.com RogerEbert.com]</ref> and for the [[television program]]s ''[[Sneak Previews]]'', ''[[At the Movies (1982<U+2013>1990 TV series)|At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]]'', and ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel and Ebert and The Movies]]'', all of which he co-hosted for a combined 23 years with [[Gene Siskel]]. After Siskel's death in 1999, Ebert teamed with [[Richard Roeper]] for the television series ''Ebert & Roeper & the Movies'', which began airing in 2000. Although his name remained in the title, Ebert did not appear on the show after mid-2006, when he suffered post-surgical complications related to [[Thyroid neoplasm|thyroid cancer]] which left him unable to speak. Ebert ended his association with the show in July 2008,<ref name=Statement>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080721/FEATURED/150028057 Ebert, Roger; "Statement from Roger Ebert" rogerebert.suntimes.com; July 21, 2008]</ref> but in February 2009 he stated that he and Roeper would continue their work on a new show.<ref name=NewShow>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN Roger Ebert. "By the time we get to Phoenix, he'll be laughing" RogerEbert.com; February 18, 2009]</ref>

Ebert's movie reviews are [[print syndication|syndicated]] to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and worldwide by [[Universal Press Syndicate]]. He has written more than 15 books, including his annual movie yearbook which is predominantly a collection of his reviews of that year. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win a [[Pulitzer Prize for Criticism|Pulitzer Prize]].<ref name=TheTimes>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article7048776.ece | last=Wade | first=Mike | title=US film critic rediscovers his voice ... in Edinburgh | publisher=[[The Times]] | date=March 4, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> His television programs have been widely syndicated and have been nominated for [[Emmy]] awards. In February 1995, a section of Chicago's Erie Street near the [[CBS Studios]] was renamed ''Siskel & Ebert Way''. In June 2005, Ebert was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He was the first professional film critic to receive such an award. He has [[honorary degree]]s from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], the [[AFI Conservatory]], and the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].

Since 1994, he has written a ''Great Movies'' series of individual reviews of what he deems to be the most important films of all time. This list and his associated reviews have now expanded to include over 300 movies. Since 1999, he has hosted the annual [[Ebertfest: Roger Ebert's Film Festival|Roger Ebert's Film Festival]] in [[Champaign, Illinois]].

==Early life and education==
Roger Joseph Ebert<ref name=YouTubeInterview>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTYVnuKnJNo Interview with Roger Ebert; [[YouTube]]; May 20, 2008]</ref> was born in [[Urbana, Illinois]], the son of Annabel and Walter H. Ebert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/91/Roger-Ebert.html |title=biography of Roger Ebert |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> His paternal grandparents were [[German people|German]] immigrants<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020412/REVIEWS/204120305/1023 Ebert's review of ''Maryam''] (April 12, 2002)</ref> and his maternal ancestry is Dutch and Irish.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/05/_i_interrupt_my_regularly.html | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Oh, say, can you wear?}}</ref> Ebert's interest in journalism began as a student at [[Urbana High School (Illinois)|Urbana High School]], where he was a sports writer for ''The News-Gazette'' in [[Champaign, Illinois]]; however, he began his writing career with letters of comment to the [[science fiction]] [[science fiction fanzines|fanzines]] of the era.<ref name="site"/> He became involved in [[science fiction fandom]],<ref>See his autobiographical essay in [[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]], [http://www.asimovs.com/_issue_0501/thoughtexperiments.shtml "Thought Experiments: How Propeller-Heads, BNFs, Sercon Geeks, Newbies, Recovering GAFIAtors, and Kids in the Basements Invented the World Wide Web, All Except for the Delivery System."]</ref> writing articles for [[fanzines]], including [[Richard A. Lupoff]]'s [[Xero (SF fanzine)|''Xero'']]. In his senior year he was co-editor of his [[school newspaper|high school newspaper]], ''The Echo''.  In 1958, Ebert won the [[Illinois High School Association]] state [[Individual Events|speech]] championship in Radio Speaking, an event that simulates radio newscasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihsa.org/activity/ie/records/ybych1.htm |title=Roger Ebert in the IHSA list of state speech champions |publisher=Ihsa.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

Regarding his early influences in film critiquing, Ebert wrote in the 1998 parody collection ''Mad About the Movies'':
:"I learned to be a movie critic by reading Mad magazine... Mad's parodies made me aware of the machine inside the skin<U+2014>of the way a movie might look original on the outside, while inside it was just recycling the same old dumb formulas. I did not read the magazine, I plundered it for clues to the universe. [[Pauline Kael]] lost it at the movies; I lost it at Mad magazine."<ref>Foreword to ''Mad About the Movies'', Mad Books, 1998, ISBN 1-56389-459-9</ref>

After briefly attending the [[University of Chicago]], Ebert received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], where he was editor of ''[[The Daily Illini]]''<ref name="SunTimes60Years">[http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/history/781830,CST-NWS-high07.stng "Ebert Named Film Critic" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. February 7, 2008. page 57.]</ref> and member of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity. One of the first movie reviews he ever wrote was a review of ''[[La dolce vita]]'', published in ''The Daily Illini'' in October 1961.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19611004/REVIEWS/50809001/1023 Ebert's review of ''La Dolce Vita''] (October 4, 1961)</ref> After Ebert wrote an article on the death of writer [[Brendan Behan]] for ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' editor Herman Kogan, Ebert was given a job as a reporter and feature writer at the ''Sun-Times'' in 1966. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the paper, editor Robert Zonk gave the job to Ebert.<ref name="SunTimes60Years"/>

==Career==
Ebert began his professional critic career in 1967, writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. That same year, Ebert's first book, a history of the [[University of Illinois]] titled ''Illini Century: One Hundred Years of Campus Life'' was published by the University's press.

In 1969, his review of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 Ebert<U+2019>s review of ''Night of the Living Dead''] January 5, 1967</ref> was published in ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.

Ebert co-wrote the screenplay for the 1970 [[Russ Meyer]] film ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' and likes to joke about being responsible for the film, which was poorly received on its release but is now regarded as a [[cult classic]]. Ebert and Meyer also made ''[[Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens]]'', ''[[Up! (1976 film)|Up!]]'', and others, and were involved in the ill-fated [[Sex Pistols]] movie ''[[Who Killed Bambi? (1978 film)|Who Killed Bambi?]]'' In April 2010, Ebert posted his screenplay of "Who Killed Bambi?" aka "Anarchy in the UK" on his blog.<ref>[http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/who_killed_bambi_-_a_screenpla.html Ebert, Roger. ""Who Killed Bambi?" - A screenplay" ''Chicago Sun-Times]''; April 25, 2010</ref>
[[File:Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert.jpg|thumb|right|Roger Ebert (right) with [[Russ Meyer]] in 1970.]]
Since the 1970s, Ebert has worked for the [[University of Chicago]] as a guest lecturer, teaching a night class on film. His fall 2005 class was on the works of the German director [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]].

In 1975, Ebert and [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' began co-hosting a weekly [[film]] review [[television show]], ''[[Sneak Previews]]'', which was locally produced by the Chicago [[public broadcasting]] station [[WTTW]]. The show was picked up by [[PBS]] in 1978 for national distribution. In 1982, the critics moved to a [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] commercial television show named ''[[At the Movies (1982<U+2013>1990 TV series)|At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert]]'', and in 1986 they left to create ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel & Ebert & The Movies]]'' with [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] (part of [[Disney]]).  The duo was known for their "thumbs up/thumbs down" review summaries.
When Siskel died in 1999, the producers retitled the show ''Roger Ebert & the Movies'' with rotating co-hosts. In September 2000, fellow ''Chicago Sun-Times'' columnist [[Richard Roeper]] became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper]]''.

On January 31, 2009, Ebert was made an honorary life member of the [[Directors Guild of America]] during the group's annual awards ceremony.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081217/film_nm/us_ebert "Directors Guild to honor Roger Ebert" [[Yahoo! News]]/[[Reuters]]/''[[Hollywood Reporter]]''; December 17, 2008]</ref>

Ebert ended his association with Disney in July 2008, after the studio indicated they wished to take ''At the Movies'' in a new direction. He and Gene Siskel's widow, Marlene Iglitzen Siskel,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20129634,00.html|last=Gliatto|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Gliatto|title=Despite the Loss of Film-Critic Buddy Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert Gives Life a Thumbs-Up|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date= 1 November 1999}}</ref> still own the trademark phrase "Two Thumbs Up."<ref name=Statement/> On February 18, 2009, Ebert reported that he and Roeper would soon announce a new movie review program.<ref name=NewShow/> Ebert reiterated this plan after Disney announced the last episode of the program would air in August 2010.<ref>''[[TV Guide]]''; April 12, 2010; Page 64.</ref>

===Style of critique and personal tastes===
Ebert has described his critical approach to films as "relative, not absolute"; he reviews a film for what he feels will be its prospective audience, yet always with at least some consideration as to its value as a whole. He awards four stars to films of the highest quality, and generally a half star to those of the lowest unless he considers the film to be "artistically inept" and/or "morally repugnant", in which case it will receive no stars.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19820101/REVIEWS/201010315/1023 ''Death Wish II'' review by Roger Ebert]</ref>
{{quote|When you ask a friend if ''[[Hellboy (film)|Hellboy]]'' is any good, you're not asking if it's any good compared to [[Mystic River (film)|''Mystic River'']], you're asking if it's any good compared to [[The Punisher (2004 film)|''The Punisher'']]. And my answer would be, on a scale of one to four, if [[Superman (film)|''Superman'']] is four, then ''Hellboy'' is three and ''The Punisher'' is two. In the same way, if [[American Beauty (film)|''American Beauty'']] gets four stars, then ''[[The United States of Leland]]'' clocks in at about two.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040423/REVIEWS/404230305/1023 Ebert's review of ''Shaolin Soccer''] (April 23, 2004)</ref>}}

Ebert has emphasized that his star ratings have little meaning if not considered in the context of the review itself. Occasionally (as in his review of ''[[Basic Instinct 2]]''), Ebert's star rating may seem at odds with his written opinion. Ebert has acknowledged such cases, stating, "I cannot recommend the movie, but ... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, ''that'' would be a reason."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060330/REVIEWS/60323008 Ebert's review of ''Basic Instinct 2''] (March 21, 2006)</ref> In August 2004 [[Stephen King]], in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve.<ref>[[King, Stephen]], [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,681657,00.html "The Four-Star Follies"], August 20, 2004. Retrieved January 31, 2008.</ref> In his review of ''[[The Manson Family (film)|The Manson Family]]'', Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that didn't count as a recommendation ''per se''. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]'' a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the [[Cannes Film Festival]], he recommended readers not see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050526/REVIEWS/50510003/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Longest Yard'' (2005 version) at rogerebert.com; May 27, 2005]</ref> He also declined to give a star rating to ''[[The Human Centipede]]'', arguing that the rating system was "unsuited" to such a film: "Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100505/REVIEWS/100509982 Ebert's review of ''The Human Centipede'' at rogerebert.com; May 5, 2010]</ref>

Ebert has reprinted his starred reviews in movie guides. In his appearances on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', he was frequently challenged to defend his ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception<U+2014>when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' a three-star rating in 1974, but had subsequently given ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' three and a half stars. Ebert later added ''The Godfather Part II'' to his "Great Movies" list in October, 2008 stating that his original review has often been cited as proof of his "worthlessness" but he still hasn't changed his mind and wouldn't change a word of his original review.<ref name="ebertgm">{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | coauthors = | title = ''The Godfather, Part II :: rogerebert.com :: Great Movies'' | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = October 2, 2008 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081002/REVIEWS08/810020300/1023 | accessdate = 2010-02-28 }}</ref>

Ebert has occasionally accused some films of having an unwholesome political agenda, and the word "[[fascist]]" accompanied more than one of Ebert's reviews of the law-and-order films of the 1970s such as ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. He is also suspicious of films that are passed off as art, but which he sees as merely lurid and sensational. Ebert has leveled this charge against such films as ''[[The Night Porter]].''<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750210/REVIEWS/502100301/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Night Porter'' at rogerebert.com; February 10, 1975]</ref>

Ebert's reviews can clash with the overall reception of movies, as evidenced by his one-star review of the celebrated 1986 [[David Lynch]] film ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' ("marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots... in a way, [director Lynch's] behavior is more sadistic than the [[Dennis Hopper|Hopper]] character").<ref>{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger| title = Review of ''Blue Velvet''| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860919/REVIEWS/609190301/1023|accessdate= September 4, 2009| work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> He was dismissive of the popular 1988 [[Bruce Willis]] action film ''[[Die Hard]]'' "inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot"),<ref>{{cite news| last = Ebert| first = Roger

Ebert often makes heavy use of mocking [[sarcasm]], especially when reviewing movies he considers bad. At other times he is direct, famously in his review of the 1994 [[Rob Reiner]] comedy ''[[North (film)|North]]'', which he concluded by writing that:
{{quote|I hated this movie. Hated hated hated hated hated this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it.

Ebert's reviews are also often characterized by dry wit.<ref name="Tomato">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1698147/1.php Yamato, Jen; "Meet a Critic: Roger Ebert!: RT chats with America's favorite critic."; rottentomatoes.com; December 19, 2007]</ref>  In January 2005, when [[Rob Schneider]] insulted ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' movie critic [[Patrick Goldstein]], who panned his movie ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]'', by commenting that the critic was unqualified because he had never won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], Ebert intervened by stating that, as a Pulitzer winner, he was qualified to review the film, and bluntly told Schneider, "Your movie sucks."<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50725001%2F1023&AID1=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50725001%2F1023&AID2= Ebert's review of ''Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo'']</ref> Ebert and Schneider would later mend fences regarding this.<ref name=Corliss>[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1636520-2,00.html Richard Corliss.

Ebert has been accused by some [[horror movie]] fans of bourgeois elitism in his dismissal of what he calls "Dead Teenager Movies". Ebert has clarified that he does not disparage [[horror movies]] as a whole, but that he draws a distinction between films like ''[[Nosferatu]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', which he regards as "masterpieces", and films which he feels consist of nothing more than groups of teenagers being killed off with the exception of one survivor to populate a sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/egebertsax2007.html |title=Gurnow, Michael; "Roger Ebert<U+2019>s Bloody Ax: An Examination of the Film Critic<U+2019>s Elitist Dismissal of the Horror Film" |publisher=Horrorreview.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

Ebert has emphasized his general distaste for "top ten" lists, and all movie lists in general,<ref name=FavoriteFilm/> but due to his participation in the 2002 Sight and Sound Directors' poll, he has revealed his top-ten films (alphabetically): ''[[Aguirre, Wrath of God]]''; ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''; ''[[Citizen Kane]]''; ''[[Dekalog (film)|Dekalog]]''; ''[[La dolce vita]]''; ''[[The General (1927 film)|The General]]''; ''[[Raging Bull]]''; ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]''; ''[[Tokyo Story]]''; and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Roger&surname=Ebert |title=How the directors and critics voted |publisher="BFI |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref>

Ebert has long been an admirer of director [[Werner Herzog]], whom he supported through many years when Herzog's popularity had been eclipsed.  He conducted an onstage public "conversation" with Herzog at the Telluride Film Festival in 2004, after a screening of Herzog's film [[Invincible (2001 film)|Invincible]] at the Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival. Herzog dedicated his 2008 film ''[[Encounters at the End of the World]]'' to Ebert, and Ebert responded with a heartfelt public letter of gratitude.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071117/PEOPLE/71117002 |title=Roger Ebert.

In 2005, answering a question from a reader, Ebert opined that [[video game]]s are not art, and are inferior to traditional art forms created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, "video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful", but "the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art".<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN&date=20051127 Roger Ebert. "Why did the chicken cross the genders?" rogerebert.com; November 27, 2005]</ref> This inspired a variety of angry letters from video game enthusiasts.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051206/COMMENTARY/51206002 Roger Ebert. "Gamers fire flaming posts, e-mails..." rogerebert.com; December 6, 2005]</ref> Writer [[Clive Barker]] also defended video games as an art form, stating that they have the power to move people, that the views of book or film critics are less important than those of the consumers experiencing them, and that Ebert's were prejudiced. Ebert responded that the charge of prejudice was merely a euphemism for disagreement, that merely being moved by an experience does not denote it as artistic, and that critics are also consumers.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/COMMENTARY/70721001 Roger Ebert. "Games vs. Art: Ebert vs. Barker" rogerebert.com; July 21, 2007]</ref> Ebert later defended his position in April 2010 in a blog post, saying, "No video gamer now living will survive long enough to experience the medium as an art form."<ref>[http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html Ebert, Roger. "Video games can never be art" Roger Ebert's Journal; April 16, 2010]</ref> He has also stated in the blog posts that he has never found a video game "worthy of (his) time," and thus has never played one. Cracked.com writer Robert Brockway responded by opining that this makes Ebert unqualified to judge video games, and that debating Ebert on such a topic was comparable to "a structured philosophical debate on the importance of pacifism and restraint with a rabid badger: Your opponent is not only unqualified from the start, but it<U+2019>s obviously just out to attack you."<ref>Brockway, Robert.

On 1 July 2010, Ebert published a new blog entry in response to the outcry he received from video gamers. In it, he admitted that his opinion was limited because of the small amount of video games he had played in his lifetime. He reflected about the reaction to his blog and his friends' subsequent attempts to show him games, and his reluctance to play games due to his lack of interest in the medium. He also admitted he had made a mistake in claiming video games would never be art. However, he still maintained his position regarding games as art.<ref>[http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html Roger Ebert.

===Views on the film industry===
Ebert is an outspoken opponent of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]]. He has repeatedly criticized their decisions regarding which movies are "suitable for children." For example, ''[[Whale Rider]]''<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031116/ANSWERMAN/311160302 Ebert's "Movie Answer Man column", [[November 16]], 2003]</ref> and ''[[School of Rock]]''<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031003/REVIEWS/310030304/1023 Ebert's review of ''School of Rock''] (October 3, 2003)</ref> were both rated PG-13 (not recommended for children under the age of 13), while he thought both were inoffensive enough for schoolchildren and contained positive messages for that age group. In his review of [[The Exorcist (film)|''The Exorcist'']], Ebert said it was "stupefying" that the film received a rating of "R" from the MPAA instead of an "X" (suitable only for adults). He has frequently argued that the MPAA is more likely to give an "R" rating for mild sexual content than for highly violent content. In his review of ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', he was quoted as saying:
"I said the film is the most violent I have ever seen. The MPAA's R rating is definitive proof that the organization either will never give the NC-17 rating for violence alone, or was intimidated by the subject matter. If it had been anyone other than Jesus up on that cross, I have a feeling that NC-17 would have been automatic."<ref name=passion>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040224/REVIEWS/402240301/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Passion of the Christ''; [[February 24]], 2004]</ref>

He also frequently laments that cinemas outside major cities are "booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes", making high-quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers.<ref>Ebert, Roger, "[http://web.archive.org/web/20040604184449/http://www.suntimes.com/output/oscars/ebert27.html They got it right]," ''Chicago Sun Times'' (29 January 2004)</ref>

Ebert is a strong advocate for [[Maxivision]] 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, as compared to the usual 24 frames per second. He is opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060219/ANSWERMAN/602190302/1023 |title=Ebert's "Movie Answer Man column", February 19, 2006 |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-17}}</ref> Ebert has been skeptical of the recent resurgence of [[3-D film|3D effects in film]], which he has found unrealistic and distracting.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger | last = Ebert |authorlink =|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/08/dminus_for_3d.html |title=D-minus for 3-D |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times|Chicago Sun-Times: Blogs]]|date=16 August 2008 |accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>

===Film and TV appearances===
Ebert has provided [[DVD]] [[audio commentary|audio commentaries]] for several [[film]]s, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', ''[[Floating Weeds]]'', ''[[Crumb (film)|Crumb]]'', and ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Dolls]]'' (for which Ebert also wrote the screenplay, based on a story that he co-wrote with [[Russ Meyer]]). Ebert was also interviewed by [[Central Park Media]] for an extra feature on the DVD release of the [[anime]] film ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]''.

On the day of the [[Academy Awards]], Ebert and Roeper typically appear on the live pre-awards show, [http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=oscars&id=3928258 ''An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Arrivals''.] This airs prior to the awards ceremony show, which also features [[red carpet]] interviews and fashion commentary. They also appear on the post-awards show entitled ''An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Winners''. Both shows are produced and aired by the [[American Broadcasting Company]]-owned Los Angeles station [[KABC-TV]]. This show also airs on [[WLS-TV]] as well as the network's other owned stations along with being syndicated to several ABC affiliates and other broadcasters outside the country. Ebert did not appear on the 2007 show for medical reasons.

In 1995, Ebert, along with colleague Gene Siskel, guest starred on an episode of the animated TV series ''[[The Critic]]''. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]''.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/the-critic/siskel-and-ebert-and-jay-and-alice/episode/53022/summary.html TV.com] Episode summary: ''The Critic'' - "Siskel & Ebert & Jay & Alice"</ref>

In 1996, Ebert appeared in "Pitch", a documentary by Canadian film makers [[Spencer Rice]] and [[Kenny Hotz]].

In [[2003 in film|2003]], Ebert had a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Abby Singer (film)|Abby Singer]]'', in which he recited the white parasol monologue from ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.

Roger Ebert founded his own film festival, [[Ebertfest]], in his home town of [[Champaign, Illinois]] and is also a regular fixture at the [[Hawaii International Film Festival]].

On May 4, 2010, Ebert was announced by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences as the Webby Person of the Year having taken to the Internet following his battle with cancer.<ref>[http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/specialachievement14.php The Webby Awards]</ref>

On October 22, 2010, Ebert appeared on camera with [[Robert Osborne]] on the [[Turner Classic Movies]] network during the network's "The Essentials" series.  Ebert chose the film ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' to be shown.

===Battle with thyroid cancer===
[[Image:Boutte and Ebert.jpg|249px|thumb|Ebert at the [[Conference on World Affairs]] in September 2002, shortly after his cancer diagnosis]]
In early 2002, Ebert was diagnosed with papillary [[thyroid cancer]]. In February of that year, surgeons at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] were able to successfully remove the cancer with [[clean margins]]. He later underwent surgery in 2003 for cancer in his salivary gland, and in December of that year, underwent a four-week follow-up course of radiation to his [[salivary glands]], which altered his voice slightly. As he battled the illness, Ebert continued to be a dedicated critic of film, not missing a single opening while undergoing treatment.

Ebert underwent further surgery on June 16, 2006, just two days before his 64th birthday, to remove additional cancerous tissue near his right jaw, which included removing a section of jaw bone.<ref name="email">[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060817/PEOPLE/60817001 Email from Roger], August 17, 2006, posted on his website</ref>  On July 1, Ebert was hospitalized in serious condition after his [[carotid artery]] burst near the surgery site and he "came within a breath of death".<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070628%2FREVIEWS%2F70620003%2F1023&AID1=%2F20070628%2FREVIEWS%2F70620003%2F1023&AID2= Ebert's words] in his review of ''[[Sicko]]'', June 29, 2007</ref> He later learned that the burst was likely a side effect of his treatment, which involved [[neutron radiation|neutron beam radiation]].  He was subsequently kept bedridden to prevent further damage to the scarred vessels in his neck while he slowly recovered from multiple surgeries and the rigorous treatment. At one point, his status was so precarious that Ebert had a [[tracheostomy]] performed on his neck to reduce the effort of breathing while he recovered.<ref name="email"/>

Ebert had pre-taped enough TV programs with his co-host [[Richard Roeper]] to keep him on the air for a few weeks; however, his extended convalescence necessitated a series of "guest critics" to co-host with Roeper: [[Jay Leno]] (a good friend to both Ebert and Roeper), [[Kevin Smith]], [[John Ridley]], [[Toni Senecal]], [[Christy Lemire]], [[Michael Phillips (theatre critic)|Michael Phillips]], [[Aisha Tyler]], [[Fred Willard]], [[Anne Thompson (film critic)|Anne Thompson]], [[A.O. Scott]], [[Mario Van Peebles]], George Pennacchio, [[Brad Silberling]], and [[John Mellencamp]]. Michael Phillips later became Ebert's replacement for the remainder of Roeper's time on ''At the Movies'', until mid-2008, when Roeper did not extend his contract with ABC.

In October 2006, Ebert confirmed his bleeding problems had been resolved. He was undergoing rehabilitation at the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]] due to lost muscle mass, and later underwent further rehabilitation at the [[Pritikin Program|Pritikin Center]] in Florida."<ref name="apr07suntimes">[http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/324454,CST-NWS-ebert03.article "Ebert: Despite setbacks, I am feeling better every day", Chicago Sun-Times, April 3, 2007]</ref>  In May 2007, Ebert blogged that he had received a bouquet of flowers from actor [[Rob Schneider]], with a note signed, "Your Least Favorite Movie Star, Rob Schneider".  Ebert took this as a kind gesture despite his negative review of Schneider's ''[[Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]]''.  Ebert described the flowers as "a reminder, if I needed one, that although Rob Schneider might (in my opinion) have made a bad movie, he is not a bad man, and no doubt tried to make a wonderful movie, and hopes to again.  I hope so, too."<ref name=RobBouquet1/><ref name=RobBouquet2/>

After a three-month absence, the first movie he reviewed was ''[[The Queen (film)|The Queen]]''. Ebert made his first public appearance since the summer of 2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak but communicated through his wife, Chaz, through the use of written notes. His opening words to the crowd of devout fans at the festival were a quote from the film he co-wrote with Russ Meyer, ''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls'': "It's my happening and it freaks me out."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070329/FILMFESTIVALS06/70329001|title=Ebertfest '07: "It's his happening and it freaks him out!"|accessdate=September 4, 2009|author=Jim Emerson|date=March 29, 2007 |publisher=rogerebert.suntimes.com}}</ref>  Also in April 2007, in an interview with [[WLS-TV]] in Chicago, he said, "I was told photos of me in this condition would attract the gossip papers&nbsp;<U+2014> so what?"

===Current health===
{{As of|2010|2}}, Ebert has a full-time, live-in nurse attend to him when needed. Although doctors have asked him to allow them to make one more attempt to restore his voice, Ebert has refused, indicating that he is done with surgery, and will likely decline significant intervention even if his cancer returns, as he feels that the last procedure he underwent did more harm than good. Regarding his death one day, he has written in a journal entry titled, "Go Gently into That Good Night":

{{bquote|I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear. I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. What I am grateful for is the gift of intelligence, and for life, love, wonder, and laughter. You can't say it wasn't interesting. My lifetime's memories are what I have brought home from the trip. I will require them for eternity no more than that little souvenir of the [[Eiffel Tower]] I brought home from [[Paris]].<ref name=Esquire/>}}

Ebert employed a Scottish company called CereProc, which custom-tailors [[text-to-speech]] software for voiceless customers who record their voices at length before losing them, and mined tapes and DVD commentaries featuring Ebert to create a voice that sounds more like his own voice.<ref name=Esquire/> He used the voice they devised for him in his March 2, 2010 appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'',<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100226/PEOPLE/100229986 Ebert, Roger.
