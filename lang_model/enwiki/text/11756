{{nihongo|'''Emperor Meiji'''|<U+660E><U+6CBB><U+5929><U+7687>|Meiji-tenn<U+014D>|extra= November 3, 1852 <U+2013> July 30, 1912}}, or {{nihongo|'''Meiji the Great'''|<U+660E><U+6CBB><U+5927><U+5E1D>|Meiji-taitei}}, was the 122nd [[Emperor of Japan]] according to the [[List of Japanese monarchs|traditional order of succession]], reigning from February 3, 1867 until his death on July 30, 1912.  He presided over a time of rapid change in the [[Empire of Japan]], as the nation quickly changed from a [[Feudalism|feudal]] state to a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and imperial [[Great power|world power]], characterized by Japan's [[industrial revolution]].

At the time of his birth in 1852, Japan was an isolated, [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]], [[feudalism|feudal]] country dominated by the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] and the [[daimyo]], who ruled over the country's more than 250 decentralized [[Han (Japan)|domains]]. By the time of his death in 1912, Japan had undergone a political, social, and industrial revolution at home (See ''[[Meiji Restoration]]'') and emerged as one of the [[great power]]s on the world stage. The ''[[New York Times]]'' summed up this  transformation at his funeral in 1912, with the words: "the contrast between that which preceded the funeral car and that which followed it was striking indeed.  Before it went old Japan; after it came new Japan."<ref name="nyt1912">http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D05E3DB1F3CE633A25750C1A9669D946396D6CF  "The Funeral Ceremonies of Meiji Tenno" reprinted from the ''Japan Advertiser'' [Article 8<U+2014>No Title&#93;,] ''New York Times.''  October 13, 1912.</ref>

During his lifetime, the emperor was known by his personal name {{nihongo|'''Mutsuhito'''|<U+7766><U+4EC1>}}. But upon his death he was given the reign name, Meiji. His personal name is never used in Japan in any official context. As the reigning emperor is referred to as the "Emperor", all deceased emperors are referred to by their given reign name. The correct usage in Japanese is the "Meiji Emperor".

==Background==
The [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] had established itself in the early 17th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|1995|p=vii.}}</ref>  Under its rule, the [[shogun]] governed Japan.  About 180&nbsp;lords, known as ''[[daimyo]]'', ruled [[han (administrative division)|autonomous realms]] under the shogun, who occasionally called upon the ''daimyo'' for gifts, but did not tax them.  The shogun controlled the ''daimyo'' in other ways; only the shogun could approve their marriages, and the shogun could divest a ''daimyo'' of his lands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=14<U+2013>15.}}</ref>

In 1615, the first Tokugawa shogun, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], who had officially retired from his position, and his son [[Tokugawa Hidetada]], the titular shogun, issued a code of behavior for the nobility.  Under it, the emperor was required to devote his time to scholarship and the arts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=3.}}</ref>  The emperors under the shogunate appear to have closely adhered to this code, studying Confucian classics and devoting time to poetry and calligraphy.<ref name = "ed">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=3<U+2013>4.}}</ref>  They were only taught the rudiments of Japanese and Chinese history and geography.<ref name = "ed"/>  The shogun did not seek the consent or advice of the emperor for his actions.<ref name = "live"/>

Emperors almost never left their palace compound, or ''[[Kyoto Imperial Palace|Gosho]]'' in [[Kyoto]], except after an emperor retired or to take shelter in a temple if the palace caught on fire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=4<U+2013>5.}}</ref>  Few emperors lived long enough to retire; of the Meiji Emperor's five predecessors, only his grandfather lived into his forties, dying aged forty-six.<ref name="live">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=2.}}</ref>  The imperial family suffered very high rates of infant mortality; all five of the emperor's brothers and sisters died as infants, and only five of his own fifteen children reached adulthood.<ref name = "live"/>

Soon after taking control in the early seventeenth century, shogunate officials (known generically as ''bakufu'') ended much Western trade with Japan, and barred missionaries from the islands.  In addition to the substantial Chinese trade, only the Dutch continued trade with Japan, maintaining a post on the island of [[Dejima]] by [[Nagasaki]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=19.}}</ref>  However, by the early 19th century, European and American vessels appeared in the waters around Japan with increasing frequency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=47.}}</ref>

==Boyhood==
Mutsuhito was born on November 3, 1852 in a small house on his maternal grandfather's properity at the north end of the ''Gosho''. At the time, a birth was believed to be polluting, so imperial princes were not born in the Palace, but usually in a structure, often temporary, near the pregnant woman's father's house. The boy's mother, [[Nakayama Yoshiko]] was a concubine (''gon no tenji'') to [[Emperor K<U+014D>mei]] and the daughter of the acting major counselor, [[Nakayama Tadayasu]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=10.}}</ref>  The young prince was given the name Sachinomiya, or Prince Sachi.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=14.}}</ref>

[[File:Teenager Meiji Emperor with foreign representatives 1868 1870.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Teenager Meiji Emperor with foreign representatives at the end of the [[Boshin War]], 1868<U+2013>1870.]]
The young prince was born at a time of change for Japan. This change was symbolized dramatically when Commodore [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Matthew Perry]] and his squadron of what the Japanese dubbed "the [[Black Ships]]", sailed into [[Tokyo Bay|the harbor]] at [[Edo]] (known since 1868 as Tokyo) in July 1853. Perry sought to open Japan to trade, and warned the Japanese of military consequences if they did not agree.<ref name = "uneq"/> During the crisis brought on by Perry's arrival, the ''bakufu'' took the highly unusual step of consulting with the Imperial Court, and Emperor K<U+014D>mei's officials advised that they felt the Americans should be allowed to trade and asked that they be informed in advance of any steps to be taken upon Perry's return. This request was initially honored by the ''bakufu'', and for the first time in at least 250 years, they consulted with the Imperial Court before making a decision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=18.}}</ref> Feeling that it could not win a war, the Japanese government allowed trade and submitted to what it dubbed the "[[Unequal Treaties]]", giving up tariff authority and the right to try foreigners in its own courts.<ref name = "uneq">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=50<U+2013>51.}}</ref> The ''bakufu's'' willingness to consult with the Court was short-lived: in 1858, word of [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States<U+2013>Japan)|a treaty]] arrived with a letter stating that due to shortness of time, it had not been possible to consult. Emperor K<U+014D>mei was so incensed that he threatened to abdicate<U+2014>though even this action would have required the consent of the shogun.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=39<U+2013>41.}}</ref>

Much of the Emperor's boyhood is known only through later accounts, which his biographer Donald Keene points out are often contradictory. One contemporary described the young prince as healthy and strong, somewhat of a bully and exceptionally talented at [[sumo]]. Another states that the prince was delicate and often ill. Some biographers state that he fainted when he first heard gunfire, while others deny this account.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=xii.}}</ref> On August 16, 1860, Sachinomiya was proclaimed prince of the blood and heir to the throne, and was formally adopted by [[Empress Eish<U+014D>|his father's consort]]. Later that year on November 11, he was proclaimed as the crown prince and given an adult name, Mutsuhito.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=51<U+2013>52.}}</ref> The prince began his education at the age of seven.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=46.}}</ref> He proved an indifferent student, and later in life wrote poems regretting that he had not applied himself more in writing practice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=48.}}</ref>

==Unrest and accession==

By the early 1860s, the shogunate was under several threats.  Representatives of foreign powers sought to increase their influence in Japan.  Many daimyo were increasingly dissatisfied with ''bakufu'' handling foreign affairs.  Large numbers of young [[samurai]], known as ''[[shishi (organization)|shishi]]'' or "men of high purpose" began to meet and speak against the shogunate.  The ''shishi'' revered the Emperor K<U+014D>mei and favored direct violent action to cure societal ills.  While they initially desired the death or expulsion of all foreigners, the ''shishi'' would later prove more pragmatic, and begin to advocate the modernization of the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=53<U+2013>55.}}</ref>  The ''bakufu'' enacted several measures to appease the various groups, and hoped to drive a wedge between the ''shishi'' and ''daimyo''.<ref name = "unrest">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=55<U+2013>56.}}</ref>

Kyoto was a major center for the ''shishi'', who had influence over the Emperor K<U+014D>mei.  In 1863, they persuaded him to issue an "[[Order to expel barbarians]]".  The Order placed the shogunate in a difficult position, since it knew it lacked the power to carry it out.  Several attacks were made on foreigners or their ships, and foreign forces retaliated.  ''Bakufu'' forces were able to drive most of the ''shishi'' out of Kyoto, and an attempt by them to return in 1864 was driven back.  Neverless, unrest continued throughout Japan.<ref name = "unrest"/>

[[File:Tokugawa yoshinobu.jpg|right|thumb|The shogun, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], in 1867.]]

The prince's awareness of the political turmoil is uncertain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=73.}}</ref>  During this time, he studied ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' poetry, first with his father, then with the court poets.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=78.}}</ref>  As the prince continued his classical education in 1866, a new shogun, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] took office, a reformer who desired to transform Japan into a Western-style state.  Yoshinobu, who would prove to be the final shogun, met with resistance from among the ''bakufu'', even as unrest and military actions continued.  In mid-1866, a ''bakufu'' army set forth to punish rebels in southern Japan.  The army was defeated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|pp=57<U+2013>58.}}</ref>

The Emperor K<U+014D>mei had always enjoyed excellent health, and was only 36&nbsp;years old in January 1867.  In that month, however, he fell seriously ill.  Though he appeared to make some recovery, he suddenly worsened and died on January 30.  Many historians believe the Emperor K<U+014D>mei was poisoned, a view not unknown at the time:  British diplomat Sir [[Ernest Satow]] wrote, "it is impossible to deny that <nowiki>[the Emperor K<U+014D>mei's]</nowiki> disappearance from the political scene, leaving as his successor a boy of fifteen or sixteen <nowiki>[actually fourteen]</nowiki>, was most opportune".<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=94<U+2013>96.}}</ref>

The crown prince formally ascended to the throne on February 3, 1867, in a brief ceremony in Kyoto.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=98.}}</ref>  The new Emperor continued his classical education, which did not include matters of politics.  In the meantime, the shogun, Yoshinobu, struggled to maintain power.  He repeatedly asked for the Emperor's confirmation of his actions, which he eventually received, but there is no indication that the young Emperor was himself involved in the decisions.  The ''shishi'' and other rebels continued to shape their vision of the new Japan, and while they revered the Emperor, they had no thought of having him play an active part in the political process.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=102<U+2013>104.}}</ref>

The political struggle reached its climax in late 1867.  In November, an agreement was reached by which Yoshinobu would maintain his title and some of his power, but the lawmaking power would be vested in a bicameral legislature based on the British model.  The following month, the agreement fell apart as the rebels marched on Kyoto, taking control of the Imperial Palace.<ref name = "out"/>  On January 4, 1868, the Emperor ceremoniously read out a document before the court proclaiming the "restoration" of Imperial rule,<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=121.}}</ref> and the following month, documents were sent to foreign powers:<ref name = "out"/>

<blockquote>The Emperor of Japan announces to the sovereigns of all foreign countries and to their subjects that permission has been granted to the Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu to return the governing power in accordance with his own request. We shall henceforward exercise supreme authority in all the internal and external affairs of the country. Consequently the title of Emperor must be substituted for that of [[Taikun|Tycoon]], in which the treaties have been made. Officers are being appointed by us to the conduct of foreign affairs. It is desirable that the representatives of the treaty powers recognize this announcement.<br>Mutsuhito<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=117.}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Yoshinobu [[Battle of Toba-Fushimi|resisted only briefly]], but it was not until late 1869 that the final ''bakufu'' holdouts [[Boshin War|were finally defeated]].<ref name = "out">{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=59.}}</ref>
In the ninth month of the following year, the [[Japanese era name|era]] was changed to Meiji, or <U+201C>enlightened rule<U+201D>, which was later used for the emperor's posthumous name. This marked the beginning of the custom of an era coinciding with an emperor's reign, and posthumously naming the emperor after the era during which he ruled.

Soon after his accession, the Emperor's officials presented [[Empress Sh<U+014D>ken|Ichij<U+014D> Haruko]] to him as a possible bride.  The future Empress was the daughter of an Imperial official, and was three years older than the groom, who would have to wait to wed until after his ''[[gembuku]]'' (manhood ceremony).  The two married on January 11, 1869.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=105<U+2013>107.}}</ref>  Known posthumously as [[Empress Sh<U+014D>ken]], she was the first Imperial Consort to receive the title of ''k<U+014D>g<U+014D>'' (literally, the Emperor's wife, translated as Empress [[Queen consort|Consort]]), in several hundred years. Although she was the first Japanese Empress Consort to play a public role, she bore no children. However, the Meiji emperor had fifteen children by five official ladies-in-waiting. Only five of his children, a prince born to [[Yanagihara Naruko|Lady Naruko]] (1855<U+2013>1943), the daughter of Yanagiwara Mitsunaru, and four princesses born to Lady Sachiko (1867<U+2013>1947), the eldest daughter of [[Count]] Sono Motosachi, lived to adulthood. They were:

===Consolidation of power===
[[File:MeijiJoukyou.jpg|thumb|Sixteen year old emperor, traveling from [[Kyoto]] to Tokyo at the end of 1868]]
Despite the ouster of the ''bakufu'', no effective central government had been put in place by the rebels. 
On March 23, foreign envoys were first permitted to visit Kyoto and pay formal calls on the Emperor<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=133.}}</ref>  On April 7, 1868, the Emperor was presented with the [[Five Charter Oath|Charter Oath]], a five-point statement of the nature of the new government, designed to win over those who had not yet committed themselves to the new regime.  This document, which the Emperor then formally promulgated, abolished [[feudalism]] and proclaimed a modern democratic government for Japan.  The Charter Oath would later be cited by [[Emperor Hirohito]] in the [[Humanity Declaration]] as support for the imposed changes in Japanese government following World War II.<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|1995|p=195.}}</ref>  In mid-May, he left the Imperial precincts in Kyoto for the first time since early childhood to take command of the forces pursuing the remnants of the ''bakufu'' armies.  Traveling in slow stages, he took three days to travel from Kyoto to Osaka, through roads lined with crowds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=143.}}</ref>  There was no conflict in Osaka; the new leaders wanted the Emperor to be more visible to his people and to foreign envoys.  At the end of May, after two weeks in Osaka (in a much less formal atmosphere than in Kyoto), the Emperor returned to his home.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=145<U+2013>146.}}</ref>  Shortly after his return, it was announced that the Emperor would begin to preside over all state business, reserving further literary study for his leisure time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=147.}}</ref>  Only from 1871 did the Emperor's studies include materials on contemporary affairs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=171.}}</ref>

[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|left|The Meiji Emperor in his younger years (illustration, not a photograph)]]

On September 19, 1868, the Emperor announced that the name of the city of Edo was being changed to Tokyo, or "eastern capital".  He was formally crowned in Kyoto on October 15 (a ceremony which had been postponed from the previous year due to the unrest).  Shortly before the coronation, he announced that the new era, or ''[[neng<U+014D>]]'', would be called ''Meiji'' or "enlightened rule".  Heretofore the ''neng<U+014D>'' had often been changed multiple times in an emperor's reign; from now on, it was announced, there would only be one ''neng<U+014D>'' per reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=157<U+2013>159.}}
</ref>

Soon after his coronation, the Emperor journeyed to Tokyo [[T<U+014D>kaid<U+014D> (road)|by road]], visiting it for the first time.  He arrived in late November, and began an extended stay by distributing [[sake]] among the population.  The population of Tokyo was eager for an Imperial visit; it had been the site of the Shogun's court and the population feared that with the abolition of the shogunate, the city might fall into decline.<ref>
{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=160<U+2013>163.}}</ref>  It would not be until 1889 that a final decision was made to move the capital to Tokyo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=68.}}</ref>  While in Tokyo, the Emperor boarded a Japanese naval vessel for the first time, and the following day gave instructions for studies to see how Japan's navy could be strengthened.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|pp=163<U+2013>165.}}</ref>  Soon after his return to Kyoto, a [[rescript]] was issued in the Emperor's name (but most likely written by court officials).  It indicated his intent to be involved in government affairs, and indeed he attended cabinet meetings and innumerable other government functions, though rarely speaking, almost until the day of his death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keene|2002|p=168.}}</ref>

===Political reform===
The successful revolutionaries organized themselves into a Council of State, and subsequently into a system where three main ministers led the government.  This structure would last until the establishment of a prime minister, who would lead a cabinet in the western fashion, in 1885.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=64.}}</ref>  Initially, not even the retention of the emperor was certain; revolutionary leader [[Got<U+014D> Sh<U+014D>jir<U+014D>]] later stated that some officials "were afraid the extremists might go further and abolish the Mikado".<ref>{{Harvnb|Jansen|1994|p=342.}}
</ref>

Japan's new leaders sought to reform the patchwork system of domains governed by the ''daimyo''.  In 1869, several of the ''daimyo'' who had supported the revolution gave their lands to the Emperor and were reappointed as governors, with considerable salaries.  By the following year, all other ''daimyo'' had followed suit.
  
[[File:Y<U+014D>sh<U+016B> Chikanobu Scene of the Diet.jpg|thumb|right|The Emperor in a formal session of the Diet.  [[Ukiyo-e]] woodblock print by [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Y<U+014D>sh<U+016B> Chikanobu]], 1890]]
[[File:Y<U+014D>sh<U+016B> Chikanobu House of Peers.jpg|thumb|right|The Emperor in a formal session of the House of Peers. Woodblock print by Chikanobu, 1890]]
In 1871, the Emperor announced that domains [[abolition of the han system|were entirely abolished]], as Japan was organized into 72 [[prefectures of Japan|prefectures]].  The ''daimyo'' were compensated with annual salaries equal to ten percent of their former revenues (from which they did not now have to deduct the cost of governing), but were required to move to the new capital, Tokyo.  Most retired from politics.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=63.}}</ref>

The new administration gradually abolished most privileges of the samurai, including their right to a stipend from the government.  However, unlike the ''daimyo'', many samurai suffered financially from this change.  Most other class-based distinctions were abolished.  Legalized discrimination against the ''[[burakumin]]'' ended.  However, these classes continue to suffer discrimination in Japan to the present time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gordon|2009|p=65.}}</ref>

Although a [[Diet of Japan|parliament]] was formed, it had no real power, and neither did the emperor. Power had passed from the Tokugawa into the hands of those Daimyo and other samurai who had led the Restoration. Japan was thus controlled by the ''[[Genro]],'' an [[oligarchy]], which comprised the most powerful men of the military, political, and economic spheres. The emperor, if nothing else, showed greater political longevity than his recent predecessors, as he was the first Japanese monarch to remain on the throne past the age of 50 since the abdication of [[Emperor <U+014C>gimachi]] in 1586.

The Japanese take pride in the Meiji Restoration, as it and the accompanying industrialization allowed Japan to become the preeminent power in the Pacific and a major player in the world within a [[generation]]. Yet, the Meiji emperor's role in the Restoration remains debatable. He certainly did not control Japan, but how much influence he wielded is unknown.

One of the few windows we have into the Emperor's own feelings is his poetry, which seems to indicate a [[pacifism|pacifist]] streak, or at least a man who wished war could be avoided. He composed the following pacifist poem:
