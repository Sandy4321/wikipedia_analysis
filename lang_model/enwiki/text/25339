'''Edvard Sylou-Creutz''' (7 May 1881 &ndash; 11 May 1945) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] classical pianist, composer and radio personality, who was especially active in [[Nazi]]-controlled radio in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]] between March 1940 and the autumn of 1942.

==Pre-World War II career==
He studied with [[Agathe Backer-Gr<U+00F8>ndahl]] and also several years abroad. He made his concert debut in 1910, and was a music critic for the newspaper ''[[Morgenbladet]]'' from 1919.<ref name=ml>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sylou-Kreutz, Edvard |encyclopedia=Musikkleksikon |language=Norwegian |editor=[[<U+00D8>yvind Anker|Anker, <U+00D8>yvind]]; [[Olav Gurvin|Gurvin, Olav]] |publisher=Dreyers forlag |location=Oslo |year=1949 |page=1171}}</ref> In 1910 he and Signe Jonson had a son, Bj<U+00F8>rn, who like his father entered a musical career, before changing his mind and eventually becoming a medical doctor.<ref>{{cite book|last=M<U+00F8>ller |first=Tryggve Juul |authorlink= |title=Studentene fra 1930: biografiske opplysninger, statistikk og artikler samlet til 25 <U+00E5>rs jubileet 1955 |publisher=Bokkomiteen for studentene fra 1930 |location=Oslo |year=1955 |page=359 |isbn=|url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2011112808082 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Before World War II he worked as a pianist and composer.<ref name=p113>{{cite book|last=Dahl|first=Hans Fredrik|authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl|title="Dette er London".

==Wartime collaboration==
Sylou-Creutz was a member of the Fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]]. In March 1940 he applied for a job in radio broadcasts from Germany to Norway, and he was hired as program presenter and news reader. These broadcasts were propagandistic, and started on 1 April 1940, having been preceded by German broadcasts to [[Sweden]] from 20 November 1939 and to [[Denmark]] from January 1940.<ref name=p113/> Sylou-Creutz worked anonymously in this job.<ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 129</ref>

Syloud-Creutz continued his broadcasts after the [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|German invasion of Norway]] on 9 April 1940.<ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 128</ref> In the second half of April, the broadcasts switched from conveying German views on Norway (and often omitting Norway altogether, in favor of other war news) to being responses to British propaganda news.<ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 130</ref> This shift was especially caused by the speech made by [[J. H. Marshall-Cornwall]] on 13 April, which called for Norwegian sabotage against the Germans. Sylou-Creutz also lamented the absence of German-friendly [[Victor Mogens]] as a foreign news commentator in Norwegian radio.<ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 131</ref> Mogens had been pressured to resign in 1936.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Victor Mogens|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Arnljot Str<U+00F8>mme|last=Svendsen|authorlink=Arnljot Str<U+00F8>mme Svendsen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Victor_Mogens/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>

By late April and early May 1940, preparations were made to close the German-based broadcasts to Norway, and instead make use of the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]. Sylou-Creutz moved to Norway in early June after his last broadcast on German soil, and continued his career in Norway.<ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 133</ref> Via contacts in the ''[[Reichskommissariat Norwegen]]'' (which was the highest authority over the Broadcasting Corporation), Sylou-Creutz also managed to see his music get a lot of airtime.<ref name=p186/>

On 28 September 1940, the Nazis took more control over the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation; the pre-war director [[Olav Midttun]] was fired, and Edvard Sylou-Creutz and [[Eyvind Mehle]] were installed as program directors.<ref>Dahl, 1978: pp. 289<U+2013>290</ref> Sylou-Creutz was also responsible for music.<ref name=p186>Dahl, 1978: p. 186</ref> While being program directors, Mehle and Sylou-Creutz were subordinates of commissary president [[Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie (Nazi)|Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie]].<ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 294</ref> There was a considerable rivalry and antagonism between Christie and Mehle, Christie and administrative director [[Carl B<U+00F8>dtker]], and to a lesser degree between Mehle and Sylou-Creutz.<ref name=p294>Dahl, 1978: pp. 294<U+2013>297</ref> Among others, Mehle and Sylou-Creutz bickered over the right to the largest office.<ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 307</ref> More importantly however, Mehle and Sylou-Creutz were on the same side in that they were German-friendly.<ref name=p294/> In 1940 Sylou-Creutz made announcements stating that [[Jewish music]] should be banned from Norwegian airwaves and all performers should also be members of Nasjonal Samling.<ref>{{cite book|last=Braham |first=Randolph L. |authorlink=Randolph L.

Sylou-Creutz, having failed in his attempt at making performing in the radio a legal obligation for Norwegian artists, on 27 August 1942 banned six artists belonging to the concert company ''Br<U+00F8>drene Hals' Konsertbyr<U+00E5>'' from renting the Aulaen Hall of the University of Oslo. The artists banned were [[Robert Riefling]], [[Jan W<U+00F8>lner]], [[Frithjof Backer-Gr<U+00F8>ndahl]], [[Amalie Christie]], [[Rolf St<U+00F8>rseth]] and [[Kari Glaser]]. The ban attracted great controversy, with the national music consultant [[Geirr Tveitt]] resigning in an 18-page protest letter to minister [[Gulbrand Lunde]]. Tveitt called Sylou-Creutz' actions "... madness... for it can lead to nothing but the destruction of all musical life."<ref group="quote">{{lang-no|...galskap... for det kan ikke annet enn f<U+00F8>re til <U+00F8>deleggelse av alt musikkliv.}} Voks<U+00F8> 1994: p. 260</ref>
The ban was reversed on 26 September 1942.<ref>{{cite book|last=Voks<U+00F8> |first=Per |authorlink=Per Voks<U+00F8> |author2=Berg, John |title=Krigens dagbok - Norge 1940-1945 |publisher=Forlaget Det Beste |location=Oslo |year=1994 |page=260 |isbn=82-7010-166-4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Storaas |first=Reidar |authorlink= |title=Tonediktaren Geirr Tveitt : songjen i fossaduren |publisher=Samlaget  |location=Oslo |year=1990 |page=140 |isbn=82-521-3555-2|url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007092601019 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Amidst towering intrigue, Sylou-Creutz was let go from the Broadcasting Corporation on 28 October 1942.<ref>{{cite book |title=Meldungen aus Norwegen 1940-1945: Die geheimen Lageberichte des Befehlshabers der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD in Norwegen |last=Larsen |first=Stein Ugelvik |authorlink= |coauthors=Beatrice Sandberg, Volker Dahm, Sicherheitspolizei |year=2008|publisher=Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag |location= |isbn=3-486-55891-9 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sOfmXQLKst4C&pg=PA894&dq=Sylou-Creutz&as_brr=3&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Sylou-Creutz&f=false |language=German |page=894}}</ref><ref>Dahl, 1978: p. 298</ref>

In connection with the 100th anniversary of the birth of the famous Norwegian composer [[Edvard Grieg]] on 15 June 1943 Sylou-Creutz was to hold the official Grieg concert in [[Stavanger]]. The city's orchestra had been offered {{NOK|10-15,000}} in public funds to perform with him, but declined. Sylou-Creutz ended up playing alone for an audience of 48 people, 40 of whom had been given free tickets. The paying members of the audience were asked to move from the gallery to the front benches. In comparison non-Nazi artist [[Ivar Johnsen]] performed a single piece of Grieg's music in the park Forn<U+00F8>yelsesparken in Stavanger in storming rain with an audience of between 1,000 and 2,000 people the same day.<ref>Voks<U+00F8> 1994: p. 338</ref> At yet another concert, organized by the Norwegian-German Society in [[Larvik]] on 23 November 1943, almost no audience attended the concert hall. Sylou-Creutz performed works by Grieg, [[Franz Schubert]], [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]], as well several of his own compositions. The Nazi-censured newspaper ''[[Larvik Dagblad]]'' stated at the time that it was to Sylou-Creutz's credit "both as a human being and an artist" to be able to perform "under these circumstances".<ref>{{cite book|last=Nyhus |first=Per |authorlink= |title=Krigs<U+00E5>r i Larvik-distriktet |publisher=Forl. for historie, Langs L<U+00E5>gen |location=Kongberg |year=1990 |page=144 |isbn=|url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010120120016 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>
