'''Compton''' is a historic home in [[Trappe, Maryland|Trappe]], [[Talbot County, Maryland]].  It is a two-part [[Flemish bond]] brick dwelling, which is the result of two major building periods and subsequent minor alterations. The main part is five bays long with a three-brick belt course between floors.  The second part is a one and a half story kitchen / dining room wing.  Also on the property is a two-story brick [[milkhouse]].
