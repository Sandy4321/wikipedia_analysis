In [[signal processing]], the '''Nyquist rate''' is two times the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a [[bandlimited]] signal or a bandlimited channel. This term is used to mean two different things under two different circumstances:

==Nyquist rate relative to sampling==
The Nyquist rate is the minimum [[sampling frequency|sampling rate]] required to avoid [[aliasing]], equal to twice the highest frequency contained within the signal.

:<math>f_N \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   2 B\,</math>

where <math>B\,</math> is the highest [[frequency]] at which the signal can have nonzero energy.  

To avoid aliasing, the sampling rate must exceed the Nyquist rate:

:<math>f_S > f_N.\,</math>

To avoid aliasing, the bandwidth must be considered to be the upper frequency limit of a [[baseband]] signal. [[Sampling (signal_processing)#IF/RF (bandpass) sampling|Bandpass sampling]] signals must be sampled at least twice the frequency of the highest frequency component of the bandpass signal in order to avoid aliasing.  However, it is typical to use aliasing to advantage, to allow sampling of bandpass signals at rates as low as B, where B is the bandwidth of the bandpass signal.  An alternative is to mix ([[heterodyne]]) the bandpass signals down to baseband, and sample there in the usual way; in this case, the baseband bandwidth can be as low as B/2 in the case of symmetric signals such as [[amplitude modulation]], so the sampling rate can be as low as B in such cases.

==Nyquist rate relative to signaling==

Long before [[Harry Nyquist]] had his name associated with sampling, the term ''Nyquist rate'' was used differently, with a meaning closer to what Nyquist actually studied.  Quoting [[Harold Stephen Black|Harold S. Black's]] 1953 book ''Modulation Theory,'' in the section '''''Nyquist Interval''''' of the opening chapter ''Historical Background:''

:"If the essential frequency range is limited to ''B'' cycles per second, 2''B'' was given by Nyquist as the maximum number of code elements per second that could be unambiguously resolved, assuming the peak interference is less half a quantum step.  This rate is generally referred to as '''signaling at the Nyquist rate''' and 1/(2''B'') has been termed a ''Nyquist interval''." (bold added for emphasis; italics as in the original)

According to the [[OED]], this may be the origin of the term ''Nyquist rate''.<ref>[[Harold Stephen Black|Black, H. S.]], ''Modulation Theory'', v. 65, 1953, cited in [[OED]]</ref>

Nyquist's famous 1928 paper was a study on how many pulses (code elements) could be transmitted per second, and recovered, through a channel of limited bandwidth.  ''Signaling at the Nyquist rate'' meant putting as many code pulses through a telegraph channel as its bandwidth would allow.  Shannon used Nyquist's approach when he proved the [[sampling theorem]] in 1948, but Nyquist did not work on sampling per se.

Black's later chapter on "The Sampling Principle" does give Nyquist some of the credit for some relevant math:

:"Nyquist (1928) pointed out that, if the function is substantially limited to the time interval ''T'', 2''BT'' values are sufficient to specify the function, basing his conclusions on a Fourier series representation of the function over the time interval ''T''."
