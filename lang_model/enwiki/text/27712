==History==
There are very few texts specifically dealing with the role of women;<ref>Shweta Singh (2009). Examining the Dharma Driven Identity of Women: Mahabharata<U+2019>s Kunti - In The Woman Question in the Contemporary Indian English Women Writings, Ed. Indu Swami, Sarup: Delhi.</ref> an important exception is the 
''strIdharmapaddhati'' of Tryambakayajvan, an official at [[Thanjavur]] around c.1730.  The text compiles strictures on womenly behaviour dating back to the [[Apastamba]] sutra (c. 4th c. BCE).<ref>
The perfect wife: ''strIdharmapaddhati'' (guide to the duties of women) by Tryambakayajvan (trans. Julia Leslie ), Penguin 1995 ISBN 0-14-043598-0.</ref>  The opening verse goes: 
: ''mukhyo dharmaH smr^tiShu vihito bhartr^shushruShANam hi'' :
: women are enjoined to be of service to their husbands.
where the term ''shushruShA'' (lit. "desire to hear") covers a range of meanings from
the devotee's homage to god, or the obsequious service of a slave.<ref>see extensive excerpts from ''strIdharmapaddhati'' at http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/~amit/books/tryambakayajvan-1989-perfect-wife-stridharmapaddhati.html</ref>

Some kingdoms in the ancient India had traditions such as ''[[nagarvadhu]]'' ("bride of the city"). Women competed to win the coveted title of the ''nagarvadhu''. [[Ambapali|Amrapali]] is the most famous example of a nagarvadhu.

According to studies, women enjoyed equal status and rights during the early [[Vedic period]].<ref name="infochange_women">{{cite web

===Medieval period===
[[Image:Pastimes15.jpg|thumb|right|Krishna at [[Radha|Goddesss Radharani's]] feet]]
The Indian woman's position in the society further deteriorated during the medieval period<ref name="nrcw_history"/><ref name="vedam_towards_gender"/> when [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] among some communities, [[child marriages]] and a ban on widow remarriages became part of social life among some communities in India. The [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] brought the [[purdah]] practice in the Indian society. Among the [[Rajput]]s of Rajasthan, the [[Jauhar]] was practised. In some parts of India, the [[Devadasi]]s or the temple women were sexually exploited. Polygamy was widely practised especially among Hindu Kshatriya rulers.<ref name="kamat_medieval_karnataka"/> In many Muslim families, women were restricted to [[Zenana]] areas.

In spite of these conditions, some women excelled in the fields of politics, literature, education and religion.<ref name="nrcw_history"/> [[Razia Sultana]] became the only woman monarch to have ever ruled [[Delhi]]. The [[Gondi people|Gond]] queen [[Durgavati]] ruled for fifteen years, before she lost her life in a battle with Mughal emperor [[Akbar]]'s general Asaf Khan in 1564. [[Chand Bibi]] defended [[Ahmednagar Sultanate|Ahmednagar]] against the mighty [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] forces of Akbar in 1590s. [[Jehangir]]'s wife [[Nur Jehan]] effectively wielded imperial power and was recognized as the real force behind the Mughal throne. The Mughal princesses Jahanara and Zebunnissa were well-known poets, and also influenced the ruling administration [[Shivaji]]'s mother, [[Jijabai]] was deputed as queen regent, because of her ability as a warrior and an administrator. In South India, many women administered villages, towns, divisions and heralded social and religious institutions.<ref name="kamat_medieval_karnataka"/>

The [[Bhakti]] movements tried to restore women's status and questioned some of the forms of oppression.<ref name="infochange_women"/> [[Mirabai]], a female saint-poet, was one of the most important Bhakti movement figures. Some other female saint-poets from this period include [[Akka Mahadevi]], Rami Janabai and [[Lal Ded]]. Bhakti sects within Hinduism such as the Mahanubhav, Varkari and many others were principle movements within the Hindu fold to openly advocate social justice and equality between men and women.

Shortly after the Bhakti movement, [[Guru Nanak]], the first Guru of [[Sikh]]s also preached the message of equality between men and women. He advocated that women be allowed to lead religious assemblies; to perform and lead congregational hymn singing called [[Kirtan]] or [[Bhajan]]; become members of religious management committees; to lead armies on the battlefield; have equality in marriage, and equality in [[Amrit]] (Baptism). Other [[Sikh Gurus]] also preached against the discrimination against women.

===Historical practices===

Traditions among some communities such as [[Sati (practice)|sati]], [[jauhar]], and [[devadasi]] have been banned and are largely defunct in modern India. However, some cases of these practices are still found in remote parts of India. The [[purdah]] is still practised by Indian women among some communities, and [[child marriage]] remains prevalent despite it being an illegal practice, especially under current Indian laws.

;[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]
:Sati is an old, largely defunct custom, among some communities in which the widow was immolated alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Although the act was supposed to be a voluntary on the widow's part, it is believed to have been sometimes forced on the widow. It was abolished by the British in 1829. There have been around forty reported cases of sati since independence.<ref name="tribune_fifty_feudal">{{cite web

;[[Jauhar]]
:Jauhar refers to the practice of the voluntary immolation of all the wives and daughters of defeated warriors, in order to avoid capture and consequent molestation by the enemy. The practice was followed by the wives of defeated [[Rajput]] rulers, who are known to place a high premium on honour.

;[[Purdah]]
:Purdah is the practice among some communities of requiring women to cover their bodies so as to cover their skin and conceal their form. It imposes restrictions on the mobility of women, it curtails their right to interact freely and it is a symbol of the subordination of women. It does not reflect the religious teachings of either Hinduism or Islam, contrary to common belief, although misconception has occurred due to the ignorance and prejudices of religious leaders of both faiths.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

;[[Devadasi]]s
:Devadasi is a religious practice in some parts of southern India, in which women are "married" to a deity or temple. The ritual was well established by the 10th century A.D.<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate=2006-12-25
}}</ref> In the later period, the illegitimate sexual exploitation of the devadasi's became a norm in some parts of India.

===British rule===
European scholars observed in the 19th century that Hindu women are "naturally chaste" and "more virtuous" than other women.<ref>Dubois, Jean Antoine and Beauchamp, Henry King, Hindu manners, customs, and ceremonies, Clarendon press, 1897</ref> During the [[British Raj]], many reformers such as [[Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Jyotirao Phule]] etc. fought for the upliftment of women. [[Peary Charan Sarkar]], a former student of Hindu College, Calcutta and a member of "Young Bengal" set up the first free school for girls in India in 1847 in Barasat, a suburb of Calcutta (later the school was named Kalikrishna Girls' High School).

While this list might suggest that there was no positive British contribution during the Raj era, that is not entirely so, since missionaries' wives like Martha Mault n<U+00E9>e Mead and her daughter Eliza Caldwell n<U+00E9>e Mault are rightly remembered for pioneering the education and training of girls in south India - a practise that initially met with local resistance, as it flew in the face of tradition. Raja Rammohan Roy's efforts led to the abolition of the [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] practice under [[Governor-General]] [[Lord William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck|William Cavendish-Bentinck]] in 1829. Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's crusade for the improvement in condition of widows led to the [[Widow Remarriage Act]] of 1856. Many women reformers such as [[Pandita Ramabai]] also helped the cause of women upliftment.

[[Kittur Chennamma]], the queen of the princely state Kittur in Karnataka, led an armed rebellion against the British in response to the [[Doctrine of lapse]]. [[Abbakka Rani]] the queen of coastal Karnataka led the defence against invading European armies notably the Portuguese in 16th century. [[Rani Lakshmi Bai]], the Queen of [[Jhansi]], led the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] against the British. She is now widely considered as a nationalist hero. [[Begum Hazrat Mahal]], the co-ruler of [[Awadh]], was another ruler who led the revolt of 1857. She refused the deals with the British and later retreated to Nepal. The [[Begum of Bhopal|Begums of Bhopal]] were also few of the notable female rulers during this period. They did not observe [[purdah]] and were trained in [[martial art]]s.

[[Chandramukhi Basu]], [[Kadambini Ganguly]] and [[Anandi Gopal Joshi]] were few of the earliest Indian women to obtain educational degrees.

In 1917, the first women's delegation met the Secretary of State to demand women's political rights, supported by the Indian National Congress. The All India Women's Education Conference was held in Pune in 1927.<ref name="infochange_women"/> In 1929, the Child Marriage Restraint Act was passed, stipulating fourteen as the minimum age of marriage for a girl through the efforts of [[Mahomed Ali Jinnah]].<ref name="infochange_women"/><ref>Ambassador of Hindu Muslim Unity, Ian Bryant Wells</ref> Though Mahatma Gandhi himself married at the age of thirteen, he later urged people to boycott child marriages and called upon the young men to marry the child widows.<ref name="kamat_gandhi_status"/>

Women played an important part in India's independence struggle. Some of the famous freedom fighters include [[Bhikaji Cama]], Dr. [[Annie Besant]], [[Pritilata Waddedar]], [[Vijayalakshmi Pandit]], [[Rajkumari Amrit Kaur]], [[Aruna Asaf Ali]], [[Sucheta Kriplani]] and [[Kasturba Gandhi]]. Other notable names include [[Muthulakshmi Reddy]], [[Durgabai Deshmukh]] etc. The Rani of Jhansi Regiment of [[Subhash Chandra Bose]]'s [[Indian National Army]] consisted entirely of women including Captain [[Lakshmi Sahgal]]. [[Sarojini Naidu]], a poet and a [[freedom fighter]], was the first Indian woman to become the President of the [[Indian National Congress]] and the first woman to become the governor of a state in India.

The Constitution of India guarantees to all Indian women equality (Article 14), no discrimination by the State (Article 15(1)), equality of opportunity (Article 16), equal pay for equal work (Article 39(d)). In addition, it allows special provisions to be made by the State in favour of women and children (Article 15(3)), renounces practices derogatory to the dignity of women (Article 51(A) (e)), and also allows for provisions to be made by the State for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief.

The [[feminism in India|feminist activism in India]] picked up momentum during later 1970s. One of the first national level issues that brought the women's groups together was the [[Mathura rape case]]. The acquittal of policemen accused of raping a young girl Mathura in a police station, led to a wide-scale protests in 1979<U+2013>1980. The protests were widely covered in the national media, and forced the Government to amend the Evidence Act, the Criminal Procedure Code and the Indian Penal Code and introduce the category of custodial rape.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> Female activists united over issues such as female infanticide, gender bias, women health, and female literacy.

Self-help groups and NGOs such as [[SEWA|Self Employed Women's Association]] (SEWA) have played a major role in women's rights in India. Many women have emerged as leaders of local movements.

==Culture==

[[Sari]] (a single piece of a long cloth wound around the body) and [[salwar kameez]] are worn by women all over India. ''[[Bindi (decoration)|Bindi]]'' is part of the women's make-up. Unlike common belief, the bindi on the forehead does not signify marital status, however the [[Sindoor]] does.<ref>http://www.snopes.com/religion/reddot.asp</ref>

[[Rangoli]] (or Kolam) is a traditional art very popular among Indian women.

==Education and economic development==

According to 1992-93 figures, only 9.2% of the households in India were female-headed. However, approximately 35% of the households below the poverty line were found to be female-headed.<ref name="fao_sd_india">{{cite web

===Education===

Though it is gradually rising, the female literacy rate in India is lower than the male literacy rate.<ref>Singh, S. (2007).  Schooling Girls and the Gender and Development Paradigm: Quest for an Appropriate Framework for Women<U+2019>s Education. Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, 2(3), 1-12.</ref> Compared to boys, far fewer girls are enrolled in the schools, and many of them drop out.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> According to the National Sample Survey Data of 1997, only the states of [[Kerala]] and [[Mizoram]] have approached universal female literacy rates. According to majority of the scholars, the major factor behind the improved social and economic status of women in Kerala is literacy.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/>

Under Non-Formal Education programme (NFE), about 40% of the centres in states and 10% of the centres in [[Union Territory|UTs]] are exclusively [[reservation in India|reserved]] for females.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} As of 2000, about 0.3 million NFE centres were catering to about 7.42 million children, out of which about 0.12 million were exclusively for girls.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In urban India, girls are nearly at par with the boys in terms of education. However, in rural India girls continue to be less educated than the boys.

According to a 1998 report by U.S. Department of Commerce, the chief barrier to female education in India are inadequate school facilities (such as sanitary facilities), shortage of female teachers and gender bias in curriculum (majority of the female characters being depicted as weak and helpless).<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> The National data collection agencies accept the fact that there is a serious under-estimation of women's contribution as workers.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> However, there are far fewer women in the paid workforce than there are men. In urban India Women have impressive number in the workforce. As an example at software industry 30% of the workforce is female.<ref>Singh, S., & Hoge, G. (2010). Debating Outcomes for <U+2018>Working<U+2019> Women <U+2013> Illustration  from India, The Journal of Poverty, 14 (2), 197-215</ref> They are at par with their male counter parts in terms of wages, position at the work place.

In rural India, agriculture and allied industrial sectors employ as much as 89.5% of the total female labour.<ref name="fao_sd_india"/> In overall farm production, women's average contribution is estimated at 55% to 66% of the total labour. According to a 1991 World Bank report, women accounted for 94% of total employment in dairy production in India. Women constitute 51% of the total employed in forest-based small-scale enterprises.<ref name="fao_sd_india"/>

One of the most famous female business success stories is the [[Shri Mahila Griha Udyog Lijjat Papad]]. In 2006, [[Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw]], who started Biocon - one of India's first biotech companies, was rated India's richest woman. Lalita Gupte and Kalpana Morparia (both were the only businesswomen in India who made the list of the Forbes World's Most Powerful Women), run India's second-largest bank, [[ICICI Bank]].<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/2006/08/30/power-women-india_cz_mb_06women_0831india.html India's Most Powerful Businesswomen].

===Land and property rights===

In most Indian families , women do not own any property in their own names, and do not get a share of parental property.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> Due to weak enforcement of laws protecting them, women continue to have little access to land and property.<ref name="carol_chronic">{{cite web

}}</ref> In fact, some of the laws discriminate against women, when it comes to land and property rights.

The Hindu personal laws of mid-1956s (applied to Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains) gave women rights to inheritance. However, the sons had an independent share in the ancestral property, while the daughters' shares were based on the share received by their father. Hence, a father could effectively disinherit a daughter by renouncing his share of the ancestral property, but the son will continue to have a share in his own right. Additionally, married daughters, even those facing marital harassment, had no residential rights in the ancestral home. After amendment of Hindu laws in 2005, now women in have been provided the same status as that of men.<ref>[http://indiacode.nic.in/fullact1.asp?tfnm=200539 THE HINDU SUCCESSION (AMENDMENT) ACT, 2005]</ref>

In 1986, the Supreme Court of India ruled that [[Shah Bano case|Shah Bano]], an old divorced Muslim woman was eligible for maintenance money. However, the decision was vociferously opposed by fundamentalist Muslim leaders, who alleged that the court was interfering in their personal law. The [[Government of India|Union Government]] subsequently passed the Muslim Women's (Protection of Rights Upon Divorce) Act.<ref>{{cite web|title = The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act|url=http://www.sudhirlaw.com/themuslimwomen.htm|month=May | year=1986|accessdate=2008-02-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071227155728/http://www.sudhirlaw.com/themuslimwomen.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-27}}</ref>

Similarly, the Christian women have struggled over years for equal rights of divorce and succession. In 1994, all the churches, jointly with women's organisations, drew up a draft law called the Christian Marriage and Matrimonial Causes Bill. However, the government has still not amended the relevant laws.<ref name="infochange_women"/>

==Crimes against women==

Police records show high incidence of crimes against women in India. The National Crime Records Bureau reported in 1998 that the growth rate of crimes against women would be higher than the population growth rate by 2010.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> Earlier, many cases were not registered with the police due to the social stigma attached to [[List of rape cases in India|rape]] and molestation cases. Official statistics show that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of reported crimes against women.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/>

===Sexual harassment===
Half of the total number of crimes against women reported in 1990 related to molestation and harassment at the workplace.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> [[Eve teasing]] is a euphemism used for sexual harassment or molestation of women by men. Many activists blame the rising incidents of sexual harassment against women on the influence of "Western culture". In 1987, The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act was passed<ref>{{cite web
|title=The Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1987
|url=http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionrules.htm
|accessdate=2006-12-24
}}</ref> to prohibit indecent representation of women through advertisements or in publications, writings, paintings, figures or in any other manner.

In 1997, in a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court of India took a strong stand against sexual harassment of women in
the workplace. The Court also laid down detailed guidelines for prevention and redressal of grievances. The National Commission for Women subsequently elaborated these guidelines into a Code of Conduct for employers.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/>

===Dowry===
{{Main|Dowry|Dowry death|Dowry law in India}}

In 1961, the Government of India passed the Dowry Prohibition Act,<ref>{{cite web
|title=The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961
|url=http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionact.htm
|accessdate=2006-12-24
}}</ref> making the dowry demands in wedding arrangements illegal. However, many cases of dowry-related domestic violence, suicides and murders have been reported. In the 1980s, numerous such cases were reported.<ref name="kamat_faq"/>

In 1985, the Dowry Prohibition (maintenance of lists of presents to the bride and bridegroom) rules were framed.<ref>{{cite web
|title=The Dowry Prohibition (maintenance of lists of presents to the bride and bridegroom) rules, 1985
|url=http://www.wcd.nic.in/dowryprohibitionrules.htm
|accessdate=2006-12-24
}}</ref> According to these rules, a signed list of presents given at the time of the marriage to the bride and the bridegroom should be maintained. The list should contain a brief description of each present, its approximate value, the name of whoever has given the present and his/her relationship to the person. However, such rules are hardly enforced.

A 1997 report<ref>''Kitchen fires Kill Indian Brides with Inadequate Dowry'', July 23, 1997, New Delhi, UPI</ref> claimed that at least 5,000 women die each year because of dowry deaths, and at least a dozen die each day in 'kitchen fires' thought to be intentional. The term for this is "[[bride burning]]" and is criticized within India itself. Amongst the urban educated, such dowry abuse has reduced considerably.

===Child marriage===

[[Child marriage]] has been traditionally prevalent in India and continues to this day. Historically, young girls would live with their parents until they reached puberty. In the past, the child widows were condemned to a life of great agony, shaving heads, living in isolation, and shunned by the society.<ref name="kamat_gandhi_status">{{cite web

According to UNICEF<U+2019>s <U+201C>State of the World<U+2019>s Children-2009<U+201D> report, 47% of India's women aged 20<U+2013>24 were married before the legal age of 18, with 56% in rural areas.<ref>http://www.unicef.org/sowc09/docs/SOWC09_Table_9.pdf</ref> The report also showed that 40% of the world's child marriages occur in India.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/01/18/stories/2009011855981100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=40 p.c. child marriages in India: UNICEF | date=2009-01-18}}</ref>

===Female infanticides and sex selective abortions===
{{main|Sex-selective abortion and infanticide}}
India has a highly masculine sex ratio, the chief reason being that many women die before reaching adulthood.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> Tribal societies in India have a less masculine sex ratio than all other [[Indian caste system|caste]] groups. This, in spite of the fact that tribal communities have far lower levels of income, literacy and health facilities.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> It is therefore suggested by many experts, that the highly masculine sex ratio in India can be attributed to female infanticides and sex-selective abortions.

All medical tests that can be used to determine the sex of the child have been banned in India, due to incidents of these tests being used to get rid of unwanted female children before birth. Female infanticide (killing of girl infants) is still prevalent in some rural areas.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> The abuse of the dowry tradition has been one of the main reasons for sex-selective abortions and female infanticides in India.

===Domestic violence===

The incidents of domestic violence are higher among the lower Socio-Economic Classes (SECs).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 came into force on October 26, 2006.

===Trafficking===
The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act was passed in 1956.<ref>{{cite web
|title=The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956
|url=http://www.wcd.nic.in/act/itpa1956.htm
|accessdate=2006-12-24
}}</ref> However many cases of [[human trafficking|trafficking]] of young girls and women have been reported. These women are either forced into prostitution, domestic work or [[child labour]].

==Other concerns==

===Health===

The average female life expectancy today in India is low compared to many countries, but it has shown gradual improvement over the years. In many families, especially rural ones, the girls and women face nutritional discrimination within the family, and are anaemic and malnourished.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/>

The maternal mortality in India is the second highest in the world.<ref name="infochange_women"/> Only 42% of births in the country are supervised by health professionals. Most women deliver with help from women in the family who often lack the skills and resources to save the mother's life if it is in danger.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/> According to UNDP Human Development Report (1997), 88% of pregnant women (age 15-49) were found to be suffering from anaemia.<ref name="fao_sd_india"/>

===Family planning===

The average woman in rural areas of India has little or no control over her reproductivity.  Women, particularly women in rural areas, do not have access to safe and self-controlled methods of contraception. The public health system emphasises permanent methods like sterilisation, or long-term methods like IUDs that do not need follow-up. Sterilization accounts for more than 75% of total contraception, with female sterilisation accounting for almost 95% of all sterilisations.<ref name="un_women_free_equal"/>
