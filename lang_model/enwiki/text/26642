'''Svetlana Alexandrovna Chervonnaya''' (Russian: <U+0421><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+043B><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430> A<U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0427><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+043E><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F>, born 1948) is a [[historian]] living in [[Russia]] specializing in the [[politics|political history]] of the [[Cold War]] period and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[espionage]] activities in the [[United States of America]]. Along with [[Ellen Schrecker]], Chervonnaya is known as one of the leading scholarly voices arguing against post-Soviet American [[triumphalism]]. In the post-Soviet period, Chervonnaya has also established herself as an investigator and producer of documentary television shows seen in the United States, Germany, and Russia.

==Biography==
===Early years===

Svetlana Alexandrovna Chervonnaya was born in Moscow on October 14, 1948 of ethnic [[Jewish]] parents. During [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] times, with their [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] restrictions on permitted locations of Jewish residence, Chervonnaya's ancestors hailed from the [[Ukraine]], [[Poland]], and [[Belorussia]].<ref name="Story">Svetlana Chervonnaya, [http://www.documentstalk.com/wp/an-unfinished-story "An Unfinished Story,"] DocumentsTalk.com, Moscow.</ref>

Chervonnaya's father was an investigator in the Procurator General's Office in Moscow, part of the [[People's Commissariat of Justice]] headed by [[Andrei Vyshinsky]].<ref name="Story" /> He worked non-political cases including economic crimes, [[gang]] crimes, and [[homicide]] cases.<ref name="Story" /> By the time Svetlana started school, he had left the Procurator's office and became a [[criminal defense attorney]].<ref name="Story" />

A [[great uncle]] on Svetlana's mother's side, Efim Dreizer, was a victim of the [[Great Terror]] of the 1930s. He was arrested, confessed under duress, tried in the first Moscow show trial in 1936 and executed for purportedly participating in a criminal plot in the [[Red Army]] directed by [[Leon Trotsky]].<ref name="Story" /> His family were treated harshly as the family of a so-called "[[enemy of the people]]" and met death and exile during the terror. They were "[[rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]" (restored to full citizenship rights) during [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev's]] "[[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]]" of 1956-1958; Efim Dreizer was posthumously rehabilitated only in 1988, during [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev's]] [[Glasnost]] campaign.<ref name="Story" />

Chervonnaya graduated from secondary school in 1966 and enrolled in [[Moscow State University]] in the department of [[history]], where she was admitted to the elite [[American history]] program on the basis of a competitive examination taken at the end of her second year.<ref name="Story" /> She specialized in the study of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] [[New Deal]] and the post-[[World War II]] "[[New Left]]" in America, writing her [[dissertation|diploma work]]<!--This is correct Russian term--> on [[Malcolm X]] and [[black nationalism]].<ref name="Story" />

Chervonnaya married in 1970 and has two children, a daughter born in 1974 and a son born in 1987. Her husband, a [[theoretical physics|phyisicist]] and [[mathematician]], died of [[cancer]] in 1989.

===Career===
====Soviet period====

Upon completion of her university work, Chervonnaya was given a post as a member of the junior research staff at the [[Institute for the US and Canadadian Studies]], the leading research institute for American studies in the Soviet Union, where she concentrated in the study of American political opposition movements.<ref name="Story" /> After two years she was promoted to the rank of Junior Fellow and became a Senior Fellow at age 33. She was awarded the Soviet equivalent of a [[Ph.D. degree]] in 1977 and remained at the institute for three decades.<ref name="Story" />

Despite her post at the Institute of the USA and Canada, Chervonnaya decided not to join the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], a fact which, combined with her Jewish heritage, made foreign travel impossible during the [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]] era.<ref name="Story" />

Chervonnaya's initial academic work related to the study of the contemporary [[African-Americans|black]] and [[Hispanic]] movements in the United States, about which she published repeatedly in the leading Soviet [[American studies]] journal and in books.

Chervonnaya became interested in the spy cases of [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] and [[Alger Hiss]] in the 1980s, at a time when such topics were regarded as off-limits in the USSR.<ref name="Story" /> Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, she has emerged as one of the preeminent specialists on the Espionage history of the USSR and the United States. In this capacity, Chervonnaya has been a consultant and contributor to a number of television [[documentaries]], working as Associate Producer and research historian of "The Rosenberg File: Case Closed," the Moscow Field Producer of "Secrets, Lies, and Atomic Spies," as the Russian Production Coordinator of "Mystery of the U2" and other documentaries.<ref>[http://tv.yahoo.com/svetlana-chervonnaya/contributor/261353 "Svetlana Chervonnaya,"] Yahoo TV. Retrieved August 15, 2010.</ref>

====Post-Soviet period====

After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chervonnaya has worked as as a [[freelance]] writer and producer of [[documentary]] television programming, participating in the production of shows for broadcast in Russia, [[Germany]], and in the United States. In America, Chervonnaya's work has been seen on the [[Discovery channel]] (1997), [[A&E History Channel]] (1999, 2000, 2001, 2003), and [[PBS]] (1999, 2002).<ref>For details, see the annotated list of documentaries in the "Works" section on this page.</ref>

In 2009, backed by a grant from [[The Nation Institute]], a foundation associated with the American magazine ''[[The Nation]],'' Chervonnaya launched a scholarly website on Soviet espionage in America, "DocumentsTalk." The site contains [[primary source]] documents in pdf form, biographies of leading participants, as well as interpretative discussions. Since May, 2010, she is running the website on her own.

In March and April 2010, Chervonnaya was a visiting scholar at the [[Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies]], part of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in [[Washington, DC]].<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1424&fuseaction=topics.profile&person_id=563850 "Svetlana Chervonnaya,"] Kennan Institute. Retrieved August 15, 2010. Due to visa difficulties, Chervonnaya's visit was postponed two months from the planned "January-February" window.</ref>

===Historical disputes===

Chervonnaya's work in the field of espionage history has been the object of some debate. From the middle 1960s onward, scholarly debate on the history of Soviet-American relations and the history of the international Communist political movement has been divided into two more or less mutually exclusive camps <U+2014> "traditionalism" and "revisionism."<ref>The phrase "revisionism" in this context is not to be confused with the [[Holocaust denial]] movement, which ascribes to itself a similar description.</ref> These two interpretative constructs are highly correlated with matters of contemporary politics, with "traditionalists" apt to be believers in [[traditionalist conservatism]] and "revisionists" apt to be liberal or radical critics of [[militarism]] and [[nationalism]].

With the fall of the Soviet Union, new archival documents emerged and the battle over their meaning erupted anew. [[John Earl Haynes]] and [[Harvey Klehr]], two leading traditionalist voices in the field of espionage history, frame the ongoing battle between the two interpretative camps as follows:

<blockquote>
"Revisionists dominate the academy, easily outnumber traditionalists, and control the most prominent [[academic journal|historical journals]]. But traditionalist interpretations have been invigorated by the newly available archival evidence, more than a dozen scholarly books have appeared in the [first decade after the fall of the USSR] that take a traditionalist approach, and by any measure traditionalists are on the offensive. *  *  * <br /><br />
"No wonder revisionists insist on distorting what is in the archives, attempt to minimize explosive documents, and engage in crude and inappropriate name calling. They have a losing hand and are bluffing in the vain hope that other players will just lay down their winning cards."<ref>John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, ''In Denial: Historians, Communism and Espionage.'' San Francisco: Encounter Books, 2003; pg. 87.</ref></blockquote>

As a scholar who has explored recently-opened archival material on espionage and rejected several interpretations of documents regarded by some "traditionalists" as [[axiom|axiomatic]], Chervonnaya has emerged as a somewhat controversial counter-voice to what has been called the "Cold War triumphalism" of traditionalist scholars.<ref>The phrase is that of historian Ellen Schrecker. See: Ellen Schrecker (ed.), ''Cold War Triumphalism: The Misuse of History after the Fall of Communism.'' New York: The New Press, 2004.</ref>

Chernvonnaya's efforts to reexamine and reinterpret historical evidence have drawn fire from conservative critics, sometimes verging on [[ad hominem]] attack. US Air Force historian Eduard Mark has called Chervonnaya "one of the USSR's more prolific propagandists in the twilight years of the USSR,"<ref>[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jcws.2009.11.3.26?journalCode=jcws In Re Alger Hiss: A Final Verdict from the Archives of the KGB] [[Journal of Cold War Studies]] 11.3 (Summer 2009): 26-67</ref> while historian John Earl Haynes has similarly declared Chervonnaya to be a "historian/propagandist."<ref>[http://hnn.us/comments/135793.html Narcissistic Histrionics] comment on [[History News Network]] July 29, 2009</ref>
