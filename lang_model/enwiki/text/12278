'''Daniel Webster''' ([[January 18]] [[1782]] &ndash; [[October 24]] [[1852]]) was a leading [[United States|American]] [[statesman]] during the nation's [[antebellum]] era. Webster first rose to regional prominence through his defense of [[New England]] shipping interests. His increasingly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] views and the effectiveness with which he articulated them led Webster to become one of the most famous orators and influential [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] leaders of the [[Second Party System]].

As an [[attorney at law|attorney]], Webster served as legal counsel in several cases that established important constitutional precedents that bolstered the authority of the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]]. As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], he negotiated the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] that established the definitive [[Canada<U+2013>United States border|eastern border]] between the United States and [[Canada]]. Primarily recognized for his [[United States Senate|Senate]] tenure, Webster was a key figure in the institution's "Golden Age." So well-known was his skill as a Senator throughout this period that Webster became a third and northern counterpart of what was and still is known today as the "[[Great Triumvirate]]," with his colleagues [[Henry Clay]] from the west and [[John C. Calhoun]] from the south. His [[Webster-Hayne debate|"Reply to Hayne"]] in 1830 was generally regarded as "the most eloquent speech ever delivered in [[United States Congress|Congress]]."<ref> Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union" (1947) 1:288</ref>

Similar to Henry Clay, Webster's desire to see the Union preserved and conflict averted led him to search out compromises designed to stave off the sectionalism that threatened war between the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]].  Webster tried three times to achieve the [[President of the United States|Presidency]]; all three bids failed, the final one in part because of his compromises.  Similarly Webster's efforts to steer the nation away from civil war toward a definite peace ultimately proved futile. Despite this, Webster came to be esteemed for these efforts and was officially named by the Senate in 1957 as one of its five most outstanding members.

==Early life==
Webster was born [[January 18]] [[1782]] to Ebenezer and Abigail Webster (n<U+00E9>e Eastman) in [[Salisbury, New Hampshire]], which was later incorporated as a part of the present town of [[Franklin, New Hampshire|Franklin]] in 1828. There he and his nine siblings were raised on his parents' farm, a small parcel of land granted to his father in recognition of his service in the [[French and Indian War]]. As Daniel was a <U+201C>sickly<U+201D> child, his family indulged him, exempting him from the harsh rigors of 18th-century [[New England]] farm life.<ref name="American Eras">"Daniel Webster." American Eras, Volume 5: The Reform Era and Eastern U.S. Development, 1815-1850. Gale Research, 1998. Student Resource Center. Thomson Gale. 16 June 2006.</ref>

Webster attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], a preparatory school in Exeter, New Hampshire, before attending Dartmouth College.  After he graduated from [[Dartmouth College]], Webster was apprenticed to the lawyer [[Thomas W. Thompson]]. Webster was forced to resign and become a schoolmaster (as young men often did then, when [[Public education in the United States|public education]] consisted largely of subsidies to local schoolmasters), when his older brother's own quest for education put a financial strain on the family that consequently required Webster's support. When his brother's education could no longer be sustained, Webster returned to his apprenticeship. Webster left New Hampshire and got employment in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] under the prominent attorney [[Christopher Gore]] in 1804. Clerking for Gore<U+2014>who was involved in international, national, and state politics<U+2014>Webster educated himself on various political subjects and met New England politicians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=12}}</ref>

In 1805 Webster was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|accepted into the bar]] and returned to New Hampshire to set up a practice in [[Boscawen, New Hampshire|Boscawen]], in part to be near his ailing father. During this time, Webster took a more active interest in politics. Raised by an ardently [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]] father and taught by a predominantly Federalist-leaning faculty at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], Webster, like many New Englanders, supported Federalism. Accordingly, he accepted a number of minor local speaking engagements in support of Federalist causes and candidates.<ref>Cheek, H. Lee, Jr. "Webster, Daniel." In Schultz, David, ed. Encyclopedia of American Law. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2002. Facts On File, Inc. American History Online.</ref>

After his father's death in 1806, Webster handed over his practice to his older brother Ezekiel, who had by this time finished his schooling and been admitted to the bar. Webster then moved to the larger town of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] in 1807, and opened a practice there.<ref name=Discovering Biography, "Daniel Webster"/> During this time the [[Napoleonic Wars]] began to affect Americans as [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], short of sailors, strengthened its navy through the [[impressment]] of American sailors thought to be British deserters. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] retaliated with the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], ceasing all trade to both Britain and [[First French Empire|France]]. As New England was heavily reliant upon commerce with the two nations, the region vehemently opposed Jefferson's attempt at "peaceable coercion," including Webster, who wrote an anonymous pamphlet attacking it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norton|title=A People & A Nation| year=2005| pages=228}}</ref>

Eventually the trouble with England escalated into the [[War of 1812]]. That same year, Daniel Webster gave an address to the Washington Benevolent Society, an oration that proved critical to his career. The speech decried the war and the violation of New England's shipping rights that preceded it, but it also strongly denounced the extremism of those more radical among the unhappy New Englanders who were beginning to call for the region's [[secession]] from the Union.

The Washington oration was widely circulated and read throughout New Hampshire, and it led to Webster's 1812 selection to the [[Rockingham Convention]], an assembly that sought to formally declare the state's grievances with President [[James Madison]] and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. There, he was a member of the drafting committee and was chosen to compose the ''Rockingham Memorial'' to be sent to Madison. The report included much of the same tone and opinions held in the Washington Society address, except that it, uncharacteristically of its chief architect, alluded to the threat of secession saying, "If a separation of the [[U.S. state|states]] shall ever take place, it will be, on some occasion, when one portion of the country undertakes to control, to regulate, and to sacrifice the interest of another."<ref name=Discovering Biography, "Daniel Webster"/>

Webster's efforts on behalf of New England Federalism, shipping interests, and war opposition resulted in his election to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in [[United States House elections, 1812|1812]], where he served two terms ending March 1817. He was an outspoken critic of the Madison administration and its wartime policies, denouncing its efforts at financing the war through paper money and opposing [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[James Monroe]]'s [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] proposal. Notable in his second term was his support of the reestablishment of a stable specie-based [[History of central banking in the United States|national bank]]; but he opposed the [[tariff of 1816]] (which sought to protect the nation's manufacturing interests) and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] Henry Clay's [[American System (economic plan)|American System]].

This opposition was in accordance with a number of his professed beliefs (and the majority of his constituents') including [[free trade]], that the tariff's "great object was to raise revenue, not to foster manufacture," and that it was against "the true spirit of the Constitution" to give "excessive bounties or encouragements to one [industry] over another."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/WAT_WIL/WEBSTER_DANIEL_1782_1852_.html|title=WEBSTER, DANIEL (1782-1852)| publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th Edition.| accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=54}}</ref>

After his second term, Webster did not seek a third, choosing his law practice instead. In an attempt to secure greater financial success for himself and his family (he had married Grace Fletcher in 1808, with whom he had four children), he moved his practice from Portsmouth to Boston.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=25}}</ref>

==Notable Supreme Court Cases==
[[Image:DanielWebster DartmouthCollegeCase.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Webster pleads Dartmouth's case before the Court.]]

Webster had been highly regarded in New Hampshire since his days in Boscawen, and had been respected throughout the House during his service there. He came to national prominence, however, as counsel in a number of important [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] cases.<ref name="American Eras"/> These cases remain major [[precedent]]s in the [[United States constitutional law|Constitutional jurisprudence]] of the United States.

In 1816, Webster was retained by the Federalist trustees of his alma mater, [[Dartmouth College]], to represent them in their case against the newly elected New Hampshire [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]]. The legislature had passed new laws converting Dartmouth into a state institution, by changing the size of the college's trustee body and adding a further board of overseers, which they put into the hands of the state senate.<ref>Baker, Thomas E. "Dartmouth College v. Woodward." In Schultz, David, ed. Encyclopedia of American Law. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2002. Facts On File, Inc. American History Online.</ref> New Hampshire argued that they, as successor in sovereignty to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], who had chartered Dartmouth, had the right to revise the charter.

| style="text-align: left;" | 
"This, sir, is my case. It is the case not merely of that humble institution, it is the case of every college in our land... Sir, you may destroy this little institution; it is weak; it is in your hands! I know it is one of the lesser lights in the literary horizon of our country. You may put it out. But if you do so you must carry through your work! You must extinguish, one after another, all those greater lights of science which for more than a century have thrown their radiance over our land. ''It is, sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it!"''
|-
| style="text-align: right;" | '''Daniel Webster''' ('''''Dartmouth College v. Woodward''')

Webster argued ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'' to the Supreme Court (with significant aid from [[Jeremiah Mason]] and [[Jeremiah Smith]]), invoking [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the states|Article I, section 10]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] (the [[Contract Clause]]) against the State. The [[John Marshall|Marshall court]], continuing with its history of limiting [[states' rights]] and reaffirming the supremacy of the Constitutional protection of contract, ruled in favor of Webster and Dartmouth 3<U+2013>1. This decided that [[corporations law|corporations]] did not, as many then held, have to justify their privileges by acting in the public interest, but were independent of the states.<ref>O'Brien, Patrick K., gen. ed. "Dartmouth College case." Encyclopedia of World History. Copyright George Philip Limited. New York: Facts On File, Inc., 2000. Facts On File, Inc. World History Online. Schlesinger ''Age of Jackson''. p. 324-5</ref>

Other notable appearances by Webster before the Supreme Court include his representation of James McCulloch in ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819), the Cohens in ''[[Cohens v. Virginia]]'', and  Thomas Gibbons in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824), cases similar to ''Dartmouth'' in the court's application of a broad interpretation of the Constitution and strengthening of the federal courts' power to constrain the states, which have since been used to justify wide powers for the federal government. Webster's handling of these cases made him one of the era's foremost constitutional lawyers, as well as one of the most highly paid.<ref>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica.

==Return to politics==
Webster's growing prominence as a constitutional lawyer led to his election as a delegate to the 1820 [[Massachusetts]] [[Constitutional Convention]]. There he spoke in opposition to [[universal suffrage]] (for men), on the Federalist grounds that power naturally follows [[property]], and the vote should be limited accordingly; but the [[Massachusetts Constitution|constitution]] was amended against his advice.<ref>{{cite book|last= Schlesinger|title=The Age of Jackson | year=1945| pages=12-15 }}</ref> He also supported the (existing) districting of the [[Massachusetts Senate|State Senate]] so that each seat represented an equal amount of property.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=113}}</ref>

Webster's performance at the convention furthered his reputation. [[Joseph Story]] (also a delegate at the convention) wrote to Jeremiah Mason following the convention saying "Our friend Webster has gained a noble reputation. He was before known as a lawyer; but he has now secured the title of an eminent and enlightened statesman."<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=38}}</ref> Webster also spoke at [[Plymouth (town), Massachusetts|Plymouth]] commemorating the [[Plymouth Rock|landing]] of the [[Pilgrims]] in [[1620]]; his oration was widely circulated and read throughout New England. He was elected to the [[18th United States Congress|Eighteenth Congress]] in [[United States House elections, 1822|1822]], from Boston.

In his second term, Webster found himself a leader of the fragmented House Federalists who had split following the failure of the secessionist-minded 1814 [[Hartford Convention]] that he avoided. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Henry Clay]] made Webster chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]] in an attempt to win his and the Federalists' support. His term of service in the House between 1822 and 1828 was marked by his legislative success at reforming the United States criminal code, and his failure at expanding the size of the Supreme Court. He largely supported the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican]] administration of [[John Quincy Adams]], including Adams' candidacy in the highly contested [[United States presidential election, 1824|election of 1824]] and the administration's defense of treaty-sanctioned [[Creek people|Creek Indian]] land rights against [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'s expansionist claims.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=49}}</ref>

While a Representative, Webster continued accepting speaking engagements in New England, most notably his oration on the fiftieth anniversary of  ''[[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]'' (1825) and his eulogy on ''[[John Adams|Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]'' (1826). With the support of a coalition of both Federalists and Republicans, Webster's record in the House and his celebrity as an orator led to his June 1827 election to the Senate from Massachusetts. His first wife, Grace, died in January 1828, and he married Caroline LeRoy in December 1829.

==Senate==
[[Image:06-18-2006 10;50;42PM (2).JPG|right|thumb|250px|''Webster Replying to Hayne'' by George P.A. Healy]]

When Webster returned to the Senate from his wife's funeral in March 1828, he found the body considering a [[Tariff of Abominations|new tariff bill]] that sought to increase the [[duty (economics)|duties]] on foreign manufactured goods on top of the increases of 1824 and 1816, both of which Webster had opposed. Now, however, Webster changed his position to support a protective tariff. Explaining the change, Webster stated that after the failure of the rest of the nation to heed New England's objections in 1816 and 1824, "nothing was left to New England but to conform herself to the will of others," and now consequently being heavily invested in manufacturing, he would not now do them injury. It is the more blunt opinion of Justus D. Doenecke that Webster's support of the 1828 tariff was a result of "his new closeness to the rising mill-owning families of the region, the [[Abbott Lawrence|Lawrences]] and the [[Lowell family|Lowells]]."<ref name=Discovering Biography, "Daniel Webster">"Daniel Webster." Discovering Biography. Online Edition. Gale, 2003. Student Resource Center. Thomson Gale. 16 June 2006</ref> Webster also gave greater approval to Clay's American System, a change that along with his modified view of the tariff brought him closer to Henry Clay.

The passage of the tariff brought increased sectional tensions to the U.S., tensions that were agitated by then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]]'s promulgation of his [[South Carolina Exposition and Protest]]. The exposition espoused the idea of [[nullification]], a doctrine first articulated in the U.S. by [[James Madison|Madison]] and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]] that held that states were [[sovereignty|sovereign]] entities and held ultimate authority over the limits of the power of the federal government, and could thus "nullify" any act of the central government it deemed unconstitutional. While for a time the tensions increased by Calhoun's exposition lay beneath the surface, they burst forth when [[South Carolina]] Senator [[Robert Young Hayne]] opened the 1830 [[Webster-Hayne debate]].

By 1830, Federal land policy had long been an issue. The National Republican administration had held land prices high. According to Adams' [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Richard Rush]], this served to provide the federal government with an additional source of revenue, but also to discourage [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward migration]] that tended to increase wages through the increased scarcity of labor.<ref>{{cite book|last= Schlesinger|title=The Age of Jackson | year=1945| pages= 347}}</ref> Senator Hayne, in an effort to sway the west against the north and the tariff, seized upon a minor point in the land debate and accused the north of attempting to limit western expansion for their own benefit. As Vice President Calhoun was [[President of the Senate|presiding officer]] over the Senate but could not address the Senate in business, James Schouler contended that Hayne was doing what Calhoun could not.<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:Daguerreotype-Daniel-Webster.jpg|thumb|left|210px|An early [[daguerreotype]] of Daniel Webster]]

The next day, Webster, feeling compelled to respond on New England's behalf, gave his first rebuttal to Hayne, highlighting what he saw as the virtues of the North's policies toward the west and claiming that restrictions on western expansion and growth were primarily the responsibility of [[Southern United States|southerners]]. Hayne in turn responded the following day, denouncing Webster's inconsistencies with regards to the American system and personally attacking Webster for his role in the so called "[[corrupt bargain]]" of 1824. The course of the debate strayed even further away from the initial matter of land sales with Hayne openly defending the "Carolina Doctrine" of nullification as being the doctrine of Jefferson and Madison. <!-- This needs reference -->

When my eyes shall be turned to behold
for the last time the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the
broken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union; on States
dissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or
drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and
lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the republic... not a stripe
erased or polluted, nor a single star obscured, bearing for its motto,
no such miserable interrogatory as "What is all this worth?" nor those
other words of delusion and folly, "Liberty first and Union afterwards";
but everywhere, spread all over in characters of living light, blazing
on all its ample folds, as they float over the sea and over the land,
and in every wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear to
every true American heart,<U+2014> Liberty and Union, now and for ever, one
and inseparable!''
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | '''Daniel Webster''' ('''''Second Reply to Hayne''''')
|}
On [[January 26]], Webster gave his ''Second Reply to Hayne'', in which Webster openly attacked Nullification, negatively contrasted South Carolina's response to the tariff with that of his native New England's response to the Embargo of 1807, rebutted Hayne's personal attacks against him, and famously concluded in defiance of nullification (which was later embodied in John C. Calhoun's declaration of ''"The Union; second to our liberty most dear!"''), ''"Liberty and Union, now and for ever, one and inseparable!"''

While the debate's philosophical presentation of nullification and Webster's abstract fears of rebellion were brought into reality in 1832 when Calhoun's native South Carolina passed its [[Ordinance of Nullification]], Webster supported President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s sending of U.S. troops to the borders of South Carolina and the [[Force Bill]], not Henry Clay's 1833 compromise that eventually defused the crisis. Webster thought Clay's concessions were dangerous and would only further embolden the south and legitimize its tactics. Especially unsettling was the resolution affirming that "the people of the several States composing these United States are united as parties to a constitutional compact, to which the people of each State ''acceded'' as a separate sovereign community." The usage of the word ''accede'' would, in his opinion, lead to the logical end of those states' right to secede. 
{| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#b0c4de; color:black; width:35em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"

Since I have arrived here [in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]], I have had an application to be concerned, professionally, against the bank, which I have declined, of course, although I believe my retainer has not been renewed or refreshed as usual. If it be wished that my relation to the Bank should be continued, it may be well to send me the usual retainers.''
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | '''Daniel Webster''' ('''''A letter to officials at the bank''''')
|}
At the same time however, Webster, like Clay, opposed the economic policies of Andrew Jackson, the most famous of those being Jackson's campaign against the [[Second Bank of the United States]] in 1832, an institution that held Webster on retainer as legal counsel and of whose Boston Branch he was the director. Clay, Webster, and a number of other former Federalists and National Republicans united as the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], in defense of the Bank against Jackson's intention to replace it. There was an economic [[Panic of 1837|panic in 1837]], which converted Webster's heavy speculation in [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] property into a personal debt from which Webster never recovered. His debt was exacerbated by his propensity for living "habitually beyond his means", lavishly furnishing his estate and giving away money with "reckless generosity and heedless profusion", in addition to indulging the smaller-scale "passions and appetites" of gambling and alcohol.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=118}}</ref>

In [[United States presidential election, 1836|1836]], Webster was one of three Whig Party candidates to run for the office of [[President of the United States|President]], but he only managed to gain the support of Massachusetts. This was the first of three unsuccessful attempts at gaining the presidency. In [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]], the Whig Party nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] for president. Webster was offered the vice presidency, but he declined.

==As Secretary of State==
Following his victory in 1840, President Harrison appointed Webster to the post of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in 1841, a post he retained under President [[John Tyler]] after the death of Harrison a month after his inauguration. In September 1841, an internal division amongst the Whigs over the question of the National Bank caused all the Whigs (except Webster who was in Europe at the time) to resign from Tyler's [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]]. In 1842, he was the architect of the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]], which resolved the [[Caroline Affair]], established the definitive [[Canada<U+2013>United States border|Eastern border]] between the United States and [[Canada]] ([[Maine]] and [[New Brunswick]]), and signaled a definite and lasting peace between the United States and Britain. Webster succumbed to Whig pressure in May 1842 and finally left the cabinet.

==Later career and death==
[[Image:WebsterbyLamb.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Portrait of Daniel Webster]]

In 1845 he was re-elected to the Senate, where he opposed both the [[Texas Annexation|annexation]] of [[Texas]] and the resulting [[Mexican-American War]] for fear of its upsetting the delicate balance of [[History of slavery in the United States|slave and non-slave states]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848]], he sought the Whig Party's nomination for President but was beaten by military hero [[Zachary Taylor]]. Webster was once again offered the vice presidency, but he declined saying, "I do not propose to be buried until I am dead." The Whig ticket won the election; Taylor died 16 months later.

The [[Compromise of 1850]] was the Congressional effort led by Clay and [[Stephen Douglas]] to compromise the sectional disputes that seemed to be headed toward civil war. On [[March 7]] [[1850]], Webster gave one of his most famous speeches, characterizing himself "not as a Massachusetts man, nor as a Northern man but as an American..." In it he gave his support to the compromise, which included the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] that required federal officials to recapture and return runaway slaves.

Webster was bitterly attacked by [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] in New England who felt betrayed by his compromises. Rev. [[Theodore Parker]] complained, "No living man has done so much to debauch the conscience of the nation." [[Horace Mann]] described him as being "a fallen star! [[Lucifer]] descending from Heaven!" [[James Russell Lowell]] called Webster "the most meanly and foolishly treacherous man I ever heard of."<ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|title=Profiles in Courage| year=2004| pages=69-70}}</ref> Webster never recovered the popularity he lost in the aftermath of the ''Seventh of March'' speech.

Resigning the Senate under a cloud in 1850, he resumed his former position as Secretary of State in the cabinet of Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]]. Notable in this second tenure was the increasingly strained relationship between the United States and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in the aftermath of what was seen by Austria as American interference in its rebellious [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. As chief American diplomat, Webster authored the H<U+00FC>lsemann Letter, in which he defended what he believed to be America's right to take an active interest in the internal politics of Hungary, while still maintaining its neutrality. He also advocated for the establishment of commercial relations with [[Edo period|Japan]], going so far as to draft the letter that was to be presented to the [[Emperor K<U+014D>mei]] on President Fillmore's behalf by Commodore [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Matthew Perry]] on his 1852 voyage to Asia.  	

In [[United States presidential election, 1852|1852]] he made his final campaign for the Presidency, again for the Whig nomination. Before and during the campaign a number of critics asserted that his support of the compromise was only an attempt to win southern support for his candidacy, "profound selfishness," in the words of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. Though the ''Seventh of March'' speech was indeed warmly received throughout the south, the speech made him too [[polarization (politics)|polarizing]] a figure to receive the nomination and Webster was again defeated by a military hero, this time General [[Winfield Scott]].

He died on [[October 24]] [[1852]] at his home in [[Marshfield, Massachusetts]], after falling from his horse and suffering a crushing blow to the head, complicated by [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, which resulted in a [[cerebral hemorrhage|brain hemorrhage]].<ref>Remini, p. 761</ref>

His son, [[Fletcher Webster]], went on to be a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[Colonel]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] commanding the [[12th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]], but was [[killed in action]] on [[August 29]] [[1862]] during the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]]. Today a monument stands in his honor in [[Manassas, Virginia]], as well as a regimental monument on Oak Hill at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].

==Historical evaluations and legacy==
[[Image:Daniel Webster.JPG|thumb|left|Monument to Daniel Webster located on [[Scott Circle]] in Washington, D.C.]]

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who had criticized Webster following the Seventh of March address, remarked in the immediate aftermath of his death that Webster was "the completest man", and that "nature had not in our days or not since [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], cut out such a masterpiece." Others like [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] noted Webster's vices, especially the perpetual debt against which he, as Lodge reports, employed "checks or notes for several thousand dollars in token of admiration" from his friends. "This was, of course, utterly wrong and demoralizing, but Mr. Webster came, after a time, to look upon such transactions as natural and proper. [...] He seems to have regarded the merchants and bankers of [[State Street Corp.|State Street]] very much as a feudal baron regarded his peasantry. It was their privilege and duty to support him, and he repaid them with an occasional magnificent compliment."<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=118}}</ref>

Several historians suggest Webster failed to exercise leadership for any political issue or vision. Lodge describes (with the Rockingham Convention in mind) Webster's "susceptibility to outside influences which formed such an odd trait in the character of a man so imperious by nature. When acting alone, he spoke his own opinions. When in a situation where public opinion was concentrated against him, he submitted to modifications of his views with a curious and indolent indifference."<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=18}}</ref> Similarly, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger]] cites Webster's letter requesting retainers for fighting for the Bank, one of his most inveterate causes; he then asks how the American people could "follow [Webster] through hell or high water when he would not lead unless someone made up a purse for him?"

He served the interest of the wealthy Boston merchants who elected and supported him, first for free trade, and later, when they had started manufacturing, for protection; both for the Union and for a compromise with the South in 1850. Schlesinger remarks that the real miracle of ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'' is not a soul sold to the devil, or the jury of ghostly traitors, but Webster speaking against the sanctity of contract.

Webster has garnered respect and admiration for his Seventh of March speech in defense of the 1850 compromise measures that helped to delay the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', Kennedy called Webster's defense of the compromise, despite the risk to his presidential ambitions and the denunciations he faced from the north, one of the "greatest acts of courageous principle" in the history of the Senate. Conversely, ''Seventh of March'' has been criticized by Lodge who contrasted the speech's support of the 1850 compromise with his 1833 rejection of similar measures. "While he was brave and true and wise in 1833," said Lodge, "in 1850 he was not only inconsistent, but that he erred deeply in policy and statesmanship" in his advocacy of a policy that "made war inevitable by encouraging slave-holders to believe that they could always obtain anything they wanted by a sufficient show of violence."<ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=103,105}}</ref>

More widely agreed upon, notably by both Senator Lodge and President Kennedy, is Webster's skill as an orator with Kennedy praising Webster's "ability to make alive and supreme the latent sense of oneness, of union, that all Americans felt but few could express."<ref name="orator">{{cite book|last=Kennedy|title=Profiles in Courage| year=2004| pages=58}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lodge|title=Daniel Webster| year=1883| pages=66}}</ref> Schlesinger, however, notes that he is also an example of the limitations of formal oratory: Congress heard Webster or Clay with admiration, but they rarely prevailed at the vote. Plainer speech and party solidarity were more effective; and Webster never approached Jackson's popular appeal.<ref>{{cite book|last= Schlesinger|title=The Age of Jackson | year=1945| pages= 50-2 }}</ref>

==Commemorative measures==
Webster has been commemorated in numerous forms: the popular short story, play (and movie) ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'' by [[Stephen Vincent Ben<U+00E9>t]]; one of the two statues representing New Hampshire in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] in the [[United States Capitol]]; a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[submarine]], the [[USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626)|USS ''Daniel Webster'']]; a peak in New Hampshire's [[Presidential Range]], [[Mount Webster (Coos County, New Hampshire)|Mount Webster]]; a college, [[Daniel Webster College]], located in [[Nashua, New Hampshire]]; and on U.S. stamps (in 1890 on a 10 cent stamp and in 1932 on a 2 cent stamp on the occasion of the 150th anniversry of his birth). A reference to Webster is also made in the 1939 film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', when [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]]'s character is amazed to find out that he will be sitting in the same Senate seat that Webster once occupied. Also, New Hampshire's [[Boy Scout]] council bears his name, Daniel Webster Council. In 1957 a senatorial committee chaired by then-Senator Kennedy named Webster as one of their five greatest predecessors, selecting Webster's oval portrait (seen in the infobox above) to adorn the Senate Reception Room off the Senate floor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Famous_Five_Seven.htm |title=The "Famous Five" Now the "Famous Seven" |publisher=Senate Historical Office |accessdate=2006-10-26}}</ref> {{libship honor| name = Daniel Webster | type = his}}
[[Webster Township, Michigan|Webster Township]] and Webster United Church of Christ of [[Dexter, Michigan|Dexter]], [[Washtenaw County, Michigan]], are named for Webster; he is reported to have contributed the sum of one hundred dollars to the church's construction in 1834.<ref>See web site: http://www.twp.webster.mi.us/historyA.htm</ref>
