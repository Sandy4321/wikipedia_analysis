"'''You'll Never Walk Alone'''" is a [[show tune]] from the 1945 [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''.

In the musical, in the second act, Nettie Fowler, the cousin of the female protagonist Julie Jordan, sings "You'll Never Walk Alone" to comfort and encourage Julie when her husband, Billy Bigelow, the male lead, kills himself to avoid capture during a failed robbery. It is [[reprise]]d in the final scene to encourage a graduation class of which Louise (Billy and Julie's daughter) is a member. Billy watches this ceremony during his return to earth.

The song is also sung at [[football (soccer)|association football]] clubs around the world, where it is performed by a massed chorus of supporters on matchday; this tradition began at [[Liverpool Football Club]] in the early 1960s and later spread to several other clubs.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AXxf52k0cE Liverpool vs. Leeds United], F.A. Cup Final, BBC, 1965. "The song was covered by Liverpool group Gerry & The Pacemakers in 1963. At this time, supporters standing on the Spion Kop terrace at Anfield began singing popular chart songs of the day. The mood was captured on camera by a BBC ''Panorama'' camera crew in 1964. One year later, when Liverpool faced Leeds in the cup final, the travelling Kop sang the same song and match commentator [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]] commended the 'Liverpool signature tune'." Paul Coslett, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2008/06/09/youll_never_walk_alone_feature.shtml You'll Never Walk Alone] BBC Online. 9 June 2008.</ref>

==Background==
[[Christine Johnson (actress)|Christine Johnson]], who created the role of Nettie Fowler, introduced the song in the original [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlsUfOjVhrM |title=You'll Never Walk Alone (original version 1945) |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref>  Later in the show [[Jan Clayton]], as Julie Jordan, reprised it, with the chorus joining in. 

In the film, it is sung by [[Claramae Turner]] as Nettie.  The weeping Julie ([[Shirley Jones]]) tries to sing it but cannot; it is later reprised by Ms. Jones and a chorus.

==Subsequent history==
Besides the recordings of the song on the ''Carousel'' [[cast album]]s and the film soundtrack, the song has been recorded by many artists, with notable hit versions made by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Gerry & the Pacemakers]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Doris Day]]. [[Progressive rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]] took a version sung by the [[Liverpool F.C.]] [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Kop]] choir, and "interpolated" it into their own song, "[[Fearless (Pink Floyd song)|Fearless]]", on their 1971 album, ''[[Meddle]]''.

Since 1964, [[Jerry Lewis]] has concluded the annual [[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]] by singing the song.<ref>"Milestones: Retiring: Jerry Lewis", ''Time'' magazine, May 30, 2011, p. 17</ref>  American singer and songwriter [[Barbra Streisand]] sang this song in a surprise appearance at the close of the [[53rd Primetime Emmy Awards|2001 Emmy Awards]], in honor of the victims of the [[September 11th, 2001 attacks]].<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/2001-12-12-streisandside.htm Streisand's stage fright spiked with thought of terror], By Edna Gundersen, USA TODAY, 12-12-2001</ref>

In ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy]]'', the onboard computer Eddie sings this song in an attempt to calm the crew of the ''Heart of Gold'' as their imminent destruction approaches in the form of a missile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/hitchhikers_guide_galaxy/characters/ |title=The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy - Character Guide - British Comedy Guide |publisher=Comedy.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}</ref>

Ren<U+00E9>e Fleming sang the song for the Obama Inauguration on January 20, 2009.  In 2010, this was sung during the festivities of the Last Night of [[the Proms]], with the choir at the [[Albert Hall]] joined by crowds of the public from Hillsborough Castle, Northern Ireland; Caird Hall, Dundee; Hyde Park, London; Salford, Greater Manchester; and Wales. This was to commemorate the death of Oscar Hammerstein II.

In the United Kingdom, the song's most successful recording was released in 1963 by the [[Liverpool|Liverpudlian]] [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] group [[Gerry & the Pacemakers]] (peaking at number one in the singles chart for four consecutive weeks).

The song quickly became the anthem of [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]] and is invariably sung by its supporters moments before the start of each home game.<ref name="Liverpool Celtic">Aldred, Jessica. [http://football.guardian.co.uk/news/theknowledge/0,9204,912750,00.html Liverpool or Celtic: who Walked Alone first?] ''The Guardian''. March 12, 2003.</ref> The words "You'll Never Walk Alone" also feature in the club crest and on the Shankly Gate entrance to [[Anfield]], the home stadium.

According to former player Tommy Smith, [[Gerry Marsden]] presented Liverpool manager [[Bill Shankly]] with a tape recording of his forthcoming cover single during a pre-season coach trip in the summer of 1963. "Shanks was in awe of what he heard. [...] Football writers from the local newspapers were travelling with our party and, thirsty for a story of any kind between games, filed copy back to their editors to the effect that we had adopted Gerry Marsden's forthcoming single as the club song."<ref>Smith, Tommy. ''Anfield Iron'',  Bantam Press, p. 68-69</ref>

Marsden himself told BBC Radio how, in the 1960s, the DJ at Anfield would play the top-ten commercial records in ascending order, with the number one single transmitted last, shortly before kickoff. Spectators would sing along, but unlike with other hit singles, once "You'll Never Walk Alone" dropped out of the top-ten, instead of dropping the song, supporters continued to sing along.<ref>Cavanagh, John. "The History of You'll Never Walk Alone", BBC Songlines, 2006.</ref><ref>Morgan, John. "The Other Mersey Sound", BBC Panorama, 1964.</ref>

The song was later adopted by Scottish team [[Celtic F.C.]],<ref name="Liverpool Celtic" /> Dutch teams [[Feyenoord]] and [[FC Twente]],<ref>Whyatt, Chris. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7556749.stm McClaren's new charges] BBC. 13 August 2008.</ref> Germany's [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[1.FC Kaiserslautern]], [[FC St Pauli]] and Japan's [[F.C. Tokyo]].<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/5xWbctyiG Nagatomo tells Japan "You'll never walk alone"], ''The mainichi Daily News''. March 2011.</ref>

The [[Pink Floyd]] song "[[Fearless (Pink Floyd song)|Fearless]]", from their 1971 album ''[[Meddle]]'', includes a recording of the Liverpool [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Kop]] singing "You'll Never Walk Alone". The recording is repeated many times during the song and appears solely as a conclusion at the end of the track.

A special recording of the song was made in solidarity with [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] following the [[Bradford City stadium fire|Valley Parade fire]] in 1985, when 56 spectators died and many more were seriously injured. The song was performed by [[The Crowd (music)|The Crowd]], featuring Gerry Marsden, [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Rolf Harris]], among others.

Some years later, after witnessing a rendition of "You'll Never Walk Alone" at Anfield in 2007, the President of the [[Spanish Olympic Committee]], Alejandro Blanco, said he felt inspired to seek lyrics to his country's wordless national anthem, the [[Marcha Real|Royal March]], ahead of [[Madrid bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics|Madrid's bid]] to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Olympic Games]].<ref>[http://www.webcitation.org/5bUccOnOm Liverpool fans inspire Spain to write words to anthem], Reuters. June 5, 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19442872/ Spain to add lyrics to wordless national anthem], MSNBC. June 26, 2007.</ref>

The song was also performed by 17-year-old highschool student Alina Schmidt at the public funeral of German football goalkeeper [[Robert Enke]] (who committed suicide after years of suffering from depression) to an audience of 45,000 at his team's [[Hanover|Hanover's]] [[AWD-Arena|stadium]] on November 15, 2009.

The song was sung by supporters of the A-League team Brisbane Roar to commemorate the victims of the 2011 Queensland Floods at the 2011 A-League Grand Final.
