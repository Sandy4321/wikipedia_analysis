The '''Alexander Dennis Enviro500''' (previously known as the '''TransBus Enviro500''') is a tri-axle [[double-decker bus]] built by [[Alexander Dennis]] (formerly by TransBus) in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was unveiled in 2002 and is one of the Enviro-series bus models made by TransBus/Alexander Dennis.

==Original design==
The [[Dennis Specialist Vehicles|Dennis]] chassis for Enviro500 (also known as '''Trident E500'''<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fleet Directory of Hong Kong Buses: K.M.B. & Long Win Bus|last= Yung|first= Stanley|year= 2006|month= December|publisher= BSI Hobbies (H.K.) Co.|isbn= 962-8414-83-6|url= http://www.bsihobbies.hk/main-a2.htm|page= 96}}</ref>) was modified from [[Dennis Trident 3|Trident 3]]. It can be fitted with [[Cummins]] ISMe335 Euro III engine (later Cummins ISLe340 Euro IV/Euro V engine which uses [[AdBlue]] to reduce emission of nitrogen oxides through [[selective catalytic reduction]] process), or ISM-330 engine for the buses delivered to [[North America]], and coupled to [[Voith]] DIWA864.3E 4-speed or [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 5HP602 5-speed gearbox. Later Voith DIWA864.5 4-speed gearbox, ZF 6HP602 6-speed gearbox and [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] B500R 6-speed gearbox became available and now they are the standard configurations.

Initially only the 12-metre (40&nbsp;ft)-long version of the Enviro500 was built, but in 2007 Alexander Dennis announced the production of the 12.8-metre-long version,<ref>[http://www.alexander-dennis.com/news/company_stories/news_story26.html Alexander Dennis - News: No stopping the bus as resurgent ADL steps up a gear for 2008]</ref> and an 11.3-metre-long variant followed in 2008.

Later Alexander Dennis developed the hybrid electric version of Enviro500, known as the '''Enviro500H''', with GM-Allison's parallel hybrid drive system; it was unveiled in late 2008.<ref>[http://www.busandcoach.com/featureStory.aspx?id=1684 Bus and Coach.com - Analysis: ADL accelerates]</ref><ref name="USassembly">[http://www.busandcoach.com/newsStory.aspx?id=2132 Bus and Coach News - ADL announces US assembly deal]</ref>

The body of the Enviro500 was based on the original style of the single-deck [[Alexander Dennis Enviro300|Enviro300]], and the upper-deck frontal design was similar to the design used on the [[Plaxton President]] body.

The vehicle exceeded some design limitations in Hong Kong, prompting the local Transport Department to make some exclusions in order to make the buses available to [[Kowloon Motor Bus|KMB]] on time.
* The width of the bus is 2550&nbsp;mm (100.3 inches), exceeded the limit of 2500&nbsp;mm (98.4 inches). The width of 2550&nbsp;mm, approved by the [[EU]], became the current standard.
* A fixed glass replaced the emergency door at the rear of the upper deck, but with more hammers available for emergency.
* The front indicators are the smallest of all current models of [[Kowloon Motor Bus|KMB]].

The facelifted version of Enviro500 body, first built in late 2003, have revised frontal and rear designs. This version of Enviro500 bodywork ws also available with [[Volvo B9TL]] chassis.

In 2011, Alexander Dennis unveiled the Enviro500 with new frontal design, which had the same front with the Enviro400.

The Enviro500 and is designed and built according to current [[Europe]]an standards and the operating environment of [[Hong Kong]].

====Kowloon Motor Bus====
The Enviro500 is the first model of second-generation [[low-floor bus]]es for [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], with straight staircase and [[plug door]] (only at the exit) fitted. All KMB's Enviro500 buses had a bronze band added to the champagne [[livery]] to differentiate them from the first-generation low-floor buses.

When TransBus announced the development of the Enviro500, KMB became the launch customer by switching the last 20 of an order of 100 Dennis Trident 3 to the Enviro500 in 2002. Later in the same year, KMB placed a second order for a further 100 of the vehicles. The first Enviro500 arrived in Hong Kong on 12 November 2002 and was registered in January 2003. The remaining 119 buses entered service between March 2003 and November 2003.

In 2003 KMB placed the third order for 65 Enviro500s, quickly followed by a further 50. The bodywork of these buses received a number of minor modifications. The first 112 buses entered service between November 2003 and June 2005, and the remaining three buses were registered by its subsidiary [[Long Win Bus]].

Due to the commencement of the [[KCR West Rail]] in late 2003 and [[KCR Ma On Shan Rail]] in late 2004, Transport Department of Hong Kong requested KMB to reduce its fleet size, so the registration of these four batches of KMB Enviro500 were delayed and some of them were stored for a long time before entering service.

In 2005, KMB placed a further order for 25 more vehicles with modified bodywork and new Alexander Dennis badge, 24 of them (five had their electronic route destination displays supplied by [[Gorba AG|Gorba]] instead of [[Hanover Displays|Hanover]]) entered service in early 2006. The last one, a Euro IV-engined prototype, with fleet number ATEU1 (originally ATE257), has entered service on 24 May 2006. In 2009, it reemerged as a Euro V-engined bus.<ref>[http://www.kmb.hk/english.php?page=next&file=news/service/news1q09/news20090213_01.html KMB Introduces the First Euro V Engine]</ref>

In late 2005, KMB ordered 15 more buses which entered service in August 2006.

Later a batch of 9 buses with Euro IV engines was ordered for delivery in 2009, which entered service in mid-2009. One of them was fitted with luggage rack after body assembly. It was quickly followed by another batch of 46 buses for delivery in 2010, 20 of them were eventually diverted to Long Win Bus, and 26 buses entered service with KMB in 2010-2011.

A batch of 35 buses with Euro V engines was ordered for delivery in 2010-2011, 30 of them were eventually diverted to Long Win Bus, and 5 buses entered service with KMB in 2011.

=====Early Withdrawal=====
In July 2008, one of KMB's Enviro500 [Fleet number ATE180 (LN5481)] was written off after being burnt out in KMB's depot in Tin Shui Wai on 31 March 2008.

====Long Win Bus====
[[Long Win Bus]] registered three Enviro500 buses, which were acquired from KMB, in August 2005 (with fleet number 801-803) to cope with the increased demand for bus services after the opening of [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

In late 2005, Long Win Bus ordered five more buses which had luggage racks fitted when new. The first four buses (804-807) entered service in June/July 2006. The last one (fleet number 601), which was fitted with coach seats, entered service in July 2006.

A further batch of seven buses with Euro IV engines had been ordered for delivery in 2009. The first six buses entered service in mid-late 2009. The last one, which was fitted with coach seats, entered service in October 2009. These were followed by further five buses, with the first four being registered in December 2009; the last one, which was fitted with coach seats, entered service in April 2010. In 2010, Long Win Bus received twenty more Enviro500 buses with Euro IV engines.

A batch of 6 Enviro500 buses with Euro V engines was ordered for delivery in 2010-2011. These, together with thirty buses diverted from KMB's order, were put into service between 2011 and 2013.

====Citybus====
[[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] ordered 10 Enviro500s with Euro IV engine and luggage racks, soon after its sister company New World First Bus's order. The first batch of chassis arrived Hong Kong in the third quarter of 2007 for body assembly in NWFB depot at Chong Fu Road. They entered service in December 2007/January 2008 (as 8100 - 8109).

A further batch of 18 buses with Euro IV engines had been ordered for delivery in 2009, they entered service in 2009. They were followed by another 77 buses, they entered service in 2010-2011 (as 8110 - 8127 and 8128 - 8204).

In 2011 Citybus ordered 115 Enviro500s, with 3 of them being fitted with luggage racks when new (as 8205 - 8320).

====MTR====
[[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]] originally ordered 9 12-metre long Euro IV-engined Enviro500 buses in early 2007 for its [[KCR Feeder Bus|Feeder Bus]] service.<ref name="newbuses">[http://www.alexander-dennis.com/news/company_stories/news_story22.html Alexander Dennis - News: Flying start as market leader wins <U+00A3>25M of new orders in first week of 2007]</ref> The first completed bus arrived Hong Kong on 24 November 2007, then registered in February 2008 and entered service in March 2008; the rest of them entered service in March/April 2008.

Due to a railway merger between [[MTR]] and [[Kowloon-Canton Railway|KCR]] in late-2007, they are now operated by [[MTR Corporation]] for running [[MTR Feeder Bus]] (previously known as KCR Feeder Bus) routes.

Later a batch of 15 buses with Euro IV engines was ordered for delivery in 2009, they were first registered in April<U+2013>August 2009. This was followed by another order for 9 buses in 11.3-metre length which entered service in 2012.

====New World First Bus====
[[File:OTSWashingtonDCinsideEnviro500.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The driver's panel inside an Enviro500 in [[Washington, D.C]] for an open top double decker bus]]
[[New World First Bus]] ordered 18 Enviro500 buses with Euro IV engine in early 2007.<ref name="newbuses" /> 17 buses entered service in early/mid-2008, another one (fleet number 5504) was shipped to Australia in March 2008, after body assembly, for demonstration in several cities between April and May 2008, it finally entered service in June 2008.

In 2008 New World First Bus ordered twenty 11.3m-long buses with Euro IV engines for delivery in 2009. They entered service in July<U+2013>October 2009. A further batch of twenty similar buses with Euro V engines entered service in early 2010.

====CLP Group====
[[CLP Group]] ordered 5 Enviro500 buses with Euro IV engines for its staff shuttle bus service in 2008. The specification is similar with Citybus's Enviro500, but without wheelchair place and standees. They entered service in June 2009.

===North America===
[[File:Victoriadoubledecker.JPG|thumb|right|An Alexander Dennis Enviro500 owned by BC Transit]]
In 2004, Alexander Dennis started to explore the [[North America]]n market for its Enviro500. The American version of Enviro500 have modified bodies and redesigned fuel tanks, which enable the straight staircase to be moved forward. Alexander Dennis built four left hand drive Enviro500 (one 12m-long bus and three 12.8m-long bus) for demonstration in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

Bus operators which had evaluated the Enviro500 include [[Community Transit]] of [[Snohomish County, Washington]] (December 2005), [[Unitrans]] of [[Davis, California|Davis]] (January 2006, two weeks), [[OC Transpo]] of [[Ottawa]] (28 June to 12 July 2006 and February 2007), [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]] of [[San Francisco]] (November 2007 to January 2008)<ref>[http://www.sfmta.com/cms/apress/DoubleDeckerBusTrialSFMTAFactSheet.htm Double Decker Bus Trial SFMTA Fact Sheet]</ref> and the [[R<U+00E9>seau de transport de la Capitale]] of [[Quebec City]] (March 2013).

Alexander Dennis also built one 12-metre Enviro500 demonstrator for long-term loan. It was first loaned to [[Community Transit]] between 2007 and 2009 which put it into service on 1 August 2007, the bus was used on commuter routes between [[Seattle]] and various points in [[Snohomish County]] during its first year in operation.<ref>[http://www.commtrans.org/?mc=Newsandevents&subcat=10 Community Transit: Double Decker Bus]</ref> From September 2010, it was loaned to [[Strathcona County Transit]] on a one-year lease for the operator's one-year-long double-decker pilot project.<ref>[http://strathcona.ab.ca/departments/Transit/Double-Decker-Pilot-Project.aspx Double-decker Pilot Project :: Strathcona County]</ref> The pilot is part of an exploration of different high-capacity bus types to carry more passengers on the high-demand commuter routes, which are between [[Strathcona County]] and [[Edmonton]]; an articulated bus is also being evaluated as an alternative and there is no commitment to put any Alexander Dennis model or any double-decker design into permanent service. This bus becomes the first double-decker to be used for regular transit service in [[Alberta]].<ref>[http://strathcona.ab.ca/departments/Transit/6563.aspx Double-Decker FAQ :: Strathcona County]</ref>

In late 2008, Alexander Dennis announced the assembly of the American version of Enviro500 by [[ElDorado National]] of the United States.<ref name="USassembly" />

====Canada====
[[File:GO Transit double-decker bus.jpg|thumb|right|An Alexander Dennis Enviro500 owned by GO Transit]]
[[BC Transit]] ordered nine Enviro500 which were allocated to [[Victoria, British Columbia]] and entered service in early 2005. Two of them had taken part in a promotional show in USA, which was organized by Alexander Dennis in January 2005, before entering service. These were followed by another 26 which entered service in 2008; sixteen of them were allocated to Victoria and the other ten were allocated to [[Kelowna]]. In 2009, BC Transit received one Enviro500H for evaluation.

[[GO Transit]], Toronto's regional transit authority, has 22 12.8-metre long Enviro500s. Twelve were purchased in a C$10.835 million deal and they were introduced in early 2008. Ten extra units entered service in early 2009. Later it ordered 25 12.8-metre-long Enviro500s with new front and a lower height to met bridge clearance requirements in [[Ontario]], the first bus was delivered in April 3, 2013 and the remaining 24 in May 2013.<ref>http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2013/04/03/go_adds_new_doubledeckers_that_ride_a_bit_lower.html</ref>

[[OC Transpo]] also purchased 3 Enviro500s for further testing, after two trials in 2006/2007. The first unit arrived in November 2008 and the city of [[Ottawa]] operated them on a variety of routes. These three demo buses were sold to [[BC Transit]] in the summer of 2012. It ordered 75 12.8-metre-long Enviro500s with new front for delivery in 2012-13, the first one officially arriving on 23 August 2012.

[[File:Unitrans 8185 001.jpg|thumb|right|Enviro 500 of Unitrans]]
[[Gray Line Worldwide|Gray Line New York]], owned by [[Coach USA]] ordered 20 open-top Enviro500 for its [[sightseeing]] operations in [[New York City|New York]] and put them into service in spring 2005, these were the first open-top Enviro500 built (another 13 would later be ordered). Gray Line also received three single-door Enviro500 in summer 2005 for operation in [[San Francisco]].

Citizens Area Transit (now [[RTC Transit]]) of [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] had its first 50 Enviro500s enter service by October 2005. The service, marketed as "[[The Deuce]]", runs along the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Certain high-traffic routes, such as along Maryland Parkway and Nellis Boulevard, have also used these buses. They offer extra ventilation grilles outside the engine compartment to cope with Southern Nevada's dry desert climate and high summertime temperatures. Las Vegas's Enviro500s have the largest air conditioning system ever created for a transit vehicle, with eight fans fitted on the air conditioning unit. As of October 2006, CAT had firm orders for another 41 <!-- it is likely that one of them was ordered to replace the bus which was written off after an accident occurred on July 19, 2006 --> of the type worth $29.8 million; these were delivered in late 2007. A further 40 had also been ordered for delivery in 2008; these were 12.8 meters long and had a second staircase to speed loading and unloading. All these vehicles were used for regular fixed-route operations, ''not'' for sightseeing operations.

[[Les Cars Rouges]], a sightseeing company, ordered 16 open-top Enviro500 for sightseeing operations in the USA, delivery of these buses started in early 2007. Eight of the Enviro500 are destined for San Francisco, and the rest of them are destined for [[Washington D.C.]]

[[Community Transit]] currently has a fleet of 23 12.8m buses.<ref>[http://www.commtrans.org/projects/doubletall/ Community Transit : Double Tall Buses]</ref>

[[Unitrans]] (the student-run transit service of [[University of California, Davis]], known for years for its operation of former [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] double-decker buses) ordered two Enviro500 which were delivered in early 2010; these are the first batch of Enviro500s with the bodywork assembled by ElDorado National.

[[SLO Transit]] ordered one Enviro500 which entered service in late 2010.

===Enviro500 bodywork on Volvo B9TL chassis===
[[File:HK KMB Volvo B9TL NA8894.jpg|thumb|right|A Kowloon Motor Bus' Volvo B9TL with Enviro500 bodywork.]]
As of early 2009, [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] and [[Long Win Bus]] in Hong Kong and [[Dublin Bus]] of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are operating buses with this combination. For more details, see [[Volvo B9TL]].

==2012 "New Generation" Enviro500==
In 2012, Alexander Dennis unveiled a new generation Enviro500 with a new chassis design. The chassis (also known as the '''Trident E500 Turbo''' and '''E50D''') had the longitudinally-mounted engine and gearbox slightly offset to the left. The Cummins ISLe engine was retained, with choices of ZF EcoLife and Voith DIWA gearbox. Like the Enviro400 with straight staircase, the shape of fuel tank was specifically adopted to be mounted under the staircase. All the axles utilised were supplied by ZF instead of [[Dana Corporation|Dana]].

The bodywork followed the design of Hong Kong version-Enviro400, with a new design of staircase known by Alexander Dennis as the "Square-Case", which had similar size with spiral staircase but with all steps being rectangular shaped.

===Hong Kong===
====Citybus====
Citybus ordered one new generation Enviro500 in 2011 (together with the 115 older Enviro500), soon followed by another order of 155. 107 of these will be 12-metre-long version, including 66 with airport coach specification, and 49 will be 11.3-metre-long version.
