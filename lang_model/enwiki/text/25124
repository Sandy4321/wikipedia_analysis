In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Spes''' (pronounced {{IPA-la|<U+02C8>spe<U+02D0>s|}}) was the goddess of [[Hope (virtue)|hope]]. Multiple temples to Spes are known, and [[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|inscriptions]] indicate that she received private devotion as well as state cult.<ref>[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der r<U+00F6>mischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 837.</ref>

During the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], a temple to "ancient Hope" ''(Spes vetus)'' was supposed to have been located near the [[Porta Praenestina|Praenestine Gate]].<ref>[[Frontinus]], ''[[De aquaeductu]]'' 1.19; [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], "Religion in Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem in the First Century B.C.," in ''On Pagans, Jews, and Christians'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1987), p. 75.</ref> It was associated with events that occurred in the 5th century BC,<ref>[[Livy]] 2.51.2; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] 9.24.4; Momigliano, "Religion in Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem," p. 75.</ref> but its existence as anything except perhaps a private shrine has been doubted.<ref>Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 848.</ref>

A well-documented temple of Spes was built by [[Aulus Atilius Calatinus]]<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Legibus|De legibus]]'' 2.28; Momigliano, "Religion in Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem," p. 75.</ref> along with [[Fides (goddess)|Fides]], as the result of vows ''([[votum|vota]])'' made to these goddesses during the [[First Punic War]].<ref>Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 835.</ref>

At [[Capua]] in 110 BC, a temple was built to the triad of Spes, [[Fides (goddess)|Fides]], and [[Fortuna]].<ref>''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae]]'' 3770; Momigliano, "Religion in Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem," p. 75.</ref>

==Imperial Hope==
Spes was one of the divine personifications in the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] of the Virtues. Spes Augusta was Hope associated with the capacity of the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' to ensure blessed conditions.<ref>[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der r<U+00F6>mischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), pp. 812<U+2013>814.</ref>

Like [[Salus]] ("Salvation, Security"), [[Ops]] ("Abundance, Prosperity"), and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] ("Victory"), Spes was a power that had to come from the gods, in contrast to divine powers that resided within the individual such as [[Mens]] ("Intelligence"), [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]] ("Virtue"), and [[Fides (goddess)|Fides]] ("Faith, Fidelity, Trustworthiness").<ref>Fears, "The Theology of Victory at Rome," p. 744.</ref> 

==Greek Elpis==
The [[interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] of Spes was [[Elpis]], who by contrast had no formal [[Religion in ancient Greece|cult in Greece]]. The primary [[Greek mythology|myth]] in which Elpis plays a role is the story of [[Pandora]], and the Greeks had ambivalent or even negative feelings about "hope".<ref>Momigliano, "Religion in Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem," p. 75. For instance, in the ''Suppliants'' of [[Euripides]], Hope is characterized as "delusive; it has embroiled many a State" (line 479), as cited by Momigliano.</ref> The concept of hope was unimportant in the philosophical systems of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]].<ref>Momigliano, "Religion in Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem," p. 75.</ref>
