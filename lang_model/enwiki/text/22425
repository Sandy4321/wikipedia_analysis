'''Tatsu''' is a [[Steel roller coaster|steel]] [[flying roller coaster]] operating at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]], [[California]]. It opened May 13, 2006 after having to be delayed twice. The rides name, Tatsu, is from [[Japanese mythology]] and means ''[[Dragon]]'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Tatsu is also the world's tallest, fastest and longest flying coaster, is the only flying coaster to feature a zero-gravity roll, and has the world's highest pretzel loop. 

==History==
Tatsu was announced to the public on November 17, 2005.<ref>{{cite RCDB|coaster_name=Tatsu Announcement|location=Six Flags Magic Mountain|accessdate=January 12, 2013|url=http://rcdb.com/3305.htm?dt=126&d=197}}</ref> At the time, the original set opening date of the roller coaster was April 8, 2006. In early December of 2005 the media was invited to come to the park to see Tatsu's lift hill be topped (the highest piece of track of the lift hill being installed). As construction continued through the winter, due to several difficulties, construction was four weeks behind schedule. After crews tried to make-up for the four weeks lost, it was determined that Tatsu would not be able to open on April 8, now setting the new opening date three weeks later. Following the announcement of the delay, bad weather delayed construction another thriteen days. To make matters worse, when construction began on the pretzel loop (mid-march 2006), one of the footers was to large which restricted one of the track pieces from fitting into the footer correctly. In early April 2006, the final track piece was installed with some names of the construction workers printed on the track. However, through the track was now completed, construction was still behind schedule which resulted in the opening being delayed again to May 13, 2006. During the five weeks of testing, engineers noted that the trains were arriving back at the station eight seconds sooner then they should have been. Crews would change a few wheels, test the train, change a few more, test the train, and continue doing so until the train got the right speed. As it would turn out, it took three days of changing wheels to get the train to navigate the layout eight seconds slower. Finally, after over 900 test runs and 163 days of construction, Tatsu opened on May 13, 2006.<ref name=MB>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hm4nRzhYi8 |title=Mega Builders - Tatsu at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Part 1 of 2) |publisher=sm2tube (YouTube) |date=July 2, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name=MB2>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRr2LvEWtjE |title=Mega Builders - Tatsu at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Part 2 of 2) |publisher=sm2tube (YouTube) |date=July 2, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2013}}</ref>

==Ride Experience==

After the train has been moved into the horizontal position, depending on which station the train is in (Tatsu has two stations), after being dispatched from the station the train will either make a left or right s-bend towards the {{convert|170|ft|m|adj=on}} foot [[lift hill]]. Once at the top, the train makes a sharp {{convert|111|ft|m|adj=on}} downward right turn. After the train makes it to the bottom of the drop, the train makes an upward right turn leading into the first inversion, a {{convert|103|ft|m|adj=on}} tall [[Roller coaster elements#Corkscrew|corkscrew]]. Next, the train makes a downward left turn immediately followed by an upward left turn into a {{convert|96|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Roller coaster elements#Zero-gravity roll|zero-gravity roll]]. After the train exits the roll, it drops back down before going through a {{convert|84|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Roller coaster elements#Horseshoe|horseshoe]]. Following a left turn, the train then enters the record-breaking {{convert|124|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Roller coaster elements#Pretzel loop|pretzel loop]]. Upon exiting the pretzel loop, the train makes a slight left turn before going through an [[Roller coaster elements#Inline twist|inline twist]]. The train then makes a 135 degree downward right turn before rising back up slightly and going through the mid-course [[brake run]]. After exiting the brake run, the train a slight down and up left turn leading into the final brake run. The train then enters one of the two stations where the trains are put back into the vertical position for the riders to load and unload.<ref name=pov>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qFN-R0uJBI |title=Tatsu Front Row Seat on-ride POV Six Flags Magic Mountain |publisher=wwwCOASTERFORCEcom |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref><ref name=RCDB>{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Tatsu|location=Six Flags Magic Mountain|rcdb_number=3305|accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref>

==Promotions==
In 2006, [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Mega Builders]] aired an episode which followed the construction of Tatsu. The episode showed how the coaster was assembled and what problems construction crews had to overcome.<ref name=MB/><ref name=MB2/>

==Incidents==
On June 10, 2011, one of the maintenance workers suffered several cuts to his arm while working on the roller coaster. Six Flags Magic Mountain never released any other details.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gordan|first=Larry|title=Man injured on Six Flags Magic Mountain ride|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/06/man-injured-on-six-flags-magic-mountain-ride.html|accessdate=January 13, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 10, 2011}}</ref>
