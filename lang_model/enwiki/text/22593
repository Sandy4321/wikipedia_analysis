On May 1, 2010, [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]] mayor [[Peter Corroon]] asked Allen to be his [[running mate]] as lieutenant governor in his gubernatorial bid against incumbent Republican [[Governor of Utah|Governor]] [[Gary Herbert]]. As Corroon ran as a Democrat and Allen as a Republican, this was the first [[bipartisanship|bipartisan]] team on a single [[ticket (election)|ticket]] between major political parties in a Utah state election. In 1976, governor [[Scott M. Matheson]] and lieutenant governor [[David Smith Monson]] were elected from different parties, but on separate tickets. Political clashes between Matheson and Monson led to changes in state election law, requiring joint tickets in subsequent elections.<ref name="DeseretNews-20100504-picks" />

Corroon and Allen ran on a moderate ticket to appeal to [[independent (politician)|independent]] voters.<ref name="DeseretNews-20100504-picks" /> A major [[party platform|platform]] of their campaign was the improvement of education in the state of Utah.<ref name="StandardExaminer-20101007-focus">{{cite news|last=Tittensor|first=Annette|url=http://www.standard.net/topics/opinion/2010/10/07/improving-education-major-focus-corroon-allen|title=Improving education a major focus for Corroon, Allen|newspaper=[[Standard-Examiner]]|accessdate=October 12, 2010|date=October 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="DeseretNews-20100815-feedback">{{cite news|last=Farmer|first=Molly|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700055635/Peter-Corroon-seeks-feedback-crafts-education-platform.html|title=Peter Corroon seeks feedback, crafts education platform|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|pages=1<U+2013>2|accessdate=October 13, 2010|date=August 15, 2010}}</ref> Corroon's campaign accused Herbert's governorship of being "corrupt."
