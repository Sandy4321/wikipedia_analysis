'''SM ''U-69''''' was a [[German Type U 66 submarine|Type U 66]] [[submarine]] or [[U-boat]] for the [[German Imperial Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche Marine}}) during the [[World War I|First World War]]. She had been [[keel laying|laid down]] in February 1914 as '''''U-10''''' the fourth boat of the [[U-7 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-7'' class]] for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ({{lang-de|Kaiserliche und K<U+00F6>nigliche Kriegsmarine ''or'' K.u.K. Kriegsmarine}}) but was sold to Germany, along with the others in her class, in November 1914.

The submarine was ordered as ''U-10'' from [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] of [[Kiel]] as the first of five boats of the ''U-7'' class for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian Navy became convinced that none of the submarines of the class could be delivered to the [[Adriatic]] via [[Gibraltar]]. As a consequence, the entire class, including ''U-10'', was sold to the German Imperial Navy in November 1914. Under German control, the class became known as the U 66 type and the boats were renumbered; ''U-10'' became ''U-69'', and all were redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications. ''U-69'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed in June 1915 and [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed in September. As completed, she displaced {{convert|791|MT|ST}}, surfaced, and {{convert|933|MT|ST}}, submerged. The boat was {{convert|228|ft|m}} long and was armed with five torpedo tubes and a [[deck gun]].

As a part of the [[IV Flottille|4th Flotilla]], ''U-69'' sank 31 ships with a combined [[gross register tonnage]] of 102,875 in five war patrols. ''U-69'' left [[Emden]] on her sixth patrol on 9 July 1917 for operations off [[Ireland]]. On 11 July, ''U-69'' reported her position off [[Norway]] but neither she nor any of her crew were ever heard from again. British records say that ''U-69'' was sunk by destroyer {{HMS|Patriot}} on 12 July, but a German postwar study cast doubt on this. ''U-69''{{'}}s fate is officially unknown.

== Design and construction ==
After the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] had competitively evaluated three foreign submarine designs, it selected the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] 506d design, also known as the Type UD, for its new ''U-7'' class  of five submarines.<ref name=Con-340>Gardiner, p. 340.</ref> The Navy ordered five boats on 1 February 1913.<ref name=Con-343 />

The ''U-7'' class was seen by the Austro-Hungarian Navy as an improved version of its [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]], which was also a Germaniawerft design.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3''-class]] submarines, however, were less than half the displacement and nearly {{convert|90|ft|m}} shorter than the ''U-7'' design. See: Gardiner, pp. 342<U+2013>43.</ref> As designed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the boats were to [[displace (ship)|displace]] {{convert|695|MT|ST}} on the surface and {{convert|885|MT|ST}} while submerged. The [[hull (submarine)|doubled-hulled]] boats were to be {{convert|228|ft|m}} long ([[length overall|OA]]) with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20|ft|8|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m}}. The Austrian specifications called for two shafts with twin [[diesel engine]]s ({{convert|2300|bhp}} total) for surface running at up to {{convert|17|knots|km/h}}, and twin [[electric motor]]s ({{convert|1240|shp}} total) for a maximum of {{convert|11|knots|km/h}} when submerged.<ref name=Con-343 /> The boats were designed with five {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes; four located in the bow, one in the stern. The boats' armament was to also include a single 66<U+00A0>cm/26 (2.6<U+00A0>in) [[deck gun]].<ref name=Con-343 />

''U-10'' was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 7 February 1914,<ref name=U-69 /> and her construction was slated to be complete within 29 to 33 months.<ref name=Con-343 />

Neither ''U-10'' nor any of her [[sister boat]]s were complete when World War I began in August 1914.<ref name=allU66s>Helgason, Gu<U+00F0>mundur. [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=66 WWI U-boats: U 66], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=67 WWI U-boats: U 67], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=68 WWI U-boats: U 68], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=69 WWI U-boats: U 69], [http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=70 WWI U-boats: U 70]. ''U-Boat War in World War I''. Uboat.net. Retrieved on 9 December 2008.</ref> With the boats under construction at [[Kiel]], the Austrians became convinced that it would be impossible to take delivery of the boats, which would need to be towed into the Mediterranean past [[Gibraltar]], a British territory.<ref name=Con-343 /><ref group=Note>The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]'s Germaniawerft-built [[U-3 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-3'' class]] boats had been towed from [[Kiel]] to [[Pula|Pola]] via [[Gibraltar]] in 1909. See: Sieche, p. 19.</ref> As a result, ''U-10'' and her four sisters were sold to the [[Imperial German Navy]] on 28 November 1914.<ref name=Con-177 /><ref group=Note>In April 1915, just five months later, the German {{SMS|U-21||2|sub=y}} successfully entered the Mediterranean through the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], proving that delivery would have been possible after all. See: Gardiner, p. 343.</ref>

''U-10'' was renumbered by the Germans as ''U-69'' when her class was redesignated as the Type U 66.  The Imperial German Navy had the submarines redesigned and reconstructed to German standards, which increased the surface displacement by {{convert|96|MT|ST}} and the submerged by {{convert|48|MT|ST}}. The torpedo load was increased by a third, from 9 to 12, and the deck gun was upgraded from the {{convert|66|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun originally specified to an {{convert|88|mm|in|abbr=on}} one.<ref name=Con-177 />

== Service career ==
''U-69'' was [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 24 June 1915.<ref name=Con-177 /> On 4 September, SM ''U-69'' was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed into the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' under the command of ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' Ernst Wilhelms.<ref name=U-69 /> On 4 March 1916, ''U-69'' was assigned to the [[IV Flottille|IV. ''U-Halbflotille'']].<ref name=Tar-34>Tarrant, p. 34.</ref>

''U-69'' successfully completed five war patrols in which she sank 31 ships with a combined a total of {{GRT|102,875|first=yes}}. ''U-69''{{'}}s most successful month for number of ships sunk was April 1916, when she sank eight ships of 21,051 tons in a span of six days. The month with the highest tonnage sunk was June 1917 when she sank five ships of 28,808 tons in a nine-day span;<ref name=U69-ships>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Ships hit by U 69 | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/boats/successes/u69.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 9 December | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> nearly half of that total came from one ship, the 13,441-ton British [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{SS|Avenger||2}} sunk on 14 June west of the [[Shetland]]s.<ref name=Avenger>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Ships hit during WWI: Avenger | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/577.html | work = U-Boat War in World War I | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdaymonth = 9 December | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref>

''U-69'' began her sixth and final patrol on 9 July when she departed from [[Emden]], destined for operations off [[Ireland]]. ''U-69''{{'}}s position report at 02:30 on 11 July reported that she was {{convert|35|nmi|km}} south of [[Lindesnes]], [[Norway]], and was the last known contact with ''U-69''. According to author Dwight Messimer, two British sources report that {{HMS|Patriot||2}} sank ''U-69'' at position {{coord|60|25|N|1|32|E|display=inline}} on 12 July. An observer in a [[kite balloon]] deployed by ''Patriot'' spotted a surfaced U-boat at 07:00. The U-boat submerged and ''Patriot'' hunted the submarine until noon, when it loosed two [[depth charge]]s that brought thick brown oil to the surface. A postwar study by Germany cast doubt on whether or not the submarine attacked by ''Patriot'' was ''U-69''. Officially, her fate remains unknown.<ref name=Mess-88>Messimer, p. 88.</ref>
