'''Ottis Dewey Whitman, Jr.''' (born January 20, 1924), known professionally as '''Slim Whitman''', is an [[United States|American]] [[country music]] singer and songwriter. He is one of the best-selling and most influential artists in country music history and yet is one of the most unrecognized by the American public. 

His 1955 hit single "[[Rose Marie (song)|Rose Marie]]" held the record for the longest time at number 1 on the UK charts until [[Bryan Adams]] broke the record in 1992 after 37 years. In the U.S., his "[[Indian Love Call]]" (1952), and "[[Secret Love (1953 song)|Secret Love]]" (1953) reached number 2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country chart. Whitman had a string of minor hits from the mid 1960s into the early 80s, and became known th a new generation of fans through TV marketing in the 1980s.

Whitman lives today in [[Middleburg, Florida]].

==Biography==

Whitman was born in [[Tampa, Florida]] and sometimes shortened his name to O.D.  Growing up, he liked the country music of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] on the radio but did not embark on a musical career until the end of [[World War II]] after he had served in the South Pacific with the [[United States Navy]].

Whitman, a self-taught left-handed [[guitarist]], is right-handed, but lost almost all of the second finger on his left hand in an accident. He worked at a Tampa shipyard while developing a musical career, eventually performing with a band known as the Variety Rhythm Boys. Whitman's first big break came when agent [[Colonel Tom Parker]] heard him singing on the radio and offered to represent him. Signed with [[RCA Records]], he was billed as the cowboy singer, Slim Whitman, and released his first [[single (music)|single]] in 1948.  He toured and sang at a variety of venues including on the radio show, ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''.

He was not able to make a living from music and kept a part-time job. That changed in the early 1950s after he recorded a version of the [[Bob Nolan]] hit "Love Song of the Waterfall" that made it into the country music top 10. His next single, "[[Indian Love Call]]," was even more successful, reaching number 2. 

A [[yodeling|yodeler]], Whitman avoided the "down on yer luck-buried in booze" songs, preferring instead to sing laid-back romantic melodies about simple life and love.  Critics dubbed his style "countrypolitan," owing to its fusion of country music and a more sophisticated crooner vocal style.

In 1955, in the [[United Kingdom]], he had a [[List of Number 1 singles from the 1950s (UK)|No.1]] hit on the [[pop music]] charts with "Rose Marie".  With 11 weeks at the top of the UK charts, the song set a record that lasted for 36 years. Soon after, Whitman was invited to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]]; and in 1957, along with other musical stars, he appeared in the film musical, ''[[Jamboree (1957 film)|Jamboree]]''. Despite this exposure, he has never achieved the level of stardom in the United States that he did in Britain, where he had a number of other hits during the 1950s and 60s. Throughout the early 1970s, he continued to record and was a guest on [[Wolfman Jack|Wolfman Jack's]] television show, ''[[The Midnight Special (television)|The Midnight Special]]''. At the time, Whitman's recording efforts were yielding only minor hits and in 1974, he stopped making new records.

In 1979, Whitman filmed a TV commercial to support Suffolk Marketing's release of a greatest hits compilation, titled ''[[All My Best]]'', which went on to be the best-selling TV-marketed record in music history, with almost 1.5 million units sold. [[Just For You (Slim Whitman album)|''Just For You'']] (also under the Suffolk umbrella), followed in 1980, with a commercial that claimed Whitman "was number one in England longer than [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and [[Beatles|The Beatles]]". ''[[Slim Whitman The Best|The Best]]'' followed in 1982, with Whitman concluding his TV marketing with ''[[Best Loved Favorites]]'' in 1989, and ''[[20 Precious Memories]]'' in 1991. During this time he toured Europe and Australia with moderate success.

In late January 2008, a false rumor of his death spread through the Internet, believed to have been started by an erroneous report posted on the Web site of the ''[[Nashville Tennessean]]'' newspaper.[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012408/met_239455570.shtml] Country singer [[George Hamilton IV]] even dedicated and sang a hymn in Whitman's honor at a concert appearance.

In February 2009, his wife of 67 years, Geraldine (Jerry) Crist died. She was the daughter of the Rev. A.D. Crist. Whitman has a daughter, Sharon; and a son Byron Whitman, who is also a performer and has toured with Whitman.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/012408/met_239455570.shtml|title= Singer says rumors that he is dead aren't true|publisher= Jacksonville.com|date= January 24, 2008|accessdate= January 13, 2009}}</ref>

==Legacy==
For his contribution to the recording industry, Slim Whitman has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1709 Vine Street. He Whitman was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]]<U+2019>s Walkway of Stars in 1968.<ref>http://www.countrymusichalloffame.com/site/support-join-walkway-stars.aspx</ref>

Pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] cited Whitman as one of his ten favorite vocalists.<ref>Marsh, Dave and James Bernard, ''The New Book of Rock Lists''  (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1994), 362.</ref> Beatle [[George Harrison]] cites Whitman as an early influence: "The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman, either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television.  Guitars were definitely coming in."<ref>Harrison, George, ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]''  (New York: Chronicle Books, 2000), 28.</ref>

The 1977 film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' features Whitman's rendition of "[[Love Song of the Waterfall]]" playing in the toll booths as the cars speed through chasing three alien spaceships. The 1996 film ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' features Whitman's rendition of "[[Indian Love Call]]" as a weapon against alien invaders.  In 2003, [[Rob Zombie]] used Whitman's song [[I Remember You (1941 song)|"I Remember You"]] in his directorial debut ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''. In the 2007 film ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' Dewey mentions Whitman in response to his wife who asks him to name one musician who ever made any money.
