'''Daniel Raymond "Quiz" Quisenberry''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>kw<U+026A>z<U+0259>nb<U+025B>ri}}; [[February 7]] [[1953]] &ndash; [[September 30]] [[1998]]) was an [[United States|American]] right-handed [[relief pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played primarily for the [[Kansas City Royals]]. Notable for his [[Submarine (baseball)|submarine]]-style pitching delivery and his humorous quotes, he led the [[American League]] in [[save (sport)|saves]] a record five times (1980, 1982-85), and retired in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] with 244 saves, then the 6th-highest total in history behind [[Rollie Fingers]] (341), [[Rich Gossage|Rich "Goose" Gossage]] (307), [[Bruce Sutter]] (300), [[Jeff Reardon]] (287), and [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]] (265).

==Career==
Born in [[Santa Monica, California]], Quisenberry signed with the Royals as an amateur [[free agent]] in [[1975 in baseball|1975]], and was considered a marginal prospect. He made his major league debut with the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the middle of the [[1979 in baseball|1979]] season at the age of 26.  Quisenberry finished the season having appeared in 32 games and posting a 3-2 record with a 4.27 [[earned run average]] and 5 saves.

During spring training the following year, manager [[Jim Frey]] suggested that Quisenberry learn the submarine style delivery from [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] reliever [[Kent Tekulve]] to confuse hitters, because he could not overpower them. From [[1980 in baseball|1980]] to [[1985 in baseball|1985]], Quisenberry was the American League's dominant [[closer (baseball)|closer]], winning the [[Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award|Rolaids Relief Man Award]] in all but the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1981 in baseball|1981]] season, and finishing in the top five in voting for the Cy Young Award &mdash; again in all but 1981.

Quisenberry was hardly the prototypical closing pitcher. Unlike many of his peers, he didn't possess a hard [[fastball]], and thus had to rely on pinpoint control, guile, and deception, which his submarine delivery he first started using in 1980 augmented. His primary pitch was a [[sinker (baseball)|sinking fastball]], which causes hitters to hit the ball on the ground rather than in the air.  He also possessed a [[curveball]] in his repertoire, as well as a [[changeup]] he developed in 1984 <ref>The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers: An Historical Compendium of Pitching,Pitchers, and Pitches. Bill James and Rob Neyer. 2004.</ref> and an occasional knuckleball. Although Quisenberry was not a strikeout pitcher, he offset this deficiency by seldom walking batters or throwing [[wild pitch]]es. His 45 saves in 1983 was briefly a single season record (tied in 1984 by [[Bruce Sutter]] and broken in [[1986 in baseball|1986]] by [[Dave Righetti]]).  Quisenberry was the first pitcher in major league history to save more than 40 games in a season twice in his career.

In 1983, the Royals signed Quisenberry to a lifetime contract, similar to the contract of his teammate, [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]]. However, a rocky start in [[1988 in baseball|1988]] led to Quisenberry's relegation to middle relief and mop-up duty.  Shortly before the 1988 All-Star break, Quisenberry was released by the Royals.  Ten days later the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], managed by ex-Royals manager [[Whitey Herzog]], signed Quisenberry as a free agent.  After pitching for a year and a half in St. Louis, Quisenberry signed to play the [[1990 in baseball|1990 season]] with the [[San Francisco Giants]]. Quisenberry tore his [[rotator cuff]] just five appearances into the 1990 season, and was faced with serious injury for the first time in his career.  At the age of 37, after 12 seasons in the majors, Quisenberry retired.

In the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1996|1996 Hall of Fame Balloting]] by the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]], Quisenberry received 18 votes, just under the 24 vote (5%) cut-off to remain on the ballot. In the same election, [[Bruce Sutter]] &ndash; a pitcher with remarkably similar overall statistics &ndash; received 137 votes; he went on to be elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] in 2006.

Along with Sutter and [[Rich Gossage]], he was at the forefront of the transition from relief ace to the [[Tony La Russa|La Russian]] ninth inning [[closer (baseball)|closer]]. Quisenberry's [[Adjusted ERA+]] of 146 ties him for third all-time among qualifying pitchers.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/ERAplus_career.shtml "Career Leaders & Records for Adjusted ERA+"], ''Baseball-Reference.com''. Accessed [[July 25]] [[2007]].</ref> His career rate of [[Bases on balls per 9 innings pitched|walks per 9 innings pitched]] is the lowest since 1926.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/BBp9_career.shtml "Career Leaders & Records for Bases on Balls/9IP"], ''Baseball-Reference.com''. Accessed [[July 25]] [[2007]].</ref> In addition, Quisenberry accrued the 22nd most all-time in [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] shares.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/mvp_cya.shtml "MVP and CY Young Award Share Leaders"], ''Baseball-Reference.com''. Accessed [[July 25]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Post-career==
After his baseball career ended, Quisenberry embarked on a second career as a [[poetry|poet]], publishing three poems in [[1995 in literature|1995]] and a book of poetry titled ''On Days Like This'' in [[1998 in literature|1998]].

In [[1997#December|December 1997]], Quisenberry was diagnosed with [[brain cancer]]; he died in 1998 in [[Leawood, Kansas]].
