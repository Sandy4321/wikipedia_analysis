The '''Rh<U+00F6>n Mountains''' are a group of low mountains in central [[Germany]], located around the border area where the states of [[Hesse]], [[Bavaria]] and [[Thuringia]] come together. These mountains, which are at the extreme southeast end of the [[East Hesse Highlands]] (''Osthessisches Bergland''), are partly a result of ancient [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. They are separated from the [[Vogelsberg Mountains]] by the [[Fulda River]] and its valley. The highest mountain in the Rh<U+00F6>n is the [[Wasserkuppe]] (950.2 m) which is in [[Hesse]]. The Rh<U+00F6>n Mountains are a popular tourist destination and walking area.

==Origins==
[[Image:Rh<U+00F6>nlandschaft bei Tann.JPG|thumb|250px|Typical Rh<U+00F6>n landscape near [[Tann, Hesse]]]]
The name ''Rh<U+00F6>n'' is often thought to derive from the Celtic word ''raino'' (=hilly), but numerous other interpretations are also possible. Records of the monks at [[Fulda]] from the [[middle ages]] describe the area around Fulda as well as more distant parts of the Rh<U+00F6>n as ''[[Buchonia]]'', the land of ancient beech woods. In the Middle Ages beech was an important raw material. Large scale wood clearing resulted in the "land of open spaces" (''Land der offenen Fernen''), 30% of which, today, is forested.

==Geography==
===Location===
[[Image:Rh<U+00F6>nLage.png|thumb|right|Location of the Rh<U+00F6>n in Germany]]
[[Image:Rhoen Berge mg-k.jpg|thumb|250px|Landscape of central Rh<U+00F6>n.]]
Lying within the aforementioned states, the Rh<U+00F6>n is bounded by the [[Kn<U+00FC>ll]] to the northwest, the [[Thuringian Forest]] to the northeast, the [[Grabfeld]] to the southeast, [[Lower Franconia]] to the south, the [[Spessart]] forest to the southwest and the [[Vogelsberg mountains]] to the west.

===Division by type of volcanic activity===
Thanks to former volcanic activity the Rh<U+00F6>n can be divided into the ''[[Vorderer Rh<U+00F6>n]]'' (''Vorderrh<U+00F6>n'' or "Rh<U+00F6>n foothills"), the ''[[Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n]]'' (geographical region 353, "Kuppen Rh<U+00F6>n") and the ''[[Hohe Rh<U+00F6>n]]'' (354, "High Rh<U+00F6>n").

====Vorderrh<U+00F6>n and Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n====
The terms ''Vorderer Rh<U+00F6>n'' (''Vorderrh<U+00F6>n'') and ''Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n'' (''Kuppiger Rh<U+00F6>n'') are somewhat misleading, since the
''Vorderer Rh<U+00F6>n'' also consists mainly of ''Kuppen'' or low mountains with dome-shaped summits. The name has genuine historic origins: the ''Vorderer Rh<U+00F6>n'', as viewed from Thuringia, forms the foothills or "front" (''vorne'') of the mountain region.

In this gently rolling landscape numerous individual dome-shaped mountains rise on both sides of the border of Hesse and Thuringia and also, in some places, in Bavaria. These ''Kuppen'' are the remnants of former volcanos or volcanic

Five mountain regions may be distinguished:

* Vorderer Rh<U+00F6>n
* Auersberger Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n
* Soisberger Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n mit Hessischem Kegelspiel
* Milseburger Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n
* Br<U+00FC>ckenauer Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n

====Hohe Rh<U+00F6>n====
[[Image:Rhoen Schneetreiben mg-k.jpg|thumb|Winter in the Rh<U+00F6>n]]
The ''[[Hohe Rh<U+00F6>n]]'' (or ''Hochrh<U+00F6>n'') extends into all 3 states and is bounded by the ''Vorderer Rh<U+00F6>n'' in the northeast, the ''[[Grabfeld]]'' in the southeast, the ''[[Spessart]]'' in the southwest and the ''Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n'' in the northwest. It also has five main mountainous regions:

* Wasserkuppenrh<U+00F6>n
* Lange Rh<U+00F6>n
* Dammersfeldr<U+00FC>cken
* Kreuzberg-Gruppe
* Schwarze Berge

===Peaks===
[[Image:Rhoen Wasserkuppe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wasserkuppe]], highest point of Rh<U+00F6>n and [[Hesse]]]]

===Rivers===
The following rivers rise in the Rh<U+00F6>n Mountains or flow by or through them ''(length given in brackets)'':

* The [[Franconian Saale]] (''Fr<U+00E4>nkische Saale'') (142&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in [[Grabfeld]], passes the southeast Rh<U+00F6>n, flows southwest and into the River [[Main]] and therefore belongs to the catchment area of the River Rhine. The valley of the Franconian Saale in the area around [[Bad Neustadt an der Saale|Bad Neustadt]] forms part of the southeast border of the Rh<U+00F6>n with the Grabfeld.
** [[Streu River|Streu]] (40&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n on the southern slopes of the [[Ellenbogen]] and flows southwards into the Franconian Saale.
** The [[Brend River|Brend]] (30&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises at [[Oberwei<U+00DF>enbrunn]] in the Rh<U+00F6>n, flows  southeast into the Franconian Saale
** The [[Kellersbach]] (--km) <U+2013> rises from the numerous springs between Kreuzberg and the Black Mountains (Schwarzen Bergen) and takes a south-easterly course into the Franconian Saale
** The [[Thulba]] (31&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises on the Platzer Kuppe in the Rh<U+00F6>n and flows southwards into the Franconian Saale
** The [[Schondra]] (31&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n and heads south into the Franconian Saale
** The [[Sinn River|Sinn]] (50&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n near [[Wildflecken]] and flows southwards into the Franconian Saale

* The [[Fulda River|Fulda]] (218&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n on the [[Wasserkuppe]] and is the left headstream of the [[Weser]]. The valley of the Fulda in the area around the town of [[Fulda]] separates the Rh<U+00F6>n from the [[Vogelsberg Mountains]] to the west.
** The [[Haune]] (64&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n and flows north into the Fulda
** The [[L<U+00FC>tter]] (16&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises below the Wasserkuppe and flows westwards into the Fulda

* The [[Werra]] (298&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises on the boundary between the [[Thuringian Forest]] and the [[Thuringian Schiefergebirge|Schiefergebirge]], runs past the Rh<U+00F6>n to the northeast and flows northwards. It is the right headstream of the [[Weser]]. The valley of the Werra between [[Bad Salzungen]] and [[Wasungen]] separates the Rh<U+00F6>n from the Thuringian Forest to the east.
** The [[Herpf River|Herpf]] (22&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n and flows east into the Werra.
** The [[Ulster River|Ulster]] (56&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n and flows north into the Werra.
** The [[Felda (Thuringia)|Felda]] (40&nbsp;km) <U+2013> rises in the Rh<U+00F6>n and flows north into the Werra.

==History==
[[Image:Rhoenschaf mg-k.jpg|thumb|Rh<U+00F6>n sheep]]
The name ''Rh<U+00F6>n'' is believed to be of Celtic origin. Evidence of this is the Celtic settlement of [[Milseburg]] where there was a Celtic town with 1000 inhabitants. Furthermore there are circular embankments that could be both of Celtic and of Germanic origin in the ''Kuppenrh<U+00F6>n'' on the Stallberg and the Kleinberg mountains. Many names of places, mountains and meadows in the Rh<U+00F6>n have their origins in Celtic root words.

Up to the 10th century parts of the Rh<U+00F6>n belonged to [[Altgau]] [[Buchonia]]. This term was coined by the Romans in [[Late Antiquity]] and described an ancient beech forest in the Rh<U+00F6>n and the neighbouring low mountain ranges of the [[Spessart]] and [[Vogelsberg]]. Expansive stands of beech still exist today in the area.

Due to the outstanding field of view from the Rh<U+00F6>n mountains, they became sites for hilltop castles in the [[Middle Ages]]. One example is [[Hauneck Castle]] (''Burg Hauneck'') on the [[Stoppelsberg]], the ruins of which can still be seen. It served to oversee and protect traffic on the ancient road, the [[Antsanvia]], as well as protecting the villages in the Haune Valley.

In the Middle Ages the ''W<U+00FC>rzburg Defences'' (''Landwehr'') were erected on the ''Hochrh<U+00F6>n'' for the protection of its farmers.

==Biosphere Reserve==
{{main|Rh<U+00F6>n Biosphere Reserve}}
In 1991 [[UNESCO]] declared the Rh<U+00F6>n a [[Biosphere Reserve]] on account of its unique high-altitude ecosystem.

==Flora and fauna==
As a result of its geography and geology the Rh<U+00F6>n is an area with higher-than-average number of different [[habitats]] and [[species]]. But man, too, has generated valuable secondary habitats by creating a rich cultural landscape.

===Plant life===
[[Image:Rhoen Pulsatilla vulgaris Biotop mg-k.jpg|thumb|Meadows with masses of Pasque Flower (''[[Pulsatilla vulgaris]]'')]]
[[Image:Cypripedium calceolus 02 mg-k.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Lady's Slipper]] orchids (''[[C. calceolus]]'') in a pine forest]]
Compared with other low mountain regions, the Rh<U+00F6>n is particularly rich in plant varieties. Its natural vegetation would probably be dominated by [[beech]] woods with scattered groups of other trees, but today beech trees are very much in decline. A few of these ancient woods were identified as core elements of the Rh<U+00F6>n biosphere reserve. The higher beech woods are a habitat for rare, sometimes isolated, species of plant such as the [[Alpine Blue-sow-thistle]], [[Giant bellflower]] and [[Annual honesty]]. The vegetation of the lower-lying beech woods has a mix of mountain and other varieties. In addition to common wildflowers like the [[Martagon lily]], [[Lily of the Valley]], [[Wild Chervil]] and [[Ramson|Wild Garlic]], various [[orchids]] also flourish here including [[Cephalanthera]] orchids, the [[Yellow Coralroot]], [[Bird's-nest Orchid]], [[Lady's Slipper]] and [[Lady orchid]].

Only small areas of the Rh<U+00F6>n landscape are essentially open: the high-moor [[bog]]s, the rock outcrops and the [[stone runs]]. These habitats are home to highly-specialised species. The high-moor bogs of the ''Langen Rh<U+00F6>n'' - the [[Red Moor]] (''Rotes Moor'') and the [[Black Moor (marsh)|Black Moor]] (''Schwarzes Moor'') are floristically important important links between the northern and Alpine high moors. Here, for example, can be found [[sundew]]s, [[crowberry]] and [[cottongrass]]. Growing amongst the rocks of the volcanic mountains are rare species such as [[Cheddar Pink]], [[Sweet William Catchfly]], [[Oblong Woodsia]] and [[Fir Clubmoss]].

There are no naturally-occurring [[coniferous forest]]s in the Rh<U+00F6>n, but notable species of wild flower such as the [[Lady's Slipper|Lady's Slipper Orchid]], [[Creeping Lady's Tresses]] and [[Burning-bush]] are found in the forests of mixed pine.

The cultural landscape formed by mankind over the centuries also has a great variety of habitats and plants however, today, the extensive grassland areas are amongst the most threatened and heavily cultivated habitats. It is on the [[grassland|semi-arid grassland]]s and [[juniper]] heaths that the [[Silver Thistle]], symbol of the Rh<U+00F6>n region, grows, alongside [[gentian]]s, [[Pasque Flower]]s and [[Wood Anemone]]s, as well as orchids like the [[Early Purple Orchid|Early Purple]], [[Fragrant Orchid|Fragrant]] and [[Fly Orchid]]s. Rarer flowers include the various [[Bee orchid]]s and the [[Military Orchid|Military]], [[Lady orchid|Lady]], [[Burnt Orchid|Burnt]], [[Green-winged Orchid|Green-winged]], [[Man orchid|Man]], [[Pyramidal orchid|Pyramidal]], [[Frog Orchid|Frog]] and [[Lizard Orchid]]s. Along the southern fringes of the Rh<U+00F6>n, on the so-called slopes of steppe heathland (''Steppenheidenh<U+00E4>ngen'') grow warmth-loving plants such as [[White Rock-rose]], [[Erect Clematis]] and [[Honewort]].

Amongst the most valuable habitats in the Rh<U+00F6>n are the mountain meadows and fields of mat grass (''Nardetum strictae'') on the higher slopes<ref name="borstgrasrasen">Uwe Barth: ''[http://www.biosphaerenreservat-rhoen.de/dokumente/broschuere_borstgrasrasen1.pdf Natursch<U+00E4>tze der Rh<U+00F6>n: Borstgrasrasen.]'' LIFE-Projekt Rh<U+00F6>n der EU (Hrsg.), Kaltensundheim, 1997.</ref>. Characteristic plants here include the [[Monkshood]], [[Northern Wolfsbane]], [[Common Moonwort]], [[Martagon Lily]], [[Greater Butterfly Orchid]], [[Perennial Cornflower]] and [[Wig Knapweed]].

[[Bog-bean]], [[Grass of Parnassus]]' [[Western Marsh Orchid]] and [[Lousewort]] are found in the wet meadows and low marshes; and the extremely rare [[Large Brown Clover]], [[Hairy Stonecrop]] and [[Pyrenean scurvygrass]] in the springwater marshes of the ''Hohe Rh<U+00F6>n''.

===Wildlife===

The wildlife in the Rh<U+00F6>n mountains is similar to that of other low mountain ranges, but there are also some unusual species. In addition to the more common mammals such as [[roe deer]], [[fox]], [[European Badger|badger]], [[European hare|hare]] and [[wild boar]], there are also smaller mammals such as the [[Hazel Dormouse|dormouse]], common [[Eurasian water shrew|water shrew]] and [[Mediterranean Water Shrew|Miller's water shrew]]. One unusual regional species is the [[alpine shrew]]. Birds occurring here include the [[black grouse]], the [[capercaillie]], the [[black stork]], the [[eagle owl]], the [[corncrake]], the [[red-backed shrike]] and the [[wryneck]]. There are also two species [[endemism|endemic]] to the Rh<U+00F6>n: the [[rove beetle]] and a local snail, the ''Rh<U+00F6>nquellschnecke'' ([[Bythinella compressa]]).

==Rh<U+00F6>n umbrella brand==

The ''Dachmarke Rh<U+00F6>n'' project (Rh<U+00F6>n umbrella brand project) is run by the Rh<U+00F6>n working group and its aim is to promote a common identity for the Rh<U+00F6>n region and to present a unified view of the area to the outside world and to harmonise the marketing measures of the three participating federal states.
