The '''Gypsy Restaurant and Velvet Lounge''' was a restaurant and [[nightclub]] established in 1947 and located along Northwest 21st Avenue in the [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest District]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. Popular with young adults, the restaurant was known for serving fishbowl alcoholic beverages, for its 1950s furnishings, and for hosting [[karaoke]], trivia competitions and [[goldfish]] racing tournaments. The restaurant is said to have influenced local alcohol policies; noise complaints and signs of drunken behavior by patrons made the business a target for curfews and closure. Concept Entertainment owned the restaurant from 1992 until 2014, when it was closed unexpectedly.

==Reception==
In 2009, ''The NW Examiner'' included Gypsy in an article about happy hours in Northwest Portland. In her review, Desiree Andrews wrote that the fried artichoke hearts and pub chips were forgettable and recommended the black bean quesadilla. She said, "Overall, the atmosphere was a little too much like a ''Big Lebowski'' hallucination for me, and the food triggered clogged-artery images, but the friendliness of the staff made up for a lot."<ref name=Andrews>{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Desiree|title=Happy Hour Hits|journal=The NW Examiner|date=August 2009|volume=23|issue=12|page=19|url=http://nwexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8August2009.pdf|accessdate=December 12, 2014|format=PDF}}</ref>
