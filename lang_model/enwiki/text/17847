The '''Action of 1 August 1801''' was a [[list of single-ship actions|single-ship action]] of the [[First Barbary War]] fought between the American [[schooner]] {{USS|Enterprise|1799|6}} and the Tripolitan [[polacca]] ''Tripoli'' off the coast of modern-day [[Libya]].

As part of Commodore [[Richard Dale]]'s [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]], ''Enterprise'' had been deployed with the American force [[blockade|blockading]] the [[Tripolitania Province, Ottoman Empire|Vilayet of Tripoli]]. ''Enterprise'', under the command of Lieutenant [[Andrew Sterett]], had been sent by Commodore Dale to gather supplies at [[Malta]]. While cruising towards Malta, ''Enterprise'' engaged the ''Tripoli'', commanded by Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous. ''Tripoli'' put up a stubborn fight, and the engagement lasted for three hours before the polacca was finally captured by the Americans.

Although the Americans had taken the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take [[Prize (law)|prizes]] and so was obliged to release her. ''Enterprise'' completed her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted [[morale]] in the United States, since it was that country's first victory in the war against the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of ''Tripoli''{{'s}} defeat. Despite ''Enterprise''{{'s}} triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.

==Background==
Following the recognition of the independence of the United States (USA) in 1783, the new country's early administrations had elected to make [[tribute]] payments to the [[Tripolitania Province, Ottoman Empire|Vilayet of Tripoli]] to protect American commercial shipping interests in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Tripoli, nominally a subject of the [[Ottoman Empire]], was practically autonomous in conducting her foreign affairs, and would declare war on non-Muslim states whose ships sailed in the Mediterranean in order to extract tribute from them.  In 1801, the payments demanded by Tripoli from the United States were significantly increased. The newly elected administration of [[Thomas Jefferson]], an opponent of the tribute payments from their inception, refused to pay.<ref>Allen 1905, p. 91</ref> As a result, Tripoli declared war on the United States, and its navy began to seize American ships and crews in an attempt to coerce the Jefferson administration into acceding to their demands.  When word of these attacks on American [[Merchant vessel|merchantmen]] reached [[Washington, D.C.]], the Jefferson administration gave the [[United States Navy]] the authority to conduct [[Limited war|limited operations]] against Tripoli. As part of the American strategy, a squadron under Commodore [[Richard Dale]] was dispatched to [[blockade]] Tripoli.<ref>Boot 2002, p. 13.</ref>

By July 1801, Dale's force had begun to run low on water. In order to replenish his supplies, Dale dispatched the schooner USS ''Enterprise'', commanded by Lieutenant Andrew Sterett, to provision at the British naval base on [[Malta]], while the commodore himself remained off Tripoli with the [[frigate]] {{USS|President|1800|6}} to maintain the blockade. Soon after leaving the blockade, ''Enterprise'' came upon what appeared to be a Tripolitan [[corsair]] cruising near her. [[false flag|Flying British colors as a ruse]], the ''Enterprise'' approached the Tripolitan vessel and hailed her. The Tripolitan answered that she was seeking American vessels. At this the ''Enterprise'' struck the British colors, raised the American flag, and prepared for action.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes>Fremont-Barnes 2002, p. 40.</ref>

The Tripolitan vessel, ''Tripoli'', and the ''Enterprise'' were quite evenly matched. ''Enterprise'', with a complement of 90, was a 12-gun, 135-ton schooner built in 1799 that had seen action in the [[Quasi-War]].<ref>Dobbs 2005, p. 138.</ref> In contrast, ''Tripoli'', a [[lateen]]-rigged [[polacca]] with two masts, was crewed by 80&nbsp;men under Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous and armed with 14&nbsp;guns.<ref>Smethurst 2006, p. 81.</ref> Although the Tripolitans held a slight advantage in firepower, ''Enterprise'' had to its advantage the larger crew and the element of surprise.  The Americans were also significantly more experienced in gunnery action than the Tripolitans, who preferred to attack by [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] and taking over their opponents' ships.<ref name=Whipple,79/>

==Battle==

Shortly after Sterett had the American colors raised, he had his men open fire upon the Tripolitans at close range with [[musket]]s. In response, ''Tripoli'' returned fire with an ineffective [[broadside]].<ref>Wheelan 2003, p. xix.</ref> The Americans returned fire with their own broadsides, which led Rous to break off the engagement and attempt to flee. Neither able to fight off the American vessel nor outrun her, the Tripolitans attempted to [[Grappling hook|grapple]] ''Enterprise'' and board her. Once within musket range, ''Enterprise''{{'s}} marines opened fire on the ''Tripoli'', foiling its boarding attempt, and forced ''Tripoli'' to try to break away once more. ''Enterprise'' continued the engagement, firing more broadsides into the Tripolitan and blasting a hole in her hull.<ref name=Whipple,80>Whipple 1991, p. 80.</ref>

Severely damaged, ''Tripoli'' [[struck her colors]] to indicate surrender. As ''Enterprise'' moved towards the vessel to accept its surrender, the Tripolitans hoisted their flag and fired upon ''Enterprise''. The Tripolitans again attempted to board the American schooner, but were repelled by ''Enterprise''{{'s}} broadsides and musketry. After another exchange of fire, the Tripolitans struck their colors a second time. Sterett once more ceased firing and moved closer to ''Tripoli''.<ref>Wheelan 2003, p. xx.</ref> In response, Rous again raised his colors and attempted to board ''Enterprise''. ''Enterprise''{{'s}} accurate gunnery once more forced ''Tripoli'' to veer off. As the action continued, Rous [[perfidy|perfidiously]] feigned a third surrender in an attempt to draw the American schooner within grappling range. This time, Sterett kept his distance, and ordered ''Enterprise''{{'s}} guns to be lowered to aim at the polacca's waterline, a tactic that threatened to sink the enemy ship. The next American broadsides struck their target, causing massive damage, dismasting her [[mizzen-mast]], and reducing her to a sinking condition.<ref>Allen 1905, p. 96.</ref> With most of his crew dead or wounded, the injured Admiral Rous finally threw the Tripolitan flag into the sea to convince Sterett to end the action.<ref name=Whipple,80/>

==Aftermath==
At the end of the action ''Tripoli'' was severely damaged; 30&nbsp;of her crew were dead and another 30&nbsp;were injured. The polacca's first lieutenant was among the [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] and Admiral Rous himself was injured in the fighting. In what amounted to a total American victory over the Tripolitans, ''Enterprise'' had suffered only superficial damage and no casualties.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/>  Sterett, whose orders did not give him the authority to retain [[prize (law)|prize]]s, let the polacca limp back to Tripoli. However, before setting her free, the Americans cut down ''Tripoli''{{'s}} masts and sufficiently disabled her so that she could barely make sail. Sterett then continued his journey to Malta and picked up the supplies for which he was sent before returning to the blockade.<ref name=Whipple,80/>

After ''Enterprise'' left, ''Tripoli'' began its journey back to the port of Tripoli. On the way it ran into [[USS President (1800)|USS ''President'']] and asked for assistance; Rous falsely claimed that his vessel was [[Tunis]]ian and that it had been damaged in an engagement with a French 22-gun vessel.<ref>Wheelan 2003, p. 118.</ref> Dale suspected the vessel's true identity and merely provided Rous with a compass so he could find his way back to port. When he finally arrived at Tripoli, Rous was severely chastised by [[Yusuf Karamanli]], the [[Pasha]] (ruler) of Tripoli. Stripped of his command, he was paraded through the streets draped in sheep's entrails while seated backwards on a [[donkey|jackass]] before suffering 500 [[bastinadoes]].<ref>Boot 2002, p. 14.</ref>

''Enterprise''{{'s}} victory over ''Tripoli'' had very different consequences for the two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for ships' crews.<ref>Allen 1905, p. 97.</ref> In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of ''Enterprise''{{'s}} crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory did not have any long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under [[Richard Valentine Morris|Richard Morris]],<ref>Wheelan 2003, p. 119.</ref> and [[First Barbary War|the war]] continued until 1805.
