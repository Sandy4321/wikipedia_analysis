'''Sunday football in Northern Ireland''' has been a controversial issue. Until 2008, the [[Irish Football Association]] (IFA) under IFA Article 27,<ref name=money>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballymoneytimes.co.uk/news/local-news/sunday-football-game-expected-to-be-probed-by-ifa-1-1813818 |title=Sunday football game expected to be probed by IFA |work=Ballymoney Times |date=2005-03-03 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> prohibited any clubs affiliated with them from playing [[association football]] matches on Sunday. The ban initially came from Northern Ireland's [[Protestant]] Christian majority's observance of Sunday as the [[Sabbath]] (a day of rest), but was also a way to combat a perceived encroachment on their culture by [[Catholic Church|Catholics]].<ref>{{cite book | first =Lucy | last =Delap  | title =Men, Masculinities and Religious Change in Twentieth-Century Britain | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan| edition =   | year = 2013| isbn = 1137281758 |page=243 }}</ref> Since the abolition of the ban, teams can play matches on Sunday if they have mutual agreement, although some teams such as [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] have club rules against such games.

The [[Northern Ireland national football team]] also had a policy of not playing on Sundays. This policy was later amended to allow Northern Ireland to play on Sundays away from home before being unofficially suspended due to changes in [[UEFA]] rules regarding playing dates for international competition qualifiers. On 29 March 2015, the national team played their first home match on a Sunday against [[Finland national football team|Finland]].

==History==
Prior to the 1930s, the IFA had no official ban on Sunday football however unofficially no matches were scheduled on Sundays. In 1898, the [[Leinster Football Association]] requested permission for matches on Sunday, which was unanimously rejected by the IFA as "very detrimental to the interests of the game". In 1901, the [[Munster Football Association]] made a similar request which was also turned down.<ref>Garnham, 166</ref> It is not known when the official ban on Sunday football was instituted but it is known that it was created in the 1930s.<ref name=nl>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/ifa-lifts-60-year-ban-on-sunday-football-1-1861516 |title=IFA lifts 60-year ban on Sunday football |publisher=Newsletter |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref><ref name=beck>{{cite book | first =Peter J. | last =Beck  | title =Scoring for Britain: International Football and International Politics, 1900-1939 | publisher = Routledge| edition =   | year = 2013| isbn = 1135230307 | page = 133}}</ref> It is also not known why the ban was introduced but it is known that the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] deciding to play games on Sundays and the [[British Unionism|unionist]] IFA felt that this was an encroachment on their "soccer territory".<ref>Garnham, 30-31</ref> It has been stated by historians that it might also have been due to strict [[Protestant]] [[First day Sabbatarianism|sabbatarianism]] that led to the ban. When the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI) broke away from the IFA in 1921 following allegations of the IFA having an alleged bias in favour of [[Belfast]] clubs, one of their first actions was to permit football being played on Sunday under their jurisdiction.<ref>Garnham, 192</ref> While the IFA maintained a ban on Sunday football for all senior and junior men's football,<ref name=money /> the [[Northern Ireland Women's Football Association]] (NIWFA) played their [[women's association football|women's football]] matches on Sundays as they were initially independent of the IFA.<ref name=niwfa>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/4599209.stm |title=Sunday football plan turned down |publisher=BBC sport |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref>

==Effect==
The IFA ban on football on Sundays was strictly enforced so that no club affiliated with the IFA could play football in Northern Ireland on Sundays. This included the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] who also refused to play international matches on Sunday.<ref name=beck /> Before the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], it was noted that Northern Ireland would play [[France national football team|France]] on a Sunday. As a result, the IFA relaxed their Sunday football ban to permit the Northern Ireland national team to play football on Sundays outside of Northern Ireland. As a result of this, one Christian member of the Northern Ireland team refused to play in that match because it was on Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cromie |first=Claire |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/euro-2016-northern-ireland-to-play-first-ever-sunday-international-at-windsor-park-30034663.html |title=Euro 2016: Northern Ireland to play first ever Sunday international at Windsor Park |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=2014-02-23 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> In 2001, [[Cliftonville F.C.|Cliftonville]] attempted to play a friendly match against [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]], who are based in [[County Londonderry]] but are affiliated with the FAI, on a Sunday. The IFA initially permitted this however the match was cancelled after complaints from the [[North West of Ireland Football Association]] despite Cliftonville arguing that since Derry City organized it, it was outside of the IFA's jurisdiction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-77122177.html |title=Reds Hit-Out at Double Standard IFA |publisher=The People |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=2001-08-12 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref>

==Abolition of ban==
Towards the start of the 21st century, several clubs made moves to abolish the ban on Sunday football in Northern Ireland. In 2000 [[Newry City F.C.|Newry Town]] put forward a motion to play football on Sunday on commercial grounds. However, it was rejected by the IFA overwhelmingly on moral grounds despite Newry Town stating they "do not wish to impinge on anyone's Christian or moral ethics."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62379137.html |title=Never on a Sunday say IFA delegates |publisher=Newsletter |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=2000-05-31 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> In 2003, [[Cliftonville F.C.|Cliftonville]] started a campaign to permit Sunday football if both clubs consented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/2910651.stm |title=End of Sunday ban is proposed |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2003-04-02 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> In 2005, [[Armagh City F.C.|Armagh City]] and  [[Ballynure Old Boys F.C.|Ballynure Old Boys]] made a similar request to play on Sundays. Again the IFA rejected it on the grounds that it would interfere with the NIWFA's fixtures.<ref name=niwfa /> A year later, the request was made again and members of the IFA voted in favour of it 69-28 however they failed to reach a 75% majority needed due to the NIWFA's clubs voting against it and thus the Sunday football ban remained in place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/5108834.stm |title=Sunday soccer ban stays in place |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-06-23 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> Maintaining the ban meant that Northern Ireland was the only country in [[UEFA]] which had a ban on Sunday football. This decision was criticized in the media who viewed the ban as outdated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147769507.html |title=The Fact the IFA Remains the Only Association in Europe against Sunday Football Should Embarrass Us All |work=The Mirror |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=2006-07-04 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> [[Howard Wells]], the IFA chief executive took legal advice after it was suggested that the ban on Sunday football might not be supported in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] if a lawsuit was brought against them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133342010.html |title=IFA Chief Seeks Legal Guidance |publisher=Newsletter |date=2005-06-15 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> After the failure of the 2006 motion, the predicted legal challenge, supported by the [[Equality Commission]] did emerge on the grounds of religious discrimination.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-147358856.html |title=IFA Face a Challenge over Vote |work=The Mirror |date=2006-06-23 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5130662.stm |title=Civil bill is served on the IFA |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2006-06-29 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref>

[[File:Windsor Park football stadium - Empty.JPG|thumb|[[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], owners of [[Windsor Park]], have it written in their constitution that the team can not play there on a Sunday]]
In 2007, despite opposition from the [[Democratic Unionist Party]], the IFA voted 91-14 to remove IFA Article 27 from their constitution.<ref>{{cite web|author=Henry McDonald |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/nov/30/northernireland.ireland |title=Irish FA scraps 60-year-old ban on Sunday matches |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> It was replaced by IFA Article 36.b which stated that no football would be scheduled on Sunday but matches on Sunday could be played if both teams and the organizing competition agreed. It also stated that no player or club could be punished if they refused to play on Sunday.<ref>{{cite paper|url=http://www.irishfa.com/fs/doc/ffa-forms/Football_Regulations_as_passed_June_2014.pdf |title=Football Regulations as passed June 2014 |publisher=Irish Football Association |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> The ban on Sunday football in Northern Ireland was lifted on 1 June 2008.<ref name=nl /> The first match held on Sunday since the ban was lifted was an [[NIFL Premiership|Irish Premiership]] match between [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] and [[Bangor F.C.|Bangor]] at [[The Oval (Belfast)|The Oval]]. Before the match there was a protest against the match by members of the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster]] led by Reverend David McIlveen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7603230.stm |title=Football 1, Religion 1 |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-09-07 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> Despite the lifting of the ban on Sunday football, Article 36.b has been used very rarely.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beacom |first=Stephen |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/should-northern-ireland-play-sunday-football-at-windsor-park-29575530.html |title=Should Northern Ireland play Sunday football at Windsor Park? |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref>

Some clubs maintain a club ban on Sunday football. [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]], the owners of [[Windsor Park]] used as the home ground of the Northern Ireland national team, had it written in their club rules in Article 24 that no games would be permitted on their grounds on Sundays. Since this could have prevented Windsor Park hosting cup finals or international matches, Linfield members voted to change Article 24 to state that no games involving Linfield could take place at Windsor Park on Sundays.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16327449.html |title=Blues allow Sunday football at Windsor |work=The Belfast Telegraph |subscription=yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> [[Ballymena United F.C.|Ballymena United]] decided to play a friendly tournament in the [[Republic of Ireland]] on a Sunday. As a result, one of their sponsors pulled out of the club.<ref>{{cite web|last=McNeilly |first=Claire |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/sponsor-pulls-out-as-ballymena-united-plays-sunday-football-28762503.html |title=Sponsor pulls out as Ballymena United plays Sunday football |work=The Belfast Telegraph |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref>

Despite the scrapping of the ban on Sunday football, the Northern Ireland national team continued to negotiate the fixture dates of friendlies and international competition qualifiers so that they were not on Sundays. In 2014, UEFA changed the match date allocation for qualifying competitions from mutual agreement between nations to randomly selected dates from a computer. The IFA were informed this might mean matches on Sunday and they signed in agreement prior to the draw for [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26315890 |title=Northern Ireland set for first Sunday Windsor Park game |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2014-02-23 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref> When the draw was made, it was determined that Northern Ireland would play [[Finland national football team|Finland]] at home on 29 March 2015 in Northern Ireland's first international match at home on Sunday. Political party, [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] questioned this but the IFA replied that they had no control over it but accepted that some fans might boycott the match because it was on a Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/ifa-had-no-say-in-first-ever-sunday-home-game-1-5896791 |title=IFA <U+2018>had no say<U+2019> in first ever Sunday home game |publisher=Newsletter |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}</ref>
