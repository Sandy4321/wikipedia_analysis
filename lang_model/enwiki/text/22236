Blackburn's car, along with his body, were found four days after the eruption.<ref name=TC/> His camera, buried under the debris of the eruption, was found roughly one week later.<ref name=camera/>

After his death, Reid was praised by his coworkers and friends alike. They spoke of his talent and enthusiasm, as well as his sometimes "acerbic" sense of humor.<ref name=SDC/> His wife, Fay, concluded that he had died doing what he loved.<ref name=SR/>

== Life ==
Blackburn was born in 1952,<ref name=Ryll_2005/> the son of an [[engineer]] who possessed "a fixation on figuring out the way things worked".<ref name=TC/> He loved the idea of [[photography]], once equating it to "painting with light".<ref name=TC/> He was an accomplished photographer, and had received accolades from the [[Associated Press]] for his photographs. Blackburn also authored a book on [[outboard motor|outboard]] [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplane]] racing.<ref name=SDC>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NtMvAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PPkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5889,2305911|title=We Ache, for Reid Was One of Us|author=Koenninger, Tom|work=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|date=May 23, 1980|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>

Blackburn attended [[Linfield College]] in Oregon.<ref name=RBS/> He began working at ''The Columbian'' newspaper in 1975 as a photojournalist.<ref name=RBS/> It was there that he met his wife, Fay Mall, who worked in the newspaper's display advertising department. The two dated for several months before marrying in the summer of 1979. Blackburn enjoyed hiking and loved [[Outdoor recreation|the outdoors]].<ref name=TC>{{cite news|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2010/apr/01/victims-volcanos-toll-hits-home|title=Volcano<U+2019>s toll hits close to home|author=Robinson, Erik|date=April 1, 2010|accessdate=May 20, 2011|work=The Colombian}}</ref>

== Assignment at Mount St. Helens ==
According to coworker and photo editor Steve Small, St. Helens was Blackburn's favorite mountain. They climbed it together several times, and referred to it as "the Sleeping Beauty of the Northwest."<ref name=ERG/>

Blackburn first became interested in the possibility of an eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when a series of earthquakes rocked the volcano.<ref name=TC/> Having already climbed the mountain, he was intrigued by the situation<ref name=TC/> and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the volcano for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the volcano as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for ''The Columbian'', National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.<ref name=ERG/>

Despite being assigned to stay on the mountain only until May 17, Blackburn opted to stay a few more days.<ref name=TC/> Blackburn was situated near Coldwater Creek, {{convert|8|mi|km|0|sp=us}} from the volcano, on the day of the eruption.<ref name=TC/> 

Early on May 18, an earthquake measuring 5.1 on the [[Richter scale]] struck the region, creating a massive [[landslide]] - {{convert|0.6|cumi|km3|0|sp=us}} of rock that released pressure on the volcano's crater, causing an ejection of steam. Just seconds later, Mount St. Helens [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted]] laterally (from its side), sending [[supersonic]] [[pyroclastic flow]]s (very hot clouds of gas and volcanic ash) into the forest below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/May18/description_may18_1980.html|date=May 28, 2005|title=Description: May 18, 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}</ref>

== Death ==
Blackburn was killed when a [[pyroclastic flow]] enveloped the area where he was camped out. His car was found four days later,<ref name=TC/> surrounded up to the windows in ash<ref name=MG/> with his body inside.<ref name=TCH>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z4suAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zocFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1448,922010|title=Death Was Instantaneous for Volcano's Victims|date=May 29, 1980|accessdate=May 22, 2011|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|work=[[Tri-City Herald]]}}</ref> The windows had been broken and ash filled the interior of the vehicle.<ref name=MG>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZH4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c6QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1533,3422233|title=Volcano Dead "Suffocated in Ash"|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=May 27, 1980|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>

In early June, National Geographic photographer Fred Stocker recovered Blackburn's camera from debris {{convert|2.5|ft|m|0|sp=us}} thick. The film was not salvageable as the intense heat from the eruption had corrupted the pictures.<ref name=camera>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0VZOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OfkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2330,1530433|title=Much-sought Camera Found, Film Ruined|date=June 5, 1980|accessdate=May 22, 2011|publisher=[[Cowles Publishing Company]]|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]}}</ref>

The 1980 event was the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the history of the United States. A total of 57 people are known to have died, and more were left homeless when the ash falls and pyroclastic flows destroyed or buried 200 houses. In addition to Blackburn, notable resident [[Harry Randall Truman]] and volcanologist [[David A. Johnston|David Alexander Johnston]] were killed.<ref name=1980eruption>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/MSHPPF/MSH_past_present_future.html|title=Report: Eruptions of Mount St. Helens: Past, Present, and Future|author=Topinka, Lyn|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=December 27, 2006|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
After his death, friends and coworkers of Blackburn came forward to compliment his pleasant character and his talent. Friends described Blackburn as having "an impishness his friends came to expect."<ref name=TC/> Coworker Mike Prager called Reid "one of the funniest and most talented journalists in the Pacific Northwest" who "made his job look easy, he was that good."<ref name=SR>{{cite news|url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/tools/story_pf.asp?ID=30799|title=Volcano's activity a painful reminder|author=Prager, Mike|work=[[Spokesman-Review]]|date=October 8, 2004|accessdate=May 20, 2011}}</ref> Tom Koenninger, editor of ''The Columbian'', described Blackburn's humor as "wry" and sometimes "acerbic", but elaborated that Blackburn was "gentle, displaying aggression when it was necessary for him to get close to a subject he was photographing."<ref name=SDC/> Commenting on her husband's dedication to photography, Fay Blackburn remarked, "if Reid were alive today, he'd probably be back on the front line seeking to capture the latest chapter in the mountain's evolution, in spite of the risk." "Reid loved that mountain. He climbed it, hiked it, skied it." She added that he died doing what he loved.<ref name=SR/>

The National Press Photographers Association awards a competitive [[scholarship]] annually in Blackburn's honor,<ref name=RBS>{{cite web | title = Reid Blackburn Scholarship| work = National Press Photographers Association| url = http://www.nppa.org/professional_development/students/scholarships/blackburn.html | accessdate = May 22, 2007}}</ref> worth $2000.<ref name=RBS/> In 2005 ''The Columbian'' offered an internship to applicants for the scholarship in memory of Blackburn.<ref name=RBS/>
