This is a '''list of the Presidents and [[Governor of Delaware|Governors]] of the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Delaware]].''' 

The Governor serves as head of the [[executive (government) |executive branch]] of the state's government, and was called ''President'' under the [[Delaware Constitution of 1776]]. With the [[Delaware Constitution of 1792]] the name was changed to conform to usage in the rest of the U.S. states. The Presidents were particularly weak executive officials, being elected by the [[Delaware General Assembly]], having no legislative veto, ineligible for immediate reelection, and whose actions required the approval of an executive ''Privy Council''. Starting in [[1792]] the Governor was popularly elected and the ''Privy Council'' was abolished, but it wasn't until [[1897]] that a legislative veto or election to a second term was possible. As a result, the office was part time and largely ceremonial until the mid twentieth century.

==List of Governors==

===Presidents under the Constitution of 1776===
The [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] chose the State [[Governor of Delaware |President]] for a term of three years.
