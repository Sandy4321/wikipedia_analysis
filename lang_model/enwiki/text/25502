'''Operation Medak Pocket''' ({{lang-hr|Meda<U+010D>ki d<U+017E>ep}}, {{lang-sr|''<U+041C><U+0435><U+0434><U+0430><U+0447><U+043A><U+0438> <U+045F><U+0435><U+043F>''}}) was a military operation undertaken by the [[Croatian Army]] between 9 September <U+2013> 17 September 1993, in which a [[salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] reaching the south suburbs of [[Gospi<U+0107>]], in the south-central [[Lika]] region of [[Croatia]], then under the control of the self-proclaimed [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], was attacked by Croatian forces.

The Croatian offensive temporarily succeeded in expelling rebel Serb forces from the pocket after several days of fighting. However, the operation ended in controversy after a skirmish with [[United Nations]] [[Peacekeeping| peacekeepers]] and accusations of serious Croatian [[war crimes]] against local Serb civilians.  Although the outcome of the battle was a tactical victory for the Croatians, it became a serious political liability for the Croatian government and international political pressure forced a withdrawal to the previous ceasefire lines.

According to Canadian and French military sources, UN and Croatian troops exchanged heavy fire. In Canada, the battle was considered their most severe of the last half of the 20th Century with the exception of the [[Korean War]],<ref name="honors its heroes">{{cite web |date=2 December 2002 |url = http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20021202/UMEDAM/national/national/nationalTheNationHeadline_temp/13/13/17/|title = Canada honours its heroes of Balkan battle |publisher = The Globe and Mail| accessdate = 2008-06-01 }}</ref> while Croatian sources describe it as merely a brief, accidental exchange of fire resulting in no casualties.

==Background==
Much of the interior of the [[Lika]] region of southern Croatia was captured by Krajina Serb (RSK) forces and the Serb-dominated [[Yugoslav National Army]] during 1991, as Croatia moved towards independence from the  [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (see [[History of modern Croatia]] for more on this period). The region saw heavy fighting throughout the summer and autumn of 1991, during which Croatian Serb rebels established the self-proclaimed (but internationally unrecognised) Republic of Serb Krajina.  Almost all of the Croatian population in the Serb-held area was killed, expelled or forced to seek refuge in government held areas. Serbs continued shelling the major Croatian cities of Gospi<U+0107>, Zadar and Sibenik throughout the year from their positions, killing hundreds of civilians. Serious human rights violations were also perpetrated against Serbs in the Croatian government-held parts of the region, most notably the [[Gospi<U+0107> massacre]] of October 1991. A ceasefire was agreed following the fall of the town of [[Vukovar]] at the end of the [[Battle of Vukovar]] in November 1991 and a United Nations peacekeeping force ([[UNPROFOR]]) was installed to police the armistice lines.

Despite this, sporadic sniping and shelling continued to take place between the two sides. [[Gospi<U+0107>]], which was close to the front lines, was repeatedly subjected to shellfire from the [[Serbian Army of Krajina]] (SVK). The town was of great importance in securing lines of communication between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. Much of the shelling took place from the Serb-controlled Medak Pocket, an area of high ground approximately four to five kilometres wide and five to six kilometres long which consisted of the localities of Divoselo, <U+010C>itluk and part of Po<U+010D>itelj plus numerous small hamlets. The pocket was primarily a rural area with a combination of forest and open fields. It was fairly lightly inhabited before the attack, with about 400 Serb civilians residing in the area<ref name="Ademi-Norac Indictment">International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ''[http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/ade-ci040730e.htm The Prosecutor v. Rahim ADEMI and Mirko NORAC <U+2014> Consolidated Indictment]''</ref> and was held by units of the SVK's 15th Lika Corps.

The pocket adjoined Sector South, one of the four [[United Nations Protection Force|United Nations Protected Areas]] (UNPAs) in Croatia. It was not actually in the UNPA but lay just outside in a so-called "pink zone", or disputed area, patrolled by UNPROFOR peacekeepers. Prior to the Medak Pocket offensive, Croatian government forces had launched several relatively small-scale attacks to retake rebel Serb-held territory in "pink zones" at the Miljevci Plateau in June 1992 and the area of the [[Operation Maslenica|Maslenica bridge]] in northern [[Dalmatia]] in January 1993.<ref name="Ademi-Norac Indictment"/>  It has been alleged that the timing of the [[Operation Maslenica| Maslenica]] and Medak offensives was owed to the political imperatives of Croatian President [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]], who was facing political difficulties following Croatia's intervention in the war in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].<ref>Marcus Tanner, ''Croatia: A Nation Forged in War'', p. 291. Yale University Press, 1997</ref>

==The offensive==
===9<U+2013>14 September===

Croatian forces began their offensive at approximately 06:00 on 9 September 1993. The attack involved around 2,500 troops drawn from the Croatian Army's Gospi<U+0107> Operational Zone, including the 9th Guards Brigade, 111th Brigade, Gospi<U+0107> Home Guard Battalion, Lovinac Home Guard Battalion and Special Police Units of the Croatian [[Ministry of the Interior]] (MUP). The Croatians were largely armed with standard-issue [[Warsaw Pact]] equipment captured from the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], including [[T-72]] [[tank]]s, as well as large numbers of artillery pieces and an array of small arms.

The SVK was taken by surprise and fell back. After two days of fighting the Croatian forces had taken control of Divoselo, <U+010C>itluk and part of Po<U+010D>itelj.  The salient was pinched out with the new front line running just in front of the village of Medak.  In retaliation for the offensive, Serb forces began to use long-range artillery to shell the city of [[Karlovac]] and fired [[FROG-7]] [[ballistic missile]]s into the Croatian capital [[Zagreb]].<ref name="Windsor">Lee A. Windsor, "[http://www.cda-cdai.ca/library/medakpocket.htm The Medak Pocket]"</ref> The attack on Karlovac was especially brutal and dozens of civilians were killed.<ref>[http://www.ffzg.hr/hsd/polemos/drugi/d.html (Croatian) Rat u Hrvatskoj 1991<U+2013>95, Part II]</ref>

The SVK launched counter-attacks which retook some of the captured territory and brought the Croatian advance to a halt. It also threatened to attack 20 or 30 more targets throughout Croatia unless the captured territory was handed back.  The two sides exchanged heavy artillery fire during 12<U+2013>13 September, with the UN recording over 6,000 detonations in the Gospi<U+0107>-Medak area. On 13 and 14 September, [[Croatian Air Force]] [[MiG-21]] aircraft attacked SVK artillery and rocket batteries in [[Banija]] and [[Kordun]] but one aircraft was shot down near [[Vrginmost]].<ref name="Isby">David C. Isby, ''Balkan Battlegrounds: A Military History of the Yugoslav Conflict, 1990<U+2013>1995'', p. 269</ref>

===15<U+2013>17 September===
====Ceasefire====
The offensive attracted strong international criticism and, facing political and military pressure at home and from abroad, the Croatian government agreed to a ceasefire.  The United Nations commander in Croatia, General [[Jean Cot]], arranged and mediated ceasefire discussions.<ref name="Isby"/> On 15 September a ceasefire agreement was signed by General [[Mile Novakovi<U+0107>]], on behalf of the Serbian side and Major-General [[Petar Stipeti<U+0107>]], on behalf of the Croatian side. The agreement required the Croatian forces to withdraw to the starting lines of 9 September, and for Serb forces to withdraw from the pocket and remain withdrawn thereafter.  The Croatian withdrawal was scheduled for 1200 on 15 September.<ref name="Ademi-Norac Indictment"/>

In order to oversee the withdrawal and protect local civilians, UNPROFOR sent 875 troops of the Second Battalion of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] to move into the pocket, accompanied by two [[French Army]] mechanized units. The UN forces, under the command of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[James Calvin]], were instructed to interpose themselves between the Serb and Croatian forces.
====Canadian buffer====
The Canadians were among the best armed troops at UNPROFOR's disposal, making them a natural choice for this dangerous task.  They were equipped with [[M-113]] [[armoured personnel carrier]]s and carried a mix of [[FN MAG|C-6]] medium machine guns, [[C-7 (rifle)|C-7]] assault rifles, [[M249 Squad Automatic Weapon|C-9]] light machine guns, and [[84 mm Carl Gustav anti-tank rocket]]s. The attached Heavy Weapons Support Company brought [[81 mm mortar]]s and a specially fitted APC armed with anti-tank guided missiles.<ref name="Windsor"/>

Up until that time the Croatian forces had little respect for UN forces who, with their restrictive UN mandate, often fled before any type of resistance.  Earlier that year Croatian troops had launched an attack in order to seize a power dam and reservoir.  UN forces stationed in the area quickly fled before the attacking Croats, confirming Croat beliefs that a show of force would scare away the UN soldiers.<ref name="Windsor"/>

The Croatian forces, under the pretext of not receiving authorization from Zagreb, decided to attack the Canadian forces who were moving in between the Serb and Croat forces.  Private Scott LeBlanc who was present in the UN forces recalls, "We started taking fire almost immediately from the Croats".<ref name="MacLeans">{{cite news |date=2 September 2002|url = |title = FIREFIGHT AT THE MEDAK POCKET|format = HTML |publisher = [[MacLeans Magazine]]| accessdate = 2007-10-08 | last=Michael Snider with Sean M Maloney |quote=}}</ref>  When the Canadians began constructing a fortified position, the Croatians fired hundreds of artillery shells at them. The barrage was sporadic, however, and the Canadians successfully used breaks in the shelling to repair and reinforce their positions. In the end, only four Canadians were wounded by the attack.

The UN forces subsequently took control of abandoned Serbian positions but again came under fire from the Croatian lines, with the attackers using [[rocket propelled grenade]]s and [[anti-aircraft gun]]s. The UN troops then dug in their positions and returned fire. As night fell the Croatians attempted several flanking manoeuvres but the Canadians responded with [[sniper]] fire against the Croatian infantry.  The French used 20 mm cannon fire to suppress Croatian heavy weapons. Although this destroyed only a few of the heavy weapons, the aggressive UN response convinced the Croatians to only use their strongest weapons sporadically. They did not deploy their most powerful weapons, such as their tanks, apparently fearing that the UN would use anti-tank missiles and air support against them.<ref name="Windsor"/>  The Croatian commander, Rahim Ademi, upon realizing that his forces had reached a stalemate, met with the Canadian commander and agreed to a ceasefire where his troops would withdraw by noon the next day.

When the deadline passed, Canadian forces attempted to cross the Croatian lines, but were stopped at a mined and well-defended roadblock. Unwilling to fight his way through, Calvin instead held an impromptu media conference with the roadblock as a backdrop, telling 20 or so international journalists that Croatian forces clearly had something to hide.<ref name="MacLeans"/>  The Croatian high command, realizing they had a public relations disaster on their hands, quickly moved back to their lines held on 9 September.  The withdrawal was finally verified as having been completed by 18:00 on 17 September, bringing the offensive to an end.

The advancing Canadian forces discovered that the Croat army had destroyed almost all of the Serb buildings, razing them to the ground.  In the burning wrecks they found 16 mutilated corpses -- some with their eyes cut out.<ref name="MacLeans"/> The Canadians expected to find many survivors hiding in the woods, but no Serb was found alive. Rubber surgical gloves littered the area, suggesting a cleanup operation.<ref name="Windsor"/> Everything was recorded and handed over to the [[ICTY|International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]].  The evidence helped convince the ICTY to issue an indictment in 2001 against Ademi, charging him with crimes against humanity. The indictment included a list of some of the victims, Sara Krickovic, female, 71, throat cut; Pera Krajnovic, female, 86, burned to death; Andja Jovic, female, 74, beaten and shot.<ref name="MacLeans"/>

Calvin, the Canadian commander, later reported that "27 of [the Croatian Army's] members were killed or wounded during the fire fights with my battle group during the 14 days in Medak".<ref name="calvin" />  Even though the operation was considered a success, due to the emerging [[Somalia Affair]], the clash was not highly publicized at the time. However, Calvin and his troops were recognized in 2002 for their bravery when the newly created Commander-in-Chief's Unit Citation was awarded to the 2nd Battalion, PPCLI.  In Canada, the alleged event has been referred to as "Canada's secret battle", while in Croatia this event is denied.

Calvin's report that 27 of the Croatian Army's members were killed or wounded is, according to Calvin, based on "Croatian reports",<ref name=".forces.gc.ca">National Defence and Canadian Forces (DND/CF): [http://www.forces.gc.ca/hr/scondva/engraph/270498_e.asp SCONDVA - Transcripts - Monday, 27 April 1998]: The Croatians reported that 27 of their members were killed or wounded during the fire fights with my battle group during the 14 days in Medak. </ref> and not on his own data. 

The French Lieutenant-General Jean Cot, who was in charge of the operation and Calvin's superior officer, backs up the Canadian account of what happened and says:
{{Cquote2|It was the most important force operation the UN conducted in the former Yugoslavia ... While we could not prevent the slaughter of the Serbs by the Croatians, including elderly people and children, we drove back to its start line a well-equipped Croatian battalion of some thousand men.

====Croatian denial====

In 2002 the Croatian newspaper ''Nacional'' published a report claiming that "the armed conflict between the Croatian and Canadian forces in operation Medak Pocket from 9 to 17 September 1993 never happened" and that the Canadians had fired "no more than a couple of shots into the night."<ref>''Nacional'', 4 December 2002</ref>  Retired Croatian general Davor Domazet-Loso, in an effort to defend his fellow Croatian generals fighting [[ICTY]] crimes against humanity charges, suggested Canadian troops fought Serb not Croat fighters.<ref name="canada_2002">{{cite web |date= 20 September 2002|url = http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=24f6fcb4-43e5-4190-9bcb-ac790d02bb83|title = No battle, no war crimes, general claims|format = HTML |publisher = [[Edmonton Journal]]| accessdate = 2007-10-08 | last= David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen; CanWest News Service|quote=}}</ref>  This was strongly denied by the Canadian [[Department of National Defence]], the Canadian Commander at the time, retired Col.

Radio 101 reported the testimony of a UN officer, Danish colonel Vagn Ove Moebjerg Nielsen, a witness at the Norac/Ademi trial for war crimes in Medak Pocket. Colonel Nielsen, who was not present during the Medak Pocket offensive, reportedly stated that in September 1993, except for one minor incident, there was no armed conflict between Croatian soldiers and the "blue helmets".<ref name="radio101.hr Vagn Ove Moebjerg Nielsen">Radio 101: [http://www.radio101.hr/index.php?section=1&page=1&item=30764 Svjedok: U Meda<U+010D>kom d<U+017E>epu nije bilo sukoba Hrvata i UNPROFOR-a] ([http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:l-F-IyQSRoEJ:www.radio101.hr/index.php%3Fsection%3D1%26page%3D1%26item%3D30764+site:radio101.hr+Vagn+Ove+Moebjerg+Nielsen&hl=hr&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=hr&client=firefox-a google cache])): Nije bilo oru<U+017E>anih sukoba izme<U+0111>u Hrvatske vojske i UNPROFOR-a, iako je hrvatska strana odugovla<U+010D>ila s napu<U+0161>tanjem polo<U+017E>aja, izjavio je biv<U+0161>i <U+010D>asnik UNPROFOR-a Vagn Ove Moebjerg Nielsen u nastavku su<U+0111>enja generalima Rahimu Ademiju i Mirku Norcu za ratne zlo<U+010D>ine u Meda<U+010D>kom d<U+017E>epu '93.

'''Translation to english:'''

Witness: There was no battle between Croats and UNPROFOR in Medak pocket:

"There was no armed conflict between HV and UNPROFOR, although, the Croatian side stalled retreat," was being said by ex officer of UNPROFOR Vagn Ove Moebjerg Nielsen during the Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac trial, for war crimes in Medak pocket 1993.

"Despite Canadian claims that their forces fought against Croats in the biggest battle since the Korean war, and despite that they decorated a whole infantry battalion, there was only one minor incident," said colonel Nielsen, ex military observer. He had taken command of the peace-keeping corps in ex Krajina in July 1993, and he claims that there was not any fighting.

"When Canadians were positioned in front of Serbian forces, I think it was on the 15th of September, there was shooting on Canadian by Croat forces before we entered Medak pocket, but during the operation, there was no problem, all went smooth. I think that Croats stopped shooting, when they realised that they were shooting at UN."

Nielsen also said that Canadians were not shooting back, and he remembered that the Croat side stalled their retreat, and that during the first attempt at entrance they did not allow passage, because as they claimed, it was too dangerous.</ref>

"There was no armed conflict. Only one incident happened when Canadian forces took positions in front of Serb positions. The Croatian Army took a few shots towards Canadians, but they did not retaliate. I think the Croatians stopped shooting once they realised they were shooting towards UN soldiers", said Colonel Nielsen.<ref name="radio101.hr Vagn Ove Moebjerg Nielsen"/>  
The Canadian Government claimed that their forces within the UN contingent clashed with the Croatian Army. They are naming the battle at the Medac Pocket "the greatest battle of the Canadian Army since the Korean War", and the whole infantry battalion was decorated for their service. Canadian sources state that 26 Croatian soldiers were killed in that battle.  The Croatian military and civilian sources reject that any were killed and claim that no one has reported any missing Croatian soldiers.  The official Croatian figure for casualties in the period 9<U+2014>17 September is 10.<ref name="nacional.hr 11.12.2002"/>

==War crimes investigations==

The UN immediately began an investigation into the events at Medak. The task was hampered by the systematic destruction that had been carried out by the withdrawing Croatians. The UN forces found that (in the words of an official Canadian study on the incident) "each and every building in the Medak Pocket had been leveled to the ground", in a total of eleven villages and hamlets.<ref name="Windsor"/>

Investigators from the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) determined that at least 100 Serb civilians had been unlawfully killed and many others had suffered serious injuries; many of the victims were women and elderly people. 29 executed Serb civilians have been identified, as well as five Serb soldiers who had been captured or wounded. More were thought to have been killed, but the bodies were said to have been removed or destroyed by the Croatians.<ref name="Windsor"/> In addition, Serb-owned property was systematically looted and destroyed to render the area uninhabitable. Personal belongings, household goods, furniture, housing items, farm animals, farm machinery and other equipment were looted or destroyed, and wells were polluted to make them unusable. An estimated 164 homes and 148 barns and outbuildings were burned down or blown up. Much of the destruction was said to have taken place during the 48 hours between the ceasefire being signed and the withdrawal being completed.<ref name="Ademi-Norac Indictment"/><ref>"[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/VII.htm Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts, Annex VII, Medak investigation]", 28 December 1994</ref>

The US Department of State claimed that Croatian forces destroyed 11 Serbian villages and killed at least 67 individuals, including civilians.<ref name = "HRI">[http://www.hri.org/docs/USSD-Rights/93/Croatia93.html CROATIA HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES, 1993, US Department of State]</ref>

Several members of the Croatian military were subsequently charged with war crimes. The highest-ranking indictee was General [[Janko Bobetko]]. He was indicted for war crimes by the ICTY in 2001,<ref name="UN Janko">{{cite web | title=The prosecutor of the tribunal against Janko Bobetko | publisher=UN.org | work=un.org | url=http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/bob-ii020826-e.htm | accessdate=14 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref> but died before the case was heard by the court, and in consequence the trial was cancelled.

The wider area was under the jurisdiction of the Gospi<U+0107> Military District, commanded at the time by Brigadier [[Rahim Ademi]]. He was also indicted by the ICTY and was transferred there in 2001. In 2004, General [[Mirko Norac]] &ndash; who was already serving a 12-year jail sentence in Croatia for his role in the [[Gospi<U+0107> massacre]] &ndash; was also indicted and transferred to [[The Hague]]. The two cases were joined in July 2004 and in November 2005 the Tribunal agreed to a Croatian government request to transfer the case back to Croatia, for trial before a Croatian court.<ref name="CT/MO/1015e">{{cite web |date=The Hague, 1 November 2005|url = http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2005/p1015-e.htm|title =CT/MO/1015e - RAHIM ADEMI AND MIRKO NORAC CASE TRANSFERRED TO CROATIA|format = HTML |publisher = pub| accessdate = 2008-08-12 | last= |quote=Today, 1 November 2005, the Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac case was officially transferred to the Republic of Croatia by the ICTY.

==Aftermath==

After the offensive, most of the villages in the area were destroyed and depopulated. Even today, the region is still largely abandoned, though some Serbs have since returned to it.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2354129.stm Memories live on for Croatia's victims", BBC News, 23 October 2002]</ref>  The region remained, in effect, neutral ground between the warring sides until near the end of the war. It was recaptured by the  Croatian Army on 4 August 1995 during [[Operation Storm]], which ended in the defeat of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina. 
 
The Medak Pocket offensive can be considered a tactical victory for the Croats in that it reduced the Serb threat against Gospi<U+0107> and permanently eliminated the possibility of splitting Croatia in half as had been planned. The goal having been achieved, the Croatian Army did not, at the time, press any further since the geopolitical and strategic situation was not ideal for a major offensive to fully control the region. The offensive also exposed serious weaknesses in the Croatian Army's [[command, control, and communications]], which had also been a problem in [[Operation Maslenica]] earlier in the year.

The operation caused serious political difficulties for the Croatian government, which was heavily criticised abroad for its actions at Medak. The well-publicised accusations of war crimes, along with the Muslim-Croat bloodshed in Bosnia, led to Croatia's image being severely tarnished; in many quarters abroad, the country was viewed as having moved from being a victim to an aggressor.<ref>Ivo Bicanic, "Croatia", in ''Balkan Reconstruction'', p. 168. Routledge, 2001</ref><ref>Adam LeBor, ''Milosevic: A Biography'', p. 224. Yale University Press, 2004</ref> It also provided a major propaganda boost for the Serbian side.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

The war crimes committed during the operation damaged the credibility of UNPROFOR as well, as its forces had been unable to prevent them despite being in the vicinity at the time. [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], the [[UN Secretary-General]], admitted that

: "The 9 September 1993 Croatian destruction of three villages in the Medak pocket has, despite the robust action taken by UNPROFOR to secure the withdrawal of Croatian forces, further increased the mistrust of the Serbs towards UNPROFOR and has led to the reaffirmation of their refusal to disarm.  In turn, this refusal to disarm, as required in the United Nations peace-keeping plan, has prevented UNPROFOR from implementing other essential elements of the plan, particularly facilitating the return of refugees and displaced persons to their places of origins in secure conditions."<ref>UN Secretary-General, Report S/1994/300, 16 March 1994</ref>
