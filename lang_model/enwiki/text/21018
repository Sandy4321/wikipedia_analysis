==History==
First Command was founded in 1958 by Carroll Payne, a retired military officer who realized that military families needed assistance in planning for their financial futures. Payne wanted to create a company that recognized and dealt with the unique circustances surrounding United States military personnel.

USPA&IRA, the previous name of First Command, received its broker/dealer registration from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 2, 1959.  On January 21, 1959, the National Association of Securities Dealers ([[NASD]]) approved the company<U+2019>s application for membership.  On April 21, 1997, "First Command Bank" opened its doors to expand the services of the company.  Four years later, in 2001, the company changed its name to First Command Financial Service.  The company explained that they changed their name because:
<blockquote>We are sometimes confused with other companies that service the military and former military clientele and whose names also start with letters <U+201C>US<U+2026><U+201D>. There are several such companies, but none like us and we don<U+2019>t want any confusion.<ref>Spring 2001 issue of ''Independence'' (the company's monthly magazine now known as ''First Command'')</ref></blockquote>

In 2004, the Board of Advisors included General [[Anthony Zinni]], the retired Commander in Chief of the [[United States Central Command]]; [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Commandant [[Robert E. Kramek]], General [[Lloyd W. Newton|Lloyd "Fig" Newton]], and Vice Admiral [[John R. Ryan]], former superintendent of the [[United States Naval Academy|Naval Academy]].<ref name = "Henry" />

As of [[December 31]] [[2006]], First Command had over 294,000 client families, [[United States dollar|$]]17.4 billion in managed assets, $52.2 billion in [[insurance]] products, and $567 million in [[bank]]ing assets. First Command states that out of all members of the U.S. military, their clients include 40% of the general officers, 33% of commissioned officers, and 16% of non-commissioned officers.<ref name = "SEC2" />  Most of First Command's agents are former senior enlisted personnel or retired officers.

===Regulatory settlement===
On 15 December 2004, the U.S. [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) found First Command guilty of violating Section 17(a)(2) of the [[Securities Act of 1933]], a section which deals with [[fraud]]ulent activities and the mail.  It was determined by the SEC that First Command "willfully" violated the law by making "misleading statements and omissions" concerning marketing, comparisons with other funds, the availability and effectiveness to military personnel of TSPs<ref>the military's equivalent to a 401(b)</ref>, and the ability of a large front-end load in keeping people committed to the systematic plan.<ref name = "SEC10">SEC p 10.  The Company targeted senior enlisted personnel (E-6s and above) and officers as their target clientele. Smith, p. 3.</ref>

The SEC was highly critical of the manner in which First Command's sales script compared their Systematic Plans with other mutual funds, in particular, the representation of no-load mutual funds. According to the script, no-load funds "attract only speculators" while the Systematic Plans were the "only five mutual funds that are designed to attract only dollar cost average investors."<ref name = "SEC8">SEC p. 8.</ref> The advantage of the Systematic Plans, the company claimed, was that they maintained stable cash flow. No-load funds are portrayed as being highly volatile due to fund managers having to sell shares when speculators unexpectedly redeem their shares.  This, the script posited, caused no-load funds to "frequently have some of the highest long-term costs." The SEC, however, noted that no-load funds are lower than load funds or Systematic Plans.<ref name = "SEC8" />  The SEC found that when comparing TSPs with Systematic Plans, the literature "fail[ed] to account for the impact of the 50% upfront sales load on the long-term cost of systematic plans, both in terms of the actual costs and the lost opportunity costs in terms of overall return."<ref>SEC p. 8, 14-15.</ref>

First Command "mischaracterizes the upfront sales load as the only way a [[Investment management|fund manager]] can ensure that most of the [[shareholder]]s are committed, long-term investors."<ref name = "SEC9">SEC p. 9.</ref> The SEC then goes on to indicate that the company knew that the sales charge has not "worked." In fact only 43% of those people who purchased Systematic Plans between 1980-1987 completed their contract.<ref name = "SEC9" />

In December 2004, First Command settled with the SEC and NASD without admitting guilt. As part of the [[Settlement (law)|settlement]] First Command agreed to [[restitution]] to all clients who purchased and sold a systematic plan between 1999 and 2004; establishment of an educational programs; monitoring or prefiling.<ref name = "SEC 12">SEC p. 12.</ref>

===Operations since settlement===
After the settlement, First Command hired Adan Araujo, the Senior Counsel for the SEC, as its new Chief Compliance Officer.  Adan stated, "My long-term goals include ensuring that First Command's<U+2122> legal compliance procedures are second to none, and to help provide the ultimate financial protection to our clients and employees."<ref>Araujo, Adan. Questions and Answers.  First Command Magazine Summer 2005.</ref>  To that end, they recruited Bachrach and Associates Inc.  According to ''Financial Planning Magazine'', Bill Bachrach is one of the four most influential people in the financial services industry.<ref>[http://www.speakersroundtable.com/bachrach/index.html Speakers Roundtable] Access June 18, 07</ref>  Bachrach said,  
<blockquote>Sales techniques are what have to be used with people who don't trust someone.  We'll teach planners how to quickly and predictably earn people's trust so they don't have to sell.  When a financial advisor is trusted, people will give them all of their money and follow their advice without having to be sold.  Don't be a salesperson. Be a trusted advisor.<ref>Business Editors. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Financial+Profiles%2c+Inc.+Hosts+Bill+Bachrach+Seminars-a079828603 Financial Profiles, Inc. Hosts Bill Bachrach Seminars] Nov 7, 2001.  Accessed (sicsic) June 18, 07.</ref></blockquote>  As a result of its relationship with Bill Bachrach, the marketing techniques of First Command have changed significantly.  The company no longer endorses the use of the introductory seminar/dinner.

In the spring of 2005, First Command filed with the SEC to become a [[Registered Investment Adviser]] (RIA).  This requires their agents to obtain additional training and certifications.  As RIAs, the agents are now "Financial Advisors" as compared to "Registered Agents",<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/0415biz-Wiles0415.html Financial job titles clarified by ruling, licenses] The Arizona Republic.

The company no longer offers the controversial systematic investment plans.<ref name = "DOS">First Command.[http://www.firstcommand.com/pdf/DOS.pdf Description of Services: First Command Financial Planning Inc.] Accessed 6/19/07</ref>

As of August 2006, Mary Shapiro, the NASD Vice-Chairman and President of Regulatory Policy and Oversight, continued to be critical of First Command, calling it an "unscrupulous organization" with an "awful" product.  First Command's new president, Marty Durbin, responded to her criticism by stating, "It<U+2019>s unfortunate that settling these charges still doesn<U+2019>t mean it<U+2019>s behind us. But it<U+2019>s a futile effort to try to fight negative press and so we decided not to put a lot of energy that way."<ref>Lee, Shelley. "Marty Durbin on First Command<U+2019>s <U+2018>Perfect Storm,<U+2019> Moving Beyond, and Serving Middle America" Journal of Financial Planning. November 2006. Accessed June 18, 2006.</ref>  Since Shapiro's comments in August 2006, First Command has continued to strive to change its image.

In September 2007, a California judge granted "Class Action" status to a 2005 law suit filed by systematic plan holders whose plans were active when the SEC issued its ruling on December 15, 2004.<ref>Karen Jowers.
