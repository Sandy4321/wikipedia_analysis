The site includes two large pools, several ponds, [[rhyne]]s, grazing marsh, hay meadows and hedgerows. It provides a habitat for a wide range of plants and animals. [[Great crested newt]]s (''Triturus cristatus''), [[Water vole]]s (''Arvicola''), [[Grass snake]]s (''Natrix natrix'') and [[European Hare|Brown Hare]]s (''Lepus europaeus'') have been seen and there is evidence that [[European Otter|Otter]]s (''Lutra lutra'') are moving in. A wide variety of birds are making there homes on the site, including [[Barn Owl]]s (''Tyto alba''), and it is visited by large number of migratory birds use the [[Severn Estuary]] on their journeys. These include: [[Curlew]] (''Numenius''), [[Dunlin]] (''Calidris alpina''), [[Redshank]] (''Tringa totanus'') and [[Shelduck]] (''Tadorna'').<ref name="awtmagazine">{{cite journal|date=Summer 2010|title=Portbury Ashlands|journal=Wildlife|publisher=Avon Wildlife Trust|issue=88|pages=6-7|url=http://www.avonwildlifetrust.org.uk/documents/Wildlife-mag.pdf}}</ref> The tidal range results in the estuary having one of the most extensive intertidal wildlife habitats in the UK, comprising mudflats, sandflats, rocky platforms and islands. These form a basis for plant and animal communities typical of extreme physical conditions of liquid mud and tide-swept sand and rock.  The estuary is recognised as a wetland area of international importance and is designated as a [[Ramsar site]].<ref>[http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/RIS/UK11081.pdf Information on Severn Estuary Ramsar site designation]</ref> Parts of the estuary have also been designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].  The SSSI includes most of the foreshore upstream from Cardiff and [[Brean Down]] and most of the upper estuary as far as [[Sharpness]]<ref>[http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1002284.pdf Severn Estuary SSSI citation]</ref>. The Ashalnds also provides a green link between the estuary and the [[Gordano Valley]] which has been designated as a [[National Nature Reserve]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/nnr/1006061.aspx|title=Gordano Valley NNR|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref>
