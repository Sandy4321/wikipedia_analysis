'''William Somerville Edmiston''' (November 10, 1857 &ndash; July 24, 1903) was an architect and politician in present day [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. He was a member of the [[Edmonton Town Council]] and for two terms, the mayor of [[Edmonton]].

Originally a native of [[Scotland]], Edmiston came to Canada to settle in [[Clover Bar, Alberta|Clover Bar]], [[Northwest Territories]] in the early 1880s. After living there for about ten years, he relocated to [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] where he would employ himself as an architect, the first ever in the town. Engaging in a partnership with another fellow architect, his firm would design some of the first buildings in the newly developing town. He would also involve himself with the town's politics, sitting on the [[Edmonton Town Council]], and later serving out two terms as Mayor of Edmonton, from 1897 to 1899. During his time as mayor, he involved himself in local affairs as well as run his architectural business. He would also lobby for a new bridge to be built over the [[North Saskatchewan River]], connecting Edmonton with the town of Strathcona. He would voluntarily relinquish his position as mayor and not run in the 1899 election, opting to retire.

Edmiston was also very active in the sporting affairs of Edmonton, participating in and managing many sporting activities and clubs. He died after an accident which resulted in [[heart failure]] in 1903; an industrial park in Edmonton was subsequently named after him.
