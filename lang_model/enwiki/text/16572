'''Marshall''' is a major city of the [[Northeast Texas|northeastern]] region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. It is a major cultural and educational center in [[East Texas]], and the multi-state [[Ark-La-Tex]] region. As of the 2000 [[U.S. Census]], Marshall population was 23,935. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]]{{GR|6}}.

The city was a political and production center of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]], and was a major [[railroad]] center of the [[Texas and Pacific Railroad|T&P Railroad]] from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century. The city's large [[African-American]] population and the presence of black institutions of higher learning made Marshall a center of the [[American Civil Rights Movement|civil rights movement]] in [[Southern United States|the South]]. The city is known for holding one of the largest light festivals in the United States, the ''[[Holiday Trail of Lights|Wonderland of Lights]]'',<ref name=TSTG>[http://traveltex.com/pg.asp?PN=5380&SN=10872884&LS=0&BoxType=1&BoxDistance=0&BoxMonth=4/ Texas State Travel Guide/Wonder land of Lights]</ref> and, as the [[List of city nicknames in the United States|self-proclaimed]] ''Pottery Capital of the World'', for its sizable [[pottery]] industry.

Marshall is also referred to by various nicknames; the ''Cultural Capital of East Texas'',<ref name=MCC>[http://www.marshall-chamber.com/pages/marshall.php|Marshall Chamber of Commerce]</ref> the ''Gateway of Texas'', the ''[[Athens of Texas]]'',<ref name="Lale 7">{{cite book| last=Lale| first=Max S.| year=1991| title=Coming Home Souvenir Program 150th Birthday Celebration| edition=1 | publisher=Unknown Local Printer(s)| id=ISBN 1-879703-01-7| pages=7}}</ref> and the ''City of Seven Flags''.

==History==
{{main|History of Marshall, Texas}}
===19th Century===
====The Republic of Texas and the Civil War====
The city was founded in 1841 as the seat of Harrison County, after repeated failed attempts to establish a county seat on the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]] since the county was established in 1839, and was incorporated in 1843.<ref name="Lale 7"/> The [[Republic of Texas]] decided to choose the site of land granted by [[Peter Whetstone]] and [[Isaac Van Zandt]] after Whetstone had proven that the hilly location had a good water source. The city quickly became a major city in the state because of its position as a gateway to Texas on several major [[stage coach]] lines. The establishment several "colleges"&mdash; schools offering little more than secondary education&mdash;earned Marshall the nickname ''the Athens of Texas'', in reference to the ancient Greek city state. The city's growing importance was confirmed when Marshall was linked by a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] line to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], becoming the first city in Texas to have a telegraph service.<ref name="Campbell">{{cite web| last=Campbell| first=Randolph B.| title=Marshall, Texas| work=The Handbook of Texas Online| url=http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/MM/hem1.html| accessdate=2006-05-25| year=July 13, 2001}}</ref>

[[Image:Wyalucing.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Wyalucing [[plantation]] was the childhood home of the only woman to appear on [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate currency]], [[Lucy Holcombe Pickens]], and housed the office of the Trans-Mississippi Postal Department.]]

By 1860 the city was the fourth largest city in [[Texas]] and the seat of the richest county. The county had more [[slavery|slave]]s than any other in the state, making it a hotbed of anti-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sentiment. When Gov. [[Sam Houston]] refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Marshall's [[Edward Clark]] was sworn in as governor. Marshall would also produce Texas's third [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] governor, [[Pendleton Murrah]]. Marshall became a major Confederate city; producing [[gunpowder]] and other supplies for the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]],<ref name="Lale 12">Lale p. 12</ref> and hosting three conferences of [[Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War|Trans-Mississippi]] and [[Indian Territory]] leaders. The city also became the capital of [[Missouri]]'s Confederate government-in-exile,<ref name="Campbell"/> earning the it nickname the ''City of Seven Flags''&mdash;a nod to the [[flag of Missouri]] in addition to the other [[Six flags of Texas|six flags]] that have flown over the city.

Marshall became the seat of civil authority and headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi Postal Department after the fall of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The city may have been the intended target of a failed Union advance that was rebuffed at [[Mansfield, Louisiana]]. Towards the end of the Civil War [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] had $9 million in Treasury notes and $3 million in [[postage stamp]]s shipped to Marshall,<ref name="Davis 413">{{cite book| last=Davis| first=Willaim C.| year=2002| title=Look Away!: A History of the Confederate States of America| edition=1 | publisher=Free Press| id=ISBN 0-684-86585-8| pages=413}}</ref> possibly meaning that Marshall was the intended destination of a government preparing to flee from advancing armies.

====Reconstruction and the Railroad Era====
[[Image:A former slave displaying a horn used to call slaves.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Many African-Americans came to Marshall during [[Reconstruction]]; but the establishment of the White Citizens Party after the Union troops departed kept many former [[slavery|slaves]] locked into poverty. A former slave displays a horn formerly used to call slaves on the outskirts of Marshall in 1939.]]

Marshall was occupied by Union forces on [[June 17]], [[1865]].<ref name="Campbell 268">{{cite book| last=Campbell| first=Randolph B.| year=2003| title=Gone to Texas: A History of the Lone Star State| edition=1 | publisher=Oxford University Press| id=ISBN 0-19-513843-0| pages=268}}</ref> During Reconstruction the city was home to an office of the [[Freedmen's Bureau]]<ref name="Campbell 272">Campbell p. 272</ref> and was the base for Union troops. In 1873 The [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] founded [[Wiley College]] to educate free men. African-Americans came to the city seeking opportunities and protection until 1878, when the ''Citizens Party'', led by former Confederate General [[Walter P. Lane]] and his brother George, took control of the city and county governments and ran Unionists, [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]] and many [[African-American]]s out of town. The Lanes ultimately declared Marshall and Harrison County "redeemed" from Union and African-American control.<ref name="Berglund">{{cite book| last=Berglund| first=Ernest| year=1948| title=History of Marshall| edition=1}}</ref> Despite this the African-American community would continue to progress with the establishment of Bishop College in 1881 and the certification of Wiley by the [[Freedman's Aid Society]] in 1882.

Marshall's "[[Railroad]] Era" began in the early 1870s. Harrison County citizens voted to offer $300,000 bond subsidy,<ref name="Lale 12">Lale p. 12</ref> and the City of Marshall offered to donate land north of the downtown to the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]] if the company would move to Marshall. T&P President [[Jay Gould]] accepted and located the T&P's workshops and general offices for [[Texas]] in Marshall. The city benefited immediately from a population explosion.<ref name="Campbell"/> By 1880 the city was one of the [[U.S. Southern States|South]]'s largest [[cotton]] markets. The city's new prosperity became apparent with the opening of J. Weisman and Co., the first [[department store]] in Texas, and with the instilation of a single lightbulb in the Texas and Pacific Depot Marshall the first city in Texas to have electricity. Prosperity brought out elements which led to some nationally known crimes being tried in the city including the trials for the murder of [[Diamond Bessie]] and attempted murder of [[Maurice Barrymore]]. During this period of wealth many of the city's now historic homes were constructed. The city's most prominent industry, pottery manufacturing, began with the establishment of [[Marshall Pottery]] in 1895.

Despite the prosperity of the railroad era, poverty continued to be a problem in the city among all races, but tensions between [[whites]] and African-Americans continued to worsen as segregation crystallized in the city. The rural areas of [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]] saw greater interaction between white people and [[African-Americans]]. There, whites and blacks being neighbors was commonplace. Even though the areas surrounding Marshall were somewhat integrated, [[racism]] certainly was still apparent in everyday life. The fact that several [[plantation]] owners divided up sizable tracts of land and gave them to their former slaves may also have contributed to these tensions.

===Twentieth century===
==== Early and mid- 20th century ====
[[Image:Whetstone Square 1939.jpg|thumb|left|280px|The community has developed in and around Whetstone Square, shown here in 1939. Guests lodged in the Capitol Hotel, right, and the taller Hotel Marshall directly behind it. In the 1960s the Harrison County Courthouse, center, hosted the first [[sit-in]]s in Texas.]]

[[Natural gas]] arrived in the city from a field on [[Caddo Lake]] in 1909.<ref name="Lale 21">Lale p. 21</ref> Under the leadership of [[John L. Lancaster]], the Texas and Pacific Railway experienced its height during the first half of the 20th century, Marshall's ceramics industry expanded to the point that the city began to be called the "Pottery Capital of the World." Marshall's industry received a boost with the discovery of what was then the largest oil field in the world at nearby [[Kilgore, Texas|Kilgore]] in 1930. Small landmarks of progress, such as the first student at Marshall High School to have a car, [[Lady Bird Johnson]], excited the working class and poor. These small notes of progress would pail in comparison to the coming civil rights movement.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries children of both races had been raised to accept the [[status quo]] of [[racial segregation]]. African-American Marshall resident [[George Dawson (author)|George Dawson]] later wrote about his childhood experiences with segregation in his book ''Life Is So Good''. He described how, despite African-American children's acceptance of segregation, in some instances its demands were too outrageous to follow. For example, Dawson described how he had refused the demand of one employer who expected him to eat with her dogs.

In the early and mid 20th century Marshall's [[Historically Black Colleges and Universities|traditionally black colleges]] were thriving intellectual and cultural centers. Three major civil rights leaders, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and later [[Jesse Jackson]] attended [[Bishop College]] while [[James L. Farmer, Jr.]] went to [[Wiley College]], and Texas's member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Melvin B. Tolson]], wrote while teaching at Wiley.<ref name="Campbell 365">Campbell p. 365</ref>

With the increasing success of Wiley and Bishop, Marshall developed as one of the hearths of the civil rights movement, spurring key court challenges to [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] on a national and state level. In 1949, Marshall banned the movie ''[[Pinky (1949 movie)|Pinky]]'' from the city because it portrayed an [[interracial couple]], a violation of the city's censorship code. The city was sued and the case went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], which overturned the city's censorship law.

Inspired by the teachings of professors, such as Melvin B. Tolson, students and former student of the colleges mobilized to challenge and dismantle Jim Crow. Fred Lewis, as the secretary of the [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]] [[NAACP]], challenged the oldest [[White Citizens Party]] in Texas and the laws it enforced; ultimately abolishing Jim Crow in the county with the ''[[Perry v. Cyphers]]'' verdict. [[Heman Sweatt]], a Wiley graduate, tried to enroll in the [[University of Texas at Austin]] [[Law school]], but was denied entry because of the color of his skin; he then sued and the [[Texas Supreme Court]] ordered the desegregation of postgraduate studies in Texas in the ''[[Sweatt v. Painter]]'' decision. While James L. Farmer, Jr., also a Wiley graduate, became an organizer of the [[Freedom Rides]] and a founder of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]].

==== Late 20th century ====
The progression of [[civil rights]] would continue into the 1960s, 70s and 80s. In the 1960s, students organized the first [[sit-in]]s in Texas<ref name="Campbell 428">Campbell p. 428</ref> in the [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the county courthouse on Whetstone Square in a move to end segregation of public schools; in 1970, all Marshall [[public school]]s were integrated. Also in that year, Carolyn Abney became the first woman to be elected to the city commission. In April 1975 local businessman Sam Birmingham became the first African-American to be elected to the city commission and, in the 80s, Marshall's first African-American mayor. Birmingham retired in 1989 for health concerns, and was succeeded by his wife, Jean Birmingham, who became the first African-American woman to serve on the commission.

Marshall's railroad industry subsequently declined with the dieselization of most trains, the proliferation of air travel, and the construction of the [[Interstate highway]] system after [[World War II]]. The T&P Shops closed in the 1960s and T&P passenger service ceased in 1970. The Texas oil bust of the 1980s devastated the local economy and the city's population declined by about a thousand between 1980 and 1990.

During the mid-20th century the city lost many of its landmarks. Some building were demolished because their owner disregarded their historic importance and preferred <U+201C>modern<U+201D> structures, others were [[Demolition|demolished]] because their owners felt they could no longer afford to maintain them. By 1990; Marshall's opera house, the Missouri Capitol, the Moses Montefiore Synagogue, the original Viaduct, the Capitol Hotel, and the campus of Bishop College (including the Wyalucing plantation house) had been demolished. In the 1970s the city began to look at the [[Historic preservation|preservation]] efforts of nearby [[Jefferson, Texas|Jefferson]]; increasingly developing a preservationist trend throughout the remainder of the 20th Century.

[[Image:MarshallCourthouse.jpeg|thumb|right|215px|The [[Old Harrison County Courthouse (Texas)|Old Harrison County Courthouse]] in Whetstone Square is the centerpiece of the "Wonderland of Lights," one of the largest light festivals in the United States, and is lit with thousands of lights during the celebration.]]

Due to newly completed construction projects, the city was one of ten designated an [[All-America City Award|All American City]] in 1976 by the [[National Civic League]]. In 1978, then [[Taipei]] mayor, [[Lee Teng-Hui]], and Marshall mayor, William O. Burns, signed legislation recognizing Marshall as a [[sister city]] with the much larger Taipei. During this period [[Bill Moyers]] won an [[Emmy award|Emmy]] for his documentary ''[[Marshall, Texas: Marshall, Texas]]'' chronicling the history of race relations in the city. Despite these instance of national and international attention the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s where largely a period of social and economic decline, as the city was surpassed in population and economic clout by its younger rival [[Longview, Texas|Longview]].

The city began to concentrate on diversifying its economy in the 1980s and 1990s, with tourism emerging as an increasingly important area of the city<U+2019>s economy. Two new festivals joined the longstanding Stagecoach Days, the [[Solenopsis wagneri|Fire Ant]] Festival and the [[Holiday Trail of Lights|Wonderland of Lights]]. The Fire Ant Festival gained national attention through television features on shows such as ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', but it was the Wonderland of Lights that by far became the most popular&mdash;growing to become one of the largest light festivals in the United States. By 2000, the Wonderland of Lights had become such a part of the cityscape that the lighted dome of the Old Courthouse had become the most recognizable symbol of the city.

===Twenty-first century===

[[Image:Sam B. Hall U.S. Couthouse.jpg|thumb|300px|In the first decade of the 21st century the Sam B. Hall, Jr. U.S. Court House became one of the busiest federal courts.]]

The first decade of the 21st century saw moderate economic growth
and a renaissance of downtown. By 2005 the Joe Weisman & Co. building, the T&P Depot, the Hotel Marshall, and the Old Courthouse were either restored or under restoration. Restaurants, boutiques, and loft apartments infused the downtown economy and saved historic structures in decline. Many historic homes outside of downtown continued to deteriorate and some structured in moderate condition were approved for demolition for replacement by pre-fabricated or tin structures.

The Sam B. Hall Federal Courthouse became one of the busiest courthouses in the country, becoming the venue for such cases as the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] challenge to the [[2003 Texas redistricting|2003 redistricting]] of Texas and the [[TiVo]] suit of [[Dish Network|EchoStar]] over [[DVR]] patent rights. 

An unusual number of [[patent]] [[lawsuits]] are being filed in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas]] which includes Marshall, [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], and [[Texarkana, Texas|Texarkana]]. Marshall has a reputation for [[plaintiff]]-friendly [[jury|juries]] for the 5% of patent lawsuits that reach [[Jury trial|trial]], resulting in 78% plaintiff wins. The number of patent suits filed in 2002 was 32, and the number for 2006 has been estimated at 234. Only the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] in Los Angeles will have more patent suits filed than Marshall.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite web| last=Creswell| first=Julie| title=So Small a Town, So Many Patent Suits| work=New York Times| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/24/business/24ward.html?ex=1159329600&en=2beff530451a51dc&ei=5070| year=September 25, 2006}}</ref>

The city entered into a legal battle with local residents and environmentalist about the amount of water it could draw out of Caddo Lake&mdash;the source of the city<U+2019>s water&mdash;dominated city-county relation during the decade.

== Law and government ==
{{main|Politics of Marshall, Texas}}
The City of Marshall has a [[Council-manager government|Council-manager]] form of municipal government, with all governmental powers resting in a [[legislative body]] called a Commission. The Commission passes all city [[law]]s and ordinances, adopts [[budget]]s, determines city policy, and appoints city officials, including the [[City Manager]]. The city manager, rather than a [[mayor]], serves as the executive of the city government and thus is in charge of enforcing city laws and administering the city's various departments.

===The City Commission===
The City Commission has seven members, each elected to serve a single-member district. Districts 1&ndash;4 divide the city into four districts, and the districts 5&ndash;7 divide the city into three districts that overlay Districts 1&ndash;4, so every location in the city falls in two districts, one from each set. Each Commissioner is [[election|elected]] to a two-year term. Districts 1&ndash;4 hold elections in odd-numbered years and districts 5&ndash;7 in even years; elections are held in the [[Spring (season)|spring]]. After each election, the City Commission selects a commissioner to serve as Chairman of the Commission, generically called a Mayor, until after the next year's election. If no one files to run against a commissioner, as happened with District 1 in 2005, the commissioner is reinstated and an election for that district is not held that year. The City Commission meets twice a month on the second and fourth Thursdays, in addition to any special sessions that are called or regular meetings that are canceled. The Commission provides a public forum before each regular session, providing citizens the opportunity to address the commission for two minutes without forward notice, with notice additional time may be scheduled. The Commission meetings are broadcast on [[radio]] and on the local [[public access television]] station.

Marshall is closer to the capitals of Arkansas ([[Little Rock]] 190 miles or 305 km), Louisiana ([[Baton Rouge]], 239 miles or 384 km), and [[Mississippi]] ([[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] 243 miles or 390 km) than it is to the capital of Texas ([[Austin, Texas|Austin]], 253 miles or 407 km).

The city lies within the [[Eastern Interconnection]] rather than the [[Texas Interconnection]] making it part of only 15% of the state to lie outside of that [[power grid]].

====City layout====
The city is bisected along a north-south axis by East End Blvd. ([[US 59]]). The eastern half of the city is bisected along an east-west axis by [[U.S. Highway 80|US 80]] which east of its intersection with US 59 is called Victory Drive and west of US 59 is named Grand Ave. The Harrison County Airport and Airport Baseball Park are located to the south of Victory Dr. off of Warren Dr.
[[Image:Maplecroft.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Maplecroft'' the centerpiece of the [[Starr Family Home State Historic Site]] in downtown.]]
To the west of US 59, south of Pinecrest Dr. are older [[suburbs]]; north of Pinecrest Dr. the oldest portion of the city stretches northward over seven hills. This portion of the city radiates out from downtown which is centered on the Old Harrison County Courthouse in Peter Whetstone Square. Immediately to the north of the square is the [[Ginocchio National Historic District]] where the city's [[Amtrak]] Terminal is located. This region of the city is bisected along an east-west by Grand Ave. ([[US 80]]). Spreading out from downtown is a belt of [[Antebellum]] and [[Victorian era|Victorian]] homes centered on Rusk and Houston Streets.

To the west of downtown are some of the oldest [[African-American]] neighborhoods in [[Texas]], centered around [[Wiley College]]. To the north of Grand Ave. (US 80) are neighborhoods that were built largely by employees of the [[Texas and Pacific Railway]]. In addition to the Ginocchio National Historic District, this part of the city is home to [[East Texas Baptist University]], and three historic cemeteries: Marshall Cemetery, Powder Mill Cemetery, and Greenwood, which is divided into [[Christian]] and [[Jew]]ish sections.
