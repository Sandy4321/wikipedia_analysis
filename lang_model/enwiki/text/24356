The '''Danish Gambit''', known as the ''{{lang|de|Nordisches Gambit}}'' (Nordic Gambit) in German, and the ''{{lang|nl|Noords Gambiet}}'' (Northern Gambit) in Dutch, is a [[chess opening]] that begins with the moves 1.[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4|e4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e5|e5]] 2.[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e5/2. d4|d4]] [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e5/2. d4/2...exd4|exd4]] 3.[[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e5/2. d4/2...exd4/3. c3|c3]]. White will sacrifice one or two pawns for the sake of rapid development and the attack. However, with care, Black can accept one or both pawns safely, or simply decline the gambit altogether with good chances.

Although it may have been known earlier, [[Denmark|Danish]] player [[Martin Severin From]] essayed the [[gambit]] in the [[Paris 1867 chess tournament]] and he is usually given credit for the opening.  The Danish Gambit was popular with masters of the attack including [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]], [[Frank Marshall|Marshall]], [[Joseph Henry Blackburne|Blackburne]], and [[Jacques Mieses|Mieses]], but as more defensive lines for Black were discovered and improved, it lost favor in the 1920s. Today it is rarely played in top-level chess.

==History==
From the very beginning the nomenclature of the Danish Gambit was very confusing. The idea stems from a famous correspondence game London-Edinburgh, 1824: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4 Bc5 5.c3 Qe7 6.0-0 dxc3 7.Nxc3. The Swede [[Hans Lindehn]] played 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 on a regular basis from 1857 at latest. He defeated the later World Champion [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] with his gambit in London, 1864. It is possible, that Severin From met Lindehn in Paris in this period and learned about the gambit there. According to Graham Burgess, in [[Denmark]] itself, the opening is called the Nordic Gambit.<ref>Graham Burgess, ''The Mammoth Book of Chess'', Carroll & Graf, 1997, p. 114. ISBN 0-7867-0725-9.</ref>

Many games transposed to the [[G<U+00F6>ring Gambit]], as Nf3 for White and ...Nc6 for Black are very logical moves. As Carl Theodor G<U+00F6>ring also used to play the double gambit, there was hardly any difference.

Remarkably enough, the idea to sacrifice just one pawn (Nxc3) is older in the G<U+00F6>ring Gambit than in the Danish. [[Paul Morphy]] encountered it at the first USA-Congress of 1857 against [[Alexander Meek]]. In the Danish, especially Alexander Alekhine applied 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3, but on unimportant occasions.

|Main line after 5.Bxb2}}

The Danish Gambit is a variation of the [[Center Game]] that is important enough to be treated on its own.
It is C21 in the [[ECO]] classification.
 
After 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3, Black can safely decline the gambit with 3...d6, 3...Qe7, or 3...d5 (S<U+00F6>rensen Defense or Capablanca Defence).  If Black enters the Danish Gambit Accepted with 3...dxc3, the main possibilities are

*4.Nxc3 (Alekhine Variation)
**4...d6 5.Bc4 Nc6 6.Nf3 (G<U+00F6>ring Gambit, by [[transposition (chess)|transposition]])
**4...Bc5 5.Bc4 Nc6 6.Nf3 (G<U+00F6>ring Gambit, by transposition)
**4...Nc6 5.Bc4 and 6.Nf3 (G<U+00F6>ring Gambit, by transposition)
**4...Bb4 5.Bc4 (5.Qd4 is an independent option) Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 d6 7.Qb3 Qe7 8.Ne2 Alekhine-Pomar, clock simul Madrid 1943
*4.Bc4 (Lindehn's continuation)
**4...d6 5.Nxc3 (also G<U+00F6>ring Gambit, by transposition)
**4...cxb2 5.Bxb2
***5...Bb4+ 6.Kf1 or 6.Nc3
***5...d6 6.Qb3
***5...d5 ([[Carl Schlechter|Schlechter]] Defense)

Alekhine recommended that White play 4.Nxc3. This line often transposes into the G<U+00F6>ring Gambit of the [[Scotch Game]]. There are only few lines with Black omitting ...Nc6 and/or White omitting Nf3.

White can instead offer a second pawn with 4.Bc4.
The second pawn can be safely declined by transposing into the Scotch Gambit.
Accepting the pawn allows White's two bishops to rake the Black [[Chess terminology#K|kingside]] after 4...cxb2 5.Bxb2.
White will often follow up with Qb3 if possible, applying pressure on Black's b7 and f7 squares.  Combined with White's [[Chess terminology#L|long diagonal]] pressure on g7, this can make it difficult for Black to develop his bishops.

Schlechter recommended one of the most reliable defenses for Black: by returning one of the pawns with 5...d5 Black gains time to complete development.  After 6.Bxd5 Nf6 (Bb4+ is also possible) 7.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qxd8 Bb4+ 9.Qd2 Bxd2+ 10.Nxd2 c5, Black regains the queen.  Most theorists evaluate this position as equal, but some believe that the [[Chess terminology#Q|queenside]] [[Chess terminology#M|majority]] gives Black the advantage in the [[Chess terminology#E|endgame]].The popularity of the Danish plummeted after Schlechter's defense was introduced as the resulting positions are not what White generally desires from a gambit opening.  There have been attempts, especially by German correspondence player Ingo Firnhaber, to revive the gambit idea with 7.Nc3. The critical line is 7...Nxd5 8.Nxd5 Nbd7 (8...c6?? 9.Nf6+) 9.Nf3 c6 10.0-0 cxd5 11.exd5 Be7! If White instead plays 6.exd5, his light-square bishop is blocked and after 6...Nf6 7.Nc3 Bd6 Black can complete development relatively easily.

The big advantage of G<U+00F6>ring's move order (Nf3 first, before c3) is avoiding Schlechter's defence. The big advantage of 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 is the option to play a modification of Capablanca's Defence, meeting 3...d5 with 4.exd5 Qxd5 5.cxd4 Nc6 6.Be3 instead of 6.Nf3 transposing.  It also has the advantage of avoiding Blacks other options after 2.Nf3.
