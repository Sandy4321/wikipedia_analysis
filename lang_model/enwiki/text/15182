The '''Manipal Institute of Technology''' (commonly known as '''MIT, Manipal''' and '''Manipaltech''') is a constituent [[institution]] of the [[Manipal University]] that specializes in the fields of [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. MIT contains 16 academic departments and awards undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees.<ref name="overview" /> Established in 1957 in [[Manipal]], [[Karnataka]], [[India]], MIT is one of the first self-financed colleges in India.<ref name="affiliations">{{cite web | title=Affiliations, MIT | url=http://www.manipal.edu/Institutions/Engineering/MIT/AboutMIT/Pages/Affiliations.aspx|accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref>

==History==

===Foundation and early years (1957-1960)===
In 1957, [[T. M. A. Pai]] conceived of the idea of establishing an engineering college in Manipal. The Manipal Engineering College (MEC) was inaugurated on 11 May 1957 by the then Chief Minister of Mysore, [[S. Nijalingappa]].<ref name="mitguide">{{cite web|url=http://www.mitguide.com/Manipal_Institute_of_Technology/|title=MIT Guide|accessdate=5 Feb 2011}}</ref><ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.manipal.edu/Institutions/Engineering/MIT/AboutMIT/Pages/History.aspx|title=History, MIT|accessdate=16 May 2010}}</ref> For a few initial months, lectures were held at the [[Kasturba Medical College, Manipal]] campus before the infrastructure was ready at its present campus towards the end of 1957. The institute started with 25 staff members and an annual intake of 120 students for the under-graduate courses, in a campus of {{convert|180|acre|km2}}.

===Growth and expansion (1961-1999)===
[[Civil engineering]] was the first discipline to be offered at the institute, but by 1961, full undergraduate programs were also available in the areas of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]]. Housing facilities were operational from 1961 for outstation students.

The institute was originally affiliated to the [[Karnataka University]] in [[Dharwad]].<ref name="affiliations" /> In 1965, the institute affiliated itself with the [[University of Mysore]] in [[Mysore]].<ref name="prospectus">''MIT Prospectus'', inside cover</ref> More courses were added over the decades as the college expanded. The MIT, Manipal Student Chapter of the Institution of Engineers (Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering) was established in the mid 1960s. 

In 1969, Chemical Engineering was introduced as a branch of study followed by Electronics and Communication engineering. In 1973, the semester scheme was adapted and a one year post graduate diploma in industrial engineering was offered. In the same year, the Venugopala Temple, modeled on the famous Kirti Mandir in Vadodara, Gujarat was built. It is a landmark on campus. 

The MIT campus has been visited by several well-known persons at various times in its history. The Tibetan spiritual leader, [[Dalai Lama]] visited the college in 1966. The 1970s saw the visit of Smt [[Indira Gandhi]], the then Prime Minister of India.<ref>{{cite web | title=Indira Gandhi visit to Manipal | url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=32900&n_tit=News+headlines}}</ref> 

In 1974, it was renamed as '''Manipal Institute of Technology'''. MIT was brought under the purview of [[Mangalore University]] in 1980.<ref name="affiliations" /> In 1979, other branches of study such as Industrial Production and Architecture were introduced. The construction of the 4-floor library building with an area of {{convert|83000|sqft|m2}} and more hostel blocks including 7th, 9th blocks and women's hostels was completed in the 1980s. The inauguration of the swimming pool was done in 1986 and that of the floodlit basketball court at Kamath Circle in 1989.

Expansions in the late 1980s and early 1990s included the setting up of the Computer Engineering department in 1987 and the Bio-medical Engineering Department and the Printing Department in 1992. More library space and {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}} of auditorium area were also built during this period. Hostel expansion in 1990 saw the construction of the new ladies hostel  right across the Venugopal Temple. The construction the tenth hostel block, touted as one of Asia's largest hostel blocks with a capacity of about 1500, started in 1991.

In 1993, the state government of [[Karnataka]] introduced statewide measures regulating the intake of students to private institutes, including MIT Manipal, and this had a financial impact on the college because it meant that the fee structure was regulated by the government. The college was designated a ''Linguistic Minority Institute'' status between 1993 and 1999, which meant that a significant fraction of the intake was reserved for those students whose native tongue was [[Konkani language|Konkani]]. 

The '''International Center for Applied Sciences (ICAS)''' which runs twinning programs with partner universities around the world including [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], and [[Milwaukee School of Engineering]], was started in the 1990s. The twinning program follows a (2+2) model wherein the first 2 years are spent in MIT, Manipal and the later 2 years are spent at the partner university.

===Recent history (2000-present)===
In 2000, the college became a constituent institute of the Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE). MAHE was designated as a [[Deemed University]], a status that allows it to operate without affiliations to any other universities, conduct its own admission procedures, update and upgrade syllabi, tie up with foreign universities, fix its own fees and function autonomously. MAHE was renamed as [[Manipal University]] in 2007. The institute celebrated its Golden Jubilee in the year 2007 and it was marked by technical, cultural and sports events throughout the year.

[[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]], the then President of India, visited the college and interacted with the students in the year 2003.Later in 2010 the President of India [[Pratibha Patil]]<ref>{{cite web | title=APJ visit to Manipal | url=http://www.manipal.edu/melaka/media/president.htm}}</ref> 

The dawn of the new millennium brought in construction of new buildings. 2006 saw the construction of the hi-tech Innovation Center housing companies such as Phillips and EMC<sup>2</sup> and associated research and development. The 7-floor 13th Block located between the 3rd and 4th blocks for housing lady students was also completed during this period. The adjoining Lecture Hall complex was built anticipating the increase in intake and was inaugurated in the year 2006. 

Undergraduate courses in [[Mechatronics]] were added in 2006 and those in [[Aeronautical Engineering]], [[Automobile Engineering]] were added in 2008. The department of Architecture was rechristened as ''The Faculty of Architecture'' in 2006, and then as "Manipal School of Architecture and Planning", as a separate institute under the [[Manipal University]] in 2011. The annual undergraduate student intake increased from 800 spread over 12 engineering disciplines in the year 2003 to 1500 spread over 16 disciplines in 2008 (currently the institute has an intake of 2300+ students (as on July 2011)).<ref name="overview">{{cite web|url=http://www.manipal.edu/Institutions/Engineering/MIT/AboutMIT/FastFacts/Pages/Overview.aspx|title=Overview, MIT}}</ref>

The institute also played host to the 49th annual convention of the National Association of Students of Architecture (NASA) in January 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title=NASA held in Manipal | url=http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=29528&n_tit=News+headlines}}</ref>

==Campus==
[[Image:NLHic.jpg|thumb|The New Lecture Hall Complex and the Innovation Centre]]

MIT Manipal's campus is located 65 kilometres (37&nbsp;mi) north of [[Mangalore]]. The campus is located five kilometres from [[Udupi]]'s railway station and spreads over an area of 188 acres (76.0 ha) housing 10 academic buildings, and 21 residential buildings, with a total capacity of 6,080 inhabitants.<ref name="infrastructure">{{cite web|url=http://www.manipal.edu/Institutions/Engineering/MIT/AboutMIT/FastFacts/Pages/Infrastructure.aspx|title=Infrastructure, MIT|accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> There are three entrances to the campus: one near Academic Block 1, one near 12th Block and one at KC (Kamath Circle: the center of the campus). 

The catering is handled by the MIT Food Court, MIT Cafeteria, and other [[mess]]es on campus. The MIT Food Court, with a seating capacity of 1200 people, caters to the food needs of about 840 people daily.<ref name="foodcourt">{{cite web | title=MIT Food Court | url=http://www.manipal.edu/CampusLife/CampusFacilities/FoodCourts/Pages/MITFoodCourt.aspx | accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> MIT Cafeteria serves snacks and lunch, and is in the vicinity of academic buildings. Apoorva Mess, Adithya Mess, Annapoorna Mess, Akshaya Mess, Ananya Mess and Ashraya Mess serve food for students from around the world. Ananya Mess and Ashraya Mess are for women only.

Most of MIT buildings have a number (or a number and a letter) designation and some have a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to by their names and residential blocks by their numbers. The assignment of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which they were built. Many of the academic buildings are connected above ground by footbridges. However, these bridges are kept locked, except during orientation.

There is a shuttle bus service between the residential blocks and the academic blocks. The campus has continuous water and power supply. [[Manipal University|MU]]'s campus-wide wireless network was completed in May 2009 and is designed to support up to 14000 users.<ref>{{cite web | title=Wifi Manipal2 | url=http://mediacenter.motorola.com/content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=5653&NewsAreaID=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wifi Manipal | url=http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Business/Solutions/Industry%20Solutions/_Document/staticfile/Manipal%20University%20case%20study-rev.pdf?localeId=33}}</ref><ref name="osblog">{{cite web|url=http://ankurs.com/2009/02/ion-proxy-login-problem/|title=Ion Proxy Issue|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref><ref name="library">{{cite web | url=http://www.manipal.edu/CampusLife/Libraries/HealthSciencesLibrary/Pages/LibraryIntranet.aspx|title=Library Intranet, MU|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>

===Academic buildings===
The major academic buildings are in five blocks, the last one built in 2010. The heart of the campus is the massive Main Academic Block (Academic Block 1 formerly called Quadrangle) built in the 1950s. It houses most engineering departments and plays host to most functions of the college including Revels, the cultural fest, and TechTatva, the technical festival.

In addition to the engineering departments, it houses:
* the Office of the Director
* the Offices of the Associate Directors
* Student Welfare Office
* Training and Placement Cell

The adjacent Civil and Architecture block was built in the 1980s. This block houses the Faculty of Architecture, the Departments of Physics, Civil Engineering, Information and Communication Technology, Printing Technology and the Office of the Controller of Examinations of [[Manipal University]].
<!-- DIT IT "COME UP"???An <U+2018>Academic Block<U+2019> at the Manipal Institute of Technology campus which sprawls across {{convert|150000|sqft|m2}}, equipped with classrooms, conference halls and auditoriums is slated to come up by February 2010.-->

Constructed in 2006, the Innovation Centre houses the R&D arms of companies such as Phillips and EMC<sup>2</sup>. The Centre houses several computer labs with Windows and Linux platforms. In July 2009, all the academics buildings were renamed; Innovation Center was renamed as Academic Block 4, but it is still referred to by students as IC.

===Housing===
[[Image:Mithostels.jpg|thumb|16th and 17th Blocks, MIT hostels]]
Undergraduate students are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's twenty-one [[hostel]] buildings.<ref name="facilities">{{cite web|url= http://www.manipal.edu/CampusLife/Hostels/MITHostels/Pages/Facilities.aspx |title=Facilities|accessdate=2 September 2012}}</ref> Housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves at the beginning of every academic year, subject to vacancy. Priority in allotment is decided by seniority and then GPA of the student in later semesters. The construction of four new mens<U+2019> hostel buildings with 360 rooms each was completed in July 2009. Both, air-conditioned and non air-conditioned rooms are available to students. <ref name="facilities" /> Each set of rooms has a common area where students can watch [[TV]], and play [[table tennis]]. There are facilities for gym and indoor sports in certain hostels.

The total housing capacity on the MIT campus is of 6080 students, of which 75% is for men, and 25% is for women. Of this, 95% is occupied by under-graduate students.<ref name="facilities" />

Hostel security is strict about students using motorised vehicles.<ref>[http://themanipaljournal.com/index.php?news=844 "How they keep our campus safe,"] ''The Manipal Journal'', 18 March 2011.</ref>
