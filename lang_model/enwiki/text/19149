'''Alice in Chains''' is an [[United States|American]] [[hard rock]] [[rock band|band]] formed in Seattle, Washington in 1987 by guitarist [[Jerry Cantrell]] and vocalist [[Layne Staley]]. Although widely associated with [[grunge music]], the band's sound incorporates [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[hard rock]], and [[acoustic]] elements. Since its formation,  Alice in Chains has released three studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinct vocal style which often includes the [[harmony| harmonized]] vocals of Staley and Cantrell. 

Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Soundgarden]]. It was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s and sold close to 11 million albums in the United States alone. The band achieved two number-one [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums (''[[Jar of Flies]]'' and ''[[Alice in Chains (album)|Alice in Chains]]''), 11 top ten singles on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] charts, and six [[Grammy Award]] nominations.

Although the band never officially disbanded, it has been plagued by extended inactivity due to problems with substance abuse which culminating in the death of Staley in 2002. Alice in Chains reunited in 2005 and as of 2008 are working on their first studio album in 13 years with new lead vocalist [[William DuVall]].

== History ==
=== Formation ===

Following the demise of his band Sleeze in 1986, vocalist Layne Staley formed Alice N' Chainz, a band which he said "dressed in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] and played [[speed metal]]".<ref name="Music Bank">{{cite cd notes | author=Alice in Chains | title=''Music Bank'' liner notes | date=[[1996-10-26]] | cddesc=Cantrell, Jerry; Inez, Mike; Kinney, Sean; Staley, Layne; Starr, Mike | publisher=[[Columbia Records]] | catalognumber=69580}}</ref> The new band performed around the Seattle area playing [[Slayer]] and [[Armored Saint]] [[Cover version|covers]]. Staley met guitarist [[Jerry Cantrell]] while working at Music Bank rehearsal studios, where the two struggling musicians became roommates, and lived in a rehearsal space they shared. Staley's Alice N' Chainz soon disbanded and he joined a [[funk]] band who at the time also required a guitarist. Staley asked Cantrell to join as a [[sideman]].  Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley joined Cantrell's band Diamond Lie, which at the time included drummer [[Sean Kinney]] and bassist [[Mike Starr]]. Eventually the funk project broke up and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell on a full time basis. Diamond Lie played in clubs around the Pacific Northwest, often stretching 15 minutes of material into a 45-minute set. The band eventually took the name of Alice N' Chains, although they switched the ''z'' in the title to an ''s''.<ref name="Music Bank"/><ref name="Link with Brutality">{{cite web| url=http://aic.gsg2007.de/Artikel/Circus%20Magazine%20'90.html |title=Link With Brutality | author=Kleidermacher, Mordechai  |year=1990 |month=July |journal=Circus Magazine |accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref>

Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of the band at a concert, and offered to pay for [[Demo (music)|demo]] recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record the Music Bank studio in the Washington, the police shut down the studio during the biggest [[marijuana]] raid in the history of the state.<ref name="Music Bank"/> The final demo was named ''The Treehouse Tapes'', and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band [[Soundgarden]]. Curtis and Silver passed on the demo to [[Columbia Records]]' [[A&R]] representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Lenner. Based on ''The Treehouse Tapes'', Lenner signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989.<ref name="Music Bank"/>

Although Alice in Chains have been labeled [[grunge]], [[alternative]], and [[hard rock]], Jerry Cantrell identifies the band as primarily [[heavy metal]]. He told ''[[Guitar World]]'' in 1996; "We're a lot of different things... I don't quite know what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to".<ref>Gilbert, Jeff. "Go Ask Alice". ''Guitar World''. January 1996.</ref>  Alice in Chains' has cited musical influences such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Led Zeppelin]], and [[Metallica]].<ref name="Remembering Layne Staley"/><ref name="All Music Guide">{{cite web| url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:3ifwxqw5ldae~T1 |title=Alice in Chains Biography |publisher=[[All Music Guide]] |author=Erlewine, Thomas; Prato, Greg |accessdate=2007-11-28}}</ref> 

Jerry Cantrell's guitar style combines what Stephen Erlewine of All Music Guide called "pummeling riffs and expansive guitar textures" to create "slow, brooding minor-key grinds".<ref name="All Music Guide"/><ref> {{cite web |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/14253942 |title=Degradation Trip Review |publisher=[[All Music Guide]] |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>  While down tuned distorted guitars mixed with Staley's distinctive "snarl-to-a-scream"<ref name="Dirt - Guitar World"/> vocals appealed to [[heavy metal]] fans, the band also had "a sense of melody that was undeniable," which introduced Alice in Chains to a much wider pop audience outside of the heavy metal underground.<ref name="AMG Facelift"/><ref name="Staley dead-VH1"/>  

The band has been described by critics as "hard enough for metal fans, yet their dark subject matter and punky attack placed them among the front ranks of the Seattle-based grunge bands".<ref name="All Music Guide"/>  Three of the band's releases feature all acoustic music, and while the band initially kept these releases separate, Alice in Chains' self-titled album combined the styles to form "a bleak, nihilistic sound that balanced grinding hard rock with subtly textured acoustic numbers".<ref name="All Music Guide"/> 

Alice in Chains is also noted for the unique vocal harmonies of Staley and Cantrell, which included overlapping passages, and dual lead vocals.<ref name="All Music Guide"/>  Alyssa Burrows said the band's distinctive sound "came from Staley's vocal style and his lyrics dealing with personal struggles and addiction".<ref>{{cite web| author=Burrows, Alyssa |date=[[2002-05-17]] |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3778 |title=Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley dies on April 5, 2002. |publisher=Historylink.com |accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>  Staley's songs were often considered "dark",<ref name="All Music Guide"/> with themes such as drug abuse, depression, and suicide,<ref name="Remembering Layne Staley"/> with Cantrell's lyrics dealing more with personal relationships.

==Legacy==
Alice in Chains has sold more than ten million albums in the United States, released two number-one albums and 19 top 40 singles, and has received six [[Grammy]] nominations. The band ranked number 34 on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists.<ref>{{cite web| date=2000 |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists |publisher=Rockonthenet.com |accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> Alice in Chains has had a large impact on many bands, such as [[Godsmack]] who, according to Jon Wiederhorn of [[MTV]], "have sonically followed Alice in Chains' lead while adding their own distinctive edge". Godsmack singer [[Sully Erna]] has also cited Layne Staley as his primary influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453568/20020423/alice_in_chains.jhtml |title=MTV.com <U+2013> "'He Got Me To Start Singing': Artists Remember Layne Staley" |accessdate=2007-11-08 |author=D'Angelo, Joe; Vineyard, Jennifer; Wiederhorn, Jon |date=[[2002-04-22]] |publisher=MTV.com }}</ref> [[Staind]] has covered Alice in Chains' song "[[Nutshell (song)|Nutshell]]" live, which appears on the compilation ''[[The Singles: 1996-2006]]'', and also wrote a song entitled "Layne", in Staley's dedication,  on the album ''[[14 Shades of Grey]]''.<ref>{{cite web| author=Snierson, Dan |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,631523,00.html |title=Layne Staley gets ''Born Again'' |publisher=Ew.com |date=[[2004-05-07]] |accessdate=2007-01-06}}</ref> Other bands that have been inspired by Alice in Chains include [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]], [[Puddle of Mudd]], [[Smile Empty Soul]], [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Nickleback]], [[Cold (band)|Cold]] and [[Tantric (band)|Tantric]].<ref name="Remembering Layne Staley"/> [[Metallica]], who originally influenced Alice in Chains, in turn said they always wanted to tour with the band, citing Alice in Chains as a major influence on the vocal melodies for Metallica's eighth studio album ''[[St. Anger]]''.<ref name="Remembering Layne Staley"/>
