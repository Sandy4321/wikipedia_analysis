'''''Wavelength''''' is an album by [[Northern Irish]] [[singer/songwriter]] [[Van Morrison]], released in [[1978 in music|1978]]. The album had a different atmosphere from his previous albums, as it  had a more [[pop rock|pop]] oriented sound due to his heavy use of [[electric guitars]] and [[synthesizers]]. Bobby Tench and [[Peter Bardens]] were given special credit as "Special Assistance in Production."<ref>Rogan, No Surrender, p. 315</ref> 

The [[January 29]], [[2008]]  re-issued  and re-mastered version of the album  contains live takes on the songs, "Wavelength" and "Kingdom Hall" that were performed at the [[Roxy Theatre]] on November 26, 1978.<ref>[http://www.vanmorrison.co.uk/?m=Content&Content(record_id)=9e7f77a8944fa52fb858a13add2752e0 Van Morrison Official Website]</ref>

==Album's cover==
The cover on the album  was by photographer Norman Seeff (associated with [[Joni Mitchell]]'s  album sleeves)  and shows Morrison for once almost smiling and looking [[James Dean]] like  dressed in tight white trousers smoking a cigarette down to the butt.

==Recording history==
''Wavelength'' was recorded at the Manor in [[Oxfordshire]] [[England]] over several months time and then completed at Shangri-la studios in [[United States|America]].  Morrison had brought together musicians that represented almost all phases of his musical history:  Herbie Armstrong from his showband days in [[Belfast]], [[Peter Bardens]] from [[Them (band)|Them]],  [[Garth Hudson]] from [[The Band]] and [[Peter Van Hooke]] from the mid-70s.<ref>Rogan, No Surrender, p.315</ref>

==Songs==
The songs on this album also recall  various stages of Morrison's life, starting with the album opener, "Kingdom Hall" which reflected back to his childhood in Belfast when he attended services with his mother,  a practicing [[Jehovah's Witness]] at one time.  "[[Wavelength (song)|Wavelength]]" was  about fond memories of his adolescence, listening to the [[Voice of America]]. "Checking It Out" is about a relationship going wrong and being rescued by "guides and spirits along the way". "Natalia", "Lifetimes" and "Venice USA" are love songs.  "Santa Fe" which he wrote with [[Jackie DeShannon]], is Morrison's first ever collaboration to appear on an album. It segues into "Beautiful Obsession". "Hungry For Your Love" appeared in the hit 1982 movie ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]'' and has become one of the more enduringly popular songs on the album along with the title song.  Morrison plays [[electric piano]] on this song accompanied by Herbie Armstrong's [[acoustic guitar]].<ref>Hinton, Celtic Crossroads, p. 210-212</ref>Morrison also included "Hungry For Your Love" on his 2007 compilation album ''[[Van Morrison at the Movies - Soundtrack Hits]]''.

==Aftermath==
It quickly became the fastest selling album that Morrison had recorded at that time and went [[gold album| gold]] within three months.  [[Melody Maker]]  reviewed the album as evidence of Morrison's "drift into the [[American dream]]."  Morrison denied that the songs were anything but about personal experience, and were not about the country. <ref>Rogan, No Surrender, p. 316</ref> (Relocating to [[Europe]] within a few years, his work during the 1980s would not  be so "[[radio]] friendly" and so easily accessible to the casual listener.) 
With the success of the album, Morrison assembled a Wavelength band to promote it that was  similar in many ways to the abandoned [[The Caledonia Soul Orchestra]] from ''[[It's Too Late to Stop Now]]'' fame.
