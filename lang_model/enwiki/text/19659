Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States upon the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on December 10, 1898. Upon the outbreak of World War I, the [[U.S. Congress]] approved the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]], which granted Puerto Ricans a limited [[citizenship]]. As a result, many Puerto Ricans, with the exception of women, became eligible for the military [[Conscription|draft]], however they are not permitted to vote for the [[President of the United States]] who is also the Commander in Chief of the armed forces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/jonesact.html |title=Jones Act |accessmonthday=October 10 |accessyear=2006 |author= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Library of Congress |pages= |language= }}</ref>

During [[World War]] I Puerto Ricans in the "Porto Rico Regiment" were sent to guard the [[Panama Canal]] in defense of the [[Panama Canal Zone]].
