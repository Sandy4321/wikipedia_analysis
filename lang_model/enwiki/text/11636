'''''N<U+00FC>rnberg''''' was a German [[light cruiser]] of the [[Leipzig class cruiser|''Leipzig'' class]] built for the [[Kriegsmarine]]. She was named after the city of [[Nuremberg]] and had one [[sister ship]], [[German cruiser Leipzig|''Leipzig'']]. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was laid down in 1934, launched in December of that year, and completed in November 1935. She was armed with a main battery of nine {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} guns in three triple turrets and could steam at a speed of {{convert|32|kn}}. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was the longest-serving major warship of the Kriegsmarine, and the only one to see active service after the end of [[World War II]], though not in a German navy.

In the late 1930s, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' took part in the [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention patrols]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] without major incident. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, she was used to lay defensive minefields off the German coast. She was thereafter used to escort offensive mine-layers in the [[North Sea]] until she was torpedoed by a British [[submarine]] in December 1939. She was thereafter used as a [[training ship]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] for most of the rest of the war, apart from a short deployment to Norway from November 1942 to April 1943. In January 1945, she was assigned to mine-laying duties in the [[Skaggerak]], but severe shortages of fuel permitted only one such operation.

After the end of the war, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was seized by the Royal Navy and ultimately awarded to the [[Soviet Union]] as [[war reparations]]. In December 1945, a Soviet crew took over the ship, and the following month took her to [[Tallinn]], where she was renamed ''Admiral Makarov''. She served in the [[Soviet Navy]], first in the 8th Fleet, then as a training cruiser based in [[Kronstadt]]. By 1960, she had been broken up for scrap.

==Design==
[[File:Nurnberg 14m.jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'']]

{{main|Leipzig class cruiser}}

''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was {{convert|181.3|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|16.3|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.74|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|9040|t|sp=us}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two [[steam turbine]]s and four 7-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines. Steam for the turbines was provided by six Marine-type double-ended oil-fired boilers. The ship's propulsion system provided a top speed of {{convert|32|kn|abbr=on}} and a range of approximately {{convert|3900|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}} using only the diesel engines. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' had a crew of 25&nbsp;officers and 648&nbsp;enlisted men.<ref name=G122>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 122</ref> She was fitted with a [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] and a crane to handle two [[Heinkel He 60]] floatplanes, though these were later replaced with [[Arado Ar 196]] models.<ref name=W235>Whitley, No. 1, p. 235</ref>

The ship was armed with nine [[15 cm SK C/25]] guns mounted in three triple [[gun turret]]s. One was located forward, and two were placed in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] aft, all on the centerline. They were supplied with between 1,080 and 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for between 120 and 166 shells per gun. The ship was also equipped with eight [[8.8 cm SK C/32 naval gun|8.8&nbsp;cm SK C/32]] anti-aircraft guns, eight [[3.7 cm SK C/30]] anti-aircraft guns, and several [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling|2 cm anti-aircraft guns]], though the number of the latter changed over her career. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' also carried four triple [[torpedo tube]] mounts located amidships; they were supplied with twenty-four {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo]]es. She was also capable of carrying 120 [[naval mine]]s.<ref name=G120>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 120</ref> The ship was protected by an armored deck that was {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships and an [[belt armor|armored belt]] that was {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.<ref name=G122/>

===Modifications===
After the outbreak of war, the ship was fitted with a [[Degaussing|degaussing coil]] to protect her against magnetic mines.<ref name=W235/> In 1942, the ship's aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed. Throughout the war, her radar suite was upgraded; in March 1941, she was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed.<ref>Whitley, p. 40</ref> The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set was replaced by the short-range [[Hohentwiel (Radar)|FuMO 63 ''Hohentwiel'']] 50-centimeter radar. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was also fitted with four [[Metox]] [[radar warning receiver]]s.<ref name=W236>Whitley, p. 236</ref>

The ship's anti-aircraft battery was improved over the course of World War II. In late 1942, a pair of Army-variant 2&nbsp;cm ''Flakvierling'' quadruple mounts were installed, one on the navigating bridge and the other on top of the aft superfiring turret. In May 1944, the navy proposed installing several [[Bofors 40 mm gun]]s, but most of these weapons were diverted to other uses, and only two guns were installed. One was mounted on the bridge and the other where the catapult had been located.<ref>Whitley, No. 1, pp. 236&ndash;238</ref> Two Navy-pattern ''Flakvierling''s were added; one replaced the Army model atop the aft superfiring turret, and the other was placed in front of the anti-aircraft fire director. The Army-pattern ''Flakvierling''s were moved to the main deck. In December 1944, another revised anti-aircraft plan was proposed, this time incorporating the new [[3.7 cm FlaK 43]] gun, of which there were to be eight, along with two ''Flakvierling''s and ten 2&nbsp;cm twin mounts. Germany's wartime situation by the end of 1944 prevented these changes from being made, however.<ref>Whitley, p. 238</ref>

==Service history==
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-63-63, Leichter Kreuzer "N<U+00FC>rnberg".jpg|thumb|''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' before the war]]
''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was laid down in 1934 at the [[Deutsche Werke]] shipyard in [[Kiel]]. She was launched on 6 December 1934 and completed in less than a year, being commissioned on 2 November 1935.<ref>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 231</ref> The ship thereafter worked up in the [[Baltic Sea]] until April 1936, when she joined [[German cruiser K<U+00F6>ln|''K<U+00F6>ln'']] and [[German cruiser Leipzig|''Leipzig'']] for a training cruise into the Atlantic.<ref name=W41/> At this time, she was made the [[flagship]] of the reconnaissance forces of the German Navy.<ref name=W250>Whitley, No. 2, p. 250</ref> The three cruisers then returned to the Baltic for additional maneuvers. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' participated the [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention patrols]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936&ndash;39. On her initial deployment in 1936, she flew the flag of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' [[Hermann Boehm (admiral)|Hermann Boehm]].<ref name=W250/> Over the course of the conflict, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' conducted four patrols off Spain, but did not encounter any belligerent forces,<ref name=W41>Williamson, p. 41</ref> with the exception of a claimed attack by an unidentified submarine south of the [[Balearic Islands]] on 16 July 1937.<ref name=W250/>

In September 1937, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' took part in fleet maneuvers with the [[heavy cruiser]]s [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|''Admiral Graf Spee'']] and [[German cruiser Deutschland|''Deutschland'']], the light cruisers ''Leipzig'' and [[German cruiser Karlsruhe|''Karlsruhe'']], and several destroyers. The first three months of 1938 were spent in the Baltic, after which ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' went into dock for a periodic refit. In June, she went on a training cruise to Norway and returned to Germany the following month.<ref name=W41/> In August, she was present at the fleet review held in Kiel for [[Adolf Hitler]] and the visiting regent of [[Hungary]], [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Horthy]]. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' joined the fleet that was sent to [[Klaip<U+0117>da|Memel]] in March 1939 to seize the region. After completing the occupation, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' joined ''Admiral Graf Spee'', ''Leipzig'', and ''K<U+00F6>ln'' for a training cruise to the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which included several stops in Spanish ports. After returning to Germany in May, she resumed training in the Baltic.<ref name=W250/>

===World War II===
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] on 1 September 1939, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was assigned to the blockade force that was intended to prevent the Polish Navy from escaping the Baltic. Despite the Germans' efforts, several Polish destroyers and [[submarine]]s escaped to Britain, where they continued the war.<ref name=W41/> On 3 September, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' and the rest of the cruisers were withdrawn to the [[North Sea]] to lay a series of defensive minefields to protect the German coastline. She returned to the Baltic for training exercises in October. The following month, she was transferred back to the North Sea, where she was tasked with escorting destroyers laying minefields off the British coast.<ref name=W250/> On 4&ndash;6 December, the ship conducted a mining operation off [[Kristiansand]], Norway.<ref>Rohwer, p. 10</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1405-07, Kreuzer "N<U+00FC>rnberg".jpg|thumb|upright|left|''N<U+00FC>rnberg''{{'}}s forward gun turret in September 1940]]

On 13 December, while escorting a group of destroyers returning from a mine-laying operation off the British coast, the [[Royal Navy]] submarine {{HMS|Salmon|N65|6}} launched a spread of torpedoes at the German flotilla.<ref name=R101/> Two torpedo tracks were spotted heading toward ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'', and the ship turned hard to port in an attempt to evade them. One passed harmlessly ahead of the ship, but the second struck her in the bow. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' reduced speed to {{convert|12|kn}} to allow her crew to inspect the damage, when three more torpedo tracks were spotted to port. The ship immediately accelerated to full speed and turned to starboard; the torpedoes exploded in the cruiser's wake. The hit caused some minor flooding and minimal damage, but her watertight bulkheads held. The Germans spotted ''Salmon'' and briefly engaged her with ''N<U+00FC>rnberg''{{'}}s rearmost main battery turret, but to no effect. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' thereafter got underway at a speed of {{convert|18|kn}} and made for port.<ref name=W251>Whitley, No. 2, p. 251</ref><ref name=W42>Williamson, p. 42</ref> {{HMS|Ursula|N59|6}} unsuccessfully attacked the damaged cruiser the following day,<ref name=R101>Rohwer, pp. 10&ndash;11</ref> just before she entered the [[Kiel Canal]] at [[Brunsb<U+00FC>ttel]]. After arriving in Kiel, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' went into drydock at Deutsche Werke for repairs, which lasted until April 1940.<ref>Whitley, pp. 251&ndash;252</ref>

In early June 1940, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg''{{'}}s commander, ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>n zur See]]'' (''KzS'') Otto Kl<U+00FC>ber, was informed that the ship would not participate in [[Operation Juno]], a sortie by the battleships ''Gneisenau'' and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']]. Instead, she was transferred to Norway, departing Kiel on 10 June under the escort of the torpedo boats [[German torpedo boat Falke|''Falke'']] and [[German torpedo boat Jaguar|''Jaguar'']]. On 12 June, the torpedo boats were sent to [[Stavanger]] for fuel, and in the meantime, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' steamed a zig-zag course at {{convert|27|kn}} to evade any submarines that might be in the area. The following day, the 2nd Minesweeper Flotilla took over her escort duty off [[Trondheim]]. On 17 June, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' reached [[Narvik]], which was to be her base for the next month. During this period, one of her Arado Ar 196 floatplanes unsuccessfully attacked a British submarine. This was the only action the ship saw while in Norway.<ref name=W252>Whitley, p. 252</ref> On 25 July, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' and several destroyers and [[torpedo boat]]s escorted the damaged [[battleship]] [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']], which had been torpedoed by a British submarine, from Trondheim, Norway, to Kiel.<ref>Rohwer, p. 34</ref> The flotilla arrived in Kiel on 28 July.<ref name=W252/>

On 8 August, ''KzS'' Leo Kreisch replaced Kl<U+00FC>ber as the ship's commander. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' spent the rest of the year in the Baltic. The Italian Admiral Mavagini visited the ship while she was in [[Gotenhafen]] in September. A short refit was conducted at Deutsche Werke in October and November. On 15 February 1941, she was reclassified as a training cruiser and assigned to the Fleet Training Squadron, along with the other surviving light cruisers. These ships were tasked with training the crews for the [[U-boat]] arm, which was expanding rapidly to wage the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. At the start of this period, many of her crewmen were themselves transferred to the U-boat fleet.<ref name=W252/> After the outbreak of war with the Soviet Union in June 1941, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was reassigned to the Baltic Fleet, which was centered on the new battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']]. After it became clear that the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet]] did not intend to sortie, the German ships were dispersed. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' returned to her training duties for the remainder of the year. Another refit was conducted in January 1942; during this period, her aircraft equipment and aft torpedo tubes were removed, and her light anti-aircraft armament was increased. Allied air raids caused some damage, which delayed her return to service until 23 August.<ref name=W253/>

[[File:Cruiser Nuernberg underway May 1945.jpg|thumb|''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' underway in May 1945, escorted by [[RAF Coastal Command]] [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]] maritime patrol bombers]]

She thereafter conducted sea trials until October, after which she was deployed to Norway. On 11 November, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' left Gotenhafen, bound for Trondheim. She arrived there on 18 November, and remained there until she was transferred to [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogen Bay]] outside Narvik on 2 December. There, she joined the [[fleet in being]], which was, again, centered on ''Tirpitz''. ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' saw no action during this period.<ref name=W253>Whitley, p. 253</ref> On 27 April 1943, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' left Narvik for German waters via Trondheim. After arriving in Kiel on 3 May, she had her machinery overhauled.<ref name=W253/> After the work was completed in late May, she was assigned to the Training Squadron in the Baltic. Frequent crew changes kept the ship at a very low state of readiness. She remained in this duty through 1944, and she saw no action. She was not assigned to the shore bombardment units that supported the retreating German Army on the Eastern Front, unlike most of the other ships of the Training Squadron.<ref name=W254/>

At the start of 1945, she was assigned to mine-laying duty in the [[Skaggerak]], and was based in [[Oslo]], Norway. She completed only one mine-laying operation, [[Operation Titus]], on 13 January. The forces assigned to the operation included two destroyers, two torpedo boats, and a mine-layer; ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' herself carried 130 mines. Severe fuel shortages prevented any further operations. On 24 January, she steamed to [[Copenhagen]], where she remained until the end of the war, as she had only {{convert|270|LT}} of synthetic fuel oil aboard. On 5 May 1945, she received the ceasefire order, and on 22 May, the British cruisers {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}} and {{HMS|Dido|37|6}} arrived to take over ''N<U+00FC>rnberg''.<ref name=W254>Whitley, p. 254</ref>

===Post-war service===
[[File:N<U+00FC>rnberg1946Kiel.jpg|thumb|upright|''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' in Kiel in 1946, after being ceded to the Soviet Union]]

On 24 May, ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' and the heavy cruiser [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|''Prinz Eugen'']] sailed from Copenhagen under escort by ''Devonshire'', ''Dido'', and several other warships. The flotilla arrived in [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 28 May, and the German vessels remained there while their fates were determined at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. The Allies eventually decided to award ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' to the Soviet Union. To prevent the Germans from scuttling their ships [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|as they had done in 1919]], the Allies formally seized the vessels on 19 December, while ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' was in drydock. That day, the ship's Soviet crew came aboard. On 2 January, the Soviets took their seized warships, which also included the [[target ship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}}, ''Hessen'''s radio-control vessel [[SMS V185|''Blitz'']], the destroyer [[German destroyer Z15 Erich Steinbrinck|Z15 ''Erich Steinbrinck'']], and the torpedo boats ''T33'' and ''T107'', to [[Liep<U+0101>ja|Libau]] in present-day [[Latvia]].<ref name=W254/><ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 176</ref>

The Soviet Navy examined the ship in great detail after she arrived in Libau. The cruiser was then renamed ''Admiral Makarov'' and assigned to the 8th Fleet, based in [[Tallinn]]. In late 1948, she became the flagship of the 8th Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral [[Fyodor Zozulya|F. V. Zozulya]]. In the early 1950s, three new {{sclass-|Chapayev|cruiser|1}}s entered service, which prompted the Soviet Navy to withdraw ''Admiral Makarov'' from front line duties. She returned to her old job as a training cruiser, this time based in [[Kronstadt]] in mid-1954. During this period, most of her light anti-aircraft armament was removed, and new radars were installed. Her ultimate fate is unclear; she appears to have been placed out of service by May 1959, and was scrapped some time thereafter, reportedly by mid-1960. Nevertheless, she was the longest-surviving major warship of the Kriegsmarine, and the only one to see active service after the end of the war.<ref>Whitley, p. 255</ref>
