'''Jainism''' (pronounced {{IPA|[d<U+0292><U+025B><U+02D0>n<U+026A>z<U+0259>m]}}), traditionally known as ''Jaina dharma'', is an [[Indian religions|Indian religion]] that prescribes a path of non-violence towards all living beings. It is one of the oldest religions of the world.<ref name="Shah1998">{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|p=8}}</ref> It represents ''[[shramana]]'' tradition of ancient India and some connect it to [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].  Tradition says that this belief has been preached by a succession of twenty-four propagators of faith known as ''tirthankara''. [[Rishabha|Adinatha]] was the first ''tirthankara'' while [[Mahavira]] was the last. Some kings like [[Kharavela]] were responsible for the propagation of Jainism. However, the religion began to decline due to the growth of [[Hinduism]] and oppression by [[Muslim]] invaders. Currently, Jainism is divided into two major sects; [[Digambara]] and [[Svetambara]]. Jainism emphasises spiritual independence and equality between all forms of life. Practitioners of this religion believe that non-violence and self-control is the means by which they can obtain liberation from the cycle of reincarnations.

Jainism is a religious minority in India, with 4.2 million followers, and has adherents in immigrant communities in [[Jainism in Belgium|Belgium]], the [[Jainism in the United States|United States]], in [[Jainism in Canada|Canada]], [[Jainism in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jainism in Japan|Japan]] and [[Jainism in Singapore|Singapore]].<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999| p=271}}</ref> Jains have the highest degree of literacy for a religious community in India,<ref name="pib">{{Citation|url=http://pib.nic.in/release/rel_print_page1.asp?relid=3724|title=Census 2001 Data on religion released|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref> and their manuscript libraries are the oldest in the country.<ref name="Dundas 2002 83">{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=83}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of Jainism}}

Jainism is a representative of the ''[[shramana]]'' tradition, which was a non-Vedic movement parallel to the [[historical Vedic religion]]. Each of these streams of ancient Indian religion influenced the other. The ''shramana'' tradition was responsible for the related concepts of ''[[sa<U+1E43>s<U+0101>ra]]'' and ''[[moksha]]''.<ref name="Shah1998" /> There is also reference to Rishabha, the first ''jaina tirthankara'', in Vedic literature.<ref name="Sangave2001" />

The depiction of nude male figures in standing meditative positions was prevalent in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], showing connections with Jainism.<ref>{{harvnb|Rankin|2010|p=44}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sangave|2001|pp=107<U+2013>108}}</ref> Ram Prasad Chanda, who supervised Indus Valley Civilisation excavations, states:<ref>{{harvnb|Chatterjee|1932|p=159}}</ref>
{{quote|Not only the seated deities on some of the Indus seals are in yoga posture and bear witness to the prevalence of Yoga in the Indus Valley Civilisation in that remote age, the standing deities on the seals also show Kayotsarga (a standing or sitting posture of meditation) position. The Kayotsarga posture is peculiarly Jain. It is a posture not of sitting but of standing. In the Adi Purana Book XV III, the Kayotsarga posture is described in connection with the penance of Rishabha.}}

[[Parsva|P<U+0101>r<U+015B>va]] is the earliest ''tirthankara'' who can be reliably dated; he lived in the 9th century BCE.<ref>{{harvnb|Charpentier|1922|page=153}}</ref> Tradition says that Mahavira's parents followed his teachings. However, he cannot be regarded as the founder of Jainism. Herman Jacobi, a noted indologist, writes:<ref name="Sangave2001">{{harvnb|Sangave|2001|p=131}}</ref>
{{quote|There is nothing to prove that Parshva was the founder of Jainism. Jain tradition is unanimous in making Rishabha the first tirthankara as its founder and there may be something historical in the tradition which makes him the first tirthankara.}} 

In the 6th century BCE, Vardhamana [[Mahavira]] became one of the most influential teachers of Jainism.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fisher|first=Mary Pat|title=Living Religions|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Upper Saddle River|edition = 7th|page=120}}</ref> He built up a large group of disciples who learned and followed his teachings. The disciples referred to him as ''{{lang|hi-latin|jina}}'', which literally means ''conqueror''. His later followers used a derivation of this title to refer to themselves: ''Jain'', followers of the ''{{lang|hi-latin|jina}}''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sangave|2001|pp=100<U+2013>101}}</ref>

During the 4th century BCE, the [[Mauryan dynasty]] came to power. The first Mauryan emperor, [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]], became a Jain in the latter part of his life. He was a disciple of Badhrabahu, a Jain [[<U+0101>c<U+0101>rya]] who was responsible for propagation of Jainism in south India.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|p=42}}</ref> The warrior emperor [[Kharavela]]<ref>{{harvnb|Tobias|1991|p=100}}</ref> was responsible for the propagation of Jainism across the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The ancient city [[Pithunda]], capital of Kalinga, is described in the ''jaina'' text ''Uttaradhyana Sutra'' as an important centre at the time of Mahavira, and was frequented by merchants from [[Champa]].<ref>{{Citation

In the 4th century BCE, [[Mahapadma Nanda]] conquered Kalinga and took a statue of Rishabha from Pithunda to his capital in Magadha. [[Ashoka]]'s invasion and pro-Buddhist policy further subjugated the Jains of Kalinga. However, in the 1st century BCE the emperor Kharvela conquered Magadha, retrieved Rishabha's statue and installed it in Udaygiri, near his capital Shishupalgadh. [[Hiuen Tsang]], a Chinese traveller, (629<U+2013>645 CE) notes that there were numerous Jains present in Kalinga during his time.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|p=45}}</ref> The [[Khandagiri]] and [[Udaygiri]] caves near [[Bhubaneswar]] are the only surviving stone Jain monuments in Orissa.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=113, 201}}</ref>

===Decline===
Around the 8th century CE, Hindu philosophers [[Kum<U+0101>rila Bha<U+1E6D><U+1E6D>a]] and [[Adi Shankara]] tried to restore the orthodox Vedic religion, and Shaivite singers introduced Jains to [[Shaivism]]. Under these influences, Jain kings became Shaivite.<ref name="Glasenapp1999">{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=70<U+2013>73}}</ref> Sundara, a Pandaya ruler, is known to have persecuted about eight thousand Jain monks who refused to convert along with him. During the 11th century Brahmana Basava, a minister to the Jain king Bijjala, succeeded in converting numerous Jains to the Lingayata, a Shaivite sect hostile to Jains. They destroyed various temples belonging to Jains and adapted them to their use.<ref name="Glasenapp1999" /> [[Vishnuism]] appeared around the same time as Shaivism; the Hoysala king [[Vishnuvardhana]], also known as Bittideva, became a follower of [[Vishnu]] under the influence of [[Ramanuja]]. It is said that he ordered the Jains to be thrown in an oil mill and crushed if they did not convert. Events such as these resulted in the growth of Hinduism to the detriment of Jainism. Jains compromised by following Hindu rituals and customs and invoking Hindu deities in Jain literature.<ref name="Glasenapp1999" /> 

The Muslims who conquered India, like Mahmud Ghazni (1001) and Mohammad Ghori (1175), further oppressed the Jain community.<ref name="Glasenapp1999a">{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=74<U+2013>75}}</ref> They vandalized idols and destroyed temples or converted them into mosques. They also burned Jain books and killed Jains. Some conversions were peaceful, however; Pir Mahabir Khamdayat (c. 13th century CE) is well known for peaceful propagation of the Islamic faith.<ref name="Glasenapp1999a" /><ref>Emperor [[Akbar]] (1542<U+2013>1605) gave up eating meat after being inspired by Jains, and several [[Mughal emperors]] were polite and kind to them.</ref>

===Sects===
The Jain community is divided into two major [[sect]]s, [[Digambara]] and [[Svetambara]]. Digambara monks do not wear clothes because they believe these, like other possessions, increase dependency and desire for material things<U+2014>and desire for anything ultimately leads to sorrow. This practice restricts full monastic life (and therefore [[moksa (Jainism)|moksa]]) to males, as Digambaras do not permit women to be nude; female renunciates wear white and are referred to as ''Aryika''s. Svetambara monastics, on the other hand, wear white seamless clothes for practical reasons, and believe there is nothing in the scriptures that condemns the wearing of clothes. Women are accorded full status as renunciates and are often called ''sadhvi'', the feminine of ''[[sadhu]]'', a term often used for male ''[[Jain monasticism|munis]]''. Svetambaras believe women may attain liberation and that the ''tirthankara'' [[Mallinath]] was female.<ref name="Vallely2002">{{harvnb|Vallely|2002|p=15}}</ref>

The earliest record of Digambara beliefs is contained in the Prakrit ''Suttapahuda'' of the Digambara mendicant [[Kundakunda]] (c. 2nd century CE).<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1991|p=3}}</ref> Digambaras believe that Mahavira remained unmarried, whereas Svetambaras believe Mahavira married a woman who bore him a daughter. The two sects also differ on the origin of Mata Trishala, Mahavira's mother. Digambaras believe that only the first five lines are formally part of the [[Namokar Mantra]] (the main Jain prayer), whereas Svetambaras believe all nine form the mantra.

Excavations at Mathura revealed Jain statues from the time of the [[Kushan Empire]]. ''Tirthankara'', represented without clothes, and monks with cloth wrapped around the left arm are identified as the ''Ardhaphalaka'' ("half-clothed") mentioned in texts. The [[Yapaniya]]s, believed to have originated from the Ardhaphalaka, followed Digambara nudity along with several Svetambara beliefs.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=167}}</ref>

Svetambaras sub-sects include [[Sthanakavasi]], [[Svetambar Terapanth|Terapanthi]],  and [[Murtipujaka]]. The Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi are [[aniconic]]. Svetambaras follow the twelve [[Jain Agamas|''agama'' texts]]. Digambara sub-sects include [[Bisapanthi]], [[Kanji Swami|Kanjipanthi]], [[Taran Panth|Taranapanthi]] and [[Digambar Terapanth|Terapanthi]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|pp=74<U+2013>75}}</ref> Most simply call themselves Jains and follow general traditions rather than specific sectarian practices. In 1974 a committee with representatives from every sect compiled a new text called the [[Saman Suttam]].

==Core principles==

===Non-violence===
{{main|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Jain hand.svg|thumb|right|A symbol of Jainism consisting of a hand and a wheel reading ''ahimsa'', referring to the Jain vow of non-violence.]]
The principle of non-violence or [[ahimsa]] is the most distinctive and well known aspect of Jain religious practice. The Jain understanding and implementation of ahimsa is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in other religions.<ref>{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|p=2}}</ref> Non-violence is seen as the most essential religious duty for everyone.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=160}}</ref>

When Mahavira revived and reorganised the Jain movement in the 6th century BCE,<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=24}}</ref> ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule. [[Parshva|P<U+0101>r<U+015B>va]], the 23rd Jain ''tirthankara'' founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged,<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=19, 30}}</ref> and ahimsa was already part of the ''Caujjama'', four vows taken by P<U+0101>r<U+015B>va's followers. For centuries following Mahavira's time, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of ahimsa. In the practice of ahimsa the requirements are less strict for laypersons who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (lesser vows), than for the monastics who are bound by the ''mahavrata'' (great vows).<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=158<U+2013>159, 189<U+2013>192}}</ref>

A scrupulous and thorough application of non-violence to everyday activities, and especially to food, is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=176<U+2013>177}}</ref> The Jain diet, observed by the followers of Jain culture and philosophy, is one of the most rigorous forms of spiritually motivated diet found either on the Indian subcontinent or elsewhere. It is completely [[vegetarian]], excludes onions and garlic, and may additionally exclude potatoes and other root vegetables. The strictest forms of Jain diet are practised by the ascetics.<ref name="Shah1998a">{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|p=251}}</ref>  For Jains, [[lacto-vegetarianism]] is mandatory: food which contains even small particles of the bodies of dead animals or eggs is absolutely unacceptable. Jain scholars and activists support [[veganism]], as the production of dairy products is perceived to involve violence against cows. Strict Jains do not eat [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]], such as potatoes and onions, because tiny organisms are injured when the plant is pulled up, and also because a bulb or tuber's ability to sprout is seen as characteristic of a living being.<ref>{{harvnb|Sangave|1980|p=260}}</ref>

Jains make considerable efforts in everyday life not to injure plants any more than necessary. Although they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for minimizing violence against plants. Jains also go out of their way not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. They rarely go out at night, when it is more likely that they might trample insects. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=161<U+2013>162}}</ref> Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Jains avoid farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and Jain farmers exist.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=191}}</ref> Additionally, because they consider harsh words to be a form of violence, they often keep a cloth for a ritual mouth-covering, serving as a reminder not to allow violence in their speech.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1987|p=20}}</ref>

Although every life-form is said to deserve protection from injury, Jains admit that this ideal cannot be completely implemented in practice. Hence they recognise a hierarchy of life that gives less protection to immobile beings than to mobile ones, which are further distinguished by the number of senses they possess, from one to five. A single-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more care Jains take for its protection. Among those with five senses, rational beings (humans) are the most strongly protected by ahimsa. Nonetheless, Jains agree that violence in self-defence can be justified,<ref name="Dundas2002a">{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=162<U+2013>163}}</ref> and that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.<ref>{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=52<U+2013>60}}</ref> Jain communities have accepted the use of military power for their defence, and there have been Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.<ref>{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=53}}</ref><ref name="Dundas2002a" />

===Self-control===
Jainism encourages spiritual development through cultivation of personal wisdom and through reliance on self-control through vows.<ref name="Buswell2004">{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=228<U+2013>231}}</ref> Jains accept different levels of compliance for ascetics and lay followers.<ref name="Buswell2004" /> Ascetics of this religion undertake five major vows:
#Ahimsa: ''Ahimsa'' means non-violence. The first major vow taken by ascetics is to cause no harm to living beings. It involves minimizing intentional and unintentional harm to other living creatures.
#[[Satya]]: ''Satya'' literally means "truth". This vow is to always speak the truth. Given that non-violence has priority, other principles yield to it whenever they conflict: in a situation where speaking truth could lead to violence, silence is to be observed.<ref name="Buswell2004" />
#[[Asteya]]: The third vow, ''asteya'', is to not take anything that is not willingly offered.<ref name="Buswell2004"/> Attempting to extort material wealth from others or to exploit the weak is considered theft.
#[[Brahmacharya]]: The vow of ''brahmacharya'' requires the exercise of control over the senses by refraining from indulgence in sexual activity.
#[[Aparigraha]]: ''Aparigraha'' is to observe detachment from people, places and material things.<ref name="Buswell2004"/> Ascetics completely renounce property and social relations.

Laymen are encouraged to observe the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, [[celibacy]], and non-possessiveness within their current practical limitations, while monks and nuns are obligated to practise them very strictly.<ref name="Buswell2004" />

===Soul and karma===
According to Jains, souls are intrinsically pure and possess the qualities of infinite knowledge, infinite perception, infinite bliss and infinite energy.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp = 104<U+2013>106}}</ref> In contemporary experience, however, these qualities are found to be defiled and obstructed, on account of the soul's association with a substance called ''[[Karma in Jainism|karma]]'' over an eternity of beginningless time.<ref name=Jaini107>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=107}}</ref> This bondage of the soul is explained in the Jain texts by analogy with gold, which is always found mixed with impurities in its natural state. Similarly, the ideally pure state of the soul has always been overlaid with the impurities of ''karma''. This analogy with gold further implies that the purification of the soul can be achieved if the proper methods of refining are applied.<ref name=Jaini107/> Over the centuries, Jain monks have developed a large and sophisticated corpus of literature describing the nature of the soul, various aspects of the working of ''karma'', and the means of attaining liberation.<ref name=Jaini107/>

Jain [[metaphysics]] is based on seven or nine fundamentals which are known as ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]'', constituting an attempt to explain the nature of the human predicament and to provide solutions to it:<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|p=177}}</ref>  
#''J<U+012B>va'': The essence of living entities is called ''jiva'', a substance which is different from the body that houses it. Consciousness, knowledge and perception are its fundamental attributes.
#''Aj<U+012B>va'': Non-living entities that consist of matter, space and time fall into the category of ''ajiva''.
#''Asrava'': The interaction between ''j<U+012B>va'' and ''aj<U+012B>va'' causes the influx of a ''karma'' (a particular form of ''ajiva'') into the soul, to which it then adheres.
#''Bandha'': The ''karma'' masks the ''jiva'' and restricts it from having its true potential of perfect knowledge and perception.
#''Sa<U+1E43>vara'': Through right conduct, it is possible to stop the influx of additional ''karma''.
#''Nirjar<U+0101>'': By performing asceticism, it is possible to shred or burn up the existing ''karma''.
#''Moksha'': The ''jiva'' which has removed its ''karma'' is said to be liberated and to have its pure, intrinsic quality of perfect knowledge in its true form.

Some authors add two additional categories: the meritorious and demeritorious acts related to ''karma''. These are called ''pu<U+1E47>ya'' and ''p<U+0101>pa'' respectively. The knowledge of these fundamentals is essential for the liberation of the soul.<ref>{{harvnb|Vyas|1995|p=50}}</ref>

==Doctrines==

===Anek<U+0101>ntav<U+0101>da===
{{Main|Anekantavada}}
One of the most important and fundamental doctrines of Jainism is [[Anekantavada|an<U+0113>k<U+0101>ntav<U+0101>da]]. It refers to the principles of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] and multiplicity of viewpoints, and to the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, no single one of which is complete.<ref name="Dundas2002">{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=123<U+2013>136}}</ref><ref name="kollerjurno">{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pages=400<U+2013>407}}</ref>

Jains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with this theory, which can be illustrated through the parable of the [[blind men and an elephant]]. In this story, each blind man feels a different part of an elephant: its trunk, leg, ear, and so on. All of them claim to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant but, due to their limited perspectives, can only partly succeed.<ref name="hughes">{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|p=115}}</ref> This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. Only ''[[Kevala Jnana|Kevalis]]''<U+2014>omniscient beings<U+2014>can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=91}}</ref> Accordingly, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]].<ref name="Dundas2002" />

''Anek<U+0101>ntav<U+0101>da'' encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties. Proponents of ''anek<U+0101>ntav<U+0101>da'' apply this principle to [[religion]]s and [[philosophy|philosophies]], reminding themselves that any of these<U+2014>even Jainism<U+2014>that clings too dogmatically to its own tenets is committing an error based on its limited point of view.<ref name="Ronald">{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| accessdate= 12 November 2012| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The principle of ''anek<U+0101>ntav<U+0101>da'' also influenced [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] to adopt principles of religious tolerance, {{IAST|''ahi<U+1E43>s<U+0101>''}} and ''[[satyagraha]]''.<ref name = "hay">{{harvnb|Sethia|2004|pp=166<U+2013>167}}</ref>

===Sy<U+0101>dv<U+0101>da===
''Sy<U+0101>dv<U+0101>da'' is the theory of [[Conditional sentence|conditioned]] [[Predicate (grammar)|predication]], which recommends the expression of ''anek<U+0101>nta'' by prefixing the epithet ''Sy<U+0101>d'' to every phrase or expression.<ref>{{harvnb|Sangave|2006|p=48}}</ref> ''Sy<U+0101>dv<U+0101>da'' is not only an extension of ''anek<U+0101>nta'' into [[ontology]], but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term ''sy<U+0101>d'' is "perhaps" or "maybe", but in the context of ''sy<U+0101>dv<U+0101>da'' it means "in some ways" or "from some perspective". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express its nature fully. The term ''"sy<U+0101>t"'' should therefore be prefixed to each proposition, giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing dogmatism from the statement.<ref>{{harvnb|Koller|2000|pp=400<U+2013>407}}</ref> Since it comprises seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, ''sy<U+0101>dv<U+0101>da'' is known as ''saptibha<U+1E45>g<U+012B>n<U+0101>ya'' or the theory of seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as ''[[saptabhangi|saptibha<U+1E45>g<U+012B>]]'', are:<ref name = "grimes">{{harvnb|Sangave|2006|pp=48<U+2013>50}}</ref>
#''sy<U+0101>d-asti''<U+2014>in some ways, it is;
#''sy<U+0101>d-n<U+0101>sti''<U+2014>in some ways, it is not;
#''sy<U+0101>d-asti-n<U+0101>sti''<U+2014>in some ways, it is, and it is not;
#''{{IAST|sy<U+0101>d-asti-avaktavya<U+1E25>}}''<U+2014>in some ways, it is, and it is indescribable;
#''{{IAST|sy<U+0101>d-n<U+0101>sti-avaktavya<U+1E25>}}''<U+2014>in some ways, it is not, and it is indescribable;
#''{{IAST|sy<U+0101>d-asti-n<U+0101>sti-avaktavya<U+1E25>}}''<U+2014>in some ways, it is, it is not, and it is indescribable;
#''{{IAST|sy<U+0101>d-avaktavya<U+1E25>}}''<U+2014>in some ways, it is indescribable.

Each of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time, space, substance and mode.<ref name="grimes" /> To ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of [[dogmatism]].<ref name="kollerjurno"/>

===Nayav<U+0101>da===
''Nayav<U+0101>da'' is the theory of partial standpoints or viewpoints.<ref name="Grimes202">{{harvnb|Sangave|2006|pp=50<U+2013>51}}</ref> ''Nayav<U+0101>da'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words: ''naya'' ("partial viewpoint") and ''v<U+0101>da'' ("[[school of thought]] or debate"). It is used to arrive at a certain [[inference]] from a point of view. Every object has infinite aspects, but when we describe one in practice, we speak only of relevant aspects and ignore the irrelevant.<ref name="Grimes202" /> This does not deny the other attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective. As a type of [[critical philosophy]], ''nayav<U+0101>da'' holds that philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints, and the standpoints we adopt are "the outcome of purposes that we may pursue"<U+2014>although we may not realise it. While operating within the limits of language and perceiving the complex nature of reality, M<U+0101>hav<U+012B>ra used the language of ''nayas''. ''Naya'', being a partial expression of truth, enables us to comprehend reality part by part.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998b|p=80}}</ref>

===Cosmology===
{{Main|Jain cosmology}}

Jain beliefs postulate that the universe was never created, nor will it ever cease to exist. It is independent and self-sufficient, and does not require any superior power to govern it. Elaborate description of the shape and function of the physical and metaphysical universe, and its constituents, is provided in the canonical [[Jain texts]], in commentaries and in the writings of the Jain philosopher-monks. The early Jains contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed detailed hypotheses concerning various aspects of astronomy and cosmology.<ref><U+201C>This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone; It is self sustaining, without any base or support<U+201D> <U+201C>Nishpaadito Na Kenaapi Na Dhritah Kenachichch Sah Swayamsiddho Niradhaaro Gagane Kimtvavasthitah<U+201D> [Yoga<U+015B><U+0101>stra of <U+0100>c<U+0101>rya Hemacandra 4.106] Tr by Dr. A. S. Gopani</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=241}}</ref>

According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into three parts, the upper, middle, and lower worlds, called respectively ''urdhva loka'', ''madhya loka'', and ''adho loka''.<ref name="Shah, Natubhai 1998. p. 25">{{harvnb|Shah|1998b|p=25}}</ref> It is made up of six constituents:<ref name=autogenerated2>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=178<U+2013>182}}</ref> ''J<U+012B>va'', the living entity; ''Pudgala'', matter; ''Dharma tattva'', the substance responsible for motion; ''Adharma tattva'', the substance responsible for rest; ''Ak<U+0101><U+015B>a'', space; and ''K<U+0101>la'', time.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

Time is beginningless and eternal; the cosmic wheel of time, called ''k<U+0101>lacakra'', rotates ceaselessly. It is divided into halves, called ''utsarpi<U+1E47><U+012B>'' and ''avasarpi<U+1E47><U+012B>''.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=124}}</ref> ''Utsarpi<U+1E47><U+012B>'' is a period of progressive prosperity, where happiness increases, while ''avsarpi<U+1E47><U+012B>'' is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=271<U+2013>272}}</ref>

Jainism "views animals and life itself in an utterly different light, reflecting an indigenous Asian scientific analysis that yields a different definition of the soul, the human person, the structure of the cosmos, and ethics."<ref> {{Citation | title = The Living Cosmos of Jainism: A Traditional Science Grounded in Environmental Ethics | journal = Daedalus: Religion and Ecology: Can the Climate Change? | date = Fall 2001 | first = Christopher Key | last = Chapple | volume = 130 | issue = 4 | pages = 207<U+2013>224}}</ref>

==Prominent figures==
[[Image:mahavir.jpg|thumb|right|Sculpture of [[Mahavira]]]]
According to Jain legends, sixty-three illustrious beings called ''Salakapurusas'' have appeared on earth.<ref name=devdutt>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp=134<U+2013>135}}</ref>  The Jain universal history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=12}}</ref> They comprise twenty-four ''[[Tirthankar|t<U+012B>rtha<U+1E45>karaa]]'', twelve ''cakravart<U+012B>'', nine ''baladeva'', nine ''v<U+0101>sudeva'' and nine ''prativ<U+0101>sudeva''.<ref name=devdutt/>

''T<U+012B>rtha<U+1E45>kara'' are the human beings who help others to achieve liberation. They propagate and revitalize ''Jaina'' faith and become role-models for those seeking spiritual guidance. They reorganize the fourfold Jain order that consists of monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|pp=2<U+2013>3}}</ref> ''Jaina'' tradition identifies [[Rishabha]] (also known as Adinath) as the first ''tirthankara''. The last two ''tirthankara'', P<U+0101>r<U+015B>va and Mahavira, are historical figures whose existence is recorded.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|pp=21<U+2013>28}}</ref>

A ''cakravarti'' is an emperor of the world and lord of the material realm.<ref name=devdutt/> Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the vastness of the cosmos. ''Jaini [[puranas]]'' give a list of twelve ''cakravarti''. They are golden in complexion.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1987|p=72}}</ref> One of the greatest ''cakravarti'' mentioned in ''Jaina'' scriptures is Bharata; tradition says that India came to be known as ''Bharata-varsha'' in his memory.

There are nine sets of ''baladeva'', ''v<U+0101>sudeva'' and ''prativ<U+0101>sudeva''. Certain Digambara texts refer to them as ''balabhadra'', ''narayana'' and ''pratinarayana'', respectively. The origin of this list of brothers can be traced to the ''Jinacaritra'' by [[Bhadrabahu]] (c. 3rd<U+2013>4th century BCE).<ref name=jaini2000>{{harvnb|Jaini|2000|p=377}}</ref> ''Baladeva'' are non-violent heroes, ''vasudeva'' are violent heroes and ''prativ<U+0101>sudeva'' can be described as villains. According to the legends, the ''vasudeva'' ultimately kill the ''prativasudeva''. Of the nine ''baladeva'', eight attain liberation and the last goes to heaven. The ''vasudeva'' go to hell on account of their violent exploits, even if these were intended to uphold righteousness.<ref name="Shah1987">{{harvnb|Shah|1987|pp=73<U+2013>76}}</ref>

==Community==
With 4.2 million followers,<ref name="pib" /> Jainism is among the smallest of the [[Major religious groups|major world religions]]. Jains live throughout India. [[Jainism in Maharashtra|Maharashtra]], [[Jainism in Rajasthan|Rajasthan]] and [[Jainism in Gujarat|Gujarat]] have the largest Jain populations among Indian states. [[Jainism in Karnataka|Karnataka]], [[Tamil Jain|Tamil Nadu]], [[Jainism in Bundelkhand|Bundelkhand]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] also have relatively large Jain populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/census_data_2001/census_data_online/social_and_cultural/Religion.aspx|title=2001 Census of India |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|author=Office of registrar general and census commissioner|year=2001}}</ref> Outside India, the [[Jainism in the United States|United States]], the [[Jainism in Europe|United Kingdom]], [[Jainism in Canada|Canada]], and Kenya have large Jain communities. Jainism is presently a strong faith in the United States, and several dozen Jain temples have been built there, primarily by the Gujarati community. [[American Jainism]] accommodates all the sects. Small Jain communities exist in Nepal, Sri Lanka, South Africa, [[Jainism in Japan|Japan]], Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Fiji, and Suriname. In Belgium, the very successful Indian diamond community in [[Antwerp]], almost all of whom are Jain, opened the largest Jain temple outside India in 2010, to strengthen Jain values in and across Western Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Wiley|2009|p=19}}</ref>

==Literature==
The fourteen [[Purvas]] was a body of Jain scriptures preached by ''tirthankara'' of Jainism. These teachings were memorized and passed on through the ages, but became fairly vulnerable and were lost within a thousand years of Lord Mahavira's nirvana (liberation) due to famine.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp= 109<U+2013>110}}</ref>

''Agamas'' are canonical texts of Jainism based on Mahavira's teachings. These comprise forty-six works: twelve ''ang<U+0101>s'', twelve ''upanga <U+0101>gamas'', six ''chedas<U+016B>tras'', four ''m<U+016B>las<U+016B>tras'', ten ''prak<U+012B>rnaka s<U+016B>tras'' and two ''c<U+016B>likas<U+016B>tras''.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|pp= 112<U+2013>117}}</ref>

The Digambara sect of Jainism maintains that these agamas were also lost during the same famine. In the absence of authentic scriptures, Digambars use about twenty-five scriptures written for their religious practice by great Acharyas. These include two main texts, four ''Pratham-Anuyog'', three ''charn-anuyoga'', four ''karan-anuyoga'' and twelve ''dravya-anuyoga''.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|p=124}}</ref>

Jains developed a system of philosophy and ethics that had a great impact on Indian culture. They have contributed to the culture and language of the Indian states [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Karnataka]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]]. Jain scholars and poets authored Tamil classics of the [[Sangam period]], such as the ''[[Silappatikaram]]'', ''[[Civaka Cintamani]]'', ''[[Manimekalai]]'' and ''[[N<U+0101>la<U+1E6D>iy<U+0101>r]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=116<U+2013>117}}</ref> In the beginning of the mediaeval period, between the 9th and 13th centuries, [[Kannada]] authors were predominantly of the Jain and [[Lingayatism|Lingayati]] faiths. Jains were the earliest known cultivators of Kannada literature, which they dominated until the 12th century. Jains wrote about the ''tirthankara'' and other aspects of the faith. [[Adikavi Pampa]] is one of the greatest Kannada poets. Court poet to the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] king Arikesari, a [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] feudatory, he is best known for his ''[[Vikramarjuna Vijaya]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Glasenapp|1999|p=134}}</ref>
 
The earliest known Gujarati poem in ''Rasa'' genre, ''Bharateshwar Bahubali Rasa'', was written in 1185 by Shalibhadra Suri, a Jain monk.<ref name="eilo">{{citation | url=http://books.google.com/?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&pg=PA454&lpg=PA454&dq=Bharata-Bahubali+Rasa#v=onepage&q=Bharata-Bahubali%20Rasa&f=false | title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature | publisher=Sahitya Akademi | last=Datta| first= Amaresh | year=1987 | page=454 | isbn=9788126018031 | volume=1}}</ref> [[Acharya Hemachandra]] and his pupil, the [[Solanki]] ruler [[Kumarpal]], were important people in Gujarat's history.<ref name="hemchandra">{{cite web | url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Hemchandra.html | title=Acharya Hemchandra | publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics | work=University of St Andrews, Scotland | date=February, 2005 | accessdate=2013-04-25 | author=O'Connor, J J | author2=Robertson, E F}}</ref>

The oldest Jain literature is in [[Shauraseni language|Shauraseni]] and the [[Jain Prakrit]] (the Jain Agamas, the Agama-Tulya and Siddhanta texts, among others). The classical texts are in Sanskrit (''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'', Puranas, Kosh, Sravakacara, mathematical works, Nighantus, and so on).<ref name="agms">{{cite web | url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/agamas.html | title=Jain Agama Literature | publisher=Colorado State University | work=Jain Study Center of NC | accessdate=2013-04-25 |last=Shah|first=Pravin K.}}</ref> ''Abhidhana Rajendra Kosha'', written by [[Rajendrasuri]], is an encyclopedia or a dictionary available for interpreting the oldest Jain literature in Jain Prakrit, Sanskrit, Ardha-Magadhi and other languages.<ref name="nss">{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|p=65}}</ref><ref name="rsnt">{{cite web | url=http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=86158| title=Acharya Rajendrasuri: Biography | work=www.herenow4u.net | accessdate=March 25, 2013}}</ref>

Jains encourage their monks to do research and obtain higher education. Jain monks and nuns, particularly in Rajasthan, have published numerous research monographs. This is unique among Indian religious groups. The 2001 census states that Jains are India's most literate community.<ref name="pib"/> Jain libraries, including those at [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] and [[Jaisalmer]], have a  large number of well preserved manuscripts.<ref name="Dundas 2002 83"/><ref name="metmu">{{cite web | url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jaim/hd_jaim.htm | title=Jain Manuscript Painting | publisher=Heilburnn Timeline of Art History | work=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | date=January 2012 | accessdate=2013-04-25 | last=Guy|first= John}}</ref>

==Art and architecture==
[[File:Shravanabelagola2007 - 11.jpg|thumb|Bahubali monolith of [[Shravanabelagola]]]]
Jainism has contributed significantly to Indian art and architecture. Jains mainly depict ''tirthankara'' or other important people in a seated or standing meditative posture. ''Yaksa'' and ''yaksini'', attendant spirits who guard the ''tirthankara'', are usually shown with them.<ref name="Shah1998b">{{harvnb|Shah|1998b|p=184}}</ref> Figures on various seals from the Indus Valley Civilization bear similarity to Jain images, nude and in a meditative posture.<ref name="Shah1998b" /> The earliest known Jain image is in the [[Patna]] museum. It is approximately dated to the 3rd century BCE.<ref name="Shah1998b" /> Bronze images of the 23rd ''tirthankara'', P<U+0101>r<U+015B>va, can be seen in the Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai, and in the Patna museum; these are dated to the 2nd century BCE. A sandalwood sculpture of Mahavira was carved during his lifetime, according to tradition. Later the practice of making images of wood was abandoned, other materials being substituted.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998b|p=198}}</ref> 

Remnants of ancient Jain temples and cave temples can be found all around India. Decorated manuscripts are preserved in Jain libraries, containing diagrams from Jain cosmology.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998b|p=183}}</ref> Most of the paintings and illustrations depict historical events, known as [[Panch Kalyanaka]], from the life of the ''tirthankara''. Rishabha, the first ''tirthankara'', is usually depicted in either the [[lotus position]] or ''kayotsarga'', the standing position. He is distinguished from other ''tirthankara'' by the long locks of hair falling to his shoulders. Bull images also appear in his sculptures.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998b|p=113}}</ref> In paintings, incidents of his life, like his marriage and [[Indra]]'s marking his forehead, are depicted. Other paintings show him presenting a pottery bowl to his followers; he is also seen painting a house, weaving, and being visited by his mother Marudevi.<ref>{{harvnb|Jain|Fischer|1978|p=16}}</ref> Each of the twenty-four ''tirthankara'' is associated with distinctive emblems, which are listed in such Jain texts as ''Tiloyapannati'', ''Kahavaali'' and ''Pravacanasaarodhara''.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998b|p=187}}</ref> 

A monolithic, 18&nbsp;m statue of [[Bahubali]] referred to as "Gommateshvara", built by the Ganga minister and commander [[Chavundaraya]], is situated on a hilltop in Shravanabelagola in the Hassan district of Karnataka state. This statue was voted by Indians the first of the [[Seven Wonders of India]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2256323.cms |title=And India's 7 wonders are |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date= 5 August 2007}}</ref> 

A large number of ''[[ayagapata]]'', votive tablets for offerings and the worship of ''tirthankara'', were found at [[Mathura]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jain|Fischer|1978|pp=9<U+2013>10}}</ref>

==Customs and practices==

===Rituals and festivals===
{{Main|Jain rituals and festivals}}
[[File:Shravanbelgola Gomateshvara feet prayer1.jpg|300 px | thumb | right | Jains praying at the feet of a statue of Lord Bahubali.]]
[[Navkar Mantra]] is the fundamental prayer of Jainism. In this prayer there is no mention of names, including that of the ''tirthankara''. Jains do not ask for favours or material benefits from the ''tirthankara'' or from monks. This mantra simply serves as a gesture of deep respect towards beings they believe are more spiritually advanced and to remind followers of Jainism of their ultimate goal, [[nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]].<ref name="Shah1998a" />

The purpose of Jain worship or prayer is to break the barriers of worldly attachments and desires, so as to assist in the liberation of the soul. Jains follow six obligatory duties known as ''avashyakas'': ''samyika'' (practising serenity), ''chaturvimshati'' (praising the ''tirthankara''), ''vandan'' (respecting teachers and monks), ''[[pratikramana]]'' (introspection), ''[[kayotsarga]]'' (stillness), and ''pratyakhyana'' (renunciation).<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=190}}</ref> Related to the five auspicious life events of ''tirthankara'' called ''Panch Kalyanaka'' are such rituals as the ''[[Panch-kalyanak Pratishtha|panch kalyanaka pratishtha mahotsava]]'', ''[[Panch Kalyanaka#Panch kalyanak puja|panch kalyanaka puja]]'', and ''[[Panch Kalyanaka#Snatra puja|snatra puja]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=196, 343, 347}}</ref><ref name=psj>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=196<U+2013>199}}</ref>

[[Paryushana]] is one of the most important festivals for Jains. Svetambara Jains normally refer to it as ''Paryushana'', with the literal meaning of "abiding" or "coming together", while Digambara Jains call it ''Das Lakshana''. It is a time when the laity take on vows of study and fasting with a spiritual intensity similar to temporary monasticism. Paryushana lasts eight days for Svetambara Jains and ten days for Digambara Jains.<ref>{{harvnb|Cort|1995|p=160}}</ref> 

[[Mahavir Jayanti|Mahavira Jayanti]],<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|p=211}}</ref> the birthday of Mahavira, the last ''tirthankara'', is celebrated on the thirteenth day of the fortnight of the waxing moon in the month of Chaitra, which date falls in late March or early April of the Gregorian calendar. Lectures are held to preach the path of virtue. People meditate and offer prayers.

[[Deva Devali|Diwali]] is a Jain festival that takes place during the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]] in the Indian lunisolar calendar, around the full-moon day ([[Purnima (day)|Purnima]]). This usually falls in October or November. Mahavira attained his nirvana at the dawn of the [[amavasya]] (new moon). According to the ''[[Kalpasutra (Jain)|Kalpasutra]]'' by [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]], 3rd century BCE, numerous ''deva'' were present there, illuminating the darkness.<ref name="Jacobi1884">{{harvnb|Jacobi|1884|p=266}}</ref> On 21 October 1974 the 2500th Nirvana Mahotsava was celebrated by Jains throughout India.<ref name="N. Upadhye, Review 1982 pp. 231-232">{{harvnb|Upadhye|1982|pp=231<U+2013>232}}</ref>

===Fasting===
Most Jains fast at special times, particularly during festivals. A Jain, however, may fast whenever it seems appropriate. A unique ritual in this religion involves a holy fast to death, called ''[[sallekhana]]''. Through this one achieves a death with dignity and dispassion as well as a great reduction of negative karma.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1991|pp=166<U+2013>167}}</ref> When a person is aware of approaching death, and feels that all his or her duties have been fulfilled, he or she may decide to gradually cease eating and drinking. This form of dying is also called ''Santhara''. It can take as long as twelve years of gradual reduction in food intake. Considered extremely spiritual and creditable, with awareness of the transitory nature of human experience, ''santhara'' has recently been the centre of a controversy in which a lawyer petitioned the High Court of Rajasthan to declare it illegal. Jains see ''santhara'' as spiritual detachment requiring a great deal of spiritual accomplishment and maturity, a declaration that a person has finished with this world and chooses to leave.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=227}}</ref>

===Meditation===
[[File:Jain meditation.jpg|thumb|Sadhvis meditating]]
Jain scriptures offer extensive guidance on meditation techniques. Jains have developed a type of meditation called [[Samayika]], which term derives from the word ''samaya''. The goal of Samayika is to achieve a feeling of perfect calmness and to understand the unchanging truth of the self. Such meditation is based on contemplation of the universe and the reincarnation of self.<ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|pp=180<U+2013>182}}</ref> Samayika is particularly important during the religious festival Paryushana. It is believed that meditation assists in managing and balancing one's passions. Great emphasis is placed on the internal control of thoughts, as they influence behaviour, actions and goals.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|pp=128<U+2013>131}}</ref>

===Monasticism===
In Jainism, monasticism is encouraged and respected. Rules for monasticism are rather strict. Jain ascetics have neither a permanent home nor possessions, wandering from place to place except during the months of [[Chaturmas]]. The life they lead is difficult because of the constraints placed on them: they do not use vehicles and always travel barefoot from one place to another, irrespective of the distance. They do not use such basic services as telephones or electricity. They do not prepare food and live only on what people offer them.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|pp=152, 163<U+2013>164}}</ref> 

There are no Jain priests and the monks of Jainism, whose presence is not significant to most Jain rituals, should not be confused with priests. However, sects of Jainism that practice idol-worship often employ a servant, known as a ''pujari'', who need not be a Jain, to perform special daily rituals and other priestly duties.<ref>{{harvnb|Shah|1998a|p=170}}</ref>
