Francis Martin <U+201C>Frank<U+201D> Tunney was born on [[November 12]], [[1912]]. He was educated in [[Markham, Ontario]], and went to a business college after high school. His first exposure to wrestling came when he answered a classified ad for the Queensbury Athletic Club. The club required a secretary and Tunney was hired by Jack Corcoran to fill that position. <ref> National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 286, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, ISBN 1-55022-741-6 </ref> It was Corcoran who would open wrestling at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in November 1931.

At Tunney<U+2019>s request, Corcoran hired his older brother, John Tunney, to be matchmaker. <ref> National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 287, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, ISBN 1-55022-741-6 </ref>
 John would manage the wrestling promotion through most of the Great Depression while younger brother Frank was the bookkeeper. 

In 1939, Corcoran was forced to sell his promotion due to illness. John would continue to handle matchmaking duties, with notable assists from [[Paul Bowser]], [[Jack Ganson]], and [[Jerry Monahan]]. Unexpectedly, John would die from influenza on [[January 19]], [[1940]]. Frank was now left in charge and had many struggles in the early weeks. The contributions of wrestler [[Bill Longson]] would help to sell tickets while the promotion stayed afloat. 

==Whipper Billy Watson==
Of all the wrestlers who ever worked for Tunney, the one who helped to put Tunney<U+2019>s promotion on the map was [[<U+201C>Whipper<U+201D> Billy Watson]]. Tunney estimated that Watson drew more than five million people in main events of shows in Toronto. <ref> National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 201, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, ISBN 1-55022-741-6 </ref>

Ironically, Tunney had never taken Watson seriously in the early years. While Watson was touring England and Ireland, Watson had accumulated a package of newspaper clippings and promotional pieces and mailed them to Tunney. Watson discovered that Tunney had completely disregarded the package. <ref> National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 201, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, ISBN 1-55022-741-6 </ref>

Six months after Watson made his Maple Leaf Gardens debut on October 3, 1940, Tunney faced criticism that he was not willing to give Watson a push. Press writers would boast about the applause that Watson would earn, and after more pressure, Tunney booked a tournament on [[May 1]], [[1941]], in which Watson would win. As winner, Watson would become number one contender for the regional title, and the victory would prove a pivotal turning point for both Watson and Tunney.

==Elite Status==
Tunney cut Watson into the business side of wrestling. Their combined booking abilites brought huge financial windfalls for both of them. Tunney and Watson would buy into the St. Louis territory, guaranteeing the NWA World Champion exposure in Toronto. Champions such as [[Lou Thesz]] would grapple with Watson on a regular basis.

Another champion who frequented Toronto was Buddy Rogers. His reign as NWA champion would create animosity among many promoters. While Rogers was locked in for visits to key territories such as Frank Tunney<U+2019>s in Toronto, there were others who felt that promoters such as [[Leory McGuirk]], [[Jim Crockett]], [[Karl Sarpolis]], and [[Cowboy Luttrall]], were not essential enough to have Rogers visit. <ref> National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 184, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, ISBN 1-55022-741-6 </ref>

Tunney had long lasting friendships with promoters such as [[Willie Gilzenberg]] and [[Bob Marella]], better known as Gorilla Monsoon. Eventually, he would sell his promotion to [[Vince McMahon]], and his nephew Jack Tunney would become a figurehead president for the World Wrestling Federation.
