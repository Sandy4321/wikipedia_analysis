'''Julia Pastrana''' (1834<U+2013>25 March 1860) was a woman born with [[hypertrichosis]] who took part in 19th-century exhibition tours in North America and Europe. Pastrana, an indigenous woman from Mexico, was born in 1834, somewhere in the Sierra of [[Sinaloa]] State.<ref name="lermagaray">Lerma Garay, Antonio. <U+00C9>rase una vez en Mazatl<U+00E1>n.

Her ears and nose were unusually large and her teeth were irregular. This latter condition was also caused by a rare disease undiagnosed in her lifetime, namely gingival hyperplasia, which thickened her lips and gums.<ref name=NYT01/> Charles Darwin described her as: "Julia Pastrana, a Spanish dancer, was a remarkably fine woman, but she had a thick masculine beard and a hairy forehead; she was photographed, and her stuffed skin was exhibited as a show; but what concerns us is, that she had in both the upper and lower jaw an irregular double set of teeth, one row being placed within the other, of which Dr. Purland took a cast. From the redundancy of the teeth her mouth projected, and her face had a gorilla-like appearance".<ref>[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]], ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication]]'', Vol. II. John Murray, London, 1868. p. 328</ref>

==Life and career==
Pastrana was advertised and displayed as a [[Parahuman|hybrid]] between an ape and a human, as well as a "Bear Woman". She was examined several times to dispel the accusation that she was of African descent. One doctor, Alexander B. Mott, M.D., certified that she was specifically the result of the mating of a human and an "[[Orangutan|Orang Outang]]".<ref>{{cite book|author=Bondeson, Jan|chapter=The strange story of Julia Pastrana|title=A Cabinet of Medical Curiosities|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=1997|page=219|isbn=1860642284|chapterurl=http://books.google.ca/books?id=DPM8z2yDt2cC&pg=PA219}}</ref> Another, Dr. S. Brainerd of Cleveland, declared that she was of a "distinct species".<ref name="buckland">{{cite book|author=Buckland, F.T.|authorlink=Francis Trevelyan Buckland|title=Curiosities of Natural History, Vol. 2|publisher=Bentley|location=London|pages=44<U+2013>51|year=1865}}</ref> However, [[Samuel Kneeland (naturalist)|Samuel Kneeland, Jr]]., a comparative anatomist of the [[Boston Society of Natural History]], declared that she was human and of Indian descent.<ref>Born Different, p. 81</ref> [[Francis Trevelyan Buckland|Francis Buckland]] stated similarly that she was "only a deformed Mexican Indian woman".<ref name="buckland"/>

[[Theodore Lent]] (also known as Lewis B Lent) discovered her and purchased her from a woman who might have been her mother. Lent taught her to dance and play music and took her on a worldwide tour with the name "Bearded and Hairy Lady". She also learned to read and write in three languages. They married and she became pregnant.

During a tour in [[Moscow]], Pastrana gave birth to a baby with features similar to her own. The child survived only three days, and Pastrana died of postpartum complications five days later.

==After death==
Lent did not abandon the tour; he contacted Professor Sukolov of Moscow University, had his wife and son [[mummy|mummified]] and displayed them in a glass cabinet. He later found another woman with similar features, married her and named her Zenora Pastrana, becoming wealthy from her exhibition. He was eventually committed to a Russian mental institution in 1884, where he died.

The mummies disappeared from the public view. They appeared in Norway in 1921 and were on display until the 1970s, when an outcry arose over a proposed tour of the USA, and they were withdrawn from public view. Vandals broke into the storage facility in August 1976 and mutilated the baby's mummy. The remains were consumed by mice. Julia's mummy was stolen in 1979, but stored at the [[Oslo Forensic Institute]] after the body was reported to police but not identified. It was identified in 1990 and has rested in a sealed coffin at the Department of Anatomy, Oslo University since 1997. In 1994, the Norway Senate recommended burying her remains, but the Minister of Sciences decided to keep them, so scientists could perform research. A special permit was required to gain access to her remains.<ref name="lermagaray"/>

On 2 August 2012 it was reported in [[Aftenposten]] that Pastrana would finally be buried in Mexico at an unspecified date.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hun ble vist frem som <U+00AB>apekvinne<U+00BB>.
