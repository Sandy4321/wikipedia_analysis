'''Kanhopatra''' (15 th century) is a female [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Varkari]] poet-saint. She was a [[courtesan]] and dancing-girl by profession. Kanhopatra wrote [[Marathi]] [[abhanga]] compositions, which deal with her devotion to [[Vithoba]], the patron deity of the Varkaris and her struggle to balance this with her profession. Not much is known about the historical Kanhopatra's life. Much of the legends that deal with her life concentrate upon her death when she chose to surrender to Vithoba rather become a concubine of the king of [[Bidar|Bedar]].

==Life==
[[File:Vithoba Pandharpur temple chief gate.jpg|thumb|upright|The chief gate of Vithoba temple, Pandharpur, where Kanhopatra is buried]]
Kanhopatra was a daughter of a courtesan named Shyama, who lived in the town of [[Mangalvedhe]]. Kanhopatra was forced in the courtesans's life, though she detested it.<ref name = "Sellergren226">Sellergren p. 226</ref>

Later, Kanhopatra withdrew from society and lived in [[Pandharpur]], where the chief temple of Vithoba stands. She spent rest of her life singing and dancing at the temple and wrote ''ovi'' style poems as well as [[abhanga]] poems dedicated to Vithoba.<ref name = "mukherjee">''A Dictionary of Indian Literature'' By Sujit Mukherjee [http://books.google.co.in/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC&pg=PA164&dq=kanhopatra&lr=&as_brr=3&client=firefox-a]</ref>

Upon hearing the tales of Kanhopatra's beauty, the king of Bedar ordered her to be his concubine. When she refused, the king sent his men to get her by force. Kanhopatra took refuge in the [[Vithoba temple, Pandharpur|Vithoba temple]] of Pandharpur, the central shrine of god Vithoba. Kanhopatra died there in mysterious circumstances. Though legend says Kanhopatra merged with the central image of Vithoba in form of marriage with Him, other theories suggest possible suicide or homicide for rebelliousness.<ref name = "Sellergren226"/>

According to legend, as per Kanhopatra's last wishes, her dead body was laid at feet of Vithoba and then buried, near the southern part of the temple. Here, a mysterious tree rose, which is worshipped by pilgrims today.<ref name = "Sellergren226"/>

Kanhopatra's dating to c. 1428 CE is related to dating to a certain [[Bahamani]] king of Bedar, who though never explicitly named in legends, is often association with Kanhopatra's legend.<ref name = "Sellergren226"/>

==Literary Works and teachings==
[[File:Vithoba Gutenberg.jpg|thumb|upright|Kanhopatra's patron deity: Vithoba]]
Kanhopatra's [[abhanga]]s frequently portray her struggle between her profession and her devotion to god [[Vithoba]], the patron deity of the Varkaris.<ref name = "Sellergren226"/> Only 30 of her abhangas or ovis survive today.<ref name = "Sellergren226"/> Twenty verses of her poems are included in the anthology of Varkari saints called ''Sakal sant-gatha''.<ref name = "mukherjee"/> Kanhopatra speaks of her banishment from society owing to her family profession and social stature. She talks of voluptuous thoughts of others. She feels that perhaps she was beyond "scope of God's love". She acknowlegdes her God as the saviour of the fallen and tells him to save her too:<ref>Sellergren pp. 227-29</ref> 

<blockquote>
O [[Narayana]] (a name of god Vishnu, who is identified with Vithoba), you call yourself<br />
savior of the fallen...<br />
My [[caste]] is impure<br />
I lack loving faith<br />
my nature and actions are vile.<br />
Fallen Kanhopatra<br />
offers herself to your feet,<br />
a challenge<br />
to your claims of mercy.<ref>Sellergren p. 227</ref>
</blockquote>

Kanhopatra's abhangas also show a concern for her own body, and her will to "remain untouched in the midst of turbulences".<ref>Sellergren pp. 228, 234</ref> Kanhopatra deters against seeking of mere sexual pleasure.<ref name = "Ranade">Ranande p. 208</ref>

Kanhopatra also asserts the importance of repeating the names of God and reveals how the chanting of His names helped her.<ref>Sellergren pp. 232-3</ref> Kamhopatra also extols the deeds of [[Dnyaneshwar]], the first great saint of the Varkaris and his siblings.<ref>Sellergren p. 233</ref>

==Remembrance== 
Kanhopatra is formerly included in the list of ''Sant''s, meaning saints in Marathi. [[Mahipati]] devotes a entire chapter in his text [[Bhaktavijaya]] extolling her devotion to Vithoba. The prostitute-saint is cited as "an example of the real downtrodden and deserving people persons that are saved by the merciful God".<ref>Sharma p. 126</ref><ref>See ''Stories of Indian Saints'' By  Narhar Godbole for a complete translation of ''Bhaktavijaya'', for Kanhopatra see chapter 39</ref> Kanhopatra's life is also retold in a 1937 [[Marathi]] film written and directed by [[Bhalji Pendharkar]] as well as a popular Marathi drama both named "Kanhopatra".<ref name = "Sellergren214">Sellergren p. 214</ref>
