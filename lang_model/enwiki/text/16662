==Plot summary==

Michael Dori, a [[Japanese American]] teaches at Bienvenida [[Elementary School]] in [[Beverly Hills]], priding himself for the fact that his students regularly score in the top five percent of state standardized tests. However, when he's confronted with a ten-year old Japanese student with an apparent learning disability, Kai Goldman, the authoritarian teacher tries to first bond with the child through the commonality of their race, and then pushes the child too hard in class regarding multiplication tables which seriously embarrasses the boy. The next day, the child brings a gun to school. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.curtainup.com/monkeyjarla.html|title=A 'CurtainUp' Los Angeles Review: The Monkey Jar|author= Cynthia Citron|date=2008-02-03|publisher=Curtain Up}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-01-10/calendar/the-monkey-jar//|title=The Monkey Jar|author= Amy Nicholson|date=2008-01-10|publisher=L.A. Weekly}}</ref> 

The reason the child brought the weapon is the central conflict of the play. The teacher, Mr. Dori, accuses the boy of trying to get retribution for the embarrassment he felt over the incident with the multiplication tables. The child insists he was bringing the gun to impress his teacher. The weapon is an old [[Civil War|American Civil War]] relic and incapable of actually being fired, a fact Kai insists he was intimately aware. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.curtainup.com/monkeyjarla.html|title=A 'CurtainUp' Los Angeles Review: The Monkey Jar|author= Cynthia Citron|date=2008-02-03|publisher=Curtain Up}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-01-10/calendar/the-monkey-jar//|title=The Monkey Jar|author= Amy Nicholson|date=2008-01-10|publisher=L.A.

Left to sort out the issue is the school's [[African American]] principal, Robert Rees, who has only held the position a few months, and Coral Bryson the specialist in charge of Kai's [[IEP|Individualized Education Program]]. Complicating the already tedious racial issue is Kai's adoptive parents, Aaron and Nancy Goldman, who are Jewish. <ref>{{cite web|last=Stanley|first=Steven|title=The Monkey Jar|date=2008-02-02|url=http://www.stagescenela.com/html/the_monkey_jar.html|accessdate =2009-10-02}}</ref>

The play, which is told from Coral's perspective, examines many school issues including race, parental involvement, and the differences in quality between public and private schools. <ref>{{cite web|last=Stanley|first=Steven|title=The Monkey Jar|date=2008-02-02|url=http://www.stagescenela.com/html/the_monkey_jar.html|accessdate =2009-10-02}}</ref>

==Reaction and Reviews==
Daryl H. Miller of the [[Los Angeles Times]] found the performances believable, but criticized the abruptness with which many of the racial and social issues are handled. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/stage/641816,0,7543611.event|title=The Monkey Jar|author= Daryl H.
