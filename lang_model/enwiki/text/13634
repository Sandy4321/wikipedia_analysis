'''''Eyes Without a Face''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les yeux sans visage'''}}) is a 1960 [[French-language]] [[horror film]] adaptation of Jean Redon's novel<ref name= "1001 Films" /><ref name="AFI">Munden 1971, p. 488.</ref> which was directed by French filmmaker [[Georges Franju]], It stars [[Pierre Brasseur]] as Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier, [[Alida Valli]] as Louise, his assistant and accomplice, and [[Edith Scob]] as Christiane G<U+00E9>nessier, his daughter.

The obsessive Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier attempts [[Allotransplantation|heterograft]]ing, via experimental surgery, to restore the face of Christiane, whose face has been horribly disfigured in a car accident. Louise lures young women to their home while in Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier's home laboratory to perform experiments on them that will restore Christiane's beauty.

During the film's production, consideration was given to the standards of European censors by setting the right tone, minimizing gore and eliminating the '[[mad scientist]]' character. Although the film passed through the European censors, the film's 1960 release in Europe caused controversy nevertheless. Critical reaction ranged from praise to disgust.

''Eyes Without a Face'' received an American debut in an edited and dubbed form in 1962 under the title of ''The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus''. It was released as a [[double feature]] with the horror  film, ''[[The Manster]]''. The film's initial critical reception was not overtly positive, but subsequent theatrical and home video re-release of the film increased its reputation.<ref name= "1001 Films"> Schneider 2005, p. 365.</ref> Modern critics praise the film today for its poetic nature as well as being a notable influence on filmmakers such as [[John Carpenter]], [[Jes<U+00FA>s Franco]] and [[John Woo]].

==Plot==
<!-- Please help keep this section brief. Every detail about the plot does not need to appear here. -->
At night just outside Paris, a woman ([[Alida Valli]]) drives along a riverbank and dumps a corpse in the river. After the body is recovered, Dr. G<U+00E9>nessier ([[Pierre Brasseur]]) identifies the remains as those of his missing daughter, Christiane G<U+00E9>nessier ([[Edith Scob]]), whose face was horribly disfigured in an automobile accident that occurred before her disappearance. Dr G<U+00E9>nessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd]]s (Alsatians) and other large dogs.

Following Christiane's funeral, G<U+00E9>nessier and his assistant Louise, the woman who had disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden. The body belonged to a young woman that died following Dr. G<U+00E9>nessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. G<U+00E9>nessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiance Jacques Vernon ([[Fran<U+00E7>ois Gu<U+00E9>rin]]), who works with Dr. G<U+00E9>nessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.

Scob's face is hidden behind a face-like mask for most of the film.]]
Louise lures a young female student named Edna Gruber ([[Juliette Mayniel]]) to G<U+00E9>nessier's home, by promising her accommodation from friends of hers. G<U+00E9>nessier chloroforms Edna and takes her to his secret laboratory, where he performs [[Skin grafting|heterograft]] surgery, removing her face. The doctor successfully grafts the skin onto his daughter's face and holds the heavily bandaged and faceless Edna against her will. Edna escapes, but falls to her death from an upstairs window. After disposing of Edna's corpse, G<U+00E9>nessier notices flaws on Christiane's face. Her face grows worse within days; the new tissue is being [[Transplant rejection|rejected]] and she must resort to wearing her mask again. Christiane again phones Jacques and this time says his name, but the phone call is interrupted by Louise.

Jacques reports the call to the police, who have been investigating the disappearance of several young women with blue eyes and similar facial characteristics. The police have gained a lead concerning a woman who wears a pearl choker, whom Jacques recognizes as Louise. Inspector Parot asks a young woman named Paulette M<U+00E9>rodon ([[Beatrice Altariba]]) to help investigate by checking herself into G<U+00E9>nessier's clinic. After being declared healthy, Paulette leaves for Paris and is promptly picked up by Louise, who delivers her to Dr. G<U+00E9>nessier. G<U+00E9>nessier is about to begin surgery on Paulette when Louise informs him that the police want to see him. While the doctor talks with the police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. G<U+00E9>nessier dismisses the police and returns to his lab, where the dogs attack him, brutally disfiguring his face. Christiane walks slowly into the woods outside G<U+00E9>nessier's house with one of the freed doves on her hand.

==Production==
In the late 1950s, [[United Kingdom|British]] horror films such as ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957) and ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Horror of Dracula]]'' (1958) were popular with French filmgoers. At the time, similar modern horror films had not been attempted by French film makers  until producer [[Jules Borkon]] decided to tap into the horror market. Borkon bought the rights to the [[Jean Redon]] novel and offered the directorial role to one of the founders of [[Cin<U+00E9>math<U+00E8>que Fran<U+00E7>aise]], [[Georges Franju]], who was directing his first non-[[documentary film|documentary]] feature ''[[La T<U+00EA>te contre les murs]]'' (1958).<ref name="Ince48">Ince 2005, p. 48.</ref> Franju had grown up during the French [[silent film|silent film era]] when filmmakers such as [[Georges M<U+00E9>li<U+00E8>s]] and [[Louis Feuillade]] were making [[fantastique]]-themed films, and he relished the opportunity to contribute to the genre.<ref name="DVD">{{cite DVD-notes

}}</ref> Franju felt the story was not a horror film; rather, he described his vision of the film as one of "anguish... it's a quieter mood than horror... more internal, more penetrating. It's horror in homeopathic doses."<ref name= "Turan p.92"/>

To avoid problems with European censors, Borkon cautioned Franju not to include too much blood (which would upset French censors), refrain from showing animals getting tortured (which would upset English censors) and leave out '[[mad scientist]]' characters (which would upset German censors). All three of these were part of the film,  presenting a challenge to find the right tone for presenting these story elements in the film. First, working with [[Claude Sautet]] who was also serving as first assistant director and who laid out the preliminary screenplay, Franju hired the writing team of [[Boileau-Narcejac]] (Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac) who had written novels adapted as [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]]'s ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955) and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958).<ref name= "Turan p.92">Turan 2005, p. 92.</ref> The writers shifted the novel's focus from Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier's character to that of his daughter, Christiane; this shift revealed the doctor's character in a more positive and understandable light and helped to avoid the censorship restrictions.<ref name="DVD"/>

For his production staff, Franju enlisted people with whom he had previously worked on earlier projects. [[Cinematographer]] [[Eugen Sch<U+00FC>fftan]], best remembered for developing the [[Sch<U+00FC>fftan process]], was chosen to render the visuals of the film. Sch<U+00FC>fftan had worked with Franju on ''La T<U+00EA>te Contre les Murs'' (1958).<ref name="LesTeteProduction">[[Allmovie]].

==Cast==
* '''[[Pierre Brasseur]]''' as '''Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier''': a University professor, physician and father of Christiane. G<U+00E9>nessier experiments on his pet dogs and performs heterograft surgeries on women to try and restore the face of his daughter Christiane. Brasseur previously worked with director [[Georges Franju]] in the [[drama film|drama]], ''[[La T<U+00EA>te contre les murs]]'' (1958), again in a leading role playing a doctor.<ref name="latete">Erickson, Hal.

* '''[[Edith Scob]]''' as '''Christiane G<U+00E9>nessier''': the daughter of Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier. Christiane's face was damaged in a car accident caused by her father.

Like Brasseur, Scob was also cast by Franju in ''La T<U+00EA>te Contre les Murs'', but in a  minor role.<ref name="latete"/> Scob later worked with Franju on four later films.<ref name="franjuscob">[http://imdb.com/WorkedWith?name=Scob%2C+Edith&as=b&with=e "Edith Scob (Actress)."] imdb.com. Retrieved: February 7, 2008.</ref> 
* '''[[Fran<U+00E7>ois Gu<U+00E9>rin]]''' as '''Jacques Vernon''': a student of G<U+00E9>nessier and Christiane's fianc<U+00E9>. Jacques is unaware of Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier's criminal activity and believes Christiane is dead. After receiving a phone call from Christiane, he helps the police in investigating the crime. 
* '''[[Juliette Mayniel]]''' as '''Edna Gruber''': a young woman who becomes a victim of Doctor G<U+00E9>nessier experiments after being befriended by Louise in Paris. Edna is the first woman whose face is successfully transplanted to Christiane. While recovering from the surgery, she attacks Louise and then leaps from a window at G<U+00E9>nessier's home and dies.

==Reception==
On the film's initial release, the French critics' general response was moderate, ranging from mild enthusiasm to general disdain or disappointment, claiming it to be either a tired repetition of [[German expressionism]] or simply a disappointment of the director's leap from [[documentary filmaker]] to a genre film maker claiming the film to be in a "minor genre, quite unworthy of his abilities".<ref name="Ince51"/><ref name="senses">{{cite web

''Eyes Without a Face'' has influenced a handful of [[Europe]]an films since its release. [[Spain|Spanish]] director [[Jes<U+00FA>s Franco]] created films throughout his career that were influenced by the film.<ref name="Hawkins87">Hawkins 2000, p. 87.</ref> Franco's first was the Spanish and French co-production of ''[[Gritos en la noche]]'' (1962). Franco's variation of ''Eyes Without a Face'' concerns the efforts of a mad surgeon, Dr. Orloff, to reconstruct the face of his disfigured daughter Melissa. Inspector Edgar Tanner investigates Orlof using his girlfriend, Wanda Bronsky, as an undercover spy. Franco followed with several sequels to ''Gritos en la noche''.<ref name="allmovieOrlof">Firsching, Robert. [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:88121 "The Awful Dr. Orlof."] allmovie.com. Retrieved: February 2, 2008.</ref> He made one more film strongly influenced by the Franju film, ''[[Faceless (film)|Faceless]]'' (1988). ''Faceless'' has a similar plot involving  beautiful women who are abducted by Dr. Flamand's ([[Helmut Berger]]) female assistant and kept hostage. The doctor uses the skin of the women to perform plastic surgery on his disfigured sister, but the experiments leave the victims mutilated and dead.<ref name="allmovieFaceless">Pavlides, Dan. [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:119726 "Faceless."] allmovie.com. Retrieved: February 2, 2008.</ref> The 1961 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] ''[[Atom Age Vampire]]'' was also influenced by ''Eyes Without a Face'' with a doctor attempting to take the faces of other women to repair his daughter's face.<ref name="allmovieAtomage">Binion, Cavett. [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:119726 "Atom Age Vampire."] allmovie.com. Retrieved: March 19, 2009.</ref> These homages are seen in the plot line of a police lieutenant who is investigating the circumstances behind the death of a young girl whose body has scars around the eyes. The lieutenant's investigation eventually leads him to a plastic surgery clinic, a similar plot motivation to ''Eyes Without a Face''.<ref name="allmovieChrysalis">Buchanan, Jason. [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:88121 "Chrysalis."] allmovie.com. Retrieved: February 2, 2007.</ref>

The film also influenced [[United States|American]] film productions. [[John Carpenter]] has suggested that ''Eyes Without a Face'' inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] character in the popular [[slasher film|slasher]] [[film series]] ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]''. Carpenter recalls that the film crew "didn't have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don't know why I wrote that down, why [[Debra Hill|Debra]] and I decided on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called ''Eyes Without a Face''".<ref name="CutAbove">Carpenter, John. ''A Cut Above the Rest (Halloween: 25th Anniversary Edition DVD Special Features)'' (DVD  Region 2). [[Starz Home Entertainment|Anchor Bay]], 2003.</ref>

[[DVD]] film reviews have suggested the film influenced  director [[John Woo]]; critics have compared the graphic detail of the face transplant scene in Woo's [[action film]] ''[[Face/Off]]'' (1997) to  the  face transplant scene in ''Eyes Without a Face'' and noted the similarity.<ref name="dvdjournal">Mark Bourne.

Retrieved: January 1, 2007.</ref> Another resemblance  is Woo's trademark use of white [[Columbidae|doves]] in his films that is similar to the character Christiane's dove-laden escape in the film's finale.<ref name="dvdjournal"/>
