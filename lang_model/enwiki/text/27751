The '''10th Boat Race''' took place on the [[River Thames]] on 15 December 1849.  Typically held annually, the event is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].  The race was won by Oxford who triumphed over Cambridge after they were disqualified.  It is the only time the [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] has been held twice in a calendar year, and as of 2014 remains the only time the event has been decided as a result of a disqualification.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = The causes of our defeat were partial want of condition, a bad boat (built by Hall), and bad steering.  We led from the moment of starting to Chiswick Eyot; but here our coxswain took us over the back-water on the Surrey side, and without any apparent diminution in our efforts, the boat seemed to stop almost dead, the Cantabs came up in the midsream and tide, and passed like a shot.  The race was then at an end.

Cambridge had beaten Oxford "easily" in the [[The Boat Race 1849 (March)|race earlier that year]].  It was as a result of the manner of the defeat, and with doubts over the construction of the Oxford boat that they issued a challenge to [[Cambridge University Boat Club]] in October to race again in December.<ref name=early/><ref name=mac155>MacMichael, p.155</ref>  The invitation to race was "immediately accepted."<ref name=mac158>MacMichael, p. 158</ref>  Cambridge held the overall lead, with seven victories to Oxford's two.<ref name=results/>

Oxford's crew contained four rowers who had featured in the previous race in March, with Chitty, Steward, Sykes and Rich returning for the Dark Blues.  Cambridge welcomed back five rowers and the cox, George Booth.  The difference in weight between the crews was marginal, Oxford's rowers weighing an average of just under 11&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 6&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (72.4&nbsp;kg) were {{convert|0.125|lb|kg}} per man heavier than Cambridge.<ref name=mac160/>

Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Middlesex station, leaving Cambridge with Surrey.<ref name=mac162>MacMichael, p. 162</ref>  Weather conditions were poor: rain and a strong wind provided a "pitiless pelting" to spectators and the crews alike.<ref name=mac161>MacMichael, p. 161</ref>  Although pre-race betting indicated no clear favourite, the high winds were deemed to provide Cambridge with a slight advantage "as their style of rowing was deemed to be more suitable to stormy weather" and so the Light Blues went into the race as marginal favourites.<ref name=mac161/>  

Both crews were on the river before 3pm in boats constructed by Searle and Sons, described as "masterpieces of art", complete with splashboards to reduce the amount of water taken on board.<ref name=mac162/>  Cambridge made the better start and were clear by the Searles boathouse.  They increased the lead by a futher half-a-length and held it for another {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1}}, at which point Oxford produced a "marked improvement in speed" and began to reduce the deficit.<ref name=mac162/>  As Cambridge had already moved in front of Oxford, they steered back towards the Surrey shore in preparation for shooting [[Hammersmith Bridge]].  In doing so, a collision ensued, causing Oxford to come to halt.<ref name=mac163>MacMichael, p. 163</ref>  Although Cambridge made a three-to-four length headstart, Oxford's subsequent pace combined with Cambridge's wayward steering reduced the gap and by the end of the race, the boats were nearly level.<ref name=mac163/>

Immediately upon the conclusion, the race umpire, [[Thomas Howard Fellows]] of [[Leander Club]] declared the result in favour of Oxford, disqualifying Cambridge for the foul.<ref name=mac164>MacMichael, p. 164</ref>  Cambridge, although believing the foul was against them, did not object to the decision.  The Cambridge University Boat Club secretary Charles Bagot wrote: "It is much to be regretted that a foul should have taken place, as, besides rendering the race an imperfect test of the merits of the respective crews, it very much disturbed the harmony and good feeling which should exist between members of the rival Universities in such contests."<ref name=mac165>MacMichael, p. 165</ref>  As of 2014, it remains the only time that the Boat Race has been decided by a disqualification.<ref name=early>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/report/early-races | title = Early races | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 13 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/results | title = Results | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited|accessdate = 13 August 2014}}</ref>
