The '''Humboldt Fault''' or '''Humboldt Fault Zone''', is a [[normal fault]] or series of faults, that extends from [[Nebraska]] southwestwardly through most of [[Kansas]]<ref>from the [[Kansas Geological Survey]] (at the [[University of Kansas]]) [http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Oil/primer05.html site], oil geology page, accessed on December 16, 2006 </ref>

Kansas is not particularly earthquake prone, ranking 45th out of 50 states by damage caused.<ref name=KGS>[[Kansas Geological Survey|KGS]] cite of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] [http://www.kgs.ku.edu/General/News/2000/earthquake.html report], accessed on December 16, 2006 </ref>  However, the north-central part of the state, particularly [[Riley County, Kansas|Riley]] and [[Pottawatomie County, Kansas|Pottawatomie]] counties, is the most prone to earthquakes. The Humboldt fault had the largest  earthquake recorded in Kansas history. It happened near the town of [[Wamego, Kansas|Wamego]], in 1867, and was estimated at about 5.5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]]. Reportedly it was felt as far away as [[Dubuque]], [[Iowa]].<ref name=KGS/>
