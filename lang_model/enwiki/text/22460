'''Zhao Yun''' (died 229<ref name="death"/>) was a military general who lived during the late [[Han Dynasty]] and early [[Three Kingdoms]] era of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. For most of his career, Zhao served the warlord [[Liu Bei]], playing a part in the establishment of state of [[Shu Han]]. In literature and folklore, he is lauded as the third member of the [[Five Tiger Generals]].

Due to limits in historical records, many facts about Zhao's life remain unclear or unknown. The original records in [[Chen Shou]]'s ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' are only a couple of hundred words long. [[Pei Songzhi]]'s annotations provide a relatively clear, though still incomplete picture of Zhao's life.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Zhao Yun was born in Zhending, Changshan (south of present-day [[Zhengding]], [[Hebei]]). He joined the warlord [[Gongsun Zan]] around late 191 or early 192 as a commander of a small group of county volunteers. In 192, he became a subordinate of Liu Bei, who was serving as a [[major]] under Gongsun Zan then. Zhao commanded a contingent of several thousand [[Wuhuan]] cavalry under Liu Bei. He left Gongsun Zan and Liu Bei to attend his older brother's funeral later.

Zhao Yun rejoined Liu Bei in 200, when Liu was defeated by [[Cao Cao]] and was seeking shelter under [[Yuan Shao]]. Zhao Yun had a close friendship with Liu Bei, as they shared the same bed while they were living in [[Ye, China|Ye]] then. Around the same time, Liu Bei sent Zhao Yun to secretly recruit more men to join his army, while they were both still under Yuan Shao. Zhao Yun succeeded in recruiting a few hundred men, when asked, they all claimed to be Liu Bei's personal militia, and Yuan Shao was unable to know if his men deserted him for Liu. From then on, Zhao Yun followed Liu Bei in his sojourns throughout northern China.

[[File:Zhaoyunfightsatchangban.jpg|thumb|340px|"Zhao Yun's Fight at Changban" inside the [[Long Corridor]] on the grounds of the [[Summer Palace]] in [[Beijing]], China. The rider in white is Zhao Yun.]]

In 208, Zhao Yun distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Changban]] against Cao Cao's forces. Liu Bei left his family behind while fleeing during the chaos. At the same time, Zhao Yun disappeared to the north, incurring suspicion that he had surrendered to Cao Cao. When someone reported that to Liu Bei, Liu angrily threw a handaxe and said, "Zilong (Zhao Yun's [[Chinese style name|style name]]) would never desert me". As expected, Zhao Yun returned with Liu Bei's infant son [[Liu Shan]] and wife [[Lady Gan]]. For his success, Zhao Yun was promoted to "General of the Standard" (<U+7259><U+9580><U+5C07><U+8ECD>).

===Efforts in establishing Shu Han===
After the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]], Zhao Yun played a major role in conquering territories in [[Jiangnan]] for Liu Bei. He was promoted to Major-General (<U+504F><U+5C07><U+8ECD>) and appointed Grand Administrator of [[Guiyang County|Guiyang]], replacing [[Zhao Fan]], who surrendered the area to Liu Bei's forces.

When Liu Bei entered Yi Province (covering the [[Sichuan Basin]]) with his major advisor, [[Pang Tong]], he appointed Zhao Yun as the main officer overseeing his base in [[Gong'an County|Gong'an]]. Liu Bei's wife, [[Lady Sun]], was the younger sister of the warlord [[Sun Quan]], who was Liu's patron and chief ally. Emboldened by her brother's power and influence, Lady Sun and her militia often ran wild and broke the law. Liu Bei considered Zhao Yun to be serious, firm and unwavering, so he granted Zhao special authority to oversee internal affairs in Gong'an, as well to keep close watch on Lady Sun and her followers. Not long after Liu Bei left Jing Province, Sun Quan secretly summoned his sister back to Jiangdong. Lady Sun wanted to bring the young [[Liu Shan]] along with her, but Zhao Yun and [[Zhang Fei]] stopped her on the [[Yangtze River]] and retrieved their lord's son.

In 214, Liu Bei's [[Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province|invasion]] of Yi Province, governed by [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]], faced desperate resistance when he reached the city of Luo (<U+96D2>; northwest of Chengdu). There, rival generals [[Liu Xun (Liu Zhang's son)|Liu Xun]], [[Zhang Ren]], and [[Ling Bao]] played a staunch defense, and Pang Tong was killed in action. Zhao Yun accompanied Zhang Fei and [[Zhuge Liang]] to Yi Province to assist in the war.<ref>(<U+5148><U+4E3B><U+8ECD><U+76CA><U+5F37><U+FF0C><U+5206><U+9063><U+8AF8><U+5C07><U+5E73><U+4E0B><U+5C6C><U+7E23><U+FF0C><U+8AF8><U+845B><U+4EAE><U+3001><U+5F35><U+98DB><U+3001><U+8D99><U+96F2><U+7B49><U+5C07><U+5175><U+6EAF><U+6D41><U+5B9A><U+767D><U+5E1D><U+3001><U+6C5F><U+5DDE><U+3001><U+6C5F><U+967D><U+FF0C><U+60DF><U+95DC><U+7FBD><U+7559><U+93AE><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+3002><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+9032><U+8ECD><U+570D><U+96D2><U+FF1B><U+6642><U+748B><U+5B50><U+5FAA><U+5B88><U+57CE><U+FF0C><U+88AB><U+653B><U+4E14><U+4E00><U+5E74><U+3002>). Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms'', Volume 32, Biography of Liu Bei.</ref> Zhao Yun held a separate command, with his army marching from Jiangzhou (present-day [[Chongqing]]), through Jiangyang (present-day [[Luzhou]]) and Jianwei, to enter the region. The arrival of Zhao Yun replenished the tired soldiers who were worn by the three-year campaign, and together they surrounded Chengdu, forcing Liu Zhang to yield. Liu Bei appointed Zhao Yun as "General of the Flying Army" after occupying Chengdu. At that time, many suggested to Liu Bei to grant estates and plantations around Chengdu to his generals for them to settle in. Zhao Yun argued that it was more suitable to return the lands to the locals, and Liu Bei accepted his advice.

====Battle of Han River====
{{Main|Battle of Han River}}
In 219, Liu Bei and Cao Cao battled for control over [[Hanzhong]] in the [[Hanzhong Campaign]]. Cao Cao had huge amounts of food supplies stocked up near the north mountain. Zhao Yun sent his soldiers to follow [[Huang Zhong]] to attack Cao Cao's army and seize the supplies. When Huang Zhong did not return on time, Zhao Yun brought a dozen men with him to find Huang. They ran into Cao Cao's vanguard army and were preparing for engagement when Cao's main force arrived. The situation became perilous for Zhao Yun as he was vastly outnumbered. Zhao Yun attacked the frontline of Cao Cao's army, surprising the enemy and causing them to momentarily disperse. However, Cao Cao's troops soon regrouped and surrounded Zhao Yun, so Zhao fought his way towards his own camp. When Zhao Yun saw that his subordinate Zhang Zhu was injured and had fallen behind, he turned back to rescue him. Cao Cao's army pursued Zhao Yun back to his camp. [[Zhang Yi (Bogong)|Zhang Yi]], Administrator of Mianyang, who was stationed in Zhao Yun's camp, thought it would be best to close all the gates. However, upon entering the camp, Zhao Yun ordered all flags and banners to be hidden, all drumming to be stopped, and the gates left completely open. Cao Cao's force feared an ambush in the camp and hastily retreated. Just then, Zhao Yun ordered his drummers to beat the drums loudly and his archers to fire arrows at the enemy. Cao Cao's army was taken by surprise and disintegrated into chaos. Many of Cao Cao's soldiers drowned as they tried to flee towards the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]] to escape.

The following day after the battle, Liu Bei arrived to inspect the battle situation. He praised Zhao Yun for the victory, "Zilong has valor through and through", and threw a feast in honor of Zhao. From then on, Zhao Yun became known as "General of Tiger's Might" (<U+864E><U+5A01><U+5C07><U+8ECD>) in Liu Bei's army.

In 221, Liu Bei proclaimed himself [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of [[Shu Han]], and declared war on [[Eastern Wu]] to avenge the death of [[Guan Yu]] and the loss of Jing Province. Zhao Yun attempted to dissuade Liu Bei from waging war on Wu, and advised him to attack [[Cao Wei|Wei]] first, but Liu Bei ignored his advice. Liu Bei then left Zhao Yun in charge of Jiangzhou, while he personally led an army to attack Wu, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Xiaoting]].

===Later life===
Liu Bei died in 223 and was succeeded by his son, Liu Shan. In the same year, Zhao Yun was named "South Conquering General" (<U+5F81><U+5357><U+5C07><U+8ECD>) and "Central-Protector-of-Army" (<U+4E2D><U+8B77><U+8ECD>), and received the title of "Marquis of Yongchang" (<U+6C38><U+660C><U+4EAD><U+4FAF>). He was promoted to "East Guarding General" (<U+93AE><U+6771><U+5C07><U+8ECD>) subsequently. In 227, Zhao Yun followed [[Zhuge Liang]] to [[Hanzhong]] to prepare for the first [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|Northern Expedition]].

====Zhao Yun's last battle====
During the first expedition, as opposed to what was mentioned in the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', the honor of being the vanguard did not go to Zhao Yun. Instead, Zhao Yun was sent as a decoy against the main Wei force in Ji Valley, led by [[Cao Zhen]]. With Cao Zhen's men mostly tied up by Zhao Yun, Zhuge Liang's army marched without much opposition at first. Upon learning that the Wei emperor [[Cao Rui]] dispatched [[Zhang He]] as reinforcement, Zhuge Liang promoted [[Ma Su]] over more experienced generals such as [[Wei Yan]] and [[Wu Yi (Three Kingdoms)|Wu Yi]] (<U+5433><U+61FF>) to the commander of the vanguard in order to fend off Zhang He at [[Battle of Jieting|Jieting]]. Ma Su was defeated by Zhang He and the Shu forces were forced to retreat. Later, Zhuge Liang lamented on his loss in the first Northern Expedition, he pointed out "his huge army at Mount Qi and Zhao Yun's army in Ji Valley, were larger than that of the enemies."<ref>(<U+6F22><U+6649><U+6625><U+79CB><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+6216><U+52F8><U+4EAE><U+66F4><U+767C><U+5175><U+8005><U+FF0C><U+4EAE><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+5927><U+8ECD><U+5728><U+7941><U+5C71><U+3001><U+7B95><U+8C37><U+FF0C><U+7686><U+591A><U+65BC><U+8CCA><U+FF0C><U+800C><U+4E0D><U+80FD><U+7834><U+8CCA><U+70BA><U+8CCA><U+6240><U+7834><U+8005><U+FF0C><U+5247><U+6B64><U+75C5><U+4E0D><U+5728><U+5175><U+5C11><U+4E5F><U+FF0C><U+5728><U+4E00><U+4EBA><U+8033><U+3002><U+4ECA><U+6B32><U+6E1B><U+5175><U+7701><U+5C07><U+FF0C><U+660E><U+7F70><U+601D><U+904E><U+FF0C><U+6821><U+8B8A><U+901A><U+4E4B><U+9053><U+65BC><U+5C07><U+4F86><U+FF1B><U+82E5><U+4E0D><U+80FD><U+7136><U+8005><U+FF0C><U+96D6><U+5175><U+591A><U+4F55><U+76CA><U+FF01><U+81EA><U+4ECA><U+5DF2><U+5F8C><U+FF0C><U+8AF8><U+6709><U+5FE0><U+616E><U+65BC><U+570B><U+FF0C><U+4F46><U+52E4><U+653B><U+543E><U+4E4B><U+95D5><U+FF0C><U+5247><U+4E8B><U+53EF><U+5B9A><U+FF0C><U+8CCA><U+53EF><U+6B7B><U+FF0C><U+529F><U+53EF><U+8E7B><U+8DB3><U+800C><U+5F85><U+77E3><U+3002><U+300D>, ''Spring and Autumn Annal of Han and Jin Dynasty'' by [[Xi Zaochi]]).</ref> However, his defeat by a smaller force was largely a result of Zhuge Liang's allocation of resources. A log in ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' explains why Zhao Yun was defeated<U+2014>the entry says " (Zhao) Yun and [[Deng Zhi|(Deng) Zhi]]'s troops were weak, while the enemy was strong, so they lost at Ji Valley (<U+96F2><U+3001><U+829D><U+5175><U+5F31><U+6575><U+5F37><U+FF0C><U+5931><U+5229><U+65BC><U+7B95><U+8C37>)." From the record, Zhuge Liang had reserved the elite troops for his favorite, Ma Su, and himself; Zhao Yun was given only weaker soldiers.<ref>(<U+4EAE><U+4EE4><U+96F2><U+8207><U+9127><U+829D><U+5F80><U+62D2><U+FF0C><U+800C><U+8EAB><U+653B><U+7941><U+5C71><U+3002>) Chen Shou. ''Records of Three Kingdoms''.</ref> In the aforementioned dialogue of Zhuge Liang, Zhuge presumed that numbers alone would help him prevail over his rival, without considering giving more power to veteran generals like Zhao Yun, Wei Yan and others; it was only after his failure did Zhuge realize army size alone did not determine the outcome of a battle(<U+4ECA><U+6B32><U+6E1B><U+5175><U+7701><U+5C07><U+FF0C><U+660E><U+7F70><U+601D><U+904E><U+FF0C><U+6821><U+8B8A><U+901A><U+4E4B><U+9053><U+65BC><U+5C07><U+4F86><U+FF1B><U+82E5><U+4E0D><U+80FD><U+7136><U+8005><U+FF0C><U+96D6><U+5175><U+591A><U+4F55><U+76CA><U+FF01>).

Unable to muster a victory, Zhao Yun managed to minimize his losses by rallying his surviving men to firmly defend their positions, he then personally went to the rear to prevent enemy pursuit, and did not hurry his retreat, so supplies were not lost, and no one was left behind. When he safely returned to Hanzhong, Zhuge Liang was surprised by Zhao Yun's smooth retreat and told Zhao to distribute the excess silk fabrics to his soldiers as a consolation. However, Zhao Yun rebuked his supervisor, and said to the latter, "How can rewards be given when our campaign failed? Please store the silk in a warehouse, and distribute them in October."<ref>(<U+96F2><U+6709><U+8ECD><U+8CC7><U+9918><U+7D79><U+FF0C><U+4EAE><U+4F7F><U+5206><U+8CDC><U+5C07><U+58EB><U+FF0C><U+96F2><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+8ECD><U+4E8B><U+7121><U+5229><U+FF0C><U+4F55><U+70BA><U+6709><U+8CDC><U+FF1F><U+5176><U+7269><U+8ACB><U+6089><U+5165><U+8D64><U+5CB8><U+5E9C><U+5EAB><U+FF0C><U+9808><U+5341><U+6708><U+70BA><U+51AC><U+8CDC><U+3002><U+300D><U+4EAE><U+5927><U+5584><U+4E4B><U+3002>) ''Legends of Zhao Yun'' (<U+96F2><U+5225><U+50B3>).</ref> Zhuge Liang was delighted when he heard what Zhao Yun said. Zhao Yun was demoted to "General of Peace Maintenance" (<U+93AE><U+8ECD><U+5C07><U+8ECD>) as an overall campaign failure, despite his role as a decoy.

===Death===
Zhao Yun died in 229 in Hanzhong and was granted the posthumous title of "Marquis of Shunping" (<U+9806><U+5E73><U+4FAF>) by Liu Shan in 261.<ref>(<U+6CBB><U+800C><U+7121><U+771A><U+66F0><U+5E73><U+3002><U+57F7><U+4E8B><U+6709><U+5236><U+66F0><U+5E73><U+3002><U+5E03><U+7DB1><U+6301><U+7D00><U+66F0><U+5E73>...<U+6148><U+548C><U+904D><U+670D><U+66F0><U+9806><U+3002>) One can be given a posthumous name of "Ping" based on several criteria: Administering without fault, complying with regulations when handling matters, or enforcing the rules and orders. In addition, it was specifically mentioned by [[Jiang Wei]] that "<U+514B><U+5B9A><U+798D><U+4E82>" (ability to overcome disasters)" was one main reason to bestow the name of "<U+5E73> (ping) upon Zhao Yun. To be qualified for the posthumous title of "Shun," someone has to be kind, benevolent and respected by others. See ''Lost Book of Zhou. Rules on assigning a posthumous name''.</ref> Liu Shan's order for Zhao Yun to be honoured read, "When Zhao Yun was serving the late emperor (Liu Bei), his contributions were already remarkable. When I was young, I relied on his loyalty to save me from great danger. That is why I am bestowing upon him the honour." Zhao Yun was one of 12 Shu subjects to be granted posthumous titles of nobility.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Zhao Yun had two sons, [[Zhao Tong (Three Kingdoms)|Zhao Tong]] (<U+8D99><U+7D71>) and Zhao Guang. The latter followed [[Jiang Wei]] on the [[Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions|campaigns]] against Wei, and was killed in action in Tazhong.

==Appraisal==
Zhao Yun was a disciplinarian who was able to differentiate between personal friendship and official relation. In 202, he participated in the [[Battle of Bowang]] against Cao Cao's general [[Xiahou Dun]]. In that battle, he captured [[Xiahou Lan]] (<U+590F><U+4FAF><U+862D>), an old acquaintance who was from the same hometown as him. Zhao Yun turned Xiahou Lan in to Liu Bei, despite their close tie, but pleaded for Xiahou's life, to which Liu agreed. Xiahou Lan, as a person who was proficient at laws, became a military judge under Zhao Yun's recommendation; however, Zhao never kept Xiahou close. Such was his carefulness in handling relationships.

Zhao Yun was also able to remain sensible when facing temptation. When Zhao Yun and Zhao Fan got acquainted, the latter proposed a marriage between the former and Lady Fan, the widowed wife of Zhao Fan's older brother, while Zhao Yun politely declined, saying to Zhao Fan, "I share the same surname with you, therefore I regard your older brother as mine." Zhao Yun explained later why he did not agree to the marriage, "Zhao Fan was forced to succumb, his intentions are not yet clear. Besides, there are many other women in this world."<ref>(<U+96F2><U+8FAD><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+76F8><U+8207><U+540C><U+59D3><U+FF0C><U+537F><U+5144><U+7336><U+6211><U+5144><U+3002><U+300D><U+56FA><U+8FAD><U+4E0D><U+8A31><U+3002><U+6642><U+6709><U+4EBA><U+52F8><U+96F2><U+7D0D><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+96F2><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+7BC4><U+8FEB><U+964D><U+8033><U+FF0C><U+5FC3><U+672A><U+53EF><U+6E2C><U+FF1B><U+5929><U+4E0B><U+5973><U+4E0D><U+5C11><U+3002><U+300D><U+9042><U+4E0D><U+53D6><U+3002><U+7BC4><U+679C><U+9003><U+8D70><U+FF0C><U+96F2><U+7121><U+7E96><U+4ECB><U+3002>).</ref> Zhao Fan indeed escaped, indicating he harbored ill intentions. On the other hand, Zhao Yun remained unharmed because of his rationalism.

==In fiction==
{{see also|List of fictitious stories in Romance of the Three Kingdoms}}
Many of Zhao Yun's actual exploits were highly dramatized in [[Luo Guanzhong]]'s historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''. In the novel, Zhao Yun is described as being almost perfect, possessing unparalleled physical power as well as unwavering loyalty to his lord, tremendous courage, keen intelligence and serene charisma. These traits have often been reflected in almost all modern material about Zhao Yun to date. The novel portrays him as a courageous, loyal, and heroic warrior, and depicting him surviving insurmountable odds many times single-handedly.

===Rescuing Liu Shan in Changban===
[[File:Zhao Yun TV Serial.jpg|thumb|220px|Zhao Yun (played by Zhang Shan) fleeing with the infant Liu Shan as depicted in the TV series ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms (TV series)|Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'']]
The novel portrayed Zhao Yun quickly and single-handedly slaying numerous enemy generals as he rode from point to point during the [[Battle of Changban]], while asking civilians the whereabouts of [[Lady Gan]], [[Lady Mi]], and Liu Shan. As proof of his resolve, he stated that he would search everywhere to find them and if he could not, he would die on the battlefield. One of the many generals that fell to Zhao Yun was [[Xiahou En]], who carried one of Cao Cao's prized swords, the "Qinggang" (<U+9752><U+91ED>). The sword was said to be able to cut through metal as if it were mud, and Zhao Yun took it with him after slaying Xiahou En. Upon finally finding Lady Mi and Liu Shan near an old well, Lady Mi, who was injured in the leg, gave the child to Zhao Yun and refused to go with him, saying that she would be a burden to them. With enemy soldiers approaching, the two argued until Lady Mi committed suicide by throwing herself into a nearby well. Zhao Yun strapped the child to his chest and covered him with his breast plate armour and fought his way out through overwhelming encirclement of enemy troops, armed with only a spear and the newly acquired Qinggang sword. Zhao Yun's valor impressed Cao Cao, who ordered his archers not to fire at Zhao, but capture him alive instead in hope that Zhao would surrender to him. Throughout the battle, Zhao Yun charged in and out of the enemy formation seven times, killing over 50 enemy commanders.

Zhao Yun eventually fought his way to Changban Bridge, where he met [[Zhang Fei]], who stayed behind to block the incoming enemy troops. Zhao Yun finally returned to Liu Bei's side, returned Liu Shan to him and expressed remorse for his failure to bring back Lady Mi. Liu Bei threw the infant to the ground, saying that his son was not worth the risk taken by the general to save him. Zhao Yun barely caught the child in his arms.

===Rescuing Liu Shan from Lady Sun===
In chapter 61 (a fictionalization of a real incident), [[Lady Sun]] returned to Jiangdong to visit her ill mother after receiving news from her older brother, [[Sun Quan]]. In fact, Sun Quan was lying, as he wanted to trick Lady Sun into bringing Liu Shan along, and hold the boy hostage in exchange for Jing Province from Liu Bei. When Zhao Yun heard that Lady Sun was leaving with Liu Shan, he rushed to the pier and saw that Lady Sun had just boarded the vessel bound for Jiangdong, manned by [[Zhou Shan]].

Zhao Yun boarded a small fishing boat and caught up with the vessel and leapt onto it. Zhao Yun fought his way through and managed to seize back Liu Shan from Lady Sun, but was unable to get off safely. Just then, the vessel was intercepted by a fleet led by [[Zhang Fei]]. Zhou Shan attempted to stop them but was slain by Zhang Fei. Lady Sun eventually agreed to let Liu Shan leave with Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun while she returned home alone.

==Modern references==
Zhao Yun has been featured prominently in Chinese popular culture, literature, art and anecdotes. Zhao Yun was already a relatively well-known hero from the Three Kingdoms period, as folk tales about his heroics have been passed down through centuries. He became a famous household name due to the popularity of the novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''. Recently, Zhao Yun's popularity has moved beyond Asia and into the Western world, through various media, including the Internet and video games.

===Film and television===
A dramatised version of Zhao Yun's life story is featured in the 2008 film ''[[Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon]]'', starring [[Andy Lau]] as "Zhao Zilong" (a reference to Zhao Yun by his style name). [[Hu Jun]] played Zhao Yun in ''[[Red Cliff (film)|Red Cliff]]'', another film based on the Three Kingdoms that was released later in the same year. In the 2010 television series ''[[Three Kingdoms (TV series)|Three Kingdoms]]'', directed by [[Gao Xixi]], Zhao Yun was portrayed by [[Nie Yuan]].
