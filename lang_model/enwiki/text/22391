Named after ''[[The Pink Panther]]'' series of crime comedy films, '''Pink Panthers''' is the name given by [[Interpol]] to an international jewel thief network, composed mainly of ethnic [[Serbs]], which is responsible for some of the most audacious thefts in criminal history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleishman |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-balkan-panthers29-2009jul29,0,315138.story |title=Balkans' Pink Panther jewel thieves smash their way into myth |publisher=latimes.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}</ref> They are responsible for what have been termed some of the most glamorous heists ever, and one criminologist even described their crimes as "artistry".<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/> They have targeted several countries and continents, and include Japan's most successful robbery ever amongst their thefts. A film documentary based upon their thefts, ''[[Smash & Grab]]'', was released in 2013.

Some law enforcement agencies suspect that the group is responsible for over [[United States dollar|US$]] 500 million in bold robberies in [[Dubai]], [[Switzerland]], [[Japan]], [[France]], [[Liechenstein|Liechtenstein]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Spain]] and [[Monaco]]. Law enforcement suspect their involvement in the robbery of the jewellery store [[Harry Winston Diamond Corporation|Harry Winston]] in [[Paris]], on December 9, 2008. The thieves escaped with more than [[Euro|<U+20AC>]] 80&nbsp;million worth of jewellery.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/world/europe/12iht-jewels.4.18643464.html "Pink Panthers' Global Trail Littered with Jewels"], New York Times, Dec. 12, 2008</ref>

==Raids==
Interpol has said it estimates that there are several hundred thieves in the group, and that many come from [[Serbia]].  However, other sources say the gang is suspected of having at least sixty members, around thirty of whom are thought to be from [[Montenegro]].<ref name="Pink Panther arrests in Monaco"/> Several gang members are former soldiers with violent pasts.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/> They are fluent in many different languages and possess passports which have been given to others.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/>

In 1993, the gang first came to attention and earned the nickname "Pink Panthers" following the theft of a <U+00A3> 500,000 diamond from a jewellers in the [[Mayfair]] area of [[central London]] in the United Kingdom.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/> The thieves hid the diamond in a jar containing face cream, mimicking an act seen in the film ''[[The Return of the Pink Panther]]''.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/> In May 2005, Graff, a diamond specialist in London, was targeted by Pink Panthers and lost a total of <U+00A3>1 million in jewellery.<ref name="Jewellers hit again in '<U+00A3>1m raid'"/> Three men were suspected of being behind the theft; one was in possession of a firearm.<ref name="Jewellers hit again in '<U+00A3>1m raid'"/> Graff had been targeted in 2002 and lost <U+00A3>23 million on that occasion, <U+00A3> 3 million of which was recovered two years later.<ref name="Jewellers hit again in '<U+00A3>1m raid'">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4588823.stm|title=Jewellers hit again in '<U+00A3>1m raid'|date=2005-05-28|accessdate=2009-06-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="Gems robber jailed for 15 years"/> One of the thieves was sentenced to fifteen years in prison in July 2004.<ref name="Gems robber jailed for 15 years">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3913345.stm|title=Gems robber jailed for 15 years|date=2004-07-21|accessdate=2009-06-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref>

In the space of six years during the twenty-first century, the Pink Panthers robbed 120 stores in twenty different countries.<ref name="'Jewel gangster' held in Monaco"/> [[Japan]], London, Denmark, Monaco, Paris, [[Switzerland]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and the [[United States]] have all been targeted by the gang.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/><ref name="'Jewel gangster' held in Monaco"/> Their attention to detail has ensured this high rate of success. Before robbing a jewellery store in [[Biarritz]], the gang covered a nearby bench in fresh paint to deter anyone from sitting on it and seeing them in action.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/>

The gang is suspected of participating in at least two smash-and-grab jewellery robberies in Tokyo's [[Ginza]] district.  The first, in 2004, netted <U+00A5> 3.5 million in gems. The second, in June 2007, took jewellery valued at <U+00A5> 284 million.  In that heist, Rifat Hadziahmetovic and Radovan Jelusic sprayed tear gas at three saleswomen then took a tiara, necklaces, and other jewels and fled the store (see below for details of their subsequent arrest).<ref name="japantimes1">[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120521a5.html 'Pink Panther' to face trial in Montenegro over 2007 Ginza heist]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 May 2012, p. 1</ref>

The gang is also known for its daring escapes and attempts to break into their chosen store. They robbed a jewellery store in [[Saint-Tropez]] in 2005 wearing T-shirts emblazoned with flowery designs then made their escape on a speed boat.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/> Prior to one 2008 robbery of Graff jewellers in [[Dubai]], eight gang members drove a pair of [[limousine]]s through a window, taking watches and other items worth a total of <U+00A3> 8 million.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/> In a further robbery, four gang members dressed themselves up as women in December 2008 before breaking into France's Harry Winston jewellers in Paris.<ref name="'Jewel gangster' held in Monaco"/> The gang escaped from the store with items worth over US$ 100 million (<U+00A3> 60 million).<ref name="'Jewel gangster' held in Monaco"/> There is growing speculation that the US$ 65 million heist on 6 August 2009 of an exclusive London jewellery store was the work of the same group. A key element in the speculation is that the men who looted Graff Diamonds on New Bond Street made no effort to hide their faces, suggesting that they had been able to alter their looks with "[[Mission Impossible]]" style prosthetic make-up.<ref>{{cite web|last=Treptow |first=Cornelia |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/International/story?id=8327555&page=1 |title=Graff Jewel Heist, Were Pink Panthers Theives Behind Record-Breaking Gem Robbery? - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}</ref>

In 2013, the gang was suspected to have struck again when a man wearing a ball cap and a scarf covering his face broke into the [[Carlton Cannes|Carlton Hotel]] in [[Cannes]] and made off with US$ 136 million worth of diamonds, gems, and jewelry being stored by the Leviev diamond house for an exhibit (see [[Carlton Intercontinental Hotel heist]]). Nice-Matin speculated that this may have been the most costly jewelry theft in history.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-cannes-riviera-jewel-heist-20130729,0,1824610.story|title=$136 million French Riviera jewel heist may be biggest in history|first=Carol|last=Williams|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}</ref>

==Arrests and breakouts==
The thieves have been identified and linked through [[DNA]] matching according to Interpol leader [[Ronald Noble]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Tedesco |first=Louie |url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/521994-interpol-closing-in-on-pink-panther-jewel-thieves |title=Interpol closing in on 'Pink Panther' jewel thieves |publisher=Arabianbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-19}}</ref>

In 2005, two men and one woman gang member from Serbia were arrested in [[Belgrade]].<ref name="Serbs guilty of Japan jewel heist"/> In October 2007, they were sentenced to jail terms by a court in Serbia for the theft of the [[Comtesse de Vendome|Comtesse de Vendome necklace]], worth approximately <U+00A3> 15 million (US$ 30 million), from a Tokyo jewellery boutique, in what was Japan's biggest ever jewel robbery in March 2004.<ref name="Serbs guilty of Japan jewel heist">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7024879.stm|title=Serbs guilty of Japan jewel heist|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2009-06-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The gang leader was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment whilst the other two were handed lesser sentences.<ref name="Serbs guilty of Japan jewel heist"/>

Three Pink Panthers from Serbia were declared guilty of robberies carried out in Biarritz, [[Cannes]], [[Courchevel]] and Saint-Tropez by one court in [[Chamb<U+00E9>ry]] in 2008.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/> Two were given jail-terms of six and ten years.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/>

One suspect in a June 2007 [[Ginza]] heist, a [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]]-national named Rifat Hadziahmetovic, travelling on a forged [[Bulgaria]]n passport, was arrested in March 2009 by [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] police at [[Larnaca International Airport]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Deborah | last=Seward | coauthors= |authorlink= | title='Pink Panther' suspect held in Cyprus | date=28 March 2009 | publisher= | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pink-panther-suspect-held-in-cyprus-1656054.html | work =[[The Independent]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-03-28 | language = | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Inspector Clouseau gets his man | date=March 28, 2009 | publisher=Reuters | url =http://www.nypost.com/seven/03282009/news/worldnews/inspector_clouseau_gets_his_man_161682.htm | work =[[New York Post]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-03-28 | language = }}</ref> He is due to serve a sentence in Cyprus for travelling on a forged passport before being extradited to Spain.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title='Pink Panther' suspect to serve Cyprus jail term | date=21 April 2009 | agency=Associated Press | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pink-panther-suspect-to-serve-cyprus-jail-term-1671815.html | work =[[The Independent]] | pages = | accessdate = 2009-04-21 | language = | location=London}}</ref> He was extradited from Spain to Japan and, in September 2011, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | authorlink= | title='Pink Panther' fugitive in Tokyo jail for Ginza heist | date=Aug 15, 2010 | publisher=Japan Times | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100815a3.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+japantimes+%28The+Japan+Times%3A+All+Stories%29 | work=[[Japan Times]] | pages= | accessdate=2010-08-14 | language= }}</ref>  His accomplice, Radovan Jelusic, was arrested in Italy in 2010 over a separate crime, then was extradited to Montenegro to stand trial on 18 May 2012.<ref name="japantimes1"/>

On 20 June 2009, French police in [[Monte Carlo]] detained another three members of the gang seen loitering near jewellery shops in [[Monaco]].<ref name="'Jewel gangster' held in Monaco">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8110963.stm|title='Jewel gangster' held in Monaco|date=2009-06-20|accessdate=2009-06-20|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The gang members drove up outside a casino in Casino Square on 18 June 2009.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/>  The men were told to lie down<!--is this phrase really important to the article?--> and were then handcuffed before being whisked away from the scene quickly.<ref name="Three suspected Pink Panther gang members arrested in Monaco"/>

A head figure of Pink Panthers, Mitar Marjanovic, was arrested on 8 March 2012 in Rome, after two of his accomplices in a bank robbery, committed a month earlier, dropped stolen items containing Marjanovic's fingerprints.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.focus-fen.net/?id=n272772 | title=Serbian Pink Panthers gang<U+2019>s <U+2018>brain' arrested | publisher=Focus News Agency | date=March 8, 2012 | accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=el&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.novosti.rs%2Fvesti%2Fnaslovna%2Faktuelno.291.html%3A369668-Rim-Uhapsen-Mitar-Marjanovic---jedan-od-vodja-quotPink-panteraquot | title=Rome: arrested Mitar Marjanovi<U+0107> - one of the leaders of the "Pink Panther" (google translate version) | publisher=Novosti online | date=March 8, 2012 | accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>

On 14 March 2012, three more members of the gang were arrested in Athens, Greece. Two of the three were male Serbians, aged 20 and 36, and were arrested while reconnoitering a jewellery store robbery. Patrolling police were prompted to question them due to their wearing wigs. The two men fled and the 36-year-old fired and injured a police officer during the pursuit that followed. Both were arrested and led the police to the arrest of the third person, a 43-year-old Serbian female, Olivera Vasi<U+0107> <U+0106>irkovi<U+0107>.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=el&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.in.gr%2Fgreece%2Farticle%2F%3Faid%3D1231186387 | title=Two members of the international gang of bandits "Pink Panthers" were arrested in Athens (google translate version) | publisher=in.gr | date=March 14, 2012 | accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref> On 12 July 2012 Olivera escaped from Athens' prison by knocking out a guard and stealing her keys.

On 14 May 2013, a member of the gang escaped from the "Bois-Mermet" prison in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland. He hasn't yet been caught. He escaped with the help of 3 outside accomplices who meticulously prepared the operation. Four other prisoners got away at the same time.

On 25 July 2013, [[Milan Poparic]], who was serving a sentence of almost seven years for a 2009 robbery at a jewelery store, was the third <U+201C>Pink Panther<U+201D> to escape from a Swiss prison since May 2013. Also escaping was Swiss [[wikt:kidnapper|kidnapper]], [[arsonist]] and [[money laundering|money launderer]] Adrian Albrecht. They were helped out of the prison at [[Orbe]], in western Switzerland, by accomplices who broke through the perimeter fence and brought ladders for the escapees while keeping the prison guards at bay with fire from [[AK-47]]'s.<ref>{{cite web|title="Pink Panther" jewel thief escapes Swiss prison|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57595705/pink-panther-jewel-thief-escapes-swiss-prison/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref>
