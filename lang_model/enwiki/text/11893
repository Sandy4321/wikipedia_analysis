'''''Earth''''' ({{Language|ru}}/{{lang-ua|'''''<U+0417><U+0435><U+043C><U+043B><U+044F>'''''}}, {{translit|'''''Zemlya'''''}}) is a 1930 Soviet film by Ukrainian director [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], concerning the process of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] and the hostility of [[Kulak]] landowners. It is Part 3 of Dovzhenko's "Ukraine Trilogy" (along with ''[[Zvenigora]]'' and ''[[Arsenal (film)|Arsenal]]'').

==Plot==
The film begins with the final moments of grandfather Semyon (Simon) Opanas beneath a pear tree.<ref name="dovzhenko">[http://rayuzwyshyn.net/dovzhenko/Earth.htm Philosophy, Iconology, Collectivization: Earth (1930)]</ref> Next local kulaks, including Arkhyp Bilokin, contemplate the process of collectivization and declare their resistance to it, while elsewhere Semyon's grandson Vasyl (Basil) and his [[komsomol]] friends also meet to discuss collectivization, although his father is skeptical. 

Later, Vasyl arrives with the community's first [[tractor]] to much excitement. After the men urinate in the overheated [[radiator]], the peasants plow the land with the tractor and harvest the grain. A montage sequence presents the production of bread from beginning to end. That night Vasyl dances a [[hopak]] along a path on his way home, but a dark figure attacks and kills him.

Vasyl's father turns away the priest who expects to lead the [[funeral]], declaring his [[atheism]]. He asks Vasyl's friends to bury his son in a new way without priests and "sing new songs for a new life." The villagers do so, while Vasyl's fiancee, Natalya, mourns him painfully and the local priest curses them as impious. At the cemetery, Bilokin's son Khoma (Thomas) arrives in a frenzy to declare that he will resist collectivization and that he was the one who killed Vasyl, but the villagers pay him no attention. One declares that Vasyl's glory will fly around the world like a new communist airplane. The film ends with a downpour of rain over fruit and vegetables.<ref name="dovzhenko"/>

==Production==
===Background===
The political and historic events of ''Earth'' and the agricultural developments of Dovzhenko's home country the Ukraine was a hot topic during the film's production and laid the foundation of the controversy that the film's releasde caused. In 1906 the Tzar had allowed peasants to own private land, which they then passed down through the generations. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, these peasants in the Ukraine wanted to keep their family land and farms and the Soviet government tolerated them. After the grain shortages in the late 1920s, Joseph Stalin decided that it was necessary to eliminate "rural capatilism" in these regions and take control of the farming industry in 1929. Stalin stated "We must smash the Kulaks, eliminate them as a class."<ref>Kepley, Vance. ''In the Service of the State: The Cinema of Alexander Dovzhenko.'' London: The University of Wisconsin Press. 1986. ISBN 0-299-10680-2. pp. 77.</ref> Some of the land owning peasants fought back and began to sabotage agricultural machines. The local Kulaks were more militant and commited violent acts against Soviet officials. Most Ukrainians wanted to keep their private land, especially since compared to many other parts of Russia their land was agriculturally rich and fertile. In the middle of the political conflict surrounding this topic, Dovzhenko made a lyrical and poetic film depicting the lives of Ukrainian farmers that many Soviet officials comsidered completely inappropriate.<ref>Kepley. pp. 78.</ref>

===Writing and production===
Dovzhenko wrote the original scenerio for ''Earth'' in 1929 in response to the newfound collectivisation of small villages in the Ukraine, which he described as "a period not only of economic transformation but also of mental transformation of the whole people."<ref>Dovzhenko, Alexander. ''Earth''. New York: Simon and schulster. 1973. SBN 671-21393-8. pp. 58.</ref> He based the character of Semyon on his own grandfather<ref>Kepley. pp. 4.</ref> and the murder of Vasyl on the assassination of a Soviet agent by Kulaks in his own home district.<ref>Kepley. pp. 76.</ref> 

This was Dovzhenko's first film with Kiev Studios after having impressed both critics and the Soviet government with his first two films. He once again used cinematographer and collaborator [[Danylo Demutsky]] on this film.<ref>Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors, Volume 1''. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 262.</ref> Dovzhenko later adapted the film into a novelization and published the completed scenerio in 1952.<ref>Dovzhenko. pp. 58.</ref> In Ukrainian and Russian, the title "Zemlia" translates to "earth" in the sense of soil, land or ground.<ref>Kepley. pp. 79.</ref>

== Reception ==
''Earth'' was simultaneously lauded and derided by Soviet authorities due to its fairly ambiguous political message on such a controversial political subject. It first premiered in [[Kharkov]], Ukraine in the spring of 1930 during an event held to honor the local Dovzhenko. The film was an immense success and recieved a standing ovation.<ref>Kepley. pp. 75.</ref> This was the only occasion during its initial release that ''Earth'' was praised and afterwards it was criticized by Soviet journalists. One critic called it "idealogically vicious" and some Communist Party officials accused Dovzhenko of wasting public funds on the film. ''[[Pravda]]'' praised the films visualstyle but claimed it had a false political message. The official spokesman for the Red Army officially endorsed the film.<ref>Kepley. pp. 75.</ref> Soviet communist artist [[Demyan Bedny]] called the film "counterrevolutionary" and "defeatist".<ref>Wakeman. pp. 263.</ref> Bedny was known as "The Kremlin Poet and was also a personal friend of [[Joseph Stalin]]. He publicy criticized the film in the form of a satirical poem that appeared in ''Izvestia'' in which he stated that the film naively took a philosophical attitude towards political reality.<ref>Kepley. pp. 75.</ref> The film was severely cut by the Soviet government. Dovzhenko was so upset by the negative reaction to the film that, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he left the Ukraine and traveled throughout Europe screening his films<ref>Wakeman. pp. 263.</ref> and experimenting with newly develpoed sound equipment available in western Europe.<ref>Kepley. pp. 85.</ref>

This is usually considered Dovzhenko's best film, and is often cited alongside [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) as one of the most important films of the Soviet era. 

Film critic [[C. A. Lejeune]] praised the film's main section, saying that it "contains perhaps more understanding of pure beauty in cinema, more validity of relation in moving image, than any ten minutes of production yet known to the screen."<ref>Wakeman. pp. 262.</ref> Dovzhenko's biographer Marco Carynnyk called the film "passionate simplicity...which has made it a masterpiece of world cinema" and praised its "powerful lyric affirmation of life."<ref>Wakeman. pp. 626.</ref> [[Lewis Jacobs]] compared Dovzhenko's work to Eisenstein and Pudovkin, stating that Dovzhenko "had added a deep personal and poetic insight...[his films] are laconic in style, with a strange, wonderfully imaginative quality difficult to describe."<ref>Wakeman. pp. 263.</ref>

It was named #88 in the 1995 Centenary Poll of the 100 Best Films of the Century in [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] Magazine. The film was also voted one of the ten greatest films of all time by a group of 117 film historians at the 1958 [[Expo '58|Brussels World's Fair]] and named one of the top ten greatest films of all time by the International Film Critics Symposium.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lib.unc.edu/house/mrc/films/full.php?film_id=5592|title = MRC FilmFinder-Full Record: Earth| accessdate = 2008-11-02}}</ref>

It's also the first film in a [[double-feature]] which [[Woody Allen]]'s character goes to see in the movie ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]''.
