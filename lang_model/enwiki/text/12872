'''''Mega Man 6''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Rockman 6 Shij<U+014D> Saidai no Tatakai!!'''''|<U+30ED><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30DE><U+30F3>6 <U+53F2><U+4E0A><U+6700><U+5927><U+306E><U+6226><U+3044>!!||lit. "Rockman 6: The Greatest Battle Ever!!"}}, is a [[video game]] developed by [[Capcom]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). It is the sixth installment in the [[Mega Man (original series)|original ''Mega Man'' series]] and was originally released in [[Japan]] on October 5, 1993 and in [[North America]] the following March. It was included in the ''[[Mega Man Anniversary Collection]]'' released in 2004.  As of 2011, it has never been released in the [[PAL region]].

The story of ''Mega Man 6'' opens during a competitive robot fighting tournament with entrants from all around the globe. A villainous figure known as "Mr. X" announces he has reprogrammed the eight powerful contestants with intent to use them for taking over the world. The game's robotic protagonist [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]], who was sent to oversee the tournament, springs into action to foil X's plot. A standard action-platformer, ''Mega Man 6'' plays nearly identically to its five predecessors with a few added features such as stages with alternate pathways and new [[List of Mega Man characters#Rush|Rush]] adaptors.

''Mega Man 6'' is the first game in the series to receive character design input from fans outside of Japan. This late-era game was also the last in the series released on Nintendo's 8-bit console. Due to the declining support of the NES and the growing presence of the newer and more powerful [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES), Capcom decided not to publish ''Mega Man 6'' in North America. The North American version of ''Mega Man 6'' was released by [[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]] instead. Critical reviews favored the game's comparable presentation and use of the established gameplay model from preceding chapters in the series, though nearly all judged it a redundant sequel.

==Plot==
''Mega Man 6'''s story takes place after the events of ''[[Mega Man 5]]''. The first annual "Robot Masters Tournament" is held in order to test the designing capabilities of the world's greatest robotics engineers.<ref name="manual">{{cite book |editor=Capcom |title=Mega Man 6 Instruction Booklet |year=1994 |month=March |publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America]] | pages=7<U+2013>14 | location=Redmond, WA | id=NES-G6-USA}}</ref>  The tournament is hosted by a man known only as "Mr. X" and many strong [[List of characters in the Mega Man series#Robot_Masters|Robot Masters]] participate.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Mega man 6 gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Using one of two adaptors, [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]] combines with [[List of Mega Man characters#Rush|Rush]] to propel through the air.]]
The gameplay in ''Mega Man 6'' is largely similar to its five NES counterparts.<ref name="NPfeature"/><ref name="GPreview">{{cite journal | journal=[[GamePro]] | issue=52 | author=Slasher Quan | date=November 1993 | title=ProReview: ''Mega Man 6'' | page=pp. 146<U+2013>7 | publisher=Infotainment World, Inc.}}</ref> The player takes control of Mega Man to complete a series of [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platform]] stages littered with smaller robot enemies and occasional larger [[Boss (video gaming)|mini-bosses]]. The player's primary method of attack is the "Mega Buster" cannon, which can be charged for more powerful shots. At the end of each of the initial eight stages is a boss battle, where the player inherits that Robot Master's unique "Master Weapon" if successful.<ref name="manual"/> These eight levels can be completed in any order, although all Robot Masters are weak to a specific Master Weapon, adding an element of strategy to the order chosen by the player.<ref name="NPfeature"/> The player's health is represented by a gauge that can be refilled by picking up energy pellets. Extra lives, reserve energy tanks, and pellets that refill Master Weapon power can also be found throughout each level. ''Mega Man 6'' introduces the "Energy Balancer", which automatically refills the weapon with the lowest energy when picking up Master Weapon power.<ref name="manual"/><ref name="gamesradar">{{cite web | author=Elston, Brett | date=June 30, 2008 | title=The ultimate ''Mega Man'' retrospective | url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/the-ultimate-mega-man-retrospective/a-2008062794557758069/p-4 | publisher=[[GamesRadar]] | accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref>

Previous ''Mega Man'' games typically allowed the player to call on the transformable dog [[List of Mega Man characters#Rush|Rush]] or use other support items in order to traverse difficult or otherwise unaccessible parts of a stage. ''Mega Man 6'' instead features a pair of "Rush Adaptors" that fuse Mega Man and Rush into special forms. The first, "Jet Mega Man", lets the player fly upward or hover for a brief period of time, but prevents the use of charge shots. The second, "Power Mega Man", utilizes a powerful, short-range punch attack for destroying large blocks.<ref name="manual"/><ref name="NPfeature"/> The player cannot slide when using either adapter. ''Mega Man 6'' also presents less linear ways to complete the stages than in previous entries in the series. There are two pathways in many of the stages that lead to boss rooms, but the player is often required to use one of the Rush adaptors to begin an alternate route. Although either one will clear the stage, only one of them will give the player a letter circuit board for assembling the helper bird [[List of Mega Man characters#Beat|Beat]].<ref name="NPfeature"/><ref name="screwattack">{{cite web | author=Skistimas , Craig | date=August 4, 2008 | title=Video Game Vault: ''Mega Man 6'' | url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/video-game-screwattack/37931 | publisher=[[Game Trailers]] | accessdate=2011-01-16}}</ref> Collecting all four parts will allow the player to call on Beat to attack enemies.<ref name="manual"/>

==Development==
''Mega Man 6'' was developed at the same time as the franchise's first spin-off, ''[[Mega Man X (video game)|Mega Man X]]'' for Nintendo's newer console, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]]. Series artist [[Keiji Inafune]] stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare, and one of the advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in the next.<ref name="r20"/> After having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries, Inafune thought that Rush adaptor assembly was inevitable. The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic. According to Inafune, "If you think about it, they shouldn't be able to combine like this. It would be awkward if parts of Rush like his neck were left over after they combined, so what was I supposed to do?"<ref name="r20"/>

The Robot Masters featured in some of the previous ''Mega Man'' games were the result of design contests held in Japan, in which fans of the series would submit their character ideas to Capcom. Keeping with the tradition, Japan held a design contest for ''Mega Man 6''. After the release of ''Mega Man 5'', the magazine ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' held a similar contest in North America.<ref name="r20"/><ref name="npfeature">{{cite journal | title=''Mega Man'' Robot Design Contest | date=January 1993 | issue=44 | pages=pp. 77<U+2013>9 | journal=Nintendo Power | publisher=Nintendo of America}}</ref> Only eight out of the more than 200,000 worldwide character submissions for ''Mega Man 6'' were accepted for the game.<ref name="r20"/> Six of the Robot Masters were designed by Japanese fans, while the remaining two (Knight Man and Wind Man) were designed by North American fans who entered the ''Nintendo Power'' contest.<ref name="NPfeature"/><ref name="gamesradar"/><ref name="screwattack"/><ref name="steps">{{cite web | author=Thomas, Lucas M. | date=February 16, 2010 | title=The 10 Steps to ''Mega Man 10'' | url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/106/1069184p4.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2010-04-11}}</ref> Inafune admitted that it was stressful when the last characters being designed for the game were not meeting with the development team's schedule.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=CFC Style Fan-Book | volume=3 | author=[[Keiji Inafune|Inafune, Keiji]] | date=1997 | title=''Rockman'' 10th Anniversary Celebration Plans | publisher=Capcom | language=Japanese | page=p. 24}}</ref> He concluded, "For having hit a lot of roadblocks, I feel like we got a lot done for ''6''.

''Mega Man 6'' is the last title in the franchise to be released on the 8-bit NES. A few months after the publication of ''Mega Man 5'', Capcom announced the sixth installment in the original series, as well as ''[[Mega Man Soccer]]'' and ''Mega Man X'' for the SNES.<ref>{{cite journal | title=''Super Mega Man'' <U+2015> So What's the Deal? | journal=Game Players | issue=26 | publisher=[[Future plc|Imagine Media]]| date=March 1993 | page=p. 20 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> Capcom chose not to publish the game outside Japan.

''Mega Man 6'' has enjoyed a favorable to mixed reception from gaming publications and websites. The graphics, play control, challenge level, and added power-ups were generally praised. ''[[GamePro]]'' was impressed with some of the newer enemies and larger mid-stage bosses, but was displeased with the game's recycling of Master Weapons seen in previous ''Mega Man'' games. Overall, the magazine described the graphics, audio, and level design in ''Mega Man 6'' as standard fare for the franchise and called the game a "rock of reliable NES fun" in a series that is as "predictable as the tide".<ref name="GPreview"/> [[Destructoid]] editor Tony Ponce considered ''Mega Man 6'' the best game in the entire series. He argued that the game "was [[Retrogaming|retro]] before retro was cool" due to Capcom's decision to develop it as a higher profile game on the NES during the era of [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation consoles]]. He also expressed appreciation for its music, introductions for each Robot Master, and the use of branching pathways in each level, among many other reasons.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ponce, Tony | date=December 25, 2009 | title=Why ''Mega Man 6'' is the best of the Mega Mans | url=http://www.destructoid.com/why-mega-man-6-is-the-best-of-the-mega-mans-158363.phtml | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | accessdate=2010-04-20}}</ref> ''Nintendo Power'' listed ''Mega Man 6'' as the best NES game of 1993, stating, "His sixth NES adventure, in which he uses two new, Special Power-Ups, might just be his best".<ref>{{cite journal | journal=Nintendo Power | issue=55 | date=January 1994 | page=p. 5 | title=Super Power Club: The Top Titles of 1993 | publisher=Nintendo of America}}</ref> Kaes Delgrego of [[Joystiq]] called ''Mega Man 6'' the fourth-best game in the franchise because of its implementation of the Rush adaptors, the Energy Balancer, multiple pathways, and the challenge present in the final levels.<ref>{{cite web | author=Delgrego, Kaes | date=September 22, 2008 | title=Top 5: ''Mega Man'' Games | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/22/4-mega-man-6/ | publisher=[[Joystiq]] | accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref> Craig Skistimas of [[ScrewAttack]] also appreciated these innovations and regretted missing out on the game when it was first released.<ref name="screwattack"/> <!--''Mega Man 6'' is listed by [[IGN]] as the 58th best game on the NES. The writers summarized, "''Mega Man 6'' is considered by many to be the last worthwhile NES release in the catalog, and though that's not saying much when looking at the title's contemporaries, ''Mega Man 6'' is still as good as it gets in many respects."<ref>{{cite web | author=[[Matt Casamassina|Casamassina, Matt]] |  title=58.

''Mega Man 6'' was nearly universally criticized for lacking originality, particularly with regard to its plot. [[GameSpot]] editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer labeled ''Mega Man 6'' the "cheesiest" among the NES titles: "If you're looking for mega-laughs, you might want to try this one out."<ref>{{cite web | author=Nutt, Christian and Speer, Justin | title=The History of ''Mega Man'' | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6076983/p-7.html | publisher=GameSpot | accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> [[1UP.com]] contributors likewise found that the game's "inane" storyline and villains both insult fans of the series and outweigh the game's good soundtrack and interesting power-ups.<ref name="manniversary"/><ref>{{cite web | author=Parish, Jeremy | date=May 10, 2007 | title=The ''Mega Man'' Series Roundup | url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&cId=3159344 | publisher=1UP.com | accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> The four members of the ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game's familiar 8-bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series. One reviewer commented, "OK, ''Mega Man'' was fun and original back in the days when the letter 'NES' meant something. Now the game is just getting redundant. Oh sure, Mega Man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon."<ref name="egmrev"/>
