'''Alveolar osteitis''' or, colloquially, a '''dry socket''', is a complication of wound healing following [[dental extraction|extraction of a tooth]].  The term ''alveolar'' refers to the ''alveolus'', which is the part of the jawbone that surrounds the teeth; ''osteitis'' means simply "bone inflammation". It is known as "dry socket" as after the clot is lost, the socket has a dry appearance because of exposed bone. The blood clot helps in stopping the bleeding and lays framework for new tissues to develop there but in case of dry socket, the clot is dislodged and the bone is exposed. This bare bone is exposed to bacteria in the saliva and the food which the patient consumes and the bone becomes infected and painful.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Alveolar osteitis usually occurs 3<U+2013>5 days after tooth extraction and causes severe throbbing and radiating pain which is difficult to localize.  Alveolar osteitis is characterized by [[detritus]], grayish [[Moulting|slough]], severe pain and foul odor.<ref name="AMLER"/><ref>[http://www.ladentalcenter.com/DrySocket.pdf What is Dry Socket? - How is it treated?], Louisiana Dental Center {{dead link|date=February 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.animated-teeth.com/dry-sockets/a1-dry-sockets.htm Dry socket symptoms and treatments], Animated-Teeth.com</ref>  The foul odor, in particular, is a result of the disintegration of the blood clot by [[putrefaction]] rather than by orderly resorption.
If a probe is gently passed in the tooth extraction socket, then bare bone is encountered which is very sensitive.

Multiple types of '''alveolar osteitis''' can result from disturbances in the healing process.  The type that is commonly referred to as "dry socket" is one in which the disturbance is from the time a blood clot forms immediately after tooth extraction to the initiation of healing in the 4<U+2013>5 day period after extraction occurs.  The healing tissue that is supposed to replace the blood clot, known as ''[[granulation tissue]]'', may fail to grow or be disrupted after beginning to grow, leading to the well known symptoms of alveolar osteitis.<ref name="AMLER">Amler, MH. <u>Disturbed healing of extraction wounds</u>. ''J Oral Implant'' 1999;25(3):179<U+2013>84</ref>

Wound healing is a complex process and can be positively and negatively affected by many factors.<ref>Colby, RC. <u>The general practitioner's perspective of the etiology, prevention and treatment of dry socket</u>. ''Gen Dent'' 1997;454:461<U+2013>67</ref>  Alveolar osteitis is the most common healing disturbance of extraction sockets.<ref name="AMLER"/>

'''Suppurative osteitis''' results when the disturbance of extraction socket wound healing occurs later, during the third stage of healing from day 14 to 16 after extraction, and is a manifestation of the disruption of [[connective tissue]] development.  This form usually results from an [[infection]] and exhibits a [[purulence|purulent discharge]] (pus) from the extraction socket.<ref name="AMLER"/>

Disruption of the extraction socket during an even later stage of healing might result in '''necrotizing osteitis''' in which encapsulated shards of bone ([[sequestrum|bony sequestrae]]) will be noted alongside inflammatory cells.<ref name="AMLER"/>

== Prevention ==
True alveolar osteitis, as opposed to simple postoperative pain, occurs in only about 1<U+2013>3% of extractions.<ref>Shafer, WG; Hine, MK; Levy, BM. ''A Textbook of Oral Pathology'' 3rd Ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders, 1984. pages 605<U+2013>8.</ref>  No one knows for certain how or why dry sockets develop following [[dental extraction]] but certain factors are associated with increased risk. One of these factors is the complexity of the extraction.  [[tobacco smoking|Smoking]] may be a contributing factor, possibly due to the decreased amount of oxygen available in the healing tissues. It is advisable to avoid smoking for at least 48 hours following tooth extraction to reduce the risk of developing dry socket.

Women are generally at higher risk than men of developing alveolar osteitis, because [[estrogen]] slows down healing.  Dentists recommend that their female patients have extractions performed during the last week of their menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels are lowest, to minimize chances of developing alveolar osteitis.<ref>Academy of General Dentistry.

== Treatment ==

The pain from alveolar osteitis usually lasts for 24<U+2013>72 hours.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} There is no real treatment for alveolar osteitis; it is a [[self-limiting]] condition that will improve and disappear with time, but certain interventions can significantly decrease pain during an episode of alveolar osteitis. These interventions usually consist of a gentle rinsing of the inflamed socket followed by the direct placement within the socket of some type of sedative dressing, which soothes the inflamed bone for a period of time and promotes tissue growth. This is usually done without anesthesia.<ref>[http://www.animated-teeth.com/dry-sockets/a4-dry-sockets-treatments.htm Dry socket symptoms and treatments], Animated-Teeth.com</ref>  The active ingredients in these sedative dressings usually include substances like, [[zinc oxide]], [[eugenol]], and [[oil of cloves]].  It is usually necessary to have this done for two or three consecutive days, although occasionally it can take longer. Because true alveolar osteitis pain is so intense, additional [[analgesics]] are sometimes prescribed.
