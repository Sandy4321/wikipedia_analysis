"'''Migrate'''" is a song by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]], included as a track on her eleventh [[studio album]], ''[[E=MC<U+00B2> (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC<U+00B2>]]'' (2008). Written by Carey, [[Danja (musician)|Nathaniel Hills]], [[T-Pain|Faheem Najim]], and [[The Clutch|Balewa Muhammad]], and produced by the former two, the song draws influence from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music genres. "Migrate" features American [[Rapping|rapper]] [[T-Pain]], and is based on an electronic thumping beat and many studio-crafted synthesizers, and makes use of [[Auto-Tune|auto-tune]] and several vocal processors. A strong club-beat driven track, its lyrics chronicle a night out for the protagonist, migrating from several locations including a club and hotel suite. Critics compared it to Carey's "[[It's Like That (Mariah Carey song)|It's Like That]]" for its club-themed beat, as well as its celebratory lyrics.

At the time of the album's release, "Migrate" was met with generally positive reviews, with many complimenting its strong club-beat and production, while some criticized its usage of auto-tune on Carey's voice. The song charted due to strong digital downloads in the United States during the debut week of ''E=MC<U+00B2>'', and as a result, peaked at number 92 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and appeared on several component charts. Carey performed the song live alongside T-Pain on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where she accompanied it with "[[Touch My Body]]", and on a [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] special in promotion of the album in April 2008. Additionally, it was performed during the first show on Carey's [[Angels Advocate Tour]] (2009-10) stop at [[Madison Square Garden]] on [[New Year's Eve]].

"Migrate" is a fast-paced tempo song, which draws influence from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[pop music|pop]] music genres. The song is built on a heavy electronic beat, and incorporates [[whistles]] and several studio-created synthesizers into its melody. Additionally, the song features the inclusion of [[Auto-Tune|auto-tune]] and several vocal manipulators, which are used heavily on both Carey and T-Pain's vocals. Written by Carey, [[Danja (musician)|Nathaniel Hills]], [[T-Pain|Faheem Najim]], and [[The Clutch|Balewa Muhammad]], and produced by the former two, the song was described as a "club-banger" by several music reviewers. Sarah Rodman from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' described it as "a frivolous, funky, self-referential jam, charts the flight patterns of your modern, fabulously talented urban diva",<ref name=careyon>{{cite news|url=http://articles.boston.com/2008-04-14/ae/29274502_1_charts-beatles-mimi|title=Carey's Winning Formula|last=Rodman|first=Sarah|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=2008-04-15|accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51782-2005Apr13.html|title=Grand Dames|last=Brown|first=Tina|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=April 14, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2011}}</ref> while several took notice of its electronically crafted production.<ref name=post>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/14/AR2008041403143.html|title=Mariah Sticks to Known Equation|last=De Luc|first=Freedom|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=2008-04-15|accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> Carey opens the song with several high notes in the [[whistle register]], before repeating "bounce" several times as the beat kicks in.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/1462349371.html?dids=1462349371:1462349371&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Apr+15%2C+2008&author=DAN+AQUILANTE&pub=New+York+Post&desc=SINGLE+HER+OUT!+-+MARIAH'S+UPBEAT+AND+RECORD-SETTING&pqatl=google|title=Mariah's Upbeat and Setting Records|last=Aquilina|first=Dan|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=2008-04-15|accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by W.B.M.

<Blockquote>
"Migrate," a hip-hop track about conscious independence on which Ms. Carey sings about living her life without any attachments. Sung in sassy tones over a repeating, upbeat chorus, it's the kind of assured single one would expect from [[R. Kelly]], who's known in no small part for his macho tendencies. "Migrate" displays a confident, social forwardness that is new to Ms. Carey, but it's one that she manages proudly. She's no longer looking for a "[[Dreamlover (song)|Dreamlover]]" to come and rescue her, as she did in 1993: In "Migrate," she's already rescued, and enjoying the after-party.<ref name=sun>{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/mariah-carey-solves-the-equation/74732/|title=Mariah Carey Solves Equation|last=Daniel|first=Jayanthi|work=[[The New York Sun]]|publisher=Ronald Weintraub|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref>

| style="text-align:left;"|As Carey's multi-octave voice has always been her calling card, the one thing that even her biggest critics have grudgingly acknowledged as her unassailable strength, this is a little odd -- especially on the T-Pain duet "Migrate," where she succumbs to auto-tune -- but it not only makes Mariah modern, it also camouflages her slightly diminishing range, so it does have a dual purpose."

"Migrate" was met with generally mixed reviews from music critics. While many complimented its strong beat and electronic production, some criticized its extensive usage of auto-tune. Nick Levine of [[Digital Spy]] felt Carey was "at her most diva-like" on the track, and described it as a "club tune".<ref name=digital>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/albumreviews/a93892/mariah-carey-emc2.html|title=Mariah Carey: 'E=MC<U+00B2>'|last=Levine|first=Nick|work=''[[Digital Spy]]''|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias]]|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> Writer Even Sawdey from [[PopMatters]] was critical on the track's usage of vocal processors, writing "With a descending echo-synth carrying the song almost entirely by itself, Mariah<U+2019>s voice gets thrown into countless vocoder filters, the whole thing coming off as a tepid and uninvolving attempt at a club anthem."<ref name=pop>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/mariah-carey-emc2|title=Mariah Carey: E=MC<U+00B2> < Reviews |last=Sawey|first=Evan|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=May1, 2008|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}</ref> When discussing Carey's processed vocals, ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Freedom De Luc wrote "a newly popular studio trick that needlessly distorts her greatest gift."<ref name=post>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/14/AR2008041403143.html|title=Mariah Sticks to Known Equation|last=De Luc|first=Freedom|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=2008-04-15|accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> 

''[[The New York Times]]'' critic and writer, Ben Ratliff, compared it to Carey's "[[It's Like That (Mariah Carey song)|It's Like That]]" for its club-themed beat and message, while also giving the song a mixed review. He described Carey as not exciting, and said "T-Pain, who, despite all the auto-tuning, is more exciting here, in 'Migrate', than Ms. Carey; he runs off his verses with a lot more flexibility and swing. Her part is a questionably sexy act of concealment."<ref name=newyorktimes>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/arts/music/14choi.html|title=New CDs|last=Ratliff|first=Ben|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=2008-04-16|accessdate=2011-08-05}}</ref> ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' critic, David Hinckley, described the vocal effects as "a move more appropriate to stars who can't sing a lick", and questioned why Carey opted to use it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-04-15/entertainment/17896459_1_songs-bryan-michael-cox-sounds|title=Maraih Carey's Bland Ambition Patently Obvious|last=Hinckley|first=David|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|publisher=Mortimer Zuckerman|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> Fred Boggard from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' was less critical, calling it a "titanic future crunk smash".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/sftw/article1026793.ece|title=My Dog Has A Bigger Ego|last=Swift|first=Jacqui|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Wichita Eagle]]'', Mary Moore's review on the song was positive, outing it as a "an irresistible hip-hop groove that works".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WE&s_site=kansas&p_multi=WE&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=12040CB1A9DDDD70&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=E=MC<U+00B2> is a Hit; Mariah Carey Proves She's Still Deserving of Her Pop Princess Title|last=Moore|first=Mary|work=[[The Wichita Eagle]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=2008-04-20|accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>
