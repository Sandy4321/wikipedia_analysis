'''Charleston Lake Provincial Park''' is located on [[Charleston Lake]] near [[Athens, Ontario|Athens]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] in the township of [[Leeds and the Thousand Islands, Ontario|Leeds and the Thousand Islands]].

The park occupies [[1 E7 m<U+00B2>|23.53 km<U+00B2>]] in the [[Thousand Islands - Frontenac Axis|Frontenac Axis]] region, a southern extension of the [[Canadian Shield]]. The park's forests and animal life, therefore, include species normally found further north, yet the southern climate allows species more typical for the southern latitude to co-exist with the northern species.  The park includes [[hiking]] trails, swimming areas and campgrounds.

The lake includes a number of islands and has an irregular shoreline which makes it an interesting location for [[canoe]]ing and [[kayak]]ing. The trail to Blue Mountain is only accessible by water.

Blue Mountain is also accessible off Hwy #2 on Blue Mountain Rd. It is necessary to cross private land and hard-to-follow trails to reach the summit of the breathtaking 360<U+00B0> view. The trek requires approx. 2 to 2.5 hours on foot or 1.5 hrs. on bike, although cyclists must carry their bikes in many places where hard granite jets out of the earth below which forms the mountain. A compass may be useful for inexperienced hikers. 

This area was the site of a re-introduction program for the [[peregrine falcon]]. The park also provides habitat for the rare and harmless [[black rat snake]], which is also the largest snake found in eastern Ontario.
