'''William Grawn Milliken''' (born March 26, 1922), is an [[United States|American]] politician and served as the [[List of Governors of Michigan|44th]] [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]] from January 1969 to January 1983.  

==Biography==
Milliken was born in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], the son of [[James T. Milliken]], a mayor of Traverse City and a [[Michigan Senate|Michigan State Senator]] for the 27th District, 1941-50, and the grandson of [[James W. Milliken]], also a State Senator from the 27th District, 1898-1900.<ref name=graveyard>{{cite web |title=Index to Politicians: Milliken |work=The Political Graveyard |url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/milliken.html#RH801YONI |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>  William G. Milliken served in the [[United States Army Air Force]] during [[World War II]], flying fifty combat missions as a waist-gunner on [[B-24 Liberator|B-24]] bombers and survived two crash landings.<ref name=northernexpress>{{cite web |title=The Very Best People |author=Downes,Robert |work=Northern Express |url=http://www.northernexpress.com/editorial/features.asp?id=67 |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>

===Governor of Michigan===
Like his father and grandfather, Milliken was elected as a state senator from the 27th District, serving from 1961 to 1964.  He was the [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|52nd Lieutenant Governor of Michigan]] from 1965 to 1969, and became governor after [[George W. Romney]] left office to serve in President [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] cabinet.  Milliken was subsequently elected to full four-year terms in 1970, 1974, and 1978.  He was considered to be a moderate Republican governor in the [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] mold.  In June 1982 the governor led the formation of the [[Council of Great Lakes Governors]].

Milliken was governor for 14 years and is the longest-serving governor in state history.  With governors now [[term limit|limited]] to two elected terms in office, it is unlikely that any will serve longer than Milliken.

In December 1982, Milliken appointed [[Dorothy Comstock Riley]] to the [[Michigan Supreme Court]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[Blair Moody]].  Riley had run for election to the Supreme Court in the 1982 general election and had been defeated.  Milliken was leaving office in less than a month and newly-elected [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] Governor [[James Blanchard]] argued he should have made the appointment to replace Moody rather than Milliken.  In 1983, the other Supreme Court Justices voted 4-2 to remove Riley from the court. Riley was elected to the Court in 1984.

===Former governor===
In 2004, Milliken broke with party ranks to endorse [[John Kerry]] in his bid to unseat [[George W. Bush]] as [[President of the United States]]: "The truth is that President George W. Bush does not speak for me or for many other moderate Republicans on a very broad cross section of issues."<ref name=KerrySupport>{{cite web |title=Statement by William G. Milliken |work=Traverse City Record Eagle |date=2004-10-18 |url=http://www.record-eagle.com/2004/oct/18mil2.htm |accessdate=2006-06-07}}</ref>

In 2008 Governor Milliken endorsed [[John McCain]] for President, but backed away from his endorsement in October after McCain's campaign began attacking Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]]. Milliken told the ''[[Grand Rapids Press]]'' "He is not the John McCain I endorsed."  Milliken voiced disquiet at the direction of the Republican Party: "Increasingly, the party is moving toward rigidity, and I don't like that. I think [[Gerald Ford]] would hold generally the same view I'm holding on the direction of the Republican Party."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.mlive.com/grpress/news/index.ssf/2008/10/former_governor_milliken_backs.html | title=Former governor Milliken backs away from McCain | publisher=''[[Grand Rapids Press]]'' | first=Pat | last=Shellenbarger | date=2008-10-10 | accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref>

==Honors==
In fall 2009, the state of Michigan named a new state park ([[William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor]]) in honor of the former Governor.<ref name="DNR">{{cite web |url=  http://www.dnr.state.mi.us/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=697&type=SPRK
