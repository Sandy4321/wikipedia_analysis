'''Poppo von Osterna''' was the ninth [[Grand Master]] of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] (1252 - 1257).

Poppo hailed from a family with rich [[knight]]ly traditions from [[Franconia]] which resided in [[Osternohe]], just outside [[Nuremberg]]. He joined the Teutonic Order in [[1228]]. He was one of the first friars to settle in [[Prussia]]. In [[1233]], Poppo von Osterna took part in localisation of the town of [[Che<U+0142>mno]]. He became the Prussian Master in [[1240]] and in [[1241]] fought in the [[Battle of Legnica]] although the participation of the Teutonic Knights in the battle is questionable. In [[1242]] Poppo von Osterna went to [[Austria]] with a Teutonic [[legation]] to collect money for war with the [[Duke of Pomerania]], [[<U+015A>wi<U+0119>tope<U+0142>k II]]. Between [[1248]] and [[1253]], Poppo von Osterna resided in [[Germany]] and in [[1253]], he became the ninth Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.
Due to the conflict within the Order, with the possibiliy of the Order being dissolved, the pro-papal minority did not agree with the [[capitulum]]'s choice and in [[1253]] they chose [[Wilhelm von Urenbach]] as their Grand Master.
After being chosen the Grand Master, Poppo von Osterna went to [[Prussia]] to start a war against the [[Sudovians]].
In [[1254]] he went with a legation to the king of [[Bohemia]] [[Ottokar II]] and as a result, he received much needed military help to start crusades in [[Sambia]].
The crusades took place in 1254 and in [[1255]] and after the conquest of Sambia, Poppo von Osterna built several castles around the [[Vistula Lagoon]], including [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]].
