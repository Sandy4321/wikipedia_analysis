The '''Olympic Committee of Portugal''' ({{lang-pt|Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal}}; [[Pronunciation|pron.]] {{IPA2|kumi<U+02C8>t<U+025B> o<U+02C8>l<U+0129>piku d<U+0268> pu<U+027E>tu<U+02C8>ga<U+026B>}}; [[acronym]]: COP) is a [[non-profit organisation]] of [[public utility]], which serves as the [[National Olympic Committee]] (NOC) for [[Portugal]]. It was founded on [[October 26]], [[1909]], to ensure a timely, methodical and state-sponsored participation at the [[1912 Summer Olympics|Games of the V Olympiad]], in [[Stockholm]]. Thus, it was the 13th nation to join the [[Olympic Movement]].

As a NOC, its responsibilities include the setup and management of a delegation for the [[Olympic Games]], and [[fundraising]] to support Olympic-related sports development programmes, by cooperation with public and private entities. A universe of 64 national sports federations is assembled under the COP's wing as members with voting power. This intimate relationship with the federations helps carrying their interests close to the government and official organisms, and ensures their active and decisive intervention on the committee's internal affairs.

Current president is [[Jos<U+00E9> Vicente de Moura]], elected in [[1997]] and on his third consecutive term of office. Former COP president [[Fernando Lima Bello]] is the current Portuguese delegate at the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).

==History==

Portugal had an official representative ([[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Lencastre]]) at the IOC, since [[9 June]], [[1906]], whose proposal came directly from [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]] himself, a known sports-lover.<ref name=letter>{{cite news |url=http://www.onortedesportivo.com/?op=artigo&sec=6512bd43d9caa6e02c990b0a82652dca&subsec=158f3069a435b314a80bdcb024f8e422&id=a2fa09f7e331c73ec8ba3b64b846d7dd |title=100 Anos de Olimpismo - A Mem<U+00F3>ria Esquecida |last=Pires |first=Gustavo |publisher=O Norte Desportivo Online |date=2006-06-10 |accessdate=2007-02-15 |language=Portuguese and French}}</ref><ref name=letter2>{{cite news |url=http://www.onortedesportivo.com/?op=artigo&sec=6512bd43d9caa6e02c990b0a82652dca&subsec=158f3069a435b314a80bdcb024f8e422&id=506291472dfc8663ac5a00ce16a1ab2c |title=A Monarquia, o Olimpismo e a Rep<U+00FA>blica |last=Pires |first=Gustavo |publisher=O Norte Desportivo Online |date=2006-06-10 |accessdate=2007-02-15 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Nevertheless, the country lacked a proper organisation that would handle exclusively with the [[logistic]]s, fundings and preparations required for an Olympic participation.<ref name=h1912>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=113 |title=V Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Estocolmo 1912 |work=History |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-24 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> In this way, the COP's establishment on [[26 October]], [[1909]], filled this "institutional hole". However, not everyone regards this date as the official [[Olympism]]'s date of institution in Portugal. Sources defend the date when Ant<U+00F3>nio de Lencastre accepted [[Pierre de Coubertin]]'s offer ([[9 June]], [[1906]]) as the real accession date to the Olympic Movement,<ref name=letter/><ref name=letter2/> which would make this nation the 10th to do it, not the 13th, as is.<ref name=EOC>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurolympic.org/jahia/Jahia/cache/offonce/pid/406 |title=History - Portugal |work=ENOCs |publisher=European Olympic Committees (EOC) |accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref> An edition of the newspaper "Sports Ilustrado", from [[May 4]], [[1912]], even claims the COP's foundation on [[April 30]] of that year, that is, three years later than what is the currently recognised date. It is uncertain whether 1912 is the true foundation year, but it is believed that this date was not adopted later on by the COP, so that Portugal would not lose its place on the IOC founding members' list<ref name=letter2/>

The COP was developed on the structure of the now-extinct ''Sociedade Promotora de Educa<U+00E7><U+00E3>o F<U+00ED>sica Nacional'' ({{lang-en|Society for the National Promotion of Physical Education}}) whose president, [[Jaime Mauperrin Santos]], became the COP's first president.<ref name=h1912/> The primary goal for the committee's creation was to organise a mission to participate at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sweden]]. Thus, between 1910 and 1912, the COP promoted the "Games for Olympic preparation", which were a renamed version of the "National Olympic Games".<ref name=EOC/> Finally, in 1912 this goal was fulfilled and the Games of the V Olympiad were [[Portugal at the 1912 Summer Olympics|Portugal's first]].<ref name=h1912/> On [[August 14]], [[1919]], the Portuguese [[Minister of Education|Minister of Public Instruction]] signed a [[decree]], officially recognizing the COP and granting it a [[subsidy]].<ref name=h1920>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=114 |title=VII Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Antu<U+00E9>rpia 1920 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-24 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> 

In [[1925]], the COP organised the first "National [[Athletics (track and field)|Athletics]] Games" and the first "International Sports Games", which only allowed [[Amateur sports|amateur]]s to take part. The aims of these games were the promotion of sports pratice and cultural contact with other competitors, and the motivation of Portuguese [[athlete]]s to prepare themselves for a participation at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=EOC/> The delegations at the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1936 Summer Olympics]] were smaller than in previous Olympiads because of financial problems to which the government was not sensible. Nevertheless, in [[Berlin]], Portugal conquered its third Olympic medal. 

In 1939, during the 39th IOC Session, in [[London]], the Portuguese member suggested the promotion of [[roller hockey]] to [[Olympic sport]], however the committee delayed any decision.<ref name=h1940>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=120 |title=XII Olimp<U+00ED>ada - 1940 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-24 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> During [[World War II]], the IOC, taking advantage of Portugal's neutrality, used its national committee as its correspondence transmitter for the other [[Europe]]an NOCs.<ref name=h1944>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=121 |title=XIII Olimp<U+00ED>ada - 1944 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> After the war, the relationship between the COP and government became tense when the latter tried to interfere with the NOC's [[autonomy]]. As response to COP's "disobedience", state funding was canceled and the committee members had to finance themselves the Olympic participation at the [[1948 Summer Olympics|London Games]]. Surprisingly, this participation was the largest ever and the most rewarding at that time, with two medals and the first [[silver medal|silver]].<ref name=h1948>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=122 |title=XIV Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Londres 1948 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> The country's participation at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Games]] of [[Rome]] was unassured because of disagreements inside the COP structure. It was only decided on the last minute with a direct intervention of the IOC president [[Avery Brundage]], on a visit to Lisbon.<ref name=h1960>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=139 |title=XVII Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Roma 1960 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> 

In the following four years, the COP had two members elected for the newly created [[International Olympic Academy]] (1962) and started publishing its [[bimonthly]] magazine "[[Olimpo]]" ([[1964]]), which still exists.

Despite political pressure and government funding cuts, the COP set up a public fundraising campaign and, with the IOC's support, managed to send a symbolic delegation to the boycotted [[1980 Summer Olympics|Moscow Games]], thus displaying a strong loyalty to the [[Olympism|Olympic values]].<ref name=EOC/> The participation in the [[1984 Summer Olympics|following Games]] was to be, however, [[Portugal at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Portugal's best]] as [[Carlos Lopes]] paved his way to victory on the [[marathon]], and the [[A Portuguesa|national anthem]] echoed for the first time inside an Olympic stadium. On [[October 26]], [[1984]], the IOC president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] visited Portugal to take part in the 75th anniversary's ceremonies of the Portuguese presence in the Olympic Movement. Later that year, the COP celebrated the Movement's 90th anniversary of its foundation in 1894.<ref name=h1984>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=133 |title=XXIII Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Los Angeles 1984 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Three years later, the [[Portuguese Olympic Academy]] (Portuguese: ''Academia Ol<U+00ED>mpica de Portugal'', AOP) is created as an integrated organism of the COP.

After ending its presidencial term, [[Fernando Lima Bello]] was elected IOC member for Portugal, in 1989; a position he still exerts currently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/ioc/members/bio_uk.asp?id=47 |title=Fernando F. Lima Bello |work=IOC Members |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=2007-01-27}}</ref> He was succeeded on the COP leadership by current president [[Jos<U+00E9> Vicente de Moura]]. In 1991, the COP was represented at the first "European Youth Olympic Days" (now called [[European Youth Olympic Festival]], EYOF), held in [[Brussels]]. A year later, the committee approved the institution's name changing from ''Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico Portugu<U+00EA>s'' (English: ''Portuguese Olympic Committee'') to the current ''Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal''.<ref name=h1992>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=135 |title=XXV Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Barcelona 1992 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

===Meetings and events===

The COP's abilities as an organiser of international meetings and events and were shown on several occasions. Seven years after its recognition by the government, the COP convinced the IOC to hold its [[List of IOC meetings|24th Session]] in [[Lisbon]], from [[May 2|2]] to [[May 9]], [[1926]].<ref name=h1928>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=117 |title=IX Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Amesterd<U+00E3>o 1928 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-24 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> The city was also two-time host to the General Assembly of the Association of European National Olympic Committees (AENOC) <U+2014> the future [[European Olympic Committees]] association (EOC): in [[1975]], marked by the association's statutes approval, and in [[1994]].<ref name=h1976>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=131 |title=XXI Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Montreal 1976 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> In [[1985]], the city stages a well-attended meeting of the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC), with the presence of the IOC.<ref name=h1988>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=134 |title=XXIV Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Seul 1988 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> 

In [[1997]], the 4th EYOF takes place in the Portuguese capital as result of a successful COP bid. A year later, the IOC was represented at the [[Expo '98]], Lisbon's [[World's Fair]], following a three-year early invitation by the COP.

==Presidents==

Since 1909, eleven men have occupied the COP's presidency:<ref name=presidente>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=152 |title=Presidentes to Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

==Organisation==
===Structure===
The committee is composed by three social organs, namely:
* Plenary Assembly
* Executive Commission
* Auditory Council

Elections for these organs occur every first trimester of the year following that of the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. Every term (except those of the IOC members) has a duration correspondent to an [[Olympiad]], that is, 4 years. The current social organs were elected on [[March 11]], [[2005]], for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|XXIX Olympiad]] period ([[January 1]], [[2008]] <U+2013> [[December 31]], [[2012]]).

There are six other entities bound to the COP, that were created within the committee. These comprise the '''Portuguese Olympic Academy''' (AOP), the '''Olympic Athletes Commission''', and four other advisory [[commission]]s:<ref name=commission>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/comissoes.php |title=Comiss<U+00F5>es |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-28 |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

===Funding===

As a non-profit organisation, the COP's financial resources have their origin on [[donation]]s and extended financial support from private and public entities. These resources are constituted by:<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/attach_files/content_file_5.pdf |title=Regulamento Geral do Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal (Normas de aplica<U+00E7><U+00E3>o dos estatutos) |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |date=2000-03-09 |accessdate=2007-02-15 |format=pdf |language=Portuguese}}</ref>
* membership [[fee]]s;
* state (or other national public institutions), IOC and EOC subsidies;
* sponsor and [[marketing]] contracts' revenue;
* inheritances and donations;
* private subsidies and financial support, and
* income from the issue of commemorative stamps and coins.

==Objectives==
According to the [[statutes]] approved on the Plenary Assembly of [[May 7]], [[1998]], the COP's main objectives are:<ref name=statutes/>

*Spread, develop and defend the Olympic Movement and sports in general, in compliance with the [[Olympic Charter]];
*Promote taste for sports as a character-building, health-strengthening, environment-defending and social integration-promoting means;
*Fight against forbidden methods and [[doping|substances]] use, observing the IOC Medical Code regulations and cooperating with national authorities in the control of those practices;
*Promote the keeping of sporting ethics on competitions and agents relations;
*Take measures regarding the elimination of any sort of discrimination by sexual, race or religious reasons in the practice of sport and in the managing bodies;
*Participate compulsorily at the Olympic Games and organise and manage exclusively the national delegation, being responsible for the actions and behaviours of its members;

*Promote the spread of Olympism values in sport and physical education teaching programmes at school and university establishments;
*Stimulate and support the training of sports agents;
*Support the activities of the Olympic Academy, [[Olympic Museum]] or any other Olympic education and cultural program-devoted institutions related with the Olympic Movement;

*Participate with public or private entities in funding acquisition and management, to support Olympic preparation and competition-developing programs, directly or through adequate organisms;
*Support the institutionalization of the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]].

==Sports federations== 

In [[1925]], members from seven national sports federations were invited to become part of the COP's "Technical Council". This act was the first formal relationship between sports federations and a NOC, which would be considered a compulsory action by the IOC, in [[1957]].<ref name=h1928/>

Currently there are 64 sports federations linked to the COP as ordinary members, of which 30 comprise [[Olympic sport]]s (such as [[Athletics (track and field)|athletics]], [[basketball]], [[fencing]], [[judo]], [[skiing]], [[swimming]] or [[wrestling]]) and 34 supervise non-Olympic sports (such as [[autosport]], [[chess]], [[golf]], [[roller skating]] or [[surfing]]).<ref name=fed>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo.php?page=federacoes |title=Federa<U+00E7><U+00F5>es |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-24 |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

==Awards and decorations==
COP has been distinguished throughout its history by both the IOC and the Portuguese government:

* 1968 <U+2013> '''Diploma de M<U+00E9>rito Ol<U+00ED>mpico''' (''Olympic Merit Diploma'') <U+2013> handed to ceasing COP president Francisco Nobre Guedes by the IOC president Avery Brundage; '''Trof<U+00E9>u Molhasses Tear''' (''Molhasses Tear Trophee'')<U+2013> handed to COP member Rodrigo Castro Pereira by the IOC;<ref name=h1968>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiteolimpicoportugal.pt/conteudo-detalhe.php?id=129 |title=XIX Olimp<U+00ED>ada - Cidade do M<U+00E9>xico 1968 |work=Hist<U+00F3>ria |publisher=Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico de Portugal |accessdate=2007-01-25 |language=Portuguese}}</ref>

It is also COP's function to distinguish national competitors and sports-related organisations for their contribution to Portuguese sport both internally and internationally. The [[Olympic Medal Nobre Guedes]] is COP's most prestigious award for still-active Portuguese [[sportspeople]], having been given every year since [[1951]].
