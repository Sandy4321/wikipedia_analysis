The '''Northern Cardinal'''  or '''Redbird''' or '''Common Cardinal''' (''Cardinalis cardinalis'') is a North American bird in the genus ''[[Cardinalis]]''.  It can be found in southern Canada, through the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and south through Mexico.  It can also be found on the Big Island of Hawaii and on Oahu.  It is found in woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps.

The Northern Cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of 21 centimeters.  It has a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face which is black in the male and gray in the female.  The male is a vibrant red, while the female is a dull red-brown shade. The Northern Cardinal is mainly granivorous, but also feeds on insects and fruit. The male behaves [[Territory (animal)|territorially]], marking out his territory with song. During courtship, the male feeds seed to the female beak-to-beak. A clutch of three to four eggs is laid, and two to four clutches are produced each year. It was once prized as a pet, but its sale as cage birds is now banned in the [[United States]] by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]]. 
  
==Taxonomy==
The Northern Cardinal is one of three birds in the [[genus]] ''[[Cardinalis]]'' and is included in the family [[Cardinalidae]], which is made up of [[passerine]] [[bird]]s found in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].

The Northern Cardinal was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book  | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus  | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Northern Cardinal is abundant across the eastern [[United States]] from [[Maine]] to [[Texas]] and in [[Canada]] in the provinces of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and [[Nova Scotia]]. Its range extends west to the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] and south through [[Mexico]] to the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], northern [[Guatemala]], and northern [[Belize]]. It was introduced to [[Bermuda]] in 1700. It has also been introduced in [[Hawaii]] and southern [[California]]. Its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] is woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps.<ref name="BirdLife"/> This bird is a permanent resident throughout its range, although it may relocate to avoid extreme weather or if food is scarce.<ref name="Lang"/>

==Ecology==
The Northern Cardinal is a [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] song bird. The male sings in a loud, clear whistle from the top of a tree or another high location to defend his territory.  He will chase off other males entering his territory. The Northern Cardinal learns its songs, and as a result the songs vary regionally. It is able to easily distinguish the sex of another singing Northern Cardinal by its song alone.<ref>{{cite book

</ref> The Northern Cardinal has a distinctive alarm call, a short metallic 'chip' sound. This call often is given when predators approach the nest, in order to give warning to the female and nestlings.<ref name ="Ritchison"/> In some cases it will also utter a series of chipping notes. The frequency and volume of these notes increases as the threat becomes greater.<ref name ="Ritchison"/> This chipping noise is also used by a Cardinal pair to locate each other, especially during dusk hours when visibility wanes.

==Predators==
Northern Cardinals are preyed upon by a wide variety of [[predators]] native to North America, including [[Cooper's hawk]]s, [[loggerhead shrike]]s, [[Great Grey Shrike|northern shrikes]], [[eastern gray squirrel]]s, [[long-eared owl]]s and [[eastern screech owl]]s. Predators of chicks and eggs include [[Milk Snake|milk snake]]s, [[coluber constrictor]]s, [[blue jay]]s, [[fox squirrel]]s, [[red squirrel]]s and [[eastern chipmunk]]s.<ref name="Michigan"/>

===Diet===
The diet of the Northern Cardinal consists mainly (up to 90 percent) of weed seeds, grains, and fruits. It is a ground feeder and finds food while hopping on the ground through trees or shrubbery. It eats  beetles, [[cicada]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[snail]]s, wild [[fruit]] and berries, [[Maize|corn (maize)]] and [[oat]]s, sunflower seeds, the blossoms and bark of [[elm tree]]s, and drinks maple sap from holes made by [[sapsucker]]s, an example of [[commensalism]].<ref name="Terres">{{cite book| last =Terres| first =J. K.| authorlink =John Kenneth Terres| title =The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds| publisher =Knopf| year =1980| location =New York, NY| pages = 293| isbn = 0394466519 }}</ref> During the summer months, it shows preference for seeds that are easily husked, but is less selective during winter, when food is scarce. Northern Cardinals also will consume insects and feed their young almost exclusively on insects.<ref>[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cardinalis_cardinalis.html Cardinalis cardinalis: Information] Animal Diversity</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Northern cardinal hatchling.JPG|thumb|<center>Newborns before fledging]]
[[File:Female Cardinal feeding her baby.jpg|thumb|<center>Female feeding a chick]]

Mated pairs sometimes sing together before nesting.  During courtship they may also participate in a bonding behavior where the male collects food and brings it to the female, feeding her beak-to-beak.<ref name="Lang"/> If the mating is successful, this mate-feeding may continue throughout the period of incubation. 

Males sometimes bring [[nest material]] to the female, who does most of the building. She crushes twigs with her beak until they are pliable, then turns in the nest to bend the twigs around her body and push them into a cup shape with her feet. The cup has four layers: coarse twigs (and sometimes bits of trash) covered in a leafy mat, then lined with grapevine bark and finally grasses, [[stems]], [[rootlets]], and [[pine needles]]. The nest typically takes 3 to 9 days to build; the finished product is 2-3&nbsp;inches tall, 4&nbsp;inches across, with an inner diameter of about 3&nbsp;inches. Cardinals do not usually use their nests more than once. The female builds a cup [[bird nest|nest]] in a well-concealed spot in dense shrub or a low tree one to three&nbsp;meters (three to ten&nbsp;ft) off the ground. The nest is made of thin twigs, bark strips, and grasses, lined with grasses or other plant fibers.<ref name ="Harrison">{{cite book

The oldest wild Cardinal banded by researchers lived at least 15 years and 9 months, although 28.5 years was achieved by a captive bird. Annual survival rates for adult Northern Cardinals have been estimated at 60 to 65%;<ref name= Halkin>Halkin, S., S. Linville. (1999). Northern cardinal (''Cardinalis cardinalis''). Pp. 1-32 in A. Poole, F. Gill, eds. ''The Birds of North America'', Vol. 440. Philadelphia, PA: The Birds of North America.</ref> however, as with other passerine birds, the high mortality of juveniles means that the average lifespan is only about a year.

==Relationship with humans==
[[File:Northern Cardinal Fledgling-27527.jpg|thumb|<center> A  [[fledge|fledgling]] at a box feeder.]]

The Northern Cardinal is found in residential areas throughout its range
. Backyard [[Birdwatching|birders]] attract it using feeders containing seeds, particularly [[sunflower seed]]s and [[safflower]] seeds. Although some controversy surrounds [[bird feeding]] (see [[bird feeder]] for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the [[IUCN Red List]]. It has an estimated global range of 5,800,000&nbsp;square kilometers (2,239,392.5&nbsp;sq mi) and a global population estimated to be about 100,000,000 individuals.<ref name="BirdLife"/> Populations appear to remain stable and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations.<ref name="BirdLife">{{cite web | title = Species factsheet: ''Cardinalis cardinalis'' | author= | publisher =BirdLife International | url =http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/150308/0| accessdate = 2007-11-06}}</ref> It was once prized as a pet due to its bright color and distinctive song.<ref name="Wright">{{cite book

In the [[United States]], the Northern Cardinal is the mascot of a number of athletic teams. In professional sports, it is the mascot of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] of [[Major League Baseball]] and the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]]. In college athletics, it is the mascot of many schools, including the [[University of Louisville]],  the [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh]], [[Ball State University]], [[Illinois State University]], the [[Catholic University of America]], [[Wesleyan University]], [[Wheeling Jesuit University]], [[Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences]], [[North Idaho College]] and [[Saint John Fisher College]]. It is also the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]] of seven states, more than any other species: [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]], [[Ohio]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]]. It was also a candidate to become the state bird of [[Delaware]], but lost to the [[Blue Hen of Delaware]].
