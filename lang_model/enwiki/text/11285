==Plot==
{{plot}}

Harold Lee, working at an investment bank, is told to finish some important files over the weekend by two co-workers, who are in fact slacking off in order to party with some hookers. Meanwhile, his best friend Kumar Patel is being interviewed for medical school. Harold calls him, and Kumar is preoccupied with the conversation, telling Harold that they are going to hang out and smoke marijuana, whether Harold wants to or not. Kumar's interviewer overhears the entire conversation and promptly rejects Kumar from medical school. 

Later on, Harold returns to their apartment building. He goes into the elevator and finds that he is next to Maria, his crush. After enduring an awkward elevator ride, Harold goes to the apartment he and Kumar share. Harold and Kumar smoke weed and get [[hunger|the munchies]]. After watching television for a while, they see a commercial for [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] and suddenly have an urge to go there and eat some burgers. They decide to visit a nearby [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. While driving on the [[Garden State Parkway]], the toll machine does not accept the coins that Kumar has thrown in. Being harassed by cars behind them, Kumar runs the toll and Harold, paranoid that the cops will pull them over, throws the pair's last joint out of the car. They end up taking a detour through [[Newark, New Jersey]]. The duo quickly drive back onto the Parkway.  Harold and Kumar get there, only to discover the restaurant has been closed. The White Castle has been replaced by another fast-food restaurant, which uses animal semen in its special sauces. Told by an employee ([[Anthony Anderson]]) that there is another White Castle about 45 minutes away in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]], they decide to head there.

They stop at [[Princeton University]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] and visit Harold's friend, Cyndi Kim, who has Harold be her guest of honor at her [[affinity group|East Asian Students Club]] meeting. Kumar looks for someone to sell him marijuana, eventually buying from a "business hippie," who raises the price of the drug to an unfair level. Two college girls show up, and through some smooth talking, Kumar gets their room number and is told to meet them in 20 minutes to "smoke a little weed, have some fun." He then ditches the hippie and meets up with Harold. They light up a joint in the hallway, but are soon forced run away from campus police. The two girls enter the bathroom, and Kumar and Harold stand together on a toilet. The boys hear the girls play a game of "Battleshits," where each player has to out-fart the other. Harold accidentally drop the weed into the toilet, then they run out of the bathroom. 

The two head off the road when Kumar has to go into to woods to [[urinate]]. Kumar returns to the car, which, unbeknownst to both Harold and Kumar, now contains a racoon. Harold and Kumar do not notice the raccoon until it attacks Harold. Insisting that he has rabies, Harold makes Kumar drive him to a hospital for treatment. Once there, they learn Harold is not rabid and attempt to steal [[medical marijuana]]. This hospital visit provides an inconvenient meeting with Kumar's father and brother, both of whom are disgruntled to see again that Kumar is straying away from the medical profession. Kumar apologizes to them and gives them a hug. He steals an access card from them and plans to use it to get marijuana. While looking for marijuana, the two are mistaken for doctors and forced to perform surgery on a wounded man.  After a failed attempt to convince the nurse that marijuana is needed to sedate the patient, Kumar performs flawless surgery on the patient. After the patient is revived, Kumar asks him directions to the nearest White Castle.

Harold and Kumar see Maria outside a movie theater.  While Kumar is trying to get her attention, Harold panics and presses the gas pedal and flees the scene. The car goes out of control, careening down a wooded embankment and getting a flat tire. Since Harold has no spare, the duo is forced to accept help from a passing tow truck driver named Freak Show. Freak Show is a hideous man whose face and neck are covered in [[boil|boils]].  While fixing their tire, Freak Show allows Harold and Kumar to go into his house, even implying that they can have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with his wife.  Surprisingly, Freak Show's wife is extremely attractive, and she comes on to both Harold and Kumar, offering them [[oral sex]].  However, before anything can happen, Freak Show reenters, forgetting his earlier offer and threatening Harold and Kumar.  On being reminded of his proposal, Freak Show suggests a four-way, leading Harold and Kumar to flee, promising never to speak of the incident again.

Back on the road, they pick up [[Neil Patrick Harris]] who, high on [[MDMA|ecstasy]], steals their car, after the duo is distracted by the extreme sport hooligans who are tormenting an [[India]]n [[convenience store]] [[clerk]] and participating in [[extreme sports|Xtreme kayaking]]. After jaywalking to reach a pay phone, Harold is beaten and taken to jail following a misunderstanding with a clearly-racist police officer who refers to Kumar as [[Apu]]. While in prison, he meets a middle-aged black man who was also imprisoned by the same racist police reading [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s essay ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]''. The man explains he was only captured due to the fact that the criminal turned out to be black, he is, in fact, a Rutegers University professor, but he finds solace in the fact that he has a very large [[penis]]. He explains how people have picked on him his whole life due to the fact that he is fat, black, can not dance, and has two homosexual fathers.  He tells him not to get angry, because the universe tends to balance itself out. Kumar calls the cops with a phony story about a shooting in the area, to which all the officers respond. He then proceeds to break Harold out of the police station. But before he can, he spots some weed and daydreams of a white collar life with the weed, first envisioning a fairy-tale relationship, immediately followed by an abusive one.

Shortly after escaping, Harold and Kumar smoke some of the weed and spot a runaway cheetah. After it smokes some weed as well, they proceed to ride the cheetah through the woods. But Harold is knocked unconscious after falling off of the cheetah and dreams about having sex with Maria. He wakes up with Kumar on top of him, discovering that the cheetah has run away and the laptop containing all his work is destroyed. They go to a store and find the extreme sports guys once again taunting them. They eventually throw a rubber ball at Harold's forehead, causing a scar. But knowing what the black guy said about the universe unfolding as it should, they determine that hope is not lost. They then turn things around by capitalizing on the keys left in the punks' [[Ford Bronco]], and steal it. They realize the extreme sports guys are nothing more then posers as a cassette in the vehicle reveals they listen to romantic ballads sung by female artists.

After stealing the Bronco they are chased by a cop who is after the punks, causing them to nearly drive off of a cliff. Seeing a White Castle below them, the two take a hang glider from the roof of the jeep and glide down to it, escaping the police. At White Castle, an apologetic Neil Patrick Harris shows up and offers to pay for the food as a sort of peace offering for stealing their car. After eating their meal, Kumar reflects over the events throughout the movie and concludes that he will go to his interview scheduled that day. Meanwhile, Harold sees the two co-workers from the start of the film pulling into White Castle. Apparently they have been out all night with two women. Now feeling confident in himself, Harold tells off his co-workers, stating he will no longer do their work for them and (quite loudly) threatens to tell everybody that they contracted [[gonorrhea]] from two hookers; ending any chance the co-workers might have with the women, who were listening nearby.

Arriving back at their apartment building, the pair runs into Harold's love interest, Maria,  and he kisses her. She says she is going on a trip to [[Amsterdam]]. Kumar persuades Harold that the two should join her on her trip to Amsterdam because marijuana is legal there. On the TV news, it is reported that authorities are looking for the two men. The pictures, drawn based on their descriptions, show a stereotypical Asian with squinting eyes in a [[conical straw hat]] and a [[Sikh]] in a [[turban]].

==Stereotyping and racism==
{{OR|section|date=June 2007}}
[[Image:Haroldandkumar14.jpg|thumb|right|Harold meets a man who was thrown in jail for being black.]]
As [[Asian Week]] put it, ''Harold and Kumar'' takes the [[model minority]] on a road trip.<ref>[http://news.asianweek.com/news/view_article.html?article_id=b1d1c17f8b2022a96284820762ea6812&this_category_id=172] Steamed At <U+2018>Cars<U+2019> Asian Week. Jun 30, 2006</ref> The movie examines racial discrimination and [[stereotype|stereotyping]], though not deeply enough to offset the comedy.  Another ''[[Asian Week]]'' review of the movie's weak box office performance questioned whether casting two Asian men had contributed to its limited acceptance.

Harold says he is constantly faced with the stereotype of the "intelligent and nerdy East Asian guy," but fears being called a [[Twinkie]]<U+2014>"yellow on the outside, white on the inside"<U+2014> by his Korean friends.

Kumar, despite having incredible [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] scores, refuses to attend [[medical school]] as his family wishes, explaining that "just because you're hung like a moose doesn't mean you have to do porn." Also, he's "afraid of being one of those nerdy [[Indian]] guys turned doctor." 

Rosenberg and Goldstein are Harold and Kumar's [[Jew|Jewish]] friends/counterparts. Rosenberg wears a [[yarmulke]], they smoke pot from a [[shofar]] and speak with [[Yiddish]] accents.

Racism at the hands of local police is also explored in the movie. When Harold begins jaywalking across the street to use a pay phone, a white police officer named Palumbo tickets him, is unwilling to even listen to the suggestion that Neil Patrick Harris has stolen his car. After a minor argument which ends with Harold accidentally punching the officer, he is taken to the local police station.

Harold finds that his cellmate Tarik, a Rutgers professor, has been charged with theft, just for accurately fitting the description of an [[African American]] robbery suspect from Newark. When Kumar makes a false report of gunfire coming from a black man to bust Harold out, the police capture another [[African American]] man who was at home<U+2014>away from the crime scene. At the end of the movie, Tarik and the other African American man, Nathaniel, file a lawsuit alleging discrimination against the local police. Led by Palumbo, the police angrily protest the lawsuit, referring to Tarik and Nathaniel as [[Darkie|Darkies]]. When they describe Harold and Kumar to a sketch artist, the sketch yields a stereotypical and racist drawing of people from China and India.

==Box office==
The movie grossed $5,480,378 on its opening weekend (on 2,163 theaters, average of $2,566 per screen), for a total domestic gross of $18,250,550, and $5,456,143 overseas, a total of $23,706,693 worldwide gross <ref>http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=haroldandkumar.htm</ref>.

==Location==
The actual White Castle Restaurant was filmed at the (now closed) Swift Burger Restaurant in [[Caledon, Ontario]], [[Canada]].

The Cherry Hill White Castle location is fictional.  The ending scene looks nothing like the real, relatively flat Cherry Hill. In reality, at least four White Castles are within five miles of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] where Harold and Kumar reside: [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Manhattan]], [[Union City, New Jersey|Union City]], and [[North Bergen, New Jersey|North Bergen]].<ref>[http://www.whitecastle.com/_pages/find.asp?frm_city=&frm_state=&frm_zip=07030&frm_radius=5/ White Castle locations within 5 miles of Hoboken]</ref> Additionally, there is a White Castle location in New Brunswick, New Jersey, at 680 Somerset Street.<ref>[http://www.whitecastle.com/_pages/find.asp?frm_city=&frm_state=&frm_zip=08901&frm_radius=10/ White Castle locations in New Brunswick]</ref> The film suggests that White Castle locations are few and far between in New Jersey, while there are actually 24 shops in the state.<ref>[http://www.whitecastle.com/_pages/retailerpopup.asp?state=New%20Jersey White Castle locations in New Jersey]</ref>  In addition to these, there is a White Castle on Route 35 in Eatontown New Jersey, currently under renovation.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  There used to be a White Castle located in [[Pennsauken, New Jersey]], bordering Cherry Hill, however that location has since been knocked down and replaced by a Super [[Wawa Food Markets|Wawa]].

The opening office scene was filmed at the Steelestech office building located on the border of [[Toronto]] and Markham on the Toronto side. A few scenes were also shot in [[Mississauga]] and in [[Etobicoke]], [[suburb]]s west of Toronto. Most of the college scenes were also filmed in [[Canada]] &mdash; at the [[University of Toronto|University of Toronto's]] [[Hart House]] and Knox College. The scene before Kumar's medical interview was a shot of Bovard Auditorium on the campus of the [[University of Southern California]]. In the scenes shot in Canada, Canadian retail companies such as [[Shoppers Drug Mart]] and [[Country Style]] can be seen in the background.  Additionally, in the interior gas station scene, Canadian cigarette brands can be seen to the right of the American brands.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Because of the lack of White Castle Restaurants in most West coast states, many viewers from there area were confused by the title.  Although the movie poster showed a White Castle logo with a burger, few West Coasters made the connection that it was the name of a fast food chain.

==Harold & Kumar End Up in Gitmo==

==Trivia==
{{trivia|date=May 2007}}
*Throughout the movie, Kumar can be seen wearing a [[Meekrab]] t-shirt. Meekrab was a band co-founded by the nephew of director [[Danny Leiner]], now defunct. 
*Certain portions of the film were edited out of U.S. cable television releases of the film, including  those where 1) Kumar calls police with a phony story about a shooting to clear the police station; 2) Kumar's daydreams of an abusive life powered by marijuana smoking; 3) discovery of a romantic cassette in the extreme sports guys' vehicle; 4) the black prisoners' lawsuit at the end of the film; 5) the two British women's 'battle' in the bathroom; 6) the reference to animal semen in a competing burger chain's 'special' sauces; and, most notably, 7) the final TV news gag of a highly racist sketch of the two lead actors, based on police descriptions.
*It is number 95 on [[Bravo (television network)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies."
*[[Bobby Lee]] made a cameo appearance as one the members of the East Asian Students Club

This exchange references both [[Doogie Howser, MD]] and the 2000 comedy film [[Dude, Where's My Car]], a story of two stoners who wake up from a night of wild partying to find out their car is missing and journey to find it.
*When Harold tries to park in front of his building, the Extreme punks cut into his parking space and one says, "Better ruck tomorrow!"; this could be a reference to the 2002 film [[Better Luck Tomorrow]], starring John Cho.
