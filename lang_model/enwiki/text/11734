'''Eleanor Brooksby''' was a British noblewoman who, along with her sister [[Anne Voux]], supported [[Catholics]] in England during the 16th century by providing safe houses including [[Baddesley Clinton]] in [[Warwickshire]] and [[White Webbs]] in [[Enfield Chase]] near London for Jesuit missionaries such as [[Henry Garnett]] and was later involved in the [[Gunpowder Plot]].

In 1605, she and Voux attended a pilgrimage of Catholic recusants to [[Holywell]] refusing to plege their alliengence to King [[James I of England]] which was suspected as a cover for the Gunpowder Plot by authorities.
