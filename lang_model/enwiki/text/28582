==Career==
===Youth and College===
Ko<U+010D>i<U+0107> was born in [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] prior to that country's breakup in the aftermath of the [[Bosnian war]]. He began playing soccer in the [[Serbian League East]], and was part of the youth system of his home town team [[FK Dubo<U+010D>ica|Dubo<U+010D>ica Leskovac]]<ref>http://dcunited.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20090210&content_id=217074&vkey=news_dcu&fext=.jsp&team=t103</ref> before coming to the United States in 2004.
