==Biography==
===Early life===
Lovett was born in North Harris County, Texas, in the community of [[Klein, Texas|Klein]], the son of William and Bernell ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Klein) Lovett, a marketing executive and training specialist, respectively. He was raised in the [[Lutheran Church<U+2013>Missouri Synod]].<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1501840 NPR Music: Lyle Lovett: 'My Baby Don't Tolerate'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Lovett attended [[Texas A&M University]], where he studied [[German language|German]] and [[journalism]]. It is a common misconception that Lyle and [[Robert Earl Keen]] were roommates at A&M. They were not. However, they lived across from each other on Church St. in College Station, became good friends, and wrote "The Front Porch Song" together,  which both went on to record.

===Career===
Lovett's [[music]] career began as a [[songwriter]], but he soon signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1986 and released his eponymous debut album. While typically associated with the [[country music|country]] genre, Lovett's compositions often incorporate [[Folk music|folk]], [[Swing (genre)|swing]], [[blues]], [[jazz]] and [[gospel music]] as well as more traditional country & Western styling. He has won four [[Grammy Awards]], including Best Country Album (1996 for ''The Road to Ensenada''), Best Country Duo/Group with Vocal (1994 for "Blues For Dixie" with the Texas swing group [[Asleep at the Wheel]]), Best Pop Vocal Collaboration (1994 for "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]" with [[Al Green]]) and Best Country Male Vocal (1989) for ''Lyle Lovett and His Large Band'').

Lovett has acted in a number of films, including [[Robert Altman]]'s films: ''[[The Player]]'' (1992), ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993), ''[[Pr<U+00EA>t-<U+00E0>-Porter (film)|Pr<U+00EA>t-<U+00E0>-Porter]]'' (1994), ''[[Cookie's Fortune]]'' (1999), and composed for ''[[Dr. T & the Women]]'' (2000).  More recently, he has acted in ''[[The New Guy]]'' (2002) and ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' (2007). His [[television]] acting forays include ''[[Mad About You]]'', ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]'' and ''[[Dharma & Greg]]''.

Lovett was given an award called an "Esky" for Surest Thing in [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire's]] 2006 Esky Music Awards in the April issue. The magazine said of Lovett: "The secret of Lyle Lovett's endurance comes down to the three C's: class, [[charisma]] and consistency... In  the studio and on stage with his giant orchestra, he's spent two decades gracefully matching genuine songcraft with A-list musicianship".

Lovett primarily plays [[Collings Guitars|Collings acoustic guitars]].<ref>[http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/06/play-guitar-lik.html Fretbase: Play Guitar Like Lyle Lovett]</ref>

In 2010 Lovett appeared on an episode of ''[[Spectacle: Elvis Costello with...]]'' which also featured [[John Prine]] and [[Ray LaMontagne]].

Lovett has recently contributed a cover of Buddy Holly's "[[Well... All Right]]" for the tribute album ''[[Listen to Me: Buddy Holly]]'', released on September 6, 2011.

===Personal life===
Lovett's personal life was brought to the fore in 1993 when he married actress [[Julia Roberts]]. The couple had met on the set of ''The Player'' in 1992. After a three-week romance, they eloped and married in June 1993 in [[Marion, Indiana]]. The couple divorced less than two years later, in March 1995. The breakup was said to be caused by career demands. The two remained friends, and Roberts even sang a Townes Van Zandt song previously recorded by Lovett in the 1998 movie ''Stepmom''.  

Lovett has been dating April Kimble since 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.madison.com/tct/mad/entertainment/296067|title=Lovett shows he's still an original}}</ref>

On March 28, 2002 Lovett was caught by a bull and rammed into a fence on his uncle's farm in [[Klein, Texas]], before being pulled to safety. He fully recovered after six months and began touring again in the summer of 2003.

Lovett was conferred the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] by the [[University of Houston]] on May 15, 2010 at its general commencement ceremony.<ref name="University of Houston">{{cite web |url = http://www.uh.edu/features/on-campus/Lyle-Lovett/index.php|title = Musician Recalls Early Connection to University of Houston|publisher=[[University of Houston]] | accessdate = 2010-05-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2010articles/May2010/05132010Commencement.php|title = The University of Houston to Graduate More Than 4,500 Students|publisher=[[University of Houston]] | accessdate = 2010-05-16 }}</ref>  His mother was in the audience as her son was presented with an honorary doctorate from the same university she had received her bachelor's degree in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.chron.com/news/photogallery/UH_graduation.html#21668742|title = Singer and songwriter Lyle Lovett received an honorary degree during the ceremony|publisher=''Houston Chronicle'' | accessdate = 2010-05-16 }}</ref>  His late father was also a graduate of the University of Houston.<ref name="University of Houston"/>
