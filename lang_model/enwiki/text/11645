'''Yellowstone National Park''' is a  [[United States National Park|U.S. National Park]]  located in the [[Western United States|western states]] of [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], and [[Idaho]]. Yellowstone is the first [[national park]] established in the world and covers 3,468 square miles (8,983&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), mostly in the northwest corner of [[Wyoming]]. The park is famous for its various [[geyser]]s, [[hot spring]]s, [[supervolcano]] and [[Geothermal areas of Yellowstone|other geothermal features]] and is home to [[grizzly bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], and free-ranging herds of [[American Bison|bison]] and [[Elk (Cervus canadensis)|elk]]. It is the core of the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]], one of the largest intact [[temperate zone]] [[ecosystems]] remaining on the planet. The world's most famous geyser, the [[Old Faithful Geyser]], is also located in Yellowstone National Park.

Long before any recorded [[human]] history in Yellowstone, a massive [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] spewed an immense volume of [[Volcanic ash|ash]] that covered all of the [[US Western States|Western U.S.]], much of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern U.S.]], Northern [[Mexico]] and some areas of the [[Pacific Coast]]. The eruption dwarfed that of [[Mount St. Helens]] in 1980 and left a huge [[caldera]] 43&nbsp;miles by 18&nbsp;miles (70&nbsp;km by 30&nbsp;km) sitting over a huge magma chamber (see Geology section and [[Yellowstone Caldera]]).  Yellowstone has registered three major volcanic eruption events in the last 2.2&nbsp;million years with the last event occurring 640,000 years ago.  Its eruptions are the largest known to have occurred on Earth within that timeframe, producing drastic climate change in the aftermath (See also: [[Supervolcano]]).

The park received its name from its location at the headwaters of the [[Yellowstone River]]. [[France|French]] [[Animal trapping|trappers]] gave this river the name "Roche Jaune," probably a translation of the [[Hidatsa]] name "Mi tsi a-da-zi," and the later American trappers rendered the French name into English as "Yellow Stone." Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the [[Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone]], the Native American source name more likely derived from the yellowish bluffs located near present-day [[Billings, Montana]].

==Early history==
The human history of the park begins at least 11,000 [[years]] ago when [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] first began to [[hunt]] and [[Fishing|fish]] in the Yellowstone region. These [[Paleo-indians]] were of the [[Clovis culture]] and they used the significant amounts of [[obsidian]] found in the park to make [[cutting tool]]s and [[weapon]]s. [[Arrowhead]]s made of Yellowstone [[obsidian]] have been found as far away as the [[Mississippi Valley]], indicating that a regular obsidian [[trade]] existed between local tribes and tribes farther east.<ref name="Janetski">{{cite book| last = Janetski| first = Joel C. | title = Indians in Yellowstone National Park| publisher = University of Utah Press | date = 1987| location = Salt Lake City, Utah| id = ISBN 0-87480-724-7}}</ref> By the time white explorers first entered the region during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1805, they encountered the [[Nez Perce]], [[Crow Indians|Crow]] and [[Shoshone]] tribes. While passing through present day Montana, the expedition members were informed of the Yellowstone region to the south, but did not investigate it.<ref name="Janetski"/>

In [[1806]] a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition named [[John Colter]] left the Expedition to join a group of fur trappers. After splitting up with the other trappers in [[1807]], Colter passed through a portion of what later became the park, during the winter of 1807-1808, and observed at least one [[geothermal]] area in the northeastern section of the park, near [[Tower Falls]].<ref name="Haines">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Lewis and Clark Era (1805-1814)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1a.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref> After surviving wounds he suffered in a battle with members of the Crow and [[Blackfoot]] [[tribes]] in [[1809]], he gave a description of a place of "fire and brimstone" that was dismissed by most people as delirium. The supposedly imaginary place was nicknamed "Colter's Hell." Over the next forty years, numerous reports from [[Mountain man|mountain men]] and trappers told of boiling mud, steaming rivers and [[Petrifaction|petrified]] trees and animals, yet most of these reports were believed at the time to be  myth.<ref name="Haines2">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Fur Trade Era (1818-42)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1b.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref>  

After an 1856 exploration, mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] reported observing boiling springs, spouting water, and a mountain of glass and yellow rock. Because Bridger was known for being a "spinner of yarns" these reports were largely ignored. Nonetheless, his stories did arouse the interest of explorer and geologist [[F.V. Hayden]], who, in 1859, started a two-year survey of the upper [[Missouri River]] region with [[United States Army]] surveyor W.F. Raynolds and Bridger as a guide. After exploring the [[Black Hills]] region of in what is now the state of [[South Dakota]], the party neared the Yellowstone region, but heavy snows forced them to turn away. The intervening [[American Civil War]] prevented any further attempts to explore the region until the late 1860s.<ref name="Haines3">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Exploring Era (1851-63)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 1975| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee1c.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-14}}</ref>

The first detailed expedition to the Yellowstone area was the [[Folsom Expedition]] of 1869, which consisted of three privately funded explorers. The members of the Folsom party followed the Yellowstone River to [[Yellowstone Lake]] and kept a journal of their findings.<ref name="Haines4">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = The Folsom Party (1869)| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee2b.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref> Based on the information it reported, in 1870 a party of [[Montana]] residents organized the [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition]], headed by the surveyor-general of Montana [[Henry Washburn]]. Amongst the group was [[Nathaniel P. Langford]], who would later become known as "National Park" Langford, and a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] detachment commanded by Lt. Gustavus Doane. The expedition spent about a month exploring the region, collecting specimens, and naming sites of interest. A Montana writer and lawyer named Cornelius Hedges, who had been a member of the Washburn expedition, proposed that the region should be set aside and protected as a National Park (though most likely not in front of National Park Mountain in 1870 as Langford later claimed), and wrote a number of detailed articles about his observations for the Helena Herald newspaper between 1870-1871. Hedges essentially reinstated comments made in October of 1865 by acting Territorial Governor [[Thomas Francis Meagher]], who had previously commented that the region should be protected.<ref name="Haines5">{{cite web| last = Haines| first = Aubrey L.| title = Cornelius Hedges| work = Yellowstone National Park: Its Exploration and Establishment | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/haines1/iee4a.htm#hedges| accessdate = 2006-11-15}}</ref>

==Park creation and later history of the park==
In 1871, eleven years after his failed first effort, F.V. Hayden was finally able to make another attempt at his exploration of the region. Now government sponsored, Hayden successfully returned to Yellowstone with a second, larger expedition. He compiled a comprehensive report on Yellowstone which included large-format photographs by [[William Henry Jackson]] and paintings by [[Thomas Moran]]. This report helped to convince the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] to withdraw this region from public auction and on [[March 1]], [[1872]], President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed a bill into law that created Yellowstone National Park.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/gegr/ General Grant National Memorial] by the National Park Service. Retrieved March 29, 2006.</ref>

"National Park" Langford, a member of both the 1870 and 1871 expeditions, was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872. He served for five years, but without salary, funding, or staff, he lacked the means to improve the lands or implement any kind of protection to the park. Without formal policy or regulations put into place, he lacked any legal method to enforce such protection were it available to him.  This left Yellowstone vulnerable to  poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. As a result, Langford was forced to step down in 1877.<ref name="nps">{{cite web| last = | first = | title = Yellowstone National Park's First 130 Years|work = Yellowstone History| publisher = National Park Service| url = http://windowsintowonderland.org/history/army&nps/page3.htm| accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> 
[[Image:Fort Yellowstone-750px.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Fort Yellowstone, formerly a [http://www.nps.gov/yell/tours/ftyell/index.htm U.S. Army base], now serves as the administration headquarters for Yellowstone National Park.]]

Having traveled through Yellowstone and witnessed these problems first hand, [[Philetus Norris]] volunteered for the position after Langford's exit. Congress finally saw fit to implement a salary for the position as well as a minimal amount of funds to operate the park. Norris used these monies to expand access to the park, building numerous new, albeit crude, roads, as well as further exploring Yellowstone.<ref name="nps"/> He also hired [[Harry Yount]] to control poaching and vandalism in the park. Today, Harry Yount is considered the first national park ranger.<ref name="nps"/> These measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park though, as neither Norris, nor the three superintendents who followed, were able to effective protect many of Yellowstone's natural resources due to lack of funding and manpower.

The [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] built a station at the northern entrance to the park in the early 1880's, increasing visitation to 5,000 by 1883. Visitors in these early years were faced with poor roads and extremely limited services and all access into the park was done on horse or via [[stagecoach]].<ref name="nps"/>

Ongoing poaching and destruction of natural resources continued unabated until the U.S Army arrived at [[Mammoth Hot Springs]] in 1886 and built Camp Sheridan. Over the next 22 years the army constructed permanent structures which became known as [[Fort Yellowstone]].<ref name="nps"/> With the funding and manpower necessary to keep a diligent watch, the army developed their own policies and regulations that provided public access while protecting park wildlife and natural resources. When the [[National Park Service]] was created in 1916, it would take its lead largely from the army's successful example. The army turned control over to the National Park Service in 1918.

By 1915, horses were no longer allowed on park roads and almost 1,000 automobiles entered the park that year. Between 1933 and 1941, the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] built the majority of the early visitor centers, campgrounds and developed the current system of park roads. During [[World War II]], staffing and visitation both decreased and many facilities fell into disrepair.<ref name="nps"/> By the 1950's, visitation increased tremendously at most national parks. Park officials implemented [[Mission 66]], an effort to modernize and expand park service facitilites to accomodate the increased visitation. Expected to be completed by 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission 66 construction diverged from the traditional log cabin style and instead used frame construction for housing and in some parks, concrete for visitors centers and related structures.<ref name="Allaback">{{cite web| last = Allaback| first = Sarah| title = Mission 66 Visitor Centers| work = | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior| date = 2000| url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/allaback/| accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> During the late 1980's, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted back to the more traditional designs. As of 2007, some of the earliest Mission 66 structures completed at Canyon Village in 1958 are being rebuilt in the traditional style.

In 1959, a powerful [[earthquake]] just north of Yellowstone at [[Quake Lake]] damaged roads and some structures in the park and had a direct impact on geysers and hotsprings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/usa/1959_08_18.html | title = Largest Earthquake in Montana | format = | work = Large Earthquakes in the United States | publisher = U.S. Geological Survey | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> 

The [[Yellowstone Fire of 1988]] was the largest [[forest fire]] in the history of the park. Approximately 793,880&nbsp;acres (3,212&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), 36 percent of the parkland was impacted by the fires, leading to a systematic reevaluation of fire management policies. The fire season of 1988 was considered normal until a combination of drought and heat by late July of that year contributed to an extreme fire danger. In one day alone, on August 20, 1988, strong winds helped fan the flames that consumed more than 150,000&nbsp;acres (607&nbsp;km<U+00B2>).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/fire.htm | title = Wildland Fire in Yellowstone | format = | work = | publisher = National Park Service | accessdate = 2007-02-28}}</ref> 

Yellowstone was designated an [[International Biosphere Reserve]] on [[October 26]], [[1976]], and a [[United Nations]] [[World Heritage Site]] on [[September 8]], [[1978]].

==Geography==
The [[Continental Divide]] of [[North America]] runs roughly diagonally through the southwestern part of the park. The divide is a [[topography|topographic]] ridgeline that bisects the continent between [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] water drainages (the drainage from one-third of the park is on the Pacific side of this divide).   

For example, the [[Yellowstone River]] and the [[Snake River]] both have their origin close to each other in the park. However, the headwaters of the Snake River are on the west side of the continental divide, and the headwaters of the Yellowstone River are on the east side of that divide. The result is that the waters of the Snake River head toward the Pacific Ocean, and the waters of the Yellowstone head for the Atlantic Ocean (via the [[Gulf of Mexico]]).
[[Image:Continental Divide in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|thumb|300px|left|225px|The Continental Divide passes through Yellowstone.]]
The park sits on a high [[plateau]] which is, on average, 8,000&nbsp;feet (2,400&nbsp;m) above [[sea level]] and is bounded on nearly all sides by [[mountain range]]s of the [[Rocky Mountains|Middle Rocky Mountains]], which range from 10,000 to 14,000&nbsp;feet (3,000 to 4,300&nbsp;m) in elevation. These ranges are: the [[Gallatin Range]] (to the northwest), [[Beartooth Mountains]] (to the north), [[Absaroka Mountains]] (to the east), [[Wind River Range]] (southeast corner), [[Teton Mountains]] (to the south, see [[Grand Teton National Park]]) and the [[Madison Range]] (to the west). The most prominent summit in the plateau is [[Mount Washburn]] at 10,243&nbsp;feet (3,122&nbsp;m).  

Just outside of the southwestern park border is the [[Island Park Caldera]], which is a plateau ringed by low hills. Beyond that are the [[Snake River Plain]]s of southern Idaho, which are covered by [[flood basalt]]s and slope gently to the southwest (see [[Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve|Craters of the Moon National Monument]]).   

The major feature of the Yellowstone Plateau is the Yellowstone Caldera; a very large caldera which has been nearly filled-in with volcanic debris and measures 30 by 40 miles (50 by 60&nbsp;km). Within this caldera lies most of [[Yellowstone Lake]], which is the largest high-elevation lake in North America, and two [[resurgent dome]]s, which are areas that are uplifting at a slightly faster rate than the rest of the plateau.  <br clear="all">

==Geology==
{{seealso|Geothermal areas of Yellowstone}}
Yellowstone is at the northeast tip of a smooth U-shaped curve through the mountains, which is now the Snake River Plain.  This curved [[plain]] was created as the North American [[continent]] drifted across a stationary volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] beneath the [[Earth]]'s crust.  This hotspot used to be near what is now [[Boise, Idaho]], but North America has drifted at a rate of 45&nbsp;mm a year in a southwestern direction, so that the hotspot's present location is below Yellowstone.   
[[Image:Columnar basalt closeup near Tower Fall in Yellowstone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Columnar basalt near Tower Fall. Large floods of basalt and other lava types preceded mega-eruptions of superheated ash and pumice.]]
[[Yellowstone Caldera]] is the largest volcanic system in North America.  It has been termed a "[[supervolcano]]" because the caldera was formed by exceptionally large explosive eruptions. It was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000 years ago that released 1,000 [[cubic kilometer]]s of ash, rock and [[pyroclast|pyroclastic]] materials (this was 450 times larger than Mount St. Helens' 1980 eruption), forming a [[Volcanic crater|crater]] nearly a kilometre deep and 30 by 70 kilometres in area (18 by 43&nbsp;mi) (the size of the caldera has been modified a bit since this time and has mostly been filled in, however).  The [[Tuff#Welded tuff|welded tuff]] [[geologic formation]] created by this eruption is called the [[Lava Creek Tuff]]. In addition to the last great eruptive cycle there were two other previous ones in the Yellowstone area.

Each eruption is in fact a part of an eruptive cycle that climaxes with the collapse of the roof of a partially emptied [[magma chamber]]. This creates a crater, called a caldera, and releases vast amounts of volcanic material (usually through fissures that ring the caldera). The time between the last three cataclysmic eruptions in the Yellowstone area has ranged from 600,000 to 900,000 years, but the small number of such climax eruptions can not be used to make a prediction for the time range for the next climax eruption.  
[[Image:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|left|thumb|300px|An image of the [[Grand Prismatic Spring]].]]

The first and largest eruption climaxed to the southwest of the current park boundaries 2.2&nbsp;million years ago and formed a caldera about 50 by 80 kilometres in area (30 by 50&nbsp;mi) and hundreds of meters deep after releasing 2,500 cubic kilometers of material (mostly ash, [[pumice]] and other pyroclastics).  This caldera has been filled in by subsequent eruptions, and the geologic formation created by this eruption is called the [[Huckleberry Ridge Tuff]].

The second eruption, at 280 km<U+00B3> of material ejected, climaxed 1.2&nbsp;million years ago and formed the much smaller Island Park Caldera and the geologic formation called the [[Mesa Falls Tuff]]. All three climax eruptions released vast amounts of ash that blanketed much of central North America and fell many hundreds of miles away (as far as California to the southwest; see [[Lake Tecopa]]). The amount of ash and gases released into the atmosphere probably caused significant impacts to world weather patterns and led to the [[extinction]] of many species in at least North America. About 160,000 years ago a much smaller climax eruption occurred which formed a relatively small caldera that is now filled in with the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake.

[[Image:Morning Glory Pool.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Morning Glory Pool]]

Lava strata is most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. According to Ken Pierce, [[USGS|U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS) geologist, at the end of the last glacial period, about 14,000 to 18,000 years ago, [[ice dam]]s formed at the mouth of Yellowstone Lake. When the ice dams melted, a great volume of water was released downstream causing massive [[flash flood]]s and immediate and catastrophic erosion of the present-day canyon. These flash floods probably happened more than once. The canyon is a classic V-shaped [[valley]], indicative of river-type erosion rather than glaciation. Today the canyon is still being eroded by the Yellowstone River.

After the last major climax eruption 630,000 years ago until about 70,000 years ago, Yellowstone Caldera was nearly filled in with periodic eruptions of [[rhyolite|rhyolitic]] lavas (example at [[Obsidian Cliffs]]) and [[basalt]]ic lavas (example at [[Sheepeaters Cliff]]). But 150,000 years ago the floor of the plateau began to bulge up again. Two areas in particular at the foci of the elliptically shaped caldera are rising faster than the rest of the plateau. This differential in uplift has created two resurgent domes ([[Sour Creek dome]] and [[Mallard Lake dome]]) which are uplifting at 15 [[millimeter]]s a year while the rest of the caldera area of the plateau is uplifting at 12.5&nbsp;millimeters a year. A report in mid December 2006 indicates that two of Yellowstone's dome areas have been rising at an increased rate since 2004. The Mallard Lake Dome and the Sour Creek Dome have risen at a rate of 4 to 6 cm/yr since 2004.<ref>[http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2006/12/15/news/state/25-dome.txt Billings Gazette], Retrieved 4 January 2007</ref>

[[Image:Old_Faithful_Geyser_Yellowstone_National_Park.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The most famous geyser in the world, [[Old Faithful Geyser]]]]

Preserved within Yellowstone are many [[geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] features and some 10,000 hot springs and geysers, 62% of the planet's known total. The superheated water that sustains these features comes from the same hot spot described above.

The most famous geyser in the park, and perhaps the world, is [[Old Faithful Geyser]] (located in Upper Geyser Basin), but the park also contains the largest active geyser in the world, [[Steamboat Geyser]] in the Norris Geyser Basin.

In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, Yellowstone National Park, and the [[University of Utah]] created the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a partnership for long-term monitoring of the geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field. YVO maintains a website to disseminate information about research, plans, and events concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region.<ref name="yvo">{{cite web

In 2003, changes at the Norris Geyser Basin resulted in the temporary closure of some trails in the basin.  This coincided with the release of reports about a multiple year USGS research project mapping the bottom of Yellowstone Lake that identified a structural dome that had uplifted at some time in past beneath Yellowstone Lake.  On [[March 10]], [[2004]], a biologist discovered 5 dead bison which apparently had inhaled toxic geothermal gases trapped in the Norris Geyser Basin by a seasonal atmospheric inversion.  Shortly after, in April 2004, the park experienced an upsurge of earthquake activity.  These events inspired a great deal of media attention and speculation about the geologic future of the region.  The United States government responded by allocating more resources to monitor the volcano and reminding visitors to remain on designated safe trails.  The intervals between the historic large, caldera-forming explosions suggest that another such explosion may be "due," if not overdue.<br clear="all">

==Biology and ecology==
{{main|Animals of Yellowstone|Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Wolf reintroduction|Grizzly Bear}}
[[Image:Antilocapra americana.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Pronghorn are commonly found on the grasslands in the park]]
The dominant tree species in the park is [[Lodgepole pine]], however, varieties of [[spruce]], [[fir]] and [[aspen]] are also common. There are at least 600 species of trees and plants found in the park, some of which are found nowhere else.

Yellowstone is widely considered to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the [[contiguous United States|lower 48 states]]. Animals found in the park include the majestic [[American bison]] (buffalo), grizzly bear, [[American black bear|black bear]], [[wolves]], elk, [[moose]], [[mule deer]], [[pronghorn]], [[bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain lion]] (puma). Rivers in the Yellowstone drainage comprise the core range of the [[cutthroat trout]] subspecies known as [[Yellowstone cutthroat trout]], a fish highly sought by [[fishing|anglers]] yet one that has faced several threats in recent years, including the illegal intentional introduction of [[lake trout]], which consume the smaller cutthroat trout; the ongoing drought; and the accidental introduction of a parasite which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish, known as [[Myxobolus cerebralis|whirling disease]].

The relatively large bison populations that exist in the park are a concern for ranchers who fear that the bison can transmit [[bovine]] diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison have been exposed to [[brucellosis]], a [[bacterium|bacteria]]l disease that came to North America with [[Europe]]an cattle and may cause [[cattle]] to [[miscarriage|miscarry]]. The disease has little effect on park bison and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to a visitor or to domestic livestock has ever been filed. But since the possibility of contagion still exists, the State of Montana believes its "brucellosis-free" status may be jeopardized if bison are in proximity to cattle. Montana had approved a bison hunt for the fall of 2005, with 50 licenses issued to shoot bison that have left the park. Elk also carry the disease, but this popular game species is not considered a threat to livestock.
[[Image:Bison near a hot spring in Yellowstone-750px.JPG|thumb|300px|left|[[American Bison|Bison]] graze near a hot spring]]
To combat the perceived threat, National Park personnel regularly harass bison herds back into the park when they venture outside of park borders. [[Animal rights]] activists state that is a cruel practice and that the possibility for disease transmission is not as great as some ranchers maintain. Ecologists also point out that the bison are just traveling to seasonal grazing areas that lie within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem that have been converted to cattle grazing (most of these areas are also within [[United States National Forests]]).

After the wolves were extirpated from Yellowstone, the smaller cousin of the wolf, the [[coyote]], then became the park's top predator. However, the coyote is not able to bring down any large animal in the park and the result of this lack of a top predator on these populations was a marked increase in lame and sick megafauna.

Starting in 1918, in an effort to protect elk populations, the Director of the Park Service ordered <U+201C>extermination of mountain lions and other predatory animals<U+201D> in Yellowstone.  Park Service hunters carried out these orders and by 1926 they had killed 122 wolves.  By this time wolves were all but eliminated from Yellowstone.

[[Image:Yellowstone wolfmap.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map showing the ranges of wolf packs that were reintroduced into Yellowstone.]]
By the 1990s, the Federal government had reversed its views on wolves.  In a controversial decision by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (which oversees threatened and endangered species), wolves were reintroduced into the park. Before 1994 there were no wolves in Yellowstone. The wolves that were reintroduced in 1995 and 1996 thrived and there are now over 300 of their descendents living in the Greater Yellowstone Area. 

However, ranchers in surrounding areas are concerned about wolves that venture outside the park and prey on their livestock, especially [[sheep]] and cattle. For the most part, wolves kill what they were taught to kill as pups, so they tend to prey on elk rather than sheep, but once a wolf pack begins eating sheep and training the pups to eat sheep, there is little recourse but to destroy the offending pack members. Ranchers are compensated for their losses if they can prove that wolves killed the livestock, but they contend that it is often difficult to prove that the kills were not made by coyotes or wild dogs. 

Reintroduced wolf packs do not carry [[endangered species]] status, so ranchers can kill wolves that threaten their herds, but wolves relocating from Canada on their own have begun to merge with the Yellowstone population, making it difficult to discern which wolves are protected and which are not.

The National Park Service was generally not in favor of the reintroduction, citing evidence that wolves had already begun to return on their own, reestablishing themselves in very limited numbers prior to the wolf reintroduction. Wildlife biologists employed by the National Park Service had documented rare sightings made personally and from eyewitness accounts. It was a quiet concern that the compact agreed on by federal agencies and the states in which Yellowstone is located would ultimately provide less protection to the wolf, because the threatened status would be amended to appease local interests such as ranchers who would not likely face prosecution under the reintroduction agreement.

In Yellowstone's hot waters,  bacteria form mats consisting of trillions of individual bacteria. The surfaces of these mats assume bizarre shapes, and flies and other arthropods live on the mats, even in the midst of the bitterly cold winters. Scientists thought that microbes there gained sustenance only from [[sulfur]], but scientists from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] discovered in 2005 that the sustenance for some species is [[hydrogen|molecular hydrogen]], although there is evidence that this may not be the case for all of these diverse hyperthermophilic species.

[[Lake trout]] are an example of an [[invasive species]] of fish that is decimating the native [[Yellowstone cutthroat trout|cutthroat trout]] population in [[Yellowstone Lake]].

{{seealso|Yellowstone Fire of 1988}}
[[Image:Yellowstonefire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Fire in Yellowstone National Park]]
[[Image:Fires_yellowstone.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[1988]] fires affected 793,880 [[acre]]s or 36% of the park. Five [[wildfire]]s burned into the park that year from adjacent public lands. The largest, the [[North Fork Fire]], started from a discarded cigarette and burned more than 410,000 acres.]]
A series of [[lightning]]-derived [[fire]]s started to burn large portions of the park in July of the especially dry [[Yellowstone Fire of 1988|summer of 1988]].  Thousands of [[firefighter]]s responded to the blaze in order to prevent human-built structures from succumbing to the flames. Controversially, however, no serious effort was made to completely extinguish the fires, and they burned until the arrival of autumn rains.  Ecologists argue that fire is part of the Yellowstone [[ecosystem]], and that not allowing the fires to run their course (as has been the practice in the past) will result in an overgrown forest that would be extremely vulnerable to deoxygenation, disease, and decay.  In fact, relatively few [[megafauna]] in the park were killed by the fires; and since the blaze, many saplings have sprung up on their own, old vistas are viewable once again, and many previously unknown archaeological and geological sites of interest were found and cataloged by scientists.  The National Park Service now has a policy of lighting smaller, controlled "[[controlled burn|prescribed fires]]" to prevent another dangerous buildup of flammable materials.

==Tourist information== 
[[Image:YellowstoneMap.png|right|275px|Orientation map of Yellowstone National Park showing many of the major tourist attractions.]]
Yellowstone is one of the most popular national parks in the United States. The park is unique in that it features multiple natural wonders all in the same park. At peak summer levels, 3,500 employees work for Yellowstone National Park [[concessioner]]s and about 800 work for the park.

Geysers, hot springs, a grand canyon, forests, wilderness, wildlife and even a large lake can all be found inside the park. Due to the park's diversity of features, the list of activities for visitors is nearly endless. From backpacking to mountaineering, from [[kayak]]ing to fishing, from sightseeing to watching bison, moose, and elk wandering into the parking lot of the visitor centers, most visitors enjoy a memorable experience in nature.

Most of the geothermal features (hot springs, geysers, etc) emit gaseous sulfur, and though to most people the odor is not terribly offensive or overwhelming, people with respiratory difficulties should consult their doctors before visiting.

Wildfires are a relatively common occurrence in Yellowstone, because of the dry summer climate, but they should not be considered "disasters"; instead, they are a regular natural process that contributes to the beauty and ecology of the park. A series of wildfires in 1988 burned about 45% of the park's forest, including some forests adjacent to the major tourist areas. The areas burned in the 1988 fire present a strange, stark beauty, and the burned areas are swiftly returning to green.
[[Image:IMG 0302.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Old Faithful Inn.]]
Park officials advise visitors not to approach dangerous animals and to stay on designated safe trails to avoid falling into boiling liquids and inhaling toxic gas.  In 2004, five bison were discovered dead from an apparent inhalation of toxic geothermal gases. 

Lodging for visitors exist at 11 locations within park boundaries.  There is a clear view of Old Faithful Geyser at the park's [[Old Faithful Inn]]. Lodges range from hotel to cabin accommodations.  There also are 11 campgrounds and one hard-sided recreational vehicle park.
[[Image:YellowstoneBears.jpg|thumb|240px| Despite warnings from park officials visitors have often fed bears.]]
The park itself is surrounded by other protected lands (including [[Grand Teton National Park]] and [[Custer National Forest]]) and beautiful drives (such as the [[Beartooth Highway]]). Nearby communities include [[West Yellowstone, Montana]]; [[Cody, Wyoming]]; [[Red Lodge, Montana]]; [[Ashton, Idaho]]; and [[Gardiner, Montana]].<br clear=all>
