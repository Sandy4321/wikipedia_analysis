A  '''keystone''' is the architectural piece at the crown of a [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] or [[arch]] and marks its [[apex (geometry)|apex]], locking the other pieces into position. This makes a keystone very important structurally.<ref>{{cite web

Some say that a keystone is not as important structurally as the voussoirs, since the removal of any of the voussoirs would cause the arch to collapse but this is not necessarily true of the keystone.<ref>{{cite web

Old keystones can decay due to vibration, a condition known as [[bald arch]].

In a vault, keystones may mark the intersections of [[tracery]].

[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] architects of the 16th century enjoyed building an arch with a slightly dropped keystone as seen below in example at [[Colditz Castle]].
==Figurative use==
The term is used figuratively to refer to the central supporting element of a larger structure, such as a theory or an organization, without which the whole structure would collapse.<ref name="merriam"/>
Example: ''Trade is the keystone of modern civilization.''

The state of [[Pennsylvania]] is called "the keystone state" because of its central location and commercial and political importance among the colonies. The notched keystone shape is sometimes used as a logo for the state.  From this, the keystone shape became the logo of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].
