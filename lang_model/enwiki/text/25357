'''''But I'm a Cheerleader''''' is a [[1999 in film|1999]] [[satire|satirical]] [[romantic comedy]] film directed by [[Jamie Babbit]] and written by [[Brian Wayne Peterson]]. [[Natasha Lyonne]] stars as Megan Bloomfield, an apparently happily [[heterosexual]] high school [[cheerleading|cheerleader]]. Her friends and family are convinced she's gay and arrange an [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]], sending her to a [[reparative therapy]] camp to cure her [[lesbian|lesbianism]]. At camp, Megan soon realizes that she is indeed a lesbian and, despite the therapy, gradually comes to embrace this fact. The supporting cast features [[Clea DuVall]], [[Cathy Moriarty]], [[RuPaul]], [[Mink Stole]] and [[Bud Cort]].

''But I'm a Cheerleader'' was Babbit's first [[feature film]]. It was inspired by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programs. She used the story of a young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the [[social construction]] of [[gender roles]] and [[heteronormativity]]. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.

When it was initially rated as NC-17 by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]], Babbit made cuts to allow it to be re-rated as R. When interviewed in the documentary film ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with homosexual content. The film was not well received by critics who compared it unfavorably to the films of [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] and criticized the colorful production design. The lead actors were praised for their performances but some of the characters were described as [[stereotype|stereotypical]].
__TOC__

==Plot==
The film introduces seventeen-year-old Megan (Lyonne), a high school [[Twelfth grade|senior]] who loves cheerleading and is [[Courtship|going steady]] with [[American football|footballer]] boyfriend Jared. She does not enjoy kissing her boyfriend, and prefers looking at of her fellow cheerleaders. Her family and friends suspect that Megan is in fact a lesbian, and with the help of [[ex-gay]] Mike (RuPaul), surprise her with an intervention. Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative therapy camp which uses a five-step program (similar to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]' [[Twelve-step program]]) to [[Conversion therapy|convert]] its campers to heterosexuality.

At True Directions, Megan meets the founder, Mary Brown (Moriarty), Mary's son Rock and the group of young people trying to cure their homosexuality. With the prompting of Mary and the other campers, Megan agrees that she is a lesbian. This fact, at odds with her religious upbringing, distresses her and she puts every effort into becoming straight. Early on in her stay at True Directions, Megan discovers two of the boys, Dolph and Clayton, having sex. She panics and screams, leading to their discovery by Mike. Dolph is made to leave and Clayton is punished by being forced into isolation.

The True Directions program involves the campers admitting their homosexuality, rediscovering their [[gender identity]] by performing stereotypically gender-associated tasks, finding the [[root cause|root]] of their homosexuality, demystifying the opposite sex and simulating heterosexual sex. Over the course of the program, Megan becomes friends with another girl at the camp, college student Graham (DuVall). The group is encouraged to rebel against Mary by two of her former students. The [[ex-ex-gay]]s Larry and Lloyd take the campers to a local [[gay bar]] where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. When Mary discovers the outing, she makes them all [[Picketing|picket]] Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying [[placard]]s and shouting [[homophobia|homophobic]] abuse. 

Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex. When Mary finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp. Megan and Dolph, who is also living with Larry and Lloyd, plan to win back Graham and Clayton. They go to the True Directions [[graduation ceremony]] where Megan performs a cheer for Graham and tells her that she loves her. They drive off with Dolph and Clayton. The final scene of the film shows Megan's parents (Stole and Cort) attending a [[PFLAG]] meeting to come to terms with their daughter's homosexuality.

===Conception===
Babbit, whose mother runs a halfway house called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had wanted to make a comedy about rehabilitation and the 12-step program.<ref name="Out" /> After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas.<ref name="Advocate">

Not feeling qualified to write the script herself, Babbit brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] Brian Wayne Peterson.<ref name="NitrateInterview" /><ref name="Reel.com" /> Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for [[sex offender]]s.<ref name="Out" /> He has said that he wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.<ref name="Out" />

===Set and costume design===
[[Image:Cheerleader-pickets.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The True Directions campers picket the ex-ex-gays. The intense colors were intended to show the artificiality of gender construction.]]
Babbit says that her influences for the look and feel of the film included John Waters, [[David LaChapelle]], ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and [[Barbie]].<ref name="NitrateInterview" />
She wanted the production and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of [[Gender studies|gender construction]]).<ref name="NitrateInterview" /> According to Babbit, the [[Mysophobia|germaphobic]] character of Mary Brown represents [[AIDS]] paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] outfits.<ref name="NitrateInterview" /> The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink [[picket fence]] were filmed in [[Palmdale, California]].<ref name="Out" />

===Casting===
Babbit recruited Clea DuVall, who had starred in her short film ''Sleeping Beauties'' to play the role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall including Natasha Lyonne and [[Melanie Lynskey]].<ref name="AfterEllenInterview" /> Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it.<ref name="Out" /> She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short ''Sleeping Beauties'' and was eager to work with the director.<ref name="Rainbow">{{cite web

An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because she was too [[Christian]] and did not want her family to see her face on the poster.<ref name="AfterEllenInterview" /> Babbit briefly considered [[Rosario Dawson]] as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]], would not be right for the All-American character.<ref name="NitrateInterview" />

Babbit made a conscious effort to cast [[Colored|people of color]] for minor roles, in an effort to combat what she describes as "racism at every level of making movies".<ref name="NitrateInterview" /> From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph ([[Dante Basco]]) and Andre ([[Douglas Spain]]) to be [[African American]], [[Asian people|Asian]] and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered [[Arsenio Hall]] for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role.<ref name="Reel.com" /> As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].<ref>{{cite web

Gender roles are further reinforced by the tasks the campers have to perform in "Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity". Nikki Sullivan in ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'' says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than the natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality.<ref name="NS" /> Sullivan says that the film not only highlights the ways in which gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes the norms and truths about [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] society and renders them strange or "queer".<ref name="NS" /> Holmlund says that Babbit makes the straight characters less normal and less likable than the gay ones.<ref name="CH" /> Sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes ''But I'm a Cheerleader'' an exemplification of [[queer theory]].<ref name="NS" />
