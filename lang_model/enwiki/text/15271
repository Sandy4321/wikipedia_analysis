The incidents started on 15 May 1946 when two Royal Navy ships, [[HMS Orion (85)|HMS ''Orion'']] and [[HMS Superb (25)|HMS ''Superb'']], crossed the Corfu Channel following a prior inspection and clearing of the strait.<ref name="Corfu Incident"/><ref name="ABC">[http://www.historyandtheheadlines.abc-clio.com/ContentPages/ContentPage.aspx?entryId=1162021&currentSection=1130228&productid=4 ABC CLIO Schools] Corfu Channel Incident (1946) Quote: "Corfu Channel Incident (1946) Incident marking the escalation of a dispute between Albania and the United Kingdom over rights of passage through the channel that separates the Greek island of Corfu from the Albanian mainland when two British warships struck sea mines in October 1946" and "In the court's verdict of 9 April 1949, its first ever, the judges saw no sufficient evidence for the British claim that Albania was responsible for the laying of the mines, but held that because of its intensive monitoring of the channel, Albania must have been aware of the minefield and had a legal obligation to warn passing ships. Furthermore, the court ruled that the British ships had exercised their right of innocent passage, while a subsequent British mine-clearing action on 13 November 1946 (Operation Retail) required Albanian permission and was therefore illegal."</ref> While crossing they came under fire from fortifications situated on the Albanian coast.<ref name="Corfu Incident"/><ref name="Timesonline"/> Although the ships suffered no material damage and no human casualties occurred, Britain issued a formal demand for "an immediate and public apology from the Albanian Government".<ref name="Corfu Incident"/> Such apology was not forthcoming, however, and the Albanian Government claimed that the British ships had trespassed in Albanian waters.<ref name="Corfu Incident"/><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=T68DkhSaj8EC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=Corfu+Channel+Incident&source=web&ots=jK0_a7h2tx&sig=1St9-nMC2vaBFxUxjt8tlLS7eAQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result Digest of International Cases on the Law of the Sea] By Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, [[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]] Published by [[United Nations Publications]], 2007 ISBN 9211337593, 9789211337594 272 pages</ref>

[[Image:HMS Orion (85).jpg|thumb|230px|HMS ''Orion'' was one of the ships fired on in the first incident]]
The second incident was by far the most serious.<ref name="Corfu Incident"/> On 22 October 1946, a Royal Navy [[flotilla]] composed of  the [[cruiser]]s [[HMS Mauritius (80)|HMS ''Mauritius'']] and [[HMNZS Leander|HMS ''Leander'']], and the destroyers [[HMS Saumarez (G12)|HMS ''Saumarez'']] and [[HMS Volage (R41)|HMS ''Volage'']], was ordered northward through the Corfu Channel with the express orders to test the Albanian reaction to their right of [[innocent passage]].<ref name="Journal of Legal History">[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2005/3.html Australian Journal of Legal History] Half Light Between War and Peace: Herbert Vere Evatt, The Rule of International Law, and The Corfu Channel Case Quote: "This long-forgotten episode in the early days of the Cold War prompted active Australian participation in the consideration by the Security Council of the United Nations (UN) of the ensuing controversy," and "On 22 October 1946, a Royal Navy squadron comprising the cruisers, HMS Mauritius and HMS Leander, and two destroyers, HMS Saumarez and HMS Volage, was sent northward through the strait from Corfu expressly in order to test the Albanian attitude, that is to say, to see whether the ships would be allowed to pass without interference." and "The minesweeping occurred within Albanian territorial waters and within the limits of the previously swept channel. And it occurred under the cover of an aircraft carrier, cruisers and other warships." and "On 9 December 1946, the British Government sent a very detailed note to the Albanian Government narrating the relevant events that had occurred since late 1944.[17] The note demanded an apology for the unprovoked attacks of 15 May 1946 and 22 October 1946, an assurance that there would be no repetition of the Albanians' unlawful action, and reparation for the deaths, injuries, and damage caused by those attacks. The Albanians were informed that if no satisfactory reply was received within 14 days, the matter would be brought before the UN Security Council. In its response received on 21 December, Albania expressed regret for the incident which occurred on 21 October, but denied responsibility for the laying of mines. The Albanians said that the mine laying must have been the work of those who did not wish to see friendly relations re-established between the United Kingdom and Albania. The Albanian Government insinuatingly drew attention to the fact that Greek and other foreign vessels had several times entered southern territorial waters of Albania despite Albanian protests. IV THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL DISAPPOINTS The United Kingdom, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, viewed the Albanian stance as totally unsatisfactory" also "Nevertheless, the Court<U+2019>s answer to the first question attributing legal responsibility to Albania was justified by the evidence of Albania<U+2019>s admitted constant vigilance over the North Corfu Channel after May 1946, of the Albanian order to fire on the Orion and Superb, of Albania<U+2019>s repeated demands that permission for passage was required, of Albania<U+2019>s failure to protest in its notifications to the UN Secretary General about the laying of a minefield, of its failure to notify the presence of mines in its waters at the latest after the sweep carried out on 13 November 1946, and of its failure to investigate the events of 22 October 1946. In addition, their geographical configuration were such that the Bay of Saranda and the channel used by shipping through the Strait were easily watched, the minelaying operation required a certain minimum lapse of time, and visibility and sound tests were conducted which had led experts to the conclusion that it was indisputable that if a normal look-out was kept at specified locations the minelaying operations must have been noticed by coastguards" and " However, the Cold War was ending. Discussions between the UK and Albania took place in December 1990 leading to the resumption of diplomatic relations. The People<U+2019>s Socialist Republic of Albania came to an end in 1991. Then, on 8 May 1992, the parties to the Corfu Channel case announced that they had settled their differences. In a joint announcement, <U+2018>Both sides expressed their regret at the Corfu Channel Incident of 22 October 1946<U+2019>."</ref><ref name="ABC"/><ref name="ICJ">[http://www.iilj.org/courses/documents/CorfuChannel.pdf Institute for International Law and Justice:] CORFU CHANNEL CASE (MERITS) [ICJ] Judgment of 9 April 1949 Quote: "An incident had already occurred in these waters on May 15, 1946: an Albanian battery had fired in the direction of two British cruisers. The United Kingdom Government had protested, stating that innocent passage through straits is a right recognized by international law; the Albanian Government had replied that foreign warships and merchant vessels had no right to pass through Albanian territorial waters without prior authorization;" and "From all the facts and observations mentioned above, the Court draws the conclusion that the laying of the minefield could not have been accomplished without the knowledge of Albania. As regards the obligations resulting for her from this knowledge, they are not disputed. It was her duty to notify shipping and especially to warn the ships proceeding through the Strait on October 22nd of the danger to which they were exposed. In fact, nothing was attempted by Albania to prevent the disaster, and these grave omissions involve her international responsibility."</ref> The crews were instructed to respond if attacked.<ref name="Journal of Legal History"/> 

They were passing close to the Albanian coast in what they considered to be a [[Naval mine|mine]]-free zone with ''Mauritius'' leading and ''Saumarez'' following closely.

The third and final incident occurred on 12 November &ndash; 13 November 1946 when the Royal Navy carried out an additional mine sweeping operation in the Corfu channel, codenamed ''Operation Retail''.<ref name="Corfu Incident"/><ref name="ABC"/><ref name="Operation Retail">[http://books.google.com/books?id=H1qymW-ArcEC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=operation+RETAIL+Corfu+Channel&source=web&ots=qwPTP0kj6d&sig=_sIjL7wkuCXKMZe-VowEts6I5OE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result The Law and Organisation of International Commodity Agreements] By Kabir-ur-Rahman Khan Published by BRILL, 1982 ISBN 9024725542, ISBN 9789024725540 416 pages By Google  Books Quote: "In the Corfu Channel Case the World Court had to decide whether the "Operation Retail" launched by the United Kingdom was compatible with the right of innocent passage in the International strait of Corfu Channel" and "The operation was launched with the object of securing ''corpora delicti'', namely the mines, and was justified as an act of self-help or self-protection" </ref> Under the direction of the ''Allied Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean'' the mine-sweeping operation took place within Albanian [[territorial waters]], but without authorisation by the Albanian government, and had the additional purpose of using the mines as ''[[Corpus delicti|corpora delicti]]'' to prove that the British were acting in [[self defence]] by attempting to clear hazards to navigation.<ref name="Journal of Legal History"/><ref name="Operation Retail"/>  

There was also present a [[French people|French]] [[naval officer]] who, at the invitation of the ''Mediterranean Zone Board'', acted as an observer. An [[aircraft carrier]], cruisers and other [[warship]]s provided cover. Twenty-two ''contact mines'' were discovered and cut from their undersea moorings. The placement of the mines  was such that the minefield was deemed to have been deliberately designed and not simply a random aggregation of isolated mines. Two of the cut mines were sent to [[Malta]] for further examination. It was then discovered that the mines were of [[Nazi Germany|German]] origin but they were free of rust and marine growth. They were also freshly painted and their mooring cables were recently lubricated. It was concluded that the minefield was laid shortly before the incident involving ''Saumarez'' and ''Volage''. Mine fragment analysis from the ''Volage'' confirmed the mines were similar to the ones at Malta.<ref name="Journal of Legal History"/> 

Following the third incident, Albania, under [[prime minister]] [[Enver Hoxha]], dispatched a [[telegram]] to the [[United Nations]] complaining about an incursion by the Royal Navy into Albanian coastal waters.<ref name="Corfu Incident"/><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=lw86IpC5eZAC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=Corfu+Channel+Incident&source=web&ots=_6W4aUI36f&sig=aXp3OGP32N3yr7AYcxZFeaj2uqE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result Straits Used for International Navigation]: A Spanish Perspective By Jos<U+00E9> Antonio de Yturriaga Published by Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1991 ISBN 0792311418, 9780792311416 372 pages</ref>

== Aftermath ==
On 9 December 1946 Britain sent a note to the Albanian government accusing Albania of laying the mines and demanding reparations for the May and October incidents.  Britain demanded a reply within fourteen days, mentioning that in the event of a negative Albanian response the matter would be referred to the [[UN Security Council]]. The Albanian government in its reply, which was received by the British on 21 December 1946, denied the British allegations and went on to elaborate that the whole affair was the work of countries which did not wish to see a normalisation of relations between Albania and Britain, and in fact vessels from [[Greece]] and other countries had trespassed recently in the area where the mines were discovered.<ref name="Journal of Legal History"/>
