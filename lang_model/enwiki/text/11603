'''Lawrence Julius Taylor''' (born February 4, 1959), nicknamed '''"L.T."''', is a [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] former [[American football]] player. Taylor played his entire professional career as a [[linebacker]] for the [[New York Giants]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He is considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of football, and has been ranked as the top defensive player in league history by former players, coaches, media members, and news outlets such as the [[NFL Network]], and ''[[Sporting News]]''.<ref name="espn"/><ref name="Bob"/><ref name="goat"/>

After an [[All-America]]n career at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] (UNC) (1978<U+2013>1981), Taylor was drafted by the Giants as the second overall selection in the [[1981 NFL Draft]]. Although controversy surrounded the selection due to Taylor's contract demands, the two sides quickly resolved the issue. Taylor won several defensive awards after his rookie season. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Taylor was a disruptive force at [[outside linebacker]], and is credited with having changed the [[pass rush]]ing schemes, [[offensive line]] play, and [[offensive formations]] used in the NFL. Taylor produced double-digit [[Quarterback sack|sacks]] each season from 1984 through 1990, including a career high of 20.5 in 1986. He also won a record three [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]] awards and was named the league's [[NFL MVP|Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) for his performance during the 1986 season. He was named First-team All-Pro in each of his first nine seasons and was a key member of the Giants' defense, nicknamed "The [[Big Blue Wrecking Crew]]", that led New York to victories in [[Super Bowl XXI]] and [[Super Bowl XXV|XXV]]. During the 1980s Taylor, DE Leonard Marshall, and fellow linebackers [[Carl Banks]], [[Gary Reasons]], and Hall of Famer [[Harry Carson]] gave the Giants linebacking corps and overall defense a reputation as one of the best in the NFL. 

Taylor had a controversial lifestyle, during and after his playing career. He admitted to using addictive drugs such as [[cocaine]] as early as his second year in the NFL, and was suspended several times by the league for failing [[drug test]]s. His drug abuse escalated after his retirement, and he was jailed three times for attempted drug possession. From 1998 to 2009, Taylor lived a sober, drug-free life. He worked as a [[color commentator]] on sporting events for several years after his retirement and, as of 2009, was pursuing a career as an actor. His personal life came up again in a negative fashion in 2010 when he was charged with the statutory rape of a 16-year old prostitute.

==Early life==

Lawrence Taylor was the middle of three sons born to Clarence and Iris Taylor in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]. His father worked as a [[dispatcher]] at the Newport News [[shipyards]], while his mother was a schoolteacher.<ref name="ethnicity">Harris, Nolte, and Kirsch. pg.449</ref> Referred to as Lonnie by his family,<ref name="Lonnie"/> Taylor was a mischievous youth. His mother recalls, "[h]e was a challenging child. Where the other two boys would ask for permission to do stuff, Lonnie...would just do it, and when you found out about it, he would give you a big story."<ref name="Lonnie">Taylor and Serby. pg. 5</ref> Taylor concentrated on baseball as a youth, in which he played the position of [[catcher]],<ref>Taylor and Falkner. pg.7</ref> and only began playing football at the advanced age of fifteen.<ref name="ethnicity"/> He did not play organized high school football until the following year ([[eleventh grade]]),<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002947/Lawrence-Taylor Lawrence Taylor], [[britannica.com]], accessed March 29, 2007.</ref> and was not heavily [[recruiting (athletics)|recruited]] coming out of high school.<ref>Taylor and Serby. pg. 17</ref>

After graduating from [[Lafayette High School (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Lafayette High School]] in 1977,<ref>Shampoe. pg. 65</ref> Taylor attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a team captain,<ref>[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/unc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/alltimelettermen.pdf North Carolina Football All-Time Letterman] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]), [[cstv.com]], accessed February 26, 2007.</ref> and wore #98.

His awards included [[All-America]] and [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] Player of the Year honors in 1980.<ref name="ethnicity"/> While there the coaching staff marveled at his intense, reckless style of play. "As a freshman playing on special teams, he'd jump a good six or seven feet in the air to block a punt, then land on the back of his neck," said North Carolina assistant coach Bobby Cale. "He was reckless, just reckless."<ref name="espn"/> UNC later retired Taylor's jersey and after his career at UNC ended it became common for subsequent players to be measured against Taylor.<ref>[[Knight Ridder]].

==NFL career==
===1981 NFL Draft and training camp===

In the [[1981 NFL Draft]], Taylor was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] by the NFL's New York Giants as the 2nd pick overall. In a poll of NFL [[General Manager]]s (GMs) taken before the draft 26 out of the 28 GMs stated that if they had the first selection they would select Taylor.<ref name="Bob">Sansevere, Bob. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5505815_ITM Giants' L.T.: His mean streaks revolutionized NFL, made him the best.], Knight Ridder, January 8, 1994, available at [[AccessMyLibrary|accessmylibrary.com]], accessed February 17, 2007.</ref> One of the two GMs who stated that they would not take Taylor was the GM of the [[New Orleans Saints]], who had the first pick in the draft.<ref name="Bob"/> Giants General Manager [[George Young (football executive)|George Young]] was one of the many who saw Taylor's potential and predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as [[Dick Butkus]]: "Taylor is the best college linebacker I've ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There's no doubt in my mind about Taylor. He's bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the [[blitz (American football)|blitz]], he's devastating."<ref name="Bob"/> Before the draft controversy arose when Taylor and his agent Mike Trope expressed a desire to sign a contract for $250,000 [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] per season, an amount unheard of for a rookie in 1981.<ref name="walkout">Associated Press.

Despite the controversy, and to the raucous approval of the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York City), the Giants selected Taylor.<ref name="DA">[[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Anderson, Dave]].

Taylor's talent was evident from the start of [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]].

===Early career: 1981&ndash;1985===
Taylor's NFL regular season debut occurred on September 6, 1981 in a 24<U+2013>10 loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The game was non-noteworthy for Taylor except for his receiving a [[American football#Penalties|penalty]] for a late hit on Eagles running back [[Perry Harrington]].<ref name="yellowflag"/> He went on to finish his rookie season with 9.5 sacks,<ref name="hof">[http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=212 Lawrence Taylor bio], profootballhof.com, accessed February 2, 2007.</ref> and is often considered to have had one of the greatest rookie seasons in NFL history.<ref name="ROY">Merron, Jeff.

Walsh assigned [[offensive guard|guard]] [[John Ayers]], the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal.<ref name="Johnson">Johnson, Roy S.

The 1982 season was shortened by a players [[strike action|strike]]. The season included one of the more memorable plays of Taylor's career. In the nationally televised Thanksgiving Day game against the [[Detroit Lions]] the teams were tied 6&ndash;6 early in the fourth quarter, when the Lions drove deep into New York territory. Lions quarterback [[Gary Danielson]] dropped back to pass and threw the ball out to his left toward the sidelines. Taylor ran in front of the intended receiver, intercepted the pass, and returned it 97 yards for a touchdown.<ref>Rappoport, Ken[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cK9QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-M8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=5769,2441965&dq=thanksgiving+lions+lawrence-taylor&hl=en Last word on Young's comments], Associated Press. reprinted in ''[[Daily Times]]'',  November 26, 1982, accessed November 17, 2010.</ref> Taylor again won the Associated Press's Defensive Player of the Year Award.<ref name="dbf">[http://www.databasefootball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=TAYLOLAW01 Lawrence Taylor], databasefootball.com, accessed February 20, 2007.</ref> The Giants finished 4-5 and out of the playoffs.<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nyg/1982.htm 1982 New York Giants], football-reference.com, accessed November 18, 2010.</ref>

After the 1982 season, Perkins became head coach of the [[University of Alabama]] and the Giants hired [[Bill Parcells]] from within to replace him. Parcells had been the team's defensive coordinator, and in the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Taylor. Leading up to the [[1983 NFL season|1983 season]], Taylor engaged in a training camp holdout that lasted three weeks and ended with Taylor coming back to the team under his old contract with three games remaining in the preseason.<ref>Janofsky, Michael. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F60B1FF6345D0C708DDDA10894DB484D81 Taylor ends holdout], ''The New York Times'', August 13, 1983, accessed February 17, 2007.</ref>

Although Taylor recorded nine sacks and made the All-Pro team for the third consecutive season in 1983,<ref name="hof"/> the Giants struggled. The team finished 3<U+2013>12<U+2013>1,<ref name="1983NYG">[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&yr=1983&lg=nfl 1983 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed February 20, 2007.</ref> and Parcells received heavy criticism during the season from both the fans and the media. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the [[New Jersey Generals]] of the [[United States Football League]].<ref name="eske">Eskenazi, Gerald. [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F10816FA355C0C7B8DDDA80894DC484D81 Taylor buys out Generals' pact], ''The New York Times'', January 18, 1984, accessed February 17, 2007.</ref> Taylor had been given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner [[Donald Trump]] on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988.<ref name="eske"/> Taylor quickly regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to get out of the agreement. The Giants negotiated with Trump to free Taylor from the deal. The results of these negotiations included many considerations but the main result was threefold: 1) Taylor had to return the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants were required to pay Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons to release Taylor's rights, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.<ref name="eske"/><ref>Eskenazi, Gerald. pg. 46. <U+2014> Trump later stated that in the event of the USFL folding (which occurred in 1985), he would have held on to Taylor's rights to employment: "I'd put him in a doorman's uniform and have him work at one of my buildings." (ibid)</ref>

The Giants' record rebounded to 9<U+2013>7 in 1984,<ref name="1984NYG">[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&lg=nfl&yr=1984 1984 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed February 20, 2007.</ref> and Taylor had another All-Pro season.<ref name="hof"/> He got off to an quick start to the season, recording four sacks in a September game. In the playoffs the Giants defeated the [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] 16<U+2013>13, but lost 21<U+2013>10 to the eventual champion 49ers.<ref>[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&lg=NFL&yr=1984 1984 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed February 18, 2007.</ref>

In contrast to the previous season the Giants headed into the [[1985 NFL season|1985 season]] with a sense of optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5<U+2013>0 pre-season record in 1985.<ref name="5-0">Litsky, Frank.

One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback [[Joe Theismann]] inadvertently resulted in a [[bone fracture|compound fracture]] of Theismann's right leg. Immediately after the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for [[paramedics]] to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor claims he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During the first round of the playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17<U+2013>3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21<U+2013>0.<ref name="1985NYG">[http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NYG&lg=nfl&yr=1985 1985 New York Giants], databasefootball.com, accessed February 18, 2007.</ref>

===Mid-career and championships: 1986<U+2013>1990===
In 1986 Taylor had one of the most successful seasons by a defensive player in the history of the NFL. He recorded a league-leading 20.5 sacks and (at the time) became one of just two defensive players to win the NFL [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] award ([[Alan Page]] was the other) and the only defensive player to be the unanimous selection for MVP.<ref name="'L.T.'">[[Nick Charles|Charles, Nick]].

With the Super Bowl win, Taylor had just capped off an unprecedented start to his career. Six years into his career Taylor had won the [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award]] (1981), the [[NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award]] a record three times (1981, 1982, 1986), been named to First-team All-Pro each year,<ref name="hof"/> became the first defensive player in NFL history to be unanimously voted the league's MVP (1986), and led his team to a championship (1986).

The Giants appeared to have a bright future coming off their 1986 championship season as they were one of the younger teams in the league.

It became the first season in his career that he did not make the Pro Bowl, after setting a then record by making it his first ten years in the league. Taylor finished with 7 sacks in 14 games<ref name="dbf"/> and the Giants defense, while still respectable, was no longer one of the top units in the league.

Taylor returned for the [[1993 NFL season|1993 season]] enticed by the chance to play with a new coach (the newly hired [[Dan Reeves]]), and determined not to end his career due to injury.

Taylor announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, "I think it's time for me to retire. I've done everything I can do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs. I've done things that other people haven't been able to do in this game before. After 13 years, it's time for me to go."<ref>Anderson, Dave.

By the time Taylor retired, he had amassed 1,088 tackles, 132.5 sacks (not counting the 9.5 sacks he recorded as a rookie because sacks did not become an official statistic until 1982), 9 interceptions, 134 return yards, 2 touchdowns, 33 forced fumbles, 11 fumble recoveries, and 34 fumble return yards.<ref name="hof"/>

Although Taylor made adjustments to his game to remain dominant, it soon became common in the NFL for offensive linemen to pick up blitzing linebackers.

In contrast to his success on the football field, Taylor's personal life has been marred by drug usage and controversy. When Taylor was once asked what he could do that no outside linebacker could, his answer was, "Drink".<ref name="espn"/> However, alcohol abuse was not the largest of his substance abuse problems. After admitting to and testing positive for cocaine in 1987, he was suspended from football for 30 days in 1988 after failing a second drug test.

In a November 2003 interview with [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] on the television [[news magazine]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Taylor claimed he hired and sent [[prostitution|prostitutes]] to opponents' hotel rooms the night before a game in an attempt to tire them out,<ref name="cbs"/> and that at his peak, he spent thousands of dollars a day on narcotics.<ref name="cbs"/> During the interview he also recounted several other instances of his hard-partying lifestyle during his years in the NFL, including an episode when he arrived to a team meeting in handcuffs after a night spent with some [[call girls]]. Taylor stated, "A couple of ladies that were trying out some new equipment they had. You know? And I just happened to, and they just didn't happen to have the key.<U+201D><ref name="cbs"/> He also recounted that to beat NFL drug tests he routinely submitted the urine of his teammates.<ref name="cbs"/>

==Post-NFL life==
In Taylor's final year in the NFL (1993) he started a company called All-Pro Products. The company [[went public]] at $5 a share, which tripled in value during the first month of its existence. The stock price went up to $16.50 a share, at which point Taylor's stake had an estimated value of more than $10 million.<ref name="Norris">Norris, Floyd.

T.], ''The New York Times'', September 5, 1995, accessed March 23, 2008.</ref>

Taylor pursued a career in acting, appearing in the [[Oliver Stone]] movie, ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' where he played a character very much like himself. He also appeared as himself in both the [[HBO]] series ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and the film ''[[The Waterboy]]''. Taylor later appeared with [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Richard Roundtree]], [[Christian Bale]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], [[Vanessa L. Williams]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Mekhi Phifer]] and [[Busta Rhymes]] in the [[Shaft (2000 film)|2000 version of ''Shaft'']]. Taylor also added his voice to the [[video game]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', playing the steroid-riddled, possibly insane former football player B.J. Smith, a character that poked fun at his fearsome, drug-fueled public image. He also added his voice to the video game ''[[Blitz: The League]]'', which was partially based on his life in the NFL.<ref>Thomas, Vincent. He also starred in a prison movie with Jean Claude van Dam.

In 1999, when Taylor became eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, there were some concerns that his hard-partying lifestyle and drug abuse would hurt his candidacy.<ref name="hall?">[http://media.cnnsi.com/football/nfl/news/1999/01/30/halloffame_voting/ LT gets the OK], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, January 30, 1999, accessed May 3, 2007.</ref> These concerns proved to be ill-founded, however, as he was voted in on the first ballot. His son Lawrence Taylor Jr. gave his introduction speech at the induction ceremony.<ref name="induct">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/1999/08/07/halloffame_ceremony_ap/ Five for the ages: Pro Football Hall of Fame inducts five more members], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, accessed February 17, 2007.</ref> Taylor's ex-wife, his three children, and his parents were in attendance and during his induction speech Taylor acknowledged them saying, "[t]hank you for putting up with me for all those years."<ref name="induct"/> He also credited former Giants owner [[Wellington Mara]] for being supportive of him saying, "[h]e probably cared more about me as a person than he really should have."<ref name="induct"/>

Taylor is currently married to his third wife.<ref name="Losing himself">Anderson, Dave.

Taylor often speaks of his playing career, which he played with reckless abandon, and the drug-abusing stages of his life as the "L.T." periods of his life.<ref name="Losing himself"/> Taylor described "L.T." as an adrenaline junkie who lived life on a thrill ride.<ref name="Losing himself"/> Taylor commented in 2003 that "L. T. died a long time ago, and I don't miss him at all...all that's left is Lawrence Taylor."<ref name="Losing himself"/> 

Taylor again re-emerged into the public eye in July 2006 , appearing on the cover of a ''Sports Illustrated'' issue dedicated to former athletes and sport figures. In the magazine Taylor claimed his hobby of [[golf]] with helping him get over his previous hard-partying ways and drug filled lifestyle.<ref>''Sports Illustrated''. Volume 105, issue 1.
