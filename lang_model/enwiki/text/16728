'''Salvatore "Tot<U+00F2>" Riina''' (born 16 November 1930) is a member of the [[Cosa Nostra|Sicilian Mafia]] who became the most powerful member of the criminal organization in the early 1980s. Fellow mobsters nicknamed him '''The Beast''' ({{lang|scn|''La Belva''}}) due to his violent nature, or sometimes '''The Short One''' ({{lang|scn|''U curtu''}}) due to his diminutive stature. During his lifelong career in crime he is believed to have personally killed around forty people and to have ordered the deaths of several hundreds more. 

During the 1980s and early 1990s Riina and his Mafia faction, the [[Corleonesi]], waged a ruthless campaign of violence against both rival mobsters and the state, which culminated in the [[assassination]] of the anti-Mafia prosecutors [[Giovanni Falcone]] and [[Paolo Borsellino]]. This caused widespread public revulsion against the Mafia and led to a major crackdown by the authorities, resulting in the capture and imprisonment of Riina and many of his associates.

==Rise to power==
Riina was born and raised in [[Corleone]]<ref>The town chosen by [[Mario Puzo]] for the birthplace of his fictional mafia don Vito Corleone.  Coincidentally, one set of [[Al Pacino]]'s grandparents also hailed from Corleone. Source: [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s commentary for [[The Godfather]].</ref> and joined the local Mafia clan at the age of nineteen by committing a murder on their behalf. The following year he killed a man during an argument and served six years in prison for [[manslaughter]].
[[File:Salvatore Riina ID Card.jpg|thumb|left|Salvatore Riina's ID Card from 1955. His height is listed as 1.58 m (5-ft-2), hence his nickname ''The Short One''.]]

The head of the Mafia Family in Corleone was [[Michele Navarra]] until 1958, when he was shot to death on the orders of [[Luciano Leggio]], a ruthless 33-year-old Mafioso, who subsequently became the new [[crime boss|boss]]. Together with Tot<U+00F2> Riina and [[Bernardo Provenzano]] (who were two of the gunmen in Navarra's slaying), Leggio began to increase the power of the [[Corleonesi]]. Because they hailed from a relatively small town, the Corleonesi were not a major factor in the Sicilian Mafia in the 1950s, compared to the major Families based in the capital, [[Palermo]]. In a gross underestimation of the mobsters from Corleone, the Palermo bosses often referred to the Corleonesi as ''i viddani'' <U+2013> "the peasants". 

In the early 1960s, Leggio, Riina and Provenzano, who had spent the last few years hunting down and killing dozens of Navarra's surviving supporters, were forced to go into hiding due to arrest warrants. Riina and Leggio were arrested and [[Trial of the 114#Corleonisi Trial|tried in 1969]] for murders carried out earlier that decade. They were acquitted due to intimidation of the [[jurors]] and witnesses. Riina went into hiding later that year after he was indicted on a further murder charge and was to remain a fugitive for the next twenty-three years.

In 1974 Luciano Leggio was arrested and imprisoned for the murder of Michele Navarra sixteen years earlier. Although Leggio retained some influence from behind bars, Riina was now the effective head of the Corleonesi. He also had close relations with the [['Ndrangheta]], the mafia-type association in [[Calabria]]. His "compare d<U+2019>anello" (a kind of best man and trusted friend) at his wedding in 1974 was [[Domenico Tripodo]], a powerful boss and prolific cigarette smuggler.<ref name=ciconte>{{it icon}} [http://www.poliziaedemocrazia.it/live/index.php?domain=rubriche&action=articolo&idArticolo=1589 E ora la <U+2019>ndrangheta supera cosa nostra: Intervista a Enzo Ciconte], Polizia e democrazia, November<U+2013>December 2007</ref>

During the 1970s Sicily became an important location in the international [[heroin]] trade, especially with regards to the refining and exporting of the [[narcotic]]. The profits to be had from heroin were vast and exceeded those of the traditional activities of extortion and loan-sharking. Tot<U+00F2> Riina wanted to take control of the trade and was to do so by planning a war against the rival Mafia Families.

During the late 1970s, Riina orchestrated the murders of a number of high-profile public officials, such as [[judge]]s, [[prosecutors]] and members of the [[Carabinieri]]. As well as intimidating the state, these assassinations also helped to frame the Corleonesi's rivals. The Godfathers of many Mafia Families were often highly visible in their communities, rubbing shoulders with [[politicians]] and [[mayors]], protecting themselves with [[bribes]] rather than violence. In contrast, Riina, Provenzano and other Corleonesi were fugitives, always in hiding and rarely seen by other mobsters, let alone the public. Consequently, when a policeman or judge was killed it was the more visible Mafia Families who were the subject of official investigations, especially as these assassinations were deliberately carried out in the territory (or 'turf') of the Corleonesi's rivals rather than anywhere near the town of Corleone itself.

==The Mafia War of 1981 to 1983==<!-- This section is linked from [[1960s Sicilian Mafia trials]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->

{{main|Second Mafia War}}

The Corleonesi's primary rivals were [[Stefano Bontade]], [[Salvatore Inzerillo]] and [[Gaetano Badalamenti]], bosses of various powerful Palermo Mafia Families. Between 1981 and 1983, Bontade and Inzerillo, together with many associates and members of both their Mafia and blood families, were killed. There were up to a thousand killings during this time period as Riina and the Corleonesi, together with their allies, wiped out their rivals.

By 1983, the Corleonesi were effectively ruling the Mafia, and over the next few years Riina increased his influence by eliminating the Corleonesi's allies, such as [[Filippo Marchese]], [[Giuseppe Greco]] and [[Rosario Riccobono]].

While that helped them become the most powerful clan in Sicily, the Corleonesi's tactics backfired to some degree when, in 1983, a convicted double-killer named [[Tommaso Buscetta]] became the first Sicilian Mafioso to become an informant (to repent; become a ''[[pentiti|pentito]]''), and cooperate with the authorities. Buscetta was from a losing family in the Mafia war and had lost several relatives and many friends to Riina's hitmen; becoming an informant was the only way both to save himself and get his revenge on Riina. Buscetta provided a great deal of information to Judge [[Giovanni Falcone]] and he testified at the [[Maxi Trial]] in the mid 1980s that saw hundreds of Mafiosi imprisoned. Riina picked up another life sentence for murder at the Maxi Trial, but it was another ''in absentia'' sentence as he was still a fugitive.

In 1989 Riina arranged the murders of a number of his allies, including [[Ciaculli]] boss [[Vincenzo Puccio]] and Puccio's two brothers. Apparently Vincenzo Puccio had been planning to overthrow Riina as head of the Sicilian Mafia but the Corleonesi boss had found out about the plot.

==Allegations of political influence==
Riina's tenure as 'boss of bosses' was marked by a changing public attitudes to organised crime. Traditionally Sicilians did not acknowledge the existence of the Mafia as a coherent organised group, assertions to the contrary by other Italians were often seen as 'attacks from the north'. Previous bosses of the Sicilian Mafia were based in Palermo and kept violence to a minimum. Their control of large numbers of votes enabled mutually beneficial relationships with local political figures such as mayors of Palermo, [[Vito Ciancimino]] and [[Salvatore Lima]]. Ciancimino, who was born in Corleone, corruptly allowed untrammelled property development on a famous valley known as "''La Conca d'oro''" (the Golden Shell),<ref>[http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conca_d'Oro Italian WP Conca d'Oro]</ref> amassing a vast fortune in the process. Lima granted a valuable monopoly concession on tax collection to mafioso businessman [[Antonio Salvo|Ignazio Salvo]], and was instrumental in Rome based [[Giulio Andreotti]] becoming a force in national politics. In his turn Salvo acted as financier to Andreotti.<ref>Follain, J., Vendetta, 2012</ref> Italy<U+2019>s highest court, the [[Corte di Cassazione|Court of Cassation]], ruled in October 2004 that Andreotti had "friendly and even direct ties" with [[Stefano Bontade]] and [[Gaetano Badalamenti]], bosses in the so-called moderate wing of Cosa Nostra that Riina had supplanted in the [[Second Mafia War]].

These connections caused some to suspect that Riina had forged similar links to [[Giulio Andreotti]], however the courts acquitted Androtti of associations with the Mafia after 1980 <ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/kiss-of-honour-between-andreotti-and-mafia-head-never-happened-say-judges-588011.html 'Kiss of honour' between Andreotti and Mafia head never happened], The Independent, Jul 26, 2003</ref> [[Baldassare Di Maggio]] alleged that Riina met with the former Prime Minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] and greeted him with a <U+201C>kiss of honour<U+201D><ref name=stille392>Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', p. 392</ref><ref name=nyt210493>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D7163DF932A15757C0A965958260 Andreotti and Mafia: A Kiss Related], The New York Times, April 21, 1993</ref><ref name=andreotti>{{it icon}} [http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/wordtheque/it/AAAALF.TXT Le dichiarazioni di Baldassare Di Maggio], in Sentenza Andreotti</ref> Andreotti dismissed the charges against him as <U+201C>lies and slander <U+2026> the kiss of Riina, mafia summits <U+2026> scenes out of a comic horror film.<U+201D><ref name=stille392/> Veteran journalist [[Indro Montanelli]] doubted the claim, saying Andreotti "doesn't even kiss his own children."<ref name=time030696>[http://web.archive.org/web/20000817064030/http://www.time.com/time/international/1996/960603/mafia.html Heat on the Mob], Time Magazine, June 3, 1996</ref> Di Maggio's credibility had been shaken in the closing weeks of the Andreotti trial when he admitted killing a man while under state protection.<ref name=rep041099>{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/dimaggio/dimaggio/dimaggio.html La confessione di Balduccio: "Ho ucciso anche da pentito"], La Repubblica, October 4, 1999</ref>

==Strategy of violence==
[[Image:La Torre omicidio.jpg|thumb|The bodies of Pio La Torre and Rosario Di Salvo after they have been killed by the Mafia]]
Whereas his predecessors had kept a low profile that caused some in law enforcement to question the very existence of the Mafia, Riina ordered the murders of judges, policemen and prosecutors in an attempt to terrify the authorities. A law to create a new offence of Mafia conspiracy, and confiscate Mafia assets was introduced by [[Pio La Torre]] but it had been stalled in parliament for two years, La Torre was murdered April 30, 1982. In May 1982, the Italian government sent [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]], a general of the Italian [[Carabinieri]], to Sicily with orders to crush the Mafia. However, not long after arriving, on 3 September 1982, the General was gunned down in the city centre with his wife.  In response to public disquiet about the failure to effectively combat the organisation Riina headed,  [[Pio La Torre]]'s law was passed 10 days later.<ref name="Inside The Mafia">[http://www.1channel.ch/watch-757991-National-Geographic-Inside-The-Mafia Inside The Mafia], National Geographic Channel, June 2005.</ref><ref name=nyt210493/>
 
Using the new laws investigating magistrates of the [[Antimafia Pool]] including [[Giovanni Falcone]] and his colleague [[Paolo Borsellino]] were able to secure convictions against Riina and 360 mafiosi at the [[Maxi Trial]]. This was a blow to Riina as, although he was already a fugitive, he aspired to someday enjoy his vast wealth living openly as a free man. Riina pinned his hopes on the lengthy appeal process that had frequently set convicted mafioso free, and he suspended the campaign of murders against officials while the cases went to higher courts.  The convictions were upheld by the Supreme Court in January 1992. The council of top bosses headed by Riina reacted by ordering the assassination of Salvatore Lima (on the grounds that he was an ally of Giulio Andreotti), and Falcone. Lima was killed on March 12, 1992

[[Image:capaci massacre.jpg|thumb|The aftermath of the bomb attack that killed [[Giovanni Falcone]], his wife and three [[bodyguard]]s]]
Investigating magistrates, [[Giovanni Falcone]] and his colleague [[Paolo Borsellino]]'s prosecutions against the Mafia had meant they were under the constant threat of death. Both saw the murder of Lima as an indication they would be killed. 

On 23 May 1992, Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards were killed by a [[bomb]] planted under the [[highway]] outside of Palermo. A few weeks later Borsellino and five of his bodyguards were killed by a [[car bomb]]. Both attacks were ordered by Riina and carried out by his many assassins. Ignazio Salvo, who had advised Riina against killing Falcone, was himself murdered on September 17. The public were outraged, both at the Mafia and also the politicians who they felt had failed to adequately protect Falcone and Borsellino. The [[Italy|Italian]] government arranged for a massive crackdown of the Mafia in response.

==Claims of negotiations with the government==
[[Giovanni Brusca]] later claimed that Riina had told him that after the assassination of Falcone, Riina had been in negotiations with interior minister [[Nicola Mancino]] on a deal to prevent any further killings. Mancino later said this was not true,<ref>Folain, ''Vendetta'', p. 150</ref> In July 2012, Mancino was ordered to stand trial for withholding evidence on 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia, and the killings of Falcone and Borsellino.<ref name=adn250712>[http://www.adnkronos.com/IGN/Aki/English/Politics/Italy-Ex-interior-minister-implicated-in-mafia-negotiations_313538879018.html Italy: Ex-interior minister implicated in mafia negotiations], AND Kronos International, July 25, 2012</ref> Some prosecutors have theorized that Borsellino's murder was connected to the negotiations.<ref>Follain, ''Vendetta'', p. p187</ref> Carabinieri Colonel Mario Mori was involved in secret meetings with [[Vito Ciancimino]], who was close to Riina's lieutenant [[Bernardo Provenzano]]. Mori was later investigated on suspicion of posing a danger to the state after it was alleged he prevented the arrest of Provenzano and had taken a list of Riina's demands that Ciancimino had passed on. Mori maintained there had been no list, he had spoken to Ciancimino to further investigation of the Mafia, that Ciancimino had disclosed little beyond implicitly admitting he knew Mafia members, and that key meetings were after Borsellino's death.<ref>Follain, ''Vendetta'', p. 44 & pp. 187-8</ref>

==Crackdown==
On 15 January 1993, acting on a tip-off from an informant, armed police from the [[Carabinieri]] arrested Tot<U+00F2> Riina in Palermo<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D8153AF935A25752C0A965958260&scp=11&sq=riina&st=nyt Italy Arrests Sicilian Mafia's Top Leader], The New York Times, January 16, 1993</ref> as he sat in his car at a traffic-light  (his former driver, [[Balduccio Di Maggio]], was the informant in question; several of his relatives were later murdered for this <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/68229.stm Brother of top Mafia turncoat shot], BBC News, March 21, 1998</ref>). Riina claimed to be just a poor harassed accountant, and in his ill-fitting suit, the chubby, softly-spoken 62 year old looked to be just that. Asked about the firm he worked at, he answered that he would not mention it in order not to damage their reputation. Hauled into custody, Riina was polite and respectful towards his captors, and later thanked the police officers and court officials for treating him well, although he managed to insult their intelligence by not only saying that he had never heard of the Mafia but also by insisting that he had "no idea" he had been Sicily's most wanted fugitive for the last three decades. Other accounts also say that Riina kept on shouting "communists!" to the policemen arresting him and to the court processing him.

==Terror attacks==
On 14 May television host [[Maurizio Costanzo]], who had expressed delight at the arrest of Riina, was almost killed by a bomb as he drove down a Rome street, 23 people were injured. The explosion was part of a series, on May 27, 1993 a bomb under the [[Torre dei Pulci]]  killed five people: Fabrizio Nencini, wife Angelamaria; their daughters; 9-year-old Nadia and two-month-old Caterina, and Dario Capolicchio, aged 20. 33 people were injured.<ref>[http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=7762 The Olive Tree of Peace: The massacre in via dei Georgofili], The Florentine, May 24, 2012)</ref> Attacks on art galleries and churches left 10 dead with many injured, and caused outrage among Italians. Some investigators believed most of those who carried out murders for Cosa Nostra answered solely to [[Leoluca Bagarella]], and that consequently Bagarella actually welded more power than [[Bernardo Provenzano]] who was Rimma's formal successor. Provenzano reportedly protested about the terroristic attacks, but Bagarella responded sarcastically, telling Provenzano to wear a sign saying "I don't have anything to do with the massacres".<ref>Follain, (2012), ''Vendetta'', pp. 230-231</ref>

==Controversy about Riina's arrest==
[[Image:Salvatore Riina.gif|thumb|300px|left|Mafia boss Tot<U+00F2> Riina behind bars in court after his arrest in 1993]]
The public's delight at Riina's arrest (one newspaper had the sensationalistic headline "The Devil" pasted over Riina's mugshot) was dampened somewhat when it was revealed that, during his thirty years as a fugitive, Riina had actually been living at home in Palermo all along. He had obtained medical attention for his [[diabetes]] and registered all four of his children under their real names at the local hospital. He even went to Venice on honeymoon and was still unspotted. Many cynically declared that the authorities only arrested Riina because they were under public pressure to do so after the Falcone/Borsellino murders, and saw the ease with which Riina had evaded justice for so long as an example of what many regarded as the apathetic <U+2013> if not actually complicit <U+2013> attitudes of the Sicilian authorities to the Mafia.

[[Giovanni Brusca]] <U+2013> one of Riina's hitmen who personally detonated the bomb that killed Falcone, and later became an informant after his 1996 arrest <U+2013> has offered a controversial version of the capture of Tot<U+00F2> Riina: a secret deal between [[Carabinieri]] officers, secret agents and Cosa Nostra bosses tired of the dictatorship of the Corleonesi. According to Brusca, [[Bernardo Provenzano]] "sold" Riina in exchange for the valuable archive of compromising material that Riina held in his apartment in Via Bernini 52 in Palermo.<ref name=schneider156>Schneider & Schneider, ''Reversible Destiny'', p. 156</ref><ref name=lodato135>Lodato, ''Ho ucciso Giovanni Falcone'', pp. 135<U+2013>37</ref>

The Carabinieri<U+2019>s ROS (''[[Carabinieri#Special organisations|Reparto Operativo Speciale]]'') persuaded the Palermo Public Prosecutor's Office not to immediately search the Riina<U+2019>s apartment, and then abandoned surveillance of the apartment after six hours leaving it unprotected. The apartment was only raided 18 days later but it had been completely emptied. According to the Carabinieri commanders the house was abandoned because they didn't consider it to be important and they actually never told the prosecutor to be willing to maintain the surveillance during the following days.<ref name="jamieson">{{cite book|last=Jamieson|first=Alison|title=The Antimafia: Italy's Fight Against Organized Crime|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke|isbn=0-333-71900-X}}</ref>

This version of Riina<U+2019>s arrest has been denied by Carabinieri commander, general [[Mario Mori]] (at the time deputy head of the ROS). Mori, however, confirmed that channels of communication were opened with Cosa Nostra through [[Vito Ciancimino]] <U+2013> a former mayor of Palermo convicted for Mafia association <U+2013> who was close to the Corleonesi. To sound out the willingness of Mafiosi to talk, Ciancimino contacted Riina<U+2019>s private doctor, [[Antonino Cin<U+00E0>]]. When Ciancimino was informed that the goal was to arrest Riina, he seemed unwilling to continue. At this point, the arrest and cooperation of [[Balduccio Di Maggio]] led to the arrest of Riina. In 2006, the Palermo Court absolved Mario Mori and Captain "Ultimo" ([[Sergio De Caprio]]) <U+2013> the man who arrested Riina <U+2013> of the charge of consciously aiding and abetting the Mafia.

However, in November 2009, [[Massimo Ciancimino]] <U+2013> the son of Vito Ciancimino <U+2013> said that Provenzano betrayed the whereabouts of Riina. Police sent Vito Ciancimino maps of Palermo. One of the maps was delivered to Provenzano, then a mafia fugitive. Ciancimino said the map was returned by Provenzano who indicated the precise location of Riina's hiding place.<ref name=ansa051109>[http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/rubriche/english/2009/11/05/visualizza_new.html_994173998.html Boss Riina 'betrayed' by Provenzano], ANSA, November 5, 2009</ref><ref name=aki051109>[http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Security/?id=3.0.3955391781 Italy: Top Mafia fugitive 'betrayed' by boss], Adnkronos International, November 5, 2009</ref>

==In jail==
Although he already had two life-sentences, Riina was nonetheless tried and convicted of over a hundred counts of [[murder]], including sanctioning the slayings of Falcone and Borsellino. In October 1993, nine months after his capture, Riina was convicted of ordering the murders of [[Vincenzo Puccio]] and his brother Pietro.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mafia-kingpin-jailed-for-life-1509537.html Mafia Kingpin Jailed for Life], The Independent, October 9, 1993</ref>

In 1998, Riina picked up yet another life sentence for the high-profile murder of [[Salvo Lima]], a politician who had long since been suspected of being in league with the Mafia and who had been shot dead in 1992 after he had failed to prevent the convictions of Mafiosi in the Maxi Trial of the mid 1980s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/133525.stm Italian Mafia bosses get life sentences], BBC News, July 15, 1998</ref>

Riina is currently held in a maximum-security prison with [[Article 41-bis prison regime|limited contact]] with the outside world in order to prevent him from running his organization from behind bars, as many others have done. Over $125,000,000 in assets were confiscated from Riina <U+2013> probably just a fraction of his illicit fortune <U+2013> and his vast mansion was also acquired by the crusading anti-Mafia mayor of Corleone in 1997. In a move that was both practical and symbolic, this mansion was turned into a school for the local children.

In 2004 it was reported that Riina had suffered two heart attacks in May and December the previous year. In April 2006, a full thirteen years after his arrest, he was on trial for the murder of a journalist, [[Mauro De Mauro]], who vanished without trace in September 1970. One of Riina's close friends in the Corleonesi Clan, [[Bernardo Provenzano]], was believed to have taken over as head of the organization. Provenzano was arrested on April 11, 2006, in the countryside near Corleone after forty-three years in hiding.

==Family==
[[Image:GiuseppeSalvatoreRiina.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Giuseppe Salvatore Riina]]

Salvatore Riina married Ninetta (sister of [[Leoluca Bagarella]]) in 1974, and they had four children. His two sons, Giovanni and Giuseppe, followed in their father's footsteps and have since joined him behind bars. In November 2001, a court in Palermo sentenced 24-year-old Giovanni to life in prison for four murders. He had been in police custody since 1997.<ref name=bbc050602>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2027306.stm Mafia suspects held in 'Godfather' town], BBC News, June 5, 2002</ref> According to [[Antonio Ingroia]], one of the prosecutors of the [[Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia]] (DDA) of Palermo, Giovanni is among the possible leading figures in the Sicilian Cosa Nostra after the arrest of Provenzano in 2006 and [[Salvatore Lo Piccolo]] in 2007, but still too young to be recognized as leading boss of the organisation.<ref name=ad56>{{it icon}} [http://www.antimafiaduemila.com/content/view/2240/ Lo Piccolo, il fautore della strategia della <U+201C>rimmersione<U+201D>], Intervista ad Antonio Ingroia, Antimafia Duemila n. 56, Anno VII<U+00B0> Numero 5 <U+2013> 2007</ref> On December 31, 2004, Riina's youngest son, Giuseppe, one of those taken into custody in June 2002, was sentenced to 14 years for various crimes, including Mafia association, extortion and [[money laundering]].<ref>[http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,6119,2-10-1462_1641943,00.html Mafia boss's son jailed], News24.com, December 31, 2004</ref> He was found to have established Mafia-controlled companies to hide money from protection rackets, drug-trafficking and tenders for public building contracts on the island.

One of Riina's daughters was elected class representative in her high school, where she was able to return, aged 21, after the family came out of hiding.

In 2006, the council of Corleone created T-shirts reading ''I love Corleone'' in an attempt to dissociate the town from its infamous Mafiosi, but one of his daughters' brothers-in law began an attempt to sue the Corleone mayor by claiming the Riina family owned the copyright to the phrase.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2356726,00.html Mafia family sues over Godfather town T-shirt], The Times (UK), September 14, 2006</ref>

==Personality==
Due to his  habits of secrecy and evasiveness, Riina's personality remains enigmatic. An informant, [[Antonino Calderone]], described Riina as being "unbelievably ignorant, but he had an intuition and intelligence and was difficult to fathom ... very hard to predict". He said Riina was soft spoken and a dedicated father and husband. Riina was highly persuasive and often highly sentimental. He followed the simple codes of the brutal, ancient world of the Sicilian countryside, where force is the only law and there is no contradiction between personal kindness and extreme ferocity. "His philosophy was that if someone<U+2019>s finger hurt, it was better to cut off his whole arm just to make sure", Calderone said.<ref>Stille, ''Excellent Cadavers'', pp. 230<U+2013>31.</ref>

One of the more bizarre anecdotes Calderone related was that of Riina giving a tearful [[eulogy]] at the funeral of Calderone's murdered brother, even though Riina himself had ordered the killing. Calderone also said that, when Riina set his sights on marrying his sweetheart, Ninetta, the young lady's family objected to the union. Calderone quoted Riina as saying "I don't want any woman other than my Ninetta, and if they [her family] don't let me marry her, I'll have to kill some people." Ninetta's family soon dropped any opposition to Riina's matrimonial plans.

[[Giovanni Brusca]] claimed that, during 1991 and early 1992, Riina contemplated acts of [[terrorism]] against the state to get it to back off in its crackdown against the Mafia, including acts such as bombing the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]. In fact, during the months after Riina's arrest, there was a series of bombings by the Corleonesi against several tourist spots on the Italian mainland, resulting in the deaths of ten people, including an entire family. Brusca also quoted Riina as declaring that the children of informants were legitimate targets. Brusca subsequently tortured and killed the 11-year-old son of an informant in a failed attempt to silence the boy's father, who had been giving testimony against Riina.

Although Riina's criminal actions were geared towards the acquisition of wealth and power, his treachery and the sheer number of murders he either committed or sanctioned seem excessive even by the standards of other [[gangsters]]. This may suggest that he was a [[psychopath]], but his clandestine nature even after capture, and refusal to say much more than protestations of innocence, mean any profound theories about his [[psychology|psychological]] state are only second-hand speculation.

==In popular culture==
He was played by [[Victor Cavallo]] in the [[HBO]] movie ''Excellent Cadavers'' which was based on the events in [[Excellent Cadavers|the book of the same name]] by [[Alexander Stille]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151734/ Excellent Cadavers at the Internet Movie Database]</ref>

In 2007, Italian television broadcast ''[[Il Capo dei Capi]]'' (The Boss of Bosses), a six-part [[miniseries]] based on Riina's life and crimes <ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975289.html?categoryId=2526&cs=1 Riina watches life story from jail cell], Variety, November 5, 2007</ref> He was played by [[Claudio Gio<U+00E8>]].

In 2009 it was reported that Riina and several fellow Mafiosi had [[fan clubs]] set up on their behalf on the social networking site [[Facebook]], including one that called for Riina's release, claiming he was "a misunderstood man". [[Rita Borsellino]], sister of Paolo Borsellino, was one of a number of high-profile Italians who condemned the idolization of Mafiosi.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h55iiq-fPi47Nj5WLMVzAzPjssJA Fans of Mafia supremos get comeuppance on Facebook], AFP, January 10, 2009</ref>
