'''''The Eraser''''' is the debut solo album by [[Thom Yorke]] of the English alternative rock band [[Radiohead]], released on 10 July 2006 on the independent label [[XL Recordings]]. It was produced by [[Nigel Godrich]].

The album comprises [[electronic music]] Yorke recorded during Radiohead's 2004 hiatus and between their 2005 rehearsals. The lyrics express Yorke's political concerns; "[[Harrowdown Hill]]" was written about the death of [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], a [[whistleblower]] who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. The album artwork, by [[Stanley Donwood]], was inspired by the [[King Canute and the waves|legend of King Canute failing to command the ocean]], which Yorke likened to government attitudes towards [[climate change]].

''The Eraser'' debuted at number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and number two on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was named one of the best albums of 2006 by the ''[[NME]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'', and was nominated for the 2006 [[Mercury Music Prize]] and the 2007 [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]].

The album produced two singles, "[[Analyse (Thom Yorke song)|Analyse]]" and "Harrowdown Hill". It was followed in the same year by a B-sides EP, ''[[Spitting Feathers]]'', and in 2009 a [[remix album]], ''[[The Eraser Rmxs]].'' In 2010, to perform the album live, Yorke formed [[Atoms for Peace (band)|Atoms for Peace]] with musicians including Godrich and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]].

==Background and recording==
[[File:Yorkelatitude.JPG|thumb|In July 2009, Yorke played a solo performance at the [[Latitude Festival]] in England, performing ''Eraser'' material.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Thom Yorke debuts new song at Latitude festival - video|url = http://www.nme.com/news/radiohead/46193|accessdate = 2015-05-04}}</ref>]]
In 2004, after finishing the tour for their sixth album ''[[Hail to the Thief]]'' (2003)'','' Yorke's band [[Radiohead]] went on a year-long hiatus. Yorke began recording ''The Eraser'' with Radiohead producer [[Nigel Godrich]] in late 2004 and continued work throughout 2005 between Radiohead rehearsals.<ref name="Rolling_Stone">{{cite web |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/radioheads-frontman-goes-solo-20060615 |title = Radiohead's Thom Yorke on Going Solo |accessdate = 16 July 2006 |author = Fricke, David |authorlink = David Fricke |date = 1 June 2006 |publisher = ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' }}</ref> He told [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]: "I've been in the band since we left school and never dared do anything on my own ...

== Music and lyrics ==
The ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' described ''The Eraser'' as "an insidious collection of skittery beats and pattery rhythms and minimal [[post-rock]]isms".<ref name=":2" /> The ''[[LA Times]]'' described it as "an evocative portrait of life made slippery by urban sprawl, murky political alliances and global warming ... with the blips and bleeps of Yorke's laptop excursions coalescing into soulful, politically charged songs."<ref name=":3" /> Pitchfork described it as "glitchy, sour, feminine, brooding".<ref name="pitchfork">{{Cite web|title = Thom Yorke: The Eraser|url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9183-the-eraser/|accessdate = 2015-05-03}}</ref> Citing inspiration from the 1997 [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]] album ''[[Homogenic]],'' Yorke said the album was designed to be heard in an "isolated space ''<U+2013>'' on headphones, or stuck in traffic."<ref name=":3" />

[[David Fricke]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt the album's lyrics have an "emotional and pictorial directness, rare for Yorke".<ref name="Rolling_Stone" /> Yorke said the album title was inspired by "these huge elephants that we have in the room at the moment, in the West, and people are desperately trying to erase them from public consciousness."<ref name=":0" /> According to the ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'', "The Clock", influenced by [[Arabic music]], is a "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'."<ref name=":0" /> "[[Analyse (Thom Yorke song)|Analyse]]" was inspired by a [[power outage|blackout]] Yorke experienced in his hometown [[Oxford]]: "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful."<ref name="Rolling_Stone" />

"Harrowdown Hill" was written about [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]], a [[whistleblower]] who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] in Iraq. His body was found in the Harrowdown Hill woods near Yorke's former school in Oxfordshire.<ref name=":3" /> According to the ''Globe and Mail'', the song resembles a love song with a sense of "menace" and "grim political showdown".<ref name="H">{{cite web |url = http://www.ateaseweb.com/2006/06/14/thom-yorke-interview-in-globe-and-mail/|title = Radiohead retooled|accessdate = 14 June 2006|author = Everett-Green, Robert|date = 14 June 2006|publisher = ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''}}</ref> Yorke was uncomfortable about the subject matter and conscious of Kelly's grieving family, but felt that "not to write it would perhaps have been worse."<ref name=":0" /> In an interview with the ''Observer'', he said it was "the most angry song" he'd ever written.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795948,00.html |title = All Messed Up |accessdate = 18 June 2006 |author = Mclean, Craig |date = 18 June 2006 |publisher = ''[[The Observer|Observer Music Monthly]]'' }}</ref>

Louis Patterson of the ''[[NME]]'' praised Yorke's vocals and likened the album to Radiohead's 2000 album ''[[Kid A]],'' writing: "Some will mourn its lack of viscera; its coldness; its reluctance to rock.
