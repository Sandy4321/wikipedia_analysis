The '''Chora Church''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''Kariye M<U+00FC>zesi'', ''Kariye Camii'', or ''Kariye Kilisesi'' <U+2014> the ''Chora Museum, Mosque or Church'') is considered to be one of the most beautiful examples of a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[church]].<ref>Ousterhout</ref> The church is situated in the western, [[Edirnekap<U+0131>]] district of [[Istanbul]]. In the [[16th century]], the church was converted into a [[mosque]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rulers]], and it became a secularised museum in [[1948]]. The interior of the building is covered with fine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]es.

== History ==
[[Image:HSX Millingen 1912 fig 108-109.jpg|thumb|Sketch map of the church interior]]
[[Image:HSX Millingen 1912 fig 105.jpg|thumb|Sketch map of the interior plan of the Chora Church]]
The Chora Church was originally built outside the walls of [[Constantinople]], to the south of the [[Golden Horn]]. The church's full name was the '''Church of the Holy Saviour in the Country''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{polytonic|<U+1F21> <U+1F18><U+03BA><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+1F0D><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+03A3><U+03C9><U+03C4><U+1FC6><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+1F10><U+03BD> <U+03C4><U+1FC3> <U+03A7><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+1FB3>}}, ''h<U+0113> Ekkl<U+0113>sia tou Hagiou S<U+014D>t<U+0113>ros en t<U+0113> Ch<U+014D>ra'').<ref>and therefore sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Saint Saviour"</ref> The last part of that name, ''Chora'', referring to its location originally outside of the walls, became the shortened name of the church. The original church on this site was built in the early [[5th century]], and stood outside of the [[4th century]] walls of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]]. However, when [[Theodosius II]] built his formidable [[Walls of Constantinople|land walls]] in [[413]]<U+2013>[[414]], the church became incorporated within the city's defences, but retained the name ''Chora''. The name must have carried symbolic meaning, as the mosaics in the [[narthex]] describe [[Christ]] as the ''Land of the Living'' ({{polytonic|<U+1F21> <U+03A7><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03B6><U+03CE><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD>}}, ''h<U+0113> Ch<U+014D>ra t<U+014D>n z<U+014D>nt<U+014D>n'') and [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]], as the ''Container of the Uncontainable'' ({{polytonic|<U+1F21> <U+03A7><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+1F08><U+03C7><U+03CE><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C5>}}, ''h<U+0113> Ch<U+014D>ra tou Ach<U+014D>r<U+0113>tou'').

The majority of the fabric of the current building dates from [[1077]]<U+2013>[[1081]], when Maria Dukaina, the mother-in-law of [[Alexius I Comnenus]], rebuilt the Chora Church as an inscribed cross or [[quincunx]]: a popular architectural style of the time. Early in the [[12th century]], the church suffered a partial collapse, perhaps due to an [[earthquake]]. The church was rebuilt by Isaac Comnenus, Alexius's third son. However, it was only after the third phase of building, two centuries after, that the church as it stands today was completed. The powerful Byzantine statesman [[Theodore Metochites]] endowed the church with much of its fine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]s. Theodore's impressive decoration of the interior was carried out between [[1315]] and [[1321]]. The mosaic-work is the finest example of the [[Palaeologus|Palaeologian]] Renaissance. The artists remain unknown. In [[1328]], Theodore was sent into exile by the usurper [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]]. However, he was allowed to return to the city two years later, and lived out the last two years of his life as a [[monk]] in his Chora Church.

During the last [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] [[Hodegetria]], considered the protector of the City, was brought to Chora in order to assist the defenders against the assault of the [[Ottomans]].<ref>Van Millingen</ref>

Around fifty years after the fall of the city to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], At<U+0131>k Ali Pa<U+015F>a, the [[Grand Vizier]] of Sultan [[Bayezid II]], ordered the Chora Church to be converted into a [[mosque]] <U+2014> ''Kariye Camii''. Due to the [[iconoclasm|prohibition against iconic images]] in [[Islam]], the mosaics and frescoes were covered behind a layer of plaster. This and frequent earthquakes in the region have taken their toll on the artwork.

In [[1948]], Thomas Whittemore and Paul A. Underwood, from the Byzantine Institute of America and the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] Center for Byzantine Studies, sponsored a programme of restoration. From that time on, the building ceased to be a functioning mosque. In [[1958]], it was opened to the public as a museum <U+2014> ''Kariye M<U+00FC>zesi''.

== Interior ==
[[Image:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 011.jpg|thumb|The Virgin and child, painted dome of the ''parecclesion'' of Chora Church.]]
The Chora Church is not as large as some of the other Byzantine churches of Istanbul (it covers 742.5 m<U+00B2>), but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in the beauty of its interior. The building divides into three main areas: the entrance hall or ''[[narthex]]'', the main body of the church or ''[[nave|naos]]'', and the side chapel or ''parecclesion''. The building has six [[dome]]s: two in the esonarthex, one in the parecclesion and three in the naos.

=== Narthex ===
The main, west door of the Chora Church opens into the [[narthex]]. It divides north-south into the ''exonarthex'' and ''esonarthex''.

==== Exonarthex ====
[[Image:Meister der Kahriye-Cami-Kirche in Istanbul 004.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the journey to Bethlehem]]
[[Image:Meister der Kahriye-Cami-Kirche in Istanbul 005.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the enrollment for taxation before [[Zyrenius]]]]
The exonarthex (or outer narthex) is the first part of the church that one enters. It is a transverse corridor, 4 m wide and 23 m long, which is partially open on its eastern length into the parallel esonarthex. The southern end of the exonarthex opens out through the esonarthex forming a western ante-chamber to the parecclesion. The mosaics that decorate the exonarthex include:

# Joseph's dream and journey to Bethlehem;
# Enrollment for taxation;
# Nativity, birth of Christ;
# Journey of the Magi;
# Inquiry of King Herod;
# Flight into Egypt;
# Two frescoes of the massacres ordered by King Herod;
# Mothers mourning for their children;
# Flight of Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist;
# Joseph dreaming, return of the holy family from Egypt to Nazareth;
# Christ taken to Jerusalem for the Passover;
# John the Baptist bearing witness to Christ;
# Miracle; 
# Three more Miracles.
# Jesus Christ;
# Virgin and Angels praying.

==== Esonarthex ====

[[Image:Chora Christ south coupole.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of Christ Pantocrator, south dome of inner narthex]] 
The esonarthex (or inner narthex) is similar to the exonarthex, running parallel to it. Like the exonarthex, the esonarthex is 4 m wide, but it is slightly shorter, 18 m long. Its central, eastern door opens into the naos, whilst another door, at the southern end of the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a door from the esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the [[prothesis]]. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.

# Enthroned Christ with [[Theodore Metochites]] presenting a model of his church;
# [[Saint Peter]];
# [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]];
# [[Deesis]], Christ and the Virgin Mary (without John the Baptist) with two donors below;
# Genealogy of Christ;
# Religious and noble ancestors of Christ.

The mosaics in the first three bays of the inner narthex give an account of the [[Life of the Virgin]], and her parents. Some of them are as follows:
# Rejection of [[Joachim|Joachim's]] offerings;
# Annunciation of [[Saint Anne]], the angel of the Lord announcing to Anne that her prayer for a child has been heard;
# Meeting of Joachim and Anne;
# Birth of the Virgin Mary;
# First seven steps of the Virgin;
# The Virgin given affection by her parents;
# The Virgin blessed by the priests;
# Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple;
# The Virgin receiving bread from an Angel;
# The Virgin receiving the skein of purple wool, as the priests decided to have the attendant maidens weave a veil for the Temple;
# [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] praying, when it was the time to marry for the Virgin, High Priest Zechariah called all the widowers together and placed their rods on the altar, praying for a sign showing to whom she should be given;
# The Virgin entrusted to Joseph;
# Joseph taking the Virgin to his house;
# [[Annunciation]] to the Virgin at the well;
# Joseph leaving the Virgin, Joseph had to leave for six months on business and when he returned the Virgin was pregnant and he is suspicious of that.

=== Naos ===
[[Image:HSX Koimetesis.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the ''Koimesis'' in the Naos]]
The central doors of the esonarthex lead into the main body of the church, the ''naos''. The largest dome in the church (7.7 m diameter) is above the centre of the naos. Two smaller domes flank the modest [[apse]]: the northern dome is over the [[prothesis]], which is linked by short passage to the [[bema]]; the southern dome is over the [[diaconicon]], which is reached via the parecclesion.
# ''Koimesis'', the Dormition of the Virgin. Before ascending to Heaven, her last sleep. Jesus is holding an infant, symbol of Mary's soul;
# Jesus Christ;
# ''Theodokos'', the Virgin Mary with child.

=== Parecclesion ===
[[Image:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 010.jpg|thumb|View into the ''parekklesion'']]
[[Image:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 013.jpg|thumb|The [[Anastasis]] fresco in the ''parekklesion'' of the Chora Church.]]
To the right of the esonarthex, doors open into the side chapel, or ''parecclesion''. The parecclesion was used as a mortuary chapel for family burials and memorials. The second largest dome (4.5 m diameter) in the church graces the centre of the roof of the parecclesion. A small passageway links the parecclesion directly into the naos, and off this passage can be found a small oratory and a storeroom. The parecclesion is covered in [[fresco]]es:

# [[Anastasis]], the Resurrection. Christ, who had just broken down the gates of hell, is standing in the middle and pulling Adam and Eve out of their tombs. Behind Adam stand John the Baptist, David, and Solomon. Others are righteous kings;
# Second coming of Christ, the last judgment. Jesus is enthroned and on both sides the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist (this trio is also called the Deesis);
# Virgin and Child;
# Heavenly Court of Angels;
# Two panels of Moses.
