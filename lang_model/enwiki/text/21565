The Portuguese '''National Republican Guard''' ({{lang-pt|'''Guarda Nacional Republicana, GNR'''}}) is the [[gendarmerie]] of [[Portugal]]. Members of the GNR are soldiers, who, unlike the agents of the [[Pol<U+00ED>cia de Seguran<U+00E7>a P<U+00FA>blica|Public Security Police (PSP)]], are subject to military law and organisation. The GNR is responsible for law enforcement in the countryside and small towns (large urban centers are patrolled by the PSP), and providing a national [[highway patrol]] and [[Customs|fiscal guard]]. There are also two military reserve regiments: an Infantry Regiment and a Cavalry Regiment. The GNR also has ceremonial duties and provides guards of honor.

In the 2000s, the GNR has provided detachments for participation in international operations in Iraq and East Timor. {{As of|2008}}, the GNR maintains "Detachment Bravo" in [[East Timor]], comprising about 200 personnel, who perform the task of helping to maintain public order in that former Portuguese colony.

==Strength==
The GNR deploys over 26,000 personnel over 90 percent of Portuguese territory.<ref>http://www.gnr.pt/portal/internet/Treeview/Dynamictree.asp?NodeId=-757380300&IdPage=18</ref> and they are also deployed in [[East Timor]] as part of [[UNTAET]] and [[Bosnia]] as part of [[IFOR]]/[[SFOR]]/[[EUFOR Althea]].<ref>http://www.gnr.pt/portal/internet/Treeview/Dynamictree.asp?NodeId=-757380300&IdPage=18</ref>

==History==
[[File:DuartePimentel13.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A member of the Royal Police Guard of Lisbon.]]
The National Republican Guard is the direct descendant of the Royal Police Guard created in the beginning of the 19th century.

===Royal Police Guard, 1801===
The Lisbon's "Royal Police Guard" (''Guarda Real da Pol<U+00ED>cia'') was created in 1801 by [[John VI of Portugal|Prince Regent John]] on the initiative of the Intendant-General of the Police of the Court and the Kingdom, [[Pina Manique]]. It took as a model the French Gendarmerie (1791). Following the creation of the Lisbon's Royal Police Guard, the a Royal Police Guard was created for Porto and [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|another for Rio de Janeiro]]. The latter subsequently provided the origin of the [[Military Police (Brazil)|Military Police]] forces of the member states of [[Brazil]].

===Municipal Guard, 1834===
At the end of May, 1834, as a result of the [[Liberal Wars|Civil War]], King [[Pedro I of Brazil|Peter IV]], assuming the regency in name of his daughter [[Maria II of Portugal|Queen Mary II]], disbanded the Royal Police Guard in Lisbon and Porto, creating the "Municipal Guards" of Lisbon and Porto on the basis of similar conditions. In 1868 both of the Guards were put under a unified General Command, installed in the Carmo Barracks in Lisbon, which today still is the Headquarters of the GNR. The Municipal Guard was considered part of the Army, but was dependent on the Ministry of Internal Affairs for all matters regarding public security.

===Republican Guard, 1910===
After the coup of the 5 October 1910, which substituted the Constitutional Monarchy with the Republic, the new regime changed the name of the Municipal Guard to the Republican Guard (''Guarda Republicana'').

===National Republican Guard, 1911===
In 1911, the name changed to National Republican Guard: this was to be a security force consisting of military personnel organised in a special corps of troops depending, in peace time, on the Ministry of Internal Administration, for the purpose of conscription, administration and execution with regards to its mission, and the Ministry of the National Defense for the purpose of uniformization and normalization of the military doctrine, as well as for its armament and equipment. In case of war or situation of crisis, the forces of National Republican Guard will, in terms of the respective laws and for operational effect, be subordinated to the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. In 1993 the National Republican Guard absorbed the independent Fiscal Guard (''[[Guarda Fiscal]]'') that became the Fiscal Brigade of the GNR. In 2006 a new GNR unit was created with the purpose of firefighting and was named GIPS.

A small contingent of GNR forces were deployed in [[Timor-Leste]] in 2006 (see video below).
