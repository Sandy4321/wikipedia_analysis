'''Tropical Storm Bret''' was a relatively weak [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic tropical cyclone]] that stayed at sea during the [[2011 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The second storm of the season, Bret developed on July 17 to the north of the [[Bahamas]], along the southwestern periphery of a [[weather front]]. It gradually strengthened in response to favorable upper-level conditions, reaching peak [[Maximum sustained wind|sustained winds]] of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) while moving little. [[Tropical_cyclone_track_forecasting#Basics|Steering currents]] subsequently became better established in the area, and the storm turned toward the northeast only to encounter a substantial increase in vertical [[wind shear]]. Despite the shear, Bret maintained a well-defined [[cyclone|cyclonic]] wind circulation for several days, with intermittent bursts of [[thunderstorm]]s occurring near the center. By July 22, it had been devoid of strong thunderstorm activity for several hours, prompting the [[National Hurricane Center]] to discontinue advisories when the storm was located about 375&nbsp;miles (605&nbsp;km) north of [[Bermuda]].

Since Bret remained over the open Atlantic for most of its duration, its effects on land were limited. While it was moving little, the storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness over much of the north-central Bahamas. Squalls off the coast of [[Florida]] generated rough seas along coastlines, injuring a number of people. Although it remained well offshore, the storm enhanced moisture that caused beneficial rainfall in Bermuda.

{{storm path|Bret 2011 track.png}}
In mid-July, a broad upper [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] dropped southward over the northwest [[Atlantic]], supporting a [[cold front]] that extended westward across [[Bermuda]] to inland over [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/2011/TWDAT.201107150552.txt|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|date=2011-07-15|accessdate=2011-07-17|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Wallace, Patricia}}</ref> The front produced a large area of light showers to its north, as the westernmost component remained quasi-stationary over northeastern [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/2011/TWDAT.201107160008.txt|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|date=2011-07-15|accessdate=2011-07-17|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Christensen, Eric}}</ref> On July 16, a [[low-pressure area|surface low]] developed just off the coast along the decaying [[stationary front|boundary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/text/TWDAT/2011/TWDAT.201107161754.txt|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|date=2011-07-15|accessdate=2011-07-17|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Garcia, Felix}}</ref> producing an area of sporadic [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] just to the north of the [[Bahamas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/gtwo/atl/201107161742/index.php?basin=atl|title=Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook|date=2011-07-16|accessdate=2011-07-22|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Stewart, Stacy}}</ref> Although a circulation was initially absent and [[Atmospheric_pressure#Mean_sea_level_pressure|surface pressures]] remained relatively high, the low later became better organized under abating [[Wind shear|shear conditions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/gtwo/atl/201107170538/index.php?basin=atl|title=Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook|date=2011-07-16|accessdate=2011-07-17|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Beven, Jack}}</ref> At 2100&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;17, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) declared it a tropical depression about 100&nbsp;mi (160&nbsp;km) northwest of [[Abaco Islands|Great Abaco Island]], after [[Hurricane Hunters|reconnaissance]] confirmed the presence of a closed circulation center.<ref name=discuss1>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2011/al02/al022011.discus.001.shtml?|title=Tropical Depression Two Discussion Number One|date=2011-07-17|accessdate=2011-07-17|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Pasch, Richard/Stewart, Stacy}}</ref> It strengthened into Tropical Storm Bret just three hours later, owing to a quick increase in winds and deep central convection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2011/al02/al022011.discus.002.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Bret Advisory Number Two|date=2011-07-18|accessdate=2011-07-18|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Brown, Dan/Berg, Robbie}}</ref>

Situated along a weakness in the [[subtropical ridge]], the cyclone drifted very slowly southward during the initial stages of its existence.<ref name=discuss1 /> Though traces of dry air were noted to its west, Bret continued to strengthen; prominent [[Rainband|band]]s of deep thunderstorms tightened around the eastern semicircle of the storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2011/al02/al022011.discus.003.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Bret Advisory Number Three|date=2011-07-18|accessdate=2011-07-22|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|author=Brennan, Michael}}</ref> [[Weather satellite|Satellite images]] displayed a disorganized [[Eye (cyclone)|eye-like feature]] on July 18, suggesting a rather sharp increase in strength.
