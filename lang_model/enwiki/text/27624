Determining where Ediacaran organisms fit in the tree of life has proven challenging; it is not even established that they were animals, with suggestions that they were lichens (fungus-alga symbionts), algae, protists known as foraminifera, fungi or microbial colonies, to hypothetical intermediates between plants and animals.

==History==
[[File:oldest multi-cellular animal.jpg|thumb|left|Paleontologist Guy Narbonne examining Ediacaran fossils in Newfoundland]] 
The first Ediacaran fossils discovered were the disc-shaped ''[[Aspidella]] terranovica'' in 1868. Their discoverer, Scottish geologist [[Alexander Murray (geologist)|Alexander Murray]], found them useful aids for correlating the age of rocks around [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].<ref name=Gehling1999a /> However since they lay below the "Primordial Strata" of the [[Cambrian]] that was then thought to contain the very first signs of animal life, a proposal four years after their discovery by [[Elkanah Billings]] that these simple forms represented fauna was dismissed by his peers, interpreted instead as [[fumarole|gas escape]] structures or inorganic [[concretion]]s.<ref name=Gehling1999a /> No similar structures elsewhere in the world were then known and the one-sided debate soon fell into obscurity.<ref name=Gehling1999a>{{Cite journal|title=The First Named Ediacaran Body Fossil, Aspidella terranovica|first=James G. |last=Gehling |coauthors=Guy M.

It was not until the British discovery of the iconic ''[[Charnia]]'' in 1957 that the pre-Cambrian was seriously considered as containing life. This [[frond]]-shaped fossil was found in England's [[Charnwood Forest]],<ref>{{cite web

All specimens discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained [[sandstone]] that prevented preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B.

Poor communication, combined with the difficulty in correlating globally distinct [[formation (geology)|formation]]s, led to a plethora of different names for the biota.
In 1960 the French name "Ediacarien"&nbsp;<U+2013> after the Ediacaran Hills in [[South Australia]], which take their name from [[Indigenous Australians#Languages|aborigine]] ''Idiyakra'', "water is present"&nbsp;<U+2013> was added to the competing terms "Sinian" and "Vendian"<ref name=Termier1960>{{Cite journal

"Ediacaran" and "Ediacarian" were subsequently applied to the epoch or period of [[geologic time scale|geological time]] and its corresponding rocks.

==Preservation==
[[Image:Cyanobacterial-algal mat.jpg|thumb|right|Modern [[cyanobacterial]]-algal mat, salty lake on the [[White Sea]] seaside]]
{{Main|Ediacaran type preservation}}

The majority of the fossil record consists of the robust matter of decayed corpses.{{Citation needed|date = June 2012}} The Ediacaran biota had soft bodies and no skeletons, making their abundant preservation surprising. The absence of burrowing creatures living in the sediments undoubtedly helped.<ref name="Stanley1973"/> After the evolution of these organisms in the Cambrian, soft-bodied impressions were usually [[Bioturbation|disturbed]] before they could fossilize.{{citation needed|date = June 2012}}

===Microbial mats===
[[Image:Charniodiscus.png|thumb|upright|The fossil ''Charniodiscus'' is barely distinguishable from the "elephant skin" texture on this cast.]]
[[Microbial mat]]s are areas of sediment stabilised by the presence of colonies of microbes which secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.<ref name=Runnegar1992>{{Cite book

Some Ediacaran strata with the texture characteristics of microbial mats contain fossils, and Ediacaran fossils are almost always found in beds that contain these microbial mats.

===Fossilisation===
The preservation of these fossils is one of their great fascinations to science. As soft-bodied organisms they would normally not fossilise and, unlike later soft-bodied fossil biota such as the [[Burgess Shale]] or [[Solnhofen Limestone]], the Ediacara biota is not found in a restricted environment subject to unusual local conditions: they were a global phenomenon. The processes that were operating must have been systemic and worldwide. There was something very different about the Ediacaran Period that permitted these delicate creatures to be left behind and it is thought that the fossils were preserved by virtue of rapid covering by ash or sand, trapping them against the mud or microbial mats on which they lived.<ref name="Narbonne1998">{{Cite journal

However it is more common to find Ediacaran fossils under sandy beds deposited by storms or high-energy bottom-scraping ocean currents known as [[turbidite]]s.<ref name="Narbonne1998"/> Soft-bodied organisms today almost never fossilise during such events but the presence of widespread microbial mats probably aided preservation by stabilising their impressions in the sediment below.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Scale of preservation===
The rate of cementation of the overlying substrate relative to the rate of decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved. Most disc-shaped fossils decomposed before the overlying sediment was cemented, the ash or sand then slumped in to fill the void, leaving a cast of the underside of the organism.

Conversely, quilted fossils tended to decompose ''after'' the cementation of the overlying sediment; hence their upper surfaces are preserved. Their more resistant nature is reflected in the fact that in rare occasions quilted fossils are found ''within'' storm beds as the high-energy sedimentation did not destroy them as it would have the less-resistant discs. Further, in some cases, the [[bacteria]]l [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of minerals formed a "death mask" creating a mould of the organism.<ref name=Gehling1999b>{{Cite journal

The Ediacaran biota exhibited a vast range of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics. Size ranged from millimetres to metres; complexity from "blob-like" to intricate; rigidity from sturdy and resistant to jelly-soft. Almost all forms of [[symmetry (biology)#Bilateral symmetry|symmetry]] were present.<ref name="Narbonne1998" /> These organisms differed from earlier fossils by displaying an organised, differentiated multicellular construction and centimetre-plus sizes.

These disparate morphologies can be broadly grouped into [[wastebasket taxon|form taxa]]:

==Classification and interpretation==
Classification of the Ediacarans is difficult, and hence a variety of theories exist as to their placement on the tree of life.

[[Martin Glaessner]] proposed in ''The Dawn of Animal Life'' (1984) that the Ediacara biota were recognizable [[crown group]] members of modern phyla, but were unfamiliar because they had yet to evolve the characteristic features we use in modern classification.<ref name=Glaessner1984>{{Cite book

In 1998 [[Mark McMenamin]] claimed that Ediacarans did not possess an [[embryo]]nic stage, and thus could not be animals. He believed that they independently evolved a [[nervous system]] and [[brain]]s, meaning that "the path toward intelligent life was embarked upon more than once on this planet".<ref name=McMenamin1998 />

The link between certain frond-like Ediacarans and sea pens has been thrown into doubt by multiple lines of evidence; chiefly the derived nature of the most frond-like pennatulacean octocorals, their absence from the fossil record before the Tertiary, and the apparent cohesion between segments in Ediacaran frond-like organisms.<ref>Williams, G.C. 1997.

It could be that no special explanation is required: the slow process of evolution simply required 4 billion years to accumulate the necessary adaptations. Indeed, there does seem to be a slow increase in the maximum level of complexity seen over this time, with more and more [[evolution of complexity|complex forms of life evolving]] as time progresses, with traces of earlier semi-complex life such as ''[[Nimbia]]'', found in the {{Ma|610|million year old}} Twitya formation,<ref name=Fedonkin1980>{{Cite journal

The alternative train of thought is that it was simply not advantageous to be large until the appearance of the Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size ''never'' to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.

A primary size-limiting factor is the amount of atmospheric [[oxygen]]. Without a complex [[circulatory system]], low concentrations of oxygen cannot reach the centre of an organism quickly enough to supply its metabolic demand.

On the early Earth, reactive elements such as [[iron]] and [[uranium]] existed in a [[redox|reduced]] form, which would react with any free oxygen produced by [[photosynthesis]]ing organisms. Oxygen would not be able to build up in the [[atmosphere]] until all the iron had rusted (producing [[banded iron formation]]s), and other reactive elements had also been oxidised.

</ref> Potentially, complex life may have evolved before these glaciations, and been wiped out. However, the diversity of life in modern Antarctica has sparked disagreement over whether cold temperatures increase or decrease the rate of evolution.

In early 2008 a team analysed the range of basic body structures ("disparity") of Ediacaran organisms from three different fossil beds: Avalon in Canada, {{ma|575|&nbsp;}}to {{ma|565}}; White Sea in Russia,  {{ma|560|&nbsp;}}to {{ma|550}}; and Nama in Namibia, {{ma|550|&nbsp;}}to {{ma|542}}, immediately before the start of the Cambrian. They found that, while the White Sea assemblage had the most species, there was no significant difference in disparity between the three groups, and concluded that before the beginning of the Avalon timespan these organisms must have gone through their own evolutionary "explosion", which may have been similar to the famous [[Cambrian explosion]] .<ref>{{Cite journal| title=The Avalon Explosion: Evolution of Ediacara Morphospace |date=January 2008 | volume=319| issue=5859 |pages=81<U+2013>84 |

[[Image:Kimberella crop.jpg|thumb|''[[Kimberella]]'' may have had a predatory or grazing lifestyle.]]

===Predation and grazing===
It is suggested that by the Early Cambrian, organisms higher in the [[trophic level|food chain]] caused the microbial mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they destabilised the microbial [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], leading to displacement or detachment of the biota; or that the destruction of the mat destabilised the ecosystem, causing extinctions.

Alternatively, skeletonised animals could have fed directly on the relatively undefended Ediacaran biota.<ref name=McMenamin1998>{{Cite book

However, if the interpretation of the Ediacaran age ''[[Kimberella]]'' as a grazer is correct then this suggests that the biota had already had limited exposure to "predation".<ref name=Fedonkin1997/>

There is however little evidence for any trace fossils in the Ediacaran Period, which may speak against the active grazing theory. Further, the onset of the [[Cambrian]] Period is defined by the appearance of a worldwide trace fossil assemblage, quite distinct from the activity-barren Ediacaran Period.<!-- The first appearance of Trichopedes pedum.

==Assemblages==
Ediacaran-type fossils are recognised globally in 25 localities<ref name=Knoll2006/> and a variety of [[deposition (geology)|depositional]] conditions, and are commonly grouped into three main types, named after typical localities. Each assemblage tends to occupy its own region of morphospace, and after an initial burst of diversification changes little for the rest of its existence.<ref name=Erwin2008/>

===Avalon-type assemblage===

The assemblage is easily dated because it contains many fine ash-beds, which are a good source of [[zircon]]s used in the uranium-lead method of [[radiometric dating]]. These fine-grained ash beds also preserve exquisite detail.

The Ediacara-type assemblage is named after Australia's [[Ediacara Hills]], and consists of fossils preserved in [[facies]] of coastal lagoons and rivers. They are typically found in red gypsiferous and calcareous paleosols formed on loess and flood deposits in an arid cool temperate paleoclimate.<ref name="Retallack2013"/> Most fossils are preserved as imprints in microbial earths,<ref>{{cite conference

The Nama assemblage is best represented in [[Namibia]]. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these organisms represent burrowing organisms,<ref name=UndergroundInNamibia /> while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers.<ref>{{Cite journal

===Significance of assemblages===
In the [[White Sea]] region of Russia, all three assemblage types have been found in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages or temporally distinct [[community (ecology)|communities]]. Since they are globally distributed&nbsp;<U+2013> described on all continents except [[Antarctica]]&nbsp;<U+2013> geographical boundaries do not appear to be a factor;<ref>{{Cite journal

It is most likely that the three assemblages mark organisms adapted to survival in different environments, and that any apparent patterns in diversity or age are in fact an artefact of the few samples that have been discovered&nbsp;<U+2013> the timeline (right) demonstrates the paucity of Ediacaran fossil-bearing assemblages. An analysis of one of the White Sea fossil beds, where the layers cycle from continental seabed to inter-tidal to estuarine and back again a few times, found that a specific set of Ediacaran organisms was associated with each environment.<ref name="Grazhdankin2004"/>

As the Ediacaran biota represent an early stage in multicellular life's history, it is unsurprising that not all possible [[guild (ecology)|modes of life]] are occupied.
It has been estimated that of 92 potentially possible modes of life&nbsp;<U+2013> combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility&nbsp;<U+2014> no more than a dozen are occupied by the end of the Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage.<ref name="Bambach2007">{{Cite journal
