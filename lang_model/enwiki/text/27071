'''''Transformers''''' is a 2007 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film]] based on the [[Transformers (toy line)|''Transformers'' toy line]]. The film, which combines [[computer animation]] with [[live-action]], is directed by [[Michael Bay]], with [[Steven Spielberg]] serving as executive producer. It stars [[Shia LaBeouf]] as [[Witwicky family#Samuel James Witwicky|Sam Witwicky]], a teenager involved in a war between the heroic [[Autobot]]s and the evil [[Decepticon]]s, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery. The Decepticons desire control of the [[AllSpark]], the object that created their robotic race, with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth. [[Megan Fox]], [[Josh Duhamel]], [[Tyrese Gibson]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Anthony Anderson]] and [[John Turturro]] also star, while voice actors [[Peter Cullen]] and [[Hugo Weaving]] voice [[Optimus Prime]] and [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] respectively.

Produced by [[Don Murphy]] and [[Tom DeSanto]], they developed the project in 2003 and DeSanto wrote a [[film treatment|treatment]]. Steven Spielberg came on board the following year, hiring [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]] to write the screenplay. The [[United States Armed Forces]] and [[General Motors]] (GM) loaned vehicles and aircraft during filming, which saved money for the production and added realism to the battle scenes. [[Hasbro]] organized an enormous promotional campaign for the film, making deals with hundreds of companies. This advertising blitz included a [[viral marketing]] campaign, coordinated releases of [[Transformers: Movie Prequel|prequel comic books]], [[Transformers: The Movie toy line|toys]] and books, as well as [[product placement]] deals with GM and [[eBay]].

''Transformers'' was a box office success,<ref name="boxmojo"/> despite mixed critical reaction to the radical redesigns of the characters, and reviews criticizing the focus on the humans at the expense of the robots. It is the forty-third [[List of highest-grossing films|most successful film released]] and the [[2007 in film#Top grossing films|fifth most successful of 2007]], grossing approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]709 million worldwide. The film won four awards from the [[Visual Effects Society]] and was nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s for Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing. A sequel, ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'', was released on June 24, 2009, to negative reviews but was a commercial success and grossed more than its predecessor. A third and final film, ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', was released on June 29, 2011, in [[3-D film|3-D]].

==Plot==
[[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Movie plot|Optimus Prime]], leader of the benevolent [[Autobot]]s, narrates the collapse of the Transformers' home world, [[Cybertron]]. It was destroyed by war between the Autobots and the malevolent [[Decepticons]], lead by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] in his quest to get hold of the [[Allspark#2007 Transformers movie|All Spark]]. The Autobots want to find the All Spark so they can use it to rebuild Cybertron and end the war, while the Decepticons want to use it to defeat the Autobots and take over the universe. Megatron had managed to locate the All Spark on Earth, but crash-landed in the [[Arctic Circle]] and froze in the ice. After stumbling upon his frozen body in 1897, explorer Captain [[Archibald Witwicky]] accidentally activated Megatron's navigational system and his eye glasses were imprinted with the coordinates of the All Spark's location, an incident that left him blind and mentally unstable. Sector 7, a secret government organization created by President [[Herbert Hoover]], discovered the All Spark in the [[Colorado River]] and built the [[Hoover Dam]] around it to mask its energy emissions. The still-frozen Megatron was moved into this facility and was used to advance human technology through [[reverse engineering]].

In the present day, a group of Decepticons composed of [[Blackout (Transformers)|Blackout]], [[Scorponok]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], [[Barricade (Transformers)|Barricade]], [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Brawl (Transformers)|Brawl]]<!--PLEASE NOTE!!, the original release referred to him as "Devastator" not "Brawl"!--> and [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]], have landed on Earth and assumed the disguise of Earth vehicles. Blackout and Scorponok attack the U.S. [[United States Special Operations Command Central|SOCCENT]] forward operations base in [[Qatar]] and try to [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] into the U.S. Military network to find the location of Megatron and the All Spark. Their mission is thwarted when the base staff cuts the network cable connections. While Blackout destroys the rest of the base, Scorponok pursues a small group of survivors, led by Captain William Lennox and Sergeant Robert Epps, who have photographic evidence of the robots. Scorponok is eventually repelled and hides in the sand after the humans manage to call air support and damage his tail. During this battle, the military discovers the only effective weapons against the Decepticons' armor are high-heat [[sabot]] rounds.

After Blackout's failure, Frenzy infiltrates [[Air Force One]] to again hack into the military network, planting a computer virus. He finds the map imprinted on Captain Witwicky's glasses. While [[the Pentagon]] interferes with Frenzy's plan, he finds that Witwicky's descendant [[Witwicky family#Samuel James Witwicky|Sam Witwicky]] intends to sell the glasses on [[eBay]]. Frenzy and Barricade begin tracking Sam's location. Meanwhile, Sam unknowingly buys the Autobot scout [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] (also on Earth disguised as a [[second-generation Chevrolet Camaro#1976|1976 Camaro]]<ref name="making of">{{cite news|title=The Making Of The Transformers Movie|work=Entertainment News International|date=2007-06-15|url=http://enewsi.com/news.php?catid=190&itemid=11213|accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>) as his first car. After Bumblebee helps Sam woo his crush, [[Mikaela Banes]], he leaves at night to transmit a homing signal to the rest of the Autobots. Sam pursues Bumblebee, thinking someone is stealing his car, but is shocked to find his car is actually a giant robot, which he regards as evil as first. Sam is arrested, and in the police station, tries to explain to the police officer what happened, but the apathetic and impassive officer assumes that he is hallucinating under the influence of drugs. When Bumblebee (in car mode) returns the following day, Sam flees, thinking the car is stalking him. While out, Barricade attacks Sam and ferociously interrogates him about his grandfather's glasses. Bumblebee saves Sam and Mikaela and engages Barricade in battle. During the fight, Mikaela severs Frenzy's head, but he disguises himself as her cellphone and hides in her purse. They leave to meet with the rest of the Autobot team <U+2013> Optimus Prime, [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Ironhide]], and [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] <U+2013> who have landed on Earth and taken the forms of Earth vehicles as well. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots return to Sam's home and obtain the glasses; however, agents from Sector 7 arrive and take Sam and Mikaela into custody. The Autobots intervene, but Sector 7 captures Bumblebee and sends Sam and Mikaela away.

Sam and Mikaela are taken to Hoover Dam, as are Lennox and Epps, under Defense Secretary John Keller's orders. Frenzy sends an alert to the other Decepticons and sneaks into the technology system, freeing Megatron from his frozen state. Sam convinces the Sector 7 agents to release Bumblebee so that he can deliver the All Spark to Optimus. Frenzy's hacking has shut down government communications, but Keller and two hackers, Maggie and Glen, manage to establish a signal to the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] to support the Autobot-human convoy that has gone to nearby Mission City to hide the All Spark. The Decepticons attack; Bonecrusher, Frenzy, Jazz, Brawl,<!--Barricade does not die, he is in Dark of the Moon--> and Blackout are all killed during the ensuing battle. Sam, who was instructed to put the All Spark into Optimus's chest if Megatron prevailed (thereby destroying it and Optimus), instead rams the All Spark cube into Megatron's chest. The All Spark disintegrates, and its power kills Megatron. Optimus takes a fragment of the All Spark from Megatron's corpse, but admits that with its destruction, their home world Cybertron cannot be restored. The President orders the closure of Sector 7 and has the body of Megatron and other Decepticons dumped into the [[Laurentian Abyss]]. Lennox and Epps are reunited with their families, and Sam and Mikaela form a relationship. Optimus transmits a message to all surviving Autobots in space, telling them that they have a new home on Earth. During the credits, Starscream escapes into space.
