''Maldroid'' is a [[British Invasion]]-style [[rock band]] based in [[Oakland, California]].

==History==

Lead singer Ryan Divine, born and raised in [[Santa Cruz, California| Santa Cruz]], founded Maldroid in [[March 2006]], hand-picking local musicians had worked with from now defunct local bands Solemite and "[[The K.G.B.]]" (not to be confused with [[Finland| Finnish]] group [[KGB (band)| KGB ]]). The band made its first [[EP]] later that year produced by guitarist Johnny Genius, the other core member.  Their first video, "He Said, She Said," is a combination of simulated live performance, background [[Subway (rail)|subway]] scenes from the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit| BART]] rail system, and [[graphic-novel]] style cartoons hand-animated over the course of several months by Divine.

The single became popular on local [[San Francisco]] [[modern rock]] station [[Live 105]], after which the video went on to win [[Youtube]]'s first-ever music contest, "The Youtube Underground."  That earned them an appearance on [[Good Morning America]] and interest from various [[record labels]]. 

On February 14, 2007, a 5,000-word cover story was published in a local alternative-weekly newspaper chronicling the group's roots, evolution, and rapid rise to become perhaps the first ever indie rock group launched solely on music videos. [http://news.eastbayexpress.com/2007-02-14/news/video-made-the-radio-star] Unlike [[OK Go]], who was already signed to a major label by the time it was boosted to mainstream popularity through its viral music videos, Maldroid experienced music video fame before it had released a single song for sale or played a single live show.

It was announced at the 2007 South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas that Maldroid was signed to a recording contract with the upstart San Francisco record label Fuzz Artists, Inc.

Maldroid will be playing Every Thursday Night In August and September at the Stork Club in Oakland.

==Musical style and influences==
Maldroid styles itself after British Invasion bands from the 60s and "Second British Invasion" bands of the 80s.  They playing straightforward, singable pop music with clear vocals, a strong beat, conventional arrangements (bass, keys, guitar, singers), and clever wordplay.  It is clearly influenced by early music by [[The Beatles]], although the music is harder edged, more personal, yet less experimental than late Beatles.  Another close comparison is [[The Kinks]].  The band also has [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[Indie Rock]] overtones, and pays homage to [[Devo]], [[The Hives]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Beck]], and [[Iggy Pop]].

== Trivia ==
{{trivia}}
* Maldroid's first three videos are all animations created by lead singer Ryan Divine using commonly available [[Personal computer| PC]] software, essentially at no cost.  Their EP was produced at a cost of $50, which the band claims was spent mostly on food and alcohol, at a studio where two band members work.
* The video "He Said She Said" was inspired by [[Take On Me]], a popular [[1985]] song and video by the [[Norway| Norwegian]] band [[a-ha]].  The live portion was surreptitiously filmed on borrowed cameras in abandoned warehouses.
* The "Heck No" video is animated on a [[Lite Brite]] art toy.  In You Can Have It All a video, Ryan Divine takes apart a [[bluescreen]] [[jigsaw puzzle]], which is played backwards. (He is also a jigsaw champion).
* Lead Guitarist Johnny Genius attended [[San Francisco School of the Arts]], is currently attending culinary academy and is in two other bands.
* Bass Player Sean Shippley and Synth Player Prince J were also members of [[PopSmear Records]] band "Soundboy".
