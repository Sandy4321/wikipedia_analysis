'''''Dichelachne crinita ''''', commonly known as the '''longhair plume grass''', is a type of grass found in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and islands of the Pacific Ocean. It is often seen on sandy soils near the sea as well as woodlands. The flowering panicles are open and feathery at maturity. The grass may grow up to 1.5 metres (5 ft) tall. ''Crinita'', the specific epithet, is  derived from Latin (hairy).<ref>Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, ISBN 9780731812110 page 269</ref>

==Taxonomy==
[[Carolus Linnaeus the Younger]] described the longhair plume grass in his ''[[Supplementum Plantarum]]'' in 1781 as  ''Anthoxanthum crinitum''. ''Crinita'' is derived from the verb ''crinio'' "I cover with hair" and refers to the hairy [[panicle]]s. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] gave it its current name in 1853.<ref name=abrs>{{Flora of Australia Online | name = Dichelachne crinita | id = 53303}}</ref> Longhair plumegrass is the common name in Australia,<ref name="APNI">{{APNI | name = ''Dichelachne crinita'' | id = 47764}}</ref> while clovenfoot plumegrass is a name recorded in America.<ref>[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=DICR7]</ref>

==Description==
The longhair plume grass is a tufted [[perennial plant]] which can reach 1.5 m (5 ft) high. The flowers appear in spring.<ref name=floransw>{{NSW Flora Online|genus=Dichelachne |species=crinita|author= S. W. L. Jacobs & K. L. McClay}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The longhair plume grass is native to all states of Australia, New Guinea, Norfolk Island, the Kermadec Islands and New Zealand. It is unclear whether it is native or naturalised on Lord Howe Island.<ref name=abrs/> It grows on sandy or sandstone-based soils.<ref name=floransw/>

Within the Sydney region, it is a component of the Endangered Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub,<ref>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/nature/recoveryFinalEsbs.pdf]</ref> and Shale/sandstone transition forest.<ref>[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/ShaleSandstoneTransitionForestEndComListing.htm]</ref> It is found in grassland to open forest communities, associated with woodland trees such as smooth-barked apple (''[[Angophora costata]]''), Sydney peppermint (''[[Eucalyptus piperita]]''), silvertop ash (''[[Eucalyptus sieberi|E. sieberi]]'') and red bloodwood (''[[Corymbia gummifera]]''), in scrub with coastal banksia (''[[Banksia integrifolia]]'') and broad-leaved apple (''[[Angophora subvelutina]]'').<ref name=Benson2000>{{cite journal|author=Benson, Doug; McDougall, Lyn|year=2005|title= Ecology of Sydney Plant Species Part 10: Monocotyledon families Lemnaceae to Zosteraceae|journal= Cunninghamia|volume= 9|issue=1|pages=16<U+2013>212|url=http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/72522/Cun9Ben016.pdf}}</ref>
