He was a son of [[Hendrik Muller Sz.]], a Rotterdam-based [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[businessman]] and politician, and [[Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel]], member of another prominent Rotterdam based business family.

Muller started his career as a businessman, trading with [[East Africa|East]] and [[West Africa]]. In his mid-twenties he travelled to [[Zanzibar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[South Africa]] for business purposes, but showed himself a keen [[ethnography|ethnographer]] as well, collecting ethnographic [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and writing reports about the societies and people he encountered on his way. In 1890, Muller retired from business for personal reasons, and went to [[Germany]] to study ethnography and geography. He graduated with a Ph.D. dissertation four years later. 

In 1896 he was first appointed [[consul]] and later [[consul general]] for the [[Orange Free State]]. Muller held this position all through the [[Second Boer War]] and his high-profiled performance as European representative for this Boer republic won him considerable fame and notoriety, which lasted all his life. After the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] was signed in 1902 Muller retired to a life of travelling and writing for some years, making Muller a household name with his travelbooks. In 1919 the Dutch government appointed him envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to [[Romania]], and later to [[Czechoslovakia]], where he retired in 1932. As diplomat Muller strongly promoted Dutch business interests, especially in oil and electrotechnics.

Muller was a prolific writer. Over the course of his life he published well over two hundred articles, brochures, and books about his travels through the world, about South Africa and the Boers, and about Dutch foreign policy and diplomacy, apart from a range of other subjects. Muller gathered a large fortune with well appointed private investments. He bequeathed his considerable wealth to a private fund in support of academic research and cultural heritage.

==Biography==
===Early life as businessman===
[[Image:Muller in 1882.jpg|left|thumb|H.P.N. Muller as young businessman travelling in East Africa (1882-1883).]]
Hendrik Pieter Nicolaas Muller was born in [[Rotterdam]] ([[Netherlands]]) on 2 April 1859, as the third child and second son of [[Hendrik Muller Sz.]] and [[Marie Cornelie van Rijckevorsel]]. His father was a successful businessman based in [[Rotterdam]] and trading with [[Africa]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. H.P.N. Muller<U+2019>s maternal grandfather, [[Abram van Rijckevorsel]], was the doyen of the Rotterdam merchant community in the early part of the nineteenth century. Both his father and maternal grandfather were politicians as well, [[liberals]] who staunchly defended the principle of [[free trade]], and both were at one time members of the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]] of the [[States-General of the Netherlands]]. 

Muller<U+2019>s paternal grandfather was a German immigrant to the Netherlands and a [[Mennonite Church in the Netherlands|Doopsgezind]] (Mennonite) minister and professor of [[theology]] in [[Amsterdam]]. The Muller family was fairly prominent in the [[Netherlands]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, with Christian ministers, professors of literature and history, archivists, antiquarian booksellers, statesmen and businessmen in their midst.	

Muller was destined to step into his father<U+2019>s footsteps and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the [[:nl:Hogere Burger School|Hoogere Burger School]] (High School) in [[Rotterdam]], before continuing his education in [[Germany]], at the ''Hohe Real Schule'' in [[Frankfurt-am-Main]], to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Marseilles]]. His first serious job came when his father called him back to [[Rotterdam]] in 1882, to become interim manager of the [[:nl:Handels Compagnie Mozambique|Handels Compagnie Mozambique]] (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in [[Mozambique]]. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to [[East Africa]] and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices.  At the end of his trip he made an extensive tour of [[South Africa]], visiting [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], the [[Orange Free State]], and the [[Cape Colony]]. On his return to [[Rotterdam]] he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted company, now called the [[:nl:Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie|Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie]] (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father<U+2019>s firm, Hendrik Muller & Co., which had important trading interests in [[Liberia]] and elsewhere in [[West Africa]]. 

In the 1880s Muller was active for his businesses, and travelled to the [[Congo Conference]] in [[Berlin]] in 1884, to [[Portugal]] in 1886 and [[North Africa]] in 1889. In the same year he succeeded his father as consul general for [[Liberia]] in the [[Netherlands]], a position he would hold until 1913. After a third business journey to [[Africa]] in 1890, now to [[Liberia]] and the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], for Hendrik Muller & Co., he returned home seriously ill, and  had to convalesce for months. In this period he fell out with his father and younger brother [[Abram Muller]], about both personal and business matters. It was a personal break that would never be healed and with professional repercussions. In 1891 Muller left business for good and embarked on a totally new career.

===Ethnographer and geographer===
Already in the 1880s, Muller had dabbled in [[ethnography]] and writing. On the basis of materials gathered on his journey to [[East Africa]] and [[South Africa]] in 1882/<U+2019>83, he had held public lectures throughout the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch [[Magazine|journals]] and [[newspapers]], and collated these publications into a book titled ''Zuid-Afrika''. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, and an expert on [[South Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of [[ethnography|ethnographic objects]] and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with [[Johannes Fran<U+00E7>ois Snelleman|Joh. F. Snelleman]], curator of the Africa collection in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] (National Museum of Ethnology) in [[Leiden]]. 

Once freed from running the better part of two businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study geography and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] before completing his [[doctorate]] at the [[University of Giessen]] in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis ''Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo'' (''Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo'') was mainly based on secondary material, rather than the materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in [[East Africa]]. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.

===Consul general for the Orange Free State===

[[Image:Muller Toorop drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of Dr. H.P.N. Muller as consul general of the Orange Free State. Artist: [[Jan Toorop]], 1902]]
After his return to the [[Netherlands]], H.P.N. Muller settled down in [[The Hague]], where he was originally only occupied with his consular duties for [[Liberia]], his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the [[Orange Free State]] in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general [[H.A.L. Hamelberg]]. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about [[South Africa]]. After [[H.A.L. Hamelberg|Hamelberg's]] death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as [[consul general]]. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the [[Orange Free State]] and its interests in [[Europe]]. His predecessor [[H.A.L. Hamelberg|Hamelberg]] had not only been [[consul general]], but had on occasion also acted as [[special envoy]] to be able to negotiate [[treaties]] and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as [[special envoy]] and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the [[Orange Free State]] in the [[Universal Postal Union]], the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]], and the [[Geneva Conventions]], and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[Netherlands]]. He also strengthened the consular representation of the [[Orange Free State]] in [[Europe]] and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for [[rinderpest]] and improved methods of [[irrigation]].

In 1898 Muller travelled to [[South Africa]], where he visited [[Cape Town]], the [[Orange Free State]], and the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]]. In [[Pretoria]] he attended the [[inauguration]] of President [[Kruger]] and in [[Bloemfontein]] he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President [[Marthinus Theunis Steyn|M.T. Steyn]] and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President [[Francis William Reitz|F.W. Reitz]], government secretary [[Pieter Jeremias Blignaut|P.J. Blignaut]], and chairman of the [[Volksraad]] [[Cornelius Hermanus Wessels|C.H. Wessels]]. In [[Cape Town]] he had an audience with [[High Commissioner]] [[Alfred Milner|Sir Alfred Milner]].

[[Image:M VA0953.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. H.P.N. Muller as consul general of the Orange Free State, ''c.'' 1899]]
Once back in the [[Netherlands]], the political situation in [[South Africa]] became tense very rapidly, and Muller did all he could to propagate the cause of the [[Boer Republics]] in the press and via diplomatic channels. Once the [[South African War]] broke out in October 1899, Muller set up an elaborate operation to support the cause of the war for the [[Orange Free State]]. He mobilised public support in the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States of America]] and had public gatherings organised. Through his many contacts with the European press Muller saw to it that the Boer cause was extensively covered in the newspapers, usually in his own words, but published in the name of the editor. His office in [[The Hague]] was the hub of diplomatic and consular activity in this period, with several secretaries working continuously on the gathering of information and dealing with correspondence. In the war effort Muller cooperated with the [[:nl:Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond|Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond]] in [[Dordrecht]], the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging in [[Amsterdam]], and of course the diplomatic representative of the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]] in [[Brussels]], Dr. [[Willem Johannes Leyds|W.J. Leyds]]. Originally the relationship between Muller and [[Willem Johannes Leyds|Leyds]] was cordial, but with time it soured and turned into open animosity. Both men were strong personalities with strong convictions. The fact that Muller was only [[consul general]] and [[Willem Johannes Leyds|Leyds]] an accredited diplomat was not helpful either and neither was the fact that <U+2013> at least in Muller<U+2019>s opinion <U+2013> the [[Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]] received much more attention than the [[Orange Free State]]. The first time problems arose in the open was in 1900, when the [[Boer Republics]] sent a joint Special Diplomatic Delegation to Europe and the [[United States]], which was ill-prepared and for which Leyds had very different ideas than Muller.

In 1901 Muller travelled to the [[United States]] himself to mobilise support from President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], especially on behalf of the women and children in the British [[concentration camps]]. He also held public lectures all around the country. While visiting [[Mexico]], news reached Muller about the [[Treaty of Vereeniging|Peace of Vereeniging]], making him jobless. Muller took the opportunity to turn his American journey into an expedition. On his return to the [[Netherlands]] in 1903 he published a book about it. In the years after the end of the [[South African War]] Muller maintained his interest in [[South Africa]] and the [[Afrikaners]], both personally and professionally. In 1904 he supported the [[Steyn family]] when they were in [[Europe]] for the President<U+2019>s recovery of a debilitating illness. Until his death Muller was active for the Algemeen Nederlandsch Verbond and the Nederlandsche Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging.

===Travel through Asia===
[[Image:HPN Muller VA0967.jpg|left|thumb|H.P.N. Muller in the Dutch East Indies, 1907.]]
Between 1907 and 1909 Muller travelled through [[Asia]], a journey that produced several books and articles after his return, including a two-part report of his travels (''Azi<U+00EB> gespiegeld''; Asia mirrored).<ref>A translation of selected chapters from part I was published by [[Carool Kersten]] as ''Dr. Muller's Asian Journey. Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Yunnan (1907-1909)'' (Bangkok: White Lotus 2004).</ref><ref>Spies, '' 'n Nederlander'', 252-262.</ref>. Muller also published a scientific source publication on [[Cambodia]] and the earliest Dutch presence in [[French Indochina]]. The French government rewarded him for it with a knighthood in the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur]] for the latter. The French colony [[Annam (French colony)|Annam]] made Muller a knight in the [[Order of the Dragon of Annam|Order of the Dragon]] for his contributions to the history of Vietnam. 

Muller's Asian trip was comprehensive. He visited [[British India]] and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], [[Burma]], [[Malaysia]] and the [[Philippines]] and [[French Indochina]], travelled extensively through the [[Dutch East Indies]], and returned via [[Japan]], [[Korea]] &ndash; where he had an audience with the last Korean emperor<ref>Muller, ''Azi<U+00EB> gespiegeld'', part I, 369-371.</ref> &ndash;, [[Manchuria]], [[China]], and [[Siberia]].<ref>On the Philippines, Siam, French Indo China, Korea, Manchuria, and Siberia: Muller, ''Azi<U+00EB> gespiegeld'', part I.</ref><ref>On China: Muller, ''Azi<U+00EB> gespiegeld'', part II, 174-286.</ref> Muller's visit to [[Japan]] triggered a lively interest in this country and its economic development potential. Back in the [[Netherlands]] he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly under the auspices of the [[Comit<U+00E9> Nederland-Japan]] (Dutch-Japanese Committee).<ref>Muller, ''Zij en wij''.</ref>

===Dutch government official and diplomat===
In 1914, at the outbreak of [[World War I]], Muller's career took a new turn. The [[Dutch government]] appointed him government commissioner in charge of one of the main Belgian Refugee Camps in the Netherlands. Muller was charged with the transfer of the camp from a make-shift army encampment in [[Oldebroek]] to a proper refugee camp with full provisions in [[Nunspeet]]. He took to the job with great enthusiasm, but resigned a year later, declaring that he had attained the goals he had set himself on his appointment. Actually the resignation came in a cloud of controversy around his person and policies. At the end of World War I the Dutch prime minister did acknowledge the high quality of Muller<U+2019>s work in setting up the camps and bringing and maintaining order and human dignity under very trying circumstances. Apart from his position as member of the Consular Examinations Commission, this position was the only Dutch government appointment Muller held inside the Netherlands. 

From the 1890s onwards, Muller had published with great regularity about the importance of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the [[Netherlands]] in [[international relations|international affairs]]. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of [[Spitsbergen]] ([[Svalbard]]) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the [[Spitsbergen Treaty]].<ref>

In 1919, now already sixty years old, he got the chance to put his preachings on Dutch foreign policy into practice. In that year the Dutch government appointed him [[Diplomatic rank|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to [[Romania]], a country in the throes of political and economic transformation. The Dutch had had important business interests in the country, especially in [[petroleum]]. Muller stayed here until early 1924 when he was appointed envoy to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In [[Prague]] he was also involved in Dutch business affairs, ''inter alia'' looking after the interests of the Dutch electrotechnical firm [[Philips]].

He resigned his post in 1932 after being requested to step back by the Dutch minister of Foreign Affairs, who wished to free some senior diplomatic posts for younger diplomats waiting to be appointed envoy. Muller decided not take his pension, allowing him to keep his title of [[Diplomatic rank|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] until his death.

===Dutch history and heritage===
[[Image:De Witt unveiling.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Unveiling of statue of [[Johan de Witt]] on the Plaats in [[The Hague]] by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] (front); H.P.N. Muller in third group.]]
From an early age Muller was interested in Dutch history, especially in the great national achievements of the Dutch during the centuries. During his lifetime Muller translated his interests in several concrete projects.

[[Image:Johan de Witt-TheHague.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Johan de Witt]] on the Plaats in [[The Hague]] by F.E. Jeltsema.]]
In line with his historical interests he initiated the erection of a statue for the murdered [[Grand Pensionary]] of [[Holland]], [[Johan de Witt]] (1625-1672). The statue was designed and made by the Dutch sculptor [[Frederik Engel Jeltsema]]. The unveiling in [[The Hague]] on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close to the place where De Witt and his brother [[Cornelis de Witt|Cornelis]] were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the socle a text is engraved which - in translation - reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the [[freedom of the seas]], caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.'<ref>[http://www.vriendenvandewitt.nl website Vrienden van De Witt] (Dutch)</ref> Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.

Muller funded the erection of a plaque in honour of the Dutch seventeenth-century [[admiral]] [[Maarten Harpertsz. Tromp]] in the newly-built [[City Hall]] of his birthplace [[Rotterdam]].

===Retirement===
In the years after 1932 Muller travelled a little around [[Europe]] and retired to his house in [[The Hague]]. He remained involved in cultural and academic activities, organised his papers, and kept a keen interest in South African affairs. In the last years of his life he was honoured in several ways, among others with a [[honorary doctorate]] in law from the [[University of South Africa]], a bust in the hall of the Eeufeesgebou of the [[University of the Free State]], with a copy in the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] (National Museum of Ethnology) in [[Leiden]], and an honorary diner party by the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in [[London]]. Without children and never fully reconciled with his family, Muller left almost his complete estate to the [[:nl:Dr. Hendrik Muller<U+2019>s Vaderlandsch Fonds|Dr. Hendrik Muller<U+2019>s Vaderlandsch Fonds]] for the support of academic research and cultural heritage. Finally his health failed more and more and H.P.N. Muller died in his house in [[The Hague]] on 11 August 1941. He was buried in the cemetery of [[:nl:Oud Eik en Duinen|Oud Eik en Duinen]] in [[The Hague]] in a grand ceremony, with the Dutch flag covering the coffin and the [[national anthem]] being played, in defiance of the [[:nl:Nederland in de Tweede Wereldoorlog|German Nazi occupation]] and as a <U+2013> somewhat old-fashioned <U+2013> celebration of Dutch [[cultural identity]].<ref>[http://kranten.kb.nl/Exe/ZyNET.exe/1941_08_15_2_03.txt?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&Client=Koninklijke+Bibliotheek&Index=het%20Centrum%20%281910-1930%29%7Cde%20NRC%20%281910-1930%29%7Chet%20Vaderland%20%281920-1945%29%7Chet%20Volk%20%281910-1920%29&Query=hendrik%20AND%20muller&Time=&EndTime=&SearchMethod=1&TocRestrict=n&Toc=&TocEntry=&QField=Datum%5E%3E19410801%3A%3C19410829%7CEditie%5E&QFieldYear=&QFieldMonth=&QFieldDay=&UseQField=Datum&File=E%3A%5CZYDATA%5CDATA%5CGADH01%5CVADERLAND%5CEXPORT%5CTXT%5C236%5F237%5C1941%5F08%5F15%5F2%5F03.txt&User=anonymous&Password=anonymous&SortMethod=n%7C-&MaximumDocuments=20&FuzzyDegree=0&ImageQuality=r65g4/r65g4/x150y150g16/i360&Display=hpfr&DefSeekPage=f&SearchBack=ZyActionL&Back=ZyActionS&BackDesc=Results%20page&MaximumPages=1&ZyEntry=1&SeekPage=f 'Begrafenis Dr. H.P.N. Muller', Het Vaderland 15 August 1941]</ref> Among the attendants were several former government ministers and high-ranking military officers, university professors, former diplomats, representatives of cultural and scientific organisations, and friends from his South African period and after.
[[Image:Grave of HPN Muller.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Grave of H.P.N. Muller at Oud Eik en Duinen in The Hague.]]

During his lifetime H.P.N. Muller was well respected for his work. He was extensively decorated by almost all the countries he worked for or in, in many cases with the highest distinction. He was made a [[Knight Grand Cross]] in military and civilian orders of [[Portugal]], [[Liberia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Netherlands]], was commander of the French [[Legion of Honour]], and knight in orders of [[Liberia]], [[Order of the Dragon of Annam|Annam]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him.

Although highly-decorated, honoured and well respected for his work, Muller was not an easy person. This shows through in a consistently bad press he received during his lifetime and after, which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character.

==Concise bibliography==
During his life, H.P.N. Muller published well over 200 books, articles, columns, and papers. Many of these - especially his newspaper articles - were published anonymously. Many of the (propaganda) articles he wrote about the [[South African War]] when he was [[consul general]] for the [[Orange Free State]] were published secretly, often under another journalist's or newspaper editor's name, in order to maximise the public relations effect.

This bibliography only lists Muller's main book publications and some key articles.
