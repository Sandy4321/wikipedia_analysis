'''EFF-Austin''' was formed in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]] by [[Steve Jackson]] of [[Steve Jackson Games]] shortly after the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] or EFF was formed. Jackson was pursuing a lawsuit, eventually successful, against the Secret Service with EFF's help, and suggested the formation of an alpha EFF chapter in Austin.  Jackson organized a picnic and stood on a picnic table to sound the call for the new organization.  He recruited a smaller group including [[John Quarterman]], [[Jon Lebkowsky]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Smoot Carl-Mitchell]], [[Lar Kaufman]] and [[Matt Lawrence]] to organize the group and serve on the first Board of Directors. The group formed a Texas corporation for EFF-Austin, and became active in discussions of potential chapters for the national organization.  In January 1992, leaders of several potential chapters met with EFF in [[Atlanta]], and learned that EFF had decided not to become a chapters organization. EFF-Austin continued as a separate organization and was active from 1991 through 1997, when it ceased operations following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ''Reno v. [[ACLU]]'' decision. The organization re-formed in 2001.
