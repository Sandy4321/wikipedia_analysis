'''Black Butte''' is a cluster of overlapping [[lava dome]]s, a parasitic [[satellite cone]] of [[Mount Shasta]].  It is located directly adjacent to [[Interstate 5]] at [[List of exits on Interstate 5|milepost 742]] between the city of [[Mount Shasta, California|Mount Shasta]] and [[Weed, California]].  The highway crosses a {{convert|3917|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} pass, Black Butte Summit, at the western base of the lava domes.  The lava domes were extruded at the foot of the cone of [[Shastina]] following the period of its major eruptions about 9,000<U+2013>10,000 years ago.

A [[United States Forest Service]] [[fire lookout tower]] was built on the summit in the 1930s, but destroyed during the [[Columbus Day Storm of 1962]]. A new lookout was 
built in 1963 and operated until 1973.  The building was moved by helicopter to a new location in 1975 and only the concrete foundation remains today.  A 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) long trail leads to the summit from a [[trailhead]] accessible by [[dirt road]]s off the Everitt Memorial Highway.  The summit boasts an outstanding view of the southwest side of Shasta and Shastina, and on clear days [[Mount McLoughlin]] is easily visible 70&nbsp;miles (113&nbsp;km) to the north in Oregon.
