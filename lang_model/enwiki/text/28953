'''Asii''', also written '''Asioi''', were one of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European tribes]] mentioned in Roman and Greek accounts as responsible for the downfall of the state of [[Bactria]] ''circa'' 140 BCE. These tribes are usually identified as "[[Scythian]]", "[[Saka]]" or [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] peoples.

==Historical sources==
The texts relating to the Asii are very brief. The three main surviving classical sources are those of [[Strabo]], [[Trogus]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]]. Both Trogus' ''Historiae Philippicae'' (as preserved in Justin) and Strabo's ''Geography'' exist in a number of ancient manuscripts containing significant textual variations leading to widely varying translations and interpretations.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

===Trogus===
Trogus wrote his ''Historiae Philppicae'' in Latin. Only his 'Prologues' have survived intact. He mentions three tribes involved in the conquest of Bactria: the Asiani, Sacaraucae and the Tochari, of whom the Sacaraucae were said to have been destroyed. The Asiani are reported as becoming, at some point, rulers over the Tochari, though this text is sometimes translated as the "Asian kings of the Tochari."{{cn|date=November 2013}}

Marcus Junianus Justinus, a late 2nd or 3rd century Roman historian, wrote an ''epitome'' or condensation of Trogus' history. The last datable event recorded by Justin is the recovery of the Roman standards captured by the Parthians in 20 BCE, although Trogus<U+2019> original history may have dealt with events into the first decade of the 1st century CE.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

===Strabo===
Strabo wrote in Greek and completed his ''Geography'' in 23 CE, around the time of Trogus. He mentions four tribes: the Asioi (commonly accepted as the equivalent of the Latin Asii), the Pasianoi, the Tacharoi (or Tokharoi) and the Sakaraukai.{{cn|date=November 2013}}

===Pliny the Elder===

Pliny the Elder wrote his ''Naturalis Historia'' with a brief mention of a people called the ''Asini'': 

{{quote|Pliny mentions as neighbours of the Soseadae the people of the Asini, who are reigning in the city of Bucephela. From these three data; 1) the Tacoraei are neighbours of the Besadae/Sosaeadae; 2) the Asini are the neighbours of the Sosaeadae; 3) The Asiani are kings of the Thocari, it follows that the Asini of Pliny's text are identical with the Asiani, who are the kings of the Tocharians. This implies that<U+2014>at least in the time of Pliny<U+2014>the Kush<U+0101><U+1E47>as were kings of the region between Jhelam and Indus and that Bucephala was one of their cities. It seems that Pliny availed himself of a recent description of this territory and that Ptolemy knew these data too.|<ref>"The Murundas and the ancient trade-route from Taxila to Ujjain." P. H. L.

==Theories on the identification of the Asii==
Many theories have been proposed by historians and other scholars as to their origins, relationships, language, culture, etc., but so far no consensus has emerged. 

It is generally accepted that Trogus' Asiani were probably identical to the Asii of Strabo,<ref>Iaroslav Lebedynsky. (2006). ''Les Saces: Les <U+00AB>Scythes<U+00BB> d'Asie, VIIIe si<U+00E8>cle av. J.-C. <U+2014> IVe si<U+00E8>cle apr. J.-C.'' Editions Errance, Paris. ISBN 2-87772-337-2</ref> perhaps leaving an extra tribe, the 'Pasiani' of Strabo, to account for. 

Some scholars{{who|date=November 2013}} believe that the Asii and the Pasiani were one and the same tribe, with 'Pasiani' a simple mistake for 'Asiani' and just a different form of the name for the Asii. Others{{who|date=November 2013}} believe the 'Pasiani' were a separate tribe, and still others{{who|date=November 2013}} believe that 'Pasiani' is a mistaken form of 'Gasiani'.<ref>"The Y<U+00FC>eh-chih and their migrations."

===Issedones===
The Asii/Asiani may simply be a transcription of the [[Issedones]] of Herodotus. Taishan Yu proposes that Asii were "probably" the dominant tribe of the confederacy of four tribes "from the time that they had settled in the valleys of the [[Ili River|Ili]] and [[Chu River|Chu]]" who later invaded Sogdiana and Bactria. "This would account for their being called collectively "Issedones" by Herodotus." He also states that the "Issedon Scythia and the Issedon Serica took their names from the Issedones."<ref>Taishan Yu. ''A Study of Saka History'', pp. 12, 15, 24, 140. (1998) Sino-Platonic Papers.

===Yuezhi and Wusun===
W. W. Tarn first thought that the Asii were probably one part of the [[Yuezhi]], the other being the [[Tocharians|Tochari]]. However, he later expressed doubts as to this position.<ref>W. W. Tarn.

===Kushans===

{{quote|One of the most important sources of information on nomad migration in Central Asia is Justin's ''Prologue to Pompeius Trogus'' (prologue to book XLII), which states that 'the Asiani are kings of the Tochari and destroyed the Scaraucae' (Reges Tocharorum Asiani interiusque Sakaraucarum). It is possible to conclude from this extract that the Asiani and the Tochari were closely related tribes. What is more, it indicates that the 'Asiani' dominated the 'Tochari' (Reges Tocharorum Asiani). We can identify the Asiani with the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] (von Gutschmidt 1888; Haloun 1937; Bachhofer 1941; Daffina 1967), one of the leading tribes, which subsequently came to power and created a great empire. It is noteworthy that Justin says that the Tochari were ruled by the Asiani, while the Chinese sources identify them as the largest of the five Yuezhi principalities.|Kazim Abdullaev, Nomad Migrations in Central Asia<ref>Kazim Abdullaev (2007).

ISBN 978-0-19-726384-6.</ref>}}

===Alans===

The Asii/Asiani have also been identified with the [[Alans]] <U+2013> i.e. a western Central Asian population, rather than the Yuezhi-Tochari of eastern Bactria <U+2013> from whom the modern [[Ossetians]] derive their name.

With this identification of the Asii-Asiani, the ''Prologues'' seem instead to concern two later distinct periods already disconnected from the time of Eucratides. Moreover, from a geographical point of view, they describe events not related to the eastern, but to the western border of the Graeco-Bactrian kingdom, that is a region which was in close contact with Parthia. Therefore, the ethnonym of the Asii-Asiani should be transferred westwards, that is to a different historical context (the [[Kangju]] area).<ref name="Victor H 2000 p. 92" /><ref>Rapin, Claude (2007).

The Greeks were acquainted both with the Sanskrit forms Risika/Arsika and their Prakrit forms Isi/Isika. The Greek ''Asii'' (Appolodorus) may then represent Prakrit Isi and the Plinian ''Arsi'' the Sanskrit Arsika.
