'''Pupienus''' ({{lang-la|Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus Augustus}};<ref>In [[Classical Latin]], Pupienus' name would be inscribed as MARCVS CLODIVS PVPIENVS MAXIMVS AVGVSTVS.</ref>  born c. 165/170<ref>Michael Grant, ''The Roman emperors: a biographical guide to the rulers of imperial Rome, 31 BC-AD 476'' (1985), pg. 144</ref> <U+2013> 29 July 238), also known as '''Pupienus Maximus''', was [[Roman Emperor]] with [[Balbinus]] for three months in 238, during the [[Year of the Six Emperors]]. The sources for this period are scant, and thus knowledge of the emperor is limited. In most contemporary texts Pupienus is referred by his [[agnomen]] "Maximus" rather than by his [[cognomen]] (family name) Pupienus.

==Origins and early career==
The ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', whose testimony is not to be trusted unreservedly, paints Pupienus as an example of advancement through the [[cursus honorum]] due to military success. It claims he was the son of a [[blacksmith]], was adopted by one Pescennia Marcellina (otherwise unknown), and who started his career as a ''[[Centurion|Centurio]]'' ''[[primus pilus]]'' before becoming a [[Tribunus Militum]], and then a [[Praetor]].<ref>Historia Augusta, ''Maximus and Balbinus'', 5:1-8</ref> He was in fact part of the aristocracy, albeit a minor one, and possibly quite recently.<ref>John Drinkwater, ''Maximinus to Diocletian and the crisis'', in ''The Cambridge ancient history: The crisis of empire, A.D. 193-337'' (ed. Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Averil Cameron) (2005), pg. 32</ref> Hailing from the [[Etruria|Etruscan]] city of [[Volterra]],<ref>Michel Christol, ''L'empire romain du IIIe si<U+00E8>cle: histoire politique'' (1997), pg. 114</ref> it has been speculated that Pupienus was the son of [[Marcus Pupienus Maximus]], a [[Roman Senate|Senator]] who was the first member of his family to enter the Senate, and wife Clodia Pulchra.<ref>Christian Settipani, ''Continuit<U+00E9> gentilice et continuit<U+00E9> familiale dans les familles s<U+00E9>natoriales romaines <U+00E0> l'<U+00E9>poque imp<U+00E9>riale: mythe et r<U+00E9>alit<U+00E9>'' (2000), pg. 120 <U+2013> Note that this speculation is based upon onomastic similarities and probabilities</ref>

Pupienus<U+2019>s career was impressive, serving a number of important posts during the reign of the [[Severan dynasty]] throughout the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. This included assignment as [[Proconsul]] of the senatorial [[propraetor]]ial [[Roman provinces|provinces]] of [[Bithynia et Pontus]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]], and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].<ref name="McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''">McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''</ref> He was later assigned as [[Legatus Augusti pro praetore|imperial legate]] to one of the [[Germania|German]] provinces, most probably after his first [[Roman consul|suffect consulship]], circa 207 AD.<ref name="McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''"/> During his time as governor, he was quite popular and scored military victories over the [[Sarmatian]]s and German tribes.

In 234, during the last years of [[Severus Alexander]]<U+2019>s reign, he was installed as Consul for the second time. In that same year he was also appointed [[Praefectus Urbi|Urban Prefect]] of Rome and gained a reputation for severity, to the extent that he became unpopular with the Roman mob.<ref>Christopher S. Mackay, ''Ancient Rome: a military and political history'' (2004), pg. 268</ref>

==Reign==
When the [[Gordian I]] and his [[Gordian II|son]] were proclaimed Emperors in Africa, the Senate appointed a committee of twenty men, including the elderly Senator Pupienus, to co-ordinate operations against Maximinus until the arrival of the Gordians.<ref>Potter, pg. 169</ref> On the news of the Gordians' defeat and deaths, however, the Senate met in closed session in the Temple of [[Jupiter Capitolinus]] and voted for two members of the committee to be installed as co-emperors <U+2013> Pupienus and Balbinus.<ref name="McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''"/> Unlike the situation in 161 with [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]], both emperors were elected as ''[[Pontifex Maximus|pontifices maximi]]'', chief priests of the official cults. 

According to Edward Gibbon (drawing on the narratives of Herodian and the ''Historia Augusta''), the choice was sensible, as:

<blockquote>the mind of Maximus [Pupienus] was formed in a rougher mould [than that of Balbinus]. By his valour and abilities he had raised himself from the meanest origin to the first employments of the state and army. His victories over the Sarmatians and the Germans, the austerity of his life, and the rigid impartiality of his justice whilst he was prefect of the city, commanded the esteem of a people whose affections were engaged in favour of the more amiable Balbinus. The two colleagues had both been consul... and, since the one was sixty and the other seventy-four years old, they had both attained the full maturity of age and experience.<ref>''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', vol. I, p. 225, Edward Gibbon (The Online Library of Liberty). [http://oll.libertyfund.org/files/1365/Gibbon_0214.01.pdf].</ref></blockquote>

However, factions within the Senate who had hoped to profit from the accession of the Gordians manipulated the people and the [[Praetorian Guard]] to agitate for the elevation of [[Gordian III]] as their imperial colleague.<ref>John Drinkwater, ''Maximinus to Diocletian and the crisis'', in ''The Cambridge ancient history: The crisis of empire, A.D. 193-337'' (ed. Alan K. Bowman, Peter Garnsey, Averil Cameron) (2005), pgs. 33</ref> Leaving his senior colleague Balbinus in charge of the civil administration at Rome, sometime during late April Pupienus marched to [[Ravenna]], where he oversaw the campaign against Maximinus, recruiting German auxiliary troops who had served under him whilst he was in Germania;<ref name="McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''"/> after the latter was assassinated by his soldiers just outside [[Aquileia]] he despatched both Maximinus's troops and his own back to their provinces (along with a considerable donative) and returned to Rome with his newly acquired German bodyguard.<ref>McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''; Southern, pg. 67</ref>

Balbinus, in the meantime, had failed to keep public order in the capital. The sources suggest that Balbinus suspected Pupienus of using his newly acquired German bodyguard to supplant him, and they were soon living in different parts of the Imperial palace.,<ref>Potter, pg. 171; Canduci, pgs. 64-65</ref> This meant that they were at the mercy of disaffected elements in the Praetorians, who resented serving under Senate-appointed emperors, and now plotted to kill them.<ref>Michael Grant, ''The collapse and recovery of the Roman Empire'' (1999), pgs. 5-6</ref> Pupienus, becoming aware of the threat, begged Balbinus to call for the German bodyguard. Balbinus, believing that this news was part of a plot by Pupienus to have him assassinated, refused, and the two began to argue just as the Praetorians burst into the room. Both emperors were seized and dragged back to the Praetorian barracks where they were tortured and brutally hacked to death.<ref>McMahon, ''Pupienus (238 A.D.) and Balbinus (238 A.D.)''; Canduci, pgs. 64-65</ref>

==Family==
Pupienus had at least three children. His eldest son, [[Tiberius Clodius Pupienus Pulcher Maximus]], who was a Consul Suffectus c. 235 AD, and also a [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] of the town of [[Tivoli, Italy|Tibur]] outside Rome.<ref>Ronald Syme, ''Historia Augusta papers'' (1983), pg. 194</ref> His youngest son, [[Marcus Pupienus Africanus Maximus]], was Consul Ordinarius in 236 AD as colleague of the Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax]]. The run of consulships in the family, across the reigns of Severus Alexander and Maximinus Thrax, show that the family was influential and in high favour. Pupienus also had a daughter, named Pupiena Sextia Paulina Cethegilla, wife of [[Marcus Ulpius Eubiotus Leurus]].
