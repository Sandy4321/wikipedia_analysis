'''British Israelism''' (sometimes called '''Anglo-Israelism''') is a [[Christian]] [[theology]] (though not accepted as mainstream Christianity), based on the premise that many early [[British people]], [[European ethnic groups|European]]s and/or their royal families were direct lineal descendants of the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]] and in some cases of the Tribe of [[Judah]].  Proponents assert that favor with God is based on one's racial status as an Israelite [http://www.kinsmanredeemer.com/OurStoryHisStory.htm] and because they are the true Israelites only White people [http://blog.ucoy.org/2007/12/10/my-white-kinsmen.aspx] can enjoy God's favor.  [http://wzus.ask.com/r?t=p&d=us&s=a&c=a&l=dir&o=0&ld=3101&sv=0a30050e&ip=4bd4cda7&id=6D1C50174259F59BA106CBD4E521080F&q=%2B%22british+Israel%22+%2B%22true+israelites%22+%2B%22white+people%22+%2Brace+&p=1&qs=167&ac=4&g=0844EZ81F3syLj&en=te&io=7&ep=&eo=&b=alg&bc=&br=&tp=d&ec=10&pt=Challenging%3A%20Christian%20Identity&ex=&url=&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.therefinersfire.org%2Fchristian_identity.htm]  [http://human-nature.com/nibbs/01/ogilvie.html] [http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Christian_Identity.asp]

The theory was greatly expanded and promoted to justify the break of the [[Church of England]] from the authority of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] under [[King Henry VIII]], by British theologians claiming that the English were among the [[Lost Tribes of Israel]].  The theory played a significant historical role in the establishment of a church separate from Rome.

Due to the [[Restorationist]] tendencies of the adherents, there has rarely been a central head, recognized leadership, or organizational structure to the movement.  This has led to a diverse set of professions and beliefs ancillary to the genealogical claims.  The ancillary doctrines held by some can often be contradictory to those held by others.  In a similar fashion to [[Judaism]] and to a lesser degree [[Islam]] the central theme revolves around the genetic connection of the believers with Biblical characters such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Most strands of British Israelism agree that large numbers of the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]] were captured and enslaved by [[Sargon II]], king of [[Assyria]], on the fall of [[Samaria]] in [[721 BC]],<ref> II Kings chap. 17 & 18 </ref> but somehow migrated to Northern Europe, the British Isles, and with European colonization eventually North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere around the globe.

==Legend and folklore==

Many early legends abound in ancient British folklore suggesting a link to the Holy Land.  These include but are not limited to:

# The story that [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (Jesus' alleged uncle) traveled to [[Cornwall]] sometime after [[Christ]]'s crucifixion and established an early [[Christian]] community,<ref> ''Traditions of Glastonbury'' by E. Raymond Capt Artisan Publishers </ref> 
# Suggestions that the [[Stone of Scone]] might be Jacob's Pillar or [[Jacob's Pillow Stone]], 
# Legends that the Israelite prophet Jeremiah may have been the "Olam Fadlah" of Celtic lore,
# The legends of the ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' connecting Britain to the Mediterranian and Middle East and detailing early [[Welsh people|Welsh]]/[[Brython]]ic genealogies.
# The coming of [[Brutus of Troy]] (''Britis'') to [[Great Britain]] after the burning of [[Troy]] and his genealogy leading to the Israelite tribe of Benjamin,
# The [[Matter of  Britain]] detailing the Arthurian Legend.
# The claims by [[Henry VIII]] to be descended from [[King Arthur]],<ref>Francine Roche ([[1 January]] [[2007]]). [http://www.sfsu.edu/~medieval/Volume6/roche.html The Battle of the Books: An Attack on Nationalism.] Accessed [[2007-05-02]].</ref> who legend has it was the eighth generation from Joseph of Aramathea.<ref> ''Traditions of Glastonbury'' by E. Raymond Capt Artisan Publishers </ref>
# The claim that [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] visited Britain.

Each of these legends have been incorporated into the British Israel belief.  Regardless of the accuracy of the details of these legends, each of them are evidence of a belief by some British people and those descended from them for hundreds of years in a tangible genetic connection between the people of Britain and the people of the Holy land.

Critics contend that much of these stories are apocryphal and were created and planted later to help justify England's rejection of the [[Vatican]]'s authority in Rome.

==The Saka==
The key component of British Israelism is their representation of the migrations of the Lost Tribes of Israel.  They often suggest that the [[Behistun Inscription]] has provided an invaluable missing link. [[George Rawlinson]], [[Sir Henry Rawlinson]]'s younger brother, connected the Saka/Gimiri of the Behistun Inscription with deported [[Israelites]]:

{{Cquote|We have reasonable grounds for regarding the Gimirri, or Cimmerians, who first appeared on the confines of Assyria and Media in the seventh century B.C., and the Sacae of the Behistun Rock, nearly two centuries later, as identical with the Beth-Khumree of Samaria, or the Ten Tribes of the [[House of Israel]].<ref>[[George Rawlinson]], note in his translation of ''History of Herodotus'', Book VII, p. 378</ref>}}

[[Image:jehu-on-black-obelisk.jpg|thumb|300px|Jehu kneeling at the feet of [[Shalmaneser III]] on the [[Black Obelisk]].]]

The inscription connects the people known in [[Old Persian]] and [[Elamite]] as [[Saka]], [[Sacae]] or [[Scythian]] with the people known in [[Babylonian]] as Gimirri or [[Cimmerian]]. This is important because the Assyrians referred to the Northern [[Kingdom of Israel]] in their records as the "House of Khumri", named after Israel's King Omri of the 8th century BCE. Phonetically "Khumri", "Omri", and "Gimiri" are similar.<ref>E. Raymond Capt, ''Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets'' Artisan Pub, 1985 ISBN 0-934666-15-6</ref>

{{Cquote|It should be made clear from the start that the terms '[[Cimmerian]]' and '[[Scythian]]' were interchangeable: in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] the name Iskuzai (Asguzai) occurs only exceptionally. Gimirrai (Gamir) was the normal designation for 'Cimmerians' as well as 'Scythians' in Akkadian.<ref>Maurits Nanning Van Loon. "Urartian Art. Its Distinctive Traits in the Light of New Excavations", Istanbul, 1966. p. 16</ref>}}

The archeologist [[E. Raymond Capt]] asserted that there were similarities between King [[Jehu]]'s pointed Saka style headdress and that of the captive Saka king seen to the far right on the Behistun Inscription as shown in the photo of the [[Black Obelisk]] to the right.<ref>E. Raymond Capt, ''Missing Links Discovered in Assyrian Tablets'' Artisan Pub, 1985 ISBN 0-934666-15-6</ref> King Jehu of Israel was a successor to King [[Omri]] of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

== General overview ==

Adherents of British Israelism assert that the Saka-Scythians migrated north and west after  the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] King [[Cyrus the Great]] conquered the city of [[Babylon]].  History suggests that these Scythians were forced further north and west by migrating / invading [[Sarmatians]].  The Sarmatians were also called <U+201C>Scythians<U+201D> by the Greeks.  To differentiate between the two, [[Herodotus]] suggests that the former <U+201C>Scythians<U+201D> were called "Germain Scythians" (meaning "True Scythian"), while the Sarmatians were still merely called <U+201C>Scythians<U+201D>.  This theory suggests the term "Germain Scythian" is synonymous with "Germanii". or in modern times "Germanic" or "German".  

The ancient scholars [[Bede]] and [[Tacitus]] both agree<ref> ''English Constitutional History from the Teutonic Conquest to The Present Time'' by Thomas Pitt Taswell-Langmead B.C.L., OXON., Stanhope prizeman in the University, 1866; Vinerian scholar in the University, 1867; and late professor of Constitutional Law and History, University College, London.  Third Edition revised throughout, with notes and appendices, by C. H. E. Carmichael, M.A., OXON., Taylorian Scholar in the University, 1862; corresponding member of the Society of Comparative Legislation, Paris.  Published by London: Stevens and Haynes, Bell Yard, Temple Bar.  Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, and Co., The Riverside Press, Cambridge. MDCCCLXXXVI  Chapter 1, </ref> that before the time of Christ German and Teutonic tribes began to migrate to the British Isles forcing the early Britons to the western portion of Britain.  The earliest of these Germanic settlers were the Angles and Jutes beginning before the time of Christ, followed by the "Great Saxon Invasion" (between 450 and 600 AD), and culminating with the "Danish Conquest" (787-1070 AD).  This Germanic element came to Britain from the same region in which the Scythians had settled in Northern Europe, and brought with them laws, and customs remarkably similar to the ancient Israelites.<ref> ''La constitution de la Marche parait dans Tacite '' see also Tac. Germ. c. vii.  Compare Tacitus' description of the Saxon "Mark" system with the ownership and societal definitions contained in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Deut. </ref>  Some of these customs, laws and traditions were codified by [[Alfred the Great]] in his famous "Dooms" (see [[Doom book|Doom Book]] ), which were a nearly direct quote from Exodus chapters 20 through 23.  According to [[William Blackstone]] in his famous ''"Commentaries on the Laws of England",'' the Dooms and these ancient customs became the cornerstone of British [[Common Law]].<ref> ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' by Willian Blackstone First Edition 1765 - 1769 Vol 1 section 3</ref>

Late nineteenth-century Celtic language scholar [[John Rhys]] suggested {{Cquote|...the (Celtic) Kymry were for some time indifferently called Cambria or Cumbria, the Welsh word on which they are based being, as now written, Cymru ... and is there pronounced nearly as an Englishman would treat it if spelled Kumry or KUMRI.'].<ref>''Early Celtic Britain'' pg 142. by Sir [[John Rhys]]  </ref>}} Rhys argued that both [[Celts]] and the Scythians came from an area south-east of the [[Black Sea]], and migrated westward to the coast of Europe, comparing the name of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] for themselves, ''Cymry'', with the name of the Cimmerians "Kumri".  He suggested the names ''Iberia'' for [[Spain]], and ''Hibernia'' for [[Ireland]] were connected to a variation of "Hebrew" and that this was evidenced in philology. <ref> ''Early Celtic Britain'' pg 150 & 162-3</ref>  
  
Some researchers{{Who|date=July 2007}} suggest that the burial customs of the Scythians and [[Viking]]s also show similarities to ancient Israelites, for which many have argued a common origin in support of British Israelism.<ref> ''They Came A Viking'' E. Raymond Capt M.A., A.I.A.,F.S.A. Scot. </ref>

==Theology involves claim of racial lineage==

As with Judaism, British Israelism asserts theologically-related claims of a genetic link to the early Israelites.  As such, it is based on a genealogical construct.  This belief is typically confined to the geo-political status or the prophetical identity of the nation, not to the individual's superiority or salvation status with God.  

Due to the disorganized structure of the movement, other elements of belief and key doctrines may be embraced by individual adherents. These elements occasionally take on extreme forms, as exemplified by the [[Christian Identity]] Movement with some of its historic roots in British-Israelism, but the core belief of British Israelism is that the Anglo-Saxon peoples of Britain and Northern Europe have a direct genetic connection to the Ancient Israelites mentioned in the Bible.

The British Israel belief is a true theology or religious belief, in some quarters having well-developed religious concepts.  British Israel, like the [[Christian Identity]] movement, denies the role of [[Jesus Christ]] in providing forgiveness of sins through his [[substitutionary atonement]] through his death on the cross, and asserts instead an elaborate set of beliefs based purely on racial identity alone.  In this theology, those who are the Lost Tribe(s) of Israel enjoy God's favor simply on account of their race -- usually equated with being of the White race -- and will go to heaven because of their racial identity alone.  In their view, other races and people groups do not and can never obtain God's favor because they are not Israelites, and are doomed to hell on account of their racial identity.

==Growth and spread of belief==

Although British-Israelists will cite various ancient manuscripts to show an ancient origin for British Israelism, the belief appears to have gained momentum since the [[English Revolution]] and especially during the "[[Restorationist]]" movement (late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries). [[John Sadler (1615-1674)|John Sadler]] published ''The Rights of the Kingdom'' in 1649. However it was in the late 1700s during a religious climate of [[Millenarianism]] that it became a distinct ideology thanks to the preaching and writings of two men, [[Richard Brothers]] and [[John Wilson]]. Other books from this period detailing this theory were Ezra Stiles' ''[[The United States elevated to Glory and Honor]]'', published in 1783 and Richard Brothers' ''[[A Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times]]'', published in 1794.  Also cited as an original work is Rev. [[John Wilson]]'s ''Our Israelitish Origins'' which was originally published during the [[1840s]].  Brothers was certainly the first of the two to begin to expound his version of British-Israelism, but many have suggested he lacked credibility due to his alleged mental illness and extreme tendencies.  Wilson, on the other hand, developed the idea using [[Scripture]] and history combined with logic and reason.

Wilson<U+2019>s ideas were to be refined and new ideas developed, well into the second half of the nineteenth century.  Wilson had already begun to spread his message by public lecture, but no formal organizations or movement was formed under his leadership.  British Israelism was seen as amusing to some, fascinating to others, but it did not seem to develop any sort of organizational structure until the late half of the nineteenth century at the hands of, [[Edward Hine]] and [[Edward Wheeler Bird]].

In 1919 the [[British-Israel-World Federation]] was founded in London near Buckingham Palace.  During this time many prominent British citizens patronized this organization.  Perhaps one of the most notable of these members being the Prime Minister of New Zealand at the time [[William Massey]].  This organization continues to this day with its main headquarters located in Bishop Auckland in Co. Durham.  It continues to maintain local chapters throughout the British Isles and throughout the world.

==Modern adherents==

The late Professor [[Roger Rusk]] (1906 - 1994), brother of former U.S. Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], was a prominent teacher of British Israelism.  He spent 13 years as a public school teacher, and 28 years as a professor at the [[University of Tennessee]], where he held the position as Emeritus Professor of Physics.  He was also a member of American Physical Society and the Tennessee Academy of Science.

Pastor Arnold Murray, of the Shepherd<U+2019>s Chapel, a registered non-profit organization in the State of [[Arkansas]], also embraces the British Israel belief.  His teaching is broadcast regularly via satellite.

Some groups that follow the original teaching of [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] adhere to this doctrine.  Armstrong was the founder and Pastor-General of the Radio Church of God from its foundation around 1934, through its re-naming in 1968 as the [[Worldwide Church of God]], until a week before his death in 1986. 
Armstrong in chapter 5 of his ''Mystery of Ages'' (1985), "The Assyrians settled in central Europe, and the Germans, undoubtedly, are, in part, the descendents of the ancient Assyrians." (p. 183).  In this, Armstrong draws upon the opinions of [[Herman L. Hoeh]], published in his 1963 ''Compendium of World History''.<ref>vol. 2, ch. 1: "If the Germans admitted to themselves and the world who they really are, all the world would recognize in Imperial Germany the reconstituted Assyrian Empire &mdash; once the terror of all the civilized world!" [http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/hhc2ch01.htm]</ref>
On the fourth page of his book, ''The United States and Britain in Prophecy'' (1980), Armstrong maintained that this theory is a master key to understanding Biblical end-time prophecy. The current [[Worldwide Church of God]] has abandoned this doctrine and offers a detailed explanation of the doctrine's origin and abandonment at their official website. <ref>[http://www.wcg.org/lit/prophecy/anglo/howanglo.htm How Anglo-Israelism Entered Seventh-day Churches of God]. 1999 Worldwide Church of God explanation of the historical origin of British Israelism doctrine within its fellowship. Accessed July 19, 2007.</ref>

In Britain, the theology of British Israelism has been taught by a few small [[Pentecostal]] churches including the (now-defunct) [[Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship]], an early offshoot of the [[Elim Pentecostal Church]] (which, however, does not hold to the British Israel doctrine).  In London the Orange Street Congregational Church<ref>[http://www.orange-street-church.org Orange Street Congregational Church], retrieved [[19 May]] [[2007]].</ref> also teaches a form of British Israelism. In Australia, the [[Christian Revival Crusade]], founded by Leo Harris once but no longer teaches this theology.  However, its prominent offshoot the [[Revival Centres International]] and its own various offshoots continue to teach the doctrine.

Some have suggested that the references made in the Scottish [[Declaration of Arbroath]] to the ancient nation of Israel imply that the authors of the Declaration believed in a racial connection between the Scots and the ancient Israelites.
  
Due to the expansive nature of the British Empire, believers in British Israelism spread worldwide but is most prevalent in the Commonwealth nations including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Belize.  Nations with large populations of British and Northern European descendants such as the United States, South Africa, Ireland, and Argentina also contain groups of believers in British Israelism.  Although no comprehensive database exists, it is now possible that there are more who embrace this belief outside of Britain, than within it.


==Genetic Testing and DNA Evidence ==
The British Israel theology depends upon a direct genetic link of Britons with ancient Israel in the Middle East.  However, modern DNA studies on the [[Y chromosome|Y-Chromosome]] of Jews worldwide such as the [[Human Genome Project]] have determined that modern Jews share common semitic (Middle Eastern) origins dating back to a common genetic source 3000 years ago in the Middle East, presumably Israel, but that Europeans and particularly Britons share no such genetic connection to ancient Israel.  While Jews are genetically tied to the region of Israel, they are sharply divergent genetically from Britons and other Europeans.  Thus, on a genetic level from DNA analyses of the populations there appears to be no link between Britons and the Middle East or ancient Israel.

A study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that "The results support the hypothesis that the paternal gene pools of Jewish communities from Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East descended from a common Middle Eastern ancestral population, and suggest that most Jewish communities have remained relatively isolated from neighboring non-Jewish communities during and after the Diaspora."
[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769]

Many modern Jews with the surname [[Cohen (surname)|Cohen]], which is associated with the historical [[Kohen|Kohenim]], share a common ancestor in Israel dating back approximately 3000 years, 1700 years older than the [[Khazar]] conversion to Judaism.  This result is consistent for all Jewish populations no matter where they are found around the world. <ref name="hammer">{{cite journal| title=Y Chromosomes of Jewish Priests| first=M. F.| last=Hammer| coauthors=Karl Skorecki, Sara Selig, Shraga Blazer, Bruce Rappaport, Robert Bradman, Neil Bradman, P.J. Waburton, Monic Ismajlowicz | journal=NATURE, Volume 385| month=January 2| year=1997}}</ref> 
[http://www.familytreedna.com/nature97385.html]

"The results accord with Jewish history and tradition and refute theories like those holding that Jewish communities consist mostly of converts from other faiths, or that they are descended from the Khazars, a medieval Turkish tribe that adopted Judaism."
[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D02E0D71338F93AA35756C0A9669C8B63] 
<ref name="New York Times">{{cite journal| title=Y Chromosome Bears Witness to Story of the Jewish Diaspora | journal=New York Times | month=May 9 | year=2000}}</ref> 

Moreover, "The analysis provides genetic witness that these communities have, to a remarkable extent, retained their biological identity separate from their host populations," evidence of relatively little intermarriage or conversion into Judaism over the centuries."  ''Id.''  And "Another finding, paradoxical but unsurprising, is that by the yardstick of the Y chromosome, the world's Jewish communities closely resemble not only each other but also Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese, suggesting that all are descended from a common ancestral population that inhabited the Middle East some four thousand years ago. ''Id. (Emphasis added.)''

==Critics of The British Israel Theory==

Critics of this theory point out that British Israelism misrepresents Biblical and historical accounts in numerous respects, and state that the Assyrian chronicles of the time claim that only a small number of Israelites were deported from Israel to Babylon and Assyria.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}. 

First, critics assert that the entire theory is speculation or fictional history, lacking in any factual support.  In keeping with the public relations goals of the [[Church of England]] during its break with Rome, the theory presents the mere possibility of a connection with Israel, but presents mere possibility as fact.

Second, whereas a hallmark of Israelite culture was a fierce belief in a single [[monotheistic]] God, the history and culture of the British Isles shows a radically different cultural heritage.  Religion in that time period in Britain involved [[polytheism]] and the worship of aspects of nature in addition to a diverse assortment of gods.  The religion of the British Isles prior to the arrival of Christianity -- by a known pathway that did not involve Israelites -- consisted of [[polytheism]] mainly under the [[Druids]].   

Thus, historically, Britain and Europe from the relevant time period shows no evidence of any Israelite culture or influence.   The culture and religion of the British Isles is sharply in conflict with the core beliefs of the Israelites.  

Third, Europe was already populated with "White" or proto-Germanic tribes long before the Israelites left their land in Israel.  Thus, the source of European peoples, including the British, cannot be from the Israelites, who could have arrived (if ever) much later in time than the British peoples who were already in Europe.

Fourth, the theory depends heavily upon the concept of Israelites being "deported" upon the conquest of the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, aimed at suggesting a mass migration.

The Bible, however, states in 2 Kings 17 that the Israelites were conquered and enslaved, and carried off far to the East as slaves in the [[Assyrian]] and [[Babylonian]] Empires.  Thus, not only were the Israelites not free to wander about Europe, but they were last seen much farther to the East than assumed by British Israelism.

Fifth, the Bible explicitly records the mass replacement of Israelites in the Northern Kingdom with Assyrians in 2 Kings 17:24.   Thus, the people identified by British Israel followers as Samaritan or Israelite were actually the Assyrians who conquered and replaced the Israelites in the region that took on the name Samaria.  References to those from the region of Samaria would be to the Assyrian occupiers who took over the land in 721 BC -- not to Israelites.

Sixth, the British Israel theory leaves large gaps unexplained, specifically how the Israelites got free from captivity in what is today Iraq and Iran, how they migrated over a thousand miles <i>en masse</i> on foot, what happened to the pre-existing population of Europe, and why the pre-existing European populations are also counted as Israelites by this theory.

The geographical challenges of the theory are never explained, in that the Bible places the Israelites' last known position deep within a hostile empire unwilling to allow the Israelite slaves to escape.  Travel of escaping Israelites through the entire length of the [[Assyrian]] Empire to the West would seem highly improbable as opposed to escape -- if any such escape occurred -- to the North into what is today Southern Russia or to the East toward [[China]].  Thus an Israelite origin for Britain would be far less probable than an Israelite origin for the [[Russia]]n people directly to the North of the Israelites' last known location.

Rather than asserting that a handful of escaping Israelites found their way to Britain to live among the pre-existing British population, the theory asserts that the entire British people consists of Israelites who migrated ''en masse'' across all of Europe and across the English Channel.  Although the technology unquestionably existed in 721 BC to transport a shipload of people from the European continent to the British Isles, no capability existed at the time to transport a mass migration of escaped Israelite slaves from Assyria across the English Channel.

Seventh, critics question the authenticity of the ancient sources cited by those espousing British Israelism.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}  These critics claim that these sources were invented as propaganda to validate the Church of England as a religious authority independent from the Vatican and the Roman Catholic Church.  They suggest that British Israelism should be classified as a new religious movement. 

Eighth, nearly all the reasons given for the theory consist of coincidences in less than a dozen place names, out of tens of thousands of place names in Britain, and that the alleged similarities between Britain and Israel are not close at all. 
It is asserted that the theory ignores the existence of thousands of [[language]]s at the time, in which re-occurrences of relatively short and simple words and [[phonetic]] groupings is to be expected as a natural occurrence.  The mere combination of vocal sounds by human beings is a product of language, and does not show any link between one culture and another.

Ninth, critics reject alleged references to ancient Israel in the Scottish [[Declaration of Arbroath]].  They suggest the Declaration does not claim descent from the people of Israel.  Critics insist the reference is making a comparison between, on the one hand, the Scots making an exodus across a sea from the barbarism of Spain, and entering their own "promised land" of Scotland; and on the other hand, the Biblical exodus of the Israelites from Egypt across a sea into the promised land of Israel. These critics assert such a comparison could be based equally well on the Scots' seeing themselves as a Christian nation and therefore chosen of God, as on the supposition that Scots actually believed they were literally descended from the Israelites.

Some have suggested that British Israelism belongs in the category of [[Pseudohistory]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}  

Critics responding to the British-Israel rejectionism, are quick to point out contrary evidence, and the idea that city names in England such as "Yarmouth" arose without any real historical connection to Ancient Israel should be dismissed as lacking basis.  For example, the article from the Scotsman entitled "One in five Scots has blood tie to ancient Iraq" should cast serious doubt to accepting spurious DNA patterns as justification for utterly dismissing other more obvious geographic and cultural evidence.[http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=51752005]  

Advocates of the theory assert that that the Bible refers to Judah as being of darker skin, and the story of the patriarch Judah himself having a child by a Canaanite woman may also explain genetic differences between modern Jews and the British people while also explaining similarity to modern day Arab people.  

Critics of the theory reject any such interpretation of scripture and find no color distinction among the twelve tribes of Judah.  They assert that all of the Israelites were semitic and thus of the same color and ethnicity as the Canaanites.  Judah's great-grandfather Abraham had been called out by God from among the Chaldeans.  The Chaldeans and Canaanites were of similar color and ethnic background.

Advocates of the theory further respond that the idea of ancient British people as having a religious system entirely unknown to ancient biblical writers should be dismissed considering that the river "Aven" shares the same name as a principal region of idolatrous practices mentioned in various bible prophecies.  Some descendants of the inhabitants of the same region even have family traditions which say that the real name for the same river is actually not even "Aven" at all, but in fact "Beith Muin Ailm," dismissing connection with some of the more widespread ancient customs which are looked down on as unfavorable for the aforementioned reason.
