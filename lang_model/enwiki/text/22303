'''Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk''' ([[1473]] <U+2013> [[25 August]] [[1554]]), was a prominent [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor politician]].

He was the son of [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk]], and Elizabeth Tilney. Until 1524 he was styled [[Earl of Surrey]].  Norfolk first married [[Anne of York]], daughter of [[Edward IV of England]] and [[Elizabeth Woodville]].  Following her death in 1511, he married Elizabeth Stafford, daughter of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]] and Alianore Percy. The marriage was unhappy, allegedly because the duke showed off about his betrayal with his wife's maid, Bess Holland, and savagely beat her when she protested. Their eldest son was the poet [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]].  

Thomas Howard succeeded his younger brother [[Edward Howard (admiral)|Edward]] as [[Lord High Admiral]] in 1513.  On his father's death in 1524 he inherited the [[Duke of Norfolk|dukedom of Norfolk]] and was named [[Lord High Treasurer]] and [[Earl Marshal]], making Howard one of the most premier nobles in the kingdom. He distinguished himself many times in battle, and was an able soldier.

His power increased somewhat after his niece, [[Anne Boleyn]], became [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s mistress, sometime around 1527.  However, their relationship was fraught with difficulty since Anne found her uncle to be selfish and untrustworthy. Although they were political allies throughout the late 1520s, Norfolk once complained that Anne used words to him "that one would not use to a dog." She was crowned queen in 1533, and was probably influential in securing the marriage of Norfolk's daughter Mary to the king's illegitimate son, [[Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond]]. 

Queen Anne's religious and political vision was more radical than Norfolk's, and their relationship deteriorated throughout 1535 and 1536. Norfolk was perhaps behind the King's affair with Anne's cousin, Margaret Shelton, another of the duke's numerous nieces. Putting his own security before family loyalties, he presided over Queen Anne's trial in 1536, giving a death sentence despite her probable innocence. The next day, he condemned to death his nephew, Anne's brother [[George Boleyn]] for the crime of incest with his own sister, the Queen.

Regardless of this tragedy within his family, he used another of his nieces, the teenaged [[Catherine Howard]] to strengthen his power at court by orchestrating an affair between her and the now elderly king.  He used Henry's subsequent marriage to Catherine as an opportunity to depose of his long-term enemy, [[Thomas Cromwell]] who was beheaded in 1540. Queen Catherine's reign was a short one, however, since [[Thomas Cranmer]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, discovered that she was already secretly betrothed before her marriage to Henry and had been extremely indiscreet since. Catherine was beheaded in February [[1542]], and numerous other Howards were imprisoned in the Tower - including the duke's step-mother, brother, two sisters-in-law and numerous servants.

Queen [[Catherine Howard]]'s execution was the point at which he fell out of favour<!--Not 'favor', unless you can produce evidence he was an American citizen--> with King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], despite Norfolk's desperate efforts to heal the rift. There were even rumours that Norfolk was to be beheaded in [[1547]], although Henry died the day before the warrant was to be signed. Norfolk's eldest son, [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], had also fallen foul of Henry and had been beheaded on the king's orders in [[1546]].

Following the accession of Henry's son, [[Edward VI of England]], Norfolk was imprisoned on suspicion of [[treason]] and his dukedom forfeit, but he was released by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in 1553, the Howards being an important [[Catholic]] family, and the dukedom was restored. The Duke showed his gratitude by leading the forces sent to put down the rebellion of Sir [[Thomas Wyatt]], who had protested against the Queen's forthcoming marriage to a Spanish prince, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and had planned to put Anne Boleyn's daughter, the future [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] on the throne in Mary's place. The result of Norfolk's suppression of the Wyatt Rebellion was Princess Elizabeth's imprisonment in the Tower (although there was not enough evidence to convict her on treason, since she clearly had not been party to the rebels' precise intentions) and the execution of the Queen's cousin [[Lady Jane Grey]]. Norfolk, himself, died not long after the Wyatt Rebellion. He was succeeded by his grandson, [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]]. The 4th Duke, also a Catholic, was executed on Elizabeth's orders for illegally plotting to marry [[Mary Queen of Scots]].

Thomas Howard's tomb is situated in [[St Michael the Archangel, Framlingham|Framlingham Church, Suffolk]]. It is possibly the best preserved example of ornate stonework in Europe.
