'''Rancho Camulos''', now known as '''Rancho Camulos Museum''', is a [[ranch]] located {{convert|2.2|mi|km|1}} east of [[Piru, California]]. It was the home of [[Ygnacio del Valle]], an ''[[alcalde]]'' of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and member of the [[California State Assembly]]. The ranch was known as the '''Home of Ramona''' because it was widely believed to have been the setting of the popular 1884 novel ''[[Ramona]]'' by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]]. The novel helped in raising awareness about the [[Californio]] lifestyle and "romanticizing of the mission and rancho era of [[History of California to 1899|California history]]."<ref name="nhlsum"/>

The {{convert|1800|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} working ranch is a prime example of an early [[Ranchos of California|California rancho]] in its original rural setting. It was the source of the first commercially grown [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s in what is now [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]],<ref name="history"/> and is one of the few remaining [[citrus]] growers in [[Southern California]].

[[California State Route 126|State Route 126]] bisects the property, with most of the main buildings located south of the highway, and a few buildings on the north. The main [[adobe]] is one of the few extant [[Spanish Colonial style|Spanish Colonial]] buildings left in the state. Most of the other buildings are done in [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] or [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]], both of which are derivatives of the former.

Rancho Camulos is designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and is also a [[California Historical Landmark]].  Many of the buildings and grounds are open to the public as a [[museum]] of this period in California history.

==History==
[[Image:Rancho Camulos aerial view 1888.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the rancho in 1888, with vineyards on the left and the [[Santa Clara River]] in the background.]]
Originally a [[Tataviam]] village named Kamulus (meaning "[[juniper]]"<ref name="latimes">{{cite news | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/times111101.htm | title=Del Valle Family Played a Starring Role in Early California | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Cecilia | last=Rasmussen | date=November 11, 2001 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref>), the area was used by [[Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa<U+00F1>a]] for growing crops and as a grazing area for livestock as early as 1804. The population of this relatively isolated area (only traversed by the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]), as recorded by [[William Edward Petty Hartnell]] during his inspection of the mission, was 416 in 1839.<ref name="nrhp3">{{cite web | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/camulos-nrhp3.htm | title=Rancho Camulos: National Register of Historic Places Nomination | first=Judith P. | last=Triem | coauthors=Stone, Mitch | publisher=San Buenaventura Research Associates | format=significance | accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref> It was included in the {{convert|48612|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} [[Rancho San Francisco]] granted to Del Valle's father, [[Antonio del Valle]], administrator of Mission San Fernando, by Governor [[Juan B. Alvarado]] on January 22, 1839, after the secularization of the [[Spanish missions in California|missions]].

After Antonio's death in 1841, Ygnacio inherited [[Rancho San Francisco]], but this was challenged in court by his father's second wife. Nevertheless, by 1853 he constructed a four-room [[adobe]] house and a [[corral]] at Camulos. By 1857, the land title dispute was settled, with Ygnacio getting the western portion and the remainder was split among Antonio's children and his second wife. He purchased back some of the other portions from his family as well as the neighboring [[Rancho Temescal]] to the north, and began [[livestock]] operations on the expanded area. However, Del Valle and his family did not live on the ranch initially, instead settling in house on what is now [[Olvera Street]] in Los Angeles. The Del Valle family did not move back to Camulos, which he had expanded, until 1861. During this time, the ranch was overseen by Jos<U+00E9> Antonio Salazar, Ygnacio's [[majordomo (domestic staff)|majordomo]]. Thus, despite its close association with ''Ramona'' and [[Alta California|Mexican California]], the house was constructed after California statehood and the family never lived there under Mexican rule.

In the 1860s, a [[drought]] forced Del Valle to sell off much of his land, but Camulos not only survived, but thrived.<ref name="history">{{cite web | url=http://ranchocamulos.org/History/index.htm | title=Historical Overview | publisher=Rancho Camulos Museum | accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> By the time of his death in 1880, the house had expanded to twenty rooms and the compound had become a self-sustaining ranch, complete with a brick [[winery]], [[chapel]], [[barn]] and workers' housing. Records indicate that in 1870 the ranch was largest [[vintner]] in the area.<ref name="history"/> A [[stagecoach]] line opened in 1874 and in 1887, [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] ran a rail line past the ranch, including a depot at Camulos, ending the ranch's isolation.

In 1908, the Del Valle Company was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] by Ygnacio's children, but by 1924, the property was sold to August R<U+00FC>bel, a native of [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]]. Upon its sale, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' lamented,
{{cquote|An era in the history of California closed yesterday. The Del Valles of Camulos bade farewell to the homestead where they have lived in successive generations since Antonio del Valle. It was the passing of the old regime. They are said to be the last of the old Spanish families who held in unbroken succession to the ancestral acres.<ref>''Los Angeles Times'', August 11, 1924</ref>}}

R<U+00FC>bel continued operating the ranch in the same manner as the Del Valles, employing many of same workers. He had served in the [[American Field Service]] during [[World War I]] and when [[World War II]] broke out, he volunteered for active duty again. However, he died while serving in [[Tunisia]] in 1943. After his death, his wife Mary married a man named Edwin Burger, who was not as interested in maintaining the rancho. After Mary's death in 1968, Burger closed the ranch entirely, and the buildings and grounds were left untended for years. R<U+00FC>bel's heirs regained control of the property after the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]], which had damaged a number of buildings on the rancho.

The R<U+00FC>bel family restored commercial citrus production and set about repairing the earthquake damage. They successfully lobbied to have Camulos listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 2000, it was further designated a National Historic Landmark.<ref name="nhlsum"/><ref name="nrhpinv2">{{citation|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NHLS/Text/96001137.pdf|title=National Historic Landmark Nomination: Rancho Camulos / Camulos Ranch, Del Valle Ranch, Camulos|date=June 26, 1996 |author=Judy Triem, Mitch Stone, Edna E.

==Agricultural development==
Del Valle acquired his first [[Valencia orange]] seedlings in 1857 from his friend [[William Wolfskill]]. The fruit from these trees was the first to be commercially grown in what is now Ventura County, although this was a relatively small scale because the crops had to be taken by wagon to Los Angeles. A Southern Pacific line opened in 1876 seventeen miles (27&nbsp;km) to the east in [[Saugus, Santa Clarita, California|Saugus]], providing a more convenient form of transport.

However, the primary agricultural product from Rancho Camulos was [[wine]]. Ninety acres (360,000 m<U+00B2>) of [[vineyard]]s were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and [[brandy|brandies]] were known throughout Los Angeles and [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].<ref name="nrhp3"/> In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]], with 45 tons (40,900&nbsp;kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US gallons (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US gallons (3,000 L) of brandy.<ref name="nrhp3"/> In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced [[almond]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[wheat]], [[maize|corn]] and [[barley]]. [[Rose]] petals grown at Camulos were shipped to [[Europe]] to make [[perfume]].<ref name="sunset">{{cite journal | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_6_211/ai_111354269 | title=More than just our home | journal=Sunset | month=October | year=2003 | first=Peter | last=Fish | accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref>

Over the years, the vineyards were replaced by other fruits. Today, about {{convert|600|acre|km2|1}} are under cultivation, most of it oranges, but [[lemon]]s, [[grapefruit]], and [[avocado]]s are grown too. This makes Camulos a rare instance of a surviving citrus operation. During the years 1920&ndash;45, the citrus industry experienced a period of great growth, and, in contrast to the natural desert-like conditions of the area, images of "citrus belts" help cement the image of Southern California as an idyllic farmland in the nation's eye.<ref name="nrhp2">{{cite web | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/camulos-nrhp2.htm | title=Rancho Camulos: National Register of Historic Places Nomination | first=Judith P. | last=Triem | coauthors=Stone, Mitch | publisher=San Buenaventura Research Associates | format=narrative description | accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref> After World War II, urban development eliminated much of the Southern California citrus production, with the notable exception of the Santa Clara River Valley.

==''Ramona''==
''[[Ramona]]'', published in 1884, was based in part of some of the experiences that [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson only spent two hours on the ranch and did not meet with Ysabel del Valle, and yet she had a keen eye for details, many of which made it into the book. For example, the altar cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended; in the story, Margarita accidentally tears the altar cloth and Ramona resews it together.<ref name="delyser70">DeLyser, p. 70</ref> The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism,<ref name="latimes"/> which happened to coincide with the opening of [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad lines in Southern California.<ref name="rcramona"/>

With all of the interest generated by the book, a number of communities declared that they were the setting for the novel in order to cash in on the boom, most notably [[Rancho Guajome Adobe|Rancho Guajome]] in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], where Jackson had also visited prior to the book's publication.<ref name="scvhs">{{cite web | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/hs3001.htm | title="Home of Ramona: Cover" | publisher=[[Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society]] | accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> However, the location of the fictional Moreno Ranch, "midway in the valley [between lands] to the east and west, which had once belonged to the Missions of San Fernando and San Bonaventura{{sic}}"<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2802 | title=Ramona | first=Helen Hunt | last=Jackson | authorlink=Helen Hunt Jackson | year=1884}}</ref> corresponds to the location of Rancho Camulos, and the physical description of some of the buildings on the fictional ranch accurately describe actual buildings at Camulos.<ref name="rcramona">{{cite web | url=http://ranchocamulos.org/Ramona/index.htm | title=The Ramona Story | publisher=Rancho Camulos Museum | accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> On the other hand, relative to the other locations in the novel (Ramona's having been married in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and Alessandro's family being from the [[Temecula, California|Temecula]] area), Camulos seems too distant to be the real location.<ref>DeLyser, p. 89</ref> Unfortunately, Jackson died in 1885, never having publicly disclosed what locations the book was based on. Historians today are unsure whether Moreno Ranch actually represented a real location.<ref name="myth">{{cite news | title=Myth of Ramona revived in Ventura | url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/sg103098d.htm | first=Leon | last=Worden | publisher=The Signal | date=October 30, 1998 | accessdate=2007-04-13}}</ref>

[[Image:Camulos postcard 1913.jpg|thumb|Postcard from 1906, where the rancho is called the "Home of Ramona"]]
Nevertheless, by 1886, the ranch was already considered the setting of the novel. Edward Roberts published an article entitled, "Ramona's Home: A Visit to the Camulos Ranch, and to the Scenes Described by 'H.H.'" in the May 13, 1886 edition of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Significantly, he was one of the first to publish an account that blended fact and fiction. The inclusion of his article as an [[Addendum#Books|appendix]] to later versions of the novel only served to cement that association.<ref name="delyser70"/>

The first book solely devoted to ''Ramona'' and the ranch was published in 1888 by [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]], a close friend of the Del Valles<ref name="rcramona"/> and who had fallen in love with the teenage Susana Carmen (nicknamed "Susanita") del Valle.<ref name="latimes"/> Lummis took photographs of the buildings and published them in his own book, ''Home of Ramona: Photographs of Camulos, the fine old Spanish Estate Described by Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson as the Home of "Ramona"''.<ref name="scvhs"/> He made it clear that the Del Valles were nothing like the fictional Morenos, who treated Ramona poorly, but he too would mix fact with fiction with such statements as, "[the [[verandah|veranda]]] is about a hundred feet in length and runs from the door of Father Salvierderra's room to that of Ramona's room."<ref>Lummis (1888), as quoted in DeLyser, p. 74</ref>

Lummis's goal was to discourage the novel's association with other properties, as was [[Adam Clark Vroman]]'s ''Ramona Illustrated: The Genesis of the Story of Ramona'', which compared photographs of the rancho's buildings and environs with text from the novel, as well as photographs from competing locations. [[George Wharton James]]'s 1909 ''Through Ramona's Country'' declared that Camulos was the "avowed and accepted home of the heroine."<ref>{{cite book | title=Through Ramona's Country | first=George Wharton | last=James | year=1909 | publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] | page=107 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ikNIAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=through+ramona%27s+country#PPA107,M1}}</ref> 

Despite the lack of easy access to the ranch and any lodging in the area, tourists flocked to it, and the 1887 establishment of the Southern Pacific line only served to increase that number, with the railroad featuring the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish it from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors, but by October 1888, it was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed upon his mother to stop being so hospitable.<ref>DeLyser, p. 77</ref> The tourists themselves would also be quite a nuisance, and uncouth visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.<ref>DeLyser, p. 79</ref> 

Naturally, the name Camulos became so tied to the novel that many people began to use it instead of the original "Moreno Ranch" when referring to the novel. An 1897 play based on the book was called, "Ramona, or the Bells of Camulos". In [[Virginia Calhoun]]'s 1905 stage adaptation, characters in the play called the ranch Camulos as well.<ref>DeLyser, p. 80</ref>

Given the general belief that Camulos was indeed the original setting, [[D. W. Griffith]] shot portions of his [[Ramona (1910 film)|1910 silent film]] at the rancho, using the chapel, the adobe and patio, and the nearby mountains as backdrops. Paintings and photographs by noted artists such as Adam Clark Vroman, [[Henry Chapman Ford]], and [[Alexander Harmer]] of the rancho also illustrated later versions of the novel.

[[Image:Home of Ramona brand.jpg|thumb|Home of Ramona branding label]]
Although tourism brought much difficulty to the Del Valles, they were not above capitalizing upon their newfound fame themselves, [[brand]]ing their wine and oranges the "Home of Ramona Brand",<ref name="latimes"/> with their label using the same view of the veranda that had been popularized in postcards. One Tataviam servant girl apparently also made quite a bit of money by pretending to be the real Ramona and charging tourists for a photograph.<ref>DeLyser, p. 82</ref>

Tourists continued to arrive even after the SP relocated their main line through the [[Santa Susana Pass]] in 1903. Two daily trains made stops at Camulos until the service was discontinued in the 1940s and tourism by automobile became commonplace at this time. After the R<U+00FC>bels took ownership in 1924, they continued to welcome visitors in small numbers, converting the second floor of the winery into a small museum with artifacts from the Del Valle family.

==Grounds==
[[Image:Camulos map.svg|thumb|Map of the main buildings of Rancho Camulos (map not to scale)]]
There are fifteen buildings open to the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They are mostly built in [[Spanish Colonial Style architecture|Spanish Colonial]] or [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] styles (the latter is derived from the former), but later buildings were done in differing [[architectural style]]s, more representing the period in which they were built. [[Landscaping]] features such as [[lawn]]s, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch. 

The main adobe, also called the Ygnacio del Valle adobe, is a 10,000 square foot (929&nbsp;m<U+00B2>), twenty-room, U-shaped structure. When initially constructed in 1853, it was an L-shaped four-room house connected with an external ''corredor'' (as opposed to an interior [[hallway]]), as is typical of the Spanish Colonial style. It is unusual for its time period because around this time, the [[Monterey Colonial|Monterey]] style was in vogue, as is evidenced by contemporaneous buildings in Santa Barbara.<ref name="nrhp3"/> [[Los Alamos Ranch House]] in Santa Barbara County, and [[Rancho Guajome Adobe]] and [[Las Flores Adobe]] in San Diego County, all National Historic Landmarks, are built in a similar vein.

The house expanded in several phases. In 1861 before the Del Valle family moved here permanently three additional rooms were added as well as a free-standing ''cocina'' (kitchen). A basement was installed under the new rooms as well. In the 1870s, another wing was added perpendicular to the 1861 attachment. Finally some time after 1895, one more room was added to the new wing, as well as a [[breezeway]] to the kitchen, completing the current shape. Further remodeling done after this time was to the interior only.

The basement of the house initially served as the [[wine storage]] area, but in 1867, a one-and-a-half-story [[brick]] winery was constructed. After 1900, when wine grapes were no longer grown commercially, this building served as a storage room. R<U+00FC>bel later converted it to a museum for ''Ramona'' visitors, complete with Del Valle family artifacts. Currently it is used for farm equipment and automobile storage.

[[File:Rancho Camulos black walnut.jpg|thumb|left|California Black Walnut tree]]
To the west of the main house is a large [[California Black Walnut]] tree that was most likely planted by Juventino del Valle in the 1860s. It measures {{convert|25|ft|m|1}} in circumference and its branches spread out almost half an acre (2,000 m<U+00B2>). It is believed to be the largest Black Walnut tree in the area.<ref name="history"/>

The wooden [[chapel]] was constructed around 1867, replacing a makeshift chapel that had been set up in 1861. After the secularization of the [[Spanish missions in California|missions]], this chapel became known as the "lost mission",<ref name="latimes"/> the only place of worship between Mission San Fernando and [[Mission San Buenaventura]]. Directly to the northwest of the chapel is a bell structure containing two bells on a freestanding frame, which were used to call worshipers to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. These were cast at [[Kodiak, Alaska]], and one had previously been used at Mission San Fernando. A third bell was removed by one of the Del Valle daughters and is missing.

The exact dates of construction of the barn, gas station, and bunkhouse are unknown, but the [[American Craftsman]] style of architecture indicates it was between 1910 to 1916.<ref name="nrhp2"/> The barn is located to the northwest of the living quarters, in the main work area. The gas station and bunkhouse are not depicted on the map.

The small adobe, next to the highway, was built by Nachito del Valle. This [[Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture|Spanish Colonial Revial]] house was constructed around 1920 and was damaged severely in the 1994 earthquake. After its reconstruction, it will serve as the museum's visitor center.

[[File:Rancho Camulos visitor center.jpg|thumb|500px|center|The small adobe that now serves as the visitor center.]]
The schoolhouse, constructed in 1930, was the last to be built on the property. It was built by R<U+00FC>bel for his and his bookkeeper's families and designed to match the main adobe.

There are few buildings left on the north side of the highway. The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific [[saltbox]]-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887. A [[train station|train depot]] and [[post office]] both used to exist, but have been torn down. Finally, three farmworkers' [[bungalow]]s, built by the Del Valle family in 1916, sit west of the section house.
