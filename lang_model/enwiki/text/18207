'''Rail transport in Christchurch''', the largest city in [[New Zealand]]<U+2019>s South Island, consists of two main trunk railway lines intersecting in the suburb of Addington, carrying mainly long-haul freight traffic but also a couple of long distance tourist-orientated passenger services.  These two lines are collectively known as the [[South Island Main Trunk]] Line.  There is also a heritage line at the [[Ferrymead Heritage Park|Ferrymead Historic Park]] that is operated with steam, electric and diesel motive power hauling tourist-orientated services.

The port at Lyttelton is a significant destination for rail freight traffic, particularly for coal from the west coast transported over the [[Midland Line]].  Much of the freight transported by rail through [[Christchurch]] is not actually ultimately destined for Christchurch.

== History ==

For the first century of its existence, the role of the railways in Christchurch was to connect the port at Lyttelton to the productive areas around Christchurch on the Canterbury Plains.  A network of branch lines connected these areas to the [[Main South Line]] and [[Main North Line]] which provided access to the port via the Lyttelton rail tunnel, enabling farm supplies to be delivered, and food crops, wool, meat and livestock to be shipped to market.  From the 1930s, rail faced increasing competition from road transport, leading to the piecemeal closure of the branch line network up to the 1960s.

=== Notable People ===


==== William Sefton Moorhouse (1825-1881) ====

:''Main article: [[William Sefton Moorhouse]]''
William Sefton Moorhouse, Superintendent of the Canterbury Province from 1857-1863 and 1866-1868, was a significant advocate for the development of the railways in Christchurch, and was involved in several relevant and notable events, including the opening of the [[Ferrymead Railway]], the opening of the [[Lyttelton rail tunnel]] and the development of the Canterbury Great Southern Railway (Main South Line).

==== Edward Dobson (1816-1908) ====

:''Main article: [[Edward Dobson]]''
Edward Dobson, Provincial Engineer for the Canterbury Province from 1854-1868, was responsible for designing and overseeing the construction of many important public works.  He designed a system of railways for the province, and by the time he retired, the Canterbury Great Southern Railway had reached Lyttelton and advanced as far south as the Selwyn River.

=== Lines ===

:''See also: [[Canterbury Provincial Railways]]''
Railway lines in Christchurch were at first constructed by the Canterbury Provincial Council to a gauge of {{5ft3in}} due to the availability of rolling stock and motive power from Australia using this gauge, with these lines reaching as far south as Rakaia (in June 1873) and as far north as Amberley (in February 1876).

Control over the railways passed to the Colonial Government following abolition of the provinces on [[1 November]] [[1876]], and all lines were subsequently re-gauged to the new national standard of {{3ft6in}}.

==== Ferrymead Railway ====

:''Main article: [[Ferrymead Railway]]''
The first railway to open in Christchurch was the Ferrymead railway, linking the province<U+2019>s main port at the small settlement of Ferrymead with Christchurch, over a distance of 7 km.  With the opening of the Lyttelton rail tunnel in 1867, Ferrymead lost its importance and the railway was thus closed, having outlived its usefulness.  The Ferrymead Railway holds the distinction of being the first public railway in New Zealand to both open and close.

==== Main South Line ====

:''Main article: [[Main South Line]]''
The Main South Line was constructed to link the port at Lyttelton to Christchurch and to agricultural areas in the Selwyn District.  Construction work ceased while work on the Lyttelton Tunnel proceeded, and did not restart until the Colonial Government became involved.  Once under central government control, the line was deemed a high-priority public work and construction re-commenced on extending the line south towards Dunedin.

==== Main North Line ====

:''Main article: [[Main North Line]]''
The Main North Line was built to serve many purposes: to provide suburban passenger services to Christchurch; transport rural settlers and their produce from agricultural areas to the north of Christchurch; eventually provide a link to the areas of Malborough, Nelson and the West Coast.  For many years debate raged as to the best route for the railway to connect with Marlborough, with two lines extending north from Waipara.  Eventually the coastal route was chosen and the Cheviot Branch Railway was extended north to meet the line from Picton at Kaikoura in 1945.

==== Little River Branch ====

:''Main article: [[Little River Branch]]''
The Little River Branch line, connecting with the Southbridge Branch at Lincoln Junction, was originally intended to reach Akaroa but only made it as far as Little River.  It was built to access one of only two major stands of timber at the time.

==== Southbridge Branch ====

:''Main article: [[Southbridge Branch]]''
The Southbridge Branch was originally built to connect rich grain producing areas on the southern Canterbury Plains with Christchurch and connected with the Main South Line in Christchurch at Hornby.  Now, only a small portion of the line remains to serve industrial interests in the Hornby / Sockburn area of Christchurch and is known as the Hornby Industrial Line.

==== Oxford Branch ====

:''Main article: [[Oxford Branch]]''
The Oxford Branch line was constructed to connect the town of Rangiora to agricultural areas to the west.  The line originally connected with the Midland Line at Sheffield (Malvern) and was intended to have been the northern section of a proposed [[Canterbury Interior Main Line|Canterbury Interior Line]].  The section between Sheffield and Oxford closed in 1930, with the remainder closed in 1959.

==== Eyreton Branch ====

:''Main article: [[Eyreton Branch]]''
The Eyreton Branch line was constructed at the behest of parochial interests in the town of Kaiapoi, and connected the town to farming districts to the west.  In an attempt to make it profitable, considering its proximity to the Oxford Branch, it was connected to the Oxford Branch and effectively served as a shortcut for local traffic between Oxford and Christchurch until the connection with the Oxford Branch was closed in 1931.  It was closed beyond Wetheral in 1954 (where it served a flour mill) and closed completely in 1965.

=== Operations ===

Up to the 1950s, much of the freight traffic in Canterbury involved services between rural areas and the major centres and ports.  Manufactured imports were distributed mainly from Christchurch and Dunedin, with agricultural produce exported from Port Chalmers, Oamaru, Timaru and Lyttelton.  The South Island Main Trunk connected the major centres to the branch lines rather than handling long-haul traffic.  Since the 1950s, with the decline in the branch line network, the role of the South Island Main Trunk has changed with it now handling predominantly long-haul freight, a change brought about in part by the containerisation of freight handling and the inter-island ferries.

Since the opening of the Ferrymead Railway, passenger services had operated in Christchurch to various termini, including Ferrymead, Lyttelton, Burnham, Whitecliffs, Springfield, Little River, Southbridge and Rangiora.  Some of these services were of the country mixed train variety, where passenger carriages were attached to freight trains, and these generally operated where passenger only trains could not be justified given the patronage.  Such trains were operated out of Christchurch to destinations including Little River, Southbridge and Springfield.  The services from Christchurch out to Lyttelton and Rangiora were operated with locomotive-hauled passenger only trains.  From 1926 to 1934, a battery electric railcar operated passenger services between Christchurch and Little River.  Occasional special or excursion trains operated out of Christchurch to take passengers to picnics, race meetings or other social functions.

Following the success of the electrification of the section of the Midland Line between Arthur<U+2019>s Pass and Otira, it was decided in 1925 to introduce electrification in Christchurch on the line out to Lyttelton.  On [[14 February]] [[1929]], the electrified line was opened using a 1.5 kV DC system, with an electrical substation at Woolston.  This was originally intended to be the first stage of a larger plan for Christchurch passenger services.  Six new Ec class electric locomotives operated passenger services between Christchurch and Lyttelton, until reaching the end of their working lives in 1970, with the last electric train service running on [[19 September]] [[1970]].  With the withdrawal from service of the Ec locomotives, the electrification was removed as the cost of purchasing replacement locomotives and maintaining the electric infrastructure could not be justified.  The Electric Traction Group based at the Ferrymead Historic Park has preserved and returned to operational status locomotive Ec7.

Suburban passenger services in Christchurch were eventually cancelled due to lack of patronage.  With the opening of the Lyttelton road tunnel in 1964, patronage of the passenger rail services out to Lyttelton slowly declined to the point were it was remarked that the number of passengers using the trains could easily be accommodated on a bus.  This soon became the case, with the Christchurch to Lyttelton services ended on [[28 February]] [[1972]].  The Christchurch to Rangiora services were likewise cancelled four years later in 1976.

=== Facilities ===


==== Railway Stations ====

:''Main article: [[List of Christchurch railway stations]]''
There is only one passenger railway station in operation in Christchurch, that being the Christchurch station at the junction of the Main South Line and Main North Line in the suburb of Addington.  Most of the Christchurch railway stations closed following the loss of the suburban passenger services, though a few have remained as freight-only hubs in industrial areas.  Some buildings and other amenities from closed stations remain, most notably the station buildings for the second Christchurch station, Lyttelton station and Papanui station are still in situ.  Of most of the closed stations, no obvious signs remain.

==== Addington Railway Workshops ====

:''Main article: [[Addington Workshops]]''
The Addington Railway Workshops were a major New Zealand Railways facility for the manufacture and maintenance of rolling stock.  Opened in 1880, they continued to serve until deemed surplus to requirements and closed in 1990.  Today, the Tower Junction Shopping Centre and Christchurch railway station occupy the site, though the original water tower used by the workshops in the days of steam remains in situ.

== Today ==

Freight is the mainstay of rail traffic in Christchurch, with no suburban passenger services and two long-distance passenger services.  Rail freight handling has been centralised at the Middleton freight terminal which opened in 1998.  Industrial areas in Sockburn and Woolston also serve as rail freight hubs.  Prior to the opening of the Middleton freight terminal, freight was shunted between several sites along the Main South Line through Christchurch.

Opportunities for providing inter-modal services are being considered at expanding industrial areas in Islington, Rolleston and Southbrook, with possibilities also being considered in the Marsh/Shands and Chaneys areas.

According to Environment Canterbury, Christchurch geography and public transport usage patterns mean that public transport is currently best served with a bus based system.  However, in anticipation of future growth, they are intending to consider other transport modes with preliminary investigations due in 2008.  Other transport modes to be investigated, such as heavy rail or new light rail systems, are expected to meet several performance criteria before they can be considered as options for future public transport requirements.

In August 2005, a small-scale study involving three focus groups was conducted to gauge public interest in commuter rail for Christchurch.  The study concluded that there was interest in the idea if service expectations could be met.  An Environment Canterbury commissioned discussion paper (Sinclair, Knight Merz: The Future of Public Transport in Christchurch Discussion Paper, June 2004) concluded that priority should be given to bus-based public transport, but that future planning should include provision for other public transport options.  A 2005 consultants report (GHD limited: Network Level Investigative Report - Proposed Introduction of Commuter Rail Services to Christchurch City and Environs, June 2005) suggested that commuter rail would involve substantial costs and further investigation would be needed to determine what the requirements are.

Pete Hodgson, as a Minister for Transport, indicated that, providing passenger rail is incorporated into the Regional Land Transport Strategy, the central government would be prepared to meet 60% of the costs of purchasing rolling stock and extending infrastructure if so required, and noted that the initiative is consistent with the National Rail Strategy.

Two long-distance passenger services operate from Christchurch to Greymouth (the [[TranzAlpine|Tranz Alpine]]) and Picton (the [[TranzCoastal|Tranz Coastal]]).  These services operate from the only passenger railway station in Christchurch with departures each morning, returning in the evening.  Occasional steam-hauled excursion trains run from or through Christchurch operated by Mainline Steam.
