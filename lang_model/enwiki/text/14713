'''Forest Park''' is a municipal and public park in the [[Tualatin Mountains]] (West Hills) west of downtown [[Portland, Oregon]].  Stretching for more than {{convert|8|mi|km}} on hillsides overlooking the [[Willamette River]], it is one of the largest [[urban forest]] reserves in the United States. The park, a major component of a regional system of parks and trails, covers more than {{convert|5100|acre|km2}} of mostly [[Secondary forest|second-growth]] forest with a few patches of [[Old growth forest|old growth]].  About {{convert|70|mi|km}} of recreational [[trail]]s, including the Wildwood Trail segment of the city's [[40 Mile Loop]] system, crisscross the park. 

As early as the 1860s civic leaders sought to create a natural preserve in the woods near Portland. Their efforts led to the creation of a municipal park commission that in 1903 hired the [[Olmsted Brothers]] landscape architectural firm to develop a plan for Portland's parks. Acquiring land through donations, transfers from Multnomah County, and delinquent tax [[foreclosure]]s, the city eventually combined parcels totaling about {{convert|4000|acre|ha}} to create the reserve. Formally dedicated in 1948, it ranks 19th in size among parks within U.S. cities, according to [[The Trust for Public Land]].<ref name="largest">{{cite web|year = 2007| url=http://www.tpl.org/content_documents/citypark_facts/ccpe_150_LargestParks_08.pdf | format=PDF|title=150 Largest City Parks| date = 2008 | publisher=The Trust for Public Land |accessdate= April 7, 2009}} The Trust for Public Land (TPL) lists the size of the park as {{convert|4317|acre|ha}}, which is close to its original size of 1948. If the {{convert|5157|acre|ha|adj=on}} size claimed by the Portland Parks and Recreation Department in 2009 were used in the TPL listing, Forest Park would rank 17th.</ref>

More than 112&nbsp;bird species and 62&nbsp;mammal species frequent the park and its wide variety of trees and shade-loving plants.  About {{convert|40|in|mm}} of rain falls on the forest each year. Many small tributaries of the Willamette River flow northeast through the woods to pipes or [[culvert]]s under [[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]] at the edge of the park. One of them, [[Balch Creek]], has a resident [[trout]] population, and another, Miller Creek, supports sea-run species including [[salmon]]. Threats to the park include overuse, urban traffic, encroaching development, invasive plants, and lack of maintenance money. Occasional serious crimes and more frequent minor crimes occur in the park.

==Geology and geography==
Solidified [[lava]] from Grande Ronde members of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]] underlie Forest Park. About 16&nbsp;million years ago during the [[Middle Miocene]], the Columbia River ran through a lowland south of its modern channel. Eruptions from linear vents in eastern Oregon and Washington flowed down this channel through what later became the [[Willamette Valley]]. These flows, some of which reached the [[Pacific Ocean]], recurred at intervals between 16.5 and 15.6&nbsp;million years ago and covered almost {{convert|60000|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name ="Bishop">Bishop, pp. 141&ndash;48</ref> About eight separate Grande Ronde Basalt flows have been mapped in the [[Tualatin Mountains]] (West Hills), where they underlie the steepest slopes of Forest Park and form the columned rocks visible along [[Balch Creek]] Canyon and Northwest Cornell Road.<ref name ="Bishop"/> The West Hills were later covered by wind-deposited silts that become unstable when saturated with water. Stream bank instability and siltation are common, and landslides deter urban development at higher elevations.<ref name="Knudsen">{{cite web | last = Knudsen | first = Matt | coauthors = Pentilla, Jeanine; Petersen, Luke | title = Balch Creek Watershed: Good Policy, Poor Performance | publisher = Portland State University  | url = http://www.web.pdx.edu/~changh/balch.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = June 3, 2008 }}</ref>

Shaped like a tapered rectangle roughly {{convert|8|mi|km}} long, the park is less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide near downtown Portland and about {{convert|2|mi|km}} wide at its northwestern end.<ref name="Friends map set"/> It extends along the West Hills from West Burnside Street near downtown Portland to where the Willamette River divides to flow around [[Sauvie Island]].<ref name ="Houck 117"/> Covering most of the east face of the ridge above the Willamette River, it is bounded by West Burnside Street on the south, Northwest Skyline Boulevard on the west, Northwest Newberry Road on the north, and Northwest St. Helens Road ([[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]]) on the east.<ref name ="Houck 117"/> Elevations above [[sea level]] vary from {{convert|50|ft|m}}<ref name = "Thayer 92"/> near U.S. Route 30 at the base of the ridge to about {{convert|1100|ft|m}}<ref name ="Houle xiv"/> near the crest of the ridge along Northwest Skyline Boulevard.  

In 2008 Forest Park ranked 19th in size among the largest city parks in the United States, according to [[The Trust for Public Land]]. The trust<U+2019>s list included state parks, national parks, county parks, regional parks, and national wildlife refuges, as well as municipally-owned parks located within cities. [[Chugach State Park]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], was in first place with {{convert|490125|acre|km2|0}}.<ref name="largest"/>

Portland author Marcy Houle says that the park "captures the essence of what is natural and wild and beautiful about the Northwest... From this forest sanctuary, panoramic views of the city of Portland, the Willamette and Columbia rivers, and five major peaks of the Cascade Range ... can be seen through the tall fir trees. From its inception ..., Forest Park has been a refuge for both people and wildlife, and an integral part of the environment of Portland."<ref name ="Houle xiv"/>

==History==
[[Image:Forest park intersection of wildwood and birch trails P2864.jpeg|thumb|left|Intersection of Wildwood Trail and Birch Trail]] Before settlement by [[European American]]s of the West Hills, the land that became known as Forest Park was covered by a [[Douglas-fir]] forest. By 1851, its acreage had been divided into [[Donation Land Claim Act|donation land claim]]s filed by settlers with plans to clear the forest and build upon the property. After logging, the steep slopes and unstable silt loosened by heavy rains caused landslides that defeated construction plans, and claims were defaulted or donated to the city.<ref name ="Houck 117">Houck, p. 117</ref>
  
Civic leaders beginning with the Reverend [[Thomas Lamb Eliot]], a minister who moved to Portland in 1867, sought to create a natural preserve in the woods that eventually became Forest Park.<ref name="parks"/>  By 1899, Eliot's efforts led to the formation of the Municipal Park Commission of Portland, which in 1903 hired the highly regarded landscape architecture firm, the [[Olmsted Brothers]] of Brookline, Massachusetts, to study the city's park system and recommend a plan. [[John Charles Olmsted]], the stepson of [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], spent the month of May 1903 in Portland.<ref name ="Olmsted"/> The Olmsted Report, received in December, emphasized creation of a system of parks and linking parkways that would take advantage of natural scenery. It proposed a formal square for [[Union Station (Portland)|Union Station]], squares along the downtown waterfront, and parks in places later known as Forest Park, Sellwood Park, [[Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon|Mount Tabor Park]], [[Rocky Butte]], and [[Ross Island (Oregon)|Ross Island]], as well as Terwilliger Parkway, the [[40 Mile Loop]], and other connecting parkways. Proposed parks for Swan Island, in the Willamette River, and other places in Portland did not materialize. Others like Forest Park came into being only after many years.<ref name ="Olmsted">{{cite web|title = History of Portland Parks and Recreation: 1901&ndash;1920 | publisher = City of Portland |url = http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/index.cfm?c=39473&a=95956 | date = 2009 | accessdate = February 26, 2009}}</ref>

The city acquired land for Forest Park bit by bit over several decades. In 1897 Donald Macleay, a Portland merchant and real-estate developer, deeded a {{convert|108|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract of land along Balch Creek to the city to provide an outdoor space for patients from nearby hospitals.<ref name ="Macleay">{{cite web|title = History of Portland Parks and Recreation: 1852&ndash;1900 | publisher = City of Portland |url = http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/index.cfm?c=39473&a=95955 | date = 2009 | accessdate = February 26, 2009}}</ref> In the 1890s, Frederick Van Voorhies Holman, a Portland lawyer and a president of the [[Oregon Historical Society]], proposed a gift of {{convert|52|acre|ha}} of nearby land that was added to the city's holdings in 1939 when his [[sibling]]s, George F. and Mary Holman, completed the donation.<ref name ="parks"/> Clark and Wilson Timber Company donated {{convert|17|acre|ha}} in 1927 to create a Western Oregon timber park near Northwest Germantown Road.<ref>{{cite web|title = Clark & Wilson Park | publisher = City of Portland |url = http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&PropertyID=894 | date = 2009 | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> Nine years later, the estate of Aaron Meier, one of the founders of the [[Meier & Frank]] chain of department stores, donated land for Linnton Park near Portland's [[Linnton, Portland, Oregon|Linnton]] neighborhood along Highway 30.<ref>{{cite web|title = Linnton Park | publisher = City of Portland |url = http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&PropertyID=240 | date = 2009 | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref>  These smaller parks became part of the larger park when it was finally created.

Other parcels were acquired through government action. In 1928, the City Council's Delinquent Tax Committee transferred land to the Parks Bureau for a wildflower garden along Balch Creek. [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] in that same year gave the bureau perpetual use of about {{convert|145|acre|ha}} of land north of Washington Park.<ref name ="wildflower">{{cite web|title = History of Portland Parks and Recreation: 1921&ndash;1940 | publisher = City of Portland |url = http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/index.cfm?c=39473&a=95957 | date = 2009 | accessdate = February 26, 2009}}</ref> Encouraged by the [[City Club of Portland]], which conducted a park feasibility study in 1945, civic leaders supported the Forest Park project. In 1948, Multnomah County transferred to the city another {{convert|2000|acre|ha}} acquired through delinquent tax [[foreclosure]]s.<ref name ="foreclosure">{{cite web|title = History of Portland Parks and Recreation: 1941&ndash;1960 | publisher = City of Portland |url =http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/index.cfm?c=39473&a=95958 | date = 2009 | accessdate = February 26, 2009}}</ref> On September 23, 1948, the city formally dedicated {{convert|4200|acre|km2}} of land as Forest Park, which as of 2009 covered more than {{convert|5100|acre|km2}}.<ref name="parks"/> It is one of the largest [[urban forest]] reserves in the U.S, though its exact ranking has been questioned. The city's Parks and Recreation Department claims it is the "largest forested natural area within city limits in the United States".<ref name="parks"/> However, an article in the ''Portland Tribune'' said Forest Park ranked no higher than third among U.S. urban forests in 2006.<ref name ="Tribune">{{cite news|last = Korn | first = Peter |title = Forest Park fallacy: Boosters' claim of 'largest forested city park' is long outdated | work = Portland Tribune |publisher = Pamplin Media Group |url = http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=115319034143601100 | date = July 18, 2006 | accessdate = April 12, 2009}}</ref>

In 1991,  [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]], the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the [[Portland metropolitan area]], began budgeting for what became its Natural Areas Program aimed at protecting these areas in Multnomah, [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]], and [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]] counties.<ref>{{cite news| last = Mayer | first = James | title = Metro Council Passes $228.3 Million Budget | work = The Oregonian | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Company | date = May 3, 1991 }}</ref> By 1995, the program had targeted {{convert|320|acre|ha}} adjacent to or within Forest Park for acquisition. A 2006 bond measure allowed for the purchase of more land to expand the park, to protect its creeks' headwaters and those of nearby streams in [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]], and to link Forest Park to other public lands to the northwest.<ref name ="Metro">{{cite web|title = Forest Park Connections | publisher = Metro (Oregon regional government) |url = http://www.oregonmetro.gov/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=24615| date = 2009 | accessdate = April 12, 2009}}</ref> In addition to buying land, the regional government protects it through environmental [[easement]]s on land that is privately owned. Through early 2009, the agency had acquired or protected {{convert|865|acre|ha}} related to Forest Park, including {{convert|600|acre|ha}} beyond the existing park's northern boundary.<ref name = "Metro"/>

==Recreational network==
[[Image:Forest park volunteers rerouting wildwood trail P2841.jpeg|thumb|left|Volunteers at work on Wildwood Trail]] 

Forest Park is a major component, sometimes called the "crown jewel", of a regional network of parks, trails, and natural areas.<ref name ="Metro"/> At the southeastern end of the park, Wildwood Trail, the centerpiece of the Forest Park trail system, passes through Macleay Park. This part of the larger park, which includes the Forest Park field headquarters, is heavily used by pedestrians entering [[Balch Creek]] Canyon from nearby city streets.<ref>Houck, p. 119</ref>  Further southeast, Wildwood Trail, while still in Forest Park, passes [[Pittock Mansion]] and its panoramic views of Portland and five volcanic peaks: Mounts [[Mount Ranier|Rainier]], [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Adams]], [[Mount St. Helens|St. Helens]], [[Mount Hood|Hood]], and [[Mount Jefferson|Jefferson]].<ref name ="Houle xiv"/> Shortly thereafter, the trail connects to adjoining [[Washington Park (Portland, Oregon)|Washington Park]] and attractions such as the [[Oregon Zoo]]. From this point and from more remote Forest Park trailheads near the [[St. Johns Bridge]], other components of the [[40 Mile Loop]] system of trails encircle the city. They follow the Willamette and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers, the [[Columbia Slough]] and the [[Springwater Corridor]] along [[Johnson Creek (Willamette River)|Johnson Creek]] and extend to the eastern suburbs of [[Fairview, Oregon|Fairview]],  [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]] and [[Boring, Oregon|Boring]].<ref name = "Loop map">{{cite web  | title = 40-Mile Loop Trail Map  | publisher = 40 Mile Loop Land Trust  | date = 2004  | url = http://www.40mileloop.org/maps/40MileLoop_map.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = April 14, 2009}}</ref> This trail network links more than 30&nbsp;separate parks that offer diverse recreational opportunities, such as horse-back riding, in-line skating, canoeing, and viewing of wetland wildlife, in addition to hiking and biking.<ref>{{cite web| title = History of the 40-Mile Loop | publisher = 40 Mile Loop Land Trust | url = http://www.40mileloop.org/history.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = April 14, 2009}}</ref> It connects to other trail systems such as Discovery Trail in [[Clark County, Washington]], and the Terwilliger Trail running through [[Tryon Creek State Natural Area]] to [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Lake Oswego]].<ref name = "Loop map"/>

As of 2009, this network of parks and trails is still expanding. Metro, the regional government, plans to link the 40 Mile Loop to trails along the Willamette River to [[Wilsonville, Oregon|Wilsonville]], south of Lake Oswego.<ref>{{cite web|title = Willamette River Greenway | publisher = Metro (Oregon regional government) |url = http://www.oregonmetro.gov/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=24630

===Wildwood Trail===
More than {{convert|70|mi|km}} of trails and firelanes cut through the park.<ref name="Friends map set"/> The longest trail in the park is the Wildwood Trail, of which about {{convert|27|mi|km}} is in Forest Park and about {{convert|3|mi|km}} in Washington Park.<ref name="Friends map set"/> It is also the longest section of the 40 Mile Loop, a trail network of roughly {{convert|150|mi|km}} reaching many parts of the Portland metropolitan area.<ref>Houck, p. 110</ref> The trail runs southeast to northwest from [[Trail blazing|trail marker]]&nbsp;0 in Washington Park to Northwest Newberry Road, just beyond trail marker&nbsp;30 on the ridge above the southeastern end of Sauvie Island. The straight-line distance from beginning to end is about {{convert|9|mi|km}}, but because the trail includes many [[wikt:switchback|switchback]]s and [[hairpin turn]]s, it is {{convert|30.2|mi|km|}} long.<ref name="Friends map set"/>

Wildwood Trail begins in Washington Park near the Oregon Zoo, a [[Washington Park (MAX station)|light rail]] stop, the [[Oregon Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], the [[World Forestry Center]] and the [[Hoyt Arboretum]]. Blue diamonds placed about {{convert|6|ft|m}} above the ground appear on trees along the trail every {{convert|0.25|mi|km}}. The diamonds and the mileage markers above them are visible to hikers traveling in either direction on the path. In its first {{convert|5|mi|km}}, the trail passes near the [[Portland Japanese Garden]], Pittock Mansion, the [[Audubon Society of Portland]] wildlife sanctuary, and the Stone House in Balch Creek Canyon. From this point west, Wildwood Trail runs through forest generally uninterrupted by buildings but crisscrossed by shorter trails, small streams, roads, and firelanes.<ref name="Friends map set">{{cite map |publisher = Friends of Forest Park |title = Hiking and Running Guide to Forest Park |edition = 2003 |section = Index Map, Stone House, City View, Wild-Leif, Heart of the Park, Old Growth, Avenue of Trees, Maple, Big Stump, Hole in the Park |isbn = 9781135134020}}</ref>

===Other paths, streets, easements===
Many shorter Forest Park trails, roads, and firelanes intersect the Wildwood Trail. Most of the trails are open only to hikers and runners, but several roads and firelanes are open to bicycles or horses or both. Leif Erickson Drive, a road closed to motorized traffic, runs at lower elevation than and roughly parallel to the Wildwood Trail for about {{convert|11|mi|km}} from the end of Northwest Thurman Street to Northwest Germantown Road.<ref name ="Friends map set"/> Originally called Hillside Drive, it was renamed in 1933 at the request of the [[Sons of Norway]], a fraternal organization.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Richard | first = Terry  | title = Forest Park facts  | work = The Oregonian  | page = AE04  | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co.  | date = April 24, 1998  }}</ref> [[Easement]]s for an oil line, a gas line, and electric transmission lines for the [[Bonneville Power Administration]] (BPA) cross the park.<ref>Houck, pp. 117&ndash;18</ref> Paved roads surround the park, which is crossed or entered by other roads including Northwest Pittock Drive, Northwest Cornell Road, Northwest 53rd&nbsp;Drive, Northwest Saltzman Road, Northwest Springville Road, Northwest Germantown Road, Northwest Newton Road, and BPA Road.<ref name ="Friends map set"/>

==Vegetation==
[[File:Achlys triphylla 10659.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Vanilla leaf forms part of the forest understory.]] Forest Park lies in the [[Coast Range (ecoregion)|Coast Range ecoregion]] designated by the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).<ref>{{cite web | last = Thorson | first = T.D. | coauthors = Bryce, S.A.; Lammers, D.A., ''et al.'' | title = Ecoregions of Oregon (front side of color poster with map, descriptive text, summary tables, and photographs) | publisher = [[United States Geological Survey]]

Much of the forest that existed here before 1850 was gone by 1940. The stage of re-growth in the forest depends on when it was last logged or burned.<ref name = "Houle 16">Houle, pp. 16&ndash;23</ref>

In the mid-1990s, about one percent of the total vegetation in the park consisted of grasses, [[bracken]], [[thistle]], and [[fireweed]] in sections of the forest cleared two to five years earlier. Another two percent had reached the shrub stage, between three and thirty years old, with small trees dominated by such plants as [[thimbleberry]], [[Rubus spectabilis|salmonberry]], and [[blackberry]]. Forest areas 10 to 30&nbsp;years old that contained tall alder and maple trees and smaller [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s accounted for about 20&nbsp;percent of the park.<ref name = "Houle 16"/>

Larger areas were occupied by forests in which conifers had grown taller than the alders and maples. About 50&nbsp;percent of Forest Park consists of these areas, which are between 30 and 80&nbsp;years old and in which Douglas-firs have begun to dominate. Another 25&nbsp;percent of the park contains forests dominated by middle-aged conifers, 80 to 250&nbsp;years old. In these areas, red alders, which live for about 100&nbsp;years, have begun to die, and the Douglas-firs, which can live for 750&nbsp;years, attain heights up to about {{convert|240|ft|m}}. Under the big trees are shade-tolerant trees such as western red cedar, western hemlock, and grand fir and smaller plants such as [[Oregon-grape]], [[Acer circinatum|vine maple]], and [[salal]].<ref name = "Houle 16"/>

The last forest stage, [[Old growth forest|old growth]], is reached after 250&nbsp;years and includes many [[snag]]s, downed and dead trees, and fallen logs. Timber-cutting and fires reduced old growth in Forest Park to "almost nothing"<ref name = "Houle 16"/>  by 1940, and most of the forest has not yet attained this stage.

Pressure from habitat loss, pollution, hunting, and urban development has reduced or eliminated the presence of wolves, bears, and wild cats and has led to increased numbers of [[weasel]]s, [[raccoon]]s, and other small predators. Invasive plant species such as English ivy have made the habitat simpler and less supportive of native insects and the salamanders and other amphibians that feed on them. Roads in the area severely hamper the movement of large animals.<ref name="wildlife" /> In 2002, about 4,500&nbsp;vehicles were using Northwest Germantown Road on weekdays near its intersection with Northwest Skyline Boulevard, according to an [[annual average daily traffic]] (AADT) count conducted by Multnomah County.<ref>{{cite news|title = AADT Count: NW Germantown Rd | publisher = Multnomah County |  url = http://www2.co.multnomah.or.us/Departments/Community_Services/LUT-Road_Engineering/Traffic/PDF/Germantown%20AADT%202002%20Old%20Germantown%20(East)%20and%20Skyline.pdf  |date = 2002| format = PDF | accessdate = February 26, 2009}}</ref> In 2003, a count along Northwest Skyline Road near its intersection with Northwest Cornell Road recorded as many as 2,800&nbsp;vehicles using the road on weekdays.<ref>{{cite web|title= AADT Count: NW Skyline Blvd | publisher = Multnomah County |url = http://www2.co.multnomah.or.us/Departments/Community_Services/LUT-Road_Engineering/Traffic/PDF/Skyline%20AADT%202003%20Cornell%20and%20Greenleaf.pdf | format = PDF |  date = 2003 | accessdate = February 26, 2009}}</ref>

==Crime and other trouble==
Forest Park has occasionally been the scene of murder and other major crimes. In 2001, a man who preyed on [[heroin]] addicts and [[prostitutes]] pleaded guilty to the 1999 murder of three women whose bodies were found in Forest Park near Northwest Saltzman Road.<ref name= "murder1">{{cite news  |  title = Man pleads guilty in Forest Park murders | work = [[The Oregonian]] | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co. | page = A01 | date = February 23, 2001}} </ref> In 2003, jurors convicted another man of the 1996 murder of his ex-girlfriend on a Forest Park trail.<ref name= "murder2">{{cite news |last = Franzen |first= Robin |  title = Man convicted of Forest Park murder | work = [[The Oregonian]] | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co. | page = B02 | date = April 24, 2003}} </ref> Less serious crimes have included assault, car theft, arson,<ref name= "in the news">{{cite news |last = Anthony |first = Roger |  title = Portland's back yard Forest Park has been in the news this week | work = [[The Oregonian]] | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co. | page = B09 | date = May 14, 1999}} </ref> indecent exposure,<ref name= "exposure">{{cite news |last = Boule | first = Margie |  title = Forest Park flasher getting different kind of exposure | work = [[The Oregonian]] | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co. | page = B01 | date = July 27, 1993}} </ref> and marijuana cultivation. Multnomah County Sheriff's deputies in 2007 seized 114&nbsp;mature marijuana plants found growing in the park on a hillside near Portland's [[Linnton, Portland, Oregon|Linnton]] neighborhood. Deputies had seized another small grow operation in the park in 2005.<ref name= "Aimee Green">{{cite news | last = Green | first = Aimee | title = Marijuana plants found growing in Forest Park | work = [[The Oregonian]] | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co. | page = D03 | date = October 4, 2007}} </ref>  More common has been illegal camping by [[Homelessness|homeless]] transients and others.<ref name= "transients">{{cite news |last = Menefee | first = Tonya |  title = Transients seeking solace of Forest Park | work = [[The Oregonian]] | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co. | page = B02 | date = July 29, 1992}} </ref>

In 2004, authorities found a 53-year-old man and his 12-year-old daughter living in the park in a tarp-covered structure stocked with encyclopedias for homeschooling. They told police they had been living in the park for four years.<ref name= "Berstein">{{cite news  | last = Bernstein | first = Maxine | title = Out of the woods police rescue father, girl who say Forest Park was their home for four years | work = [[The Oregonian]] | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Co. | page = A01 | date = May 20, 2004}} </ref> ''My Abandonment'', a novel by [[Peter Rock (novelist)|Peter Rock]], tells a story built around the incident.<ref>{{cite web|last = Bettencourt | first = Donna| title = Fiction: Rock, Peter: ''My Abandonment'' | publisher = ''Library Journal'' | date = November 15, 2008 | url = http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6612144.html | accessdate = March 24, 2009}}</ref>

In 2005, a reporter for ''[[The Oregonian]]'' newspaper interviewed biologists, conservationists, Parks and Recreation officials, and others about the health of Forest Park and its future prospects. Collectively they identified the following threats to the park: urban development that restricts the movement of wild animals and birds; overuse; invasive plants; loose dogs; fire risk; increasing rates of tree death; lack of rule enforcement, and lack of money. The park has no central entrance, no capital budget, and no permanent rangers.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Leeson  | first = Fred  | title = The trouble with Forest Park  | work = The Oregonian  | page = 16  | publisher = Oregonian Publishing Company  | date = November 24, 2005  }}</ref>
