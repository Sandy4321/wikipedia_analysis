The '''Kashmir Gray Langur''' (''Semnopithecus ajax'') is an [[Old World monkey]], one of the species of [[langur]]s. This, like other [[gray langur]]s, is a [[leaf-eating]] monkey.  It is found in [[India]] west into Pakastani [[Kashmir]]<ref name=msw3/> and [[Nepal]]<ref name=iucn/>  It was formerly considered a subspecies of ''[[Semnopithecus entellus]]'' and is one of several ''Semnopithecus'' species named after characters from ''[[The Iliad]]'', along with ''[[Semnopithecus hector]]'' and ''[[Semnopithecus priam]]''.

The Kashmir Gray Langur is considered to be critically endangered.  This is due to its restricted range, fragmented population, and threats from human agriculture and development activities.<ref name=iucn/>  It is [[arboreal]] and [[diurnal]], and lives in several types of forest as well as in areas inhabited by humans at altitudes between 2200 and 4000 [[meter]]s.<ref name=iucn/>

The birthing season for the Kashmir Gray Langur runs from January through June, although almost half of all infants are born in March.<ref name=perspective>{{cite book|title=Primates in Perspective | chapter = The Asian Colobines| author = R.

While most Asian colobines wean their young within the first year, Kashmir Gray Langurs wean their young on average at 25 months.<ref name=perspective/>  This is apparently due to nutritional constraints, since monkeys in poorer sites wean their young at an older age.<ref name=perspective/> The interbirth interval for females is about 2.4 years.<ref name=perspective/>

[[Alloparental care]] occurs in Kashmir's gray langur for up to 5 months.<ref name=perspective/>  Males are usually protective of infants, but [[infanticide]] occasionally occurs.<ref name=perspective/>  

Although most Asian colobine groups contain only a single adult male and multiple females, multimale groups are known to occur within ''Semnopithecus'' species  With Kashmir's Gray Langur, multimale groups may include as many as five adult males.<ref name=perspective/>  Females initiate copulation by soliciting a male, but not all solicitations result in copulation.<ref name=perspective/>
