{{main|Rail transport in Australia}}

'''Rail transport in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]''', [[Australia]], is provided by a number of railway operators who operate over the government owned [[railway]] lines. Victorian lines use {{5 ft 3 in}} [[Victorian broad gauge|broad gauge]], with the exception of a number of [[standard gauge]] {{4ft8.5in}} freight and interstate lines, a few experimental {{2ft6in}} [[Narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways|narrow gauge]] lines, and various private logging, mining and industrial railways.

Railways were once privately owned and operated, until the State Government established of the [[Vertical integration|vertically integrated]] [[Victorian Railways]] in 1883. This remained until [[Corporatization|corporatisation]] occurred in the 1980s, followed by [[Privatization|privatisation]] in the 1990s. Passenger services today are operated by [[Connex Melbourne]] in suburban [[Melbourne]] with [[Electric Multiple Units|electric multiple units]], and [[V/Line]] in regional Victoria with diesel trains. Freight is operated by [[Pacific National]] and other private operators such as [[El Zorro (Railway)|El Zorro]], [[Specialised Container Transport]] and [[QRNational]].

The rail network radiates from state capital of Melbourne, with two main interstate links to [[Sydney]] and [[Adelaide]], as well as major railways running to regional centres,<ref name="awaugh">{{cite web | title = Victorian Railway Maps 1860 - 2000 | work = Victorian Railways Resources | publisher = Andrew Waugh | url = http://www.vrhistory.com/VRMaps/ | format = HTML | accessdate = 2008-02-05 }}</ref> upgraded as part of the [[Regional Fast Rail project]].

The suburban network expanded to the east from [[Princes Bridge railway station, Melbourne|Princes Bridge railway station]] to [[Richmond railway station, Melbourne|Richmond]] in 1859, then later to Brighton and Hawthorn by the early 1860s. the initial suburban lines were all built by different private companies centred upon Flinders St, being amalgamated into the [[Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company|Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway Company]] by 1865,<ref name="awaugh" /> with public ownership not coming until 1878.<ref name="vrhist" >{{cite web | title =  VR timeline | work = http://www.victorianrailways.net/ | publisher = Mark Bau | url = http://www.victorianrailways.net/vr%20history/history.html | format = HTML | accessdate = 2008-02-05 }}</ref> In 1862 [[Victorian Railways]] lines had reached the great [[Victorian gold rush|gold rush]] towns of [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] and [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], and in 1864 railways were extended to the [[Murray River]] port of [[Echuca, Victoria|Echuca]].<ref name="vrhist" />

In 1883 the first connection to another State's rail system was made, when the [[Albury-Wodonga railway line, Victoria|Albury-Wodonga line]]  was completed to the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]'s station at [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], requiring a [[break-of-gauge]] to New South Wales's [[standard gauge]] ({{4ft8.5in}}).<ref name="newsrail-line">{{cite journal

In 1884 [[Parliament_of_Victoria|State Parliament]] passed ''The Railway Construction Act'', which authorised fifty-nine new lines to almost every corner of the state, and thus became known as the ''Octopus Act''.

[[Image:X32.jpg|thumb|Steam locomotive [[Victorian Railways X class|X 32]], hauling a livestock train]]

After [[World War II]] the railways were run down, with [[Operation Phoenix (railway)|Operation Phoenix]] unveiled in 1950, involving the expenditure of <U+00A3>80,000,000 over 10 years.<ref name="arhs3">{{cite web | title = ARHS Railway Museum: Victoria 1950 - now | work = ARHS Railway Museum | url = http://www.railwaymuseum.org.au/history3.html | format = HTML | accessdate = 2008-02-05 }}</ref> Works included [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] to [[Traralgon, Victoria|Traralgon]], new [[Harris (train)|Harris suburban trains]], the Walker railmotors, and approximately 3,000 new goods wagons.<ref name="vrhist" />
    
On July 14 1952 the VR entered the [[dieselisation|diesel era]], with the delivery of the first [[Victorian Railways B class (diesel)|B class]] mainline locomotive,<ref name="arhs3" /> with the commissioning of the first mainline electrification scheme in Australia in July 1954 to Warrugul.<ref name="vrhist" /> March 1954 saw [[Queen Elizabeth II]] tour Victoria by train, the first time a reigning monarch had travelled on the VR,<ref name="vrhist" /> 1954 also saw the last last steam locomotive to enter service, [[Victorian_Railways_J_class|J class 559]],<ref name="vrhist" /> as well as the last four wheeled open wagons being built.<ref name="wagons" /> The fifties also saw the loss of a number of short branch lines, particularly country where the only traffic had been timber or livestock.<ref name="awaugh" />

In the 1960s the [[break of gauge]] at Albury was eliminated, with the opening of the [[North East standard gauge line, Victoria|North East standard gauge line]] in 1962.<ref name="arhs3" /> The new line aided freight traffic between the state capitals, and enabled though passenger trains, such as the ''[[Southern Aurora]]'' and the ''[[Intercapital Daylight]]''. At the same time the sixties was also the end of steam, with the demolition of the massive North Melbourne steam locomotive depot on January 20, 1961.<ref name="vrhist" />

1965 saw the Victorian Railways produce at <U+00A3>193,727 surplus, but by 1973 it had turned into a $86,086,361 deficit. On July 20, 1976 the Laverton derailment occurred, killing one passenger, it is the last railway passenger fatality not involving a road vehicle.<ref name="vrhist" /> By the late seventies roadside goods and country railmotor services had been replaced by road transport, and branch lines outside the grain producing areas were now virtually non-existent.<ref name="awaugh" />

[[Image:Vline_n_class_train_at_lara_victoria.jpg|thumb|[[Victorian Railways N class (diesel)|N class]] locomotive with [[N type carriage|"N" type]] country passenger carriages.]]

The 1980s saw [[Corporatization|corporatisation]] of the [[Victorian Railways]] carried out, with the railway commissioners replaced by [[VicRail]] and later government authorities. New liveries on trains were unveiled, as elderly ''"red rattlers"'' were replaced by new trains.

1981 saw the [[City Loop, Melbourne|Melbourne underground loop]] open in January, followed by the new air conditioned  [[Comeng (train)|Comeng suburban trains]] and [[N type carriage|"N" type]] country passenger carriages in September the same year.<ref name="vrhist" /> Country services were also sped up under the ''New Deal'' by the closure of dozens of small wayside stations. Country passenger services saw the last of the wooden bodied passenger cars withdrawn from service in 1986, replaced by new [[H type carriage|"H" set]] carriages. Trials were also carried out for further upgrades, with locomotive [[Victorian Railways A class (diesel)|A85]] re-geared for 160&nbsp;km/h operation in a series of test runs between [[Glenorchy, Victoria|Glenorchy]] and [[Lubeck, Victoria|Lubeck]] in the state's west in July 1986.<ref name="newsrails86">{{cite journal

Today, the state consists of four networks: the [[Railways in Melbourne|electrified metropolitan system]] operated by [[Connex Melbourne]], the [[List_of_regional_railway_stations_in_Victoria|country passenger network]] operated by [[V/Line]] and upgraded as part of the [[Regional Fast Rail project]], the standard gauge interstate lines to Adelaide and Sydney, and the grain network in the north west of the state, connected to the ports at Geelong and Portland.<ref name="awaugh" />

The trunk railway lines of Victoria are double track, some built as such, and others duplicated later on. Early sections of the suburban network were [[double track]], with later additions being [[Single track (rail)|single track]] that was later duplicated.

The [[Bendigo railway line, Victoria|Bendigo]] and [[Geelong - Ballarat railway line, Victoria|Geelong - Ballarat]] mainlines were both built as double track in the 1860s, but were singled in the 1930s and 2000s respectively.

On the interstate railway corridors there are independent sections of track due to the use of both broad and standard gauges in the state, these sections being from Melbourne to Seymour and on to Albury (constructed in the 1960s), and Melbourne to Geelong (completed in 1995). The gauge issue also sees [[dual gauge]] track used, in areas including [[Maryborough railway station, Victoria|Maryborough]], North Geelong, and various freight terminals in Melbourne.

The maximum speed of suburban [[Electric Multiple Unit]]s and locomotive hauled trains is 115&nbsp;km/h, with [[Diesel Multiple Unit]]s permitted up to 130&nbsp;km/h on the same track, and up to 160&nbsp;km/h on specified lines.<ref name="vlpnspaddenda" /> The maximum axle loading of freight wagons is 20 tonnes,<ref name="vlpnspnoc" /> with locomotives of up to 22 tonne axle loading operating.<ref name="vlpnspaddenda">{{cite web | publisher = V/Line Regional Network and Access | title = Addenda | work = [http://www.vline.com.au/rna/rna/information_pack.html V/Line Network Service Plan] | url = http://www.vline.com.au/pdf/rna/addenda.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-09-10 }}</ref> Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres, except on the main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted.<ref name="vlpnspnoc" />

The majority of the railways of Victoria are of {{5 ft 3 in}} [[Victorian broad gauge|broad gauge]], presenting [[break-of-gauge]] difficulties when connections were made with New South Wales which uses the {{4ft8.5in}} [[standard gauge]]. In addition, the [[Victorian Railways]] experimented with four short [[Narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways|narrow gauge]] lines of {{2 ft 6 in}} in the early 20th century. Efforts to eliminate the gauge issue were proposed many times in the intervening years, with a [[List of Australian Royal Commissions|Royal Commission]] in 1921 deciding "''that the gauge of 4-ft. 8.5-in. be adopted as the standard for Australia; that no mechanical, third rail, or other device would meet the situation, and that uniformity could be secured by one means only, viz., by conversion of the gauges other than 4-ft. 8.5-in.''"<ref>{{cite web

A variant of the ''Automatic Block System'', ''Automatic and Track Control'' (ATC) has since been introduced, which provides the same benefits as ABS on single lines of track, while still ensuring only one train in a section at a time. [[Centralized traffic control|Centralised Traffic Control]] was also introduced in the 1960s on the new standard gauge line to Albury,<ref name="somerton" /> and then on the main interstate line to Adelaide, allowing trains to be directed from a distance.

Today little mechanical signalling remains, with local [[signal box]]es controlling signals abolished from many areas as part of the [[Regional Fast Rail project]].<ref name="sigx" /> Today the suburban network and busier regional lines use variants of Automatic Block Signalling, while quieter lines use the [[Token (railway signalling)|Train Staff and Ticket]] or [[Train order operation|Train Order]] systems of safeworking.<ref>{{cite web | title = Safeworking in Victoria

The first railways in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] were operated by private companies, but when these companies failed or defaulted, [[Victorian Railways]] took over. The Victorian Railways was initially known as the "Department of Railways" from the first appointment of staff in 1856, and on [[1 November]] [[1883]] the Victorian Railways Commissioners Act established the "Victorian Railways".<ref name="arhs1">{{cite web | title = ARHS Railway Museum: Victoria 1839 - 1900 | work = ARHS Railway Museum | url = http://www.railwaymuseum.org.au/history.html | format = HTML | accessdate = 2008-02-05 }}</ref>

In 1983 VicRail was split into the [[State Transport Authority (Victoria)|State Transport Authority]] taking responsibility for the provision of country rail and road, passenger and freight services under the [[V/Line]] brand; and the [[Metropolitan Transit Authority (Victoria)|Metropolitan Transit Authority]] taking over [[Railways in Melbourne|suburban passenger]] operations.<ref name="arhs3" /> These authorities were then merged into the [[Public Transport Corporation]] in 1989, with the suburban services rebranded as "[[Metlink|The Met]]". 

In 1993 the Kennett Government offered long-distance country rail services previously run by the government-owned operator V/Line to private operators. While several rail services were replaced by road coach services, [[West Coast Railway (Victoria)|West Coast Railway]] successfully tendered to operate the railway line to [[Warrnambool railway line, Victoria|Warrnambool]], becoming the first private operator in Victoria.<ref name=Age>{{cite news | author = Philip Hopkins | title = End of the line for West Coast Rail | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/18/1090089033538.html?from=storylhs | work = The Age | date = 2004-07-19 | accessdate = 2008-02-05}}</ref> In 1993 Professor [[Fred Hilmer]] presented the findings of the National Competition Policy Review Committee, known as the [[Hilmer Report]], leading to the introduction of [[National Competition Policy]] in 1995.

Privatisation of the Public Transport Corporation commenced under the [[Jeff Kennett|Kennett]] Government of the 1990s. V/Line was split into separate freight and passenger divisions, and "The Met" was divided into "Hillside Trains" and "Bayside Trains". These separate bodies were all sold separately in 1999: V/Line Freight and the rural intrastate network to [[Freight Victoria]]; Hillside Trains and track lease to [[Connex Melbourne]]; and V/Line Passenger and Bayside Trains (with track lease) to the [[National Express Group]].<ref name="arhs3" /> Control of V/Line's former interstate rail freight infrastructure was passed to the federal [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]].

==By line==  
{{VictorianRailwayLines}}

Australia's first railway was a 4&nbsp;km [[Victorian broad gauge]] line between the [[Melbourne]] (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern day [[Flinders Street Station]]) and Sandridge (now [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Port Melbourne]]), constructed by the [[Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company]] and opened in September 1854. Today, '''[[Railways in Melbourne|Melbourne's suburban railway network]]''' consists of 16 [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] lines, the central [[City Loop, Melbourne|City Loop]] subway, and 200 [[Train station|stations]], with a total length of 372&nbsp;km of the electrified lines, operated by [[Connex Melbourne]] under [[franchising|franchise]] to the [[Government of Victoria]].

In [[Gippsland]] the '''[[Bairnsdale railway line, Victoria|Bairnsdale line]]''' was constructed as an extension of suburban lines between 1877 and 1888 to [[Bairnsdale, Victoria|Bairnsdale]], and extended eastwards to [[Orbost, Victoria|Orbost]] in 1916.<ref name="newsrail-line" /> The line between Dandenong and Traralgon was electrified in 1954, but electrification was cut back progressively to [[Pakenham railway station, Melbourne|Pakenham]] between 1987 and 2001. [[V/Line]] passenger trains now run as far as Bairnsdale.

The '''[[South Gippsland railway line, Victoria|South Gippsland line]]''' was opened from Dandenong to [[Cranbourne railway station, Melbourne|Cranbourne]], [[Leongatha, Victoria|Leongatha]] and [[Port Albert, Victoria|Port Albert]] between 1888 and 1892.<ref name="newsrail-line" /> A number of branch lines were also built, with almost all closed in stages between the early 1970s and 1994, except for part has since been electrified and re-opened as part of the suburban network, and between Nyora and Leongatha where the [[South Gippsland Tourist Railway]] operates heritage services.

The '''[[Albury-Wodonga railway line, Victoria|Albury-Wodonga line]]''' originated from a suburban line to [[Essendon railway station, Melbourne|Essendon]] in 1860, being extended to [[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]] by 1873, connecting with the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] at [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] at a [[break-of-gauge]] in 1883.<ref name="newsrail-line" /> A standard gauge track was completed parallel with the broad gauge track from Albury to Melbourne in 1962.<ref name="arhs3"/> [[V/Line]] services operate along the broad gauge line, while the Melbourne-Sydney [[Countrylink]] [[XPT (Train)|XPT]] runs on the standard gauge.

The '''[[Shepparton_railway_line,_Victoria|Shepparton line]]''' was built from Mangalore to [[Shepparton, Victoria|Shepparton]] in 1880 and extended to the New South Wales Government Railways at [[Tocumwal, New South Wales|Tocumwal]] at a [[break-of-gauge]] in 1908.<ref name="newsrail-line" /> [[V/Line]] passenger service run as far as Shepparton.

The '''[[Bendigo railway line, Victoria|Bendigo line]]''' was completed in 1862, with extensions were opened to [[Echuca, Victoria|Echuca]] in 1864, and [[Swan Hill, Victoria|Swan Hill]] in 1890,<ref name="newsrail-line" /> followed by a number of lines throughout the north-west corner of the state. Only these lines continue to see [[V/Line]] services, with other lines in the region only seeing freight traffic.

The first railway line from Melbourne to Ballarat was via [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], opening in 1862,<ref name="rg" /> with the line extended from Ballarat to [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]] between 1874 and 1875.<ref name="newsrail-line" /> It was not until 1889 that the '''[[Ballarat railway line, Victoria|direct line between Melbourne and Ballarat]]''' was opened, built from both ends in stages until they met at [[Ballan, Victoria|Ballan]]. Further branch lines followed to [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]] and other western towns. The line formed the first interstate railway line in Australia, when it was extended to the the [[South Australian Railways]] at [[Serviceton, Victoria|Serviceton]] in 1887.  Up until the 1990s the Ballarat line was on the main route between Melbourne and [[Adelaide]], as well as ''[[The Overland]]'' services to Adelaide, until the [[One Nation (Infrastructure)|One Nation Program]] rerouted the main interstate line via [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]] and [[Maroona, Victoria|Maroona]] as standard gauge.<ref name="rtsa"/>

The [[Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company]] opened the '''[[Geelong railway line, Victoria|Geelong line]]''' to [[Newport railway station, Melbourne|Newport]] in 1857, being extended to [[Southern Cross Station|Spencer Street Station]] in 1859.<ref name="rg" /> The ine was taken over by Victorian Railways in 1860 and a line was opened from Geelong to [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] in 1862.<ref name="rg" /> The line was later extended south-east from 1876, reaching [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]] and [[Port Fairy, Victoria|Port Fairy]] in 1890.<ref name="rg" /> Branch lines also existed to [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]], [[Beech Forest, Victoria|Beech Forest]], and a number of other towns.<ref name="rg" />

==Private railways==
[[Image:Overburden-dredge-yallourn.jpg|thumb|Trains on the [[Yallourn 900mm Railway]]]]

A small number of private railways have also existed at various times. Some, such as the [[Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company]], and the [[Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company]], [[Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company]] and [[St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company]] were acquired by the [[Victorian Railways]] and made part of the core state network in 1860 and 1878 respectively. Other country branch lines were also built by private companies: namely the [[Kerang-Koondrook Tramway]] and the [[Deniliquin and Moama Railway]],<ref name="absrail">[http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/b4005c38619c665aca25709000203b8d/73d48ba2d3c1bb9bca2569de0028b417!OpenDocument   Australian Bureau of Statistics - Year Book Australia, 1920]</ref> both not being acquired until the 20th century.

In addition to the main Victorian rail network of the Victorian Railways and successors, a number of narrow gauge private railways and tramways have also existed for logging and mining purposes. These included the [[Yallourn 900mm Railway]] in the [[Latrobe Valley]] open cut coal mines, the [[Fyansford Cement Works Railway]] near [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], the [[Tyers Valley Tramway]] at [[Mount Baw Baw]], and the [[Powelltown Tramway]] from [[Yarra Junction, Victoria|Yarra Junction]]. 

Most logging tramways operated in the [[Otway Ranges]], [[Gippsland]],<ref name="lr">{{cite web

==Railway preservation==
{{MelbourneTouristTrainLines}}

Organised [[railway preservation]] commenced in Victoria with the formation of the [[Puffing Billy Railway, Melbourne|Puffing Billy Preservation Society]] in 1955, and operating under the [[Emerald Tourist Railway Board]] from 1977.<ref>{{cite web | title = Preservation | work = Puffing Billy | url = http://www.puffingbilly.com.au/fan/heritage/histpbps.htm | format = HTML | accessdate = 2008-02-19 }}</ref> Formed to operate the [[Narrow gauge lines of the Victorian Railways|narrow gauge]] 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) gauge railway in the [[Dandenong Ranges]] near [[Melbourne]], the group continues to operate the railway today.

The demise of the last of the [[steam locomotive]]s in Victoria commenced in the 1960s, with the [[Australian Railway Historical Society]] and [[Association of Railway Enthusiasts]] working with the [[Victorian Railways]] to have a number of locomotives preserved for the future.<ref>{{cite book

By the 1980s a number of [[heritage railway]]s had been established in Victoria on closed [[branch lines]]. These railways serve both as tourist attractions, and to preserve the railway past. The work of railway preservation groups has since expanded to retired railway carriages, electric multiple units, rail motors, and diesel locomotives. In 2006 heritage railways carried 542,000 patrons over 161&nbsp;km of track; with 28 operational steam locomotives, 47 diesels, 14 railmotors, and 192 carriages.<ref>{{cite web | title = Statistics for Heritage and Tourist Railways in Victoria
