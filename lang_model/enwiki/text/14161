The '''Nabataeans''' ({{lang-ar|'''<U+0627><U+0644><U+0623><U+0646><U+0628><U+0627><U+0637>'''}} / [[ALA-LC Romanization|ALA-LC]]: {{transl|ar|ALA|''Al-Anb<U+0101><U+1E6D>''}}) were an ancient [[Semitic]] people, [[Arabs]] of southern [[Jordan]], [[Canaan]] and the northern part of [[Arabia]], whose oasis settlements in the time of [[Josephus]] (AD 37&nbsp;<U+2013> c. 100), gave the name of '''''Nabatene''''' to the borderland between [[Syria]] and [[Arabia]], from the [[Euphrates]] to the [[Red Sea]]. Their loosely-controlled trading network, which centered on strings of oases that they controlled, where agriculture was intensively practiced in limited areas, and on the routes that linked them, had no securely defined boundaries in the surrounding desert. [[Trajan]] conquered the [[Nabataean kingdom]], annexing it to the [[Roman Empire]], where their individual culture, easily identified by their characteristic finely-potted painted ceramics, became dispersed in the general Greco-Roman culture and was eventually lost.

==Culture==
Many examples of graffiti and inscriptions&nbsp;<U+2014> largely of names and greetings&nbsp;<U+2014> document the area of Nabataean culture, which extended as far north as the north end of the [[Dead Sea]], and testify to widespread literacy; but no Nabataean literature has survived, nor was any noted in antiquity,<ref>The carbonized Petra scrolls, mostly economic documents in Greek, date to the 6th century: Glen L. Peterman, "Discovery of Papyri in Petra", ''The Biblical Archaeologist'' '''57'''.1 (March 1994), pp. 55<U+2013>57; P.M. Bikai, "The Petra Papyri" ''Studies in the History and Archaeology of Jordan'', 1997; Marjo Lehtinen, "Petra Papyri" ''Near Eastern Archaeology'' '''65''.,4  (December 2002), pp. 277<U+2013>278.</ref> and the temples bear no inscriptions. [[Onomastic]] analysis has suggested <ref>M.C.A. Macdonald , "Personal names in the Nabataean realm: a review article", ''Journal of Semitic Studies'', 1999.</ref> that the Nabataean culture may have embraced multiple ethnicities. Classical references to the Nabataeans begin with [[Diodorus Siculus]]; they suggest that the Nabataeans' trade routes and the origins of their goods were regarded as trade secrets, and disguised in tales that should have strained outsiders' credulity. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (book ii) described them as a strong tribe of some 10,000 warriors, pre-eminent among the nomads of Arabia, eschewing agriculture, fixed houses, and the use of wine, but adding to pastoral pursuits a profitable trade with the seaports in [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] and spices from [[Arabia Felix]] (today's [[Yemen]]), as well as a trade with [[Egypt]] in [[bitumen]] from the [[Dead Sea]]. Their arid country was their best safeguard, for the bottle-shaped cisterns for rain-water which they excavated in the rocky or clay-rich soil were carefully concealed from invaders.<ref>J.W. Eadie, J.P. Oleson, "The Water-Supply Systems of Nabataean and Roman <U+1E24>umayma" ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'', 1986.</ref>

The extent of Nabataean trade resulted in cross-cultural influences that reached as far as the [[Red Sea]] coast of southern Arabia. The gods worshipped at Petra were headed by [[Dushara]] and [[Uzza|al-Uzza]].

==Origins==

The [[Babylonian captivity]] of Hebrews that began in [[586 BC]] opened a power vacuum in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and as [[Edom]]ites moved into [[Judea|Judaean]] grazing lands, Nabataean inscriptions began to be left in Edomite territory. The first definite appearance was in 312 BC, when they were attacked at [[Petra]] without success by [[Antigonus I]]; at that time Hieronymus of Cardia, a Seleucid officer, mentioned the Nabateans in a battle report. About 50 BC, the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] cited Hieronymus in his report,{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} and added the following: "Just as the Seleucids had tried to subdue them, so the Romans made several attempts to get their hands on that lucrative trade."{{Citation needed |date=February 2010}}

[[Petra]] or [[Sela]] was the ancient capital of [[Edom]]; the Nabataeans must have occupied the old [[Edomite]] country, and succeeded to its commerce, after the Edomites took advantage of the Babylonian captivity to press forward into southern [[Judea|Judaea]]. This migration, the date of which cannot be determined, also made them masters of the shores of the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and the important harbor of [[Elath]]. Here, according to [[Agatharchides]], they were for a time very troublesome, as wreckers and pirates, to the reopened commerce between Egypt and the East, until they were chastised by the [[Ptolemies|Ptolemaic rulers of Alexandria]].{{Citation needed |date=February 2010}}

The Nabataeans had already some tincture of foreign culture when they first appear in history. That culture was naturally [[Aramaic]]; they wrote a letter to Antigonus in [[Syriac]] letters, and Aramaic continued to be the language of their coins and inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom, and profited by the decay of the [[Seleucids]] to extend its borders northward over the more fertile country east of the [[Jordan]]. They occupied [[Hauran]], and in about [[85 BC]] their king [[Aretas III]] became lord of [[Damascus]] and [[Coele-Syria]]. ''Nabataeans'' became the Arabic name for [[Aramaean]]s, whether in [[Syria]] or [[Iraq]], a fact which has been incorrectly held to prove that the Nabataeans were originally Aramaean immigrants from [[Babylonia]]. Proper names on their inscriptions suggest that they were true [[Arab]]s who had come under Aramaic influence. Starcky identifies the Nabatu of southern Arabia (Pre-[[Khalan]] migration) as their ancestors. However different groups amongst the Nabateans wrote their names in slightly different ways, consequently archeologists are reluctant to say that they were all the same tribe, or that any one group is the original Nabataeans<ref>- [http://nabataea.net/nab6.html Nabataea.net, Dan Gibson's comprehensive Nabataean site]</ref>.

==Language==
{{Main|Nabataean language}}
The language of the Nabataean inscriptions, attested from the 2nd century BCE, shows a local development of the [[Aramaic language]], which had ceased to have super-regional importance after the collapse of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] ([[330 BC]]). The [[Nabataean alphabet]] itself also developed out of the [[Aramaic alphabet]].

This Aramaic dialect was increasingly affected by the [[Old North Arabian|Arabic]] dialect of the local population. From the 4th century AD, the Arabic influence becomes overwhelming, in a way that it may be said the Nabataean language shifted seamlessly from Aramaic to Arabic. The [[Arabic alphabet]] itself developed out of cursive variants of the Nabataean script in the 5th century.

==Agriculture==
Although not as dry as at present, the area occupied by the Nabateans was still a desert and required special systems for agriculture.  One system was to contour an area of land into a shallow funnel and to plant a single fruit tree in the middle.  Before the '[[rainy season]]' which could easily consist of only one or two rain events, the area around the tree was broken up.  When the rain came, all the water which collected in the funnel would flow down toward the fruit tree and sink into the ground.  The ground, which was largely [[loess]], would seal up when it got wet and retain the water.

In the mid-1950s, a research team headed by M. Evenari set up a research station near Avdat (Evenari, Shenan and Tadmor 1971). He focused on the relevance of runoff rainwater management in explaining the mechanism of the ancient agricultural features, such as: terraced wadis, channels for collecting runoff rainwater, and the enigmatic phenomenon of "[[Tuleilat el-Anab]]". Evenari showed that the runoff rainwater collection systems concentrate water from an area that is five times larger than the area in which the water actually drains.

Another study was conducted by Y. Kedar in 1957, which also focused on the mechanism of the agriculture systems, but he studied soil management, and claimed that the ancient agriculture systems were intended to increase the accumulation of [[loess]] in wadis and create an infrastructure for agricultural activity. This theory has also been explored by Prof. E. Mazor, of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]].

==The Hellenistic and Roman periods==

{{details|Petra}}
[[Petra]] was rapidly built in the first century BC in Hellenistic splendor, and developed a population estimated at 20,000<ref>''Petra: Lost City of Stone''</ref>

The Nabataeans were allies of the first [[Hasmoneans]] in their struggles against the [[Seleucid]] monarchs. They then became rivals of the Judaean dynasty in the period of its splendor, and a chief element in the disorders which invited [[Pompey]]'s intervention in [[Judea]]. Many Nabataeans were forcefully converted to Judaism by the [[Hasmonean]] king Alexander Jannaeus<ref>- Johnson, Paul, ''A History of the Jews'', George Weidenfeld & Nicolson Limited, London, 1987</ref>. It was this King who after putting down a local rebellion invaded and occupied the Nabatean towns of [[Moab]] and [[Gilead]] and imposed a tribute of an unspecified amount. [[Obodas I]] knew that Alexander would attack, so was able to ambush Alexander's forces near [[Gaulane]] destroying the Judean army (90 BC) <ref>[[Josephus]]The Jewish war 1:87 pg 40 Translated by G.A.Williamson 1959, printed 1981 </ref>.

The Roman military was not very successful in their campaigns against the Nabataeans. In [[62 BC]] [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] accepted a bribe of 300 [[talent (weight)|talents]] to lift the siege of Petra, partly because of the difficult terrain and the fact Scaurus had run out of food provisions. Hyrcanus who was a friend of Aretas was dispached by Scaurus to the King to buy peace. In so obtaining peace King Aretas retained his whole possessions, including Damascus and became a Roman vassal<ref> Josephus 1:61 Pg48</ref>.

During the King Malichus II reign, in 32 BC [[Herod the Great]] started a war against Nabatea, with the support of [[Cleopatra]]. The war started with Herod's army plundering Nabataea and with a large cavalry force, and the occupation of [[Dion, Palestine|Dium]]. After this defeat the Nabatean forces amassed near [[Canatha]] in [[Syria]], but were attacked and routed. [[Athenio]] (Cleopatra's General) sent Canathans to the aid of the Nabateans, and this force crushed Herod's army which then fled to [[Ormiza]]. One year later, Herod's army overran Nabataea.<ref> Josephus 1:363<U+2013>377 pg 75<U+2013>77 </ref>
[[Image:Nabatean Pillars Bosra.jpg|thumb|left|Colossal Nabatean columns stand in [[Bosra]], Syria]]
After an earthquake in Judea, the Nabateans rebelled and invaded Israel, but Herod at once crossed the Jordan river to Philadelphia (modern [[Amman]]) and both sides set up camp. The Nabateans under [[Elthemus]] refused to give battle, so Herod forced the issue when he attacked their [[Palisade|camp]]. A confused mass of Nabateans gave battle but were defeated. Once the defeated had retreated to their defences, Herod laid siege to the camp and over time some of the defenders surrendered. The remaining Nabatean forces offered 500 talents for peace but this was rejected. Lacking water, the Nabateans were forced out of their camp for battle, but were defeated in this last battle.<ref> Josephus 1:377<U+2013>391 pg 78<U+2013>79 </ref>

An ally of the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Nabataean kingdom]] continued to flourish throughout the first century. Its power extended far into Arabia along the [[Red Sea]] to [[Yemen]], and [[Petra]] was a cosmopolitan marketplace, though its commerce was diminished by the rise of the Eastern trade-route from [[Myoshormus]] to [[Coptos]] on the [[Nile]]. Under the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' they lost their warlike and nomadic habits, and were a sober, acquisitive, orderly people, wholly intent on trade and agriculture.

The kingdom was a bulwark between Rome and the wild hordes of the desert but for [[Trajan]], who reduced [[Petra]] and broke up the Nabataean nationality as the short-lived Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]].

By the third century the Nabateans had stopped writing in [[Aramaic]] and begun writing in Greek instead, and by the fourth century they had converted to Christianity<ref>- [http://www.nabateans.org/ Avraham Negev, ''The Nabateans'']</ref>. The new Arab invaders who soon pressed forward into their seats found the remnants of the Nabataeans transformed into-- [[peasants]]. Their lands were divided between the new [[Qahtanite]] Arab tribal kingdoms of the [[Byzantine]] vassals the [[Ghassanid]] Arabs and the [[Himyarite]] vassals the [[Kindah]] Arab Kingdom in North Arabia.

The city of Petra was brought to the attention of Westerners by the Swiss explorer [[Johann Ludwig Burckhardt]] in 1812.
