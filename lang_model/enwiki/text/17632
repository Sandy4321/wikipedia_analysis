==Plot==
After years of hosting the scariest haunted house in the neighborhood for years, [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] finds himself outdone by his neighbor Buckle. [[Francine Smith|Francine]] makes things worse when she finds herself returning and declares that it is impossible to beat him. Depressed, Stan goes to [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]] for advice and Roger suggests he use his [[CIA]] influence to get real body parts and instruments. Stan decides to pull in five of the most dangerous [[serial killer|serial killers]] in the area. However, the killers sitting in their cell fail to scare anyone so Roger tries to make them scarier. First he gets them riled up (by ripping off Francine's costume in front of them, leaving her in her bra and panties) and then he turns them loose; forcing Stan, Francine, Roger and Klaus to take cover in the attitc. Stan apologizes for getting them into the mess and Francine admits she should have been more supportive.

Meanwhile, [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve]], Barry and Snot arrive at Toshi's house to go trick or treating, but find Toshi refuses to wear the Samurai costume his mother got him. Mrs. Yoshida asks Steve if they would mind taking Akiko with them and Steve is smitten. Toshi allows them to go out with the condition that they have Akiko back by sundown. Steve keeps her out late and when they find out Toshi is looking for them they flee to the Langley Falls. Taking refuge in a cave under the falls, Steve starts to move in on Akiko until Toshi bursts in wearing full Samurai garb and chases him to Vince Chung's Halloween party where he tells Toshi he is smothering his sister. Toshi agrees and leaves them together where Akiko admits she has a crush on another, younger boy named Doug.

As the serial killers burst into the kitchen, Stan and others flee through the woods to a locked factory, where they are rescued when Toshi arrives and kills all the serial killers with his [[katana]], leaving Roger to take home one of the killers' heads.

The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. Jason Hughes of [[TV Squad]] wrote a mixed review of the episode and noted that "[t]hey should have kept the focus more completely on the holiday, though maybe [Seth] MacFarlane was worried he'd said about all he could about Halloween in three back-to-back episodes." Hughes compared the episode to "horror movies of the old" and said that the episode's "imagination is far better than anything [that] can be seen on television."<ref name="TV Squad">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/11/08/sundays-with-seth-cleveland-show-family-guy-and-american/|title=Sundays With Seth: 'Cleveland Show,' 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad' Recaps|work=''TV Squad''|publisher=AOL, Inc|date=2010-11-08|last=Hughes|first=Jason}}</ref> In a simultaneous review of the episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' and ''Family Guy'' that preceded the episode, Todd VanDerWerff of [[The A.V. Club]] wrote: "As always, it fell to ''American Dad'' to try to prop up the rest of the night, and fortunately, the episode was capable of doing so.
