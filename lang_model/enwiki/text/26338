== History and background ==

{{History of Afghanistan}}

Barakzai  (translation: sons of Barak) is a common ethnic name among the [[Pashtuns]] of [[Afghanistan]]/[[Pakistan]] and it means ("sons of Barak" in Pashto). Barakzai is also a Pashtun tribe in  [[Pakistan]], and more predominantly, in [[Afghanistan]]. There are seven distinct Pashtun tribes named B<U+0101>rakzai, with the Z<U+012B>rak branch of the Abdal Tareen or Bor Tareen - [[Tareen]] - [[Durrani]] tribe being the most important and largest tribe with over 4 million people.<ref name=Iranica>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Balland |first=D. |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Iranica]]|title= B<U+0100>RAKZ<U+012A>|url= http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v3f7/v3f7a059.html|edition= Online Edition|publisher= [[Columbia University]]|location= United States}}</ref>

According to Hyat Khan's history of [[Afghanistan]], from their progenitor Bor Tareen, otherwise known as Abdal, are descended two main divisions: the Zirak and the Panjpai. The term Abdal, however, gradually superseded Bor Tareen and came into special prominence when [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], commonly known as Durrani, began his career of conquest. The [[Achakzai]]s are strictly a branch of the Barakzai but [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], himself an Abdal Tareen, fearing the growing numbers of the Barakzai, separated them from the parent stock,{{Citation needed|date,11th=August 2010|date=August 2010}} since which time they have remained distinct.

[[Barakzai]], more precisely the sub-tribe of [[Mohammadzai]] are often counted to be as one of the [[Lost tribes of Israel]] and are often associated with the [[Tribe of Benjamin]] ({{Hebrew Name|<U+05D1><U+05B4><U+05BC><U+05E0><U+05B0><U+05D9><U+05B8><U+05DE><U+05B4><U+05D9><U+05DF>|Binyamin|Biny<U+0101>m<U+00EE>n}}).

==Politics==
From 1826 to 1978, most rulers of Afghanistan belonged to the two branches of one [[Barakzai dynasty]] descending from the chiefs of the [[Barakzai]] tribe (belonging to the [[Mohammadzai]] sub-tribe).<ref name="countrystudies.us">[http://countrystudies.us/afghanistan/38.htm Afghanistan - Ethnic Groups<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Languages==
The principal language of Barakzai is [[Pashto]].  Formerly, [[Persian language|Persian]] was used as the language for records and correspondence; until the late nineteenth century tombstones were also inscribed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. The language of the Barakzai tribes in [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]], [[Quetta]], [[Gulistan, Balochistan|Gulistan]] and Dukki (Distt. Loralai) is just like the language spoken in [[Kandahar]]. Those who have settled away from Pishin speak local languages (Pushto), such as [[Multani language|Multani]] or [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] in [[Multan]], [[Hindko]] in [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Urdu]] in [[Bhopal]] and [[Sindhi]] in [[Sindh]].  [[Barakzai]], a dialect of [[Pashto]], is the language spoken by [[Harnai]] Barakzai.
