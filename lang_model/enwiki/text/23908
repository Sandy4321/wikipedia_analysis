'''School shootings in the United States''' are a serious social issue. 

==History of School Shootings in the United States==

===1700s===
The earliest known [[United States]] shooting to happen on school property was the [[Pontiac's Rebellion school massacre]] on '''July 26, 1764''', where four [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] entered the schoolhouse near present-day [[Greencastle, Pennsylvania|Greencastle]], Pennsylvania, shot and killed schoolmaster Enoch Brown, and killed nine or ten children (reports vary). Only three children survived.<ref>{{cite book|last=David |first=Dixon |title=Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=2005}}</ref>

* '''November 2, 1853:''' [[Louisville, Kentucky]] A student, Matthew Ward, bought a self-cocking pistol in the morning, went to school and killed Schoolmaster Mr. Butler for excessively punishing his brother the day before. Even though he shot the Schoolmaster point blank in front of his classmates, he was acquitted.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 29, 1854}}</ref>

* An '''April 30, 1866''' editorial in the [[New York Times]] argued against students carrying pistols, citing "...''pistols being dropped on the floor at balls or being exploded in very inconvenient ways.  A boy of 12 has his pantaloons made with a pistol pocket; and this at a boarding-school filled with boys, who, we suppose, do or wish to do the same thing.  We would advise parents to look into it, and learn whether shooting is to be a part of the scholastic course which may be practiced on their boys; or else we advise them to see that their own boys are properly armed with the most approved and deadly-pistol, and that there may be an equal chance at least of their shooting as of being shot.''"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C16FB3D551A7493C2AA178FD85F428684F9 |accessdate=November 16, 2011 |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Carrying Firearms |date=April 30, 1866}}</ref>
