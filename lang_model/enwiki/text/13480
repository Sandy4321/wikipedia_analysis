When World War I and series of revolutions across Europe, including the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, shattered many existing empires such as the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] ones, people of Ukraine were caught in the middle. Between 1917 and 1919, several separate Ukrainian republics manifested independence, the [[anarchist]] [[Free Territory]], the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], and numerous [[Ukrainian SSR|Bolshevik revkoms]].

As the area of Ukraine fell into warfare and anarchy, it was also fought over by [[German Army|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian forces]], the [[Red Army]] of [[Bolshevik Russia]], the [[White Forces]] of [[General Denikin]], the [[Polish Army]], [[anarchist]]s led by [[Nestor Makhno]]. [[Kiev]] itself was occupied by many different armies. The city was captured by the Bolsheviks on 9 February 1918, by the Germans on 2 March 1918, by the Bolsheviks a second time on 5 February 1919, by the White Army on 31 August 1919, by Bolsheviks for a third time on 15 December 1919, by the Polish Army on 6 
May 1920,  and finally by the Bolsheviks for the fourth time on 12 June 1920.

The defeat in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] and then the failure of the [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski|Pi<U+0142>sudski]]'s and [[Symon Petlura|Petliura]]'s ''[[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Warsaw agreement of 1920]]'' to oust the Bolsheviks during the [[Kiev Offensive|Kiev Operation]] led almost to the occupation of Poland itself. In course of the new [[Polish-Soviet War]] purpose of which changed from the 1920 led to the signing of the [[Peace of Riga]] in March 1921, and after which the part of [[Ukraine]] west of [[Zbruch river|Zbruch]] had been incorporated into [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and the east became part of the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

{{see also|Ukrainian_Soviet_Socialist_Republic#interbellum|label 1=Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Interwar years: 1922<U+2013>1939}}
The Ukrainian national idea lived on during the inter-war years and was even spread to a large territory with traditionally mixed population in the east and south that became part of the Ukrainian [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]]. The [[Ukrainian culture]] even enjoyed a revival due to Bolshevik concessions in the early Soviet years (until early-1930s) known as the policy of [[Korenization]] ("indigenisation"). In these years, an impressive [[Ukrainization]] program was implemented throughout the republic.

The rapidly developed Ukrainian language based education system dramatically raised the literacy of the Ukrainophone rural population. Simultaneously, the newly-literate ethnic Ukrainians migrated to the cities, which became rapidly largely Ukrainianised<U+2014>in both population and in education. Similarly expansive was an increase in Ukrainian language publishing and overall eruption of Ukrainian cultural life.

At the same time, the usage of Ukrainian was continuously encouraged in the workplace and in the government affairs as the recruitment of indigenous cadre was implemented as part of the korenisation policies. While initially, the party and government apparatus was mostly Russian-speaking, by the end of 1920s the ethnic Ukrainians composed over one half of the membership in the Ukrainian communist party, the number strengthened by accession of [[Borotbists]], a formerly indigenously Ukrainian "independentist" and non-Bolshevik communist party.

Despite the ongoing [[Soviet Union]]-wide antireligious campaign, the Ukrainian national [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] church was created called the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] (UAOC). The Bolshevik government initially saw the national church as a tool in their goal to suppress the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] always viewed with the great suspicion by the regime for its being the cornerstone of pre-revolutionary [[Russian Empire]] and the initially strong opposition it took towards the regime change. Therefore, the government tolerated the new Ukrainian national church for some time and the UAOC gained a wide following among the Ukrainian peasantry.

[[File:DneproGES.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1934 photo of the [[DnieproGES]] hydropower plant, a heavyweight of Soviet industrialization in Ukraine.]]

The change in the Soviet economic policies towards the fast-pace [[History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953)#Industrialisation in practice|industrialisation]] was marked by the 1928 introduction of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s first [[piatiletka]] (a five-year plan). The industrialisation brought about a dramatic economic and social transformation in traditionally agricultural Ukraine. In the first piatiletkas the industrial output of Ukraine quadrupled as the republic underwent a record industrial development. The massive influx of the rural population to the industrial centres increased the urban population from 19% to 34%.

==== Soviet collectivisation ====

{{Further|Collectivization in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic}}

However, the industrialisation had a heavy cost for the peasantry, demographically a backbone of the Ukrainian nation. To satisfy the state's need for increased food supplies and finance industrialisation, Stalin instituted a [[Collectivization in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|program of collectivisation]] of agriculture, which profoundly affected Ukraine, often referred to as the "breadbasket of the USSR". In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the state combined the peasants' lands and animals into collective farms. Starting in 1929, a policy of enforcement was applied, using regular troops and secret police to confiscate lands and materials where necessary.

Many resisted, and a desperate struggle by the peasantry against the authorities ensued. Some slaughtered their livestock rather than turn it over to the collectives. Wealthier peasants were labeled "[[kulak]]s", enemies of the state. Tens of thousands were executed and about 100,000 families were [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]] and Kazakhstan.

For example, in the [[Moldavian SSR]], only [[Transnistria]] have been affected by the Holodomor. In the Odessa Oblast, the [[Bugeac]] was not affected by the Holodomor.]] -->
Forced collectivisation had a devastating effect on agricultural productivity. Despite this, in 1932 the Soviet government increased Ukraine's production quotas by 44%, ensuring that they could not be met. Soviet law required that the members of a collective farm would receive no grain until government quotas were satisfied. The authorities in many instances exacted such high levels of procurement from collective farms that starvation became widespread.
[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|Passers-by no longer pay attention to the corpses of starved peasants on a street in [[Kharkiv]], 1933.]]
The [[Soviet famine of 1932<U+2013>33]], called [[Holodomor]] in Ukrainian, claimed up to 10 million Ukrainian lives as peasants' food stocks were forcibly removed by [[Stalin]]'s regime by the [[NKVD]] secret police.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7111296.stm Ukraine remembers famine horror]". BBC News. November 24, 2007.</ref> As elsewhere, the precise number of deaths by starvation in Ukraine may never be precisely known. That said, the most recent demographic studies suggest that over 4 million Ukrainians perished in the first six months of 1933 alone, a figure that increases if population losses from 1931, 1932 and 1934 are also included, along with those from adjacent territories inhabited primarily by Ukrainians (but politically part of the Russian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic).

The Soviet Union suppressed information about this genocide, and as late as the 1980s admitted only that there was some hardship because of kulak sabotage and bad weather. Today, its existence is accepted.{{By whom|date=July 2009}} Non-Soviets maintain that the famine was an avoidable, deliberate act of genocide.

The times of industrialisation and collectivisation also brought about a wide campaign against "nationalist deviation" which in Ukraine translated into an assault on the national political and cultural elite. The first wave of purges between 1929 and 1934 targeted the revolutionary generation of the party that in Ukraine included many supporters of [[Ukrainization]]. [[Great Purge|The next 1936<U+2013>1938 wave of political purges]] eliminated much of the new political generation that replaced those that perished in the first wave and halved the membership of the Ukrainian communist party.<ref name=Britannica>Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine Ukraine] article, page 51.</ref>

The purged Ukrainian political leadership was largely replaced by the cadre sent from [[Russian SFSR|Russia]] that was also largely "rotated" by Stalin's purges. As the policies of Ukrainisation were halted (1931) and replaced by massive [[Russification]] approximately four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite, intellectuals, writers, artists and clergy, had been "eliminated", executed or imprisoned, in the following decade.<ref name="Britannica"/> Mass arrests of the hierarchy and clergy of the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]] culminated in the liquidation of the church in 1930.

====Galicia and Volhynia under Polish rule====

{{Main|History of Poland (1918<U+2013>1939)}}
{{See also|Treaty of Warsaw (1920)}}

Following the end of World War I, the eastern part of the former Austrian province of [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], as well as [[Volhynia]], which had belonged to the [[Russian Empire]], became the area of a [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]. The Ukrainians claimed these lands because they made up the majority of population there (except for cities, such as [[Lviv]]), while the Poles saw these provinces as [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]], a [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth|historical part of their country]]. The war was won by the Poles, and their rule over these disputed lands was cemented after another [[Treaty of Riga|Polish victory]], in the [[Polish-Soviet War]].

In the interbellum period, eastern Galicia was divided into three [[voivodeship|administrative units]] <U+2014> [[Lw<U+00F3>w Voivodeship]], [[Stanis<U+0142>aw<U+00F3>w Voivodeship]], and [[Tarnopol Voivodeship]], while in Volhynia, [[Wo<U+0142>y<U+0144> Voivodeship (1921<U+2013>1939)|Wo<U+0142>y<U+0144> Voivodeship]] was created. The Ukrainian majority of these lands were further oppressed by the Polish authorities, and the conflict escalated in the 1930s,  due in part to actions of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. The tensions were further exacerbated by arrival of thousands of [[osadnik]]s, or Polish settlers, who were granted land, especially in Volhynia.

Polish rule over the provinces ended in September 1939, following [[Polish September Campaign|Nazi and Soviet attack]]. After [[Battle of Lvov (1939)|Battle of Lwow]], units of the [[Red Army]] entered regional capital, Lviv, and following [[Elections to the People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus]], both eastern Galicia and Volhynia were annexed by the [[Soviet Union]].

A few days after the Germans invaded Poland, Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] told an aide his long-term goal was the spread of Communism in Eastern Europe: 
:"Now [Poland] is a fascist state, oppressing the Ukrainians, Belorussians and so forth. The annihilation of that state under current conditions would mean one fewer bourgeois fascist state to contend with! What would be the harm if as a result of the rout off Poland we were to extend the socialist system onto new territories and populations."<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Roberts|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939-1953|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xlRjy4qnH6cC&pg=PA36|year=2006|publisher=Yale U.P.|page=36}}</ref>

Geoffrey Roberts notes that the comments marked a change from the previous "popular front" policy of Communist Party cooperation with other parties. He adds, "Stalin's immediate purpose was to present an ideological rationale for the Red Army's forthcoming invasion of Poland" and his main message was the need to avoid a revolutionary civil war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roberts|title=Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939-1953|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xlRjy4qnH6cC&pg=PA36||pages=36<U+2013>37}}</ref>

Historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]] suggests that, "Stalin may have reasoned that returning Galicia and Volhynia to Soviet Ukraine would help co-opt Ukrainian nationalism. Stalin perhaps saw a way to give both Ukrainians and Poles something they wanted, while binding them to the USSR."<ref>{{cite book|author=Timothy Snyder|title=The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xSpEynLxJ1MC&pg=PA182|year=2003|publisher=Yale UP|page=182}}</ref>

===World War II===
[[File:Ukrainian SSR 1940.jpg|thumb|350px|Ukrainian SSR in 1940, after the Soviet invasions of [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Poland]] and [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and before the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of Soviet Union]].]]
[[File:Ukraine-growth.png|thumb|350px|The formation of the territory of Ukraine.]]

Following the [[Ribbentrop-Molotov pact]], in September 1939, German and Soviet troops [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|divided the territory of Poland]], including [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] with its Ukrainian population. Next, after [[Battle of France|France surrendered]] to Germany, [[Romania]] ceded [[Bessarabia]] and northern [[Bukovina]] to [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|Soviet demands]]. The Ukrainian SSR incorporated northern and southern districts of Bessarabia, the northern Bukovina, and additionally the Soviet-occupied [[Hertsa region]], but ceded the western part of the [[Moldavian ASSR]] to the newly created [[Moldavian SSR]]. All these territorial gains were internationally recognized by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]].

When [[Nazi Germany]] with [[Axis forces|its allies]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941, many Ukrainians and Polish people, particularly in the west where they had experienced two years of harsh Soviet rule, initially regarded the [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers as liberators. Some Ukrainian activist of the national movement hoped for a momentum to establish an independent state of Ukraine. German policies initially gave some encouragement to such hopes through the vague promises of sovereign 'Greater Ukraine' as the Germans were trying to take advantage of anti-Soviet, anti-Ukrainian, anti-Polish, and anti-Jewish sentiments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luciuk| first=Lubomyr Y.|title=Searching for place: Ukrainian displaced persons, Canada, and the migration of memory|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|page=125|isbn=0-8020-4245-7|url=  http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&vid=ISBN080208088X&id=6srpcaGeuvcC&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=ukrainians+under+germans&sig=OTTMYCLmt0qe9mtdMFqPUPVKRYM#v=onepage&q=ukrainians%20under%20germans&f=false}}</ref> A local Ukrainian auxiliary police was formed as well as Ukrainian SS division, [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia (1st Ukrainian)]]. However, after the initial period of a limited tolerance, the German policies soon abruptly changed and the Ukrainian national movement was brutally crushed.

Some Ukrainians, however, utterly resisted the Nazi onslaught from its start and a [[Soviet partisans|partisan movement]] immediately spread over the occupied territory. Some elements of the Ukrainian nationalist underground formed a [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] that fought both Soviet and Nazi forces. In some western regions of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army survived underground and continued the resistance against the Soviet authorities well into the 1950s, though many Ukrainian civilians were murdered in this conflict by both sides.

[[File:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|250px|Burned out buildings in Kiev during the Second World War.]]
The Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population's possible dissatisfaction with Soviet political and economic policies. Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out genocidal policies against Jews, and deported many Ukrainians to forced labour in Germany. In their active resistance to Nazi Germany, the Ukrainians comprised a significant share of the Red Army and its leadership as well as the underground and resistance movements.
Total civilian losses during the War and German occupation in Ukraine are estimated at seven million, including over a million Jews shot and killed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''.

Many civilians fell victim to atrocities, forced labor, and even massacres of whole villages in reprisal for attacks against Nazi forces. Of the estimated eleven million Soviet troops who fell in battle against the Nazis, about 16% (1.7 million) were ethnic Ukrainians. Moreover, Ukraine saw some of the biggest battles of the war starting with the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|encirclement of Kiev]] (the city itself fell to the Germans on 19 September 1941 and was later acclaimed as a ''[[Hero City]]'') where more than 660,000 Russian troops were taken captive, to the fierce defence of [[Odessa]], and on to the victorious storming across the [[Dnieper river]]. According to the researcher Rolf Michaelis who is referring to the [[SS-Hauptamt]]'s document No. 8699/42, the [[Polizei-Bataillon "Ostland"|Police Battalion "Ostland"]] (Field Post Number 47769) resided in the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]] in 1941-1942, and was one of the main executioners of the [[Jew]]s. The Police Battalion "Ostland" was an [[Ordnungspolizei]] unit that served in [[World War II]] under the command of the [[Schutzstaffel]]. The battalion established in October 1941 carried out [[Anti-partisan operations in World War II|punitive duties]].<ref>Massimo Arico, Ordnungspolizei - Encyclopedia of the German police battalions September 1939 - July 1942, p. 144-145.</ref>

On June 28, 1941 the town of [[Rivne]] (R<U+00F3>wne) was captured by [[Nazi Germany]], which later established the city as the administrative centre of the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]. In July 1941 the 1st company of the Police Battalion "Ostland" was in [[Frankfurt]], the rest of the battalion was in [[Rivne]]. In October 1941 the battalion was sent to [[Lviv]] (Lw<U+00F3>w). At the time, roughly half of R<U+00F3>wne's inhabitants were [[Jewish]]. About 23,000 of these people were taken to a pine grove in [[Sosenki]] and slaughtered by the 1st company of the Police Battalion "Ostland" between the November 6, and 8, 1941 (1st company). A [[ghetto]] was established for the remaining ca 5,000 Jews.<ref name="Rolf Michaelis 1945">Rolf Michaelis, ''Der Einsatz der Ordnungspolizei 1939-1945. Polizei-Bataillone, SS-Polizei-Regimenter''.

Kiev was recaptured by the Soviet Red Army on 6 November 1943.

During a period of March 1943 to the end of 1944 [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] committed several massacres on Polish civilian population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia having every signs of genocide ([[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]]).

After World War II some amendments to the Constitution of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] were accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of [[international law]] in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of founding members of the [[United Nations]] (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]]. This was part of a deal with the [[United States]] to ensure a degree of balance in the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. In its capacity as a member of the UN, the Ukrainian SSR was [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|an elected member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] in 1948<U+2013>1949 and 1984<U+2013>1985.

Over the next decades, the Ukrainian republic not only surpassed pre-war levels of industry and production but also was the spearhead of Soviet power. Ukraine became the centre of Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research. The republic was also turned into a Soviet military outpost in the [[cold war]], a territory crowded by military bases packed with the most up-to-date weapons systems.

Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite. Many members of the Soviet leadership came from Ukraine, most notably [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]] a Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982, as well as many prominent Soviet sportsmen, scientists and artists. In 1954, the [[Russians|Russian]]-populated oblast of [[Crimea]] was transferred from the Russian to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic.

However, the relatively underdeveloped industrial branches such as [[coal mining|coal]]- and [[iron ore]] mining, [[metallurgy]], [[chemical industry|chemical]] and [[energy industry]] dominated the republic's economy. Once a [[Cossack]] steppe, the southern oblasts of [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia]] were turned into a highly industrialised area with rapidly increasing impact on its environment and public health. A pursuit to energy production sufficient for growing industry led to the gigantic nature-remastering: turning the [[Dnieper River]] into a regulated system of large reservoirs.

The products of the rapidly developed [[high-tech]] industry in Ukraine were largely directed for military consumption, similarly to much of the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]], and the supply and quality of [[consumer goods]] remained low compared even to the neighboring countries of the [[Eastern bloc]]. A state-regulated system of production and consumption lead to gradual decrease of quality of life and growing "shadowisation" of retail infrastructure as well as of corruption.

The town of [[Pripyat, Ukraine]] was the site of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], which occurred on April 26, 1986 when a nuclear plant exploded. The fallout contaminated large areas of northern Ukraine and even parts of [[Belarus]]. This spurred on a local independence movement called the [[People's Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]] that helped expedite the break-up of the Soviet Union during the late 1980s.

===Independent Ukraine (1991 to present)===
{{expand section|date=September 2013}}

==== Kravchuk and Kuchma rule (1991<U+2013>2004) ====
On January 21, 1990, over 300,000 Ukrainians<ref name="subtelny-576">{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=Subtelny, Orest|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year= 2000|isbn=0-8020-8390-0|page=576|authorlink= Orest Subtelny}}</ref> organised a human chain for Ukrainian independence between [[Kiev]] and [[Lviv]], in [[Act Zluky|memory of the 1919 unification]] of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[West Ukrainian National Republic]]. Citizens came out to the streets and highways, forming live chains by holding hands in support of unity.

Ukraine officially [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared itself an independent state on August 24, 1991]], when the communist Supreme Soviet (parliament) of Ukraine proclaimed that Ukraine will no longer follow the laws of USSR and only the laws of the Ukrainian SSR, de facto declaring Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union. On December 1, Ukrainian voters overwhelmingly approved a [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|referendum formalising independence from the Soviet Union]]. Over 90% of Ukrainian citizens voted for independence, with majorities in every region, including 56% in [[Crimea]], which had a 75% ethnic Russian population. The Soviet Union formally ceased to exist on December 26, when the presidents of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia (the founding members of the USSR) met in [[Belovezh Pushcha]] to formally dissolve the Union in accordance with the Soviet Constitution. And with this Ukraine's independence was formalized de jure and recognised by the international community.

[[Poland]] and [[Canada]] were the first countries to recognize Ukraine's independence (both) on 2 December 1991.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LNvTSDQXFXgC&pg=PA100&dq=recognize+first+Ukraine's+independence+Poland&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=PaoVUfvIH8LO0QXsnYCYDQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=recognize%20first%20Ukraine's%20independence%20Poland&f=false Ukraine and Russia: The Post-Soviet Transition] by [[Roman Solchanyk]], [[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]], 2000, ISBN 0742510182 (page 100)<br>[http://books.google.com/books?id=atpMYRcYBM4C&pg=PA371&dq=December+1991+recognize+Ukraine's+independence+Canada&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=KKgVUenPLpS00QXv-YGgBA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=December%201991%20recognize%20Ukraine's%20independence%20Canada&f=false Canadian Yearbook of International Law, Vol 30, 1992], [[University of British Columbia Press]], 1993, ISBN 9780774804387 (page 371)<br>[http://books.google.com/books?id=oLWeUoWEAGgC&pg=PA355&dq=recognize+Ukraine's+independence+Poland&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=6KoVUbzLBuyW0QWl2IGYBw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=recognize%20Ukraine's%20independence%20Poland&f=false Russia, Ukraine, and the Breakup of the Soviet Union] by [[Roman Szporluk]], [[Hoover Institution Press]], 2000, ISBN 0817995420 (page 355)</ref>

The history of Ukraine between 1991 and 2004 was marked by the presidencies of [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]]. This was a time of transition for Ukraine. While it had attained nominal independence from Russia, its presidents maintained close ties with their neighbours.

On June 1, 1996, Ukraine became a non-nuclear nation when it sent the last of its 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads it had inherited from the Soviet Union to Russia for dismantling.;<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0773520872 Power versus Prudence: Why Nations Forgo Nuclear Weapons] by [[T. V. Paul]], [[McGill-Queen's University Press]], 2000, ISBN 978-0-7735-2087-5, page 117</ref> Ukraine had committed to this by signing the [[Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances]] in January 1994.<ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1574885855 Tactical Nuclear Weapons: Emergent Threats in an Evolving Security Environment] by Brian Alexander, [[Brassey's US]], 2003, ISBN 978-1-57488-585-9, page 139</ref>

The country adopted its [[Constitution_of_Ukraine|constitution]] on June 28, 1996.

The [[Cassette Scandal]] of 2000 was one of the turning points in post-independence history of the country.

====Orange Revolution (2004)====
[[File:Joesjtsjenko Marion Kiev 2004.jpg|thumb|Protesters at [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Independence Square]] on the first day of the Orange Revolution.]]
{{main|Orange Revolution}}
In 2004, Leonid Kuchma announced that he would not run for re-election. Two major candidates emerged in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. [[Viktor Yanukovych]], the incumbent Prime Minister, supported by both Kuchma and by the Russian Federation, wanted closer ties with Russia. The main opposition candidate, [[Viktor Yushchenko]], called for Ukraine to turn its attention westward and eventually join the EU.

In the runoff election, Yanukovych officially won by a narrow margin, but Yushchenko and his supporters cried foul, alleging that vote rigging and intimidation cost him many votes, especially in eastern Ukraine. A political crisis erupted after the opposition started massive street [[Orange Revolution|protests in Kiev and other cities]], and the [[Supreme Court of Ukraine]] ordered the election results null and void. A second runoff found [[Viktor Yushchenko]] the winner. Five days later, [[Viktor Yanukovych]] resigned from office and his cabinet was dismissed on January 5, 2005.

====Yushchenko rule====
In March 2006, the [[Verkhovna Rada]] [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|elections]] took place and three months later the official government was formed by the "[[Anti-Crisis Coalition]]" among the ''[[Party of Regions]]'', ''[[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communist]]'', and ''[[Socialist Party of Ukraine|Socialist]]'' parties. The latter party switched from the "Orange Coalition" with ''[[Our Ukraine Bloc/Our Ukraine<U+2013>People's Self-Defense Bloc|Our Ukraine]]'', and the ''[[Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc]]''. The new coalition nominated Viktor Yanukovych for the post of Prime Minister. Yanukovych once again became Prime Minister, while the leader of the Socialist Party, [[Oleksander Moroz]], managed to secure the position of chairman of parliament, which is believed by many to have been the reason for his leaving the Orange Coalition, where he had not been considered for this position.

On April 2, 2007, President Yushchenko dissolved the Verkhovna Rada because members of his party were defecting to the opposition.<ref>Steven Lee Myers Published: May 31, 2007, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/31/america/kiev.php Confusion, chaos and comedy in Ukrainian politics] International Herald Tribune</ref> His opponents called the move unconstitutional. When they took the matter to the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]], Yushchenko dismissed 3 of the court's 18 judges, accusing them of corruption.

During the Yushchenko term, relations between Russia and Ukraine often appeared strained as Yushchenko looked towards improved relations with the European Union and less toward Russia. In 2005, a highly publicized [[Russia-Ukraine gas dispute|dispute over natural gas prices]] took place, involving Russian state-owned gas supplier Gazprom, and indirectly involving many European countries which depend on natural gas supplied by Russia through the Ukrainian pipeline. A compromise was reached in January 2006, and in early 2010 a further agreement was signed locking the price of Russian gas at $100 per 1,000 cubic meters in an exclusive arrangement.

By the time of the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|presidential election of 2010]], Yushchenko and Tymoshenko <U+2014> allies during the Orange Revolution <U+2014> had become bitter enemies. Tymoshenko ran for president against both Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych, creating a three-way race. Yushchenko, whose popularity had plummeted, refused to close ranks and support Tymoshenko, thus dividing the anti-Yanukovych vote. Many pro-Orange voters stayed home.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1963613,00.html Ukraine's New President: Is the Orange Revolution Over?], [[Time.com]] (11 February 2010)</ref> Yanukovych received 48% of the vote and Yushchenko less than 6%, an amount which, if thrown to Tymoshenko, who received 45%, would have prevented Yanukovych from gaining the presidency; since no candidate obtained an absolute majority in the first round of voting the two highest polling candidates contested in a run-off second ballot which Yanukovych won.

During Yanukovych's term he has been accused of [[Freedom of the press in Ukraine#Latest developments|tightening of press restrictions]] and a renewed effort in the parliament to limit freedom of assembly. When young, Yanukovych was sentenced to 3 years because of theft, looting and vandalism and later had his sentenced doubled.<ref>Appleseed Democracy Documentary interview with Ukrainian MP Andriy Schevchenko 6 July 2010</ref><ref name=Umland>[http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/andreas-umland/ukraine-right-wing-politics-is-genie-out-of-bottle Ukraine right-wing politics: is the genie out of the bottle?], [[openDemocracy.net]] (January 3, 2011)</ref><ref name="bbc.co.uk">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12171740 Ukraine viewpoint: Novelist Andrey Kurkov], [[BBC News]] (January 13, 2011)</ref><ref name="bbc.co.uk"/><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12042561 Ukraine ex-PM Tymoshenko charged with misusing funds], [[BBC News]] (December 20, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2010-09-29/party-regions-monopolises-power-ukraine#_ftn5 The Party of Regions monopolises power in Ukraine], [[Centre for Eastern Studies]] (September 29, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12219712 Ukraine launches battle against corruption], [[BBC News]] (January 18, 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11549381 Ukrainians' long wait for prosperity], [[BBC News]] (October 18, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/news-points/ukraine-press-censorship-journalists-uncertain-future Ukraine:Journalists Face Uncertain Future], [[Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting]] (October 27, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/108194/yanukovych-tells-u-k-39-s-cameron-no-fears-for-ukraine-39-s-democracy.html Yanukovych Tells U.K's Cameron No Fears for Ukraine's Democracy], [[Turkish Weekly]] (October 6, 2010)</ref><ref>[http://www.partyofregions.org.ua/eng/pr-east-west/4d394880be20c/ Yulia Kovalevska:Only some bankrupt politicians try to use the Day of Unification with the aim of self-PR], [[Party of Regions]] official website (January 21, 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/19116.html President: Ukraine must fulfill its commitments to Council of Europe], [[president.gov.ua]] (January 13, 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/69573/ Our Ukraine comes to defense of Tymoshenko, Lutsenko, Didenko, Makarenko in statement], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (May 25, 2011)</ref> One frequently-cited example of Yankukovych's alleged attempts to centralize power is the August 2011 arrest of Yulia Tymoshenko.<ref>http://ukraine.usembassy.gov/government-statement-tymoshenko.html  [[US Embassy, Kiev]], (September 24, 2011)</ref><ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14459446 [[BBC News]], (September 24, 2011)</ref> Other high-profile political opponents also came under criminal investigation since.<ref>http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/112105/, [[Kyiv Post]] (September 24, 2011)</ref><ref>http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,736745,00.html, [[Der Spiegel]] (September 24, 2011)</ref><ref>http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/79199/ [[Kyiv Post]] (September 24, 2011)</ref><ref>http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/112081/ [[Kyiv Post]] (September 24, 2011)</ref> On 11 October 2011, a Ukrainian court sentenced Tymoshenko to seven years in prison after she was found guilty of abuse of office when brokering the [[2009 Russia<U+2013>Ukraine gas dispute|2009 gas deal with Russia]].<ref name=BBCOct2011>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15250742 Ukraine ex-PM Yulia Tymoshenko jailed over gas deal], BBC News (11 October 2011)</ref> The conviction is seen as "justice being applied selectively under political motivation" by the [[European Union]] and other international organizations.<ref>[http://www.euronews.net/2011/10/11/eu-feels-let-down-by-ukraine-over-tymoshenko/ EU feels let down by Ukraine over Tymoshenko], [[Euronews]] (11 October 2011)</ref>

Following the violence, the Parliament turned against Yanukovych and on February 22 voted to remove him from power, and to free Yulia Tymoshenko from prison.  The same day Yanukovych supporter Volodymyr Rybak resigned as speaker of the Parliament, and was replaced by Tymoshenko loyalist [[Oleksandr Turchynov]], who was subsequently installed as interim President.<ref>{{cite web
