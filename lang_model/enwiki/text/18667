'''''Millennium'' (season 1)''' was the first season of the American [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] [[Crime (genre)|crime]]-[[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], which  commenced airing in the [[United States]] on October 25, 1996, concluding on May 16, 1997, and consisting of twenty-two episodes. It tells the story of retired FBI Agent [[Frank Black (Millennium)|Frank Black]] ([[Lance Henriksen]]). Black has moved to [[Seattle, Washington]] with his family and has begun working with a mysterious organization known only as the [[Millennium Group]]. He investigates cases with members of the Group and the [[Seattle Police Department]], contributing his remarkable capability of relating to the monsters responsible for horrific crimes. He finds that his [[Jordan Black (Millennium)|daughter]] has inherited the same "gift" that he has, while the cases become increasingly more personal.

Critics received season one well. Although the show got the highest number of viewers for a pilot episode for the Fox Network at the time, it steadily dropped in the ratings, which led to it losing the Sunday slot to its [[sister show]], ''[[The X-Files]]''. The main cast of the show were Henriksen as Frank Black and [[Megan Gallagher]] as [[Catherine Black]].

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The original idea behind ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' came from an episode of ''[[The X-Files]]'' [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] had written about a [[serial killer]]. The episode got Carter thinking about the "monsters" who lurked in the shadows. Later, he started to flesh out a character which would become [[Frank Black (Millennium)|Frank Black]], but he was busy working with other projects at the time. In the mid-90s, after the success of ''The X-Files'', the Fox Network asked Carter if he could create another show for them.<ref name="OrderChaoes">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]], Horton, Ken, [[Frank Spotnitz|Spotnitz, Frank]], [[Lance Henriksen|Henriksen, Lance]], [[Megan Gallagher|Gallagher, Megan]], [[David Nutter|Nutter, David]], [[Mark Snow|Snow, Mark]], Peter Kousakis, John, Freeborn, Mark, [[Robert McLachlan|McLachlan, Robert]], [[Chip Johannessen|Johannessen, Chip]] and [[Thomas J. Wright|J. Wright, Thomas]] |date=2004 |title= Order in Chaos, Making Millennium Season One |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|FOX Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Originally the show was planned to include a new "murder mystery" each week, at the same time having a comprehensive [[storyline]]. So Carter created the idea of the new [[millennium]], which could give the show its own "feel". He felt he "could capitalise" and at the same time have a new murder mystery every week with a "millennial" twist to it.<ref name="OrderChaoes"/> He also wanted to explore "evil", not the "scientific approach" which was the psychological explanation of "evil". Carter wanted to explore evil through an "unscientific approach", an exploration where "the [[Bible]]" played an important role. While clearly stating that the show was not supposed to be heavily grounded in religious text, he felt in many ways that the Bible explained "things on various levels" and "not just in the modern scientific way."<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]] |date=1996 |title= "Pilot" and "Gehenna" documentary (UK: Video Boxset documentary) |medium= DVD |publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|FOX Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>

=== Casting and characters ===
[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] had envisioned [[Lance Henriksen]] portraying the character of [[Frank Black (Millennium)|Frank Black]], long before he was ever contacted. Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the [[Fox Network]] wanted someone younger to take the lead part. Fox asked [[William Hurt]] to play the lead role, but after finding out that Hurt had no interest in acting on [[television]], Henriksen got the part.<ref name="OrderChaoes"/>

When Henriksen first got the script, he mistook it for a film because of its "powerful" story. He was not fond of the idea of participating in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was "How are you going to make this hero a hero? I mean, it is so dark, how are you going to handle this?" Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to "stand-up" against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark "feel" of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel. According to Carter "The yellow house" was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.<ref name="OrderChaoes"/>

Studio executive Ken Horton was very pleased with [[Megan Gallagher]]s acting experiences. After winning the audition, she was given a "secret script". Reacting positively towards the script, she later met up with Carter and [[David Nutter]].<ref name="OrderChaoes"/>

== Critical reception ==
Peter Wunstorf was nominated for an [[American Society of Cinematographers|American Society of Cinematographers award]] for his work on the [[Millennium (pilot episode)|pilot episode]].<ref name="OrderChaoes"/> [[Lance Henriksen]] was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his portrayal of [[Frank Black (Millennium)|Frank Black]] but lost to ''[[ER (TV series)|E.R.]]'' performer, [[Anthony Edwards]].<ref name="OrderChaoes"/> Co-star [[Brittany Tiplady]] was later nominated for a [[Young Artist Award]] but failed to win.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms19.htm |title=Nineteenth Annual Youth in Film Awards 1996-1997 |first=|last=|date=|accessdate=September 28, 2009 |publisher=[[Young Artist Awards]]}}</ref> The show itself was nominated for a [[People's Choice Award]] in the category "Favorite Television New Dramatic Series" but did not win.

The first season was received well by critics. Keith Uhlich of [[Salon (magazine)|''Salon'' magazine]] called the season and series "Carter's greatest series", and that, "television work always improves in retrospect; his seemingly haphazard, on-the-fly narratives become more coherent when taken out of the hellish, commercial break-happy context wherein they spawned".<ref>{{cite news | author=Uhlich, Keith | url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/dvd_review.asp?ID=408 | title=Millennium: The Complete First Season | publisher=[[Salon (magazine)|''Salon'' magazine]] | date=July 25, 2004 | accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> Paul Katz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "Despite the unapologetic bleakness" of the show, it was [[Lance Henriksen]] performance that was the "real killer".<ref>{{cite news | author=Katz, Paul | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,671734,00.html | title=Millennium: The Complete First Season (2004) | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date=July 30, 2004 | accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> Mark Rahner from ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' said the "''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' follow-up was uncompromisingly grim, fascinating, cinematically crafted", and that the show was "years ahead" of such "forensic mysteries" as ''[[CSI (TV series)|CSI]]''.<ref>Rahner, Mark (July 23, 2004).
