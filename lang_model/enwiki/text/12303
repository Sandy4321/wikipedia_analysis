Lambert attended [[West Virginia Wesleyan College]] in [[Buckhannon, West Virginia]]. Between 1911 and 1914, he played first base for the school's baseball team and [[Center (American football)|center]] for the football team.  [[College Football Hall of Fame|College]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Greasy Neale]] was Lambert's teammate on the West Virginia Wesleyan football and baseball teams.<ref>{{cite news|title=Georgia Wins Double-Header: Defeats the West Virginia Wesleyan Nine 10 to 9 and 7 to 0 -- Clements' Hitting Was Feature|newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution|date=April 2, 1914}}</ref><ref name=WV103>{{cite news|title=WEST VIRGINIA WESLEYAN SCORED 103 POINTS|newspaper=The Sun, Baltimore, MD|date=November 3, 1912|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1761527432.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+03,+1912&author=&pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&desc=WEST+VIRGINIA+WESLEYAN+SCORED+103+POINTS&pqatl=google}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Broaddus Loses to the Wesleyan Team|newspaper=The Gazette Times|date=October 13, 1912|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eCdRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hWYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4565,1107166&dq=lambert+wesleyan&hl=en}}(Lambert scored a touchdown on a fumble by Broaddus College)</ref><ref name=MTH>{{cite news|title=Wesleyan College Beats Marshall|newspaper=The Sun, Baltimore, Md.|date=Nov 18, 1912|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1652951072.html?FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+18,+1912&author=&pub=The+Sun+(1837-1985)&desc=Wesleyan+College+Beats+Marshall&pqatl=google}}</ref>

At the end of the 1912 season, Lambert was elected as the captain of the 1913 team.<ref>{{cite news|title=Captains Chosen By Football Teammates|newspaper=Anaconda Standard (Montana)|date=January 26, 1913}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Will Lead Eleven Against Georgetown: Capt.

==University of Michigan==
After attending college in West Virginia, Lambert attended law school at the [[University of Michigan]].  He was a member and president of Michigan's law school class of 1919.<ref>{{cite book|year=1918|title=Michiganensian|page=249|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;q1=lambert;rgn=full%20text;idno=AAG4364.1918.001;didno=AAG4364.1918.001;view=image;seq=00000257}}</ref>

Although he was touted as a candidate for Michigan's football team as early as 1914, he did not play varsity football at Michigan until 1917.  At the start of the 1917 football season, Michigan's football coach, [[Fielding H. Yost]], had only four veterans returning from the [[1916 Michigan Wolverines football team|1916 team]].  He found Lambert among the university's law students.  ''The Michigan Alumnus'' noted: "He dug up Lambert and made him report."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Final Result|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=Dec. 1917|page=191}}</ref>  Another press report noted that Lambert, who had played on the All-Freshman team in 1915, was a surprise addition to the team in mid-October: "Lambert played at West Virginia several years ago and was a member of the All-Fresh in 1915.  He did not play on the varsity this fall and has been in a uniform only a little over a week. He is light, but an accurate passer and a fighter."<ref>{{cite news|title= Michigan Eleven To Play Detroit|newspaper=Racine Journal-News|date=October 17, 1917}}</ref>  Lambert was reportedly the lightest man on the [[1917 Michigan Wolverines football team]] at 160 pounds.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Michigan Alumnus|date=November 1917|page=119|title=Prospects for Later Games}}</ref>
 
Yost did not play Lambert until the season's fourth game against the [[University of Detroit]] on October 17, 1917.  Lambert had a strong showing in his first game for Michigan.  The University of Michigan yearbook reported on his performance against Detroit: "The West Virginian managed to make about 50  percent of the tackles and would have made more but for the fact that the rest of the players got jealous and started to work."<ref>1918 Michiganensian, p. 282.</ref>  The same publication noted that Michigan's game with [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell]] (a 42&ndash;0 win) found "[[Archie Weston|Weston]] [Michigan's quarterback) and Lambert feeling like the historical million dollars."<ref>1918 Michiganensian, p. 284.</ref>  The ''Detroit Free Press'' credited Lambert with "opening inviting holes" for Michigan's backs in the Cornell game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wolverine's Run Over Cornellian Eleven, 42 to 0|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 11, 1917|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1778399702.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+11%2C+1917&author=&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&desc=Wolverine's+Run+Over+Cornellian+Eleven%2C+42+to+0&pqatl=google}}</ref>
 
Prior to the final game of the 1917 season against [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]], Lambert, [[Archie Weston]] and two other Michigan players were declared ineligible.  In Lambert's case, the ruling was due to a [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]] rule limiting players to three years of varsity sport, which Lambert had used while at West Virginia Wesleyan.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Is Given A Blow|newspaper=The Toledo News-Bee|date=November 23, 1917|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fTFYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iEUNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2251,2382982&dq=lambert+michigan&hl=en}}</ref>  The ''Michiganensian'' noted: "Several little matters, like Conference rules and studies, kept several Michiganders out of the Northwestern fray ...  It was decided that Lambert had played enough football, although he was ranking high in his studies."<ref>1918 Michiganensian, p. 284.</ref>  ''The Michigan Alumnus'' noted: "Since Weston had gained about 75 percent of the ground gained by Michigan this fall, and Lambert had secured nearly 90 percent of the tackles made by the defense, the loss of these men was a serious blow."<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=Dec. 1917|page=193|title=Northwestern 21; Michigan 12}}</ref>  On losing to Northwestern without Lambert in the lineup, Coach Yost complained that "the defense was in the law library."<ref>1918 Michiganensian, p. 284.</ref>
 
At the end of the 1917 football season, Lambert was selected as a second-team All-American by [[Walter Eckersall]] of the [[Chicago Tribune]].<ref>{{cite news|title="All" Teams Picked By Walter Eckersall|publisher=Lincoln Daily Star,|date=1917-12-16}}</ref>  Eckersall also placed Lambert on his All-Western team.<ref>1918 Michiganensian, p. 285.</ref>

While attending Michigan, Lambert was also a member of the Griffins,<ref>1918 Michiganensian, p. 365.</ref> the Archons,<ref>1918 Michiganensian, p. 368.</ref> the Barristers,<ref>{{cite book|title=Michiganensian|year=1919|page=628|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;q1=lambert;rgn=full%20text;idno=AAG4364.1919.001;didno=AAG4364.1919.001;view=image;seq=00000634}}</ref> [[Sigma Chi]],<ref>1919 Michiganensian, p. 678.</ref> [[Phi Delta Phi]],<ref>1919 Michiganensian, p. 718.</ref> and [[Michigamua]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigamua Elections|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=May 1918|page=460|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vk9YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>  He was also chosen to serve as a student member of the university's Board in Control of Athletics for the year 1918&ndash;19.<ref>{{cite news|title=Regents Meeting|newspaper=The Michigan Alumnus|date=August 1918|page=639|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vk9YAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>
