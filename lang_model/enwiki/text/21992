'''Hermann B<U+00FC>chting''' (14 March 1916 in [[Neum<U+00FC>nster]] <U+2013> 27 June 1992 in [[Rellingen]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Schnellboot]] commander in [[World War II]] and recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.

==Career==
Herman B<U+00FC>chting was born on 14 March 1916 in Neum<U+00FC>nster/Holstein. He joined the Navy in April 1935 and went through training in Stralsund. Following his training, he went aboard the new sail training ship [[Gorch Fock (1933)|''Gorch Fock'']] for two months of seamanship training. This was followed by a nine-month goodwill tour aboard the [[light cruiser]] [[German cruiser Karlsruhe|''Karlsruhe'']] which would take it from Keil, around the Cape of Good Hope to the Far East and return to Kiel by way of the Panama Canal.

B<U+00FC>chting then attended the [[Naval Academy at M<U+00FC>rwik]], [[Flensburg]], graduating from his officer training as a F<U+00E4>hnrich zur See (officer cadet) in March 1937. He continued his cadet training program by attending a series of courses, including torpedo school and intelligence school, before being sent to the Torpedo Boat Training Flottille as a Wache Offizier.

Promotions came quickly as he was elevated to Oberf<U+00E4>hnrich on 1 January 1939 and commissioned ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' in April. In October, after completing his torpedo boat training, he was ordered to the 5. Torpedobootsflottille. He was assigned to the Torpedoboot Grief, one of the first 12 new torpedo boats built for the German navy. The boat carried a 122-man crew, displaced 930 tons, and could steam at 33 knots. On 1 October 1939 B<U+00FC>chting was promoted to ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]''.

With the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, he served in the North Sea and Skagerrak on mine laying and coastal security duties. Skagerrak is a triangular area of water with Norway and Sweden to the north and Denmark to the south. (On 31 May and 1 June 1916, the British [[Grand Fleet]] and the German [[High Seas Fleet]] clashed in this area, known as the "[[Battle of Jutland]]", or "The Battle of Skagerrak" in Germany.)

Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant [[Erich Bey]] formed the first Schnellboot (E-boat) flotilla in the mid 1930s. The early Schnellbooten could reach a maximum speed of 37 knots and saw action during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1938, a second flotilla was formed at Wilhelmshaven and had a complement of 18 boats at the start of the war. 

B<U+00FC>chting  transferred to the Schnellbooten in March 1940. He was attached to the 1. Schnellbootsflotille, where he commanded several boats, including ''S-18'', ''S-21'', ''S-25'', ''S-27'' and ''S-51''. On 20 April 1940 he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class.

With the evacuation of British and French forces from Dunkirk on 26 May 1940, E-boats were immediately deployed and sank the French destroyers Orage and Sirocco. They were also responsible for sinking the British ship Wakeful and damaging another.

These boats began operating from bases in occupied France and saw action in the English Channel and the mouth of the Thames River. They were particularly successful in the Straits of Dover. B<U+00FC>chting received his next decorations, the Iron Cross 1st Class, on 3 January 1941.

In mid 1941, B<U+00FC>chting was in action off the Finnish Coast, and in early 1942 he was transferred to the Black Sea. This was followed by a promotion to ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' on 1 June 1942. 

on April 22, 1943 B<U+00FC>chting, commander of S51 of the 1.Schnellbootsflottile, was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] for his successes as an E-boat commander. On 1 September 1943 he was given command of 1.Schnellbootsflotilla, a position that he would retain until the end of the war.

The E-boats continued to give the Allies trouble along the coasts of Europe. About 250 E-boats were built, and after 1943 the bridges were armed to protect against low-flying airplanes. 

B<U+00FC>chting continued his operations in the Black Sea and was promoted to Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n on 1 June 1944. During the last several months of the war, B<U+00FC>chting and the 1. Schnellbootsflotille were back in the Baltic seeing action in the Danzig-Grotenhafen area. They were also active along the Kurland (Latvia) Coast, where they helped in defending the evacuation of large numbers of civilian refugees and military personnel, which otherwise would fall victim to Russian captivity or even death. B<U+00FC>chting would become a prisoner of war on 9 May 1945 and would remain a POW until 18 August 1945.

After the war, B<U+00FC>chting became a successful businessman and died in Rellingen, Germany on 27 June 1992.
