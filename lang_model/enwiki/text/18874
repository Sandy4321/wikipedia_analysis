'''''D<U+00E9>sert''''' is the title of a novel written by French author and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[J. M. G.

==Plot summary==
Two stories are interwoven. The shorter, which begins and ends the book, is specifically set in 1910<U+2013>1912 and tells of the last uprising of the desert tribes against the [[French protectorate of Morocco]], mostly as observed by a small boy, Nour. The longer, the story of Lalla, is set in an indefinite time, but obviously after the Second World War.  It describes her early life in a  [[Shanty town|Shanty "city"]] on the edge of an unnamed [[Morocco|Moroccan]] coastal town, and particularly her friendship with [[Haratin|"the Hartani"]] who, like her, originates from the desert tribes. It narrates the time she spends in [[Marseilles]] and her eventual return to the shanty city, where she gives birth to the Hartani's child.

;Review taken from the [[TLS]]
{{Quotation|Le Clezio received the Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise's Grand Prix Paul Morand in 1980 for ''D<U+00E9>sert'', a novel that revealed a move towards a more expansive and lyrical style. The book has a dual narrative. The first, dated 1909<U+2013>1910, chronicles the tragic fate of a Tuareg clan fleeing across Morocco from their French and Spanish colonial oppressors ("les Chretiens"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chr%C3%A9tien |title= Chr<U+00E9>tien|accessdate=1 January 2009 |work= |publisher= |date=|quote=In the French language, chr<U+00E9>tien is the masculine form of 'Christian', as both noun and adjective}}</ref>). There are fine evocations of the unforgiving desert: "They crossed the mountains for days. The burning wind blew in the ravines. The blue sky was immense above the red rocks. There was no one here, neither man nor beast, just occasionally the trace of a serpent in the sand, or, very high up in the sky, the shadow of a vulture". The second narrative follows Lalla, a beautiful, fearless, young Moroccan girl who lands in an intimidating Marseilles, where she endures abuse and hardship before being taken up by a fashion photographer. As in ''[[Poisson d'or (novel)|Poisson d'or]]'' (1997), the story of a young girl's odyssey from Morocco to Los Angeles, Le Clezio's imaginative empathy is put to good effect. |review is taken from the TLS<ref>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article709674.ece |title=A Frenchman and a geographer |accessdate=9 December 2008 |work= 5th paragraph|publisher=review is taken from the TLS |date=  April 21, 2006 | location=London | first=Adrian | last=Tahourdin}}</ref> }}

;Review taken from World Literature Today
{{Quotation|The first two sections of Le Clezio's novel, the most gripping and the ones on which we will focus, take place in Morocco's [[Sahara Desert]] <br />The events narrated, experienced in a kind of eternity, recount a myth, as previously mentioned, but not the classical type. Unlike the myths of old, Le Clezio's does not deal with inexplicable occurrences, or with fabulous beings, or with lives of divinities, heroes, heroines, or supernatural powers. Rather, it deals with [[Berber people|Berbers]] ([[Chleuh]]), a people inhabiting North Africa since, it is surmised, 3000 [[Common Era|B.C.E.]] .<br /> Although the first study devoted to the Berbers was written by the famous Arab historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332<U+2013>1406), since that time little factual knowledge has been unearthed concerning their origins.

Emphasis in Le Clezio's novel is centered on the "Blue Men" or "Blue People" ([[Taureg people|Tuareg]]s), ancient warriors of the southern desert. Impoverished and ragged in Le Clezio's tale, they are nevertheless set apart by their attire: they wear deep blue flowing robes and veils, and where the dye has rubbed off, their skin also becomes blue-tinted.

Le Clezio's characters are, as in ancient myths, endowed with a powerful religious quality, to be understood in the sense of religio (Latin, a "linking back"). That a microcosm inhabits each protagonist suggests the presence of a whole intelligible and unintelligible world which enables the individual to live not only outside of temporal time but also in an expandable space of his or her own manufacture. <br />The divine experience, be it in the form of prayer, in an animistic relationship with nature, or in the sexual act, invites the worshiper to penetrate "beyond,.... through", or "across" what others, devoid of inner sight, might consider to be impervious opacities.<br /> Le Clezio's world of transparencies in this regard follows ancient mythic patterns: the individual, gradually removed from circumscribed and limited frames of reference, is plunged into a collective experience <U+2013> a kind of [[theophany]] .|Bettina L.

;Review taken from Western Sahara information
{{Quotation|The protagonist, Lalla, appears to be not Algerian at all, as the bio claims, but from [[R<U+00ED>o de Oro]], i.e. [[Western Sahara]] (described ... as South Morocco).

The time frame, 1909<U+2013>1912, points to the failed [[Ma al-'Aynayn|Ma el-Ainin]] revolt. Sheikh Ma el-Ainin was a major figure in the history of the [[Hass<U+0101>n<U+012B>ya Arabic|Hassani]] tribal territories, who is today claimed as a nationalist forerunner by both [[Morocco]] and  [[Polisario Front|Polisario]], but who was in fact perhaps most connected to the tribal emirate in [[Adrar (region)|Adrar]] and [[Sarwari Qadiri|Qadiri sufi]] politics in today's northern [[Mauritania]]. After leading a religiously based [[Moors|Moorish]] resistance to the French commander [[Xavier Coppolani|Coppolani]]'s forces advancing northwards from [[Senegal]], he retreated into the [[Spanish Sahara]]. There, built the city of [[Smara]], out of reach of the French forces <U+2013> it is today controlled by Morocco. When fighting the French, Sheikh Ma el-Ainin claimed [[fealty]] to the Moroccan Sultan in exchange for arms and financial backing for his revolt; but when the support dried up and the Sultan distanced himself from these troublesome tribals, he turned on his former benefactor and proclaimed himself [[List of rulers of Morocco|Sultan of Morocco]] (and most of the rest of western North Africa). In 1912, his forces were routed by the French, and he died soon thereafter, but tribal [[jihad]]s against the French led by his sons went on for some time.
