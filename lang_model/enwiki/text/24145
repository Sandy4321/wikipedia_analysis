In the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]], '''[[Interstate 15]]''' is a major north-south route through the [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]], and [[San Diego County, California|San Diego]] counties and has a length of {{mi to km|287.26}} in the state. It is a major thoroughfare for traffic between [[Southern California]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. It is also the main route for traffic between [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] and the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]].

This route is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]]<ref name="cafes">[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=250-257 CA Codes (shc:250-257)]</ref> and is eligible for the [[State Scenic Highway System (California)|State Scenic Highway System]]<ref name="scenic"> [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=260-284 CA Codes (shc:260-284)]</ref>.

I-15's southern terminus is [[Interstate 8 (California)|I-8]] in San Diego. From I-8, it runs north through [[Escondido, California|Escondido]] in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], passing [[MCAS Miramar]]. The highway passes through hilly terrain and [[avocado]] farmland before entering [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]] near the rapidly-growing community of [[Temecula, California|Temecula]].  

In [[Murrieta, California|Murieta]], I-15 splits from its first (and only) spur route in California, [[Interstate 215 (California)|I-215]], which runs through the two largest cities in the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]: [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] and [[Riverside, California|Riverside]]. I-15 runs along the eastern edge of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]], passing the community of [[Lake Elsinore, California|Lake Elsinore]].  The freeway continues through the [[suburb]]an areas in the western Inland Empire, passing [[Corona, California|Corona]] and [[Ontario, California|Ontario]].  The highway is then rejoined by I-215 before it then heads northward and upward through [[Cajon Pass]], a historic pass which serves as the primary route between Southern California and the Mojave Desert region (as well as Las Vegas).

The portion of I-15 which is located between the northern and southern junctions with I-215 is also used by local residents as the major north-south route for the western portions of the San Bernardino-Riverside-Ontario metropolitan area. (I-215 serves a similar function in the eastern portion of the metropolitan area; the two are the only continuous north-south freeways in the area.)

North of the [[Cajon Pass]], I-15 traverses the [[Mojave Desert]] cities of [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] and [[Victorville, California|Victorville]].  The freeway passes through mostly unspoiled desert for {{convert|30|mi|km}} before reaching [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], the last city I-15 passes through in California.  The only other settlement I-15 passes through in its final {{convert|108|mi|km}} is [[Baker, California|Baker]], known as the "Gateway to [[Death Valley]]" and is home to the world's largest thermometer. The sign for the [[Zzyzx, California|Zzyzx]] exit, the alphabetically last place name in the United States, is a well-known landmark along the drive from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] on I-15.{{Fact|date=July 2007}} I-15 leaves California near the gambling town [[Primm, Nevada]] (formerly known as Stateline, Nevada).

===Escondido Freeway===
Heading northward, I-15 begins at [[Interstate 8 (California)|Interstate 8]] at the same place that its continuation, [[State Route 15 (California)|State Route 15]], begins its southward journey. I-15 goes through [[Mission Valley, San Diego, California|Mission Valley]] and intersects with [[State Route 52 (California)|State Route 52]] and merges with [[State Route 163 (California)|State Route 163]]. After traversing the [[MCAS Miramar]] base, I-15 emerges into [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]], where it intersects with the end of [[State Route 56 (California)|State Route 56]]. I-15 continues north into [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], where it interchanges with [[State Route 78 (California)|State Route 78]]. North of Escondido, I-15 goes through rural areas, intersecting [[State Route 76 (California)|State Route 76]] before it crosses the county line into [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]]. In Riverside County, SR 79 runs concurrently with I-15 for a four-mile (6 km) portion within the city of [[Temecula, California]] before it splits away to continue north to [[Hemet, California|Hemet]]. Then, I-15 intersects with the southern end of [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]], which carries the designation of the Escondido Freeway. Interstate 15 continues north as the Temecula Valley Freeway.<ref name="tg">{{Cite map | publisher=Thomas Brothers | title=California Road Atlas and Driver's Guide | year=2000 | page=V, 99, 106}}</ref>

On [[January 24]], [[1957]], the State Highway Commission defined the Escondido Freeway as what is now Routes 15 and 215 from Route 805 to Route 91. Note that this entire segment was previously [[U.S. Route 395 (California)|Route 395]] when it was named. Since then, the definition was extended on Route 15 south to Route 8 by Assembly Concurrent Resolution 34, Chapter 67 in 1979.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf | title=2007 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California | publisher=[[Caltrans]] | pages=60 | accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref> Meanwhile, the segment of Route 15 from the San Diego County Line to the I-15/I-215 interchange was named the Temecula Valley Freeway in 1990.<ref>Ib. at 63<!--{{cite book | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf | title=2007 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California | publisher=[[Caltrans]] | pages=63 | accessdate=2007-03-28}}--></ref>

I-15 between SR 163 and Miramar Road is known as the Semper Fi Highway in recognition of the nearby MCAS Miramar.<ref name="CaHi">{{cite web |url=http://www.cahighways.org/009-016.html#015 |title=California Highways, Routes 9 through 16 |accessdate=2007-08-30 |publisher=CaHighways.org |date=2007-08-30}}</ref>

There are [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes in the center of I-15 from [[State Route 163 (California)|State Route 163]] to [[State Route 56 (California)|State Route 56]].<ref>[http://www.sandag.org/index.asp?classid=29&fuseaction=home.classhome Interstate 15 Express Lanes]</ref> Construction is currently ongoing (as of spring 2008) to extend these lanes northward to SR 78. The current HOT lanes from SR 163 to SR 56 are being expanded to four lanes as part of the same project.

===Temecula Valley Freeway===
The '''Temecula Valley Freeway''' is a segment of [[Interstate 15 (California)|Interstate 15]] in [[Riverside County, California]], [[United States]], traveling southeast to northwest through the southern portions of the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] region.  It begins at the Riverside/[[San Diego County, California|San Diego]] county line, where the [[Corona Freeway]] ends; travels north through the cities of [[Murrieta, California|Murrieta]] (where the Escondido Freeway designation switches to [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]) and [[Temecula, California|Temecula]]; and ends at Bundy Canyon Road near [[Lake Elsinore, California|Lake Elsinore]]. Thereafter, I-15 is designated as the Corona Freeway.

===Corona Freeway===
The '''Corona Freeway''' is a [[freeway]] traveling through [[Riverside County, California]].  It is signed as [[Interstate 15 (California)|Interstate 15]] along its entire length. The Corona Freeway runs north-south from its southern terminus at I-215 near [[Temecula, California|Temecula]] to its northern terminus at the Riverside Freeway ([[California State Route 91|State Route 91]]).

The original definition for the Corona Freeway, as named by the State Highway Commission on [[July 23]] [[1958]], stated that it was "Routes 71, 91, and 15 from Route 10 West of [[Pomona, California|Pomona]] to Route 215".<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf | title=2007 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California | publisher=[[Caltrans]] | pages=69 | accessdate=2007-03-28}}</ref>

This legal definition has been amended twice: First in 1990, the California Assembly passed Concurrent Resolution 125, Chapter 78, renaming I-15 between the [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] Line (which is further south from [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]) and Bundy Canyon Road near Lake Elsinore as the Temecula Valley Freeway.<ref>Ib. at 63<!--{{cite book | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf | title=2007 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California | publisher=[[Caltrans]] | pages=63 | accessdate=2007-04-07}}--></ref>

Then in 1993, the California Assembly passed legislation officially designating [[California State Route 71|State Route 71]] as a part of the [[Chino Valley Freeway]].<ref>Ib. at 67<!--{{cite book | url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf | title=2007 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California | publisher=[[Caltrans]] | pages=67 | accessdate=2007-04-07}}--></ref> However, the name "Corona Freeway" is, confusingly, sometimes still applied to this portion of SR 71; despite the change, guide signs on I-10 eastbound and SR 57 southbound at the [[Kellogg Interchange]] in Pomona still refer to SR 71 as the "Corona Freeway".

===Ontario Freeway===
The '''Ontario Freeway''' is a segment of [[Interstate 15 (California)|Interstate 15]] in southern [[California]], running through [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]] and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] counties.  It is the principal north-south [[freeway]] through the fast-growing [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] region, in the far eastern [[suburb]]s of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

North of Limonite Avenue (south of SR 60), I-15 is known as the Ontario Freeway. I-15 intersects [[State Route 60 (California)|State Route 60]], [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]], and [[State Route 210 (California)|State Route 210]] in rapid succession as it goes through [[Norco, California|Norco]] and [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Rancho Cucamonga]]. As it nears [[Devore, California|Devore]], I-15 merges with [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]] and becomes what is known as the Barstow Freeway or the Mojave Freeway.

===Mojave Freeway===
[[Image:Cave Mountain Interstate 15.jpg|right|250px|thumb|West of Baker, the freeway jogs to pass north of [[Cave Mountain]].]]
The '''Mojave Freeway''' is the name given to the segment of [[Interstate 15 (California)|Interstate 15]] in [[California]] between the northern I-215 junction and the [[Nevada]] state line. The portion between former [[State Route 30 (California)|State Route 30]] and the Nevada state line is also known as the Barstow Freeway. It is the principal route between [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].

[[Image:Interstate15 Shadow Valley.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Westbound coming down into [[Shadow Valley]]; Halloran Summit is on the skyline, about {{convert|8|mi|km}} away.]]
The Ontario (I-15) and Escondido ([[Interstate 215 (California)|I-215]]) [[freeway]]s meet in [[Devore, California|Devore]], a foothill town just northwest of [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], merging into the Mojave Freeway.  Crossing the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] at the Cajon Pass, the freeway enters the [[Victor Valley]] and continues northeast through the [[Mojave Desert]].  It terminates at the Nevada state line; I-15 continues thereafter to Las Vegas, [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], and the cities of western [[Montana]] before ending at the U.S.-[[Canada]] border.

The Mojave Freeway is fairly busy on weekdays, as it connects the rapidly growing [[Commuter town|exurbs]] of the Victor Valley with the Los Angeles area.  On weekends and holidays, however, it can be completely [[traffic congestion|jammed]] with [[Southern California]]ns driving to Las Vegas for short vacations.

==History==
I-15 replaced [[U.S. Route 395 (California)|US 395]] between San Diego and Temecula. The highway replaced [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|US 66]] between San Bernardino and Barstow. The route north of Barstow replaced [[U.S. Route 91 (California)|US 91]].

I-15 was initially planned to run from I-10 in San Bernardino along the current I-215 alignment then up through the Cajon Pass and on to Las Vegas, with a distance of {{convert|186.24|mi|km}} within the state. California successfully argued the addition south to San Diego, suggesting that the freeway would connect the major military bases [[March Air Reserve Base|former March AFB]] and [[MCAS Miramar|former NAS (now MCAS) Miramar]]. [[U.S. Route 395 (California)|US 395]] was then signed TEMP-15 and the "old" I-15 between [[Devore, California|Devore]] and San Bernardino became I-215.

===State Route 31===
In 1933, Interstate 15 was defined as '''Legislative Route 193''', running from [[pre-1964 Legislative Route 43 (California)|pre-1964 Legislative Route 43]] (present [[State Route 91 (California)|State Route 91]]) in [[Corona, California|Corona]] to [[pre-1964 Legislative Route 9 (California)|pre-1964 Legislative Route 9]] (now [[State Route 66 (California)|State Route 66]], and was extended north to [[pre-1964 Legislative Route 31 (California)|pre-1964 Legislative Route 31]] (present I-15 and I-215) in 1935.<ref name="cah LR 193">[http://cahighways.org/193-200.html#LR193 California Highways: LRN 193]</ref> The piece south of [[U.S. Route 60 (California)|U.S. Route 60]] ([[Mission Boulevard (Southern California)|Mission Boulevard]]), running along North Main Street, Hamner Avenue and Milliken Avenue, was state-maintained by 1955, but was not assigned a signed number.<ref>[http://members.cox.net/mkpl2/hist/map-ca1955-la.jpg 1955 Gousha Los Angeles district map]</ref> This was still the only existing piece in 1963, and had a planned [[freeway]] replacement to the east.<ref>[http://cahighways.org/maps/1963routes.jpg 1963 Caltrans Los Angeles and vicinity map]</ref>

In the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]], the route was assigned as State Route 31. It was added to the [[Interstate Highway System]] in February [[1972]] as a realignment of [[Interstate 15 (California)|Interstate 15]] (the former alignment became [[Interstate 15E (California)|Interstate 15E]]).<ref name="cah interstates">[http://cahighways.org/itypes.html California Highways: Interstate Highway Types and the History of California's Interstates]</ref> Legislative changes were made in 1974, eliminating SR 31 (along with [[State Route 71 (California)|State Route 71]] south of Corona) in favor of I-15.<ref name="cah 31">[http://cahighways.org/025-032.html#031 California Highways: Former State Route 31]</ref> However, SR 31 continued to be signed - as <small>TEMPORARY</small> Interstate 15 - until present I-15 was finished. (A 1986 map shows state maintenance continuing north past SR 60 to Jurupa Street, where it turned east to I-15.<ref>[http://cahighways.org/maps/1986map.jpg 1986 Caltrans Los Angeles and vicinity map]</ref>)

==Future==
{{Future road}}
Most of Interstate 15 is undergoing major improvements from Devore to the Nevada State Line, beginning in 2002 and costing $349 million. This project will improve traffic flow on the heavily traveled highway for those going to and from Las Vegas. Most of the construction will be completed by Winter 2009. [http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist8/projects/15/I-15%20Brstw%20-STLN.revsd%206-2004%20copy.pdf] Projects include adding truck lanes on hills (39 miles at various locations), repaving {{convert|76|mi|km}} of I-15 at various locations, adding [[exit numbers]], renovating and rehabilitating the rest area between [[Baker, California|Baker]] and the Nevada State Line (Valley Wells Rest Area), reconstructing bridges in [[Baker, California|Baker]], and moving the agriculture inspection station from Yermo to the Nevada State Line and including a truck weigh station.

There is also construction ongoing (circa spring 2008) to expand traffic lanes in northern San Diego County, including the northward extension (beyond SR 56) of the existing [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes which already exist between SR 56 and SR 163. It appears that this extension will move the northern terminus of the HOT lanes to a location at or near the interchange with SR 78.

[[California State Route 15|SR 15]] shields are likely to be changed into I-15 shields on September 2008 according to Caltrans and Cal-NEXuS. {{Fact|date=July 2008}}
