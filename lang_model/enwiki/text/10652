'''Fashion in the period 1750-1795''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries reached heights of fantasy and [[Rococo|abundant ornamentation]], especially among the [[aristocracy]] of [[France]], before a long-simmering movement toward simplicity and democratization of dress under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and the [[American Revolution]] led to an entirely new mode and the triumph of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[tailor]]ing following the [[French Revolution]].

==Women's fashion==

Women's clothing styles remained confining and cumbersome for most of the period. The [[hoop skirt|hoop-skirt]]s of the 1740s were left behind, but wide [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]] (holding the skirts out at the side) came into style several times, and the aesthetic of a narrow inverted conical corseted torso above full skirts prevailed during most of the period.

In the 1780s, panniers had for the most part disappeared (with the exception of court functions), and bustle pads (bum-pads or hip-pads) were worn for a time. 

By 1790, skirts were still somewhat full, but they were no longer obviously pushed out in any particular direction (though a slight bustle might still be worn). The "pouter-pigeon" front came into style (many layers of cloth pinned over the bodice), but in other respects women's fashions were starting to be simplified by influences from Englishwomen's country outdoors wear (thus the "[[redingote]]" was the French pronunciation of an English "riding coat"), and from [[neo-classicism]]. By 1795, waistlines were somewhat raised, preparing the way for the development of the [[empire silhouette]] and unabashed neo-classicism of late 1790s fashions.

[[:Image:Mr and Mrs William Hallett.jpg|Gainsborough's 1785 portrait of Mrs Hallett]] (right) captures the exact transition between the tight bodice and elbow-length, ruffled sleeves of the mid-18th century and the natural waist and long sleeves typical of the 1790s.

===Gowns===   
   
The usual fashion of the years 1750-1780 was a low-necked [[gown]] (usually called in French a ''robe''), worn over a petticoat. If the bodice of the gown was open in front, the opening was filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], pinned to the gown over the laces or to the corset beneath.   

Tight elbow-length sleeves were trimmed with frills or ruffles, and separate under-ruffles called [[engageante]]s of lace or fine linen were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]] to the [[chemise|smock or chemise]] sleeves. The neckline was trimmed with a fabric or lace ruffle, or a neckerchief called a ''[[fichu]]'' could be tucked into the low neckline.   

The ''robe <U+00E0> la fran<U+00E7>aise'' or [[sack-back gown]] featured back pleats hanging loosely from the neckline. A fitted lining or under-bodice held the front of the gown closely to the figure.   

The ''robe <U+00E0> l'anglaise'' featured back pleats sewn in place to fit closely to the body, and then release into the skirt which would be draped in various ways.

Front-wrapping thigh-length ''shortgowns'' or [[bedgown]]s of lightweight printed cotton fabric were fashionable at-home morning wear, worn with petticoats. Over time, bedgowns became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear.<ref>Baumgarten, ''What Clothes Reveal'', p. 116-119</ref>

===Jackets and redingotes===

Toward the 1770s, an informal alternative to the gown was a costume of a jacket and petticoat, based on working class fashion but executed in finer fabrics with a tighter fit.

The ''[[Brunswick (clothing)|Brunswick]]'' gown was two-piece costume of German origin consisting of a hip-length jacket with "split sleeves" (flounced elbow-length sleeves and long, tight lower sleeves) and a hood, worn with a matching petticoat.  It was popular for traveling.

The ''caraco'' was a [[jacket]]-like bodice worn with a petticoat, with elbow-length sleeves.  By the 1790s, caracos had full-length, tight sleeves.

As in previous periods, the traditional [[riding habit]] consisted of a tailored jacket like a man's coat, worn with a high-necked shirt, a waistcoat, a petticoat, and a hat. Alternatively, the jacket and a false waistcoat-front might be a made as a single garment, and later in the period a simpler riding jacket and petticoat (without waiscoat) could be worn.

Another alternative to the traditional habit was a coat-dress called a ''joseph'' or ''riding coat'' (borrowed in French as [[redingote]]), usually of unadorned or simply trimmed woolen fabric, with full-length, tight sleeves and a broad collar with lapels or revers. The redingote was later worn as an overcoat with the light-weight chemise dress.

===Underwear===
The shift, [[chemise]] (in France), or smock had tight, short or elbow-length sleeves and a low neckline.  [[Undergarment|Drawers]] were not worn in this period.

The long-waisted, heavily boned ''stays'' of the [[1700-1750 in fashion|early 1740s]] with their narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps gave way by the 1760s to strapless stays which still were cut high at the arm pit, to encourage a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture.  The fashionable shape was to have smooth curves, a rather conical torso, with large hips.  The waist was not particularly small.  Many women's waists measure larger with stays than without.  Stays were usually laced snugly, but comfortably; only those interested in extreme fashions laced very tightly!  They offered back support, for heavy lifting, and poor and middle class women were able to work comfortably in them.  As the relaxed, country fashion took hold in France, stays were replaced by an unboned or lightly boned quilted underbodice (now called for the first time ''un corset'') for all but the most formal court occasions.

[[Pannier (clothing)|Panniers]] or side-hoops remained an essential of court fashion but disappeared everywhere else in favor of a few petticoats.

Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through ''pocket slits'' in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat. 

Woollen waistcoats were worn over the stays or corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of [[Northern Europe]] and [[United States|America]].

===Shoes===
Shoes had high, curved heels (the origin of modern "louis heels") and were made of fabric or leather. It was particularly common for shoe buckles to be worn as an "ornament" to the foot in high society, principally at balls and parties, and made an important feature of the "[[dandy]]" image. These were either polished metal, usually in silver (sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style), or with paste stones, although there were other type. These buckles were often ludicously large and one of the worlds largest collections can be seen at [[Kenwood House]].

===Hairstyles and headgear===
[[Image:Marie Antoinette with decadent hair.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Marie Antoinette]] was the most influential person in fashion at the time, especially when it came to hairstyles.]]
The 1770s fashion were notable for extreme [[hair]]styles and [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] which were built up very high, and often incorporated decorative objects (sometimes symbolic, as in the case of the famous engraving depicting a lady wearing a large ship in her hair with masts and sails &mdash; called the "Coiffure <U+00E0> l'Ind<U+00E9>pendance ou le Triomphe de la libert<U+00E9>" &mdash; to celebrate naval victory in the [[American war of independence]]). These coiffures were parodied in several famous satirical caricatures of the period.

By the 1780s, elaborate hats replaced the former elaborate hairstyles. [[Mob cap]]s and other "country" styles were worn indoors. Flat, broad-brimmed and low-crowned straw "shepherdess" hats tied on with ribbons were worn with the new rustic styles.

Hair was powdered into the early 1780s, but the new country fashion required natural colored hair, often dressed simply in a mass of curls.

==Men's fashion==
===Overview===
[[Image:Elijah boardman by earl.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Elijah Boardman wears a cutaway tailored coat over a waist-length satin waistcoat and dark breeches.  America, 1789.]]
[[Image:CWPeale .jpg|right|thumb|200px|Charles Pettit wears a matching coat, waiscoat, and breeches.  Coat and waistcoat have covered buttons; those on the coat are much larger. His shirt has a sheer frill down the front.  America, 1792.]]

Throughout the period, men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] of the [[1700-1750 in fashion|previous period]].  What changed significantly was the fabric.  Under new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits, the elaborately [[embroider]]ed silks and velvets characteristic of "full dress" or formal attire earlier in the century gradually gave way to carefully [[tailor]]ed woolen "undress" garments for all occasions except the most formal.

In [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]] in the decades around the [[American Revolution]], the adoption of plain undress styles was a conscious reaction to the excesses of European court dress; [[Benjamin Franklin]] caused a sensation by appearing at the [[France|French]] court in his own hair (rather than a wig) and the plain costume of [[Quaker]] Philadelphia.

At the other extreme was the [[Maccaroni (fashion)|"maccaroni"]].

===Coats===

The skirts of the coat narrowed from the gored styles of the previous period, and toward the 1780s began to be cutaway in a curve from the front waist.  Waistcoats extended to mid-thigh to the 1770s, and gradually shortened until they were waist-length and cut straight across.  Waistcoats could be made with or without sleeves.

As in the previous period, a loose, T-shaped silk, cotton or linen gown called a [[banyan (clothing)|banyan]] was worn at home as a sort of dressing gown over the shirt, waistcoat, and breeches.  Men of an intellectual or philosophical bent were painted wearing banyans, with their own hair or a soft cap rather than a wig.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/franklin/rush.htm|title=Franklin and Friends|accessdate=2006-03-19}}</ref> 

A coat with a wide collar called a [[frock]], derived from a traditional working-class coat, was worn for hunting and other country pursuits in both Britain and America.

===Shirt and stock===

[[Shirt]] sleeves were full, gathered at the wrist and dropped shoulder.  Full-dress shirts had ruffles of fine fabric or lace, while undress shirts ended in plain wrist bands.  A small turnover [[collar (clothing)|collar]] returned to fashion, worn with the stock.  The [[cravat]] reappeared at the end of the period.

===Breeches, shoes, and stockings===

As coats became cutaway, more attention was paid to the cut and fit of the breeches.  Breeches fitted snugly and had a fall-front opening.

Low-heeled leather [[shoe]]s fastened with [[buckle]]s, and were worn with silk or woolen [[stockings]].  [[Boots]] were worn for riding. The buckle were either polished metal, usually in silver (sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style), or with paste stones, although there were other type. These buckles were often ludicously large and one of the worlds largest collections can be seen at [[Kenwood House]].

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Wigs were worn for formal occasions, or the hair was worn long and powdered, brushed back from the forehead and ''clubbed'' (tied back at the nape of the neck) with a black ribbon.

Wide-brimmed [[hat]]s turned up on three sides called [[tricorne]]s were worn in mid-century.  Later, these hats were turned up front and back or on the sides to form [[bicorne]]s. Toward the end of the period a tall, slightly conical hat with a narrower brim became fashionable (this would evolve into the [[top hat]] in the next period).

==Children's fashion==
During most of this period, the clothes worn by middle- and upper-class children older than toddlers (especially by girls) continued to be uncomfortable-looking miniature copies of the clothes worn by adults, with the exception that girls wore back-fastening bodices and petticoats rather than open-fronted robes (see the illustration of the 1778 young French girl below).  However, towards the end of the period, there was a change to styles that were more practical for children's play &mdash; [[skeleton suit]]s with long trousers for boys, and loose ankle-length skirts for girls.

==Working class clothing==
Working-class people in 18th century England and America often wore the same garments as fashionable people<U+2014>shirts, waistcoats, coats and breeches for men, and shifts, petticoats, and gowns or jackets for women<U+2014>but they owned fewer clothes and what they did own was made of cheaper and sturdier fabrics.  Working class men also wore short jackets, and some (especially sailors) wore trousers rather than breeches.  [[Smock-frock]]s were a regional style for men, especially shepherds.  Country women wore short hooded cloaks, most often red.  Both sexes wore handkerchiefs or neckerchiefs.<ref name="Styles">Styles, ''The Dress of the People'', p. 32-36</ref><ref name="Reveal">Baumgarten, ''What Clothes Reveal'', p. 106-127</ref>

Men's felt hats were worn with the brims flat rather than cocked or turned up.  Men and women wore shoes with shoe buckles (when they could afford them). Men who worked with horses wore boots.<ref name="Styles" />
