'''''Ten Ton Pressure''''' is an EP by the [[industrial rock]] band [[Chemlab]] released in 1990.

The duo of [[Dylan Thomas Moore]] and Joe Frank on synthesizers later teamed up with Jared Hendrickson (now known as [[Jared Louche]]) to create this EP. It was financed by [[Zalman Fishman]], a nightclub owner who founded the now defunct [[Fifth Colvmn Records]]. Zalman became involved when he was introduced to Joe Frank through a mutual friend. It was recorded illegally at [[National Geographic]]'s studios after hours and mixed in Los Angeles by [[Hilary Bercovici]], a friend of Frank's. 

Dylan and Jared moved to New York City where they continued [[Chemlab]] without Frank until the band's implosion in 1997. The EP showcased Moore's burgeoning talents, his aggressive, experimental programming and Jared Hendrickson's apocalyptic vision of the world. It was noisy yet hooky, the sound a mixture of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Front 242]], [[Skinny Puppy]] and such first-wave [[Industrial music|industrial]] bands as [[SPK (band)|SPK]] and [[Throbbing Gristle]] yet distinctly their own. It instantly struck a chord in the nascent American machine rock/industrial music scene and became an instant underground hit on dance floors across the country. Hendrickson's aggressive promotion ensured that the EP was reviewed in most of the music magazines and trade journals of the day and the first 1000 vinyl copies sold out very quickly. On the strength of excellent reviews and a strong buzz the band was asked to support [[Nine Inch Nails]] on their "Now I'm Nothing" tour in the winter of 1991. Moore wrote two songs specifically for that tour, 'Gas Mask' and 'X-Flipped' and although they performed them every night and they very much showed the harder and even more experimental direction the band would take on their subsequent albums, neither song was ever recorded. The tour was a smash success of sold-out shows that solidly planted Chemlab before the exploding underground scene and Ten Ton Pressure went into numerous reprints though never again on vinyl.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
