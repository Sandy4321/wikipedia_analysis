The Pine Bush has been a historical, cultural, and environmental asset to the [[Capital District]] and [[Hudson Valley]] regions of New York. This pine barrens was passed through by pioneers moving west and was the site of the first passenger railroad in the United States.<ref name=Stockade/> The Pine Bush is also home to the [[Karner Blue]] butterfly, an endangered species first identified by [[Vladimir Nabokov]] in 1944 when visiting the Albany Pine Bush. The common name of the butterfly commemorates a hamlet in the Pine Bush, [[Karner, New York|Karner]] in the town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] where Nabokov's [[type specimen]] for identifying the species was collected.<ref>{{cite book|title = Whispers in the Pines: a Naturalist in the Northeast|pages = 58<U+2013>9|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=fZgFzfOo_xAC&pg=PT73&dq=karner+ny+albany&lr=&cd=11#v=onepage&q=karner%20ny%20albany&f=false|author = Burger, Joanna|ISBN = 978-0-8135-3794-8|year = 2006|publisher = Rutgers University Press}}</ref>

==History==
===European colonization===
Around 10,000 years ago [[Indigenous peoples of America|Native Americans]] moved into the Pine Bush area and when [[European peoples|Europeans]] arrived in the early 17th century, two groups lived in the immediate area: the [[Mohawk nation]] of the [[Iroquois]] to the west, and the [[Mahican]]s to the east, along the Hudson River.<ref name=Culture/> The [[United Netherlands|Dutch]] from their trading outpost of [[Fort Orange]], which was established in 1624, traded with both native groups. For the natives the Pine Bush was an important source of firewood and animal [[Fur|pelts]] to trade with the Dutch, but by 1640 the natives were having trouble finding enough animals in the Pine Bush to supply the growing European demand.<ref name=Culture/> Schenectady was a name given by the Iroquois to the settlement at Fort Orange, meaning "beyond the pine plains" referring to the Pine Bush; and the Dutch granted a patent under the name of ''Schenectady'' to a settlement opposite the Pine Bush from Fort Orange in 1661.<ref>{{cite web|title = Schenectady|publisher = New York State Museum|author = Colonial Albany Social History Project|accessdate = 2010-07-18|date = 2010-06-01|url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/na/schenectady.html}}</ref> To the settlers at Fort Orange, the settlement on the Mohawk River started by [[Arent van Curler]] was "beyond the pine plains", and therefore the name Schenectady (in various spelling connotations) became associated with the village at that site.<ref>{{cite book|title = A History of the Schenectady Patent in the Dutch and English Times|publisher = J.

[[File:Kings Highway Albany Crop.png|thumb|Map of the King's Highway from Albany (lower right) through the Pine Bush to Schenectady (upper left) in 1767.]]
The ''King's Highway'' originated during Dutch times as a series of foot paths the natives took through the Pine Bush to trade with Fort Orange, but after the founding of Schenectady it referred to a major route between the two settlements. Until the mid-18th century, the King's Highway was no more developed than those foot paths.<ref name=Highway>{{cite web|title = King's Highway|publisher = New York State Museum|author = Colonial Albany Social History Project|accessdate = 2010-07-18|date = 2010-06-01|url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/loc/kingshighway.html}}</ref> During the [[French and Indian Wars]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] military improved the road significantly, and after the war it was used by a large number of settlers moving west.<ref name=Highway/> Also during the war from 1699 to 1707 Albany residents collected firewood from the Pine Bush for the large army that was camped at [[Fort Frederick (Albany)|Fort Frederick]].<ref name=Culture/> In 1710, [[German people|Germans]] [[immigrated]] from [[Palatine]] to the Albany area to live and work in the Pine Bush in order to harvest pines for [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] and rosin for the construction of naval vessels.<ref name=Culture/> These immigrants would later go on to discover and name the [[Helderberg Escarpment]] and settle [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Close Thacher Park? Don<U+2019>t Even Think About It!|author = Rittner, Don|publisher = Hearst Newspapers|work = Times Union (Albany)|url = http://blog.timesunion.com/rittner/close-thacher-park-dont-even-think-about-it/619/|accessdate = 2010-07-18|date = 2010-02-22}}</ref>

During the late-18th century, taverns and the occasional homesteader began to dot the Pine Bush along the King's Highway while development began to encroach on the Pine Bush at the Albany and Schenectady edges as those settlements began to grow out towards each other.<ref name=Highway/> The highway and the Pine Bush was a frontier wilderness and extremely dangerous, so starting in 1765 militiamen began taking turns escorting travelers through to protect them from outlaws, bandits, smugglers, and other dangers. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] it was home to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] of the British Crown.<ref name=Culture/> One of the taverns established in the 1760s catering to Pine Bush travelers on the King's Highway was the ''Truax Tavern'' owned by Isaac Truax, who was a Tory sympathizer during the Revolution, but in his own words "not a Tory, but a man for the King". Rumors circulated of several murders/robberies being carried out at the tavern.<ref name=Culture/><ref>{{cite web|title = Isaac Jacob Truax|url = http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~truax/isaac.html|publisher = ancestry.com|date = 2006-08-04|accessdate = 2010-07-19}}</ref> Travel became a bit safer in 1793 when a [[stage coach]] began taking passengers through the Pine Bush for three cents per mile.<ref name=Culture/>  [[Herman Melville]], a native of Albany and nearby [[Troy, New York|Troy]], described the desolation and beauty of traveling by stage coach through the Pine Bush in his 1851 novel, ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701.txt |title=Moby Dick |author=[[Herman Melville]] |publisher=Gutenberg.Org}}</ref>

===19th century===
The 19th century saw great improvements in modes of transportation for traveling through the Pine Bush with better roads and soon thereafter [[railroad]]s. Beginning in 1799 the [[Great Western Turnpike]] (today's [[US Route 20]]) and the Albany-Schenectady Turnpike ([[New York Route 5]]) were built through the Pine Bush. The Western Turnpike connected Albany west across the state to the [[US Midwest]], while the Albany-Schenectady Turnpike replaced the King's Highway to Schenectady.<ref name=Culture/> In 1826, in order to reduce travel time between Schenectady and Albany along the [[Erie Canal]], the [[Mohawk and Hudson Railroad]] was chartered; it was the first railroad in the state of New York, and the fourth in the United States. On July 2, 1830, the [[DeWitt Clinton (locomotive)|DeWitt Clinton]] became the first passenger train in the United States, traveling over the {{convert|16|mi|km|adj=on}} route through the heart of the Pine Bush.<ref name=Stockade>{{cite web|title = Stockade History|url = http://www.historicstockade.com/Historyhome.htm|publisher = The Stockade Association of Schenectady, New York, Inc.|accessdate = 2010-07-19|url = http://www.historicstockade.com/Historyhome.htm}}</ref> 

Over time, the turnpikes and railroad opened up parts of the Pine Bush to settlement, farming, and even [[land speculation]]. One of the earliest residents was Theophillus Roessle, who owned a large farm and manor in what is now the hamlet of [[Roessleville, New York|Roessleville]], just outside of Albany in the town of Colonie. He claimed that the sandy soil of the Pine Bush was "the best land for fruits in the world."<ref name=Culture/> Further west part of the Pine Bush was carved up in 1858 into 860 plots as part of what is now known as the "Great Land Swindle" and sold to buyers outside the region. When they came to inspect their land, they felt it to be useless barrens devoid of any good use; they would then try to recoup their money by selling the land to other unsuspecting outsiders.<ref name=Culture/>

Pressures through direct settlement and roads for passersby were not the only disturbance the Pine Bush felt during the 19th century. As in the colonial period, the Pine Bush continued to be tapped for its natural resources; whereas in earlier centuries its primary resources were firewood and wildlife, it was now water.<ref name=Culture/> The [[Patroon Creek]], roughly where three feeder streams joined in the heart of the Pine Bush along Albany's northern border, was dammed in 1850 to form [[Rensselaer Lake]].<ref name=Culture/><ref name=1914Preserve>{{cite web|author = Wolcott, John|title = The 1914 Pine Bush Preserve: What became of it?|url = http://savethepinebush.org/News/MarApr00/1914.html|publisher = Save the Pine Bush|date = 2000-03-09|accessdate = 2010-07-19}}</ref>

In 1871, the northwestern portion of Albany, west from Magazine Street, consisting of mostly undeveloped Pine Bush, was annexed to the neighboring town of Guilderland<ref name=early>{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=bi+centenial+history+of+albany&cd=1#v=onepage&q=guilderland&f=false|page = 77|title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany: History of the County of Albany from 1609-1886; Volume 1|author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney|publisher = W.W.

===20th century===
The Reverend Louis W. Parson and his wife migrated in 1927 from [[Mississippi]] to Albany, where he founded the First Church of God in Christ. In four trips to Mississippi, Parson encouraged friends and family to move to Albany and join the church and many did during the 1930s and 1940s. The reverend felt that the [[mores]] of Albany's [[Neighborhoods of Albany, New York#South End|South End]], where they originally settled, was not conducive to religious life and therefore he started a community in the Pine Bush along Rapp Road. Two {{convert|14|acres|ha|adj=on}} undeveloped properties were purchased by Reverend Parson in 1930 and 1933 and the community grew by "haphazard" splitting of the properties, a narrow land.<ref name="nrhptext">{{cite web|last=Lemak |first=Jennifer A. |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Rapp Road Community Historic District |url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=11086 |date=April, 2000|accessdate=2009-04-19}}[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=11084 ''Accompanying 18 photos, undated'']</ref>

In 1912, the city of Albany commissioned a study by notable architect [[Arnold W. Brunner]] and landscape architect [[Charles Downing Lay]] regarding beautification of the city, and this report was later published under the name ''Stvdies for Albany''.<ref name=1914Preserve/> In this study, Brunner and Lay proposed using the Rensselaer Lake waterworks property as the core of a new {{convert|1000|acres|ha|adj=on}} natural park, preferably with little done to improve it &mdash; "In fact the less done to it the better."<ref>{{cite book|title = Stvdies for Albany|author = Brunner, Arnold  and Charles Lay|pages = 30<U+2013>31|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=jX8AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA65&dq=clinton+square+albany|publisher = Arnold W. Brunner|year = 1914}}</ref> Instead of adding land to create a park, portions of the original waterworks property were sold off piecemeal and developed over the following century.<ref name=1914Preserve/> In the 1950s, the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90]]) was built through the Pine Bush, and in 1955 a portion of the waterworks east of Fuller Road was sold to a brush manufacturer, which dissolved a section of the old [[Mohawk and Hudson Railroad]] embankment. This natural and historical destruction led to a renewed push for protection of the Pine Bush, though this too would be ignored, as was the Brunner and Lay proposal.<ref name=1914Preserve/> Further development would be seen in the 1950s and 60s with the construction of the [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus]] and the [[University at Albany, SUNY|SUNY Albany uptown campus]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Phase I Archaeological Survey Harriman State Office Campus|author = The Louis Berger Group, Inc.|accessdate = 2010-07-06|date = September 2008|publisher = The Chazen Companies|url = http://www.nylovesbiz.com/Subsidiaries_Projects/HRTDC/Data/HarrimanArcheologicalAssesment.pdf}}</ref> 

Mayor [[Erastus Corning 2nd]] in the 1960s pushed forward the Washington Avenue Extension, a four-lane divided highway extending Washington Avenue westward from Fuller Road through the Pine Bush to New Karner Road ([[NY Route 155]]). This opened the heart of the Pine Bush and the western section of the city to development and was called "a knife through the heart of the Pine Bush".<ref name=Corning/> Soon afterward, Neil Hellman, a [[Horse racing|race horse]] magnate and major developer in the city, proposed a huge "city within a city" on {{convert|390|acres|ha}} that would have apartments, stores, an office park, one or two schools, and fire and police stations. Mayor Corning estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 individuals would live there. Environmentalists and neighborhood groups fought and ultimately defeated this proposal.<ref name=Corning>{{Cite book |last=Grondahl |first=Paul |title=Mayor Erastus Corning: Albany Icon, Albany Enigma |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=2007 |location=Albany |isbn=9780791472941}}</ref>

The history of the Pine Bush received notoriety when Mayor Corning gave [[Don Rittner]] a $500 donation in 1972 to excavate the Truax Tavern along the King's Highway.<ref name=Corning/> Rittner disproved the prevailing historical beliefs concerning the sophistication and structure of the tavern, and possibly confirmed rumors about murder at the tavern with the discovery of several skeletons under the tavern's floor.<ref name=Culture/><ref name=Corning/> This discovery led to Rittner becoming Albany's first municipal archaeologist and possibly the first in the nation.<ref name=Corning/>

While Mayor Corning was responsible for the largest purchases of Pine Bush land as a preserve, he was also responsible for placing the Albany landfill in the Pine Bush, the construction of the Washington Avenue Extension, and authorizing much of the development that occurred during his 42 years in office as mayor.<ref name=Corning/> In 1967, a portion of Albany's waterworks/Pine Bush property in the town of Colonie along Central Avenue was sold to developers who built an [[enclosed mall]], the [[Northway Mall (Colonie, NY)|Northway Mall]]. Two years later the city moved its dump to the Pine Bush,<ref name=1914Preserve/> and the [[Neighborhoods of Albany, New York#Dunes|Dunes]], a single family housing development in the middle of the Pine Bush off the Washington Avenue Extension, was built in the mid-1970s.<ref>{{cite newspaper|publisher = Hearst Newspapers|work = Times Union (Albany)|url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=9285863|title = Neighborhoods: The Dunes, Albany|author = Lisi, Michael|date = 2010-01-17|accessdate = 2010-07-19|page = G3}}</ref> In response to these developments of sensitive Pine Bush lands, concerned citizens formed [[Save the Pine Bush]] in 1978. The organization filed lawsuits for the next several decades to stop further developments.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://savethepinebush.org/MoreArt/summary.html|title = Save the Pine Bush Brief History and Summary|author = Jackson, Lynne|publisher = Save the Pine Bush|accessdate = 2010-07-19|date = 1996-07-04}}</ref>

Among those developments Save the Pine Bush fought was the construction of [[Crossgates Mall]] in the town of Guilderland. First proposed in 1978, it was finished in 1984, then expanded to double the original size in 1994 to become the third largest mall in New York at 1.5 million square feet.<ref>{{cite newspaper|publisher = Hearst Newspapers|work = Times Union (Albany)|author = Woodruff, Cathy|page = E1|date = 2009-03-22|accessdate = 2010-07-19|url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=7661508|title = Loved, Hated and Thriving}}</ref> Plans in the late 1990s to increase the size of the Crossgates Mall with over 2 million additional square feet of retail space on two new stories, a 12-story hotel, and activities such as bowling, ice skating, miniature golf and soccer, were dropped in 1999 against widespread opposition.<ref>{{cite newspaper|work = Times Union (Albany)|publisher = Hearst Newspapers|title = Game Never Ends for Rival Malls|url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=6400892|author = Kennedy, Marlene|page = E1|date = 2006-05-26}}</ref>

In 1985, a bill to establish a state controlled preserve to protect Pine Bush lands never made it out of committee. The bill was proposed the following year by [[New York Assembly|Assemblyman]] Robert Connor ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])-[[New City, New York|New City]]. Among the local politicians who opposed the bill was Albany [[Mayors of Albany, New York|Mayor]] [[Thomas Whalen III]], who sparred with Assemblyman Connors in a series of letters in which Connors stated, "if the mayor allows the final destruction of the Pine Bush, the city of Albany will be an ancient archaeological ruin before the pine barren is replaced." Assemblyman Arnold Proskin ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]])-Colonie, whose district included portions of the proposed preserve, opposed on the grounds that the bill was creating another state agency like the [[Adirondack Park Agency]] that would wrest control from local communities over their own development.<ref>{{cite newspaper|title = Pine Barrens Struggle Continues|author = Roth, Bennett|page = B5|date = 1986-07-13|url = http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=5476947|accessdate = 2010-07-19|publisher = Hearst Newspapers|work = Times Union (Albany)}}</ref>

The Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission was finally created in 1988 and consists of the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]], the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]], [[The Nature Conservancy]], the towns of Colonie and Guilderland, the city of Albany, Albany County, and four private citizens appointed by the governor.<ref name=Info/> In 2001, the State Employees Federal Credit Union (SEFCU) bank branch on New Karner Road was taken by the state for the Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center.<ref name=Discover/>  

The Albany landfill has been in the Pine Bush since 1969 and has had numerous expansions, the latest of which occurred in 2010. {{As of|2010}}, the landfill is expected to have seven years of operating life remaining with the latest expansion of {{convert|15|acre|ha}}.

==Geography==
The Pine Bush is within the Hudson Valley section of the [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]] in the state of New York, and occupies parts of the city of Albany and the towns of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] and [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]] within Albany County. The Pine Bush includes not only pine barrens, but also grasslands of prairie grasses, northern and southern [[Ecological succession|successional forests]], and numerous ravines with some [[wetlands]]. The Pine Bush ranges in elevation from {{convert|260|ft|m}} to {{convert|360|ft|m}} above [[sea level]].<ref name=Habitat/>

==Geology==

Underlying the Albany Pine Bush is a [[bedrock]] consisting of [[shale]] and [[siltstone]], laid down 450 million years ago during the [[Middle Ordovician]]. The bedrock is covered by [[glaciolacustrine deposits]] which make up the sandy [[topsoil]]s of the barrens.<ref name=Habitat/>

As the [[glacier]]s of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] began to recede from the [[Hudson Valley]] area, a [[glacial lake]] known today as [[Lake Albany]] extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large [[delta (river)|delta]] formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the [[Mohawk River]] flowed into the lake.<ref name=Habitat/><ref name=Culture>{{cite web|title = Natural Cultural History|publisher = Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission|accessdate = 2010-07-17|year = 2005|url = http://www.albanypinebush.org/preserve_information/natural_cultural_history/natural_cultural_history.htm}}</ref> Along the shoreline of the lake, [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]] sands were deposited between the present-day cities of [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]] and [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]]; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain.<ref name=Habitat/> Relieved from the weight of the glacier, the land began to [[Post-glacial rebound|rebound]], and the lake receded by draining into the [[Hudson River]], the deposits of sand in the delta area were then [[Aeolian processes|sculpted by wind]] into sand [[dune]]s. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes.<ref name=Habitat/><ref name=Culture/> The Pine Bush originally occupied {{convert|40|sqmi|km2}}, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in [[North America]].&nbsp;<ref name=Habitat/>

==Ecology==
===Flora===
[[File:Albany Pine Bush.jpg|thumb|A view of the pine and scrub oak in western Albany]]
Less than half of the protected areas of the Albany Pine Bush (42%, or {{convert|952|acres|ha}}) are currently pitch pine-scrub oak barrens, with an additional {{convert|680|acres|ha}} of disturbed areas with invasive plant growth that are now under protection and can be restored to their pristine barren status. The remaining pine barrens are dominated by [[pitch pine]] (''Pinus rigida''), a tall shrub layer consisting of [[bear oak]] and [[dwarf chestnut oak]] (''Quercus ilicifolia'' and ''Q. prinoides''), and a low shrub layer composed of [[lowbush blueberries]] (''Vaccinium angustifolium'' and ''V. pallidum''), [[black huckleberry]] (''Gaylussacia baccata''), and [[sweet fern]] (''Comptonia peregrina''). Between areas of pitch pine-scrub oak barrens are small patches of grassland dominated by prairie grasses including [[big bluestem]] (''Andropogon gerardii''), [[little bluestem]] (''Schizachyrium scoparium''), [[Indiangrass]] (''Sorghastrum nutans''), as well as small trees like the shrubby [[willows]] (''Salix humilis'' and ''S. tristis''). Characteristic [[forbs|flowering plants]] include [[bush clover]] (''Lespedeza capitata'' and ''L. hirta''), [[goat's-rue]] (''Tephrosia virginiana''), and wild [[lupin]]e (''Lupinus perennis'').<ref name=Habitat/>

Due to prolonged periods of [[Wildfire suppression|natural fire suppression]], much of the Pine Bush has evolved into northern or southern hardwood forests. These forests, often dominated by invasive species that are foreign to the area, occupy roughly {{convert|500|acres|ha}} of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve. The southern hardwood forests are dominated by [[black locust]] (''Robinia pseudoacacia''), and [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), all of which are exotic;  with lesser numbers of native [[oak]]s (''Quercus'') and [[maple]]s (''Acer''), and [[tree of heaven]] (''Ailanthus altissima''). The shrub layer is dominated by [[Rubus occidentalis|black raspberry]] (''Rubus occidentalis'') and other [[bramble]]s. In contrast the northern hardwood forests are dominated by [[Aspen]] (''Populus''), black cherry, [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] (''Pinus strobus''), [[gray birch]] (''Betula populifolia''), [[green ash]] (''Fraxinus pennsylvanica''), and oaks.<ref name=Habitat/>

Ravines within the Pine Bush contain mixed forests of pine-northern hardwoods and Appalachian oak-pine. The pine-hardwood forests are dominated by hardwood species such as white pine and [[yellow birch]] (''Betula alleghaniensis''), mixed with scattered red maple, a shrub layer dominated by [[witch-hazel]] (''Hamamelis virginiana''), and a herbaceous layer composed of a variety of herbs, [[moss]]es, and [[lichens]]. The Appalachian oak-pine forest has a tree canopy of one or more oak species, primarily [[Quercus velutina|black oak]], [[white oak]], and [[chestnut oak]] (''Quercus velutina'', ''Q. alba'', and ''Q prinus''); these are mixed with pitch pine and some white pine, and a shrub layer dominated by [[Heath (habitat)|heath]] shrubs, typically blueberries and black huckleberry. Marshes and wetlands occur along the northern boundary of the Pine Bush and along the bottoms of ravines. Roughly {{convert|35|acres|ha}} of [[vernal pools]] have been mapped, these are ground-water fed ponds that are dominated by grasses, sedges, herbs, and low shrubs.<ref name=Habitat/>

The Pine Bush is home to [[poa|bog bluegrass]] (''Poa paludigena''), a Federal [[Species of Concern]], as well as the rare [[Cyperus erythrorhizos|red-rooted flatsedge]] (''Cyperus erythrorhizos''), Houghton's [[umbrella-sedge]] (''Cyperus houghtonii''), and Schweinitz's flatsedge (''Cyperus schweinitzii''). Bog bluegrass occurs at the bottom of a ravine in the Pine Bush and is the only place in the [[New York Bight]] watershed where this plant appears. Bayard's [[malaxis]] (''Malaxis bayardii'') is a rare [[orchid]] that occurs in the Pine Bush as well.<ref name=Habitat/>

===Fauna===

The Albany Pine Bush is home to hundreds of species of [[Lepidoptera]] (moths), including over 40 [[Noctuidae]] considered to be pine barrens specialists, but the most well-known species in the is the [[Karner Blue]] (''Lycaeides melissa samuelis''), a butterfly on the [[Endangered Species List]]. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in only a handful of sites, attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and [[host plant]] for its [[larvae]]- the [[Lupin|wild blue lupine]], which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally-rare butterflies include the [[dusted skipper]] (''Atrytonopsis hianna''), [[Henry's Elfin]] (''Incisalia henrici''), [[Frosted Elfin]] (''Incisalia irus''), and [[Edward's Hairstreak]] (''Satyrium edwardsii''). The inland barrens [[buck moth]] (''Hemileuca maia'') is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (''Catopyrrha coloraria''), several [[Noctuidae|noctuid moths]] (''[[Apharetra]] purpurea, [[Chaetaglaea]] cerata, [[Chytonix]] sensilis, [[Macrochilo bivittata]]'', and ''[[Zanclognatha martha]]''), bird dropping moth (''Cerma cora''), and a [[Geometer moth|geometrid moth]] (''Itame''). The Albarufan [[dagger moth]] was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.<ref name=Habitat/>  

The Pine Bush is also home to 30 of the 44 species of [[amphibians]] and [[reptiles]] that are indigenous to Albany County, and seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York.<ref>{{cite magazine|author = Stewart, Margaret M. and John Rossi|title = The Albany Pine Bush: A Northern Outpost for Southern Species of Amphibians and Reptiles in New York|journal = American Midland Naturalist|publisher = University of Notre Dame|volume = 106|page = 202|issue = 2|year = 1981|month = October|url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/2425164}}</ref> Three species of [[salamander]], the [[Jefferson salamander]] (''Ambystoma jeffersonium''), [[blue-spotted salamander]] (''Ambystoma laterale''), and [[spotted salamander]] (''Ambystoma maculatum''), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the [[spotted turtle]] (''Clemmys guttata'') and [[wood turtle]] (''Clemmys insculpta''), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area; and about 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.<ref name=Habitat/>
