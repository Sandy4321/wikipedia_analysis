'''Norman Walter Dransfield Yardley''' (19 March 1915&nbsp;<U+2013> 3 October 1989) was an [[England cricket team|English]] [[cricket]]er who played for [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] and [[England cricket team|England]], as a right-handed batsman and occasional bowler. An [[History of English amateur cricket#Amateurism in cricket|amateur]], he captained Yorkshire from 1948 to 1955 and England on fourteen occasions between 1947 and 1950, winning four [[Test cricket|Tests]], losing seven and drawing three.  Yardley was named [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]] in 1948 and in his obituary in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', he was described as Yorkshire's finest amateur since [[Stanley Jackson]].

Yardley played schoolboy cricket at [[St Peter's, York]]. A highly talented all-round sportsman, he went to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], and won [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] at cricket, [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[rugby fives]] and [[field hockey]]. In the [[The University Match (cricket)|university matches]], he scored 90 in his second year, 101 in his third and was captain for his final year. He made his Yorkshire debut in 1936 and played for the county  until 1955, when he retired as a player. He made his Test match debut against South Africa in 1939 and after the [[World War II|Second World War]] was chosen as vice-captain to [[Wally Hammond]] on the [[MCC tour of Australia in 1946<U+2013>47|1946<U+2014>47 tour of Australia]] where he captained England in the [[1946-47 Ashes series#Fifth Test&nbsp;<U+2013> Sydney|fifth Test]]. He followed Hammond as skipper in 1947, and captained England intermittently until 1950 when his business commitments allowed. In 1948 he succeeded to the Yorkshire leadership when [[Brian Sellers]] resigned. Yardley remained in the position until 1955, during a time when Yorkshire had several difficult players in their dressing room. Under Yardley, Yorkshire were joint champions in 1949 but too often for the liking of supporters, finished second to [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] in the [[County Championship]]. He served as a Test match [[Selector (sport)|selector]] between 1951 and 1954, acting as chairman of selectors in 1952. He was President of Yorkshire C.C.C. from 1981 to 1984, when he resigned after becoming involved in controversy over the decision to release [[Geoffrey Boycott]] in 1983. He died after a stroke in 1989.

==Early life==
Yardley was born in [[Royston, South Yorkshire|Royston]], near [[Barnsley]], on 19 March 1915 to a family with no real background in [[cricket]].<ref name=cricinfo/><ref name=coy>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154631.html| title = Norman Yardley (Cricketer of the Year)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate =12 June 2010}}</ref> He was sent to [[St Peter's School, York|St Peter's, York]], where he made a good impression as a cricketer, being in the school team for five years from 1930. In his final two years, he captained the team in succession to [[Brian Sellers]].<ref name=coy/><ref name=H148>Hodgson, p. 148.</ref> In 1933, his first season in charge, he scored 973 runs at an [[Batting average#Cricket|average]] of 88.45, scoring three centuries in consecutive innings. He headed the [[bowling average]]s, with 40 wickets at 11.90 runs per wicket.<ref name=coy/> His form that season saw him selected for the match between Young Amateurs and Young Professionals at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]], in which Yardley scored 189 in his first representative match, playing against his future England team-mate [[Denis Compton]].<ref name=coy/> In 1934, Yardley played in two further representative matches at Lord's, for The Rest against Lord's Schools,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/245/245759.html| title = Lord's Schools v The Rest in 1934| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =12 June 2010}}</ref> and for Public Schools against The Army, making 117, the first century in the fixture for Public Schools, and 63. ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' later cited these successes as a demonstration of his ability to perform well on important occasions.<ref name=coy/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/136/136060.html| title = Army v Public Schools in 1934| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =12 June 2010}}</ref> While still at school, he came to the attention of [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]], playing for the Yorkshire Colts side and receiving coaching from [[George Hirst]].<ref name=coy/> He played for Yorkshire Second XI once in 1932, twice in 1933 and twice in 1934.<ref name=figures/>

==First-class cricketer==
===University Cricketer===
Leaving St Peter's School, Yardley went to [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[Cambridge University]], where he immediately began to show all-round ability at sports. He won the North of England [[Squash (sport)|Squash Championships]] every year between 1934 and 1939, and won his [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] in [[hockey]], squash, and [[Rugby Fives]]. However, his main distinction came from cricket, where he was a Blue in each his four years at Cambridge.<ref name=H148/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/720/720.html| title = Norman Yardley (CricketArchive profile)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =19 June 2010}}</ref> He played for [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|the University team]] in his first year, the 1935 season, making ten first-class appearances without much success. His ''Wisden'' obituary noted that "class rather than performance guaranteed his place."<ref name=obit>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155344.html| title = Norman Yardley (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1990| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate =12 June 2010}}</ref> He made his first-class debut against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]], scoring a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] in his first innings and 24 runs in the second.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15314.html| title = Cambridge University v Sussex in 1935| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 June 2010}}</ref> He passed fifty on just one occasion that season, scoring 319 runs at an average of 16.78,<ref name=fcbatting>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/720/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Norman Yardley| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 June 2010}}</ref> and bowled 69 balls without taking a wicket.<ref name=fcbowling>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/720/f_Bowling_by_Season.html| title = First-class Bowling in Each Season by Norman Yardley| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 June 2010}}</ref> Nevertheless, he played in the [[The University Match (cricket)|University Match]], scoring just 19 and 36.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15484.html| title = Oxford University v Cambridge University in 1935| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 June 2010}}</ref>

In the following season, Yardley improved considerably, becoming a dominant force in University Cricket according to ''Wisden''.<ref name=coy/> His maiden first-class [[Century (cricket)|century]] came in a narrow Cambridge victory over the Army,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15766.html| title = Cambridge University v Army in 1936| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =19 June 2010}}</ref> and he scored a second against Surrey, remaining [[not out]] for 116 in a total of 359.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15855.html| title = Surrey v Cambridge University in 1936| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =19 June 2010}}</ref> Bowling much more regularly,<ref name=fcbowling/> his maiden wickets in first-class cricket came in a performance of four wickets for 45 against Yorkshire, including the wicket of [[Len Hutton]].<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15777.html| title = Cambridge University v Yorkshire in 1936| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =19 June 2010}}</ref> Yardley topped the Cambridge batting averages and played an effective innings of 90 in the University Match. This display impressed [[Stanley Jackson]], an influential former Yorkshire amateur cricketer, and he urged the Yorkshire selectors to include Yardley in the first team.<ref name=coy/> Yardley was still appearing in the county second team at this stage,<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/720/Minor_Counties_Championship_Matches.html| title = Minor Counties Championship matches played by Norman Yardley| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 June 2010}}</ref> but at the end of August, he made his debut for the Yorkshire first eleven, appearing in the County Championship match against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]. He scored 12 in his only innings and took a wicket.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15924.html| title = Yorkshire v Derbyshire in 1936| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 June 2010}}</ref> He played in a further seven matches for Yorkshire, scoring 309 runs in ten innings with a highest score of 89 against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]], with further fifties against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC).<ref name=coy/><ref name=figures>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=720&opponentmatch=exact&playername=&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason=| title = Player Oracle NWD Yardley| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =19 June 2010}}</ref> In all first-class cricket that season, Yardley scored 1,017 runs at an average of 37.66 and took 12 wickets at an average of 26.08.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

No official Tests were played on the tour, but Yardley played in the representative matches which took place,<ref name=coy/><ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> scoring 96 in the first game, but his highest score in four other innings was 31.<ref name=figures/>

Honours continued to come Yardley's way in the [[1938 English cricket season|1938 season]]. He was chosen to captain Cambridge in his final season in the team; although his side did not win a match,<ref name=coy/> Yardley enjoyed some personal success. Among his fifties were innings of 67 against the touring Australian team and 61 in the University Match. He was included in different representative sides; he was selected in a Test trial, playing for the Rest, and played a second game against the Australians for the Gentlemen of England, although he did not pass fifty in either match. For the Gentlemen against the Players, Yardley scored 88.<ref name=figures/> He did not make the full England side but was [[Glossary of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] in two Tests against Australia.<ref name=H148/> His highest innings of the season was 97 for Yorkshire against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]],<ref name=figures/> and in all first-class matches, Yardley accumulated 1,217 runs at an average of 31.20 and took 22 wickets at 35.45.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

By this stage, Yorkshire regarded Yardley as the heir to [[Brian Sellers]] as captain,<ref name=H148/> and the England Test selectors also began to prepare him to assume the England captaincy. At the end of the 1938 season, Yardley was chosen to tour South Africa with MCC as vice-captain to [[Wally Hammond]].<ref name=Gibson175>Gibson, p. 175.</ref> He made a good start to the tour, scoring centuries in his first two innings, both surpassing his previous highest score.

Having built up a reputation as one of the best amateur cricketers in England,<ref name=coy/> Yardley played three early season matches for the MCC, but he was selected for neither the Gentlemen nor for England that year. He played his first full season for Yorkshire,<ref name=obit/> scoring centuries against Cambridge, [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] and Sussex;<ref name=figures/> in total, he scored 1,086 runs at an average of 27.84 and took 17 wickets.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

War brought first-class cricket to an end in 1939, and Yardley joined the first battalion of the [[Green Howards]], along with his Yorkshire team-mate [[Hedley Verity]]. After training in [[Omagh]], Northern Ireland, where he played several cricket matches with Verity,<ref>{{cite book  |last = Hill

In January 1944, he was wounded in Italy, rejoining the First Battalion in Iraq on his recovery to become an instructor, before being demobilised at the end of the war.<ref name=coy/>

==Career after the war==
===Tour to Australia in 1946<U+2013>47===
When County cricket resumed in England in 1946, Yorkshire won the County Championship.<ref name=obit/> Yardley scored 788 runs at an average of 23.17,<ref name=fcbatting/> with just one century, for Yorkshire against Nottinghamshire. With the ball, he was used less frequently than before the war and took only nine wickets.<ref name=fcbowling/> He was not selected for any Test matches, but appeared for England in a Test trial and scored 39 and 11. He also played twice for the MCC and represented the Gentlemen against the Players, making 29 and a duck in a heavy defeat for the amateurs.<ref name=figures/> Critics regarded his season as unsuccessful, but he was chosen as vice-captain to Hammond [[MCC tour of Australia in 1946<U+2013>47|on the tour to Australia that winter]], continuing his pre-war role.<ref name=Gibson175/>

It was intended that Yardley would appear lower down in the batting order, batting with a substantial total accumulated by the previous batsmen. However, the frailties of the England batting meant he often appeared in a crisis and had to rebuild several innings.<ref name=Wis48>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152882.html| title = MCC team in Australia and New Zealand, 1946<U+2013>47| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =30 July 2010}}</ref> [[Bill Bowes]], the Yorkshire and England bowler who covered the tour as a journalist, was impressed by Yardley's approach, noting that he did not back away from the fast bowlers, who frequently bowled [[Bouncer (cricket)|bouncers]] at him: "In fact, Yardley played cricket with a determination we had never seen in Yorkshire or in his days at the university."<ref name=B186>Bowes, p. 186.</ref> He made the greatest impression as a bowler, surprising commentators with his effectiveness. He did not bowl in the first six matches, but in his first over of the tour dismissed [[Arthur Morris]] who had already scored a century. From that point, he was used effectively to break up partnerships. In the Tests, he removed [[Donald Bradman]] in three successive innings, while in the third Test, he took two wickets, including Bradman, in two deliveries.<ref name=Wis48/> Bowes believed the natural [[Line and length#Length|length]] of Yardley's bowling was perfect for Australian pitches<U+2014>he was not skilful enough to alter the length at which he bowled so his bowling in other conditions was less effective.<ref name=B186/> The Australian reporter [[Clif Cary]] wrote "It was always amusing to watch the Englishmen when Yardley took a wicket. The first time they seemed fairly amused, but when he was regularly breaking partnerships, their enthusiasm knew no bounds, and it is said that in Melbourne after he had obtained Bradman's wicket for the third time, Yardley blushed profusely when one excited team-mate slapped him on the back and shouted "Well, bowled, [[Fred Spofforth|Spofforth]]".<ref>{{cite book |last= Cary |first = Cliff |title = Cricket Controversy: Test matches in Australia 1946-47 |publisher = T. Werner Laurie Ltd  |location = London |year = 1948}}</ref>

In the Tests, Yardley's only scores over fifty, his first in Test cricket, came in the third Test, where he scored 61 and 53 [[not out]]. In England's first innings, he helped his side to recover from a batting collapse, surviving for two hours. His second innings lasted 89 minutes and helped England to avoid defeat for the first time in the series. In the same match, Yardley bowled more overs than he had done previously on the whole tour, following injuries to [[Bill Voce]] and [[Bill Edrich]], two of England's main bowlers. Bowling [[leg theory]] with a fielders concentrated on the [[leg side]], Yardley managed to [[Seam bowling|move the ball off the seam]]. He dismissed Bradman twice in the match, having figures of three for 67 in the second innings and taking five wickets in the match.<ref name=figures/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152885.html| title = England v Australia 1946<U+2013>47 (third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =30 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=inns>{{Cite web| url = http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/23521.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings| title = Statsguru: NWD Yardley Test matches (innings by innings list)| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate =30 July 2010}}</ref> This was the first time that an England player had scored fifty runs in both innings and taken five wickets in a Test.<ref>Swanton, pp. 158<U+2013>59.</ref> Yardley also had substantial bowling workload in the fourth Test, delivering 31 overs in Australia's first innings to take three for 101.<ref name=figures/> When Hammond did not play in the final Test, Yardley became captain, doing so courageously according to ''Wisden'', which also pointed out that Yardley used field placing more effectively than Hammond.<ref name=Wis48/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152887.html

===England captain===
Yardley enjoyed his most successful season with the bat in [[1947 English cricket season|the 1947 season]], scoring 1,906 runs at an average of 44.32 with five centuries; his bowling took eleven wickets.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> Following Hammond's retirement immediately after the 1946<U+2013>47 tour, Yardley captained England against South Africa throughout the season. In the first Test, he made his highest Test score. England were unexpectedly made to [[follow on]] in the face of a large South African total; when Yardley came to the crease in the second innings, England looked likely to be defeated at 170 for four, still 155 runs behind the tourists. Yardley scored 99, being caught in the slips just before reaching his century, but his batting had helped to save the game and earned praise from ''Wisden'' for "batting soundly".<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152877.html| title = England v South Africa 1947 (first Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =3 August 2010}}</ref> Yardley and [[Denis Compton]] added 237, which was a record partnership for the fifth wicket in England and remains, in August 2010, England's best fifth wicket stand against South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=fow_wicket;opposition=3;orderby=fow_runs;team=1;template=results;type=fow;view=innings

===Playing the Invincibles===
Following Brian Sellers resignation, Yardley was appointed Yorkshire captain at the start of the 1948 season.<ref name=W377>Woodhouse, p. 377.</ref> With his England commitments and other absences, he only played in 12 County Championship matches.<ref name=figures/> He had not toured the West Indies with MCC in 1947<U+2013>48, when [[Gubby Allen]] captained the side. However, Yardley resumed his leadership of England when Australia, captained by Bradman, toured the country without losing a match. Yardley led the MCC in an early match against the tourists, and captained England in a Test trial, but only played three other games, all for Yorkshire, before the first Test, with a top score of 46.<ref name=figures/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18451.html| title = Marylebone Cricket Club v Australians in 1948| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =5 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18472.html| title = England v The Rest in 1948| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =5 August 2010}}</ref>

In the first Test, England were bowled out for 165 after Yardley won the toss and batted in difficult conditions. ''Wisden'' did not blame Yardley for the collapse as England did not bat well. He then set defensive fields to keep down Australia's scoring rate, taking a wicket himself with his fourth ball as part of figures of two for 32. The Australian batsmen found it difficult to score quickly against the negative tactics but still established a lead of 344. Yardley batted an hour in the second innings to score 22 but Australia recorded an eight wicket win.<ref name=figures/><ref name=inns/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152894.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (first Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =5 August 2010}}</ref> Before the second Test, Yardley played for Yorkshire against the Australians, and although unsuccessful with the bat, took two for nine with the ball, his first wickets of the season for his county.<ref name=figures/>

England adopted an aggressive strategy in the second Test, but could not avoid a second defeat. Yardley frequently changed his bowlers to unsettle the Australians in their first innings, and took two for 35 himself as England briefly held the advantage.<ref>Bowes, p. 189.</ref><ref name=2T48>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152895.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =5 August 2010}}</ref> However, the lower order batsmen mounted a recovery, Yardley being criticised for his reluctance to bowl [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]]. The England captain then arrested a batting collapse by adding 87 with Denis Compton, scoring 44 himself, but Australia led by 135 on first innings. Yardley took two wickets in two balls in Australia's second innings, narrowly missing a [[hat-trick]] when [[Keith Miller]] only just got his bat down on the ball to avoid being bowled, and had figures of two for 36, but Australia scored 460 for seven and bowled England out for 186.<ref name=figures/><ref name=2T48/> In between Tests, Yardley scored his only century of the season, but his contributions to the third Test were minimal. He scored 22 and bowled four wicketless overs.<ref name=figures/> However, the home side fought back in the match, for which Len Hutton was dropped. England scored 363 and bowled out Australia for 221. They scored 174 for three before declaring, but rain intervened to prevent Yardley pushing for a win.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152896.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =7 August 2010}}</ref>

England maintained their newly confident approach, being on top for most of the fourth Test.<ref name=B190>Bowes, pp. 190<U+2013>91.</ref><ref name=4T48>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (fourth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =7 August 2010}}</ref> Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared.<ref name=figures/> He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy [[Roller (agricultural tool)|roller]] to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply.<ref name=4T48/> However, England made several errors: [[Godfrey Evans]], the England [[wicket-keeper]] had a bad day and missed some [[Stump_(cricket)#Manner_of_dismissing_a_batsman|stumping chances]]; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, [[Jim Laker]], bowled poorly.<ref name=4T48/> Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner.<ref>Bowes, p. 191.</ref> Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and [[Arthur Morris]] added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball.<ref name=4T48/><ref>Gibson, pp. 188<U+2013>89.</ref> Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day.<ref name=B190/> Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long.<ref>Bowes, pp. 191<U+2013>92.</ref> ''Wisden'' also stated that England should have won the match.<ref name=4T48/>

Around this time, and particularly after the fourth Test defeat, critics suggested that [[Walter Robins]], one of the selectors, should captain England to bring a more attacking approach to the job. However, Robins' age counted against him; the selectors were satisfied with Yardley's captaincy in what were difficult circumstances, and retained him for the final Test.<ref>Gibson, p. 139.</ref> In that match, he failed twice with the bat, scoring 7 and 9 as England were humiliated, bowled out for 52 and 188 to lose by an innings.<ref name=figures/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152898.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (fifth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =8 August 2010}}</ref> England lost the series 4<U+2013>0. Yardley managed 150 runs at an average of 16.66, not passing fifty in a single innings.<ref name=tbat/> However, he once again topped the England bowling averages, taking nine wickets at an average of 22.66.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=1;type=series| title = The Ashes 1948: England batting and bowling averages| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate =8 August 2010}}</ref> Bowes believed that the pressure of captaincy had affected Yardley's batting. Bowes also cast doubt on Yardley's future, stating that other commitments may have prevented his continuing to play cricket much longer.<ref>Bowes, p. 194.</ref>

Yardley's only other representative appearance in 1948 was as captain of the Gentlemen against the Players at Lords, where he scored 61.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18580.html| title = Gentlemen v Players in 1948| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =8 August 2010}}</ref> In the whole season, he scored 1,061 runs at an average of 29.47 and 14 wickets at an average of 35.14<U+2014>he took just five wickets outside of the Tests.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/>

===Captain of Yorkshire===
Yardley was unavailable to captain the MCC tour of South Africa in the winter of 1948<U+2013>49, which was led by [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]]. Mann did well enough to retain the position for two Tests in the [[1949 English cricket season|1949 season]]; [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] captained the other two and Yardley did not play for England that year.<ref name=figures/><ref>Gibson, pp. 166, 175.</ref> In all first-class matches that season, he scored 1,612 runs at an average of 37.48 and took 22 wickets at an average of 33.86.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> He did not score a century in the County Championship, but passed three figures for Yorkshire against the New Zealand touring team and for the North against the South in a festival match.<ref name=figures/> His only representative game outside of festival matches was for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's; Mann was appointed captain for the game.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18981.html| title = Gentlemen v Players in 1949| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 August 2010}}</ref> That season, Yorkshire shared the County Championship with Middlesex, the only time Yorkshire won the competition during Yardley's leadership.<ref name=W377/>

Yardley's batting form dipped in the [[1950 English cricket season|1950 season]]. He scored 1,082 runs at an average of 24.59, the final time he reached four figures in a season. With the ball he took 19 wickets at an average of 32.10.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=fcbowling/> Yorkshire finished third in the County Championship behind joint winners Lancashire and Surrey.<ref name=ccposn>{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| edition = 2010| publisher = John Wisden & Co| chapter = LV County Championship: County Championship Final Positions 1890<U+2013>2010| page = 575}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1950.html| title = County Championship 1950 Points Table| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 August 2010}}</ref> It took seven matches for Yardley to reach fifty runs in an innings, but he hit centuries against Surrey, [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and Scotland in the second half of the season.<ref name=figures/> The West Indies toured England and Yardley resumed the England captaincy;<ref name=Gibson175/> he also captained MCC against the tourists and England against The Rest in a Test trial.<ref>{{Cite web| url =  http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/18/18981.html| title = Marylebone Cricket Club v West Indians in 1950| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/19/19281.html | title = England v The Rest in 1950| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate =13 August 2010}}</ref> However, neither Yardley nor Mann, the two likeliest candidates, were able to accept the captaincy of the MCC side in Australia that winter. The selectors spent much of the season assessing other players. Although Yardley represented the Gentlemen against the Players, the side was led by Brown, who scored a century and was appointed captain of the touring side. Brown also assumed the captaincy of England for the final Test against West Indies and Yardley was left out of the team.<ref>Gibson, pp. 180<U+2013>81.</ref> In the three Tests he played, Yardley scored 108 runs at an average of 18.00 with a top score of 41.<ref name=tbat/> He won the first Test but lost the next two, West Indies' first Test wins in England; the final Test was also lost by Brown.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155259.html| title = West Indies in England 1950 | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack  |year = 1951| publisher = John Wisden & Co.| accessdate =15 August 2010}}</ref> Following this series, Yardley did not play any more Tests, although his name was mentioned as a potential captain in 1953 before Hutton was appointed as England's first professional captain of the twentieth century. At the time, Yardley was still considered the best amateur candidate.<ref name=G176>Gibson, pp. 175<U+2013>76.</ref>  In 20 Tests, Yardley scored 812 runs at an average of 25.37 and four fifties. With the ball, he took 21 wickets at an average of 33.66.<ref name=cricinfo>{{Cite web| last = Frith | first = David |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/23521.html| title = Norman Yardley (player profile)| publisher = ESPNCricinfo| accessdate =15 August 2010}}</ref> On the fourteen occasions he was captain, he won four times, lost seven and drew three.<ref name=obit/>

Yorkshire finished second in the County Championship to Warwickshire in the [[1951 English cricket season|1951 season]] and second to Surrey in the [[1952 English cricket season|1952 season]]. However, in [[1953 English cricket season|following season]], Yorkshire dropped to equal twelfth, their worst ever finish at that time. In the following two seasons, the team were again runners up, Surrey winning on both occasions.<ref name=ccposn/> Yardley scored more than 850 runs in each season, but only managed two more centuries. These were 183 [[not out]] against Hampshire in 1951, the highest innings of his career, and an unbeaten score of exactly 100 against Gloucestershire in his final season. His batting average was generally between 24 and 31, except in 1953 when in matches in England he averaged 36.53.<ref name=figures/><ref name=fcbatting/> Yardley used himself as a bowler more often in 1951 and 1952, delivering more overs than any other time in his career in the latter year. He took 32 and 43 wickets respectively in each season, his highest two season totals, and taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions, having only done so twice before. However, he bowled less often during his final three seasons, with a subsequent drop in his tally of wickets.<ref name=fcbowling/> His only representative cricket, apart from annual matches at the Scarborough Festival for the Gentlemen against the Players and occasionally for T. N. Pearce's XI, was the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's in 1954.<ref name=figures/>

Judgements were mixed on Yardley's performance as Yorkshire's captain. His record would have been considered good at any other county, but not by the standards set by previous Yorkshire sides. Critics felt that Yorkshire should have won the Championship with the players available. Contemporaries believed him to be the best captain in the country tactically, taking reasonable chances without too many risks and judging players strengths and weakness. [[Trevor Bailey]], who played against him for Essex and under him for England, wrote that he thought him "an outstanding tactician and an expert on wicket behaviour. He was unquestionably one of the best captains I have ever played with or against. It has been said that he was too nice to lead Yorkshire, but I cannot think of anybody I have preferred playing under."<ref>Bailey, p. 141.</ref> [[Alan Gibson]] believed that unlike some county captains, Yardley was worth his place in the side on cricketing ability. However, he seemed unable to extract the best from his players.<ref name=G176/> [[Jim Kilburn]] noted that he used orthodox tactics, even when a different approach was called for, while other critics believed that he was shocked by the attitude of some difficult players in the side. Neither Yardley nor Hutton, his senior professional, were disciplinarians in the dressing room and kept apart from others. Both were frequently absent, playing in representative matches. This may have inflamed the situation, leading to accusations that some players were out of control.<ref name=H148/><ref name=obit/> Yardley disliked confrontation, and [[Ray Illingworth]], who played under him, described him as too nice to stand up to his players. But [[Bob Appleyard]], another of his former players, gives Yardley credit for recognising his potential and encouraging him to become a [[Spin bowling|spinner]], and believes that he and Hutton made a formidable pair of tacticians.<ref>Chalke and Hodgson, pp. 33, 127.</ref> Generally, he was popular with his players.<ref name=W377/>

Between 1951 and 1954, Yardley served as a Test selector, serving as chairman in 1952 at the time when Hutton was chosen as England captain.<ref name=obit/><ref>Gibson, p. 184.</ref> Following the [[1955 English cricket season|1955 season]], aged 40 and increasingly bothered by [[Low back pain|lumbago]], Yardley retired from the team. He ended his first-class career with 18,173 runs at an average of 31.17, and 279 wickets at an average of 30.48.<ref name=cricinfo/> ''Wisden'' later described him as "the finest Yorkshire amateur since [[Stanley Jackson|F. S. Jackson]]".<ref name=obit/>

==Style and technique==
Yardley had a good technique for batting.<ref name=Swanton>Swanton, p. 159.</ref> He possessed a fluent, attractive style, and his height allowed him to reach the ball and [[Batting_(cricket)#Drive|drive]] more comfortably than most. His best shots were on the [[leg side]], using his strong wrists to turn the ball away when it was aimed towards his legs.<ref name=obit/> Yardley performed best when his side was in difficulty, and he could play attacking or defensive innings depending on the situation.<ref>Chalke and Hodgson, p. 127</ref> He bowled intelligently, leading to greater rewards than his gentle style led opponents to expect, but remained a reluctant bowler who was surprised by his own success. He was a good fielder in positions close to the batsmen.<ref name=H148/><ref name=W377/><ref name=Swanton/>

==Career after cricket==
Yardley worked as a wine merchant outside cricket.<ref name=W377/> After his retirement from playing he worked as a cricket journalist and served as an expert summariser on ''[[Test Match Special]]'' from 1956 until 1969, as well as in 1973.<ref>{{cite book |last = Martin-Jenkins |first = Christopher |title = Ball by Ball: The Story of Cricket Broadcasting |publisher = Grafton Books |year = 1990 |isbn = 0-246-13568-9|pages = 181-187}}</ref> According to [[David Frith]], the only time he was moved to express severe disapproval was when [[Brian Close]] was dismissed after a poor shot in the Fourth Test in 1961 at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]];<ref name=cricinfo/> this was part of a final-day England collapse that handed Australia the match and a 2<U+2013>1 series win after the hosts had been on course for victory and the series lead. Trevor Bailey, who was a colleague in the commentary box for the later part of Yardley's time with Test Match Special, wrote: "I always considered Norman Yardley to be an ideal summariser: accurate, informative and very sensible, and able to explain not only what happened but also the reasons why. His knowledge about pitches, tactics and the technicalities of the game was exceptional... Articulate, expert, and possessing considerable charge <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki>, I thought his interpretation of events on the field and his post-session summaries were sound, balanced and never less than fair."<ref>Bailey, pp. 223<U+2013>224.</ref>

He served on the Yorkshire Cricket Committee,<ref name=W378>Woodhouse, p. 378.</ref> and from 1981, he was Yorkshire President. However, he became involved in the controversy surrounding [[Geoffrey Boycott]], to whom the committee had decided not to give a new contract. Yardley resigned early in 1984 after a vote of no confidence, dismayed by the attitude of Boycott's supporters.<ref name=cricinfo/><ref>{{Cite news | title = Yardley could give up presidency over rebels {{subscription}}| newspaper = The Times  | location = London  | page = 28 | date = 5 November 1983| url = http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?toDate=1984-05-31&fromDate=1983-01-01&currentPageNumber=1&resultsPerPage=10&sortBy=-archiveissuedate&offset=0&viewName=&addFilters=&removeFilters=&addCat=&queryKeywords=Norman+Yardley&sectionId=1040&currPgSmartSet=1&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1983-11-05-28&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1983-11-05-28-014&origPageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1983-11-05-28&origArticleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1983-11-05-28-014&xmlpath=&pubId=17&totalResults=6&addRefineFilters=@content%3Ayorkshire&removeRefineFilters=&addRefineCat=&additionalKeyword=%2Cyorkshire&next_Page=false&prev_Page=false&date_dd_From=1&date_mm_From=01&date_yyyy_From=1983&date_dd_to_range=31&date_mm_to_range=05&date_yyyy_to_range=1984&date_dd_from_precise=1&date_mm_from_precise=01&date_yyyy_from_precise=1983&isDateSearch=false&dateSearchType=range&refineQuerykeywordText= | accessdate =17 August 2010}}</ref> Anthony Woodhouse wrote in his history of Yorkshire: "he conducted affairs in a fair and unbiased manner.
