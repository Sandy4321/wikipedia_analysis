[[Image:Argyle Station 19160116.jpg|thumb|left|The new embankment at Argyle Station in 1916]]
The site of Argyle station was first used as depot called ''Argyle Park'' on the Evanston branch of the [[Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad]] route, which opened in 1886.<ref>{{cite book |title=Creating Chicago's North Shore |last=Ebner |first=Michael |year=1988 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0226182053 |page=116 }}</ref> In 1908 the [[Northwestern Elevated Railroad]] was extended north from Wilson, using the tracks of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad, and a new station was constructed on the site of the previous depot.<ref name=ChicagoL.org>''[http://chicago-l.org/stations/argyle.html Argyle.]'' Chicago-"L".org (URL accessed [[8 October]] [[2006]]).</ref>  The station was again rebuilt to a design by architect Charles P. Rawson when the tracks between [[Wilson (CTA)|Wilson]] and [[Howard (CTA)|Howard]] were elevated onto an embankment between 1914 and 1922.<ref name=Borzo /> The station was renovated in 1991 and a Chinese-style hipped-and-gabled roof was added to the platform canopy.
