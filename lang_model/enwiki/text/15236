'''Truman Carol Kimbro''' (May 27, 1919-December 19, 1944) was a [[United States Army]] soldier and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration<U+2014>the [[Medal of Honor]]<U+2014>for his actions in [[World War II]].

==Biography==
Kimbro joined the Army from [[Houston, Texas]] in 1941, and by December 19, 1944 was serving as a [[technician fourth grade]] in Company C, 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion, [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]]. On that day, he was assigned to lead a [[squad]] in the [[land mine|mining]] of a crossroads near [[Rocherath]], [[Belgium]]. Finding that the area was covered by enemy forces, he left his men in a protected position and went forward alone. Although wounded on his approach, he continued on his mission and successfully laid mines across the road before being killed by enemy fire. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor five months later, on May 24, 1945.

Kimbro was buried at the [[Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery]] in [[Henri-Chapelle]], [[Belgium]]. His grave can be located in Plot F Row 6 Grave 28.

==Medal of Honor citation==
Technician Fourth Grade Kimbro's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
<blockquote>On 19 December 1944, as scout, he led a squad assigned to the mission of mining a vital crossroads near Rocherath, Belgium. At the first attempt to reach the objective, he discovered it was occupied by an enemy [[tank]] and at least 20 infantrymen. Driven back by withering fire, Technician 4th Grade Kimbro made 2 more attempts to lead his squad to the crossroads but all approaches were covered by intense enemy fire. Although warned by our own infantrymen of the great danger involved, he left his squad in a protected place and, laden with mines, crawled alone toward the crossroads. When nearing his objective he was severely wounded, but he continued to drag himself forward and laid his mines across the road. As he tried to crawl from the objective his body was riddled with rifle and machinegun fire. The mines laid by his act of indomitable courage delayed the advance of enemy [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armor]] and prevented the rear of our withdrawing columns from being attacked by the enemy.</blockquote>

==Honored in ship naming==
The [[U.S. Army]] ship [[USAT Sgt. Truman Kimbro|USAT ''Sgt. Truman Kimbro'']] which served in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at the end of [[World War II]] was named in his honor.
