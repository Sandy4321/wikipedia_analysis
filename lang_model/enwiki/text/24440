The '''PIAT''', for ''Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank'', was one of the earlier [[anti-tank weapon]]s based on a [[HEAT]] shell. It was developed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] starting in 1941, reaching the field in time for the [[Operation Husky|invasion of Sicily]] in 1943. Due to the nature of the projectile and length of the weapon, the PIAT could be used more easily in enclosed spaces than the American [[bazooka]] or its German copy, the [[Panzerschreck]], which made it more useful in close-combat and for [[urban warfare]]. 

One problem reported with the PIAT was that the bombs it fired were quite sensitive, due to the special firing mechanism, and if dropped could explode. Hence some bombs were given special caps over the ignition device to prevent this. The bomb had to be positioned correctly or it would not fire and would have to be removed, the gun re-cocked taking time before it could be fired again.

==History==

[[Image:PIAT.jpg|thumb|300 px|PIAT in use by Canadian troops]]
At the start of [[World War II]], all major armies were investing in research into [[HEAT]] to produce an infantry weapon capable of defeating modern armor. The US and Germans concentrated on [[rocket]]s to propel their weapons, but in 1941 when the PIAT was being developed, these systems were nowhere near ready for use.

The British instead turned to a prewar weapon known as the [[Blacker Bombard]], a large [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] type of weapon, known as a "spigot discharger" or [[mortar (weapon)#Spigot mortar|spigot mortar]], invented by [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lt-Col]] Blacker, [[Royal Artillery|RA]]. The Bombard consisted of a heavy "barrel" containing a large spring. The spring pushed against a 12 pound (5 kg) steel canister and rod that rode up the barrel and struck the rear of the bomb, igniting a small propulsion charge. The heavy bolt and rod, known as the ''spigot'', was used primarily to damp out the recoil of the round leaving the barrel. The charge was also intended to reset the spring, meaning that the weapon had to be cocked only once, by pulling up on the tube while standing on a handle mounted at the rear.

The Blacker Bombard was never used operationally, and was retained for use by the [[British Home Guard|Home Guard]]. However the design was suitable for modification as the launcher for a HEAT round. The drop in size of warhead required (an effective HEAT shell was 3 lb compared to the 20 lb HE used on the Bombard) meant that the PIAT would be much lighter and maneuvreable than the Bombard's 150 kg mass. A section of the "barrel" was cut away on the top to form a tray for the round, which could be reloaded  with fresh rounds with the operator remaining prone. The charge on the shell was small enough that it caused no real smoke or backblast, a significant advantage over the [[bazooka]]. However, the heavy duty spring and spigot pushed the weight up, resulting in a weapon that weighed 34 pounds (15 kg) unloaded. Furthermore, if the charge failed to reset the spigot, which happened often enough (especially when the firer could not take the recoil), the operator had to retire behind cover to re-cock the weapon. This required a 200 pound pull, and to get the necessary pull the user needed to stand up. 

In general use the PIAT had a rated range of about 100 m, but that was considered the extreme and it was typically fired at much shorter ranges. The three pound (1.4 kg) HEAT warhead was able to penetrate about 55 mm of armor at 100 m. This was too little to defeat the frontal armor of the newer German designs, but remained effective against side and rear armor. The PIAT could also function in a mortar-like role, where the shell was fired in a parabolic arc up to 350 m. The PIAT was also widely used in the "house-breaking" role, being fired into a room near the proposed assault team's entrance.

An attachement that allowed the PIAT to fire [[British 2 inch mortar|2in mortar]] shells, was produced in limited numbers.

==Combat use==
Early use in Sicily proved that a "perfect" hit was required or the round would not detonate, and the weapon soon garnered a poor reputation among the troops. The Army then instigated a rapid series of improvements, and the weapon had matured by the time of the invasion of the Italian mainland. The PIAT could then be found in all theatres, although the slow reload time meant it was generally considered a one-shot-per-confrontation weapon due to the extremely heavy spring. 
On the morning of the [[D-Day]] landings, a single PIAT disrupted a German attempt to reach the invasion beaches. Troops had landed by glider and had seized and held the vital bridges over the [[Caen Canal]] and the [[Orne River]]. Among the positions held was a "T-junction" on the  main road from [[Benouville]] to [[Le Port]] which led on to [[Caen]]. A German force of two armoured half-tracks followed by some infantry approached the junction. Sgt. "Wagger" Thornton (D Company) [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry]] armed with the only working PIAT and two rounds shot the lead half-track armed with a cannon at short range. The sergeant lay unprotected and flat on his belly on the left side of the road deck. The shot impacted exactly the right spot and the vehicle blew up, Thornton's second man armed with a [[Sten gun]]. The half-track burning, exploding and thrown upside down, was now blocking the junction for medium vehicles and preventing the German counter-attack from reaching the beaches. The explosion forced the remaining Germans to withdraw, and the commander of the vehicle behind the one destroyed by Thornton reported back to his superior saying that the British were armed with 6-pounder anti-tank guns (he believed this to be the case due to the ferocity of the explosion). However, Sgt. Thornton personally expressed dislike for "that bloody weapon".<ref>See ''Pegasus Bridge'' by Stephen E. Ambrose; for correcting reports on Ambrose's book, see now contemporary report on Sgt. Charles Thornton's [[Military Medal]]; by Brigadier the [[Lord Lovat]] and by paratrooper John Butler (of the 7th Para Battalion) who all state that that they had seen a burning half-track on [[June 6]], not any "tank". Confirmation obtained by M. Jacquinot, director Mus<U+00E9>e Memorial Pegasus at Benouville.</ref>

Private [[Ernest Smith|Ernest Alvia "Smokey" Smith]] of the [[Seaforth Highlanders of Canada]] earned the [[Victoria Cross]] after crawling to within ten metres of a [[Pz III G tank]] to destroy it with a PIAT. 

In one of the most remarkable examples of bravery under fire, Major [[Robert Henry Cain]] also earned the Victoria Cross at Arnhem during [[Operation Market Garden]].  Using a PIAT gun (in addition to several other weapons) he destroyed or disabled two tanks, one of which was a Pz II, as well as a self-propelled gun.

The PIAT remained the main British platoon-level anti-tank weapon until 1950, when it was replaced by the US M20 ''Super Bazooka'', known as ''Launcher, Rocket, 3.5 inch UK (M20)'' in British service and then later by the ubiquitous [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]].

The naval weapon [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] was another application of the spigot discharger principle.
