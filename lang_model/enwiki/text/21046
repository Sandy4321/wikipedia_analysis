George III]]. The story in the novel was an allegory for the [[Japanese American Internment|internment of Japanese Americans]] during the [[Second World War]], and was inspired by [[George Takei]]'s experiences during that period.

[[Grand Nagus Zek]] is refusing to sell one of the lost Orbs of the [[Prophets (Star Trek)|Prophets]] back to [[Bajoran|Bajor]]. In response, the Bajoran government cuts off all diplomatic ties with the Ferengi and outlaws all Ferengi businesses within its borders. Quark first loses his bar, and then is subsequently imprisoned. But he finds himself to be the only one who can prevent a war between his people and Bajor.

==Development history==
After [[Eric Stillwell]] and [[David R. George III(writer)|David R. George III]] successfully pitched to ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' for the episode "[[Prime Factors (Star Trek: Voyager)|Prime Factors]]", Stillwell and actor [[Armin Shimmerman]] pitched ideas to ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. Although they were unsuccessful,<ref name=georgeinterview>{{cite web|title=David R.

The majority of the book was written by George, who said that Shimmerman simply agreed with most of what he wrote. The two worked together on plotting out the story, which was intended to be a deliberate allegory for the Japanese Americans internment. The title was a reference to the [[Ferengi]] [[Rules of Acquisition]], with the 34th rule stating "War is good for business".<ref name=georgeinterview/> After work was completed on ''The 34th Rule'', George talked with another ''DS9'' actor, [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]], about a potential book project. This went on to become ''[[A Stitch in Time (novel)|A Stitch in Time]]''.<ref name=amazon>{{cite web|last=Sourbut|first=Liz|title=Tailor Made|url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=53485|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}</ref>
