'''''JumpStart Advanced 2nd Grade''''' is a [[personal computer game]] created by [[Knowledge Adventure]]. It replaced the previous ''[[JumpStart 2nd Grade]]'' released in 1996.

Like the original version, this game prominently features the [[frog]] C.J. and his sidekick Edison the [[Firefly]], but also includes the [[rabbit]] Mr. Hopsalot, who originally appeared in ''[[JumpStart Kindergarten (1994 version)|JumpStart Kindergarten]]''. The plot, however, is quite different from the original and involves a Dr. O [[vandalism|vandalizing]] "[[Mount Rushmore|Mount Jumpmore]]" by painting moustaches on all the faces.
