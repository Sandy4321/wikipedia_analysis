The '''[[Yakovlev (aircraft)|Yakovlev]] Yak-12''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: '''<U+042F><U+043A>-12''', [[NATO reporting name]]: "Creek") is a light multirole [[aircraft]] used by the [[VVS|Soviet Air Force]], Soviet civilian aviation and other countries from [[1947 in aviation|1947]] onwards.

==History==
The Yak-12 was designed by [[Alexander Sergeevich Yakovlev|Yakovlev]]'s team to meet a requirement of the Soviet Air Force of [[1944 in aviation|1944]] for a new liaison and utility plane, to replace the obsolete [[Polikarpov Po-2|Po-2]] biplane. It was also meant to be used in civil aviation as a successor to Yakovlev's [[Yakovlev AIR-6|AIR-6]] of [[1934 in aviation|1934]], built in a relatively small series. Yakovlev's first proposal was a 4-seater high-wing [[Yakovlev Yak-10|Yak-10]] (first named Yak-14), built in January [[1945 in aviation|1945]]. It won the competition with a low-wing [[Yakovlev Yak-13|Yak-13]], based on the same fuselage, and a small number of Yak-10s were produced, powered with a [[Shvetsov M-11]]M radial engine (108 kW, 145 hp).

In [[1947 in aviation|1947]], the aircraft was rebuilt, fitted with a more powerful M-11FR radial engine (119 kW, 160 hp), a new wing and a fuselage with a revised shape. The new plane was designated '''Yak-12'''. 788 were produced of the basic variant, including military observation planes, some '''Yak-12S''' [[air ambulance]]s, '''Yak-12SKh''' [[agricultural aircraft]] and '''Yak-12GR''' [[floatplane]]s. A distinguishing feature of the basic Yak-12, just like Yak-10, were engine cylinders with individual cowlings. It was a plane of mixed construction.

A next generation of Yak-12s entered production in [[1952 in aviation|1952]], starting with the '''Yak-12R'''. It was fitted with a new [[Ivchenko AI-14]]R radial engine (194 kW, 260 hp), all hidden in the fuselage, and the plane construction became all-metal. After further construction strengthening and other minor changes, from [[1955 in aviation|1955]] the '''Yak-12M''' (for "modified") was produced. A visible difference was a lengthened tailfin. This variant became more universal, and could be fitted with twin controls for training, [[stretcher]]s for an ambulance role or agricultural spraying device.

The last generation, produced from [[1957 in aviation|1957]], was the '''Yak-12A'''. It was an [[aerodynamics|aerodynamically]] refined variant, with a slimmer fuselage. The engine cover had a smaller diameter. The rectangular-shaped wings were fitted with trapezoidal ends, and single [[strut]]s replaced twin struts. Navigation equipment and controls were improved, and performance also increased. In the USSR, 3,801 of Yak-12s were built in all models (including 3,013 Yak-12R, M and A). An experimental '''Yak-12B''' [[biplane]] was also developed, but not produced. 

The Yak-12M was licence built from [[1956 in aviation|1956]] in Poland in the [[PZL|WSK-4 Okecie]], as '''Jak-12M''' (Polish spelling of Russian name). From [[1959 in aviation|1959]], the Yak-12A was built in Poland as the '''Jak-12A'''. 1,054 Jak-12Ms and 137 Jak-12As were built in Poland, most exported to the USSR. In [[1958 in aviation|1958]], further development of the Yak-12 was carried out in Poland, designated as the [[PZL-101 Gawron]]. 

The Yak-12 was also produced in [[China]] as '''Shenyang type 5'''.

==Usage==
Yak-12s first entered service in the Soviet Air Force as a liaison and artillery observation plane. Then, they were used also in the Soviet civilian aviation - mostly in the [[DOSAAF]] aero club for transport, pilot training, [[parachute]] training, and [[glider]] towing. They were also used as [[air ambulance]]s and [[agricultural aircraft]]. 

Apart from the USSR, Yak-12s were used in [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] - in civilian and military aviation, and in [[Hungary|Hungarian]] civilian aviation. Licence built Shenyangs were used in China and other countries.

In the [[Polish Air Force]], Yak-12s (transcribed in Poland as Jak-12) were used from 1951, as liaison, patrol and general utility planes. Most were withdrawn in the [[1970s]], the last in the [[1980s]]. In the Polish civilian aviation they were used from 1952, in bigger numbers from 1956. They were used in aeroclubs and as flying ambulances. 

Some Yak-12s (mostly Yak-12A) remain in use until today (2004) in the world's civilian aviation.

==Description==
Metal construction (Yak-12R, M, A) or mixed construction (Yak-12) braced high-wing utility plane, conventional in layout, metal and canvas covered. Wings fitted with [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] and [[slats]]. Four seat cabin (in early variant Yak-12 - 2 or 3 seat). Conventional fixed [[landing gear]] with tail wheel. 

Single [[radial engine]]: 5-cylinder M-11FR (nominal power 104 kW/140 hp, take-off power 118 kW/160 hp) - Yak-12 basic variant; 9-cylinder AI-14R (nominal power 161 kW/220 hp, take-off power 191 kW/260 hp) - Yak-12R, M and A. Two-blade propeller. Two fuel tanks in wings, 225 l (55 US gal) each.
