A concept first named by [[Richard Thaler]] (1980), '''mental accounting''' attempts to describe the process whereby people code, categorise and evaluate [[economic]] outcomes. Mental [[accounting]] theorists argue that people group their assets into a number of non-[[fungible]] mental accounts. 

One detailed application of mental accounting, the [[behavioural life cycle hypothesis]] (Shefrin & Thaler, 1988), posits that people mentally frame assets as belonging to either current income, current wealth or future income and this has implications for their behaviour as the accounts are largely non-fungible and [[marginal propensity to consume]] out of each account is different. 

== Mental accounting, utility, value and transaction ==

In mental accounting theory, ''framing'' means that the way a person subjectively frames a transaction in their mind will determine the [[utility]] they receive or expect. This concept is similarly used in [[prospect theory]], and many mental accounting theorists adopt that theory as the [[value function]] in their analyses.  

Another very important concept used to understand mental accounting is that of [[modified utility function]]. There are 2 [[Value (economics)|value]]s attached to any transaction - acquisition value and transaction value. ''Acquisition value'' is the money that one is ready to part with for physically acquiring some good. ''Transaction value'' is the value one attaches to having a good deal. If the price that one is paying is equal to the mental reference price for the good, the transaction value is zero. If the price is lower than the reference price, the transaction utility is positive.

== Mental accounting cost ==

More generally, a '''mental accounting cost''' or '''mental transaction cost''', a kind of [[transaction cost]], is the cost of making a useful decision, especially of a consumer making a useful decision to buy, and may set a lower bound on useful price granularity in a market.  In a software engineering context the latter phrase refers to the cost to the user of making a useful selection in the user interface, in contrast to a computational transaction cost such as CPU, memory, or network usage.
