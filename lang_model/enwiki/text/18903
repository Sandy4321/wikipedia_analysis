'''Gai<U+00E4>nt'wak<U+00EA>''' ('''Kaintwakon'''; generally known as '''Cornplanter'''; c. 1750 <U+2013> February 18, 1836) was a [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]] war-chief. He was the son of a [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] mother, Aliquipiso, and a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] father, Johannes Abeel.  He also carried the name John Abeel (sometimes spelled O'Bail) after his [[fur]] trader father.  He was born at Canawaugus (now in the [[Caledonia (town), New York|Town of Caledonia]]) on the [[Genesee River]] in present-day [[New York]] State around 1750 and was raised by his mother.<ref name="phmc">{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/people/4277/chief_cornplanter/443542|title=Chief Cornplanter |accessdate=2010-02-26 |publisher= Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission}}</ref>

Cornplanter decided that he would plant crops and live peacefully; hence his English name, Cornplanter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} His Seneca name, Gai<U+00E4>nt'wak<U+00EA> (often spelled Gyantwachia), means <U+201C>the planter,<U+201D> and another variation, Kaintwakon, means <U+201C>by what one plants.<U+201D>

Cornplanter was half-brother to [[Handsome Lake]], a Seneca religious leader of the Iroquois people, and uncle to [[Governor Blacksnake]], a Seneca warchief.

==American Revolutionary War==
As a war chief, Cornplanter had been hesitant about fighting during the American Revolution.  He felt the Iroquois should stay out of the white man's war. "War is war," he told other Iroquois.  "Death is death.  A fight is a hard business." He finally gave in to pressure and several times helped the British.
During the [[American Revolution]], Chief Cornplanter and his uncle, Chief [[Guyasuta|Guyasutha]], wanted the [[Haudenosaunee]] to remain neutral, as both the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Patriots]] had originally urged them to. However, soon both sides wanted the [[Iroquois]] to fight with them, and the British offered them large amounts of goods. The Iroquois League met together at [[Oswego County, New York|Oswego]] in July, 1777, to vote on their decision. Although Guysutha and Cornplanter voted for neutrality, when the majority voted to side with the British they both honored the majority decision . Because of the status of the Seneca as War Chiefs among the Haudenosaunee, most of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] followed suit. The Iroquois named [[Sayenqueraghta]] and Cornplanter as war-chiefs of the [[Iroquois]].

Cornplanter joined forces with [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] Lt. Colonel [[John Butler (pioneer)|John Butler]] and his [[Butler's Rangers|rangers]] at the 1778 Battle of [[Wyoming Valley]], which came to be known as the [[Wyoming Valley Massacre]].

After the burning of Tioga by Patriot forces under Colonel [[Thomas Hartley]], Cornplanter and Brant also participated in the 1778 Loyalist-Iroquois reprisal led by Captain [[Walter Butler]] and [[Butler's Rangers]] in [[Cherry Valley (town), New York|Cherry Valley]], later called the [[Cherry Valley Massacre]]. During this campaign, Cornplanter's men incidentally captured his father after burning his house. Cornplanter, who had once gone to see him as a young man, recognized him and offered apology, inviting him to return with the Senecas or to go back to his [[White people|white]] family. His father chose the latter, and Cornplanter sent Seneca warriors to take Johannes Abeel there in safety.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

After the victories of the Loyalist and Iroquois forces, commander-in-chief General [[George Washington]] commissioned Major General [[John Sullivan]] to invade [[Iroquois|Six Nation]] territory and "destroy" Iroquois villages. There was one brief [[Battle of Newtown|battle]] of this campaign in which the Iroquois and British troops were decisively defeated at [[Elmira, New York|Newtown]]. Sullivan and his army of 5,000 men conducted a [[scorched earth]] campaign, methodically destroying Iroquois villages, farms, and animals between May and September of 1779 throughout the Iroquois homeland (upstate New York).<ref name="sullivan">{{cite web |url= http://www.earlyamerica.com/review/1998/sullivan.html |title=The 1779 Sullivan Campaign: A Little-Known Offensive Strategic To The War Breaks The Indian Nations' Power |accessdate=2006-11-11 |author= Stanley J. Adamiak}}</ref> Cornplanter, along with [[Joseph Brant]], [[Old Smoke]], and Lt. Colonel [[John Butler]] fought a desperate delaying action in order to allow the escape of many refugees, both Native and non-Native{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. The Patriot revenge was successful, and those who survived suffered terribly during the following months in what they called <U+201C>the winter of the deep snow.<U+201D> Many froze or starved to death. Cornplanter's people continued to fight with the British against the Patriots.

==Post-Revolutionary War years==
After the devastating loss to the Iroquois brought about by the [[Sullivan Expedition]] as well as Britain's final defeat in the war, Cornplanter recognized the advantage of a positive diplomatic relationship with the fledgling government of what the Haudenosaunee called the "Thirteen Fires." He became a negotiator in disputes between the new "Americans" and the Seneca as well as other indigenous tribes, even participating in meetings with both Presidents Washington and [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]. He was one of the signers of the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]].<ref name="phmc"/>

During the [[Northwest Indian War]] in [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]] immediately after the American Revolution, Cornplanter was able to keep the Iroquois neutral and tried to negotiate with the [[Shawnee]] on behalf of the U.S.

In 1790, Cornplanter and his brother [[Half-Town]] (also a chief) traveled to [[Philadelphia]] to meet with President George Washington and [[Pennsylvania]] Governor [[Thomas Mifflin]] and protest the current treatment of their people. Cornplanter and Half-Town extracted an agreement from Washington and Mifflin to protect Iroquois land. [see: '''''The speech of the Cornplanter ...''''', December 1, 1790, at external links.]

Cornplanter made many trips to the cities to strengthen relationships and dialog with those who were interested in his people. He took it upon himself to understand the ways of the white men, as he saw it necessary for future relations between the Haudenosaunee and Americans. He was particularly impressed by the beliefs and practice of the [[Quakers]], and invited them to educate his son and develop schools. He and his half-brother, the religious leader Handsome Lake, strongly opposed liquor.

During the [[War of 1812]] Cornplanter supported the American cause, convincing his people to do so as well. At one point he offered to bring two hundred warriors to assist the U.S., but his offer was refused. 

He allowed Quakers into his village to help the Senecas learn new skills when they could no longer rely on hunting or the fur trade as a way of life.  He also encouraged men to join the women working in the fields to help increase their farming economy. 

Eventually, Cornplanter became disillusioned with his relationship with the Americans. To help fight the drunkenness and despair experienced by many Indians, his half-brother Handsome Lake preached that the Iroquois must return to the traditional Indian way of life and take part in religious ceremonies. Cornplanter felt his people were receiving increasingly poor treatment at the hands of the Americans, and this confirmed for him Handsome Lake's warning that they should return to tradition and turn away from assimilation to white ways. He burned his military uniform, broke his sword, and destroyed his medals. While he also closed the schools, he never broke off relations with the Quakers and retained a relationships of love and respect with them.

Cornplanter died in Warren County, Pennsylvania, in 1836. He requested a grave with no marker.  A monument has been constructed over his grave.

==The Cornplanter Tract==
In gratitude for his assistance to the state, Cornplanter was given a grant of {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} by [[Pennsylvania]] in 1796 along the western bank of the [[Allegheny River]] (about three miles (5&nbsp;km) below the southern boundary of New York state) to him and his heirs "forever".<ref name="phmc"/> By 1798, 400 Seneca lived on the land, which was called the Cornplanter Tract or Cornplanter Grant. In 1821 [[Warren County, Pennsylvania]] attempted to require Cornplanter pay taxes for his land, which he protested on the basis that the land had been "granted" to him by the U.S. government. After much talk, the state finally agreed that the Cornplanter Tract was exempt.

==Legacy==
Cornplanter's last living direct descendant was Seneca artist and traditionalist, [[Jesse Cornplanter]] (1889<U+2013>1957).<ref name="bio">Lester, Patrick D. ''The Biographical Directory of Native American Painters.'' Tulsa, OK: SIR Publications, 1995: 125</ref>

In 1965, the new [[Kinzua Dam]] at [[Warren, Pennsylvania]] permanently flooded the Cornplanter Tract and created [[Allegheny Reservoir]]. Cornplanter's grave was subsequently moved to higher ground; the State of Pennsylvania erected an honorary marker in 1966.<ref name="phmc"/> Most of Cornplanter's people moved to the [[Allegany Reservation]] in [[New York]].

The moving of his grave (which conflicted with the promise that his land grant would be his and his heirs "forever") figures in the song, "[[Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian|As Long As The Grass Shall Grow]]" that [[Johnny Cash]] recorded in 1964; it was originally written by [[Peter LaFarge]].

The [[Chief Cornplanter Council|Chief Cornplanter]] [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] Council, headquartered in Warren, as well as their [[Order of the Arrow]] lodge, [http://webpages.atlanticbb.net/~wilsric/lodge255/ Gyantwachia Lodge #255] are named in his honor.

[[Cornplanter State Forest]] in [[Forest County, Pennsylvania]] is also named for him and comprises {{convert|1256|acre|km2}} of land.
