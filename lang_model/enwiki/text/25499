'''John Wycliffe Black''' (21 July 1862 <U+2013> 18 June 1951) <ref>http://www.leighrayment.com/commons/Hcommons1.htm</ref> was an English shoe manufacturer and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician.



==Family and education==
John Wycliffe Black was born in London, the son of Robert Black, a successful [[Knightsbridge]] draper<ref>http://www.mcculloughblack.4t.com/</ref> He was sent to [[Bishop's Stortford College]] in [[Essex]] for his schooling. <ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> In 1890 he married Eunice Marsden from [[Wigan]] in [[Lancashire]] and they had one son and a daughter. Their son Arthur Norman Black (1894-1973) was a celebrated motor cycle and racing car driver of the 1930s and 1940s. <ref>http://www.normanblack.150m.com/</ref> Adventurous activity runs in the Black family, John Wycliffe Black's nephew Tom Campbell Black (1899-1936), was a pioneer aviator. <ref>http://www.tomcampbellblack.150m.com/</ref>

==Religion==
Black was a staunch churchman and temperance supporter. <ref>Alfred Thomas DeGroot, ''The restoration principle''; Bethany Press, 1960 p178</ref> He was Chairman of the Evangelistic Committee of Churches of Christ and in 1932 was President of the World Council of the Disciples of Christ. <ref>''The American Year Book: A Record of Events and Progress;'' D. Appleton and Company., 1936 p586</ref> <ref>Family information</ref>

==Career and politics==
Black was in manufacturing and for some time too ran an estate agency in Kensington with his brother, Robert Wilson Black. <ref>Oliver Marriott, ''The property boom''; H. Hamilton, 1967 p23</ref> It was clear he was, at least for a time, quite a wealthy man. When he was Chairman of the Harborough Divisional Liberal Association in 1919, he was engaged in correspondence with [[Sir Percy Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Percy Harris]] who had been the Liberal [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Harborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Harborough]] between 1916-1918. The dispute centred on the amount of money Harris was expected to contribute if he wished to remain as Parliamentary candidate. In the end Harris was not able to meet the requirements of the Liberal Association and moved to another constituency. The need then arose for Harborough Liberals to select another candidate and Black was adopted. One of the chief reasons his adoption was Black<U+2019>s ability to finance the local party from his own resources. Once Black ceased to provide funds for the Association in the mid-1920s, they had to stop paying the salary of the full-time official they engaged and by March 1927 they were unable even to afford their affiliation fee to the Midland Liberal Federation. <ref>Chris Cook, ''The Age of Alignment: Electoral politics in Britain, 1922-1929,'' Macmillan, 1975 pp40-41</ref>
 
Black was an elected member of [[Leicestershire County Council]] before being made an [[Alderman]]. He remained an Alderman of the county until his death in 1951 by which time he had acquired the courtesy title of <U+2018>father of the council<U+2019>. <ref>The Times, 5 July 1951 p8</ref> He stood for election to Parliament in Harborough three times. First in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922 general election]] when he came second in a three-cornered contest to the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, Sir Keith Fraser, with [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in third place. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]], Black again faced Fraser but this time in a straight fight and he took the seat with a majority of 1,304 votes. For the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924 general election]] however, Labour re-entered the fray and as the Liberals suffered a national decline, the Conservatives regained the seat and Labour took second place, relegating Black to the foot of the poll. <ref>F W S Craig, ''British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949''; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p411</ref>

Black also served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Leicestershire. <ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>

==Health politics==
Black took an interest in various health related political issues. He was a member of the Council of the National Institute for the Blind, representing the County Councils Association <ref>The Times, 8 January 1930 p12</ref> and later served on the Advisory Committee on the Welfare of the Blind, which reported to the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]]. <ref>The Times, 4 July 1934 p11</ref> He also took an interest in issues relating to Mental Health. He was sometime chairman of the Mental Hospital Association <ref>The Times, 14 July 1937 p9</ref> and served on a Ministry of Health committee to inquire into scientific and ancillary mental health services. <ref>The Times, 19 April 1937 p24</ref>

Black died at his home, The Rowans, 88 Holmfield Road, [[Leicester]] on 18 June 1951, aged 88 years. <ref>The Times, 5 July 1951 p8</ref>
