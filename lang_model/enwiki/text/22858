'''Roger Norreis''' (sometimes '''Roger Norreys'''<ref name=Monastic319/> or '''Roger Norris''';<ref name=DNB>Sayers "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/20283 Norreis, Roger (d. 1223)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> died between 1223 and 1225) was a medieval [[Abbot of Evesham]] in England. Norreis was a controversial figure, being appointed to a number of offices against opposition before his appointment to Evesham. At Evesham he was accused of immoral behavior and not obeying the monastic rules. He became embroiled in a dispute with both his monks and his episcopal superior, the [[Bishop of Worcester]] in 1202, with litigation and argumentation lasting until his deposition in 1213. He then was appointed [[prior]] of a subsidiary monastic house of Evesham, but was deposed within months before once more being appointed to the same office about five years later. He died sometime between 1223 and 1225.

==Background and early career==

Norreis was probably of Norse origins, as well as a native of northern England.<ref name=DNB/> He was a monk at [[Christ Church Priory]], the [[cathedral chapter]] of [[Canterbury Cathedral]].<ref name=Heads48>Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 48</ref> In 1187 he was appointed treasurer of the [[priory]].<ref name=Monastic332>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' p. 332</ref> Shortly before September 1187, [[Baldwin of Forde]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], tried to appoint Norreis as the [[cellarer]] of Christ Church, but the appointment was resisted by the monks, and in September they appealed to the papacy arguing that the appointment was against the [[Benedictine Rule]]. They also captured and held Norreis in custody while telling others that Norreis was sick. Norreis escaped in early 1188 by traveling through the sewer, and fled to the safety of the archbishop, who was then at [[Otford]]. As a mocking tribute to his escape route, Norreis was occasionally known as '''Roger Cloacarius''', or "Roger the Drain-Cleaner". Baldwin then tried to have Norreis installed as prior at Christ Church's [[Priory|dependent priory]] of [[St Martin's, Dover]].<ref name=DNB/>

==Prior and abbot==

In October 1189 Archbishop Baldwin appointed Norreis as prior of Christ Church itself, as part of his dispute with the priory over the foundation of a [[collegiate church]] at Hackington in honour of [[Thomas Becket]], which most of the monks of the priory opposed because they feared it would diminish the prestige of their priory. Norreis, unlike his fellow monks, had supported Baldwin in the dispute. But in November, King [[Henry II of England]] died and the cathedral chapter was able to secure a compromise which included the abandonment of the Hackington project and the dismissal of Norreis from office.<ref name=Monastic319>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 319<U+2013>322</ref> His fellow monks considered him a traitor to their cause and his reputation was that of someone with little morals. He was also known for ingratiating himself with those in power.<ref name=Monastic332/> Norreis was abbot when the [[crossing tower]] of the monastic church was completed.<ref name=Cox24>Cox "Evesham Abbey" ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'' p. 24</ref>

Norreis was appointed to the abbacy of [[Evesham Abbey]] in 1190, and was blessed as abbot 13 January 1190.<ref name=Heads48/> While abbot, he was accused of adultery, excessive drinking, gluttony, setting up favourites, starving the monks, and appropriating the monastic property for his own use.<ref name=Monastic333>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 333<U+2013>334</ref> A further offense was his habit of  wearing secular clothing rather than the monastic robes prescribed by the Benedictine Rule.<ref name=DNB/> All of these charges come from one of his monks, the historian [[Thomas of Marlborough]],<ref name=Law43>Boureau "How Law Came to the Monks" ''Past & Present'' p. 43</ref> who wrote much of the history of Evesham known as the ''[[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham]]''.<ref name=Law29>Boureau "How Law Came to the Monks" ''Past & Present'' p. 29</ref> Thomas' account of Norreis' rule is biased against the abbot<ref name=Law43/> and is a self-agrandizing account of how Thomas single-handedly triumphed over both his and his abbey's foes.<ref name=Law34/>

==Dispute with Mauger and the monks==

In 1202, the new [[Bishop of Worcester]], [[Mauger of Worcester|Mauger]], attempted to investigate Norreis' conduct, but under the leadership of Thomas of Marlborough, the monastic community refused to allow the bishop to visit, claiming that Evesham was exempt from [[Canonical visitation|episcopal visitation]] and oversight.<ref name=Monastic335/> According to Thomas, Norreis offered to make a renunciation of the abbey's claim to exemption, in return for money, but the bishop refused this offer. Norries then fled the monastery, while the monks continued to refuse the bishop and were excommunicated, a sentence that Norreis was spared.<ref name=Law45>Boureau "How Law Came to the Monks" ''Past & Present'' pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref>  The monks and Norreis then made common cause, each vowing to stand by the other in resisting the bishop.<ref name=DNB/> Besides these two disputes, there was a further dispute that became entangled with them between the monks and the bishop over ownership of some properties.<ref name=Law34>Boureau "How Law Came to the Monks" ''Past & Present'' pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref> 

In 1203 Norreis, secure in his alliance with his own monks, began again to exploit the monastery for his, his family, and his friends' profit. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas along with other monks to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King [[John of England|John]] and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis' exactions and abuse of his monks.<ref name=Law53>Boureau "How Law Came to the Monks" ''Past & Present'' pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref>   

Norreis went to Rome in the company of Thomas of Marlborough shortly before 1205 to lay the abbey's case before the papacy. Thomas remained in Italy, but Norreis returned to England in the middle of 1205.<ref name=Law34/> While in Rome, Norreis and Thomas borrowed 400 [[mark (money)|marks]] in order to finance the litigation at the papal curia.<ref name=Law52/>{{efn|100 [[livres]] of silver went to the pope and a further 100 livres to the cardinals.<ref name=Law52>Boureau "How Law Came to the Monks" ''Past & Present'' p. 52</ref>}}  The monks won a victory on the question of the abbey's exemption from episcopal visitation in 1206, but the other parts of the dispute were not decided.<ref name=Law34/> Later in 1206, the monks became so fed up with Norreis' abuse that they abandoned the abbey and did not return until they secured the abbot's confirmation of their rights.<ref name=Grandsen389>Grandsen "Separation of Portions" ''English Historical Review'' p. 389</ref>

The dispute between Norreis and his monks continued to drag on for a number of years, with the [[interdict]] of 1207<U+2013>1213 causing further delays, but in 1213, with the lifting of the interdict, the case against Norreis was finally heard and Norreis was deposed from the abbacy.<ref name=Monastic335>Knowles ''Monastic Order'' pp. 335<U+2013>342</ref> The monks, however, did not receive a definitive settlement of their case until 1269.<ref name=Law34/>

==Later life and death==

On 27 November 1213 he was appointed the prior of [[Penwortham Priory]], a dependent priory of Evesham, but was deposed 5 months later. In 1218 or 1219 he was restored to Penwortham.<ref name=Heads94>Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 94</ref> He died on 16 July,<ref name=Heads261/> or 19 July,<ref name=DNB/> but there is disagreement over the year of his death.<ref name=Heads261/><ref name=DNB/> The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' article on him states he died in 1223,<ref name=DNB/> but the editors of ''Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, 940<U+2013>1216'' state he died in either 1224 or 1225.<ref name=Heads261>Knowles, et al. ''Heads of Religious Houses'' p. 261</ref>
