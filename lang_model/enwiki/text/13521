'''Benjamin Harrison''' ([[August 20]] [[1833]] &ndash; [[March 13]] [[1901]]) was the twenty-third [[President of the United States]], serving one term from 1889 to 1893. Harrison was born in [[North Bend, Ohio]] and at age 21 moved to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], where he became a prominent state politician. During the [[American Civil War]] Harrison served as a [[Brigadier General]] in the [[XXI Corps (ACW)|XXI Corps]] of the [[Army of the Cumberland]]. After the war he unsuccessfully ran for the governorship of [[Indiana]], but was later elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. 

Harrison, a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], was elected to the presidency in 1888, defeating the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Grover Cleveland]]. He was the first, and to date only, president from the state of Indiana. His presidential administration is best known for its economic legislation, including the [[McKinley Tariff]] and the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], and for annual federal spending that reached one billion dollars for the first time. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] attacked the "Billion Dollar Congress", and used the issue to defeat the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], both in the [[United States House election, 1890|1890 mid-term elections]] and in Harrison's bid for reelection in 1892.

Harrison's wife died near the end of his presidential term. After failing to win reelection he returned to private life at his home in Indianapolis where he remarried, authored a book, and later represented the [[Republic of Venezuela]] in an international case against the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1900 he traveled to Europe as part of the case and, after a brief stay, returned to Indianapolis where he died the following year, from complications arising from [[influenza]].

==Early life==
===Family and education===
The [[Harrison family|Harrisons]] were among the [[First Families of Virginia]], with the arrival of an Englishman, also named Benjamin Harrison, at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1630.  The future president Benjamin was born on [[August 20]] [[1833]], in [[North Bend, Ohio|North Bend]], [[Hamilton County, Ohio]], as the second of eight children of [[John Scott Harrison]] (later a U.S. [[Congressman]] from [[Ohio]]) and Elizabeth Ramsey Irwin. Benjamin was a grandson of President [[William Henry Harrison]] and great-grandson of revolutionary leader and former Virginia governor [[Benjamin Harrison V]].<ref>Calhoun, pp. 7&ndash;8</ref><ref>Moore, p. 15</ref>

His early schooling took place in a one-room schoolhouse near his home. In 1845 he was provided with a tutor to help him with college preparatory studies. In 1847 he was enrolled in a newly built farmer's college called Gary's Academy, near [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], which he attended for two years.<ref>Moore, p. 19</ref> In 1850 Harrison transferred to [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]], where he was a member of the fraternity [[Phi Delta Theta]] and graduated in 1852.<ref>Moore, pp. 21&ndash;23</ref> Harrison attended Miami with [[John Alexander Anderson]],<ref name = c23>Calhoun, p. 23</ref> who would become a six term congressman, and [[Whitelaw Reid]], who would be Harrison's vice presidential candidate in his reelection campaign. While attending  Miami University, Harrison joined a [[Presbyterian]] church and, like his mother, he would remain a member for the rest his life.<ref>Wallace, p. 58</ref> After completing college Harrison took up the study of law in the Cincinnati law office of Storer & Gwynne, but before completing his law studies he returned to Oxford to marry.<ref>Calhoun, pp. 11&ndash;12, p. 23</ref>

On [[October 20]] [[1853]] Harrison, at the age of 20, married [[Caroline Lavinia Scott]], 21, in [[Oxford, Ohio]]. She was the daughter of the University's president, Rev. John W. Scott,<ref name = c23/> who performed the wedding ceremony.   The Harrisons had two children, Russell Benjamin Harrison ([[August 12]] [[1854]] - [[December 13]] [[1936]]) and Mary "Mamie" Scott Harrison McKee ([[April 3]] [[1858]] - [[October 28]] [[1930]]).<ref name = c2729>Calhoun, pp.  27 & 29</ref>

===Legal career===

After marriage, Harrison returned to live on his father's farm where he finished his law studies. That same year, he inherited $800 after the death of an aunt, using the money to move to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] in 1854.<ref>Calhoun, pp. 26</ref>  He was admitted to the bar there, and began practicing law in the office of John H. Ray. The same year he became a [[Town crier|crier]] for the Federal Court in Indianapolis, making $2.50 per day. He was responsible for passing through the streets and declaring announcements from the court.<ref name = c2729/>  He was made an honorary member of [[Delta Chi]], a legal professional fraternity at [[Michigan University]].<ref name="deltachi">{{Citation

While in Indianapolis, Benjamin Harrison was both the first President of the [[University Club]], a private [[gentlemen's club]], and the first President of the Phi Delta Theta Alumni Club of Indianapolis, the fraternity's first such club. Both clubs were still in existence in 2008.<ref>Calhoun, p. 22</ref> Harrison's grew up in a [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] household and was himself a supporter of Whig politics in his early life. He joined the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shortly after its formation in 1856 and that year campaigned on behalf of the Republican presidential candidate [[John C. Fremont]]. He won election to become Indianapolis City Attorney in the same election, a position that paid an annual salary of $400.<ref>Moore, p. 29</ref>

In 1858 Harrison entered into a law partnership, opening an office as Wallace & Harrison.<ref>Calhoun, p. 28</ref> Harrison was  Republican candidate for the position of [[Court reporter|reporter]] of the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] in 1860, his first foray into politics. Although this office was not political, he was an active supporter of his party's platform. During the election he debated [[Thomas Hendricks]], the Democratic candidate for governor and future [[Vice President of the United States]], on behalf of the Republican Party.<ref>Calhoun, p. 59</ref> After his law partner William Wallace was elected county clerk in 1860, Harrison opened a new firm with William Fishbank, named Fishback & Harrison, where he worked until his entry into the army.<ref>Calhoun, p. 33</ref>

===Civil War===
[[Image:GenBenHarrison.jpg|thumb|right|Brig. Gen. Benjamin Harrison]]

In 1862 [[United States President|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued a call for more recruits to join the [[Union Army]]. While visiting Governor [[Oliver Morton]], Harrison found him distressed over the shortage of men answering the latest call. Harrison is quoted as saying to the governor, "If I can be of any service, I will go".<ref>Wallace, p. 180</ref><ref>Calhoun, p. 34</ref> Morton then asked Harrison if he could help to recruit a regiment, though he would not ask him to serve. Harrison then proceeded to raise a regiment, by recruiting throughout northern Indiana. He was offered its command by Morton, but he declined because of his lack of military experience, and instead was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]]. In August 1862, when the regiment left Indiana to join the Union Army at [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Harrison was promoted by Morton to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]], and his regiment was commissioned as the 70th Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment.<ref>Wallace, pp. 180&ndash;181</ref><ref>Calhoun, pp. 21&ndash;23, p. 41, p. 44</ref>

The regiment first saw action in the [[Battle of Perryville]]. The unit performed reconnaissance duty and guarded railroads in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]], until [[William T. Sherman]]'s [[Atlanta Campaign]] in 1864. On [[January 2]], [[1864]], Harrison was promoted to command the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the XXI Army Corps. He commanded the [[Brigade]] at [[Battle of Resaca|Resaca]], [[Cassville, Georgia|Cassville]], [[Battle of New Hope Church|New Hope Church]], Lost Mountain, [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]], [[Battle of Marietta|Marietta]], [[Battle of Peachtree Creek|Peachtree Creek]] and [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]]. Harrison was later transferred to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] and participated in the [[Battle of Nashville|Siege of Nashville]].<ref name = c3644>Calhoun, pp. 36&ndash;44</ref><ref>Wallace, pp. 209&ndash;225</ref> On [[March 22]], [[1865]] Harrison was officially promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier General]] by [[Edwin M. Stanton]], the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], and marched in the [[Grand Review]] in [[Washington D.C.]] before finally mustering out of the army on June 8, 1865.<ref name = c3644/>

Some years after the war Harrison's public profile was raised when President [[Ulysses Simpson Grant|Grant]] appointed him to represent the US government in a civil claim brought by Lambdin Milligan, whose wartime conviction for treason had been reversed by the Supreme Court. Due to Harrison's advocacy, the damages awarded against the government were minimal.<ref>Wallace, pp. 93&mdash;94, p. 119</ref>

==Political career==
While in the army in October 1864, Harrison was reelected reporter of the Indiana State Supreme Court and served four more years. In 1872 he ran in the Republican [[primary election]] hoping win the nomination to run for governor. He was unable to get the support of former Governor Morton, who favored his opponent, and ultimately lost his bid.<ref>Moore, p. 28</ref> In 1876 Harrison again ran for the party's nomination for governor, and was successful. His campaign was based strongly on economic policy, and he was in favor of deflating the national currency. His policies proved popular with his base, but he was ultimately defeated by [[James D. Williams]], losing by 5,084 votes.<ref>Wallace, p. 266</ref><ref>Calhoun, pp. 32 & 58</ref> Harrison was appointed a member of the [[Mississippi River Commission]], in 1879. In 1880 he rose to national prominence as a delegate at the Republican National Convention, and the same year was elected to the [[United States Senate]]. After President [[James Garfield]]'s victory in 1880 Harrison was offered a cabinet position, which he declined in order to begin his term as senator.<ref>Calhoun, p. 60</ref>

Harrison served in the Senate from [[March 4]], [[1881]], to [[March 4]], [[1887]]. He was chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard|U.S. Senate Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard]] ([[Forty-seventh United States Congress|47th Congress]]) and [[United States Senate Committee on Territories|U.S. Senate Committee on Territories]] ([[Forty-eighth United States Congress|48th]] and [[Forty-ninth United States Congress|49th Congress]]es).<ref>Wallace, pp. 265&ndash;267</ref><ref>Calhoun, p. 59</ref> In 1887 was defeated in his bid for for reelection, the result being determined against him after a deadlock in the state senate.<ref>Moore, p. 66</ref>

==Presidency 1889&ndash;1893==
===Election of 1888===
[[Image:Harrison-inauguration.jpg|thumb|right|Inauguration of Benjamin Harrison, [[March 4]], [[1889]]]]
After eight rounds of voting at the [[Republican National Convention]], Harrison defeated [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] by 544 to 108 votes, winning the Republican presidential nomination.<ref>Wallace, p. 271</ref> Harrison was elected President of the United States in 1888 by means of [[Blocks of Five|notoriously fraudulent balloting]] in New York and Indiana.<ref name = c43>Calhoun, p. 43</ref>  In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|Presidential election]], Harrison received 90,000 fewer popular votes than incumbent President [[Grover Cleveland]], but carried the [[Electoral College]] 233 to 168.<ref>Calhoun, p. 4</ref>

Although he had made no political bargains, his supporters had given innumerable pledges upon his behalf. When Boss [[Matthew Quay]] of [[Pennsylvania]], rebuffed for a Cabinet position for his political support during the convention, heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to Providence, Quay exclaimed that Harrison would never know "how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him President."<ref>Calhoun, pp. 55, 60</ref>  He was inaugurated on [[March 4]] [[1889]], and served through [[March 4]] [[1893]]. Harrison was known as the "centennial president", because his inauguration celebrated the [[George Washington's legacy#Centennial celebration|centenary of the first inauguration]] of [[George Washington]] in 1789.<ref name = c4754> Calhoun, pp. 47-54</ref>

===Domestic policies===
[[Image:Harrison Football Political Cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Political football]]]]

Civil service reform was a prominent issue following Harrison's election. Congress was widely divided on the issue and Harrison was reluctant to address the issue in hope of preventing the alienation of either side. The issue became a popular [[political football]] of the time, and was immortalized in a cartoon captioned "What can I do when both parties insist on kicking?"<ref>Moore, pp. 83, 86</ref> Harrison appointed four Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. [[David Josiah Brewer]] in 1890, [[Henry Billings Brown]] in 1891, [[George Shiras, Jr.]] in 1892, and [[Howell Edmunds Jackson]] in 1893. Harrison also signed bills that admitted six states to the union. [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]] were admitted on November 2, 1889, Montana was admitted on November 8,  and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] on November 11. The following year two more states were added, [[Idaho]] on July 3 and [[Wyoming]] on July 10, 1890.

A major domestic problem Harrison faced was the [[tariff]] issue. The high tariff rates had created a surplus of money in the Treasury. Low-tariff advocates argued that the surplus was hurting business and angered many. Its repeal was one of the [[Ocala Demands]]. Representative [[William McKinley]] and Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] framed the [[McKinley Tariff]] that would raise the tariff even higher.<ref name = c1004>Calhoun, pp. 100&ndash;104</ref> Harrison attempted to make the tariff more acceptable by writing in [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]] provisions, but some rates remained intentionally prohibitive. To cope with the Treasury surplus, the tariff was removed from imported raw [[sugar]]; sugar growers within the United States were given two cents per pound bounty on their production.<ref name = c1004/> In an attempt to battle trusts and monopolies, Harrison signed into effect the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] in order to protect trade and commerce.  This was the first Federal act of its kind.<ref>Calhoun, pp. 92&ndash;93</ref>

===Foreign policy===

Harrison had an active foreign policy during his presidency. The first [[Pan-American Congress]] met in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1889, establishing an information center which later became the [[Organization of American States|Pan American Union]].<ref>Moore, p. 108</ref> At the end of his administration, Harrison submitted to the Senate a treaty to annex [[Hawaii]]; to his disappointment, President Cleveland later withdrew it.<ref>Calhoun, p. 132</ref><ref>Moore, p. 147</ref>

The first international crisis Harrison had to face occurred over the fishing rights on the [[Alaska]]n coast. [[Canada]] claimed fishing rights around many of the Aleutians islands and continued fishing there despite warning by the US Navy, leading to the navy seizing several Canadian ships. The Harrison administration initiated negotiations with the British that would lead to a compromise over the fishing right in the [[Bering Sea]].<ref>Moore, pp. 135&ndash;136</ref>

In early 1891 Harrison ordered the navy to prepare for war against [[Chile]] after receiving an "offensive" letter from the [[President of Chile]]. A diplomatic crisis arose, later called the [[Itata Incident]], fueled by the murder of a Chilean sailor by an American. Harrison gave a report to the Congress in the 1891 [[State of the Union Address]]. Ultimately the administration made peace overtures to the Chilean government after the "offensive" letter was withdrawn, and prosecution of the American murderer ensued.<ref>Moore, p. 134</ref>

===Reelection campaign===

Long before the end of the Harrison Administration, the treasury surplus had evaporated and prosperity seemed about to disappear.<ref>Calhoun, pp. 107, 126&ndash;127</ref> Congressional elections in 1890 went against the Republicans, several party leaders withdrew their support for President Harrison, although he had cooperated with Congress on party legislation, allowing him to bear the brunt of the public criticism. Nevertheless, his party renominated him in 1892 to run again for the presidency.<ref>Calhoun, p. 162</ref> Just two weeks earlier, on [[October 25]], [[1892]], Harrison's wife, Caroline died after a long battle with [[tuberculosis]]. Harrison did not actively campaign on his own behalf during his reelection bid and remained with his wife. Their daughter, [[Mary Harrison McKee]], continued the duties of the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] after her mother's death.<ref>Calhoun, p. 156</ref><ref>Moore, pp. 143&ndash;145</ref>

Harrison's opponent, Grover Cleveland, also did not actively campaign during the election <U+2014> the first time no candidate campaigned in a presidential election.<ref name = m146>Moore, p. 146</ref> Cleveland ultimately won the election with 227 electoral votes to Harrison's 145. Cleveland also won in the popular vote, 5,556,918 to 5,176,108. Harrison's defeat is attributed to the lack of popularity of the McKinley Tariff and the labor unrest in the western United States.<ref name = m146/>

==Post-presidency==
[[Image:Etc 405.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of President Harrison and his two wives in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]]]
After he left office, Harrison returned to Indianapolis.<ref>Moore, 150</ref>  He married a widow, [[Mary Scott Lord Dimmick]], on [[April 6]], [[1896]], in [[New York City]].  She was the niece of his deceased wife, and 25 years younger than Harrison.  His two adult children, Russell, 41 years old at the time, and Mary ("Mamie"), 38, did not attend the wedding because they disagreed with their father's marriage, which they viewed as inappropriate.  Their mother had died only three and a half years earlier.  Benjamin and Mary had one child, Elizabeth ([[February 21]], [[1897]] &ndash; [[December 26]], [[1955]]).<ref>Moore, 153</ref> Harrison went to the [[Hague Convention of 1899|First Peace Conference]] at [[The Hague]].  He served as an attorney for the Republic of [[Venezuela]] in the boundary dispute between Venezuela and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1900.<ref>Moore, 155</ref>  He also wrote a book entitled ''This Country of Ours'', about the federal government and the presidency, that was published in 1918 after his death.<ref>{{cite book|title=This Country of Ours|author=Benjamin Harrison|year=1918|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=InsAAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>

Harrison developed a heavy cold in February 1901. Despite treatment by steam vapor inhalation, his condition only worsened. He died from [[influenza]] and [[pneumonia]] on Wednesday, [[March 13]], [[1901]], aged 67. Harrison is interred in [[Crown Hill Cemetery]], which also holds the remains of three United States Vice-Presidents: [[Charles W. Fairbanks]], Thomas A. Hendricks, and [[Thomas R. Marshall]].<ref>Moore, 156</ref>

Benjamin Harrison is the earliest President whose voice is known to be preserved. This {{Audio|Benjamin Harrison speech.ogg| thirty-six second recording}} was originally made on a [[wax]] [[phonograph cylinder]] in 1889 by Giuseppe Bettini. [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] had been recorded for Edison earlier, but the [[tinfoil]] recording is presumed to be lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.msu.edu/vincent/presidents/harrison.htm|title=President Benjamin Harrison|publisher=Vincent Voice Library|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>Harrison had [[electricity]] installed in the White House for the first time by Edison Electric Company, but he and his wife reportedly would not touch the light switches for fear of [[electric shock|electrocution]] and would often go to sleep with the lights on.<ref>Moore, p. 96</ref> 

Harrison has had numerous institutions named in his honor, including the Benjamin Harrison Law School in Indianapolis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indylaw.indiana.edu/admissions/about.htm|title=About IU School of Law|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref>, a 1942 United States [[Liberty ship]] named the [[SS Benjamin Harrison|SS ''Benjamin Harrison'']],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coltoncompany.com/newsandcomment/news/2007/01.htm|title=Maritime News|publisher=Colton Company|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref> and a [[U.S. Army]] post, [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]], established in Indianapolis.
