'''Lana Crawford''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by [[Bridget Neval]]. The actress's casting was announced in June 2004, and she stated that she was excited to take on the role of Lana, a schoolgirl and the serial's first lesbian character. Neval explained that Lana's sexuality did not bother her, but she hoped her story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way. Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004.

Lana was a student, who had been closeted due to homophobic bullying at her high school. Upon moving to [[Erinsborough]], Lana befriended [[Serena Bishop]] ([[Lara Sacher]]) and her cousin [[Sky Mangel]] ([[Stephanie McIntosh]]), who she developed a crush on. The storyline between Lana and Sky was billed as a relationship story between two close female friends, "made compelling by the complexity of the feelings involved." Lana and Sky's friendship eventually culminated in ''Neighbours''' first lesbian kiss. 

The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in the serial's regular [[Censorship in Australia#Television|G-rated]] timselot and gave ''Neighbours'' a small increase in ratings. However, it led [[talk radio|talkback]] callers and conservative groups to attack the storyline and the characters. Writers for [[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com#AfterEllen.com|AfterEllen]] and the ''[[Sydney Star Observer]]'' branded the storyline "a real television advance" and praised Lana and her journey. The show's executive producer, Ric Pellizzeri, believed the storyline reflected reality and some viewers said that it had had a "profound effect" on them.

Neval later explained "My initial reaction to the part was surprise as ''Neighbours'' have never had a gay character. But the nature of the character never really bothered me. My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way.

==Storylines==
Lana is [[Sindi Watts|Sindi]] ([[Marisa Warrington]]) and [[Penny Watts]]' ([[Andrea McEwan]]) cousin. She was born in Australia, but her family moved to Canada when she was young. They returned to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This led her to transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced that she had seen Serena before, and she realises that Serena had been in some photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also been taken in by Chris and that she was not over it. Lana did not get on with Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school. [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) places them in detention and urges them to work things out. 

Sky and Lana start to trust each other a little, and during a sleepover organised by Serena, they discover that they both like black and white films. They bond, and Lana later watches Sky fall asleep. Sky realises that Lana has hidden depths and tells her. Lana gets upset and tells Sky that she is not hiding anything. Sky calls a friend who attended Wattle Heights High with Lana and finds out about the bullying that caused Lana to change schools. During a playfight at a sleepover, Lana suddenly kisses Sky. She runs out of the house and goes to the Coffee Shop, where she finds Sindi. Lana reveals to Sindi that she is gay. Lana admits that she does not want to lose Sky as a friend and tries to pass the kiss off as a joke. Sky tells [[Boyd Hoyland]] ([[Kyal Marsh]]) about the kiss, and Lana is later outed at school. 

Lana attempts to convince everyone that it is just a rumour by dating [[Brendan Bond]] (Michael Wahr). When Sky finds out that Lana is planning to have sex with Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called ''Freak Girl and The Enigma'' and [[Buffy Only]] (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are not right for each other.  

Sky and Lana decide to plant lavender outside Lassiter's Hotel, and they stay to watch everyone's reactions. During her excitement, Sky kisses Lana, who is delighted as she believes Sky has fallen for her. Sky explains to Lana that they can only be friends, and Lana accuses Sky of using her. Lana avoids Sky for several days, but they eventually make up. Lana finds a note in her locker from someone named George, asking her to the end-of-year formal dance. During the formal, "George" introduces herself as [[Georgina Harris]] (Adrienne Smith), and she and Lana spend the rest of the night together. Lana decides to return to Canada, and her friends throw her a farewell party. Sky tells Lana that she will miss her and gives her a pen, so she can start writing her own novel. Lana says goodbye to George, and Lana's friends watch as Lana leaves Ramsay Street in a taxi.

==Reception==
[[File:Marisa Warrington Small.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Marisa Warrington]]'s character, [[Sindi Watts]], was praised for her positive reaction to Lana's coming out.]]
Shortly after the episode featuring the kiss was aired, the characters were attacked by talkback callers and conservative groups who thought that they had been "glamorising a high-risk culture" and "making homosexuality look cool".<ref name="Nguyen"/> Chief executive of the Christian group Salt Shakers, Peter Stokes, told ''[[The Age]]'s'' Kenneth Nguyen, "It just saddens me that we give our young people the message that these relationships are OK."<ref name="Nguyen"/> However, Ray Misson, the head of Melbourne University's arts education department, described the serial's depiction of a lesbian as "a real advance."<ref name="Nguyen"/> Neval believed that gay teenagers, who were already feeling insecure about how their sexuality would be accepted, would be devastated by the negative reaction surrounding the storyline.<ref name="Nguyen"/>

On the reaction the kiss between Lana and Sky received, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated, "From the amount of backlash this kiss generated in Australia, you'd think that they'd shown a full blown love scene; newspapers have been full of angry letters to the editor decrying the gay storyline. The negative reaction by many in the Australia press mirrors Lana's current storyline on ''Neighbours'', which explores the backlash Lana experiences when her sexuality becomes public knowledge at her high school."<ref name="NNorton"/> Norton's colleague, Malinda Lo, later said that many of the website's readers said Lana's storyline had a "profound effect" on them when they were teenagers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/blwe/08-29-08?page=0%2C1|title=Best.

Bill Muehlenberg from [[Australian Family Association]] believed Lana's introduction and storyline was just an attempt to increase ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-120923755.html|title=Ramsay St gets a new gay neighbour|last=Devlyn|first=Darren|date=19 August 2004|work=[[Australasian Business Intelligence]]|publisher=[[LexisNexis]]|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref> A ''Sydney Star Observer'' reporter praised Lana's cousin, Sindi, for being sympathetic and reacting in a positive way when Lana came out to her.<ref name="Sydney"/> The reporter also praised Sky's reaction for being "more let's talk about it than get away from me, you lezzo freak", while adding that it seemed ''Neighbours'' had wanted Lana to be a "sympathetic gay character", which must have upset the Christian groups.<ref name="Sydney"/> Of Lana's storyline, a writer for AfterEllen stated, "The significance of this depiction was that it occurred in a relatively conservative, family-oriented show with a large child viewership, and all the major sympathetic characters were presented as supportive of Lana's sexuality, with the bullies being depicted as villains."<ref name="Queer"/> 

In his book ''Neighbours: 20 years of Ramsay Street'', Tony Johnston wrote, "Vilified by ultra-conservative groups and celebrated by the gay press, the kiss helped to redefine ''Neighbours'' as it entered its third decade."<ref>[[#refjohnston|Johnston 2005]], p.75.</ref> In July 2007, the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' asked readers to vote for their top ten ''Neighbours'' moments.<ref name="Moments">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archives/old-news-pages/your-all-time-favourite-moment/story-e6frf99f-1111113933908|title=Your all-time favourite moment|date=11 July 2007|work=[[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]]|accessdate=11 June 2010}}</ref> Lana and Sky's kiss came in at number nine, and a reporter for the paper said "It's rare that ''Neighbours'' attracts the attention of the shock jocks around the country, but that's what happened when Sky Bishop, played by Stephanie McIntosh, gave Lana, played by Bridget Neval, a kiss. Sky was exploring her sexuality and the scene was one of the most talked about ever in the press. Lana left Erinsborough and Sky has gone on to be an unmarried mum".<ref name="Moments"/>
