===Background===
Outside of the weekly [[Extreme Championship Wrestling (WWE)#ECW on Sci Fi|''ECW'']] broadcast, the pay-per-view received very little hype on either ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' or ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'', with WWE concentrating more on the [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series]] pay-per-view that aired one week earlier. At this time, the main [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] on the Raw brand was [[D-Generation X]] versus [[Rated-RKO]],<ref name="Nov 20 2006 RAW Results">{{cite web|first=Zack|last=Zeigler|title=Breaking Down in Baltimore|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/11202006/|publisher= WWE|date=2006-11-20|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> and the main feud on the SmackDown! brand was [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] versus [[Booker Huffman|King Booker]].<ref name="Nov 24 2006 SD!

After a back and forth match, which lasted over twenty minutes, MNM performed the [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Flapjack DDT|Snapshot]] on Jeff and looked set to win. Matt, however, broke the [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] and performed a [[Neckbreaker|double neckbreaker]] on MNM.

Rumors evolved stating that WWE viewed Sabu as being "useless" in normal matches and that he could only perform in matches that included "stunts and tables and they [WWE] don't respect him because of that."

In the second tag-team match of the night, Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay defeated [[Full Blooded Italians|F.B.I.]] members Little Guido Maritato and Tony Mamaluke.

A [[Tag team|Mixed Tag Team match]] followed as Kevin Thorn and [[Shelly Martinez|Ariel]] faced Mike Knox and [[Barbie Blank|Kelly Kelly]]. Before the match began, Kelly Kelly was shown wishing CM Punk luck for the main event. The finish of the match came when Knox walked out on Kelly Kelly, leaving her on her own in the ring. Ariel performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Legsweep|legsweep]] on Kelly Kelly for the pinfall.<ref name="D2D WrestleView Report"/> Ariel and Thorn attacked Kelly Kelly after the match, but [[Jim Fullington|The Sandman]] appeared and hit Thorn repeatedly with his [[Shinai|Singapore cane]].<ref name="SLAM!

[[Image:Elimination chamber nyr06.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A picture of the [[Elimination Chamber]].]]
The final match was the Extreme Elimination Chamber main event for the ECW World Championship. Before it began, Paul Heyman came out to the ring and explained how the match would work and said that there was a weapon in each of the four different pods that housed the wrestlers.<ref name="D2D WrestleView Report"/> In a conversation with The Big Show before he made his way to the ring, he revealed that for the first-time in his professional career he was not motivated to give the promo.<ref name=hardcorehistory-pp258/> Rob Van Dam and Hardcore Holly started off the match, with one of the other four competitors entering every five minutes afterwards. The first person to be released from his pod was CM Punk, who entered the match with a steel chair in hand. Test came out five minutes after Punk with a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]]. Punk was the first person eliminated from the match when Van Dam performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Five-Star Frog splash]]. Moments later, Test hit Holly with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|big boot]] and then pinned him. Van Dam was the third person eliminated after Test, standing on The Big Show's pod, performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|diving elbow drop]] with a steel chair. When Lashley's pod was supposed to open, he could not get out of it because Heyman's Security had bolted the pod shut. Lashley used the table that was with him to smash the pod open, allowing him to get out. Lashley then hit Test with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#spear|spear]] to get a pinfall. The Big Show was the final man to exit his pod and enter the match, with a [[baseball bat]] wrapped in [[barbed wire]]. Lashley blocked The Big Show's swing of the bat with a steel chair and then threw The Big Show into a pod, causing him to bleed. Lashley managed to turn an attempted [[chokeslam]] from The Big Show into a DDT and then speared The Big Show to win the match and become new ECW World Champion.<ref name="D2D Main Event"/><ref name="D2D WrestleView Report"/>

Not long after December to Dismember, The Big Show was offered a long-term contract extension by WWE, reported to be around [[United States dollar|$]]1 million a year. He turned it down, however, because he was burned out and hurting physically.<ref name="SLAM!

Critics and fans had a negative reaction to the pay-per-view,<ref name="Review 1">{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Anderson|title=ECW December to Dismember - REVIEWED |url=http://www.thewrestlingblog.com/2006/12/05/ecw-december-to-dismember-reviewed/|publisher =The Wrestling Blog|date=2006-12-05|accessdate=2007-10-14|quote=I would stop short of calling it the worst pay-per-view of all time, but it<U+2019>s certainly among the worst.
