'''Antarctica''' is the southernmost continent and encompasses the [[South Pole]].  Antarctica is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]] and divided by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. On average, it is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents.<ref>{{cite web | title=National Geophysical Data Center | publisher=National Satellite, Data, and Information Service| url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/2minrelief.html | accessdate=9 June | accessyear=2006}}</ref> At 14.425 million&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, Antarctica is the third-smallest continent after [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]] and 98% of it is covered in [[ice]]. Because there is little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], except at the coasts, the interior of the continent is technically the largest [[desert]] in the world. There are no permanent human residents and Antarctica has never had an indigenous population. Only cold-adapted plants and animals survive there, including [[penguin]]s, [[fur seals]], [[moss]]es, [[lichen]]s, and many types of [[algae]]. The name "Antarctica" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''<U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>'' (''antarktikos''), meaning "opposite the [[Arctic]]." <ref>{{cite web | author=[[Henry Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott|Scott, Robert]] | work=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] | publisher=Clarendon Press | title={{polytonic|<U+1F00><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>}} | year=1940 | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=%239514 | accessdate=12 February | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, the first confirmed sighting of the continent is commonly accepted to have occurred in 1820 by the [[Russia]]n expedition of [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev|Mikhail Lazarev]] and [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]]. However, the continent remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of resources, and isolated location.

The [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]] was signed in 1959 by 12 countries. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists of many nationalities and with different research interests. <ref>https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html#People</ref>

{{main|History of Antarctica}}
Belief in the existence of a ''Terra Australis'' <U+2014> a vast continent located in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of Europe, Asia and north Africa <U+2014> had existed since [[Ptolemy]] suggested the idea in order to preserve [[symmetry]] of [[landmass]] in the world. Depictions of a large southern landmass were common in maps such as the early 16th century Turkish [[Piri Reis map]]. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of "Antarctica," geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.

European maps continued to show this land until [[Captain]] [[James Cook]]'s ships, ''[[HMS Resolution (Cook)|Resolution]]'' and ''[[HMS Adventure (1771)|Adventure]]'', crossed the [[Antarctic Circle]] on [[January 17]], [[1773]] and again in 1774.<ref>{{cite web | author=The Mariners' Museum | title=Age of Exploration: John Cook | url=http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php | accessdate=12 February | accessyear=2006}}</ref> The first confirmed sighting of Antarctica can be narrowed down to the crews of ships captained by two individuals. According to various organizations (the [[National Science Foundation]],<ref>{{cite web | author=U.S. Antarctic Program External Panel of the [[National Science Foundation]] | title=Antarctica&mdash;Past and Present | url=http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/1997/antpanel/antpan05.pdf | accessdate=6 February | accessyear=2006}}</ref> [[NASA]],<ref>NASA, U.S. Government [http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica/background/NSF/palmer.html Palmer biography] Retrieved [[February 6]] [[2006]].</ref> the [[University of California, San Diego]],<ref>University of California, San Diego [http://arcane.ucsd.edu/pstat.html Palmer Station] Retrieved [[February 5]] [[2006]].</ref> and other sources<ref>South-Pole [http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm An Antarctic Time Line : 1519 - 1959].

Von Bellingshausen supposedly saw Antarctica on [[January 27]], [[1820]], three days before Bransfield sighted land, and ten months before Palmer did so in November 1820. On that day the two ship expedition led by Von Bellingshausen and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev]] reached a point within 32&nbsp;km (20&nbsp;miles) of the Antarctic mainland and saw ice fields there.

In 1841, explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]]. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. [[Mount Erebus]] and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] are named after two ships from his expedition: ''[[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS Erebus]]'' and ''[[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS Terror]]''.<ref>[http://www.south-pole.com/p0000081.htm James Clark Ross] South-Pole - Exploring Antarctica.

Most of Antarctica is located south of the [[Antarctic Circle]], surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]. It is the southernmost [[land mass]] and comprises more than 14 million&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, making it the fifth-largest continent. The coastline measures 17&nbsp;968&nbsp;km (11,160&nbsp;miles) and is mostly characterized by ice formations, as the following table shows:

Physically, it is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the [[Ross Sea]] and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called [[West Antarctica|Western Antarctica]] and the remainder [[Eastern Antarctica]], because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]]. The [[ice sheet]] is, on average, 2.5&nbsp;kilometers (1.6&nbsp;miles) thick. The continent has approximately 90% of the world's [[fresh water]], in the form of ice.<ref name="cia">Central Intelligence Agency [https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ay.html Factbook] Retrieved [[February 6]] [[2006]].</ref> In most of the interior of the continent [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to 20 mm/yr; in a few "[[blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[Sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] and so the local mass balance is negative. In the dry valleys the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape. 

Western Antarctica is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several meters in a relatively [[geological timescale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]].

Although Antarctica is home to many volcanoes, only [[Deception Island]] and [[Mt. Erebus]] are active. Mount Erebus, located in [[Ross Island]], is the southernmost active volcano.

Antarctica is home to more than 70 [[lake]]s that lie thousands of meters under the surface of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath [[Russia]]'s [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It is believed that the lake has been sealed off for 35 million years. There is some evidence that Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]]. The sealed, frozen surface of the lake shares similarities with [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. Confirming that life can survive in Lake Vostok strengthens the argument for life on the satellite.<ref>National Science Foundation [http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/fslakevostok.htm Lake Vostok] Retrieved [[February 6]] [[2006]].</ref><ref>NASA [http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/stories/europa_vostok_0899.html Lake Vostok may teach us about Europa] Retrieved [[February 4]] [[2006]].</ref>

==Geology==
===Geological history and paleontology===
More than 170 million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time Gondwana broke apart and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago.

====Paleozoic era (540-250 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]])====
[[Image:Survey-Route.jpg|210px|thumb|right|Survey route.]]
During the Cambrian period Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the northern hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea-floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the Devonian period (416 Mya) Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360 Mya) as Gondwana became centered around the [[South Pole]] and the climate cooled, though flora remained. During the Permian period the plant life became dominated by fern-like plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.<ref name="Stonehouse">{{cite book | editor = Stonehouse, B. (ed.) | title = Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans | year = 2002 | month = June | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | id = ISBN 0-471-98665-8}}</ref>

====Mesozoic era (250-65 Mya)====
[[Image:Bransfield-Strait.jpg|210px|thumb|left|Bransfield Strait.]]
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In East Antarctica the [[seed fern]] became established, and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the Jurassic period (206-146 Mya), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period, as were reptiles such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. In West Antarctica [[conifer]] [[forest]]s dominated through the entire Cretaceous period (146-65 Mya), though [[Nothofagus|Southern beech]] began to take over at the end of this period. [[Ammonite]]s were common in the seas around Antarctica, and dinosaurs were also present, though only two Antarctic dinosaur species (''[[Cryolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Antarctopelta]]'') have been described to date. It was during this period that Gondwana began to break up.

====Gondwana breakup (160-23 Mya)====
[[Africa]] separated from Antarctica around 160 Mya, followed by [[India]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Mya). About 65 Mya, Antarctica (then connected to [[Australia]]) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with a [[marsupial]] fauna. About 40 Mya [[Australia]]-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica and the first ice began to appear. Around 23 Mya, the [[Drake Passage]] between Antarctica and [[South America]] resulted in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]]. The ice spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent. Since about 15 Mya, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.<ref name="Trewby">{{cite book | editor = Trewby, Mary (ed.) | title = Antarctica: An Encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton | year = 2002 | month = September | publisher = Firefly Books | id = ISBN 1-55297-590-8}}</ref>

===Geology of present-day Antarctica===
[[Image:AntarcticaRockSurface.jpg|thumb|250px|Antarctica without its ice-shield. This map does not consider that sea level would rise because of the melted ice, nor that the landmass would rise by several hundred meters over a few tens of thousands of years after the weight of the ice was no longer depressing the landmass.]]
The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by the fact that nearly all of the continent is permanently covered with a thick layer of ice. However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] of [[South America]].<ref name="Stonehouse" /> The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea-bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic Period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to the eastern part of the continent.

East Antarctica is geologically very old, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are various more modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s, coal and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[Geologic fault|faulting]] has occurred.

The main [[mineral]] resource known on the continent is [[coal]].<ref name="Trewby" /> It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of [[iron ore]]. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the [[Ross Sea]] in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is banned until 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Antarctica}}

[[Image:Lake_Fryxell.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Blue ice (glacial)|Blue ice]] covering [[Lake Fryxell]], in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]], comes from [[glacier|glacial]] meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]] and other smaller glaciers.]]
Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. It is a frozen desert with little [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]; the South Pole itself receives almost none. Temperatures reach a minimum of between -121 <U+00B0>F and -130 <U+00B0>F (-85 <U+00B0>C and -90 <U+00B0>C) in the winter and about 30 degrees Fahrenheit (20 <U+00B0>C) higher in the summer months. Sunburn is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects over 90% of the sunlight falling on it.<ref name="weather">British Antarctic Survey. [http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm ''Weather in the Antarctic''] Retrieved [[February 9]] [[2006]].</ref> Eastern Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the center cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, [[ice]] there lasts for extended time periods. Heavy snowfalls are not uncommon on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22&nbsp;meters (48&nbsp;inches) in 48&nbsp;hours have been recorded. [[Image:Friesland-St-Boris.jpg|210px|thumb|right|Mountain glaciation.]] At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, however, wind speeds are typically moderate. During summer more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at the [[equator]] in an equivalent period.<ref name="cia" />

Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for two reasons. First, much of the continent is more than 3&nbsp;km above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. Second, the [[Arctic Ocean]] covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica.

Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world. The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].<ref name="weather" />

[[Image:iceberg09.jpg|500px|thumb|center|Tabletop [[iceberg]]s in Antarctica.]]

==Population==
{{seealso|Demographics of Antarctica}}
Although Antarctica has no permanent residents, a number of governments maintain permanent [[research station]]s throughout the continent. The population of people doing and supporting science on the continent and its nearby islands varies from approximately 4000 in summer to 1000 in winter. Many of the stations are staffed around the year.

[[Image:Antarctic_researchers.jpg|thumb|left|Two American researchers studying [[plankton]] through [[microscope]]s.]]
The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were English and American sealers who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1000 in the summer (over 2000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of [[Grytviken]], Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who adopted British citizenship in 1910, and his family.

[[Image:Fieldwork-Melnik.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Field work.]]The first child born in the southern polar region was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbj<U+00F6>rg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on [[8 October]] [[1913]], and her birth registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and of Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 to become the manager of [[Grytviken]], serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island<ref>R.K. Headland, The Island of South Georgia, Cambridge University Press, 1984.</ref>.

[[Emilio Marcos Palma]] was the first person born on the Antarctic mainland, at [[Esperanza Base|Base Esperanza]] in 1978, his parents being sent there along with seven other families by the [[Argentina|Argentinean]] government to determine if family life was suitable in the continent. In 1986, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station.<ref>''The Antarctic Sun'' [http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/oldissues2002-2003/answer.html Questions and answers] Retrieved [[February 9]] [[2006]].</ref>

==Flora and fauna==
{{seealso|Antarctic ecozone}}
===Flora===
[[Image:Lichen_squamulose.jpg|thumb|right|More than 200 species of [[lichen]]s are known in Antarctica.]]
{{main|Antarctic flora}}
The climate of Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit the flourishing of plants. As a result, plant life is limited to mostly [[moss]]es and [[liverwort]]s. The [[autotroph]]ic community is made up of mostly [[protist]]s. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[lichen]]s, [[bryophyte]]s, [[algae]], and [[fungi]]. Growth generally occurs in the summer, and only for a few weeks at most.

There are more than 200 species of lichens and approximately 50 species of bryophytes, such as mosses. Seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are [[phytoplankton]]. Multicolored [[snow algae]] and [[diatoms]] are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer. There are two species of flowering plants found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass) and ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort).<ref>Australian Antarctic Division [http://www.aad.gov.au/default.asp?casid=5551 Antarctic Wildlife] Retrieved [[February 5]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Fauna===
Land [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] is nearly completely [[invertebrate]]. Invertebrate life includes [[microscopic]] [[mite]]s, [[lice]], [[Roundworm|nematode]]s, [[tardigrades]], [[rotifers]], and [[springtail]]s. The [[midge (insect)|midge]], just 12 [[millimeter|mm]] in size, is the largest land animal in Antarctica (other than humans). The [[Snow Petrel]] is one of only three birds that breed exclusively in Antarctica and have been seen at the [[South Pole]].

[[Image:Emperor_penguin.jpg|thumb|165px|[[Emperor Penguin]]s in [[Ross Sea]], Antarctica.]]

A variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whales]], and [[fur seal]]s. The [[Emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adelie Penguin|Ad<U+00E9>lie Penguin]] breeds further south than any other penguin. The [[Rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[Chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[Gentoo Penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic. 

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell Seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of [[United Kingdom|British]] sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregates in large [[swarm|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.<ref>[http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm Creatures of Antarctica] Retrieved [[February 6]] [[2006]].</ref>

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] brought several restrictions to the continent. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.<ref name="cia" /> Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]], remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&nbsp;tonnes in 2000.<ref>BBC News.

==Politics==
[[Image:Logistic-Support.jpg|210px|thumb|left|Resupply by the Uruguayan Navy vessel 'Vanguardia'.]]
As the only uninhabited continent, Antarctica has no government and belongs to no country. Various countries claim areas of it but these claims are typically not recognized by others. The area between 90<U+00B0>W and 150<U+00B0>W is the only part of Antarctica, indeed the only solid land on Earth, not claimed by any country.<ref name="cia" /> 

Since 1959, claims on Antarctica have been suspended and the continent is considered politically neutral. Its status is regulated by the 1959 [[Antarctic Treaty]] and other related agreements, collectively called the [[Antarctic Treaty System]]. For the purposes of the Treaty System, Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60<U+00B0>S. The treaty was signed by 12 countries, including the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation, environmental protection, and banned military activity on that continent. This was the first [[arms control]] agreement established during the [[Cold War]].

The Antarctic Treaty prohibits any military activity in Antarctica, such as the establishment of military bases and fortifications, the carrying out of military manoeuvres, or the testing of any type of weapon. Military personnel or equipment are only permitted for scientific research or for other peaceful purposes.<ref>Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research. [http://www.scar.org/treaty/ ''Antarctic Treaty''] Retrieved [[February 9]] [[2006]].</ref> The only documented large-scale land military maneuver was [[Operaci<U+00F3>n 90|Operation NINETY]], undertaken ten years before the Antarctic Treaty by the [[Military of Argentina|Argentine military]].<ref>Antarctica Institute of Argentina. [http://www.dna.gov.ar/INGLES/DIVULGAC/ARGANT.HTM ''Argentina in Antarctica''] Retrieved [[February 9]] [[2006]].</ref>

The [[United States military]] issues the [[Antarctica Service Medal]] to military members or civilians who perform research duty on the Antarctica continent. The medal includes a "wintered over" bar issued to those who remain on the continent for two complete six-month seasons.<ref>U.S. Navy [http://www.history.navy.mil/medals/antarc.htm Antarctic Service Medal] Retrieved [[February 9]] [[2006]].</ref>Unlike other world powers, the United States has made no territorial claim in Antarctica nor does it recognize the claims of any other state.<ref>United States [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html CIA World Factbook] Retrieved [[July 2]] [[2006]].</ref>

The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap. [[Australia]] has the greatest claim of Antarctic territory.

[[Germany]] also maintained a claim to Antarctica, known as [[New Swabia]], between 1939 and 1945. It was situated from {{coor d Antarctic|20|E}} to {{coor d Antarctic|10|W}}, overlapping Norway's claim.

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Antarctica}}
[[Image:Antarctic_cod.jpg|thumb|left|The illegal capture and sale of the [[Patagonian toothfish]] has led to several arrests. Pictured here is the [[Antarctic toothfish]], a sister species.]]

Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they exist in quantities too small to exploit. The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998 a compromise agreement was reached to add a 50-year ban on mining until the year 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary agricultural activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000-01 reported landing 112,934&nbsp;tonnes.<ref name="cia">Santa Barbara City College Biological Sciences [http://www.biosbcc.net/ocean/AAimportance.htm Importance of Antarctica] Retrieved [[February 5]] [[2006]].</ref>

Small-scale [[tourism]] has existed since 1957 and is currently self-regulated by [[International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators]] (IAATO). However, not all vessels have joined the IAATO. Several [[ship]]s transport people into Antarctica for specific scenic locations. A total of 27,950 tourists visited in the 2004-05 Antarctic summer with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships. The number is predicted to increase to over 80,000 by 2010.<ref>International association of Antarctica Tour Operators. [http://www.iaato.org/tourism_stats.html Tourism Statistics].

A currency, the [[Antarctican dollar]], has been proposed by a US company, and may be accepted at parity with the [[United States dollar]].

==Research==

{{seealso|List of research stations in Antarctica}}

Each year, scientists from 27 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to nearly 1000 in the winter.<ref name="cia" /> The [[McMurdo Station]] is capable of housing more than 1000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. [[Geologist]]s tend to study plate tectonics in the Arctic region, meteorites from the [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]]. [[Glaciologist]]s in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating [[ice]], [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. [[Biologist]]s, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. [[Astrophysicist]]s in [[Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station]] are able to study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] because of the ozone hole and the location's dry, cold environment. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built 2&nbsp;km below Amundsen-Scott station.<ref>Antarctic Connection [http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml Science in Antarctica] Retrieved [[February 4]] [[2006]].</ref>

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985 3 British Scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley]] Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. In 1998 [[NASA]] satellite data showed that the Antarctic [[ozone hole]] was the largest on record, covering 27&nbsp;million square kilometers. In 2002 significant areas of ice shelves disintegrated in response to regional warming.<ref name="cia" />

===Meteorites===
[[Image:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]].]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorites found in Antarctica were in 1912. In 1969 the Japanese discovered nine meteorites in Antarctica. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the [[ice sheet]] in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are relatively well preserved.<ref name="meteorite">NASA [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm Meteorites from Antarctica] Retrieved [[February 9]] [[2006]].</ref>

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these meteorites are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the center of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.<ref name="meteorite" />

In 2006 a team of researchers from [[Ohio State University]] used gravity measurements by NASA's [[GRACE]] satellites to discover the 300-mile-wide [[Wilkes Land crater]], which probably formed about 250 million years ago.<ref name="crater">{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica -- Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| year=June 1, 2006}}</ref>
