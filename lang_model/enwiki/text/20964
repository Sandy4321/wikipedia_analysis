'''Pauline Elisabeth Ottilie Luise zu Wied''' (29 December 1843 <U+2013> 3 March/2 November 1916) was the [[List of Romanian consorts|Queen consort of Romania]] as the wife of King [[Carol I of Romania]], widely known by her literary name of ''Carmen Sylva''.

==Family and early life==
Born at "Schloss Monrepos" in [[Neuwied]], she was the daughter of [[Hermann, Prince of Wied]], and his wife [[Princess Marie of Nassau]], daughter of [[William, Duke of Nassau]] (and sister of [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]). Elisabeth had artistic leanings; her childhood featured seances and visits to the local lunatic asylum.<ref name=P144/>

==Marriage==
As a young girl, sixteen-year old Elisabeth was considered as a possible bride for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], known as Bertie). His mother [[Queen Victoria]] strongly favored her as a prospective [[daughter-in-law]], and urged her daughter [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Vicky]] to look further into her.<ref name=P144>Pakula, p. 144.</ref> Elisabeth was spending the social season at the Berlin court, where her family hoped she would be tamed into a docile, marriageable princess. Vicky responded, "I do not think her at all distingu<U+00E9>e looking - certainly the opposite to Bertie's usual taste", whereas the tall and slender [[Alexandra of Denmark]] was "just the style Bertie admires".<ref name=P144/> Bertie was also shown photographs of Elisabeth, but professed himself unmoved and declined to give them a second glance.<ref>Hibbert, pp. 40-41.</ref> In the end, Alexandra was chosen for Bertie.

She first met the future King of [[Romania]] at [[Berlin]] in 1861, and was married to him on 15 November 1869 in [[Neuwied]]. Their only child, a daughter, [[Princess Maria of Romania (1870<U+2013>1874)|Maria]], died in 1874 at age three.

In the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877-1878|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877-1878 she devoted herself to the care of the wounded, and founded the [[Order of Elizabeth]] (a gold cross on a blue ribbon) to reward distinguished service in such work. She fostered the higher education of women in Romania, and established societies for various charitable objects.

Early distinguished by her excellence as a pianist, organist and singer, she also showed considerable ability in painting and illuminating; but a lively poetic imagination led her to the path of literature, and more especially to poetry, folk-lore and ballads. In addition to numerous original works she put into literary form many of the legends current among the Romanian peasantry.

She was the 835th [[Dame_(title)|Dame]] of the Royal Order of Queen Maria Luisa.  She died at [[Curtea de Arge<U+015F>]] or [[Bucharest]].

== Literary activity ==
As "Carmen Sylva", she wrote with facility in [[German language|German]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]. A few of her voluminous writings, which include poems, plays, novels, short stories, essays, collections of aphorisms, etc., may be singled out for special mention:
{{House of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen}}
*Her earliest publications were "Sappho" and "Hammerstein", two poems which appeared at [[Leipzig]] in 1880.
*In 1888 she received the [[Prix Botta]], a prize awarded triennially by the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]], for her volume of prose aphorisms ''Les Pensees d'une reine'' ([[Paris]], 1882), a German version of which is entitled ''Vom Amboss'' (Bonn, 1890).
*''Cuvinte Sufletesci'', religious meditations in Romanian ([[Bucharest]], 1888), was also translated into German (Bonn, 1890), under the name of ''Seelen-Gespr<U+00E4>che''.

Several of the works of "Carmen Sylva" were written in collaboration with [[Mite Kremnitz]], one of her maids of honor, who was born at Greifs-wald in 1857, and married Dr Kremnitz of Bucharest; these were published between 1881 and 1888, in some cases under the pseudonyms Dito et Idem. These include:
* ''Aus zwei Welten'' (Leipzig, 1884), a novel
* ''[[Anna Boleyn]]'' (Bonn, 1886), a tragedy
* ''In der Irre'' (Bonn, 1888), a collection of short stories
* ''Edleen Vaughan'', or ''Paths of Peril'' (London, 1894), a novel
* ''Sweet Hours'' (London, 1904), poems, written in English.

Among the translations made by "Carmen Sylva" are:
* German versions of Pierre Loti's romance ''Pecheur d'Islande''
* German versions of Paul de St Victor's dramatic criticisms ''Les Deux Masques'' (Paris, 1881<U+2013>1884)
* and especially ''The Bard of the Dimbovitza'', an English translation of [[Elena V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]]'s collection of Romanian folk-songs, etc., entitled ''Lieder aus dem Dimbovitzathal'' (Bonn, 1889), translated by "Carmen Sylva" and Alma Strettell.

The Bard of the Dimbovitza was first published in 1891, and was soon reissued and expanded. Translations from the original works of "Carmen Sylva" have appeared in all the principal languages of Europe and in [[Armenian language|Armenian]].

== The V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu affair ==
In 1881, due to the lack of heirs to the Romanian throne, King Carol I adopted his nephew, [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]]. Ferdinand, a complete stranger in his new home, started to get close to one of Elisabeth's ladies in waiting [[Elena V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]]. Elisabeth, very close to Elena herself, encouraged the romance, although she was perfectly aware of the fact that a marriage between the two was forbidden by the Romanian constitution. (According to the [[1866 Constitution of Romania]], the heir to the throne was not allowed to marry a Romanian).

The result of this was the exile of both Elisabeth (in [[Neuwied]]) and Elena (in [[Paris]]), as well as a trip by Ferdinand through [[Europe]] in search of a suitable bride, whom he eventually found in [[Queen Victoria]]'s granddaughter, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh, Queen of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]]. The affair helped reinforce Elisabeth's image as a dreamer and eccentric.

== A Republican Queen ==
Quite unusually for a queen, Elisabeth of Wied was personally of the opinion that a Republican form of government was preferable to Monarchy - an opinion which she expressed forthrightly in her diary, though she did not make it public at the time:

{{quote|I must sympathize with the [[Social Democrats]], especially in view of the inaction and corruption of the nobles. These "little people", after all, want only what nature confers: equality. The Republican form of government is the only rational one. I can never understand the foolish people, the fact that they continue to tolerate us.<ref>Eugen Wolbe, ''Carmen Sylva'', Leipzig, 1933, p. 137, here quoted from Brigitte Hamann, ''Elisabeth: Kaiserin wider Willen'', Munich, 1982, translated to English as ''The Reluctant Empress'', New York, 1986 (a biography of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], who was Elisabeth of Wied's friend).</ref>}}
