'''''Mrs. Brown's Boys''''' is an award winning [[sitcom]] created by and starring [[Irish people|Irish]] writer and performer [[Brendan O'Carroll]]. The show is based on O'Carroll's stage plays about the character Agnes Browne, which were developed from books and straight-to-DVD films. The sitcom continues the stories of Agnes, now with the shortened surname "Brown", and her family who are played by real life close friends and family of O'Carroll's. After being slated by critics, the show has become a ratings success in both Ireland, where it is set, and the United Kingdom, where it is recorded. On 29 December 2012 the show began its third series. 

''Mrs Brown's Boys'' is a [[BBC Vision]] production, co-produced between [[BBC Scotland]], BocPix and [[RT<U+00C9>]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2011/03/mrs-browns-boys-returns-for-a.shtml|title=Mrs. Brown's Boys returns for a second series!|publisher=BBC|first=Jaine|last=Sykes|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>

==Background==
''Mrs. Brown's Boys'' appeared first on [[RT<U+00C9> 2fm]], an Irish radio station, in 1992 and then in a series of books written by [[Brendan O'Carroll]] from the mid-1990s onwards.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ring |first=Evelyn |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/kfqlojkfmhey/rss2/ |title='Mad' success for Mrs Brown |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=2011-11-26 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/ttv/thecafe/brendantatiana.html | work=RT<U+00C9> News | title=The Cafe | date=20 December 2005}}</ref> The books, entitled ''The Mammy'', ''The Chisellers'', ''The Granny'', and ''The Young Wan'', were first published in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], before being made available in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obrien.ie/author.cfm?authorID=8|title=Brendan O'Carroll: O'Brien Press Author}}</ref> In 2000, ''The Mammy'' was adapted into a film titled ''[[Agnes Browne]]'' with [[Anjelica Huston]] playing the title character. Following the success of the film, O'Carroll wrote a series of stories, adapted from the books, in which he played Mrs. Browne (now spelled 'Brown') and cast the rest of the family <U+2014> including many of his own relatives as characters. A series of seven, film-like adaptations were made, which went straight to DVD release. During this time, O'Carroll took the show on the road, appearing in a series of Mrs. Brown plays in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

In 2010, O'Carroll was approached to create a television series based on the stage show. He recruited a new cast mainly from family members and wrote a series of six thirty-minute episodes, together with an unbroadcast pilot, in order to encourage a network to pick up the series. [[RT<U+00C9> One]] subsequently bought the broadcast rights and the first, six-part series began airing on the channel from 1 January to 5 February 2011. In the United Kingdom, the [[BBC]] bought the rights and the first episode was transmitted on 21 February 2011.

Following the success of the first series, RT<U+00C9> and the BBC commissioned a second, which began with a Christmas special broadcast on 25 December 2011 on RT<U+00C9> One, and the next day on [[BBC One]]. The latter was the most watched television programme in Ireland over the Christmas season.<ref name=rte_christmas_2011_viewership/> The second series began on New Year's Eve 2011 in Ireland, and two days later in the United Kingdom.

After good rating figures for the second series, the BBC commissioned a third series. O'Carroll described the commission as "An extraordinary gift and we genuinely don't take it lightly. We're overwhelmed with the support of the audience and hopefully when they see what we've done with the second series they'll see that maybe the BBC is not totally mad."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2011/11/mrs-browns-boys-series-three.shtml|title=Mrs. Brown's Boys recommissioned for a third series|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Whilst Cheryl Taylor, Controller, Comedy Commissioning for the BBC has also commented on the commission of a third series, "The new Mrs Brown's episodes are rip-roaring fun and will delight her ever growing army of fans.

According to Gary Hollywood, who plays Dino, on a radio interview, a ''Mrs. Brown's Boys'' Christmas Special for the year 2013 will be filmed in May 2013, due to a busy schedule of UK touring and the potential of filming the ''Mrs. Brown'' film (due for cinematic release in June 2014) from September to November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary Hollywood Interview |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlTkXoXMdx0|accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref> On 30 January 2013, the BBC announced that two Christmas specials had been commissioned for 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/mrs-browns-boys-xmas-2013.html|title=Mrs Brown<U+2019>s Boys to return to BBC One at Christmas|publisher=BBC Media Centre|date=30 January 2013|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>

==Production==
''Mrs. Brown's Boys'' is recorded at the [[BBC Pacific Quay]] studios in [[Glasgow]], Scotland<ref>{{cite web|author=Marion Scott |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/television-news/2011/03/20/brown-is-the-new-back-as-mrs-brown-s-boys-is-set-to-return-86908-23003641/ |title=Brown is the new back as Mrs Brown's Boys is set to return |publisher=The Daily Record |date=2011-03-20 |accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref> and is recorded in front of a live audience, which is seen at the beginning and the end of each show. While a fictional storyline is the basis of each episode, the programme uses a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' style in which areas beyond the set, including equipment and crew, are sometimes seen and aspects of the show's production are lampooned within the fictional dialogue. The show takes a more irregular concept as bloopers such as characters getting lines wrong, [[corpsing]] and set, camera and prop faults are not edited out of the episodes. 

At the beginning of each episode Agnes Brown breaks the [[fourth wall]], with an introductory monologue. Each episode ends with Agnes again breaking the fourth wall to say goodbye. As the credits roll, the camera pulls out to see the audience and the cast of the entire episode lining up to take a bow. The finale of every series so far has ended with a music performance by the cast.

==International broadcast==
The series is also broadcast in [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Iceland]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0425/1224315143931.html|title='Thrilled' Carroll leads Irish Bafta charge|publisher=Irishtimes.com|first=Ronan|last=McGreevy|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=22 December 2012}}</ref> Broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] in Australia, the series has secured nearly 1 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Brown's Boys draws big audience|url=http://www.irishecho.com.au/2012/06/29/mrs-browns-boys-draws-big-audience/19423|publisher=Irish Echo|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
{{unbalanced|section|date=September 2012}}
Although the show has had high viewership, it has received poor reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/critics-hate-us-but-they-never-say-how-the-audience-is-screaming-with-laughter-2589289.html|title=Critics hate us but they never say how the audience is screaming with laughter|first=Melanie|last=Finn|publisher=Herald.ie|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref> From the start critics hated it; "The whole thing is entirely predicated on viewers finding a man dressed as a foul-mouthed elderly woman intrinsically funny", noted Bernice Harrison, TV reviewer with ''[[The Irish Times]]''.

There have been reports that an estimated <U+00A3>3.6m deal is in place with [[Universal Studios]] to start production on the film version of the series. A spokesman for O'Carroll has also confirmed that the film will have a distinctly Dublin flavour, "It's Dublin humour so you're going to need Dublin actors and technicians to get it right for the big screen."<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Brown's Boys gets a $6m movie deal|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/mrs-browns-boys-gets-a-6m-movie-deal-16212911.html|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> Despite funding being secured, O'Carroll confirmed that the script has not been written. "I haven't written it yet. That's what success does, they give you money and say 'Whatever you think'. So I've taken the money!".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2012/0529/mrsbrownsboys.html | work=RT<U+00C9> News | title=Mrs Browns Boys to be made into movie | date=29 May 2012}}</ref> At the 2013 National Television Awards O'Carroll confirmed the film had been written and will begin shooting the following autumn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brendan O'Carroll confirms 'Mrs Brown' movie at NTAs 2013 |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a453373/brendan-ocarroll-confirms-mrs-brown-movie-at-ntas-2013.html|accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>
