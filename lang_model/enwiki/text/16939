== Designing the class ==
[[Image:Alaska class drawings.jpg|thumb|left|United States Navy recognition drawing made for the ''Alaska'' class, prepared circa 1945.]]

Heavy cruiser development had been held steady between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] by the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and successor [[Second London Naval Treaty|treaties and conferences]].  In this treaty, the United States, [[United Kingdom| Britain]], Japan, France, and Italy had agreed to limit [[heavy cruiser]]s to 10,000&nbsp;tons [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] with 8-inch (20 centimeter) main armament. US "treaty cruisers" designed between the wars followed this pattern. After the Treaty effectively lapsed in 1939, the designs were slightly enlarged into the [[Baltimore class cruiser|''Baltimore''-class]].<ref>Bauer and Roberts, 139.</ref>

The original idea for a U.S. class of battlecruiser began in the late 1930s, when the U.S. Navy wanted to counter both the German [[Scharnhorst class warship (1936)| ''Scharnhorst'' class]] and a new battlecruiser class (the notional ''Chichibu'' class)<ref name = "Fitzsimons 1 58" /> Japan supposedly had under construction.<ref name=Worth305>Worth, 305.</ref><ref group=A>''[[Jane's Fighting Ships| Jane's]]'' thought that this mythical battlecruiser would have six 12-inch guns and {{convert|30|kn|mph|2|adj=on}} speed packed into a 15,000-ton ship. See Worth, 305.</ref> The ''Alaska'' class were intended to serve as "cruiser-killers", in order to seek out and destroy this type of post-Treaty heavy cruiser.  To facilitate this, it was planned that this new class would be given large guns of a new (and expensive) design, limited armor protection against 12-inch shells, and machinery capable of speeds up to 31.4&ndash;33 knots (36.1&ndash;38 mph, 58.1&ndash;61 km/h).

The initial impetus for the design of the ''Alaska''s came from reports that Japan was planning and/or building "super cruisers" that were much more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.<ref name="Conway's">Gardiner and Chesneau, 122.</ref> <ref name="Global Security">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cb-1.htm |title=CB-1 ''Alaska'' Class |accessyear=2008| accessdaymonth = 19 October |last=Pike |first=John |year=2008 |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}</ref><ref group=A>Japan actually developed plans for two of the "super cruisers" in 1941, though it was mostly in response to these new ''Alaska''{{'}}s.  However, the ships were never ordered due to the greater need for carriers.</ref> The Navy responded in 1938, when a request from the [[General Board of the United States Navy|General Board]] was sent to the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] for a "comprehensive study of all types of naval vessels for consideration for a new and expanded building program."<ref name=Dulin189>Dulin, Jr., Garzke, Jr., 189.</ref> The President of the time, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], might have inspired the idea for the class<ref name=Morison85>Morison, Morison and Polmar, 85.</ref> with his desire to have a counter to the raiding abilities of Japanese cruisers and German battlecruisers/"pocket battleships",<ref name=Dulin179>Dulin, Jr. and Garzke, Jr., 179.</ref> but these claims are hard to verify.<ref name="Conway's">Gardiner and Chesneau, 122.</ref>

The design process of the ''Alaska'' class was "torturous"<ref name=Worth305/> because of the numerous changes and modifications made to the ships' layouts by many different departments and individuals;<ref name=Worth305/> indeed, the ship had at least nine different planned layouts,<ref>Dulin, Jr. and Garzke, Jr., 179&ndash;183.</ref> ranging from 6,000 ton [[Atlanta class cruiser|''Atlanta'' class]] [[Cruiser#Anti-aircraft_cruisers|anti&ndash;aircraft cruisers]],<ref name=Dulin179/> to "overgrown" [[heavy cruisers]]<ref name=Worth305/> to a 38,000 ton mini-[[battleship]] that would have been armed with twelve 12-in guns and sixteen 5-in guns.<ref name=Dulin179/> The General Board, in trying to keep the displacement under 25,000 tons, allowed the designers to have only limited underwater protection in their designs to try to save weight. As a result, the ''Alaska''s, when built, were vulnerable to torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship.<ref name=Dulin183>Dulin, Jr., Garzke, Jr., 183.</ref> Early in their development, the class used the designation CC, signifying battlecruisers in the tradition of the ''Lexington''s;<ref group=A>The ''Lexington'' class would have been designated CC-1 through CC-6, had they been built.</ref> the designation was changed to CB to reflect their new name of "large cruiser", and the practice of referring to them as "battlecruisers" was officially discouraged.<ref name=Morison85/>

The class was officially ordered on 9 September 1940 along with a plethora of other ships during the 70% Expansion ("Two Ocean Navy") building program.<ref name="Global Security"/><ref name=Rohwer40>Rohwer, 40.</ref><ref group=A>Along with the ''Alaska''{{'}}s, there were 210 other ships ordered at the same time: two {{Sclass|Iowa|battleship}}s, five {{Sclass|Montana|battleship|2}}s, twelve {{sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s, four {{sclass|Baltimore|heavy cruiser}}s, 19 {{sclass|Cleveland|light cruiser}}s, four {{sclass|Atlanta|light cruiser|2}}s, 52 {{sclass|Fletcher|destroyer}}s, twelve {{sclass|Benson|destroyer|2}}s and 73 {{sclass|Gato|submarine}}s.</ref> The new ships' role had been altered slightly: in addition to their surface-to-surface role, it was also planned for them to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers. would also provide insurance against reports that Japan was building "super cruisers" more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.<ref name="Global Security"/>
	
Yet another drastic change was considered, during the "carrier panic" of early 1942. This was the point in the war where the Navy, and the President, realized that the next fleet carriers, the {{Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier|3}}s, had not even been laid down yet and only one ({{USS|Hornet|CV-12}}) would enter service before 1944.<ref group=A>{{USS|Franklin|CV-13}} was eventually commissioned on 31 January 1944.</ref> It was decided to convert a few hulls that were currently under construction. At different parts of 1942, the [[Bureau of Ships]] considered converting some of the {{Sclass|Cleveland|light cruiser|2}}s, a few of the {{Sclass|Baltimore|heavy cruiser|2}}s, all six ''Alaska''{{'}}s, or even one of the {{Sclass|Iowa|battleship|2}}s to [[aircraft carrier]]s.<ref name=Friedman190>Friedman, 190.</ref>

A conversion of the ''Alaska''s to carriers was "particularly attractive"<ref name=Friedman190/> because of the many similarities between the design of the {{Sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier|2}}s and the ''Alaska''s, including the same machinery.<ref name = "Fitzsimons 1 58"/> However, when compared with the ''Essex'' class, the ''Alaska''s would have had a shorter flight deck (so they could have carried only 90% of the aircraft),<ref name=Friedman190/> they would have been 11 feet (3.35 m) lower in the water, and they could travel 8,000 miles (13,000 km) fewer at {{convert|15|kn|mph}}. In addition, the large cruiser design did not include the massive underwater protections found in normal carriers due to the armor weight devoted to counter shell fire. In the end, the ''Cleveland'' class was chosen because the biggest factor was "speed of production", which was found with the ''Cleveland''s but not the others.<ref name=Friedman191>Friedman, 191.</ref>

== Armament ==
=== Main battery ===
[[Image:Guam firing.jpg|thumb|right|''Guam'' firing her main battery during a training session sometime in 1944&ndash;1945.]]

''Puerto Rico'' would have been equipped with  nine [[12"/50 caliber gun|12"/50 caliber]] Mark 8 guns mounted in three triple (3-gun) turrets with two turrets forward and one aft, a configuration known as "2-A-1". The previous 12" gun manufactured for the U.S. Navy was the Mark 7 version had been designed and installed in the 1912 {{Sclass|Wyoming|battleship}}s.<ref name="12/50">{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = 12"/50 (30.5 cm) Mark 8  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_12-50_mk8.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 2008-02-07 | accessdate = 2008-10-15 }}</ref> The Mark 8 was "greatly superior" to this version; in fact, it "was by far the most powerful weapon of its caliber ever placed in service.<ref>Dulin, Jr. and Garzke, Jr., 190.</ref> Designed in 1939, it weighed {{convert|121856|lb|kg}} including the [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]] and was capable of an average rate of fire of 2.4&ndash;3 rounds a minute. It could throw a 1,140 lb. (517.093 kg) Mark 18 [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor piercing]] shell 38,573 yards (35,271 m) at an elevation of 45<U+00B0>, while the "barrel life" of the guns was 344 shots<ref name="12/50"/> (compared to the [[16"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun]] found in the ''Iowa''s, ''Alaska''s could fire about 54 more shots).<ref>{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = United States of America 16"/50 (40.6 cm) Mark 7  | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 2008-02-07 | accessdate = 2008-10-16 }}</ref> 

The turrets were very similar to those of the ''Iowa''s. The ''Alaska'' class had a two-stage powder hoist ''versus'' just one in ''Iowa''s. This made it safer to operate the guns, while also increasing the rate of fire. There was also a "projectile rammer" that transferred shells from storage on the ship to the rotating ring that fed the guns. However, this feature proved unsatisfactory, and it was not included upon ''Hawaii'' nor was it planned to include this on any subsequent ships, including ''Puerto Rico''.<ref name="12/50"/>

Because the only ships in the Navy to use or plan to use these guns were the ''Alaska''s, only ten turrets were made during the war (three for each ship built, including ''Hawaii'', with one as a spare). Due to this degree of uniqueness, they cost the Navy $1,550,000 each, and were the most expensive heavy guns purchased by the U.S. Navy in World War II.<ref name=Morison85/>

=== Secondary battery ===
The secondary battery of ''Puerto Rico'' would have been composed of twelve {{convert|5|in|mm|0|adj=on}}/38 caliber guns in twin turrets, with four turrets offset on each side of the superstructure (two on each beam) and two centerline turrets fore and aft. The 5"/38 had originally been intended for use on [[destroyer]]s being built in the 1930s, but by 1934 and into World War II, it had been installed on nearly every major U.S. warship.<ref name="5/38">{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = United States of America 5"/38 (12.7&nbsp;cm) Mark 12 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_5-38_mk12.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 2008-03-27  | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref>

=== Anti-aircraft battery ===
The anti-aircraft batteries on ''Puerto Rico'' would probably have consisted of 56 x 40mm guns and 34 x 20mm guns, same as her sisters. These numbers can be compared to 48 x 40mm and 24 x 20mm on the smaller ''Baltimore''s and 80 x 40mm and 49 x 20mm on the larger ''Iowa''s.

==== Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft guns ====
[[Image:Bofors firing USS Hornet.jpg|thumb|right|Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft guns on a MK 12 quadruple mount fire from the deck of the {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}} in World War II.]]

Arguably the best light [[anti-aircraft gun]] of World War II, the 40mm Bofors was used on almost every major warship in the US and UK fleet during World War&nbsp;II from about 1943 to 1945. Although a descendant of German and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the United States Navy during World War II had been heavily "Americanized" to bring the guns up to the standards of the US Navy. This resulted in a gun system set to English standards (now known as the [[United States customary units|Standard System]]) with interchangeable ammunition, which simplified the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with hydraulic couple drives to reduce salt contamination and the Mark&nbsp;51 director for improved accuracy, the 40mm Bofors became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.<ref name="Bofors">{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = Sweden, British, USA, German and Japanese Bofors 40 mm/56 (1.57") Model 1936 | url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_4cm-56_mk12.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 2008-05-14 | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref>

==== Oerlikon 20mm anti-aircraft guns ====
The [[Oerlikon Contraves|Oerlikon]] [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20mm anti-aircraft gun]] was one of the most numerous anti-aircraft guns of World War&nbsp;II; The U.S. alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns. When activated in 1941, these guns replaced the [[M2 Browning machine gun|0.50" (12.7mm) M2 Browning MG]] on a one-for-one basis. The Oerlikon gun remained the primary anti-aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40mm Bofors in 1943.<ref name="Oerlikon">{{cite web | last = DiGiulian | first = Tony | title = British, Swiss and USA 20 mm/70 (0.79") Oerlikon Marks 1, 2, 3 and 4 | url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_2cm-70_mk234.htm | publisher = Navweaps.com | date = 2008-05-14 | accessdate = 2008-07-25 }}</ref>
