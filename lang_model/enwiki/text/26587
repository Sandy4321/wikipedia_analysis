'''Ray Russell''' ([[1924]]-[[1999]]) was a writer of short stories, several of which were adapted into [[screenplay]]s.  He is probably most well known for ''Sardonicus'', which appeared in the January 1961 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, and was subsequently adapted into a screenplay for [[William Castle]]'s film version, titled ''Mr. Sardonicus''.  [[Stephen King]] called ''Sardonicus'' "perhaps the finest example of the modern gothic ever written".
