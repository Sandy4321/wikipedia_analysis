The '''Extradition clause''' or '''Interstate rendition clause'''<ref name=Heritage>{{cite book | last = Heritage Foundation (Washington, D.C.) | title = The Heritage Guide to the Constitution | publisher = Regnery Publishing | year = 2005 | pages = 273 | location = Edwin Meese, III | isbn = 1-59698-001-X}}</ref> of the [[United States Constitution]] refers to [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]], [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Section 2: Obligations of states|Section 2]], [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Extradition of fugitives|Clause 2]], which provides for the extradition of a criminal back to the state where he or she has committed a crime.

==Text==
Article IV, Section 2, Clause 2:
{{quote|A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime, who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.}}

==History==
Similar to a clause found in the Articles of Confederation, the extradition clause was included because the founders found that interstate rendition was separate from international extradition. Fearing that it was not self-executing, Congress passed the first rendition act in 1793 <U+2013> now found under {{usc|18|3182}}.<ref name=Heritage/>

==Interpretation==
===''Kentucky v. Dennison''===
According to a book review in the [[''New York Times'']] in January 2015: 
:"The [[Northwest Ordinance]] of July 1787 held that slaves <U+201C>may be lawfully reclaimed<U+201D> from free states and territories, and soon after, a [[fugitive slave clause]] <U+2014> Article IV, Section 2 <U+2014> was woven into the Constitution at the insistence of the Southern delegates, leading South Carolina<U+2019>s [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] to boast, <U+201C>We have obtained a right to recover our slaves in whatever part of America they may take refuge, which is a right we had not before.<U+201D> <ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/books/review/gateway-to-freedom-by-eric-foner.html?rref=books/review Quote taken from book review by Kevin Baker, Jan. 28, 2015 of ''Gateway to Freedom'' by Eric Foner"]</ref> 

The meaning of the extradition clause was first tested before the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Kentucky v. Dennison]]''. The case involved a man named [[Willis Lago]] who was wanted in [[Kentucky]] for helping a [[slave]] girl escape. He had fled to [[Ohio]], where the governor, [[William Dennison, Jr.|William Dennison]], refused to extradite him back to Kentucky. In this case, the court ruled that, while it was the duty of a governor to return a fugitive to the state where the crime was committed, a governor could not be compelled through a [[writ of mandamus]] to do so.

===''Puerto Rico v. Branstad''===
{{main|Puerto Rico v. Branstad}}

In 1987, the court reversed its decision under ''Dennison''. The case involved an Iowan, Ronald Calder, who struck a married couple near [[Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]. The husband survived but the wife, who was eight months pregnant, did not. Following the incident, Calder was charged with murder and let out on bail. While on bail, Ronald Calder fled to his home-state of [[Iowa]]. In May 1981, the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] submitted a request to the [[Governor of Iowa]] for extradition of Ronald Calder to face murder charges. The Governor of Iowa refused the request, and the Governor of Puerto Rico filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa]]. The Court rejected it, ruling that under ''Kentucky v. Dennison'', the Governor of Iowa was not obligated to return Calder. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] affirmed. The Supreme Court, overruling its existing precedent, reversed, ruling unanimously that the Federal Courts did indeed have the power to enforce a writ of mandamus and that ''Kentucky v. Dennison'' was outdated.
