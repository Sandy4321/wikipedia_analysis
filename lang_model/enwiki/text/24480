'''<U+0100>ryabha{{Unicode|<U+1E6D>}}a''' ([[Devan<U+0101>gar<U+012B>]]: <U+0906><U+0930><U+094D><U+092F><U+092D><U+091F>) (AD [[476]] &ndash; [[550]]) is the first of the great mathematician-astronomers of the classical age of [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Indian astronomy]]. He was born at Muziris (the modern day Kodungallour village) near [[Thrissur]], [[Kerala]]. Available evidence suggest that he went to [[Patna|Kusumapura]] for higher studies.  He lived in Kusumapura, which his commentator [[Bhaskara I|Bh<U+0101>skara I]] (AD [[629]]) identifies as Pataliputra (modern [[Patna, India|Patna]]). K. Chandra Hari, a senior geoscientist at the Institute of Reservoir Studies of Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Ahmedabad has refuted this popular opinion and claims that based on his interpretation of Aryabhatta's system of measurements and writings, it is highly likely that he belonged to the modern Ponnani-Chamravattom area (latitude 10N51 and longitude 75E45) in Kerala in the 6th Century AD.[http://www.hindu.com/2007/06/25/stories/2007062558250400.htm The Hindu]

Aryabhata was the first in the line of brilliant mathematician-astronomers of classical Indian mathematics, whose major work was the '''''[[Aryabhatiya]]''''' and the ''Aryabhatta-siddhanta''. The Aryabhatiya presented a number of innovations in mathematics and astronomy in verse form, which were influential for many centuries. The extreme brevity of the text was elaborated in commentaries by his disciple [[Bhaskara I]] (''Bhashya'', ca. 600) and by 
[[Nilakantha Somayaji]] in his ''Aryabhatiya Bhasya,'' (1465).
The number place-value system, first seen in the
3rd century [[Bakhshali Manuscript]] was clearly
in place in his work.<ref>P. Z. Ingerman, 'Panini-Backus form', Communications of the ACM 10
(3)(1967), p.137</ref>  He may have been the first mathematician to 
use letters of the alphabet to denote unknown quantities.<ref>

Aryabhata's system of astronomy was called the ''audAyaka system'' (days are reckoned from ''uday'', dawn at ''lanka'', equator).  Some of his later writings on astronomy, which apparently
proposed a second model (''ardha-rAtrikA'', midnight), are lost, but can be partly 
reconstructed from the discussion in  [[Brahmagupta]]'s ''khanDakhAdyaka''.  In some texts he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens to the earth's rotation.

==The Aryabhatiya==
{{Mergefrom|Aryabhatiya|date=April 2007}}
===Pi as Irrational===

Aryabhata worked on the approximation for [[Pi]], and may have realized that <math>\pi</math> is irrational. In the second part of the Aryabhatiyam. In other words, <math>\pi \approx 62832/20000 = 3.1416</math>, correct to five digits.

===Mensuration and Trigonometry===

In Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the '''area of triangle''' as 
: ''tribhujasya phalashariram samadalakoti bhujardhasamvargah'' (for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the half-side is the area.)<ref>{{Cite book

 | quote=Aryabhata gave the correct rule for the are of a triangle and an incorrect rule for the volume of a pyramid. (He claimed that the volume was half the height times the area of the base.)}}</ref>

===Motions of the Solar System===

Aryabhata described a [[geocentric]] model of the solar system, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by [[epicycle]]s which in turn revolve around the Earth.  In this model, which is also found in the ''Pait<U+0101>mahasiddh<U+0101>nta'' (ca. AD 425), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller ''manda'' (slow) epicycle and a larger ''<U+015B><U+012B>ghra'' (fast) epicycle.<ref>David Pingree, "Astronomy in India", pp. 127-9.</ref>   The positions and periods of the planets were calculated relative to uniformly moving points, which in the case of Mercury and Venus, move around the Earth at the same speed as the mean Sun and in the case of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn move around the Earth at specific speeds representing each planet's motion through the zodiac.  Most historians of astronomy consider that this two epicycle model reflects elements of pre-Ptolemaic [[Greek astronomy#Hellenistic astronomy|Greek astronomy]].<ref>Otto Neugebauer, "The Transmission of Planetary Theories in Ancient and Medieval Astronomy," ''Scripta Mathematica'', 22(1956): 165-192; reprinted in Otto Neugebauer, ''Astronomy and History: Selected Essays,'' New York: Springer-Verlag, 1983, pp. 129-156.  ISBN 0-387-90844-7</ref>  Another element in Aryabhata's model, the ''<U+015B><U+012B>ghrocca'', the basic planetary period in relation to the Sun, is seen by some historians as a sign of an underlying [[heliocentric]] model.<ref>Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy,'' New York: Springer-Verlag, 1996, pp. 178-189.  ISBN 0-387-94822-8</ref>

He states that the [[Moon]] and planets shine by reflected sunlight.  He also correctly explains eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, and presents methods for their calculation and prediction.

Another statement, referring to ''Lanka '', describes the movement of the stars as a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth: 
:Like a man in a boat moving forward sees the stationary objects as moving backward, just so are the stationary stars seen by the people in lankA (i.e. on the equator) as moving exactly towards the West.  [''achalAni bhAni samapashchimagAni'' - golapAda.9]

However, in the next verse he describes the motion of the stars and planets as real: <U+201C>The cause of their rising and setting is due to the fact the circle of the asterisms together with the planets driven by the provector wind, constantly moves westwards at Lanka<U+201D>.

''Lanka'' here is a reference point on the equator, which was taken as the equivalent to the reference meridian for astronomical calculations.

Aryabhata's computation of Earth's [[circumference]] as 24,835 miles, which was only 0.2% smaller than the actual value of 24,902 miles. This approximation improved on the computation by the Alexandrinan mathematician 
[[Erastosthenes]] (c.[[200 BC]]), whose exact computation is not known in modern units.

====Sidereal periods====

Considered in modern English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the [[sidereal rotation]] (the rotation of the earth referenced the fixed stars) as 23 hours  56 minutes and 4.1 seconds; the modern value is 23:56:4.091.  Similarly, his value for the length of the [[sidereal year]] at 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds is an error of 3 minutes 20 seconds over the length of a year. The notion of sidereal time was known in most other astronomical systems of the time, but this computation was likely the most accurate in the period.

====Heliocentrism====

<U+0100>ryabhata claims that the Earth turns on its own axis and some elements of his planetary epicyclic models rotate at the same speed as the motion of the planet around the Sun.  This has suggested to some interpreters that <U+0100>ryabhata's calculations were based on an underlying [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model in which the planets orbit the Sun.<ref>The concept of Indian heliocentrism has been advocated by B. L. van der Waerden, ''Das heliozentrische System in der griechischen, persischen und indischen Astronomie.'' Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Z<U+00FC>rich. Z<U+00FC>rich:Kommissionsverlag Leeman AG, 1970.</ref><ref>B. L. van der Waerden, "The Heliocentric System in Greek, Persian and Hindu Astronomy", in David A. King and George Saliba, ed., ''From Deferent to Equant: A Volume of Studies in the History of Science in the Ancient and Medieval Near East in Honor of E. S. Kennedy'', Annals of the New York Academy of Science, 500 (1987), pp. 529-534.</ref> A detailed rebuttal to this heliocentric interpretation is in a review which describes van der Waerden's book as "show[ing] a complete misunderstanding of Indian planetary theory [that] is flatly contradicted by every word of <U+0100>ryabhata's description,"<ref>Noel Swerdlow, "Review: A Lost Monument of Indian Astronomy," ''Isis'', 64 (1973): 239-243.</ref> although some concede that <U+0100>ryabhata's system stems from an earlier heliocentric model of which he was unaware.<ref>Dennis Duke, "The Equant in India: The Mathematical Basis of Ancient Indian Planetary Models." ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'' 59 (2005): 563<U+2013>576, n. 4[http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/india8.pdf].</ref> It has even been claimed that he considered the planet's paths to be [[Ellipse|elliptical]], although no primary evidence for this has been cited.<ref>J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Aryabhata_I.html Aryabhata the Elder], [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]'':
<br>{{quote|"He believes that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight, incredibly he believes that the orbits of the planets are ellipses."}}</ref> Though [[Aristarchus of Samos]] (3rd century BC) and sometimes [[Heraclides of Pontus]] (4th century BC) are usually credited with knowing the heliocentric theory, the version of [[Greek astronomy]] known in ancient India, ''[[Paulisa Siddhanta]]'' (possibly by a [[Paulus Alexandrinus|Paul]] of [[Alexandria]]) makes no reference to a Heliocentric theory. The ''<U+0100>ryabhat<U+012B>ya'' influenced many early [[Arabic]] astronomical tables ([[zij]]es) that were translated into [[Latin]] in the [[12th century]], thereby influencing European astronomy. The 10th century Arabic scholar [[Ab<U+016B> al-Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>|Al-Biruni]] states that <U+0100>ryabhata's followers believed the Earth to rotates on its axis. Then he casually adds that this notion does not create any mathematical difficulties.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Diophantine Equations===
A problem of great interest to [[Indian mathematicians]] since very ancient times concerned [[diophantine equations]].  These involve integer solutions to equations such as ax + b = cy.  Here is an 
example from [[Bhaskara]]'s commentary on Aryabhatiya: : 
: Find the number which gives 5 as the remainder when divided by 8, 4 as the remainder when divided by 9 and 1 as the remainder when divided by 7. 
i.e. find N = 8x+5 = 9y+4 = 7z+1.  It turns out that the smallest value for N is 85.  In general, 
diophantine equations can be notoriously difficult. Such equations were considered extensively in the ancient Vedic text [[Sulba Sutras]], the more ancient parts of which may date back to [[800 BCE]].  Aryabhata's method of solving such problems, called the ''kuttaka'' (<U+0915><U+0942><U+091F><U+093E><U+0915>) method. Kuttaka means pulverizing, that is breaking into small pieces, and the method involved a recursive algorithm for writing the original factors in terms of smaller numbers. Today this algorithm, 
as elaborated by Bhaskara in AD [[621]], is the standard method for solving first order Diophantine equations, 
and it is often referred to as the [[Aryabhata algorithm]].  See details of the Kuttaka method in this
[http://www.ias.ac.in/resonance/Oct2002/pdf/Oct2002p6-22.pdf|article].

The [[lunar crater]] [[Aryabhata (crater)|Aryabhata]] is named in his honour.

== Continued Relevance ==

Aryabhata's astronomical calculation methods have been in continuous use for the practical purposes of fixing the [[Panchanga]], or [[Hindu calendar]].

The [[lunar crater]] [[Aryabhata (crater)|Aryabhata]] is named in his honour.
