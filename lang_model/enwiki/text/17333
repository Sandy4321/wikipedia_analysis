'''Philip Hampson "Phil" Knight''' (born February 24, 1938) is an American [[business magnate]]. A native of [[Oregon]], he is the co-founder and [[chairman]] of [[Nike, Inc.]], and previously served as the chief executive officer of Nike. By 2011, Knight's stake in Nike gave him an estimated net worth of [[US$]]14.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], making him the 47th richest person in the world and the 19th richest American.<ref name="Forbes profile page on Phil Knight"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/profile/phil-knight/ | work=Forbes}}</ref>

A graduate of the [[University of Oregon]] and [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]], he has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to the schools; Knight gave the largest donation in history at the time to Stanford's business school in 2006. A native Oregonian, he ran track under coach [[Bill Bowerman]] at the University of Oregon, with whom he would co-found Nike.

==Early years==
Phil Knight is the son of "a lawyer turned newspaper publisher", [[William W. Knight (publisher)|William W. Knight]], and his wife Lota (Hatfield) Knight.<ref name=stanford>{{cite journal|last=Krentzman|first=Jackie|year=1997|title=The Force Behind the Nike Empire|journal=''Stanford Magazine''|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/1997/janfeb/articles/knight.html|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref><ref name=answers>[http://www.answers.com/topic/phil-knight "Phil Knight".] Accessed May 13, 2012.</ref> Growing up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, he attended [[Cleveland High School (Portland, Oregon)|Cleveland High School]] in Portland. According to one source, "When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper [the ''[[Oregon Journal]]''], believing that his son should find work on his own, Buck went to the rival ''[[Oregonian]]'', where he worked the night shift tabulating sports scores and every morning ran home the full seven miles."<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20112607,00.html Susan Hauser. 1992. "Must Be the Shoes," ''People'', May 4, pp.139-140.] Accessed: May 13, 2012.</ref>

Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], where he was a member of [[Phi Gamma Delta]] ("FIJI") fraternity, was a sports reporter for the ''[[Oregon Daily Emerald]]'',<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=198743853490625 "25 Things about the Oregon Daily Emerald", March 29, 2011.] Accessed May 13, 2012.</ref> and earned a business administration degree in 1959.<ref name=stanford/> As a middle-distance runner at the school, his personal best was 4:10 mile,<ref>{{cite web | title = Notable Oregonians: Phil Knight&nbsp;<U+2014> Innovator, Business Leader | publisher = ''Oregon Blue Book'' | url = http://bluebook.state.or.us/notable/notknight.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> winning [[varsity letter]]s for track in 1957, 1958, and 1959.

===Budding entrepreneur===

Immediately after graduating from Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]].<ref name=stanford/> After the year of active duty, he enrolled at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].<ref name=stanford/> In Frank Shallenberger's Small Business class, Knight developed a love affair with something besides sports&nbsp;<U+2014> he discovered he was an entrepreneur. Knight recalls in a ''Stanford Magazine'' article:<ref name=stanford/> "That class was an 'aha!' moment ... Shallenberger defined the type of person who was an entrepreneur--and I realized he was talking to me. I remember after saying to myself: 'This is really what I would like to do.' " In this class, Knight needed to create a business plan.  His paper, "Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?," essentially was the premise to his foray into selling running shoes. He graduated with a master's degree in business administration from the school in 1962.<ref name=stanford/>

Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]], in November 1962. It was there he discovered the Tiger-brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co. So impressed with the quality and low cost, Knight made a cold call on Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight, during which time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bill Bowerman in Eugene hoping to gain a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight's surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes but also offered to become a partner with Knight and would provide some design ideas for better running shoes. The two men shook hands on a partnership on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, forerunner to Nike.<ref>www.nikebiz.com</ref>

===Early career and family===

Before Blue Ribbon Sports, later Nike, took off, Knight was first a Certified Public Accountant with [[Price Waterhouse]], and then [[Coopers & Lybrand]]; and an assistant professor of business administration at [[Portland State University]].<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002095212_nike19.html Anne M. Peterson, "Nike's Phil Knight resigns as CEO," ''Seattle Times'', November 19, 2004.] Accessed May 13, 2012.</ref> While at Portland State, he met his future wife, Penelope "Penny" Parks; they were married on September 13, 1968.<ref>[http://www.womensconference.org/phil-knight/ "Phil Knight: How He Empowers Others", The Woman's Conference.] Accessed: May 13, 2012.</ref>

==Nike's origin==
Knight's first sales were made out of a now legendary green [[Plymouth Valiant]] automobile at track meets across the [[Pacific Northwest]]. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full time for Blue Ribbon Sports.

Jeff Johnson, a friend of Knight, suggested calling the firm Nike, named after the Greek [[Nike (mythology)|winged goddess of victory]]. Nike's logo, now considered one of the most powerful logos in the world more for its ubiquity than its aesthetic merits, was commissioned for a mere $35 from [[Carolyn Davidson]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref>  According to Nike's Web site, Knight stated: "I  don't love it, but it will grow on me." In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company's brand. On the Oprah TV program in April 2011, Knight claimed he gave her "A few hundred shares" when the company went public.

===Labor issues===
Knight was named a "corporate crook" in [[Michael Moore]]'s 1996 book ''[[Downsize This!]]''. The book cited the harsh conditions in [[Indonesia]]n [[sweatshop]]s, where pregnant women and girls as young as age 14 sewed shoes for factories that the company contracted to make its products. Moore went to Knight in the hopes of convincing him to fix this problem. The interview can be seen in Moore's film ''[[The Big One (film)|The Big One]]''&nbsp;. Of the nearly 20 CEOs whom Moore wished to interview for his movie, only Knight agreed to speak with Moore.

When questioned by Moore as to why no shoes were made in the United States, Knight responded that he was convinced Americans weren't interested in producing shoes. Moore responded with a challenge. If Moore could find 500 residents from his hometown of Flint, Michigan, who were willing to work in a Nike factory, would Nike then create a factory there. Knight accepted the challenge by saying he would seriously consider it. However, when Moore provided video evidence showing residents of Flint enthusiastically promising to work for a Nike factory, Knight backed down saying he would never seriously consider opening a factory there. Knight informed Moore that Nike does not own any of the factories that make its products. Knight told Moore if he were willing to invest in and build a factory in the U.S. that could match the price of footwear made overseas, Nike would consider buying shoes from Michael Moore.

In 1998, Knight pledged to impose more stringent standards for the factories that Nike engages to manufacture its goods, including minimum age standards, factory monitoring, and greater external access to Nike's practices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Philanthropy==
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the [[Oregon Sports Hall of Fame]] for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon.<ref name=oshof>{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonsportshall.org/philip_knight.html|publisher=Oregon Sports Hall of Fame|title=Philip H. Knight - Special Contribution |accessdate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> He is believed to have contributed approximately $230 million  to the University of Oregon, the majority of which was for athletics.<ref>{{cite web | first = Rachel | last = Bachman | coauthors = Hunsberger, Brent | title = Phil Knight's influence transforms University of Oregon athletics | publisher = The Oregonian | date = May 4, 2008 | url= http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/sports/1209711308201850.xml&coll=7&thispage=2 | accessdate = 2008-06-01 }}</ref> On August 18, 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife, Penny, would be donating an additional $100 million to the University of Oregon Athletics Legacy Fund.<ref>{{cite web | first = Ron | last = Bellamy | title =  Knights to give major gift to UO | publisher = ''Eugene Register Guard'' | date = August 20, 2007 | url = http://www.registerguard.com/rgn/index.php/sports_updates/more/knights_to_give_major_gift_to_uo/ | accessdate = 2008-06-01}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> This donation is reportedly the largest in the University's history.

His significant contributions have granted him influence and access atypical of an athletic booster. In addition to having the best seats in the stadium for all University of Oregon athletic events, he has his own locker in the football team's locker room. An athletic building is named for him, the library for his mother, the law school for his father, and the basketball teams' home, [[Matthew Knight Arena]], is named for his late son, who died in a SCUBA diving accident. 

However, Knight's contributions to the Athletic Department at the University of Oregon have also led to controversy.<ref>{{cite web | first = Mike | last = Fish | title = Just do it! | publisher = ESPN.com

Public outcry surrounding Nike's labor practices precipitated protests in 2000, led by a group of students calling themselves the [[Human Rights Alliance]]. Protests included a ten-day tent-city occupation on the lawns in front of Johnson Hall, the main administration building, demanding that the university join the [[Worker Rights Consortium]] (WRC) which was founded by [[United Students Against Sweatshops]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2000/04/05/News/Were-Not.Going.To.Leave-1971980.shtml |title= We're not going to leave |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |last=Ripke |first=Simone |date=2000-04-05 |publisher=''Oregon Daily Emerald''}}</ref>

University President [[Dave Frohnmayer]] signed a one-year contract with the WRC. Knight's reaction was to withdraw a previous US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and to offer no further donations to the university.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2001/04/04/News/Old-Issues.New.Strategies-1973596.shtml |title= Old issues, new strategies |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |last=Lang |first=Jeremy |date=2001-04-04 |publisher=''Oregon Daily Emerald''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2000/04/24/News/Knight.Pulls.All.Money-1963987.shtml |title= Knight pulls all money |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |last=Romano |first=Ben |date=2000-04-24 |publisher=''Oregon Daily Emerald''}}</ref> Nike had endorsed the industry-supported [[Fair Labor Association]], instead.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2000/04/25/News/Nike-Backs.Worker.Rights.Through.Fla.But.Not.Wrc-1963988.shtml |title= Nike backs worker rights through FLA, but not WRC |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |last=Romano |first=Ben |date=2000-04-25 |publisher=''Oregon Daily Emerald''}}</ref> In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being "balanced" in its approach.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2000/04/24/News/Statement.From.Nike.Founder.And.Ceo.Philip.H.Knight.Regarding.The.University.Of-1963996.shtml |title= Statement from Nike founder and CEO Philip H.

In October 2000, citing a legal opinion from the university's counsel, President Frohnmayer released a statement saying that the university could not pay its membership dues to the WRC since the WRC was neither an incorporated entity nor had tax-exempt status, and to do so would be a violation of state law. The [[Oregon University System]] on February 16, 2001, enacted a mandate that all institutions within the  system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from membership in the WRC and FLA.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2001/03/05/News/Ous-Policy.Wont.Stop.Labor.Debate-1973368.shtml |title= OUS policy won't stop labor debate |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |last=Adams |first=Andrew |date=2001-03-05 |publisher=''Oregon Daily Emerald''}}</ref> Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Phil Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over $50 million dollars.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002095212_nike19.html |title= Nike's Phil Knight resigns as CEO |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |last=Peterson |first=Anne |date=2004-11-19 |publisher=''The Seattle Times''}}</ref> 

Also controversial was Knight's successful lobbying to have his friend and a former insurance salesman, Pat Kilkenny, named as Athletic Director at the university.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=3326346&categoryid=null | title=OTL: Phil Knight and Oregon| date=2 April 2008| publisher=[[ESPN]]| work=[[Outside the Lines]]| format=[[Flash video]]| accessdate=2009-11-12}}</ref> Kilkenny, another wealthy athletic booster, had neither a college degree nor any prior experience in athletics administration. Kilkenny attended but did not graduate from the university, leaving the school several [[credit hours]] short of completion.

In 2006, Phil Knight donated $105 million to the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Christian L. | last = Tom | title = Nike Founder Donates $105 million to GSB | publisher = ''[[The Stanford Daily]]'' | date = September 19, 2006 | url = http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2006/9/19/nikeFounderDonates105MillionToGsb | accessdate = 2008-06-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He also provided monetary support to his high school alma mater, [[Cleveland High School (Portland, Oregon)|Cleveland High School]], for its new track, football field, and gymnasium.

In October 2008, Phil and Penny Knight pledged $100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of [[Oregon Health & Science University]], renamed Oregon Health Sciences University in 1981. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the OHSU [[Knight Cancer Institute]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/news_events/news/cancergift102908.cfm | title= Knights to give $100 million to OHSU Cancer Institute| date=October 29, 2008 | publisher=[[Oregon Health & Science University]]| accessdate=2009-11-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Later years==
When Knight resigned as the company's CEO November 18, 2004, and retained the position of chairman of the board,<ref>{{cite news | first = Anne M. | last = Peterson | title = Nike's Phil Knight resigns as CEO | publisher = ''The Seattle Times'' | date = November 19, 2004 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002095212_nike19.html | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Eric | last = Dash | title = Founder of Nike to Hand Off Job to a New Chief | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = November 19, 2004 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/business/19nike.html | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}</ref> he was replaced by [[William Perez]], former CEO of [[S.C.

In 2002, Knight purchased [[Will Vinton]] (Animation) Studios, where son [[Travis Knight (animator)|Travis]] worked as an animator, and changed the name to [[Laika (company)|LAIKA]]. Travis was named to the Laika board of directors later that year and became CEO of LAIKA in March 2009, replacing Nike former-employee Dale Wahl.<ref>{{cite web | first = Chuck | last = Salter | title = The Knights' Tale | publisher = ''Fast Company'' | date = December 19, 2007 | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/117/features-the-knights-tale.html | accessdate = 2009-10-27}}</ref> Laika released its first feature film [[Coraline (film)|Coraline]] (in stop motion) in February 2009.

In 2009-2010, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat [[Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67 (2010)|Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67]], which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and on high-income individuals.<ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/03/the_closing_tally_on_measures.html ''The Oregonian'', "The closing tally on the Measures 66 and 67 campaigns: $12.5 million" March 03, 2010]</ref>

On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a [[List of members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame#Contributors|contributor]]. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike's huge financial support for the sport and its players.
