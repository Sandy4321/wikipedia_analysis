'''''Before and after Science''''' is the fifth studio album by British musician [[Brian Eno]]. Produced by Eno and [[Rhett Davies]], it was originally released by [[Polydor Records]] in December 1977. Unlike Eno's previous albums which were written and recorded quickly, the album took over two years to complete. Several guest musicians from the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]] helped with the album, including members of [[Roxy Music]], [[Free (band)|Free]], [[Fairport Convention]], [[Can (band)|Can]] and [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]]. Over one-hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical styles of the album range from energetic and jagged to the later tracks which are more languid and pastoral.

The album marks Eno's last foray into rock music for the 1970s as a solo artist, with all his remaining albums of the decade showcasing more of Eno's avant-garde and [[ambient music]], which was hinted at on the second half of ''Before and After Science''. The album was Eno's second to chart in the United States. The song "King's Lead Hat" was released as a single although it didn't chart in the United Kingdom. Both initial and more recent critical response to the album was positive with several critics calling it one of Eno's best works.

==Production==
Unlike Eno's previous albums which were recorded in a very short time, ''Before and after Science'' was two years in the making.<ref name="Tamm107">Tamm, 1989. p.107</ref> During this two year period, Eno was busy working on his solo [[ambient music]] albums ''[[Music for Films]]'' and ''[[Discreet Music]]''.<ref name="Tamm107" /> Due to the very positive critical reception to his previous [[rock music]]-oriented album ''[[Another Green World]]'', Eno was afraid of repeating himself but still wanted to release a high quality product.<ref name="Tamm107" /> 

Like his previous rock-based recordings, Eno used a plethora of guest musicians on ''Before and after Science''. Several artists from German and British groups of the era contributed to the album, collaborating with Eno for the first time. [[Guitarist]] [[Fred Frith]] caught the attention of [[Brian Eno]] who was "excited by the timbral possibilities that [Frith had] been discovering" on his album ''[[Guitar Solos]]''.<ref name=moffom> {{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071214042237/www.moffom.org/en/iaf-fred-frith.php|archivedate=21 January 2008|url=http://www.moffom.org/en/articles-and-interviews/interview-fred-frith |date=January 2007|title=Interview with Fred Frith |work=Music on Film / Film on Music|last=J<U+00F3>nsson|first=Darryl |accessdate=16 July 2009}}</ref> Eno asked Frith to record with him, and this resulted in Frith playing guitar on the album.<ref name=moffom/> [[Jaki Liebezeit]] of the [[Music of Germany|German]] [[krautrock]] group [[Can (band)|Can]] played drums for Eno on "Backwater" while German [[ambient music]] group  [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]] contributed to the songwriting and instrumentation of the track "By This River".<ref name="albumNotes" /><ref name=Allmusic /> Eno had previously worked with Cluster on their album ''[[Cluster & Eno]]'' released in 1977.<ref name=AllmusicCluster>{{cite web

The album's opening tracks "No One Receiving" and "Backwater" start the album as upbeat and bouncy songs.<ref name=Allmusic /> Rock critic [[Lester Bangs]] described the song "King's Lead Hat" as a track that emphasizes "Eno's affinities with [[New Wave music|New Wave]] in its rushed mechanical rhythms".<ref name="BangsVoice" /> The song's title is an [[anagram]] of [[Talking Heads]], a New Wave group.

</ref> The last five songs of the album have been described as having "an occasional pastoral quality" and being "pensive and atmospheric".<ref name=Allmusic />

Opposed to ''[[Another Green World]]'''s music which Eno described as "sky music", Eno referred to the music of ''Before and after Science'' as "ocean music".<ref name="BangsVoice" /> References to water in the lyrics appear in songs such as "Backwater", "Julie With..." and "By this River".<ref name="Reynolds203">Reynolds, 1996. p.203</ref> Author Simon Reynolds noted themes of "boredom" and "bliss" through the album, citing "Here He Comes", about "a boy trying to vanish by floating through the sky through a different time" and "Spider and I", about a boy watching the sky and dreaming about being carried away with a ship, as examples.<ref name="Reynolds203" /> Eno's songwriting style was described as "a sound-over-sense approach".<ref name=Allmusic /> Influenced by poet [[Kurt Schwitters]], Eno consciously did not make songwriting or lyrics the main focus in the music.<ref name=Allmusic /> Tom Carson of ''Rolling Stone'' noted this style, stating that the lyrics are "only complementary variables" to the music on the album.<ref name=rollingstone>

==Reception==
On the album's initial release, the album received very positive reviews from rock critics. Writing for ''[[Creem]]'', Joe Fernbacher called the ''Before and after Science'' "the perfect Eno album".<ref name="creem">{{cite journal |title=Records:Before and After Science|year=1978 |month=April |journal=[[Creem]] |issue=9|pages=67 |accessdate=2009-05-30}}</ref> while Mitchell Schneider wrote a positive review in ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'', stating that he couldn't "remember the last time a record took such a hold of me<U+2014>and gave me such an extreme case of [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], too".<ref name="crawdaddy">{{cite journal |title=Brave New Eno:Before and After Science|year=1978 |month=May |journal=[[Crawdaddy!]] |issue=84|pages=64 |accessdate=2009-05-30 |quote=Brian Eno is an agent from some other time and some other place who seems to know something that we don't but should...I can't remember the last time a record took such a hold of me<U+2014>and gave such an extreme case of vertigo, too.)}}</ref> In ''[[Down Beat]]'', Russel Shaw wrote that "[''Before and after Science''] is another typically awesome, stunning and numbing Brian Eno album<U+2014>the record [[Pink Floyd]] ''could'' make if they set their collective mind to it."<ref name="downbeat">{{cite journal |title=Record Reviews: Before and After Science|issue=45|year=1978 |month=July |day=13|journal=[[Down Beat]] |pages=36 |accessdate=2009-05-30 |quote=What a wonderland of a zoo, a cross between steaming smoke, atonal mystery and hanging, frothy ditties...This is another typically awesome, stunning, numbing Brian Eno album<U+2014>the record Pink Floyd could make if they set their collective mind to it.)}}</ref> Tom Carson of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' noted that the album "is less immediately ingratiating than either ''[[Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)|Taking Tiger Mountain]]'' or ''[[Here Come the Warm Jets]]''. Still, the execution here is close to flawless, and despite Eno's eclecticism. the disparate styles he employs connect brilliantly."<ref name=rollingstone /> Critic [[Robert Christgau]] gave the album an A- rating, stating that he "didn't like the murkiness of the quiet, largely instrumental reflections that take over side two." but didn't find that it "diminishes side one's oblique, charming tour of the popular rhythms of the day".<ref name="Christgau">Christgau, 1990. p.127</ref> In 1979, ''Before and after Science'' was voted one of the best albums of the year in the ''[[Village Voice]]'''s [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll for 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pjres78.php|title= The 1978 Pazz & Jop Critics Poll  |accessdate=2009-05-31 |format= |work=[[Village Voice]] }}</ref>

Modern reviews of ''Before and after Science'' have also been positive. David Ross Smith of [[Allmusic]] awarded the album the highest rating of five stars stating that it ranks alongside ''[[Here Come the Warm Jets]]'' and ''[[Another Green World]]'' "as the most essential Eno material".<ref name=Allmusic /> The music [[webzine]] [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] awarded the album their highest rating, stating that it "is not only one of the best albums in Eno's catalog, but of the 1970s as a whole."<ref name="tinymix">{{cite web |url= http://www.tinymixtapes.com/Brian-Eno,5982|title= Brian Eno - Before and after Science - Delorian Reviews - Tiny Mix Tapes  |accessdate=2009-05-31 |format= |work=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]] }}</ref> The webzine [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] gave ''Before and After Science'' a positive, but less enthusiastic, review calling the album a "neutered star in search of fuel, boasting only "King's Lead Hat" for the pop world, and the luminous pure prog-jazz of "Energy Fools the Magician" for the out-rock contingent".<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web |url= http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11730-here-come-the-warm-jets-taking-tiger-mountain-by-strategy-another-green-world-before-and-after-science/|title= Pitchfork: Brian Eno: Here Come the Warm Jets / Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) / Another Green World / Before and After Science |date=June 13, 2004 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |format= |work=[[Pitchfork Media]] }}</ref> Ten days later Pitchfork placed ''Before and After Science'' at number one-hundred on their list of "Top 100 Albums of the 1970s" referring to it as a "lovely, charming album" and going on to state that, while "not formally groundbreaking, it's frequently overlooked when discussing great albums from an era that's romanticized as placing premiums on progression and innovation-and particularly in the context of Eno's career, which is so full of both".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5932-top-100-albums-of-the-1970s/|title=Pitchfork: Top 100 Albums of the 1970s |date=June 23, 2004 |accessdate=2009-05-31 |format= |work=[[Pitchfork Media]] }}</ref>
