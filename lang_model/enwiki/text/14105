'''Paul Gordon Goebel''' (born [[May 28]], [[1901]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] <U+2013> [[January 26]], [[1988]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]) was an [[American football]] [[End (American football)|end]] who played for the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]] from 1920-1922.  He was an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in 1921 and was the team<U+2019>s captain in 1922.  He played professional football from 1923-1926 with the [[Columbus Tigers]], [[Chicago Bears]], and [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]].  He was named to the [[National Football League|NFL]] [[All-Pro]] team in 1923 and 1924.  

After his football career ended, he operated a sporting good store in Grand Rapids.  He officiated football games for the [[Big Ten Conference]] for 16 years and also served in the [[U.S. Navy]] on an [[aircraft carrier]] in [[World War II]].  He was active in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politics in Grand Rapids, and was one of the organizers of a reform movement to oust the city<U+2019>s [[political boss]], Frank McKay.  As an anti-McKay reform candidate, Goebel was three times elected mayor of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] in the 1950s.  He was later elected to the [[University of Michigan]] Board of Regents, where he served from 1962-1970.

Goebel also played an important role in the career of [[U.S. President]] [[Gerald R. Ford]].  Goebel was friends with Ford<U+2019>s mother and stepfather and recommended Ford to head football coach [[Harry Kipke]] at the [[University of Michigan]].  When Ford returned from World War II, Goebel urged him to run for [[U.S. Congress]] and was part of the original Ford-for Congress committee.  Goebel was later the chairman of a committee formed in 1960 to name Ford as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]<U+2019>s [[U.S. Vice President|Vice Presidential]] candidate on the ticket with [[Richard Nixon]].

==Football player at the University of Michigan==
Goebel enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1919.<ref name=Bentley>{{cite web|title=All-American, 1921, Team Captain, 1922: Paul Goebel, Endl|url= http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fballam/aagoebel.htm | publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan}}</ref>  He studied [[engineering]] and received his degree in 1923.  While at Michigan, he played football under head coach [[Fielding H. Yost]].  He played at the [[End (American football)|end]] where he developed a reputation as one of the country<U+2019>s best [[forward pass]] receivers and as a tenacious defensive player.  At 6-feet, 3-inches, Goebel was a tall player in his era.  He started seven games in each of the 1920 and 1921 seasons at right [[End (American football)|end]] for the Wolverines, and was limited due to injury to five games in 1922.  In 1921, he was chosen as an All-American and was voted the captain of the 1922 team.<ref name=Bentley/><ref name=Madej/><ref name=Jersey/>  Goebel also excelled as an honor student in the University<U+2019>s engineering school.<ref name=Bentley/><ref name=Coach/>  Goebel also earned the Big Ten Conference Medal of Honor for proficiency in academics and athletics.<ref name=Madej>{{cite book|author=Madej, Bruce|title=Michigan: Champions of the West, p. 53|publisher=Sport Publishing LCC|date=1997|isbn= 1571671153}}</ref>  

===Goebel<U+2019>s steel knee brace===
Prior to the 1922 season, Goebel <U+201C>threw out his knee<U+201D> and was fitted with a steel hinge <U+2013> an early version of a knee brace.<ref name=Hinge/>  However, the steel contraption required oiling and overheated when the oil dried, thus limiting Goebel<U+2019>s ability to play a complete game in 1922.  One 1922 newspaper article described Goebel<U+2019>s knee brace this way: <U+201C>To enable Goebel to play, the Michigan trainers devised a steel brace <U+2013> a hinge.  This apparatus attached above and below the knee gave Goebel fairly good leg action because of the hinge.  Before each game, Goebel liberally oiled the hinge to get free action because of the hinge.<U+201D><ref name=Hinge>{{cite news|title=Knee Brace Lacks Oil; Player Quits|publisher=Modesto Evening News|date=1922-12-12}}</ref>  Goebel<U+2019>s playing time was limited because <U+201C>the constant action would dry the oil and then the steel would become so hot that Goebel could not continue playing.<U+201D><ref name=Hinge/>  During the 1922 game against [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]], Goebel<U+2019>s skin was burned by the steel.<ref name=Hinge/>

===Goebel ruins <U+201C>Dedication Day<U+201D> at Ohio Stadium===
Despite the limitations of the knee brace, Goebel led the Wolverines to victory in the first game played at [[Ohio Stadium]].  The official <U+201C>Dedication Day<U+201D> for the stadium was October 21, 1922, and the opponent was Michigan.  Ohio State fans recalled for years afterward how Goebel and his teammate [[Harry Kipke]] managed to turn Dedication Day sour for the Buckeyes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ohio Stadium Dedication Day|url=http://www.wosu.org/archive/horseshoe/memories.htm}}</ref>   Michigan shut out the Buckeyes, 19-0, with Goebel and Kipke scoring all the points.  In the first period, Goebel blocked a punt and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game<U+2019>s first points.  He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble.<ref name=Evans>{{cite news|author=Evans, Billy|title=Michigan Boasts Two Great Stars|publisher=The Star Publications (Chicago)|1927-05-03}}</ref>  As the game wore on,  the Buckeyes <U+201C>seemed to realize (Goebel<U+2019>s) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment.<U+201D><ref name=Evans/>  Football writer Billy Evans described Goebel<U+2019>s performance against Ohio State this way: <blockquote><U+201C>No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State.  For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of the Michigan eleven.  He seemed to be in every play.  It was always Goebel who was gumming things up for State.  No man could go through an entire game at the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters.  It was beyond the power of any human being.  With a few minutes to play in the third period the big fellow practically collapsed.  Even when three or four of his teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there.  He tried to induce his teammates that he was able to play, and tried to break away from their grasp, but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way as the big crowd cheered him to the echo.  If any one man made possible the defeat of State by Michigan, it was Captain Paul Goebel.<U+201D><ref name=Evans/> </blockquote> The rotunda at Ohio Stadium is painted with maize flowers on a blue background due to the outcome of the 1922 dedication game against, an enduring tribute to Goebel's performance that day.<ref>[http://www.swerbsblurbs.com/article_detail.php?id=1010 The Five Greatest Traditions Of Ohio State Football], by Mike Furlan.  Retrieved on November 20, 2006.</ref>  Another writer summed up Goebel<U+2019>s 1922 season: <U+201C>Captain Paul Goebel of Michigan has commanded no little attention this season.  He is fast and furious.  His particular forte lies in his ability to not only plunge in and break up the interference of the opposing team, but after so doing, nail the man with the ball and down him in his tracks.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news|title=A Few of the Shining Lights of the Gridiron this Season |publisher=Capital Times (Madison, Wisc.)|1922-12-05}}</ref>

===The tradition of the #1 jersey at Michigan===
Goebel was particularly adept as a pass receiver.  A 1923 wire service report in the ''Capital Times'' noted that Goebel was <U+201C>considered one of the best ends in the country and his work on receiving forward passes hasn<U+2019>t been excelled on the gridiron.<U+201D><ref name=Coach/>  In what would become a tradition at Michigan 60 years later, Goebel was the first All-American receiver at Michigan to wear the #1 jersey.<ref name=Jersey>{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Football All-Americans by Jersey Number|url=http://mgoblue.com/football/article.aspx?id=40334|publisher=University of Michigan & Host Interactive}}</ref>  Others to follow that tradition are [[Anthony Carter (American football)|Anthony Carter]], [[Derrick Alexander (wide receiver)|Derrick Alexander]], [[David Terrell]], and [[Braylon Edwards]].<ref name=Jersey/>

===The death of Bernard Kirk===
Across the field from right end Goebel, Bernard Kirk played left end for the Wolverines in 1921 and 1922.  Kirk was a talented player who was set to graduate with Goebel in 1923.  However, Kirk died in an automobile accident on December 17, 1922.  Goebel was a pall-bearer along with [[Harry Kipke]], [[Frank Steketee]], and other Michigan football players at Kirk<U+2019>s funeral in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]].  Kirk had been a popular figure, and his funeral was covered widely in the national press, with [[Michigan Governor]] [[Alex Groesbeck]], U-M President [[Marion LeRoy Burton]], and the coaches of the [[Big Ten Conference]] football teams all in attendance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Team Mates Sob at Kirk Funeral: Eight Michigan Stars Carry Body to Grave|publisher=[[Decatur Daily Review|Decatur Review]]|date=1922-12-27|accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bernard Kirk Is Buried While Team-Mates Weep|publisher=The LaCrosse Tribune|1922-12-27}}</ref>

Goebel also served years later as a pall bearer at the funeral of his coach, [[Fielding Yost]], in August 1946.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fitting Ceremonies Mark Yost Service|publisher=The Morning Herald (Uniontown, Pa.)(AP)|1946-08-23}}</ref>

==Professional football==
In February 1923, Goebel refused an offer to become the head football coach at [[Wichita State University]] (then known as Fairmount College), saying he planned to enter the engineering profession after graduation.<ref name=Coach>{{cite news|title=Wolverine Grid Leader refuses Head Coach Job: Paul Goebel|publisher=Capital Times (Madison, Wisc.)|date=1923-02-26}}</ref>  Instead, Goebel opted to play professional football.  He played professional football for the [[Columbus Tigers]] from 1923-1925, the [[Chicago Bears]] in 1925, and the [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]] (the football team) in 1926.<ref name=Madej/><ref name=Retires>{{cite news|title=Paul Goebel Will Not Run|publisher=The Holland, Michigan Evening Sentinel|date=1970-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=All-Time Roster - Chicago Bears|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/alltimeroster.asp#g}}</ref>  In his first year in the NFL, Goebel played in all ten of the team's games for the [[Columbus Tigers]] and was named to the All-Pro Team.<ref name=Pro>{{cite web|title=Profile of Paul Goebel|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/G/GoebPa20.htm|publisher=pro-football-reference.com}}</ref>   He threw one touchdown pass and caught another.  He was credited with eight points scored including two extra points.<ref name=Pro/> <ref name=Total>{{cite book| author=Carroll, Bob| title=Total Football II, p. 831| publisher=Harper Collins|date=1999| isbn=0060392320}}</ref> 

In 1924, Goebel was again selected as an All-Pro player with the Tigers, playing in ten games, making two touchdown receptions, and returning a fumble for a touchdown.  In all, he was credited with three touchdowns and 18 points in 1924.<ref name=Pro/><ref name=Total/>  While playing end for the Columbus Tigers in 1924, Goebel was involved in one of the oddest plays in NFL history.  Goebel was the intended receiver of a forward pass, but the ball popped out of his arms and was snatched out of the air by Oscar Knop of the [[Chicago Bears]].  Knop began running for the goal line with the ball, but he was running the wrong way toward a safety. After running 30 yards, Knop was caught from behind and tackled by his teammate [[Ed Healey]] on the four-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chicago Bears History: Ed Healey|url= http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/hof-healey.asp|publisher=Chicago Bears}}</ref>

In 1926, Goebel played for the Yankees alongside [[Red Grange]].  After the close of the 1926 football season, he went to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] where he took a minor role in Grange<U+2019>s latest film.<ref name=Star>{{cite news|title=Paul Goebel Says His Football Career Ended|publisher=The Star Publications (Chicago)|1927-05-03}}</ref>  In May 1927, Goebel announced his retirement from professional football.  He said he would devote his time to the sporting goods store he operated in Grand Rapids.  Goebel had been playing professional football every season since he finished at Michigan.<ref name=Star/>

==Football official and sporting good businessman==
After retiring from professional football, Goebel worked in his sporting good business in Grand Rapids, and also worked during football season as a game official for the [[Big Ten Conference]].  For 16 years from 1935-1952, he was a Big Ten football official.<ref name=Bentley/><ref name=Madej/><ref name=Retires/><ref name=HOF/>  He also officiated in Rose Bowl, Notre Dame, and Army-Navy games.<ref name=Speaks>{{cite news|title=Paul Goebel Speaks Here On Thursday|The Holland Evening Sentinel|date=1965-01-20}}</ref>

Goebel played a role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943.  The game was [[Paul Brown]]<U+2019>s last game as coach of the Buckeyes.<ref name=Patterson/>   With the score tied 26-26, Ohio State threw an incomplete [[forward pass]] into the [[end zone]] as the gun sounded.  The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied.  However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty.<ref name=Patterson/>  On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket.  Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides.  Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29-26 win in his final game.<ref name=Patterson>{{cite book|author=Patterson, Ted|title=The Golden Voices of Football, pp. 70-71|publisher=Sport Publishing|date=2004|isbn=1582617449}}</ref>

During World War II, he served in the [[U.S. Navy]] as [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] on an [[aircraft carrier]].<ref name=Bentley/><ref>{{cite news|title=On Other Fields|publisher=Waterloo Daily Courier|1945-02-26}}</ref>  His final game as an official was the 1952 Rose Bowl between Illinois and Stanford, in which he was the head linesman. <ref>{{cite news|title=Barnum Refs In Rose Bowl|publisher=Long Beach Press-Telegram|1951-12-16}}</ref>

Goebel was also a fisherman, winning the title of Trout King at the National Trout Festival in 1949.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kalkaska Host to Thousands at Festival|publisher=Record-Eagle (Traverse City)|date=1949-04-30}}</ref>

==Relationship with Gerald R. Ford==
[[Image:Gerald Ford on field at Univ of Mich, 1933.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Goebel played a key role in the football and political career of Gerald Ford, pictured in 1933 in Ann Arbor'']]
Goebel was a friend of [[Gerald R. Ford]]<U+2019>s mother and stepfather in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]].<ref name=Cannon>{{cite book|author=Cannon, James|title=Time and Chance: Gerald Ford<U+2019>s Appointment with History, pp. 32-33|publisher=University of Michigan Press|date=1998|isbn=0472084828}}</ref>  Goebel played an important role in guiding Ford to the [[University of Michigan]].  When Ford graduated from high school in Grand Rapids, Goebel recognized Ford<U+2019>s ability as a [[American football|football]] player and recommended him to his former teammate [[Harry Kipke]], who had taken over as Michigan<U+2019>s head football coach.<ref name=Wolfan>{{cite news|author=Wolfan, W.B.|title=From Island Park to White House|publisher=The Times Recorder (UPI Wire Service)|date=1975-12-07}}</ref>  Kipke recruited Ford, who became Michigan's Most Valuable Player in 1934.<ref name=Wolfan/>

In 1940, Goebel was part of  a citizen<U+2019>s group in Grand Rapids seeking to overthrow Grand Rapids' [[political boss]], Frank McKay.  McKay had dismissed Ford<U+2019>s political interest in 1940, and this led to a long political alliance between Goebel and Ford.<ref name=Cannon/> Ford went to work with Goebel as part of the anti-McKay citizen<U+2019>s group.  Together, they organized the "Home Front," the purpose of which was to throw out Boss McKay.  Ford was elected president of the organization, his first experience in political organizing.<ref name=Cannon/>   

Ford and Goebel both served in the [[U.S. Navy]] during World War II, and after the war, Ford urged Goebel to run for [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] against the incumbent, an isolationist named Barney Jonkman.  Goebel declined to run, but suggested to Ford that, <U+201C>if you think he ought to be beaten, why don<U+2019>t you run?<U+201D><ref name=Cannon>{{cite book|author=Cannon, James|title=Time and Chance: Gerald Ford<U+2019>s Appointment with History, p. 45|publisher=University of Michigan Press|date=1998|isbn=0472084828}}</ref>  Ford did run for Congress in 1948, and Goebel was one of his close circle of early supporters, the original Ford-for-Congress group.<ref name=Horst>{{cite book||author=terHorst, J.F.|title=Gerald Ford and the future of the presidence|publisher=The Third Press|date=1974|isbn=)-89388-191-O}}</ref>  Ford won the election and won re-election for twelve more terms.<ref name=Cannon/>  In 1960, Goebel was a leader in the movement to nominate Ford as the [[U.S. Vice President|Vice Presidential]] candidate on the ticket with [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]], serving as Chairman of the <U+201C>Ford for Vice President Committee<U+201D> at the [[Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ford Opens Headquarters At Chicago GOP Convention|publisher=The Holland Evening Sentinel (UPI)|date=1960-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=GOP Seeking Support for Ford for V-P|publisher= Record-Eagle (Traverse City) (UPI )|date=1960-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.

When Goebel<U+2019>s son, Paul G. Goebel, Jr., ran for Ford<U+2019>s Congressional seat in 1974, then President Ford returned to Grand Rapids to campaign for Goebel<U+2019>s son.<ref name=Calvin/>  Ford delivered a speech at [[Calvin College]] in Grand Rapids the week before the election in which he said: <U+201C>Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when I was back at South High--an inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are the kind of people who are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is.   And I have seen nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family.<U+201D><ref name=Calvin>{{cite web| title=Gerald R.

==Political career==
===Mayor of Grand Rapids===
Goebel himself ran for office in 1950.  He ran for mayor of Grand Rapids as part of the same anti-McKay reform movement that brought Gerald Ford to office.<ref name=Horst/>   According to one newspaper account, Goebel <U+201C>spearheaded a reform movement which brought him into office in 1950,<U+201D> ousting incumbent George W. Welsh, who had been elected mayor five times and also served as the state<U+2019>s lieutenant governor.<ref name=Politics>{{cite news|title=Paul Goebel to Quit Politics|publisher=Record Eagle (Traverse City)(UP)|date=1953-10-15}}</ref>  At the time, Goebel was the partner in a sporting goods store and was described in the press as tall and rangy, a candidate <U+201C>who looks like a blond Abraham Lincoln without a beard.<U+201D><ref name=Politics/>  Goebel was re-elected in 1952 for a second two-year term.<ref name=Politics/>  In October 1953, Goebel announced he would not run for a third term, saying he had no further political ambitions and would devote his time to his family and business.<ref name=Politics/>  Within a short time, however, he changed his mind and ran for a third term with the support of the reformist Citizens Action Group.   In February 1954, Goebel received the most votes of any candidate in his third race for mayor (19,564 for Goebel to 10,831 for George Veldman), but he failed to secure a majority, and a runoff was held.<ref>{{cite news|title=Goebel, Others Facing Runoffs|publisher=The Holland Evening Sentinenl (UP)|date=1954-02-16}}</ref>  Veldman defeated Goebel in the runoff by a margin of 203 votes.

===University of Michigan Board of Regents===
In 1962, Goebel returned to politics, winning a seat on the [[Board of Regents of the University of Michigan]], where he served from 1962-1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Regents of the University of Michigan, 1837-2003|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(f30uyd55coz4uy45w4dpy055))/documents/publications/manual/2003-2004/2003-mm-0701-0703-UMRegent.pdf|publisher=State of Michigan}}</ref>  In 1968, the Regents voted to eliminate curfews for all women students in residence halls and to allow each housing unit to set its own visitation hours. Goebel was the sole dissenter, saying: "If my judgment is proved wrong, no one will be happier than I."<ref>{{cite web|author=Tobin, James|title=The day in loco parentis died|url=http://michigantoday.umich.edu/2007/nov/dorms.php|publisher=University of Michigan: Michigan Today|date=2007-11}}</ref>  In July 1970, Goebel announced that he would retire from the Regents at the end of his term on December 31, 1970.  At age 69, he said the expected strain of another campaign influenced his decision.<ref name=Retires/>
