'''Varghese Palakkappillil''' ({{lang-ml|<U+0D35><U+0D30><U+0D4D><U+200D><U+0D17><U+0D40><U+0D38><U+0D4D> <U+0D2A><U+0D3E><U+0D32><U+0D2F><U+0D4D><U+0D15><U+0D4D><U+0D15><U+0D3E><U+0D2A><U+0D4D><U+0D2A><U+0D3F><U+0D33><U+0D4D><U+0D33><U+0D3F><U+0D32><U+0D4D><U+200D>}}) was the founder of the Congregation of the [[Sisters of the Destitute]]. He is widely known as ''Fr. Varghese Payyappilly''.

==Family==
Varghese Palakkappillil was born as Kunjuvaru on August 8, 1876, at Perumanoor, [[Kerala]] to Palakkappillil Lonan and Kunjumariam. He hails from a noble, rather rich and good Christian family of [[Palakkappillil]] (also known as Palackapilly or Payyappilly) which is a [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] family spread mainly in central districts of Kerala.<ref>[http://tripatlas.com/Palakkappillil Palakkappillil]</ref>

Palakkappillil, an ancient [[Syro-Malabar|Syrian Catholic]] family, based at Perumanoor had two plots namely Payyappilly and Illathuparambu. Fr. Varghese was from the Payyappilly plot and hence he came to be known as Varghese Payyappilly though his actual surname is Palakkappillil. Payyappilly is his plot name and is not to be mistaken as his family name which is Palakkappillil. His full name as in his [[will (law)|will]] is '''Illathuparambilirikkum Payyappillilaya Palakkappillil Varghese Kathanar'''.

His parents had five children. They were Thoma, Kunjulonan, Korah, Kunjautha and Fr. Varghese. His other relatives were very learned and were occupying important positions in the society and some of them even had received honorary titles from the King of Kochi.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} But his parents were of a very simple and straightforward nature. In a family richly blessed with vocations that he had the fortune to grow up. His father<U+2019>s brother as well another paternal cousin were already priests.
