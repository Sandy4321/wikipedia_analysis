{{Mongol conquest of Burma}}

The '''first Mongol invasions of Burma''' (Myanmar) ({{lang-my|<U+1019><U+103D><U+1014><U+103A><U+1002><U+102D><U+102F><U+2013><U+1019><U+103C><U+1014><U+103A><U+1019><U+102C> <U+1005><U+1005><U+103A> (<U+1041><U+1042><U+1047><U+1047><U+2013><U+1041><U+1042><U+1048><U+1047>)}}) were a series of military conflicts between the [[Mongol Empire]] and the [[Pagan Empire]] that took place between 1277 and 1287. The invasions toppled the 250-year-old Pagan Empire, and the [[Mongol Army]] seized Pagan territories in present-day [[Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture|Dehong, Yunnan]] and northern Burma to [[Tagaung, Mandalay|Tagaung]]. The invasions ushered in [[History of Burma#Small kingdoms|250 years of political fragmentation]] in Burma, and the rise of [[Tai peoples|Tai-Shan]] states throughout [[mainland Southeast Asia]].

The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271<U+2013>72, as part of their drive to encircle the [[Song dynasty]] of China. When King [[Narathihapate]] refused, Emperor [[Kublai Khan]] himself sent another mission in 1273, again demanding tribute. It too was rejected. In 1275, the emperor ordered the Yunnan government to secure the borderlands in order to block an escape path for the Song, and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested. Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the Mongol Army in 1277<U+2013>78. After a brief lull, Kublai Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia, demanding tribute from Pagan, the [[Khmer Empire]], [[<U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t]] and [[Champa]]. When the Burmese king again refused, the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma. Two dry season campaigns (1283<U+2013>85) later, the Mongols had occupied down to Tagaung and [[Hanlin, Burma|Hanlin]], forcing the Burmese king to flee to Lower Burma. The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of Zhengmian.

Ceasefire negotiations began in 1285, and ended with Narathihapate finally agreeing to submit in June 1286. The Burmese embassy, received by the emperor in Beijing in January 1287, agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the suzerainty of the Mongol Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the Yunnan government in exchange for the evacuation of Mongol troops from northern Burma. But the treaty never really took effect as Narathihapate was assassinated in July 1287, and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged. The Mongol command at Yunnan now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void, and ordered an invasion of central Burma. They may not have reached Pagan, and even if they did, after having suffered heavy casualties, they returned to Tagaung.

The Pagan Empire disintegrated and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, who probably preferred the situation, did nothing to restore order in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King [[Kyawswa of Pagan]] although he controlled little beyond the capital city of [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their [[Second Mongol invasion of Burma|second invasion]] in 1300<U+2013>01.

[[Marco Polo]] reported the first invasions (1277<U+2013>87) in his travelogue, ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]''. The Burmese referred to the invaders as the Taruk (after the central Asian [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] troops that largely made up the Mongol invasion army); today, the term Taruk ({{my|<U+1010><U+101B><U+102F><U+1010><U+103A>}}) in Burmese refers to the [[Han Chinese]] instead. King Narathihapate is unkindly remembered in [[History of Burma|Burmese history]] as Taruk-Pye Min, ("the King who Fled from the Taruk [Chinese]").

==Background==
===Pagan and Dali===
[[File:Pagan Empire -- Sithu II.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Pagan Empire during Sithu II's reign. Burmese chronicles also claim Kengtung and Chiang Mai. Core areas shown in darker yellow. Peripheral areas in light yellow.]]
[[File:China 11b.jpg|thumb|Dali Kingdom c. mid-12th century]]
In the 13th century, the [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan Empire]], along with the [[Khmer Empire]], was one of the two main empires in [[mainland Southeast Asia]].<ref name=vbl-24>Lieberman 2003: 24</ref> For much of its history, Pagan's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent kingdom of [[Dali Kingdom|Dali]] and its predecessor [[Nanzhao]], both with [[Dali City|Dali]] as their capital. Dali-based kingdoms were a power in their own right, at times allying themselves with the Tibetan Empire to their west, at times with China's [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] dynasties. Indeed, Nanzhao's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Myanmar and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of [[Bagan|Pagan]] (Bagan) and the Pagan Dynasty itself.<ref name=tmu-2011-165>Myint-U 2011: 165</ref> Between the newly conquered Mongol territory and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands, which stretched from present-day [[Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture|Dehong]], [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]] and [[Lincang]] prefectures in [[Yunnan]] as well as the [[Wa people|Wa]] and [[Palaung people|Palaung]] regions (presumably in present-day northern [[Shan State]]),<ref group=note>Burmese sources per (Than Tun 1964: 136) simply refer to Wa and Palaung regions. It is unclear if the regions in the 13th century were located in the same [[Wa Self-Administered Division|Wa]] and [[Pa Laung Self-Administered Zone|Palaung regions]] of the present-day. According to Marco Polo (Yule 1874: 81) (Haw 2006: 104), Pagan attacked Zardandan or the Gold Teeth state in 1272; if it is true, the Wa and Palaung regions may have been the same as the Gold Teeth region in present-day Dehong and Baoshan prefectures.</ref> which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence.<ref name=tt-136>Than Tun 1964: 136</ref> Then as now, the borderlands mostly consist of forbidding terrains of high mountain ranges.<ref name=tmu-2011-173>Myint-U 2011: 173</ref>

===Mongol conquest of Dali===
The [[Mongol Empire]] first arrived at the doorstep of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom, in its attempt to outflank the [[Song Dynasty]]. The Mongol armies captured the capital Dali on 7 January 1253, and went on to pacify much of the kingdom by 1257.<ref name=gc-190>Coedes 1968: 190</ref> The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the borderlands as the Mongols were intent on [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|finishing up the Song]]. For the next dozen years, they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land, which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India. The Mongols set up military garrisons, manned mostly by [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking Muslims from [[central Asia]], in 37 [[Circuit (administrative division)|circuits]] of the former Dali Kingdom.<ref name=mr-289>Rossabi 2014: 289</ref>

===Decline of Pagan===
By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward appearances of calm, had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges.<ref name=vbl-119-120>Lieberman 2003: 119<U+2013>120</ref> Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258<U+2013>60 in [[Kyaukpyu District|South Arakan]] and [[Mottama|Martaban]] (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.<ref name=vbl-119-120/>

==Prelude to war==
[[File:Bagan, Burma.jpg|thumb|Pagan plains today]]
===First Mongol mission (1271<U+2013>72)===
The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early 1270s. By then, the Song were on the ropes, and Emperor [[Kublai Khan]], who officially founded the [[Yuan Dynasty]] on 18 December 1271, sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions.<ref name=krh-255>Hall 255</ref> In Pagan's case, he ordered the Mongol governor of Dali to tighten control of the borderlands, and to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute.<ref name=geh-64>Harvey 1925: 64</ref> The tribute he demanded was nominal. Given his higher priority preoccupations elsewhere, the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan.<ref name=geh-64/> At the border, the ruler of Wa and Palaung regions submitted to the Mongols.<ref name=tt-136/>

When the Mongol envoys showed up, the Pagan court led by Chief Minister [[Ananda Pyissi]] was well aware of the military power of the Mongols, and advised King [[Narathihapate]] to use diplomacy. The king was furious at the demand, and kept the Mongol envoys waiting for weeks. The court finally devised a compromise: the envoys were sent back, without ever seeing the king, with a Burmese envoy who carried a letter, expressing friendly sentiments and the Burmese king's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing.<ref name=geh-64/> The king then promptly ordered an expedition, which retook the rebellious borderland regions in 1272. The rebel leader A-Pi (<U+1021><U+1015><U+102D>) was brought back to Pagan. Dali relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action.<ref name=tt-136/>

===Second Mongol mission (1273)===
At Beijing, Kublai Khan, who was preparing an invasion of Japan, decided against a war with Pagan, for the time being. On 3 March 1273, he sent a 4-member delegation led by an imperial ambassador, the First Secretary to the Board Rites, to Pagan.<ref name=tt-136/><ref name=geh-64/> The delegation carried a letter from the emperor. The letter says:<ref name=geh-64/>
:''"If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All-Highest, send one of your brothers or senior ministers, to show men that all the world is linked with Us, and enter into a perpetual alliance. This will add to your reputation, and be in your own interests; for if it comes to war, who will be the victor? Ponder well, O king, Our words."''

This time, the Burmese king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit. The [[Burmese chronicles]] say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed,<ref name=hy-1-352>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 352</ref> but inscriptional evidence indicates that the envoys were not executed.<ref name=tt-136/> At any rate, the imperial envoys never got back to Yunnan. They may have been assassinated in Yunnan on their way back to China. The newly formed Yunnan government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation, but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route.<ref name=gc-193>Coedes 1968: 193</ref>

===Mongol consolidation of borderlands (1275<U+2013>76)===
Meanwhile, in 1274, the former Dali Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of Yunnan, with [[Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar]] as governor.<ref group=note>(Myint-U 2011: 172): Ajjall's official title was "Director of Political Affairs of the Regional Secretariat of Yunnan."</ref> In the following year, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward.<ref name=tt-136/><ref name=geh-65>Harvey 1925: 65</ref>

But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. Focused on delivering the final blow against the Song, the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan decided to contest the takeover.<ref name=krh-255/><ref name=geh-65/> As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275<U+2013>76. (Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276.) 
By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named "Gold Teeth" (modern [[Yingjiang County|Yingjiang]]) had submitted to the Mongols.<ref group=note>(Haw 2006: 104): Marco Polo called the state as Zardandan, Persian for Gold Teeth. According to the Burmese records, it seems to be the same Wa and Palaung states where the Army had put down a rebellion in 1272.</ref> Like in 1272, the Burmese government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state; but unlike in 1272, the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there.<ref name=tt-136/><ref name=geh-65/> Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were [[Turkic languages|Turkic-speaking]] peoples or people from the further west: [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] from [[Samarkand]], [[Bukhara]], [[Merv]] and [[Nishapur]], but also captive soldiers from the Persian [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmid empire]], the [[Kipchaks]], and even [[Bulgars]] from the lower [[Volga]].<ref name=tmu-2011-171>Myint-U 2011: 171</ref>

==Border war (1277<U+2013>78)==
[[File:Mongol invasions of Burma (1277-87).png|thumb|300px|left|Mongol invasions 1277<U+2013>87]]
[[File:MongolArcher.jpg|thumb|Mongol mounted archer]]

What followed was a border war in 1277<U+2013>78. It was reported mainly in the Yuan Dynasty chronicle and the [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travelogue of Marco Polo]].<ref group=note>(Harvey 1925: 65): Marco Polo, who served a Privy Councillor on the Emperor's staff, claimed to have witnessed the war but he "doubtless heard the tale from the officers who took part in the action."</ref> Although the [[Burmese chronicles]] have no record of the border war, a 1278 Burmese inscription mentions the army's defeat at Ngasaunggyan.<ref name=tt-136/> The Mongol accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate.<ref group=note>(Haw 2006: 104): The Yuan account of the war seems "far-fetched". (Turnbull 2003: 84): Marco Polo's description of the battle in 1277 "actually compresses a decade of history into one episode, and contains certain errors of location and numbers, but the overall impression of what happened is probably quite accurate." (Harvey 1925: 336): Regarding the battle of Ngasaunggyan, "Marco Polo catches the spirit of it all but his details need modification."</ref>

===Battle of Ngasaunggyan===
{{main|Battle of Ngasaunggyan}}

According to the Yuan Dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo's accounts, a Burmese army "invaded" the Mongol territory of Gold Teeth, and was defeated by the Mongol army in April 1277. The battle took place either at the Vochang valley (in present-day [[Baoshan Prefecture]]) or 110 km southwest at Kanngai (present-day [[Yingjiang County|Yingjiang]], [[Dehong Prefecture]]), which the Burmese called ''Ngasaunggyan''.<ref group=note>Some historians such as Stephen Haw (Haw 2006: 104) accept Marco Polo's account. But others such as G.E. Harvey (Harvey 1925: 336<U+2013>337) believe the Burmese army never made it to Vochang, and was stopped en route at Ngasaunggyan, which according to Harvey was about 110 km southwest of Vochang.</ref>

The Yuan Chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a Burmese army of 40,000 to 50,000 with 10,000 horses and 800 elephants. It also reports only one Mongol was killed, in trying to catch an elephant.<ref name=sgh-104>Haw 2006: 104</ref><ref name=geh-65-67>Harvey 1925: 65<U+2013>67</ref> According to Marco Polo, the Mongol army consisted of 12,000 mounted archers, and the Burmese army numbered 60,000 men with 2000 elephants, "on each of which was set a tower of timber, well-framed and strong, and carrying from 12 to 16 well-armed fighting men."<ref name=sgh-104/><ref name=tmu-2006-60-61>Myint-U 2006: 60<U+2013>61</ref> Even then, the 40,000 to 60,000 figures of the Burmese army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high; the Mongols may have erred "on the side of generosity" not to "diminish their glory in defeating superior numbers."<ref name=geh-333>Harvey 1925: 333</ref>

According to Marco Polo's account, in the early stages of the battle, the Turkish and Mongol horsemen "took such fright at the sight of the elephants that they would not be got to face the foe, but always swerved and turned back," while the Burmese forces pressed on. But the Mongol commander Huthukh<ref group=note>(Harvey 1925: 336): Marco Polo's account that Nasr al-Din commanded the Mongol army at the battle of Ngasaunggyan is incorrect. Nasr al-Din led the raid on Kaungsin in the following dry-season. According to (Yule 1874: 87), the initial 1277 expedition was led by the Commandant of Dali-fu, Huthukh, which may refer to Kutuka.</ref> did not panic; he ordered his troops to dismount, and from the cover of the nearby treeline, aim their bows directly at the advancing elephants. The Mongol archers' arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled.<ref name=tmu-2006-60-61/> 

===Raid of Kaungsin===
The Mongol army pressed on after the monsoon season. In the following dry season of 1277<U+2013>78, c. December 1277, a Mongol army of 3800 led by [[Nasr al-Din (Yunnan)|Nasr al-Din]], son of Gov. Sayyid Ajjal, advanced to Kaungsin, which defended the [[Bhamo|Bhamo Pass]].<ref name=gc-193/><ref name=hy-87>Yule 1874: 87</ref> They occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned stockades. But they found the heat excessive and returned.<ref name=geh-67>Harvey 1925: 67</ref>

==Interlude (1278<U+2013>83)==
Despite the Mongol military success, the control of the borderlands remained contested. Pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions, and the Burmese, apparently taking advantage of Mongol preoccupations elsewhere, rebuilt their forts at Kaungsin and Ngasaunggyan later in 1278, posting permanent garrisons commanded by Einda Pyissi.<ref name=tt-1964-277>(Than Tun 1964: 277): Einda Pyissaya or Einda Pyissi</ref> But their control was short-lived. The Great Khan's attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in 1281.<ref name=gc-192>Coedes 1968: 192</ref> He had had mixed success: his vaunted forces had finished off the last of the Song in 1279 but had again failed to take Japan in 1281. That year, the Mongol emperor sent another mission to Pagan, demanding tribute yet again. The Burmese king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor's court.<ref name=hy-1-351>Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 351</ref> (With Champa, the emperor summoned the king of Champa himself to Beijing.<ref name=gc-192>Coedes 1968: 192</ref>)

At Pagan, Narathihapate deliberated with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit. The Burmese court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma.<ref name=gc-193/> (He also ordered an invasion of Champa, whose king too had refused to submit.<ref name=gc-192/>) The Burmese king's  troubles did not go unnoticed elsewhere in the kingdom. In the same year, a usurper named [[Wareru]] seized the southern port city of [[Mottama|Martaban]] (Mottama) by killing its Pagan-appointed governor. Although the king's three sons were viceroys of the nearby Lower Burma cities (in [[Pathein|Bassein]] (Pathein), [[Pyay|Prome]] (Pyay), and [[Dala township|Dala]]), the king, preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north, did not (or could not) take any action on Martaban.<ref name=hy-1-351/>

Throughout 1282, the Mongol command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of Champa and northern Burma. The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further; the emperor did not sanction an attack on Pagan itself.<ref name=geh-68>Harvey 1925: 68</ref> At least one army consisted of 14,000 men of the erstwhile Persian [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmid Empire]] under the command of Yalu Beg was sent to Yunnan to reinforce the Burma invasion force, which again was made up of Turks and other central Asians.<ref name=tmu-2011-171/> On the Burmese side, the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals, he probably could not have raised a large one. By mid-1283, a Burmese army led by generals Ananda Pyissi and Yanda Pyissi was deployed at a fort at Ngasaunggyan.<ref name=hy-1-352/>

==Invasion (1283<U+2013>85)==
[[File:MongolCavalrymen.jpg|thumb|200px|Mongol cavalry archery using the [[Mongol bow]].]]

===Battle of Ngasaunggyan (1283)===
The invasion began on 22 September 1283. Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief of the invasion force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin.<ref name=yt-1-147-fn3>Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 147, footnote 3</ref> The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the [[Taping River]] using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan.<ref name=swc-24-25>Cocks 1919: 24<U+2013>25</ref> The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.)<ref name=hy-1-352/> The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283.<ref name=tt-136/><ref name=gc-193/>

===Invasion of northern Burma===
The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort inline, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283.<ref name=gc-194>Coed<U+00E8>s 1968: 194</ref> The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin.<ref name=geh-67/> The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of [[Tagaung, Mandalay|Tagaung]], about 380 km north of Pagan, in January 1284.<ref name=gc-194/> There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284.<ref name=mat-1985-195>Aung-Thwin 1985: 195</ref> But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near [[Hanlin, Burma|Hanlin]], on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south.<ref name=yt-1-148-7>(Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 148, footnote 7): 5th waning of Tabodwe 646 ME = 26 January 1285</ref><ref name=tt-2002-66>Than Tun 2002: 66</ref> After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma.<ref name=gc-194/> The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan.<ref name=geh-68/>

The country fell into chaos. In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack. Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports (Prome, Dala and Bassein), the king did not trust any of them, and he and his court settled at Hlegya, west of Prome.<ref name=yt-1-148-10>Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 148, footnote 10</ref> Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army scared no one. The governor of [[Bago, Burma|Pegu]] revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed. Now, the entire eastern half of Lower Burma (Pegu and Martaban) was in open revolt.<ref name=npl-28-29>Pan Hla 2005: 28<U+2013>29</ref>

==Peace negotiations (1285<U+2013>87)==
[[File:YuanEmperorAlbumKhubilaiPortrait.jpg|thumb|Kublai Khan, Founder and Emperor of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]]]
===Ceasefire===
Given his precarious position, Narathihapate decided to buy time, and sue for peace with the Mongols.<ref name=msf-88-90>Stuart-Fox 2001: 88<U+2013>90</ref> In December 1285,<ref name=mat-1985-195/> the king ordered his generals Ananda Pyissi and Maha Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations.<ref group=note>Burmese chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 354) say that [[Ananda Pyissi]] died in action during the 1283<U+2013>84 campaign. Per (Than Tun 1964: 136), Ananda Pyissi was still alive in 1285 according to a contemporary inscription. The general who died may have been Ananda Pyissi's brother [[Yanda Pyissi]] since Gen. Maha Bo presumably had become the second in command in 1285.</ref> The Mongol commanders at Hanlin, who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named Zhengmian ({{zh|t=<U+5F81><U+7DEC>|w=Cheng-Mien}}),<ref group=note>[[Wade-Giles]] transcription per (Than Tun 1959: 121); (Htin Aung 1967: 70) gives it as Chiang-Mien, "the Burmese province".</ref>  agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission. They repeated their 1281 demand that the Burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor.<ref name=tt-136/><ref name=gc-194/> After a long deliberation, in June 1286, the Burmese king decided to agree to the terms, and sent an embassy led by Shin Dithapamauk, a learned monk, to the emperor's court.<ref name=yt-1-148-10/>

===Treaty of Beijing===
In January 1287, the embassy arrived at Beijing, and was received by the emperor. The Burmese delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country.<ref name=tt-136/> (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) Upper Burma would continue to be organized as Zhengmian (Cheng-Mien) while Lower Burma would be organized as Mianzhong ({{zh|t=<U+7DEC><U+4E2D>|w=Mien-Chung}}). In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops.<ref name=gc-194/> For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. The Burmese embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287, and reported the terms to the king.<ref name=yt-1-148-10/>

===Breakdown===
But the agreement broke down a month later. In late June, the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan. But on 1 July 1287, the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son [[Thihathu of Prome|Thihathu]], the [[List of rulers of Prome|Viceroy of Prome]].<ref name=yt-1-149-3>Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 149, footnote 3</ref> Anarchy ensued. Each region in the country which had not revolted broke away. No successor to Narathihapate, who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing, emerged. Indeed, a king would not emerge until May 1289.<ref name=tt-137>Than Tun 1964: 137</ref>

==Mongol intervention (1287)==
Given the chaos, the governor of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan.<ref name=gc-194/> According to mainstream traditional ([[British Burma|British colonial era]]) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome.<ref name=geh-69>Harvey 1925: 69</ref> But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest.<ref name=hy-94>Yule 1874: 95</ref> 

Recent research shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan.<ref name=ath-34-35>Aung-Thwin and Hall 2011: 34<U+2013>35</ref><ref name=vbl-121>Lieberman 2003: 121</ref> They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders [[Athinkhaya]], [[Yazathingyan]] and [[Thihathu]], and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan.<ref name=msf-88-90/><ref name=ath-34-35/> (An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army.<ref name=mha-72>Htin Aung 1967: 72</ref><ref name=tt-1959-121>Than Tun 1959: 121</ref>) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan, the damage they inflicted was probably minimal.<ref name=vbl-119>Lieberman 2003: 119</ref> At any rate, the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties, and retreated north to Tagaung. They remained there as the treaty was now void.<ref name=tt-137/>

==Aftermath==
The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete. But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created. They would send no more expeditions to restore order. The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to pacify the fragmented country. Indeed, his real aim all along may have been "to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented."<ref name=mha-83>Htin Aung 1967: 83</ref> It would be another two years until one of Narathihapate's sons, [[Kyawswa of Pagan|Kyawswa]], emerged as king of Pagan in May 1289. But the new "king" controlled just a small area around the capital, and had no real army. The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers.<ref name=mha-72/>

The uneasy arrangement would persist until 1297. The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to Tagaung as the province of Zhengmian (Cheng-Mien) but ended the fictional Lower Burma province of Mianzhong (Mien-Chung) on 18 August 1290.<ref name=gc-194/> Meanwhile, the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers blatantly consolidating support. To check their rising power, Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297, and was recognized by the Mongol emperor [[Tem<U+00FC>r Khan, Emperor Chengzong of Yuan|Tem<U+00FC>r Khan]] as King of Pagan on 20 March 1297. The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of Kyawswa. The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power. On 17 December 1297, the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa, and founded the [[Myinsaing Kingdom]].<ref name=tt-1959-119-120>Than Tun 1959: 119<U+2013>120</ref><ref name=mha-74>Htin Aung 1967: 74</ref> The dethronement forced the Mongol government to intervene again, leading to the [[second Mongol invasion of Burma]] (1300<U+2013>01). The invasion failed. Two years later, on 4 April 1303, the Mongols abolished the province of Zhengmian (Cheng-Mien), evacuated Tagaung, and returned to Yunnan.<ref name=tt-137/>

==Legacy==
[[File:Burma in 1450.png|thumb|Burma c. 1450 with Ava at its peak, nearer Shan states paid tribute to Ava]]
The war was one of several near simultaneous wars waged by the Mongol Empire in the late 13th century. Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols, the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma. The invasions ushered in a period of political fragmentation, and the rise of Tai-Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia.

===Age of political fragmentation===
The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire. However, the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it.<ref name=atat-105>Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 105</ref> Pagan's disintegration was "in fact more prolonged and agonized."<ref name=vbl-119/> The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century. Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government, the collapse could have been temporary, and the country <U+201C>could have risen again<U+201D>.<ref name=geh-74>Harvey 1925: 74</ref> But the dynasty could not recover, and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum, no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath.<ref name=atat-105/> As a result, several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century. It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the Irrawaddy basin, restoring some semblance of normalcy.<ref group=note>King [[Thadominbya]] of [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] reunified central Burma in 1364<U+2013>67. King [[Razadarit]] of [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Pegu]] unified Lower Burma's three Mon-speaking provinces in 1388<U+2013>89.</ref> The vast region surrounding the Irrawaddy valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai-Shan states well into the 16th century.<ref name=atat-115-116>Aung-Thwin and Aung-Thwin 2012: 115<U+2013>116</ref>

===Rise of Tai-Shan states===
Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Mongol invasions was the emergence of [[Tai peoples|Tai-Shan]] states in mainland Southeast Asia. The Tai-Shan people who came down with the Mongol invasions stayed. By the early 14th century, several Tai-Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present-day Assam to northern and eastern Myanmar to northern and central Thailand and Laos. Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols, who viewed the states as a useful buffer between Yunnan and the rest of Southeast Asia. The Mongols, who were still trying to incorporate Yunnan into the central administration, were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of Yunnan into the fold. (The integration of Yunnan itself into <U+201C>China Proper<U+201D> was to take several more centuries, and continues to today.<ref name=tmu-2011-171/>) As such, from the newly formed Tai-Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and Champa in eastern Southeast Asia, the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute.<ref name=geh-69/><ref name=maat-2011-34-35>Aung-Thwin 2011: 34<U+2013>35</ref> Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government, they were the native chieftains, <U+201C>who would have ruled there in any case, and they did as they pleased.<U+201D><ref name=geh-73>Harvey 1925: 73</ref>

===Arrival of China on the Burmese border===
The war also marked the arrival of China at the doorstep of Burma. The old Dali Kingdom, known to the Burmese as Gandalarit ({{my|<U+1002><U+1014><U+1039><U+1010><U+101C><U+101B><U+102C><U+1007><U+103A>}}, after [[Gandhara|Gandhara Raj]])<ref name=tmu-2011-167>Myint-U 2011: 167</ref> was now a Mongol Chinese province. (The Burmese now called the new powers at Yunnan "Taruk" after the Turkic-speaking soldiers of Yunnan. Over the years, the term Taruk came to be used to refer to the [[Han Chinese]]. Today, King Narathihapate is remembered as Taruk-Pye Min, ("the King who fled from the Taruk [Chinese]).<ref name=app-8-9>Phayre 1967: 8<U+2013>9</ref><ref name=hy-94>Yule 1874: 94</ref>) From a geopolitical standpoint, the Mongol<U+2013>Chinese presence in Yunnan pushed the Shan migrations in the direction of Burma (and parts of the Khmer Empire).<ref name=vbl-123>Lieberman 2003: 123</ref> The raids by various Shan states into Upper Burma would continue until the mid-16th century.<ref name=vbl-124-125>Lieberman 2003: 124<U+2013>125</ref>

==Mongolia<U+2013>Myanmar relations==
During the official visit by the President [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]] to Myanmar in November 2013, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the chairperson of [[National League for Democracy]], said this was the first ever Mongol mission since the Mongols came 730 years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics.news.mn/content/162714.shtml|title=<U+0410><U+043D> <U+0421><U+0430><U+043D> <U+0421><U+0443> <U+0427><U+0438>: <U+0422><U+0430> <U+0431><U+04AF><U+0445><U+044D><U+043D> <U+041C><U+044C><U+044F><U+043D><U+043C><U+0430><U+0440><U+0442> 730 <U+0436><U+0438><U+043B><U+0438><U+0439><U+043D> <U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0430> <U+0445><U+04E9><U+043B> <U+0442><U+0430><U+0432><U+044C><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D> <U+041C><U+043E><U+043D><U+0433><U+043E><U+043B><U+044B><U+043D> <U+0430><U+043D><U+0445><U+043D><U+044B> <U+0442><U+04E9><U+043B><U+04E9><U+04E9><U+043B><U+04E9><U+0433><U+0447><U+0438><U+0434>|date=May 20, 2013|website=politics.news.mn|language=mn}}</ref>
