'''103 SS Heavy Panzer Battalion''' or '''s.SS-Panzer Abteilung 103 '''(German) was originally formed on 1 July 1943 as the II.Battalion, 11 SS Panzer Regiment and sent to [[Yugoslavia]] to fight as infantry, however, at the end of November, the battalion was converted back to the Tanks.
The Battalion was then issued six [[Tiger I]] tanks in February for training, but then ordered to give them to another unit in March 1944. Another six Tiger Is arrived at the training grounds on 26 May and four more in August. On 20 October, all ten Tigers were given to the training unot and the 103 was outfitted with the [[Tiger II]] before being ordered to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], as part of the [[III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps]]. The 103 SS Pz Btn, (later renamed the 503rd) had a total of 39 (instead of the full complement of 45) Tiger IIs and was loaded on to trains on 27 January 1945, and sent to the Eastern Front in the Army Group [[Weichsel]] sector. By 15 April 1945, the 503rd reported a total of 12 Tiger IIs, of which 10 were still operational. <ref>{{cite web|title=tigers02|url=http://www.fprado.com/armorsite/tigers-02.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=tiger.tank.battalion|url=http://www.lonesentry.com/panzer/tiger-tank-abteilung.html}}</ref>
