The '''Battle of Fleurus''' was fought during the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] on [[1 July]], [[1690]]. The French army of the [[Spanish Netherlands]] was commanded by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Henri de Montmorency-Bouteville, duc de Luxembourg]]; the Allied army comprising Dutch, German, Spanish, and British troops was commanded by [[Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck]]. 

Luxembourg commanded 35,000 troops, comprising of 34 [[battalions]] and 94 [[squadrons]]; Prince Waldeck commanded 38,000 men. Despite suffering 6,000 casualties, the battle was an overwhelming victory for France <U+2013> the allies suffered almost 20,000 killed, wounded or taken prisoner. Although the French decided not to follow up their victory <U+2013> allowing the Allies to seek safety in [[Brussels]] <U+2013> they were able to impose war taxes on a broad area of now-undefended territory.<ref>Lynn: ''The French Wars 1667-1714: The Sun King at War'' p.51</ref>

==Background==
By [[1690]] the Spanish Netherlands had become the main theatre of the war. The two maritime powers, [[England]] (sheltered behind the English Channel and her increasingly powerful navy) and the [[Dutch Republic]], were relatively secure from [[France|French]] invasion, ensuring a protracted struggle fought along the French borders, (the pace and goals of the land war throughout 1690<U+2013>92 would be somewhat limited).<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.205</ref>

[[William III of England|King William III]] had recently secured the English throne following the '[[Glorious Revolution]]', and  was currently engaged against [[James II of England|King James]] and his [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] supporters in an attempt to retake control of [[Ireland]]. William had therefore entrusted command of his main Allied army on the Continent to to his Dutch general, Prince Waldeck. The French forces facing Waldeck were now commanded by the talented Marshal Luxembourg who, if necessary, could call upon support from [[Louis Fran<U+00E7>ois, duc de Boufflers|Marshal Boufflers]]<U+2019> army on the [[Moselle River|Moselle]]. Luxembourg would continue this command until his death in 1695.

==Prelude==
Prince Waldeck had hoped to delay the campaign to enable the [[Frederick I of Prussia|Elector of Brandenburg]] to move on the Moselle and tie down Boufflers, but Luxembourg<U+2019>s early manoeuvres had allowed Boufflers to move between the rivers [[Sambre River|Sambre]] and Meuse to support the French commander.  In mid-June Luxembourg split his forces, detaching several battalions under [[Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humi<U+00E8>res|Marshal Humi<U+00E8>res]] to observe the Spanish forces (now reinforced with [[Hanover (state)|Hanoverian]] troops), while the main French army left [[Deinze]] and marched south, crossing the River Sambre at Jeumont on [[23 June]].<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.206</ref> Meanwhile, detachments from Boufflers forces under the command of Rubantel had augmented Luxembourg<U+2019>s army which, by [[27 June]], had camped at [[Boussu]].

As Luxembourg manoeuvred south of [[Mons]] and [[Charleroi]], Waldeck moved his camp between Nivelles and Pieton on [[28 June]]. That same evening, Luxembourg personally led a detachment from [[Gerpinnes]] (together with bridging pontoons), to establish a crossing of the Sambre at Ham. A fortified position at Froidmont (garrisoned by about 100 men) was soon compelled to surrender after artillery was brought across the river; a simultaneous attack by French [[dragoons]] seized an enemy [[redoubt]] that had been abandoned at the approach of Luxembourg<U+2019>s army.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.206</ref> With the bridgehead secure, the rest of the French army (apart from the heavy baggage that had remained on the south bank at Ham) crossed the Sambre on [[30 June]].

Waldeck decamped and moved towards the French bridgehead. French and Dutch cavalry sent out to reconnoitre the area crossed swords in an inconclusive action near [[Fleurus]], but by evening the French cavalry had withdrawn to Velaine where it was joined by the rest of their army, only 3 km from the Allies. 

==Battle==
On the morning of [[1 July]], Luxembourg marched his forces towards Fleurus. Waldeck had set up his 38,000 troops in the two customary lines on the high ground between the village of Heppignies on their right and past the chateau of St Amant on their left; Waldeck<U+2019>s front was covered by the Orme stream whose elevated banks made a frontal assault all but impossible.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.207</ref>

His crushing victory at Fleurus was one of the great tactical successes of his career.<ref>Lynn: ''The French Wars 1667-1714: The Sun King at War'' p.51</ref>]]

Luxembourg divided his forces to attack both flanks of the Allied army <U+2013> an audacious plan that in order for it to succeed would require secrecy and deception. The columns of the first French line split to take position between Heppignies and Fleurus, with some troops moving up towards St Amant. The two columns of Luxembourg<U+2019>s right veered off to the north across the Orme, their passage covered by the hedges and wheat fields, and by a screen of French cavalry. Forty cannon were positioned near the chateau of St Amant, and another 30 guns positioned between the chateau and Fleurus.

Waldeck had failed to notice the envelopment of his army.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.207</ref> After the French right wing was in position (commanded by Luxembourg himself), the French artillery opened fire at about 10:00. Their left wing, commanded by Lieutenant-General Jean Christophe, comte de Gournay, opened their attack with a cavalry charge but was killed in the assault; his death disordered his cavalry who retired to Fleurus to regroup.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.208</ref> A cavalry charge on the right wing however, met with more success. French infantry on both flanks now pressed the attack against Waldeck<U+2019>s line and, enveloped by the enemy, the Allied lines broke. Some of the Allied troops (both infantry and cavalry) regrouped on high ground near Fleurus, but were eventually overwhelmed. Despite being pressed by French cavalry, Waldeck was able to create a new line with his remaining forces further back. However, this line also was finally broken by French infantry flushed with confidence from their initial success.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.208</ref>

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Fleurus was a complete success for French arms, but devoid of result.<ref>Guizot: ''A Popular History of France From The Earliest Times, Volume V''</ref> [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], Louis<U+2019> war minister, wanted to order Luxembourg to immediately besiege [[Namur (city)|Namur]] or Charleroi, but [[Louis XIV of France|Louis]], concerned about the [[Louis, Grand Dauphin|Dauphin<U+2019>s]] forces in Germany and the imminent arrival of Brandenburg<U+2019>s army, ordered Luxembourg to augment Boufflers forces and forgo a siege. However, Luxembourg was able to put much of the land east of Brussels under contribution.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.209</ref>

The remainder of Waldeck<U+2019>s troops streamed towards [[Nivelles]]. His army had suffered a casualty rate of 50% of his forces, including 6,000 killed in action. Waldeck eventually retired on Brussels where his injured troops were replaced with men from fortress garrisons.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.209</ref> Spanish troops under Gasta<U+00F1>aga joined the main Allied army, as did Tilly with troops from [[Li<U+00E8>ge]] and [[Brandenburg]]. On [[2 August]], the Elector of Brandenburg<U+2019>s forces combined with Waldeck whose army now totalled 55,000 men. With this force, the Allied army marched to [[Genappe]], proceeding on to Nivelles on [[7 August]].

The remainder of the campaign season in the Spanish Netherlands was relatively quiet. Boufflers temporarily combined his forces with Luxembourg, but in late August he returned to the area between the Sambre and Meuse rivers. After a series of minor skirmishes, both the Allies and the French returned to winter quarters in October; Luxembourg, careful to station his men on enemy territory, whilst the Allies quartered in and around [[Maastricht]]. The Hanoverians returned home whilst Brandenburg and Luneberg found quarters in fortresses of the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV 1667-1714,'' p.210</ref>
