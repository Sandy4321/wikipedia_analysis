'''''A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy''''' is a [[1982 in film|1982]] film written and directed by [[Woody Allen]].

The plot revolves around a weekend party bringing together six people, loosely based on [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Smiles of a Summer Night]]''. This movie is notable for being the first of thirteen movies that Allen would make starring [[Mia Farrow]]. Farrow's role was originally written for another famous Allen lead actress, [[Diane Keaton]], but she couldn't take the part because she was busy promoting her film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]'' and preparing to begin production on the film ''Shoot the Moon''. It also marks the first appearance of Woody Allen as an ensemble performer in his own film, as previously he had either been the lead character or did not appear in his films.
