'''St Michael's Church, Llanfihangel Ysgeifiog''', is a former [[parish church]] in [[Anglesey]], north Wales, which is now closed and in ruins. The structure dates from the 15th century and a chapel was added to the north side in the 17th century.  A replacement church ([[St Michael's Church, Gaerwen|St Michael's, Gaerwen]]) was built elsewhere in the parish in 1847, and the old church was closed, partly demolished and abandoned. Some restoration work has taken place in the 21st century and some occasional services have been held.

It is a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]], a national designation given to "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/docs/cadw/publications/What_Is_Listing_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> in particular because it is "an important survival, retaining unrestored original late medieval features."<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5499|title=Church of St Michael (old church)|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|year=2009|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref>

==History and location==
St Michael's Church is set in a churchyard in the countryside of [[Anglesey]], north Wales, about {{convert|1.4|km}} from the village of [[Gaerwen]]. A footpath leads to the church from the nearest road, {{convert|200|m}} away.<ref name=List/> The area takes its name, in part, from the church: the Welsh word {{lang|cy|[[llan (placename element)|''llan'']]}} originally meant "enclosure" and then "church", and "&#8209;fihangel" is a [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|modified form]] of [[St Michael|Michael]] ({{lang-cy|Mihangel}}), the saint to whom the church is dedicated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/themes/pages/religion.shtml|title=Religion and creed in place names|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

The present structure dates from the 15th century and was extended in 1638 when a local family added a chapel on the north side.  A decision was taken in the 1840s to build a new church on a different site within the parish; the centre of population for the area had shifted because of coal mining in [[Pentre Berw]] and the construction of the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5 road]] across Anglesey as part of [[Thomas Telford]]'s road from London to [[Holyhead]].  [[St Michael's, Gaerwen]], opened in 1847. The old church then closed.<ref name=List/> By 1865, when the Welsh politician and church historian [[Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|Sir Stephen Glynne]] visited, only the chancel and north chapel remained, and a new wall had been built at the west end of the chancel where it once joined the nave.<ref name=Glynne/> Some restoration work has taken place in the 21st century, assisted by funding from the [[Welsh Government]] and [[Cadw]] (the statutory body responsible for the built heritage of Wales), and services have occasionally been held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/ancient-gaerwen-church-site-restored-2743207|title=Ancient Gaerwen church site restored for public|last=Barker|first=Rhodri|date=13 October 2010|accessdate=17 June 2013|work=[[Daily Post (North Wales)|Daily Post]]}}</ref>

By 1535, the positions of [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of St Michael's and vicar of [[St Ffinan's Church, Llanffinan|St Ffinan's Church]] were combined and held by the [[Dean of Bangor]] to increase the dean's income.<ref>{{cite book|series=Studies in Anglesey History|title=Medieval Anglesey|page=276|last=Carr|first=Antony|publisher=Anglesey Antiquarian Society|year=1982}}</ref> Other people associated with the church include [[Nicholas Owen (clergyman)|Nicholas Owen]] (appointed [[perpetual curate]] in 1790),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21024|title= Owen, Nicholas (1752<U+2013>1811)|last=Pollard|first=Albert|authorlink=Albert Pollard|coauthors=Walters, Huw|year=2004|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=17 June 2013}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> the priest and antiquarian John Jones (better known as "[[Llef o'r Nant]]"; curate 1809<U+2013>15),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-JONE-JHN-1786.html|title=Jones, John (1786?&ndash;1863), cleric and antiquary|last=Jenkins|first=Robert Thomas|year=2007|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> and [[Evan Lewis (priest)|Evan Lewis]] (curate 1845<U+2013>46, and later Dean of Bangor).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34513|title=Lewis, Evan (1818<U+2013>1901)|last=Thomas|first=D.

==Architecture and fittings==
All that remains of the church is the [[chancel]], which is 18&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches by 14&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches (5.6 by 4.4&nbsp;m), and the north chapel which is 15&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;inches by 13&nbsp;feet (4.7 by 4.0&nbsp;m); the [[nave]], south chapel and the roof have been demolished or removed.<ref name=RC/> The walls are built from [[rubble masonry]] dressed with sandstone.  The church is now entered through a doorway at the west end of the chancel; the doorway reuses a 15th-century pointed arch. The south wall still shows where there was formerly a chapel on that side.  On the opposite wall, there is a window from the late 16th century with three lights (sections of window separated by stonework); the entrance to the north chapel has been reduced in width. The three-light east window also dates from the late 16th century. An inscribed stone above the window records the date 1598.<ref name=List/> 

The north chapel has windows in the north and east wall in similar style to those in the chancel. There is an inscription above the north window recording the construction of the chapel in 1638. The west wall of the chapel has a blocked round-headed window, and there is a blocked-up pointed-arch doorway in the north wall.<ref name=List/>

The clergyman and antiquarian [[Harry Longueville Jones]] visited St Michael's in 1845. At that time, the church was {{convert|68|by|16|ft}} internally; he recorded the north chapel as measuring 12&nbsp;feet 8&nbsp;inches by 17&nbsp;feet (3.9 by 5.2&nbsp;m) and the south chapel, which was separated from the main body of the church by five rotting wooden columns, as {{convert|40|by|15|ft}}. The main entrance was through a porch on the south side of the nave, and there was another door on the north side. A bench under the windows on the north side of the nave was inscribed "T. M. 1684". The southern chapel, he said, had similar windows to those in the north chapel. On the external wall above the east window, he noted a shield topped by a coronet, apparently that of a viscount, and the date 1638. On a step by the altar he noted two gravestones that appeared to be those of priests, given that they had each been inscribed with a cross, and a third gravestone, similarly marked, was in use as the [[lintel]] above one of the doorways.<ref name=Jones/> A survey in 1937 by the [[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]] dated one of the gravestones by the altar to the 11th or 12th century.<ref name=RC/>

The churchyard contains some chest tombs from the 18th and 19th centuries, made of slate.<ref name=List/> The Royal Commission's survey also noted a fragment of a gravestone from between the 9th and 11th centuries that had been built into the [[bellcote]], and two 18th-century memorials within the church. The bell, church plate, and two benches bearing the inscription "T. M. 1684" were moved to the new church.<ref name=RC>{{cite book|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Anglesey|origyear=1937|year=1968|author=[[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]]|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|pages=83<U+2013>84|chapter=Llanfihangel-Escgeifiog}}</ref>

==Assessment==
[[File:Box graves at St Michael's Llanfihangel Ysgeifiog.jpg|thumb|left|Graves outside the east window]]
The church has national recognition and statutory protection from unauthorised alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 30 January 1968, and has been listed because it consists of the "the substantial remains of a 15th-century church with 17th-century additions." Cadw, which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists, also notes that because many old churches on Anglesey were rebuilt in the 19th century but this one was not, "these remains constitute an important survival, retaining unrestored original late medieval features."<ref name=List/>

Writing in 1833, before the church was closed, the antiquarian [[Angharad Llwyd]] described St Michael's as "a spacious and ancient structure."<ref name=Llwyd>{{cite book|last=Llwyd|first=Angharad|authorlink=Angharad Llwyd |page=266|title=A History of the Island of Mona|year=1833|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DMY_AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=R. Jones}}</ref> She also noted the "ancient stained glass" in the east window, "of brilliant colours".<ref name=Llwyd/> Visiting twelve years later, Harry Longueville Jones said that St Michael's was "greatly dilapidated" but had been "one of the most interesting in the island".<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal|first=Harry|last=Longueville Jones|authorlink=Harry Longueville Jones|date=July 1846|journal=[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]|volume=III|publisher=[[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]|pages=298<U+2013>300|title=Mona Mediaeva No. III|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam03powegoog#page/n371/mode/2up}}</ref> He described the north doorway of the nave as having "singularly elegant though mutilated details" and the bellcote as being "of good design".<ref name=Jones/> The state of the church, he wrote, was such that it was "almost unfit for the purposes of public worship."<ref name=Jones/>

Sir Stephen Glynne noted on his visit in 1865 that the church was now abandoned and presenting "a wretched scene of decay" internally.<ref name=Glynne/> He commented upon the "good mouldings and spandrels" of the doorway at the west end of the chancel, and also referred to the "debased character" of the north chapel.<ref name=Glynne>{{cite journal|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam08assogoog#page/n110/mode/2up|title=Notes on the Older Churches of the Four Welsh Dioceses|pages=99<U+2013>100|first=Sir Stephen|last=Glynne|authorlink=Sir Stephen Glynne, 9th Baronet|journal=Archaeologia Cambrensis|year=1900|publisher=Cambrian Archaeological Association|volume=XVII|series=5th}}</ref>

A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes it as being in "a lonely spot" and says that it is "well worth a visit."<ref name=Anglesey>{{cite book|title=Anglesey Churches|page=96|isbn=1845270894|publisher=[[Gwasg Carreg Gwalch]]|last=Jones|first=Geraint I. L.|year=2006}}</ref>
