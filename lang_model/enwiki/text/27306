'''Steve Moore''' (born [[11 June]] 1949) is a prolific British [[comics]] writer. He is credited with showing [[Alan Moore]] (no relation), then a struggling [[cartoonist]], how to write comic scripts, and the pair collaborated under pseudonyms on strips for ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine, including one which introduced the character [[Axel Pressbutton]]. Steve Moore's pseudonym was "Pedro Henry", Alan's was "[[Kurt Weill|Curt Vile]]".

He devised the ''[[Future Shocks]]'' format in ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'', and wrote the adventures of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], as well as co-creating the character [[Abslom Daak]] (with artist [[Steve Dillon]]) in [[Doctor Who Magazine]]. He also wrote several stories in ''[[Warrior (comic)|Warrior]]'' magazine, including, as Pedro Henry, a revival of Axel Pressbutton.

He currently writes "Young Tom Strong" and "Jonni Future" in ''[[Tom Strong's Terrific Tales]]'', an anthology from Alan Moore's [[America's Best Comics]] line. He also writes about [[Anomalous phenomenon|anomalous phenomena]] for the ''[[Fortean Times]]''.

Recent work for ''2000AD'' includes "Red Fang" (with artist [[Steve Yeowell]]), "Valkyries" (with American artist [[John Lucas (comics)|John Lucas]]) and a series of one-off short fantasy stories collected under the name ''[[Tales of Telguuth]]'' (with multiple artists).

Alan Moore recently wrote a long biographical essay about Steve Moore called "Unearthing" included in the anthology "London: City of Disappearances" edited by [[Iain Sinclair]] and published October 2006 by Hamish Hamilton (ISBN 0-241-14299-7).
