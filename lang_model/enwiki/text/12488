'''Salvatore "Sal" Mineo, Jr.''' ([[January 10]], [[1939]] <U+2013> [[February 12]], [[1976]]) was an [[United States|American]] movie and stage [[actor]], best known for his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated performance opposite [[James Dean]] in the film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]''.

Mineo, born in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]] as the son of a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] coffin maker, was enrolled by his mother in dancing and acting school at an early age. 

==Acting career==
Mineo had his first stage appearance in ''[[The Rose Tattoo]]'' (1950), a play by [[Tennessee Williams]]. He also played the young prince opposite [[Yul Brynner]] in the stage [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[The King and I]]''.

After a few more film and television appearances his breakthrough was ''[[Rebel Without A Cause]]'' ([[1955 in film|1955]]) in which he gave an impressive performance as John "Plato" Crawford, the sensitive teenager smitten with James Dean's Jim Stark. His biographer Paul Jeffers recounted that Mineo received thousands of fan letters from young female admirers, was mobbed by them at public appearances and further wrote, "He dated the most beautiful women in [[Hollywood]] and [[New York]]." On the other hand, in ''An Introduction to Film Studies'' (2003), Jill Nelmes discusses "how gay men derived particular sub-cultural messages from such films as ''Rebel Without a Cause'' when empathising with the relationship between Jim (James Dean) and Plato (Sal Mineo)." According to Robert Aldrich and Garry Wotherspoon's ''Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History: From World War II to the Present Day'', Dean's "loving tenderness towards the besotted Sal Mineo in ''Rebel Without a Cause''" touches and excites "gay audiences by its honesty." Mineo also appeared in Dean's last film, ''[[Giant (film)|Giant]]'' ([[1956 in film|1956]]), although they didn't share any screen time.

Many of his subsequent roles were variations of his role in ''Rebel Without a Cause'' and he often played juvenile delinquents. In the [[Disney]] adventure ''Tonka'', for instance, Mineo starred as a young [[Sioux]] named White Bull who traps and domesticates a clear-eyed, spirited wild horse named "Tonka" who becomes the famous horse [[Comanche (horse)|Comanche]]. In his book, ''Multiculturalism And The Mouse: Race and Sex in Disney Entertainment'' (2006), Douglas Brode states that the very casting of Mineo as White Bull again "ensured a homosexual subtext." By the late 1950s the actor was a major celebrity, sometimes referred to as the "Switchblade Kid."

In [[1957 in music|1957]], Mineo made a brief foray into music by recording a handful of songs and an album. Two of his singles reached the Top 40 pop charts. He starred as drummer [[Gene Krupa]] in the movie [[The Gene Krupa Story]] ([[1959 in film|1959]]), co-starring [[Susan Kohner]], [[James Darren]], and [[Susan Oliver]], and directed by [[Don Weis]].

Meanwhile, Mineo made an effort to break his [[typecasting]]. His acting ability and exotic good looks earned him not only roles as a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] boy in ''Tonka'', but also as a [[Jew]]ish emigrant in [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Exodus (movie)|Exodus]]'' ([[1960 in film|1960]]) for which he received another Academy Award nomination as [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (and reportedly was bitterly disappointed when he didn't win.)

By the early 1960s he was getting too old to play the types that had made him famous and for a variety of reasons wasn't considered appropriate for leading roles. He auditioned for [[David Lean]]'s film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' but wasn't hired. Mineo was baffled by his sudden loss of popularity, later saying "One minute it seemed I had more movie offers than I could handle, the next, no one wanted me."

His role as a [[stalking|stalker]] in ''Who Killed Teddy Bear?'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]), co-starring [[Juliet Prowse]], didn't seem to help. Although his performance was praised by critics, he found himself typecast anew, now as a deranged criminal. (He never entirely escaped this; one of his last roles was a guest spot on the 1975 TV series [[S.W.A.T. (TV series)|S.W.A.T.]] playing a Manson-like cult leader.) He returned to the stage to produce the [[gay]]-themed ''[[Fortune and Men's Eyes]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]), starring [[Don Johnson]] of later ''[[Miami Vice]]'' fame. Although the play got positive reviews in Los Angeles, it was panned during a run in New York and its expanded prison [[rape]] scene was criticized as excessive and prurient. A string of failed projects and flops followed. A small role in ''[[Escape from the Planet of the Apes]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]) as [[chimpanzee]] [[Dr. Milo (Planet of the Apes)|Dr. Milo]] turned out to be Mineo's last movie appearance.

==Murder==
By 1976 Mineo's career seemed to be turning around again. Playing the role of a gay [[burglary|burglar]] in a [[San Francisco]] run of the stage comedy ''[[P.S. Your Cat Is Dead]]'', he received substantial [[publicity]] from many positive reviews and moved on to [[Los Angeles]] with the play. Arriving home after a rehearsal on [[February 12]], [[1976]], Mineo was stabbed to death in the alley behind a [[West Hollywood]] apartment building. He was 37 years old. (He was stabbed just once, not repeatedly as first reported, but the blade struck his heart, leading to immediate and massive internal bleeding.) 

According to Warren Johansson and William A. Percy's ''Outing: Shattering the [[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|Conspiracy of Silence]]'', he was murdered under circumstances that suggested "a homosexual motive." Investigators reportedly found gay pornography in his home and assumed that such men would only have their sexuality as a defining mark in every aspect of their life. (Mineo identified himself as "bisexual" in a 1972 interview, published after his death, but his biography notes that he dated men exclusively in the last years of his short life.)  

[[Image:1 Sal Mineo cr.jpg|thumb|300px|The footstone of Sal Mineo in [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery]]]] A career criminal named [[Lionel Ray Williams]] was later sentenced to [[life in prison]] for killing Mineo. Although there was considerable confusion relating to what witnesses had seen in the darkness the night Mineo was murdered, Williams was reported to have boasted of the crime, which turned out to be a botched mugging. At the time of the murder, Williams had no idea who Sal Mineo was. Williams was [[parole]]d in 1990, after serving twelve years, but was jailed numerous times afterwards for parole violations.

Mineo is interred in the [[Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven]] in [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], [[New York]].

==At the opera==
A little-known facet of Mineo's career was his involvement with opera.  On [[May 8]] [[1954]], he portrayed the Page (miming to the voice of mezzo-soprano Carol Jones) in the NBC Opera Theatre's production of [[Richard Strauss]]' ''Salome'' (in English translation), set to the play of [[Oscar Wilde]].  Elaine Malbin performed the title role, and [[Peter Herman Adler]] conducted [[Kirk Browning]]'s production.

In December of 1972, Mineo stage directed [[Gian Carlo Menotti]]'s ''The Medium'', in Detroit.  [[Muriel Costa-Greenspon]] portrayed the medium, Madame Flora, and Mineo himself played the mute Toby.

==Quote==
"No one ever said movies are for developing your range. Hardly anyone gets that opportunity. Which is why I think the stage is so good. It's less bread, but you can play different types, and you can initiate your own projects."
