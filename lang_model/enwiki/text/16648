'''Gichin Funakoshi''' (<U+8239><U+8D8A> <U+7FA9><U+73CD> ''Funakoshi Gichin'', [[1868]]<U+2013>[[April 26]] [[1957]]) was one of the [[Okinawa]]n [[karate]] masters who introduced karate to the [[Japanese Archipelago|Japanese mainland]] in [[1921]].  He was the founder of the [[Sh<U+014D>t<U+014D>kan-ry<U+016B>|Sh<U+014D>t<U+014D>kan]] style of  karate.  

Funakoshi had trained in both of the popular styles of Okinawan karate of the time: [[Sh<U+014D>rei-ry<U+016B>]] and [[Sh<U+014D>rin-ry<U+016B>]].  His own styl was influenced by [[kendo]] distancing and timings. Shotokan is named after Gichin Funakoshi's pen name, "Shoto," which means "pine waves" or "wind in the pines". "Sh<U+014D>t<U+014D>kan" means "Shoto's house" or "Shoto's school." 

In 1936 Funakoshi built the first Shotokan [[dojo]] in [[Tokyo]]. He changed the name of karate to mean "empty hand" instead of the [[Okinawan]] "[[China]] hand," which sound the same but are written differently. His doing this upset some Okinawans, and afterwards, he never returned.

This eventually led to the creation of the [[Japan Karate Association]] (JKA) in 1955 with Funakoshi named as the chief instructor. However, Funakoshi was not supportive of all of the changes that the organization made to his karate. He remained in Tokyo until his death on [[April 26]] [[1957]], aged 88. After [[World War II]], Funakoshi's surviving students (largely consisting of university students) formalized his teachings. 

Funakoshi published several books on karate, including his autobiography<U+2014>"Karate-Do: My Way of Life."
