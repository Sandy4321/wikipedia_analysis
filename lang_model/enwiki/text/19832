'''ORP ''Grom''''' (Thunder) was one of two [[Grom class destroyer|''Grom''-class]] [[destroyer]]s serving in the [[Polish Navy]] during [[World War II]]. The [[lead ship]] of her class, she was laid down in [[1935]], commissioned in [[1937]] and lost in battle on [[May 4]], 1940 in [[Ofotfjord]] near [[Narvik]] during the [[Norwegian campaign]].

Ordered in the British [[Cowes]]-based [[J. Samuel White]] shipyard, ORP ''Grom'' was thought of as a large destroyer, similar to flotilla leaders. She and her younger sister ship [[ORP B<U+0142>yskawica]] were to support the outdated French-built [[ORP Wicher]] and [[ORP Burza]] in the role of the core of the Polish Navy in a possible conflict. As Poland had only one major seaport, the main task of the Polish naval forces was to secure supplies shipment to and from the allied countries. Because of that, the ''Grom'' class was designed to fulfill both the role of shore defence and [[convoy escort]] and was supposed to be stronger, than single enemy destroyers. Two Parsons' [[steam turbine]]s of 54,000&nbsp;shp altogether, 3 [[boiler]]s and 2 shafts allowed the ''Grom'' to travel at 39&nbsp;knots, faster than the contemporary designs like [[Farragut class destroyer (1934)|''Farragut'']], [[Porter class destroyer|''Porter'']], [[Tribal class destroyer (1936)|''Tribal'']] or [[Leberecht Maass (Z-1)|''Leberecht Maass'' class]]. Also, as it was not clear whether the ships would be used to secure convoys to the Polish port of [[Gdynia]] or the Romanian port of [[Constan<U+0163>a]], the possible range was much larger than in the case of destroyers designed exclusively for the [[Baltic Sea]]. At 15&nbsp;knots, the ship had an effective range of 3500&nbsp;[[nautical mile|NM]].

On [[August 30]], [[1939]], the Polish destroyers [[ORP Burza]], [[ORP B<U+0142>yskawica]] and ORP ''Grom'' were ordered to activate the [[Peking Plan]], and the warships headed for Great Britain, from where they were to operate as convoy escorts. On [[September 1]], 1939, Polish destroyers met the British destroyers [[HMS Wanderer]] and [[HMS Wallace]]. The British ships led the Polish flotilla to [[Leith]], and in the night the Polish destroyers came to [[Rosyth]]. However, no convoys were ever organized to help Poland during the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Polish Defensive War]] and the Polish ships were used in support of allied maritime operations. 

During her operations on the Narvik front the ''Grom'' was ranked by the German soldiers as probably the most hated of all the allied ships deployed to the area. This hatred was founded by the fact that the ''Grom'' took an intense interest in all hostile movements on shore and was reputed to spend hours lurking the coast in order to kill even a single German. ''Grom'' was carrying out the last of her many [[Naval Gunfire Support|NGFS]] missions in the Narvik area when she was sunk by [[Luftwaffe]] [[bombers]] in the Rombaken [[fjord]]. On [[May 4]], [[1940]] the loaded midship torpedo launcher was struck by a bomb from a German plane and the torpedo exploded, causing the hull to break into two parts and the ship to sink almost immediately. 59 sailors lost their lives. 

The wreck was never raised and it was not until [[October 6]], [[1986]], that it was penetrated for the first time.
