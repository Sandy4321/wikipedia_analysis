==History==
{{RC Mariology}}
The first Roman Catholic cathedral of Hong Kong was built in 1843 on Wellington Street and destroyed in a fire in 1859. The cathedral was rebuilt, but subsequently a different site was selected just above Caine Road by the Glenealy Ravine, where it is still located today. The Cathedral was designed by Crawley and Company of London. Construction of the new building started in 1883.  Services first began in July 1886 under the auspices of the   Apostolic Vicar [[Dominic Pozzoni]] and the first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] was celebrated on 7 December 1888. 

It was a [[Cathedral]] from the time it was built, as the seat of the [[apostolic vicariate]] that preceded the establishment of the [[diocese]] in 1946;  however, it was not consecrated as a cathedral until 1938. 

===Renovation===
The Cathedral<U+2019>s original timber roof was replaced with a concrete roof in 1952; the main altar was also reconstructed in the early 1980s.  

The Cathedral underwent renovation in 2002, and the renovation project was recognized by an Honorable Mention in the 2003 [[UNESCO]] Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation.
