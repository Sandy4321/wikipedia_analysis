'''''Nimrod''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by the American [[punk rock]] band [[Green Day]], released on October 14, 1997 through [[Reprise Records]].  The group began work on the album in the wake of their cancellation of a European tour after the release of ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]''. Recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, the album was written with the intent of creating solid songs as opposed to a cohesive album. As a result, ''Nimrod'' is noted for its musical diversity and experimentation, and contains elements of [[Folk music|folk]], [[surf rock]], and [[ska]]. The lyrical themes discussed on the record include maturity, personal reflection, and fatherhood.

The album peaked at number ten on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' U.S. charts and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The record also was certified triple platinum in Australia and double platinum in Canada. ''Nimrod'' also received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Armstrong's songwriting on the record. The album yielded the acoustic hit "[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]", which appeared at numerous pop culture events, including [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|the series finale]] of the sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' in 1998. To promote the album, Green Day embarked on an extensive touring schedule.

==Background==
In 1995, Green Day released ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'', which did not perform as well critically and commercially as the band's breakthrough major label debut ''[[Dookie]]'' (1994).<ref name="Spitz123">Spitz, 2006, p. 123</ref> Speaking of ''Insomniac'', vocalist/guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] noted, "It did a lot better than I thought it was going to do...From the sound of it, we knew it wasn't going to sell as much as ''Dookie''."<ref name="Beyondpunk">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CQoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=green+day+good+riddance+acoustic&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7SP7T7LHOsOA2wX9zIzlBg&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=green%20day%20good%20riddance%20acoustic&f=false|title=Green Day Grows Beyond Punk On 'Nimrod'|last=Rosen|first=Craig|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=September 20, 1997|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}</ref> The group embarked on an extensive world tour to promote ''Insomniac'' in early 1996, which saw the band performing in sports arenas that contrasted with the small clubs the group was accustomed to playing.  The members became increasingly uncomfortable with the level of stardom they had attained; Armstrong recalled, "We were becoming the things we hated, playing those big arenas.  It was beginning to be not fun anymore."<ref name="Spitz123"/>

Green Day also became [[homesick]] as touring forced the members to leave behind their families. The band eventually decided to cancel the late 1996 European leg of the ''Insomniac'' tour to take time off to spend at home.<ref name="Spitz126">Spitz, 2006, p. 126</ref>  During this time, the band continued to write, and eventually completed over three dozen new songs by the beginning of 1997.<ref name="Spitz127">Spitz, 2006, p. 127</ref>  Although the group's last effort with producer [[Rob Cavallo]] was considered a disappointment, the band did not contemplate choosing anyone else to work with on ''Nimrod'', as the members viewed Cavallo as a "mentor".<ref name="Spitz127"/>

Why hide it? | source =<U+2013> Billie Joe Armstrong, on the album's musical diversity.<ref name="Branches"/>}}
The album was recorded at Conway Studios in [[Los Angeles]], and the band stayed at the [[Sunset Marquis Hotel]] during the sessions.<ref name="Spitz128">Spitz, 2006, p. 128</ref>  ''Nimrod'' took four months to record<ref name="Spitz128"/> and, Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending "a little to much time" playing [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] and [[foosball]] during the sessions.<ref name="Beyondpunk"/>  The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to two in the morning every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily.<ref name="Spitz128"/>  Bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] recalled, "One night one of us was walking down the halls knocking on people's doors while naked."<ref name="Spitz128"/>  Another incident involved drummer [[Tre Cool]] throwing his hotel room television set out of his window.  Armstrong noted, "There was a lot of glass.  You have to live that arrogant lifestyle every now and then."<ref name="Spitz129">Spitz, 2006, p. 129</ref>  To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father and manager Pat Magnarella to supervise the group.<ref name="Spitz129"/>

While working on ''Nimrod'', Green Day explained to Cavallo their desire to create a more experimental album as the band had grown tired of its traditional three chord song structure.  Armstrong drew inspiration from [[The Clash]]'s landmark record ''[[London Calling]]'', and referred to ''Nimrod'' as "the record I've wanted to make since the band started."<ref name="Spitz128"/>  The album, which is nearly twice as long as ''Dookie'', was intended to break the constraints of typical punk rock music.<ref name="Spitz128"/>  To preserve the quality of his songwriting, Armstrong began writing each song on acoustic guitar, to which the rest of the band would later add heavier instrumentation and faster tempos.<ref name="Progressing">{{cite news|title=Green Day keeps progressing with 'Nimrod'|last=McLennan|first=Scott|work=Telegram & Gazette|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 9, 1997}}</ref>  Green Day recorded around 30 songs for ''Nimrod'' and picked 18 of them for the record. Dirnt explained that the recording was much more loosely structured than previous albums, and that creating songs was the focus as opposed to making a cohesive record.<ref name="Progressing"/>  He observed, "We've always screwed around with different types of music during our jams, but we'd say, 'OK let's stop and get back to the album.' This time we just let them come up."<ref name="Progressing"/>

[[File:Green Day Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Armstrong (pictured in 2010) wrote "[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]" seven years before the band began recording ''Nimrod''.|alt=A man with black hair wearing a black button-up shirt and red pinstriped pants is singing into a microphone and playing a blue and white guitar.  Behind him in the bottom-right corner, a blonde man in a black shirt is also performing.]]

Reprise Records president [[Howie Klein]] spent a lot of time in the studio with the band during recording, and recalled that, "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same.  There was so much growth in the band."<ref name="Beyondpunk"/>  The musical maturation displayed on ''Nimrod'' was partially inspired by [[Bikini Kill]]'s ''[[Reject All American]]'' (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance "rough punk rock songs" and "delicate pretty songs".<ref name="Beyondpunk"/>  Armstrong wrote "[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)]]" in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the ''Dookie'' recording sessions in 1993.<ref name="Spitz131">Spitz, 2006, p. 131</ref>  During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on ''Dookie'', and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording.<ref name="Spitz131"/>  When the time came to record ''Nimrod'', Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track.  He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most."<ref name="Spitz131"/>  Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings "I knew we had done the right thing.  I knew it was a hit the second I heard it."<ref name="Spitz131"/>

In addition to the strings on "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)", the music of ''Nimrod'' contains a variety of other instruments not featured on previous Green Day albums. "Walking Alone" features Armstrong playing the [[harmonica]], despite the fact that he did not "know how to play it at all".<ref name="Branches">{{cite news|title=PUNK BONDS: Green Day branches out with 'Nimrod'|last=Brown|first=Greg|date=November 28, 1997|work=The Denver Post|publisher=MediaNews Group}}</ref> "Hitchin' a Ride" opens with a [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]]-inspired violin performed by [[Petra Haden]] of [[That Dog]].<ref name="Spitz130">Spitz, 2006, p. 130</ref>  The band invited [[Gabrial McNair]] and [[Stephen Bradley (musician)|Stephen Bradley]] of [[No Doubt]]'s horn section to play on the ska-influenced "King for a Day".<ref name="Punkviolin">{{cite news|title=Punk and violins Green Day remains a garage band|last=Rosen|first=Craig|work=Milwaukee Sentinel Journal|date=September 18, 1997}}</ref><ref name="Dawns">{{cite news|title=With Nimrod, Green Day Dawns Again|last=Parks|first=Andrew|work=[[The Buffalo News]]|publisher=Berkshire Hathaway|date=November 25, 1997}}</ref>

''Nimrod'' is more musically varied than previous Green Day albums.  Armstrong noted that with the album, Green Day went down "different avenues," adding: "Each song has its own character and identity so we wanted to be able to bring that out as much as possible."<ref name="Stretch">{{cite news|title=Green Day stretches out on 'Nimrod'|last=Sullivan|first=Jim|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=October 10, 1997|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}</ref> Sandy Masuo of the ''Los Angeles Times'' likened "Worry Rock" to the music of [[Elvis Costello]].<ref name="LATimesreview"/> "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" has been referred to as a "pop-punk campfire singalong ballad".<ref name="Diehl70"/> After opening with Haden's violin solo, "Hitchin' a Ride" evolves into a bass-driven rock song with a "[[Stray Cats]] vibe".<ref name="Progressing"/><ref name="Spitz130"/> Cool referred to "Take Back" (on which Armstrong employs [[death metal]]-style vocals during the chorus) and "Platypus (I Hate You)" as "some of the most punk songs we've ever done".<ref name="Lures">{{cite news|title=Branching out lures in Green Day `Nimrod' a collection of 'whatever comes out'|last=McGarrigle|first=Dale|work=Bangor Daily News|publisher=Bangor Publishing Company|date=May 11, 1998|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="TheType"/>  "Last Ride In" is a [[surf rock]] instrumental, and "King for a Day" is a [[ska punk]] song featuring a horn section.<ref name="TheType"/>  Armstrong compared the song to the [[Oi!]] genre, and noted "It would be funny for a bunch of macho fraternity guys to be singing along and, little do they know, the song's about being in drag."<ref name="Beyondpunk"/>  The "chiming" guitar riffs of "Redundant" have been compared to those of [[The Byrds]].<ref name="RSReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/nimrod-19971020  |title=Review: Green Day - Nimrod|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann Wenner|date=October 20, 1997|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}</ref>

Lyrically, ''Nimrod'' touches upon more reflective themes not present on earlier Green Day albums.  Much of the album illustrates Armstrong's sentiments on growing up and his role as a husband and father.<ref name="Beyondpunk"/> "The Grouch" centers on Armstrong's fears of "wasting away, getting fat, becoming impotent, and losing his ideals."<ref name="Stretch"/>  On "Walking Alone", he reflects on old friends from his childhood, and notes that he is "too drunk to figure out they're fading away."<ref name="Stretch"/>  Armstrong discusses the struggle to stay sober on "Hitchin' a Ride".<ref name="Beyondpunk"/>  "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" was inspired by Armstrong's failed relationship with a woman that ended when she joined the [[Peace Corps]] in 1990.<ref name="Spitz70">Spitz, 2006, p. 70</ref>  The same woman is also the subject of "[[She (Green Day song)|She]]" from ''Dookie'' and "She's a Rebel" from ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004).<ref name="Spitz70"/><ref name="Spitz94">Spitz, 2006, p. 94</ref>

However, other songs contain subject matter and themes more typical of Green Day's previous work. Armstrong wrote "Nice Guys Finish Last" about the band's interactions with the band's lawyers and managers and how "everybody thinks they know what's best for you."<ref name="billiethekid">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZsS_O9LQNKAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=green+day+nimrod+spin&source=bl&ots=HW4lBFUAfF&sig=CznHCRhAaxiTjtBwoD-zuFXN5Js&hl=en&sa=X&ei=M7AFUJiYEKfA2gXX9J2cBQ&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Ballad of Billie the Kid|last=Gold|first=Jonathan|work=Spin|publisher=Bob Guccione, Jr.|date=December 1997|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}</ref> "Jinx" contains self-deprecating lyrics characteristic of many of the band's songs, while "Prosthetic Head" has been referred to as a "typical ticked-off kiss-off".<ref name="Stretch"/><ref name="AVClubreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/green-day-nimrod,20832/|title=Green Day: Nimrod - Review|last=Thompson|first=Stephen|work=The A.V.

The album received generally positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic]] gave ''Nimrod'' three and a half stars out of five, calling it an "invigorating, if occasionally frustrating listen", and although he praised Armstrong's "gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies", he noted that "the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed."<ref name="Allmusic"/>  Greg Kot of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' enjoyed the album's melodic nature as well as the "measure of sincerity" present in Armstrong's vocals.<ref name="RSReview"/>  Kot appreciated the return of the band's "juvenile sense of humor" that he felt was lacking on ''Insomniac'', and praised the musical diversity on the record, remarking, "This music is a long way from Green Day's apprenticeship at the Gilman Street punk clubs, in Berkeley, Calif. But now that the band has seen the world, it's only fitting that Green Day should finally make an album that sounds as if it has."<ref name="RSReview"/>

A group of editors writing for ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' also praised the record's "fresh and original" melodies and "quick-tempoed cool", adding, "Kudos to Green Day, young punk's reigning purists, for sticking with what they know best."<ref name="Peoplerev">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20123599,00.html|title=Picks and Pans Review: Nimrod|last=Carlin|first=Peter|work=People|publisher=Time, Inc.|date=November 3, 1997|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}</ref>  Sandy Masuo of the ''Los Angeles Times'' enjoyed the "mature songwriting that really makes this album tick", noting that "Naturally, a couple of thrash 'n' bash hard-core paeans are included, but they're surrounded by songs that are surprisingly varied in character and grounded in a pop aesthetic that evokes a gaggle of great tunesmiths."<ref name="LATimesreview">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/12/entertainment/ca-41846|title=Cool Tunes, for a Bunch of Punks : GREEN DAY "Nimrod" Reprise|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tribune Company|last=Masuo|first=Sandy|date=October 12, 1997|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}</ref>  Stephen Thompson of ''[[The A.V.

==Promotion==
[[File:Tower Records Manhattan.jpg|thumb|The band's first promotional appearance for the release of ''Nimrod'' took place at the [[Tower Records]] store in Manhattan.  The performance escalated into a riot.|alt=A street view of a store front prominently features a yellow taxi in front of the store. The walls contain clear windows with the phrase "Tower Records - Video" in bright orange lights.]]
The ''Nimrod'' promotional tour began in the fall of 1997, and began with an in-store record signing at a [[Tower Records]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref name="Spitz133">Spitz, 2006, p. 133</ref>  The band was upset upon reading reviews that suggested the band had lost its punk edge, and started a riot during its scheduled eight-song set at the store.<ref name="Spitz134">Spitz, 2006, p. 134</ref> Armstrong then wrote the words "fuck" and "nimrod" in black spray paint on the storefront windows, and proceeded to [[Mooning|moon]] the audience of 1,400 people.<ref name="Spitz134"/>  After the riot settled down, Cool threw his bass drum into the crowd.  No charges were filed and no injuries were reported, but the store was closed for the day to repair damages caused.<ref name="Spitz134"/>

On the tour in promotion of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists to play for the new songs.  Armstrong commented, "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A lot of people want to hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us."<ref name="Branches"/>  The ''Nimrod'' tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments.<ref name="Spitz136">Spitz, 2006. p. 136</ref>  During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved <U+2014> where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band."<ref name="Freshair">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2010/05/27/126395459/billie-joe-armstrong-from-green-day-to-broadway|title=Billie Joe Armstrong, From Green Day To Broadway|last=Chavez|first=Marina|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref>

While performing at the 1998 [[KROQ Weenie Roast]] in Irvine, California, [[Third Eye Blind]] bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and "[[Bear hug|bear-hugged]]" Dirnt, who was caught off-guard.<ref name="Meyer153154">Meyer, 2006. pp. 153-154</ref>  The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar was taken away by security.  After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull.<ref name="Meyer153154"/>  Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind.<ref name="Meyer153154"/>  Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply had too much to drink and made a very bad decision.  If I had been in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him and I hope he recovers quickly."<ref name="Meyer153154"/>

"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" appeared in numerous events of popular culture, including a scene involving the death of a cancer patient on the medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' and [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|the series finale]] of the sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'' in 1998.<ref name="Myers152153">Myers, 2006. pp. 152-153</ref>  The finale of ''Seinfeld'' attracted record figures of 100 million viewers, and has been deemed "the most talked about show finale" in US television history.<ref name="Myers152153"/>
