'''Paestum''' is the classical Roman name of a major Graeco-Roman city in the [[Campania]] region of [[Italy]]. It is located in the north of [[Cilento]], near the coast about 85&nbsp;km SE of [[Naples]] in the province of [[Salerno]], and belongs to the commune of [[Capaccio]], officially also named Capaccio-Paestum.

==Geography==
Paestum is situated close to the [[Tyrrhenian Sea|tyrrhenian]] coast on the road linking [[Agropoli]] to [[Battipaglia]]. Its population is mainly located in the quarters surrounding the ancient Graeco-Roman ruins, as Santa Venere (to the south, near the hamlet of [[Licinella]]), Andreoli (north) and Torre di Paestum (west, by the sea). The town also has a [[Paestum railway station|railway station]] on the [[Salerno-Reggio Calabria railway line|Naples-Salerno-Reggio Calabria line]].

==History==
[[File:Samnite_soldiers_from_a_tomb_frieze_in_Nola_4th_century_BCE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Samnite]] soldiers, from a tomb frieze found in Nola, [[Province of Naples]], 4th century BCE.</br>(Note that this fresco is not from Paestum.)]]
Founded around the end of the 7th century BC<ref>The earliest Greek pottery found at Paestum sites dates ca 600 BC. Greco, "Qualche riflessioni ancora sulle origini di Poseidionia ''DialArch'' '''1''' (1979) pp53-54.</ref> by colonists from the [[Greece|Greek]] city of [[Sybaris]], and originally known as '''Poseidonia.''' Outside of archaeological evidence very little is known about Paestum during its first centuries. Archaeological evidence indicates that the city was expanding with the building of roads, temples and other features of a growing city. Coinage, architecture and molded votive figurines all attest to close relations maintained with [[Metaponto]] in the sixth and fifth centuries. It is not until the end of the fifth century BC that the city is mentioned, when according to [[Strabo]] the city was conquered by the [[Lucani (ancient people)|Lucani]]. From the archaeological evidence it appears that the two cultures, Greek and Oscan, were able to get together and thrive. What is known is it later became the Roman city of Paestum in 273 BC after the Graeco-Italian Poseidonians sided with the loser, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], in war against [[Rome]] during the first quarter of the third century BC.

During the invasion of Italy by [[Hannibal]] the city remained faithful to Rome and afterwards was granted special favours such as the minting of its coinage. The city continued to prosper during the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]], but started to go into decline between the 4th and 7th centuries. It was abandoned during the [[Middle Ages]] and its ruins only came to notice again in the 18th century, following the rediscovery of the Roman cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. The decline and desertion were probably due to changes in local land drainage patterns, leading to swampy [[malaria]]l conditions (this is difficult to picture, with the present aridity; the site is now left to [[lizard]]s and a few tourists).

On September 9, 1943, Paestum was the location of the landing beaches of the [[U.S. 36th Infantry Division]] during the [[Allied]] [[Operation Avalanche|invasion of Italy]]. [[Germany|German]] forces resisted the landings from the outset, causing heavy fighting within and around the town. Combat persisted around the town for nine days before the Germans withdrew to the north.

==Overview==
[[File:Map of Paestum 1732 .JPG|thumb|left|Map of Paestum by [[Costantino Gatta]], 1732]]
The main features of the site today are the standing remains of three major temples in [[Doric order|Doric]] style, dating from the first half of the 6th century BC. These were dedicated to [[Hera]] and [[Athena]], although they have traditionally been identified as a [[basilica]] and temples of [[Poseidon|Neptune]] and [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], owing to 18th-century mis-attribution.

The city of Paestum covers an area of approximately 120 hectares. It is only the 25 hectares that contain the three main temples that have been excavated. The other 95 hectares remain on private land and have not been excavated. The city is surrounded by defensive walls that still stand. The walls are approximately 4750 m long, 5 <U+2013> 7 m thick and 15 m high. Positioned along the wall are 24 square and round towers. There may have been up to 28 but some of them were destroyed during the construction of highway in 18th century that effectively cuts the site in two.

The modern town of Paestum, directly to the north of the archaeological site, is a popular seaside resort. In the region of Paestum there are long, sandy beaches.

==Historic buildings==
[[Image:Temple of Hera (c).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Temple of Hera]]
The '''[[Temple of Neptune, Paestum|temple of Hera]]''', built around 550 BC by Greek colonists, is the oldest surviving temple in Paestum. Eighteenth-century archaeologists named it "The Basilica" because they mistakenly believed it to be a Roman building. A basilica in Roman times was a civil building, not a religious one. Inscriptions revealed that the goddess worshiped here was [[Hera]]. Later, an [[altar]] was unearthed in front of the temple, in the open-air site usual for a Greek altar; the faithful could attend rites and [[sacrifice]]s without entering the [[cella]].

Just south of the city walls, at a site still called '''Santa Venera''', a series of small [[terracotta]] [[offertory]] molded statuettes of a standing female nude wearing the ''[[polos]]'' headdress of Anatolian and Syrian goddesses, which were dated to the first half of the sixth century BC, were found in the sanctuary; other similar ones have been excavated at other Paestum sanctuaries during excavations in the 1980s, but the figure is highly unusual in the Western Mediterranean.<ref>Rebecca Miller Ammerman, "The Naked Standing Goddess: A Group of Archaic Terracotta Figurines from Paestum", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''95'''.2 (April 1991), pp. 203-230.</ref> The open-air ''[[temenos]]'' was established at the start of Greek occupation: a temple on the site was not built until the early fifth century. A nude goddess is a figure alien to Greek culture before [[Praxiteles]]' famous [[Cnidian Aphrodite]] in the fourth century: iconographic analogies must be sought in Phoenician [[Astarte]] and the Cypriote Aphrodite. "In places where the Greeks and Phoenicians came in contact with one another, there is often an overlapping in the persona of the two deities," Rebecca Miller Ammerman has explained (Ammerman 1991), in identifying the cult at the site as that of Phoenician Astarte or Cypriot Aphrodite. In Roman times, inscriptions make clear, the cult was reserved to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].
[[Image:Temple of Apollo28.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Second temple of Hera]]
[[Image:Plan of the Temple of Poseidon at Paestum.png|thumb|right|200px|Plan of the second temple of Hera.]]
The nearby temple, the second '''temple of Hera''', was built in about 450 BC. It has been in the past variously thought of as a temple dedicated to [[Poseidon]]. There are visible on the east side the remains of two altars, one large and one smaller. The smaller one is a Roman addition, built when they cut through the larger one to build a road to the [[forum (Roman)|forum]]. It is also possible that the temple was originally dedicated to both Hera and [[Zeus]]; some offertory statues found around the larger altar are thought to demonstrate this identification.

In the central part of the complex is the '''Roman [[forum (Roman)|Forum]]''', thought to have been built on the site of the preceding Greek [[agora]]. On the north side of the forum is a small Roman temple, dated to around 200 BC. It was dedicated to the [[Capitoline Triad]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]].

To the north-west of the forum is the '''[[amphitheater]]'''. This is of normal Roman pattern, though much smaller than later examples. Only the southern half is visible; in 1930 AD, a road was built across the site, burying the northern half. It is said by local inhabitants that the civil engineer responsible was tried, convicted and received a prison sentence for what was described as wanton destruction of an historic site.
[[File:Temple of Athena at Paestum.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Temple of Athena]]
On the highest point of the town, some way from the other temples, is the '''temple of Athena'''. It was built in about 500 BC, and was for some time incorrectly thought to have been dedicated to Ceres. The architecture is transitional, being partly in the Ionic mode and partly early Doric. Three mediaeval Christian tombs in the floor show that the temple was at one time used as a [[Christian]] church.

All three temples have undergone some renovation and repair in recent years. Close access is allowed, but entry by visitors into the buildings is no longer permitted.

==Painted tombs==
[[Image:The Tomb of the Diver - Paestum - Italy.JPG|thumb|250px|left|The ceiling painting]]
[[Image:Symposiumnorthwall.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The symposium on the north wall]]

Paestum is also renowned for its painted tombs, mainly belonging to the period of the [[Lucania]]n rule, while only one of them dates to the Greek period. It was found, on 3 June 1968, in a small [[necropolis]] some 1,5&nbsp;km south of the ancient walls. The burial monument was named '''[[Tomb of the Diver]]''' (Italian: ''Tomba del tuffatore'') after the enigmatic scene, depicted on the covering slab, of a lonely young man diving into a stream of water. It was dated to the first half of the fifth century BC (about 470 BC), the ''[[Golden Age (metaphor)|Golden Age]]'' of the Greek town. The tomb is painted with the ''[[Fresco|true fresco]]'' technique and its importance lies in being "the only example of Greek painting with figured scenes dating from the [[Orientalizing]], [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]], or [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods to survive in its entirety. Among the thousands of Greek tombs known from this time (roughly 700<U+2013>400 BC), this is the only one to have been decorated with frescoes of human subjects."<ref>Holloway. ''The Tomb of the Diver'', cit., p. 365.</ref>
The remaining four walls of the tombs are occupied by [[symposium]] related scenes, an iconography far more familiar from the [[Greek pottery]], than the diving scene.

All the five frescoes are visible in the local National Museum, together with the cycle of Lucanian painted tombs.
