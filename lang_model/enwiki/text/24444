'''''Britney''''' is the self-titled third [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]]. It was released on November 5, 2001 by [[Jive Records]]. Looking to transition from the [[teen pop]] styles of her earlier albums ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Spears began to embrace a maturer sound with her next studio effort. Its music incorporates elements of [[Pop music|pop]] with [[dance pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] influences; its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300|title=Britney - Britney Spears|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=''[[Allmusic]]''|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]].<ref name="Credits">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300/credits|title=Britney - Britney Spears: Credits|work=''Allmusic''|publisher=Rovi Corporation|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Spears herself assumed a more prominent role in the album's development, co-writing five of its tracks.

Upon its release, ''Britney'' received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented the progression from Spears's earlier works, but criticized her increasingly provocative image. The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 745,000 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth record ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003). To promote the album, Spears embarked on the [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]], which began in November 2001 and continued through July 2002. The album received a [[2003 Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]].<ref name="Nominations">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Complete-list-of-Grammy-nominees-ceremony-set-2687689.php|title=Complete list of Grammy nominees; ceremony set for Feb. 23|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=January 8, 2003|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>

Six singles were released from the album, all of which proved less successful than those of Spears's prior records. Consequentially, ''Britney'' became her first record not to yield a US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top ten hit. Its [[lead single]] "[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]" peaked at number twenty-seven on the chart, while follow-up singles "[[Overprotected]]", "[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]", "[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll#Britney Spears version|I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]", "[[Anticipating]]", and "[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]" reached the lower end of the chart and its extension, the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]].

When recording her follow-up record, Spears wanted an "older generation to pick up on it", adding that she "had to change it up and pray people think that's cool". She stated that she chose to self-title the album because the majority of its content describes who she is. Spears recorded twenty-three tracks for the release, several of which she co-wrote with the assistance of [[Brian Kierulf]] and [[Josh Schwartz]]. She added that personally writing the album and developing its concept made the project "that much more special", elaborating of her intentions to "get better and grow" as a songwriter.<ref name="MTVBackground">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1450334/britney-reflects-britney.jhtml|title=Britney Says Britney Reflects Who Britney Is|author=Corey Moss|work=''[[MTV News]]''|publisher=[[Viacom]]|date=October 25, 2001|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref>

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, ''Britney'' received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 58, which indicates "mixed or average reviews", based on 13 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic"/> David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' found Spears's increasingly provocative image to be unnatural, noting "virginal vamping in an awkward adolescence" and "a few tentative new moves".<ref name="EntertainmentWeekly"/> [[PopMatters]]'s Nikki Tranton complimented the production of the songs, but questioned if Spears was ready to establish herself as a grown woman in the music industry.<ref name="PopMatters"/>

[[Allmusic]]'s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a positive review, feeling that the album "strives to deepen [Spears's] persona" and proves she "will know what to do when the teen-pop phenomenon of 1999-2001 passes for good".<ref name="Allmusic"/> Similarly, a reviewer from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented that the project was "a nicely varied, wholly satisfying collection".<ref name="Billboard"/> ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Ted Kessler recognized the release as a "coming of age album" and joked that it "works best when making a good pop cheese and dance sandwich".<ref name="NME"/> In contrast, Stephen Thompson of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' panned the album, opining that the music "just [isn't] catchy" and that "though neither a girl nor a woman, Spears inspires grown-up anger on her own".<ref name="TheAVClub"/>
