'''Edmund Christopher "Ed" Joyce''' (born [[22 September]] [[1978]] in [[Dublin]]) is an [[Ireland|Irish-born]] [[England|English]] [[cricketer]].

Ed Joyce was educated at the Presentation College at [[Bray, County Wicklow]] and [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. He is one of the best [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] cricketers of recent years. A left-handed batsman and occasional right-arm bowler of medium pace, Joyce made his [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] debut in [[1999]] and won the [[NBC Denis Compton Award]] in 2000. He has been a regular member of the first team since [[2002]], in which year he [[batting average|averaged]] 51 and scored four hundreds. Joyce replaced [[Owais Shah]] as acting county captain midway through the [[2004]] season, but was not appointed for the [[2005]] season.

Joyce played a number of matches for [[Irish cricket team|Ireland]] in the [[ICC Trophy]], averaging over 70 in the competition, but in July [[2005]] qualified to play for [[English cricket team|England]] by virtue of his residency there; should his form continue it is possible that he may one day play [[Test cricket]] for England.  In October 2005, Joyce was selected for the England cricket academy and gained a spot in the England "A" squad to tour the West Indies in Spring 2006. In June 2006 he was selected in the England ODI squad for the series with Sri Lanka. He made his England ODI debut against Ireland in Stormont Park, Belfast in June 2006. The Irish team included his younger brother, [[Dominick Joyce|Dominick]]. Two days later, he represented England in his first [[Twenty20]] international, but sprained his ankle and could be out for two to six weeks, although England's chief medical officer said the day after the injury that "it is too early to determine" how long he would be out.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/5086858.stm  Joyce must wait for ankle verdict], from BBC Sport, published on [[17 June]] [[2006]]</ref>. He made his return for Middlesex at Edgbaston on 14th July 2006, in the County Championship against Warwickshire, scoring a career-best 211 in the first innings.

Joyce's brothers Augustine and Dominick have also played for the Irish men's team, while his twin sisters, Isobel and Cecelia, have played for the [[Irish women's cricket team|Irish women]], turning up at the [[2005 Women's Cricket World Cup|2005 World Cup]].
