'''Interstate 80''' (abbreviated '''I-80''') is the second-longest [[Interstate Highway]] in the [[United States]]. It connects downtown [[San Francisco, California]] to [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], a suburb of [[New York City]], just as the [[Lincoln Highway]] did in the years before the Interstate Highway System. The highway roughly traces some historically significant travel corridors, particularly in the [[Western U.S.]] These include the [[Oregon Trail]] in [[Nebraska]] and westward, the [[California Trail]] in [[Nevada]] and [[California]], and the [[Union Pacific]] [[Transcontinental Railroad]] from western Nebraska to San Francisco.

The highway from near [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] east to near [[Youngstown, Ohio]] is a [[toll road]] - the end-to-end [[Indiana Toll Road]] and [[Ohio Turnpike]]. At Youngstown I-80 leaves the tolled alignment, which continues towards New York, in favor of the [[Keystone Shortway]], a shortcut across northern Pennsylvania built as part of a new corridor for I-80. The tolled route to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] was originally designated [[Interstate 80S (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 80S]], and is now [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]].

I-80 intersects [[Interstate 90|I-90]] near [[Elyria, Ohio]] and they share a route west all the way to [[Portage, Indiana]], where I-90 splits off but I-80 then runs concurrently with [[Interstate 94|I-94]] until the Chicago suburb of [[South Holland, Illinois]]. I-80 then runs concurrently with [[Interstate 294|I-294]] until [[Markham, Illinois]].

=== California ===
[[Image:Interstate80westernend.jpg|thumbnail|350px|Where Interstate 80 begins, in [[San Francisco, California]]]]
{{main|Interstate 80 in California}}
{{seealso|San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge|Carquinez Bridge|Al Zampa Bridge}}
A portion of the route through [[Pinole, California]] involved the experimental transplantation of the [[rare species]] [[Santa Cruz tarweed]] in the right-of-way.

=== Nevada ===
{{main|Interstate 80 in Nevada}}
In the state of [[Nevada]], Interstate 80 runs northeast from the [[Lake Tahoe]] region near [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] to [[Battle Mountain, Nevada|Battle Mountain]]. At Battle Mountain, it turns east to the salt flats of Utah via [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]]. In Nevada, I-80 is routed along the [[Truckee River|Truckee]] and [[Humboldt River|Humboldt]] rivers.

The stretch of I-80 through Nevada is largely desolate and mountainous. Services are limited compared to I-80 in other states.

=== Utah ===
After crossing [[Utah]]'s western border, I-80 runs through the desolate [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] west of the [[Great Salt Lake]]. The longest stretch in between exits on an Interstate Highway is located between [[Wendover, Utah|Wendover]] and Knolls, with 37 miles (60 km) between those exits.

East of the salt flats, I-80 passes through [[Salt Lake City]], where it merges with [[I-15]] for three miles before entering the [[Wasatch Mountains]] east of the city. It ascends [[Parley's Canyon]] and passes within a few miles of [[Park City]] as it follows a route through the mountains towards [[Wyoming]].

The route of the Utah section of I-80 is defined at Utah Code Annotated <U+00A7> 72-4-113(10).[http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE72/htm/72_04015.htm]

=== Wyoming ===
In the state of [[Wyoming]], I-80 reaches a maximum elevation of 8,640 feet (2,633 m) above [[sea level]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] and [[Laramie, Wyoming]].  Farther west in Wyoming, the interstate passes the [[Continental Divide]] twice because two lines of mountains form a closed-off basin.

=== Nebraska ===
The longest straight stretch of interstate anywhere in the system is the approximately 72 miles of I-80 occurring between Exit 318 and milemarker 390 in [[Nebraska]].  Along this length the road does not vary from an ideally straight line by more than a few yards.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The western portion of I-80 in Nebraska runs very close to the state of [[Colorado]], without entering the state; the intersection of [[Interstate 76 (west)|Interstate 76]] and I-80 is visible from the Colorado-Nebraska state line.

Part of Interstate 80 in Nebraska is marked as a [[Blue Star Memorial Highway]].

=== Iowa ===
In the state of [[Iowa]], Interstate 80 runs from the I-80 bridge over the [[Missouri River]] east to the [[Quad Cities]] and the [[Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Mississippi River]]. It is the main east-west arterial freeway through southern Iowa.

I-80 serves the cities of [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], and [[Davenport, IA|Davenport]].

=== Illinois ===
{{main|Interstate 80 in Illinois}}
{{seealso|Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge|Des Plaines River Bridge|Tri-State Tollway}}
In the state of [[Illinois]], I-80 runs from the Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge across the [[Mississippi River]] south to an intersection with [[Interstate 74]]. It then runs due east across north-central Illinois just north of the [[Illinois River]] to [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]]. I-80 continues east and joins [[Interstate 94]] just before entering the state of Indiana.

The portion of I-80 that runs concurrent with [[Interstate 294]] is a part of the Tri-State Tollway.

=== Indiana ===
{{main|Borman Expressway|Indiana Toll Road}}
In the state of [[Indiana]], I-80 runs concurrent with another Interstate highway for its entire length. It runs with I-94 on the Borman Expressway before joining I-90 to Ohio on the Indiana Toll Road.

The portion of I-80 between [[La Porte, Indiana]] and [[Toledo, Ohio]] runs (with I-90) within ten miles (16 km) of the [[Michigan]] state line. From the [[State Road 9 (Indiana)|State Road 9]] and I-80 intersection, the sign marking the Indiana-Michigan state line is visible. At another point in northern Indiana, I-80 comes within about 200 yards (meters) from the Michigan border.[http://terraserver-usa.com/image.aspx?S=12&T=2&X=810&Y=5780&Z=16&W=2]

=== Ohio ===
{{main|Interstate 80 in Ohio}}
{{seealso|Ohio Turnpike}}
In the state of [[Ohio]], I-80 enters with I-90 from the Indiana Toll Road and immediately becomes the "James W. Shocknessy Ohio Turnpike", more commonly referred to as simply the Ohio Turnpike. The two Interstates cross rural northwest Ohio and run just south of the metropolitan area of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]. 

In [[Lorain, Ohio|Lorain]], just west of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], I-90 splits from I-80 and runs northeast as a freeway. I-80 runs east-southeast through the southern suburbs of Cleveland and retains the Ohio Turnpike designation. Just northwest of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], the Ohio Turnpike continues southeast onto [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]], while I-80 runs east to the north of Youngstown, entering Pennsylvania south of [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]].

=== Pennsylvania ===
{{main|Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania}}
In the state of [[Pennsylvania]], I-80 is the main east-west Interstate-standard highway through central Pennsylvania. It runs from the Ohio state line near [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]] to the [[Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge]] over the [[Delaware River]].

I-80 serves no major metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania directly. Spurs from I-80 run to [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], [[Williamsport, Pennsylvania|Williamsport]], [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]].  I-80 intersects [[Interstate 79|I-79]] in Western Pennsylvania which connects with [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] (about 75 miles to the north) and [[Pittsburgh]] (about 55 miles to the south). Interstate 80's highest point (east of the Mississippi) is also located in Pennsylvania, at Exit 111 near Penfield.

=== New Jersey ===
{{main|Interstate 80 in New Jersey}}
The portion of 80 that goes through [[New Jersey]] is sometimes called the ''Bergen-Passaic Expressway.''

I-80 does not go all the way to [[New York City]] via the [[George Washington Bridge]]. Its designated end is about four miles (6.4 km) short of New York City in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]]. There, it joins and becomes designated as [[Interstate 95|I-95]], which does cross the bridge.  This has led to some confusion because this I-95 segment is also signed with "TO I-80" signs heading southbound from the George Washington Bridge, and many maps show this section as I-80/95. The tolled section of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ends at exit 18, which is actually just the toll plaza at the northern terminus. The next exit on I-95 is exit 68, which is consistent with the exit numbering on I-80. (The truth is that the exit numbers on this section of I-95 match the mile markers on I-95 had the [[Somerset Freeway]] been built. The fact that they are similar to what the exit numbers are on I-80 is just a coincidence.)

==Auxiliary routes==
{{main|Auxiliary routes of Interstate 80}}
{{3di|80}}

<!--- I don't really see the value of this section, but I'll just comment it out... User:Lpangelrob * Among many picturesque sections of I-80 are the crossing of San Francisco Bay over the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]] (toll paid westbound only), the view of the Golden Gate from [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], the traverse above [[Donner Pass]] and [[Donner Lake]] (near [[Lake Tahoe]]) in California, and its run along the [[Truckee River]] both west and east of [[Reno, Nevada]]. Interstate 80 crosses the southern end of [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] west of [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], providing views of various mountains, although it incorporates a very long stretch of straight roadway that can induce some drivers to fall asleep.  Also in that category, is the stretch of I-80 from east of Rock Springs, WY to Laramie, WY (around 200 miles).  It passes through the Red Desert just prior to Rawlins and is always very windy.  --->
