'''Somerset West''' ({{lang-af|Somerset-Wes}}) is a town in the [[Western Cape]], [[South Africa]]. Organisationally and administratively it is included in the [[City of Cape Town]] [[metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan municipality]].  It is situated in the [[Helderberg]] area (formerly called Hottentots Holland), about {{convert|50|km|mi|sigfig=1}} east of [[Cape Town]] central city area, and {{convert|10|km|mi|0}} from [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]].
The town is overlooked by the [[Helderberg]] (meaning "clear mountain"), a part of the [[Hottentots-Holland]] range of mountains.
The vehicle registration code for Somerset West is ''CFM'' and the post code is 7130 for street addresses, and 7129 for post office boxes.

== History ==
[[File:SAHRA-9 2 083 0016-Old Lourens River Bridge-wide-20120903.jpg|thumb|The Old Lourens River Bridge is a provincial heritage site.]]

The land was initially bought from local people and a cattle post was established here by Dutch soldiers in 1672.
 
A town developed around the Lourens River (originally "Tweederivier", which means "Second River"; "Eersterivier", meaning "First River" passes through [[Stellenbosch]], some 16&nbsp;km to the north) and the farm of [[Vergelegen]] (Dutch: "remotely situated"), an 18th-century farmhouse built in the historic [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch style]] by [[Willem Adriaan van der Stel]], governor of the Cape and son of [[Simon van der Stel]], who gave his name to the nearby town of [[Stellenbosch]]. Willem Adriaan was later sent back to Holland after being charged with corruption and cruelty towards local Dutch farmers. The farm is now owned by a subsidiary of the large mining company [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]], who have restored the farmhouse to its original magnificence and continue to produce some of South Africa's best wines there. The farm is open to tourists.

The town was named Somerset after an [[England|English]] governor of the [[Cape Colony]] during the 1800s, [[Lord Charles Henry Somerset]], with the suffix 'West' being added after 1825 to differentiate it from [[Somerset East]], another South African town in the Eastern Cape. In the 1830s, [[Sir Lowry's Pass]], named after later governor [[Sir Lowry Cole]], was constructed to link the town with outposts further east over the [[Hottentots-Holland]] mountains.

In the 1960s, the [[AECI]] factory between Somerset West and [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] was the second largest dynamite factory in the world.

==Local attractions==
Somerset West has a fairly decorative display of [[Christmas]] lights erected atop the street lights of the Main Road. The Helderberg Lights Festival (aka the Strawberry Festival), a flea market and parade, normally complements these lights. 

The area also has its own community radio station, [[Radio Helderberg]], broadcasting community notices and playing adult orientated pop music.

The [http://www.helderbergnaturereserve.co.za/ Helderberg Nature Reserve], a 363 hectare natural wildlife preserve opened in 1964, contains a wide variety of smaller fauna (buck, tortoises and other reptiles) and outstanding specimens of indigenous flora such as [[protea]] and [[fynbos]]. 

The Vergelegen Wine Estate lies just outside the town itself.  The buildings on the estate constitute fine examples of [[Cape Dutch architecture]].

The [[Lwandle Migrant Labour Museum]] is located in [[Lwandle]] Township and is dedicated to the history of Black migrant workers in the area during the [[apartheid]] era.  Is is one of only a few museums in South Africa that covers this aspect of the country's history.

Somerset West contains a number of sporting facilities including several golf courses.

The historic town of [[Stellenbosch]] is reachable via the R44 motorway (approx 18&nbsp;km/11&nbsp;mi away). The area between Somerset West and Stellenbosch also encompasses many vineyards and wineries (e.g. [[Rust-en-Vrede]], [[Lourensford]], Alto, J.P. Bredell) where visitors can sample and purchase wine. The oldest remaining vineyard in South Africa, [[Vergelegen]], is situated on the outskirts of Somerset West.

In recent years many guest houses and B&Bs have opened up in Somerset West, since it is conveniently located for [[Cape Town]] ({{convert|40|km|mi}} away on the N2 motorway), the beaches at the [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]], as well as the Western Cape's numerous wine farms.
