'''James Vincent Forrestal''' ([[February 15]], [[1892]] &ndash; [[May 22]], [[1949]]) was a [[Secretary of the Navy]] and the first [[United States]] [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. 
Forrestal's death resulted from a fall out of a [[Bethesda Naval Hospital]] window which has led to speculation and much [[conspiracy theory|controversy]].  He was a supporter of naval [[carrier battle group|battle groups]] centered on [[aircraft carrier]]s.  In 1954, the Navy's first [[supercarrier]] was named the [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)|USS ''Forrestal'']] in his honor.

==Early life and career==
Forrestal was born in Matteawan, now [[Beacon, New York]], the son of an Irish immigrant who dabbled in politics.  After graduating from [[high school]] at the age of 16 in 1908, he spent the next three years working for a trio of newspapers: the ''[[Matteawan Evening Journal]]'', the ''[[Mount Vernon Argus]]'' and the ''[[Poughkeepsie News Press]]''. 

Forrestal entered [[Dartmouth College]] in 1911, but transferred to [[Princeton University]] the following year.  At the latter school, he served as an editor for ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' and was voted by the senior class as "Most Likely to Succeed", but left just prior to completing work on a degree.  

After college, Forrestal went to work as a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] [[sales]]man for William A. Read and Company (also known as Dillon, Read and Company).  When [[World War I]] broke out, he enlisted in the Navy and ultimately became a [[military aviation|Naval Aviator]], training with the Royal Flying Corps in Canada.  During the final year of the war, Forrestal spent much of his time in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the office of Naval Operations, while completing his flight training.  He eventually reached the rank of [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]].

Following the war, Forrestal served as a publicist for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] committee in [[Dutchess County]], New York helping politicians from the area win elections at both the state and national level.  One of those individuals aided by his work was a neighbor, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

Forrestal then returned to William A. Read and Company, earning a partnership, in 1923, before eventually becoming [[president]] of the company in 1937. 

By most accounts, Forrestal was a compulsive workaholic who was very cold and neglectful towards his family.  One instance of this trait came when Forrestal, while working in England, received a phone call from his two sons, ages eight and six.  The two had missed their plane in [[Paris]], but Forrestal simply told the boys to work out the problem themselves and meet him in [[London]]. His wife, the former Josephine Ogden, a [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] writer whom he married in 1926, also was a victim of this treatment and eventually developed alcohol and mental problems inherited from her mother.

President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] appointed Forrestal as an administrative assistant on [[June 22]], [[1940]], then nominated him as [[Undersecretary of the Navy|Under Secretary of the Navy]] six weeks later.  In the latter post, Forrestal would prove to be very effective at mobilizing industrial production for the war effort.  

He became [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] on [[May 19]], [[1944]], following the death of his immediate supervisor [[Frank Knox]] from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].  Forrestal then led the Navy through the closing year of the war and the demobilization that followed.  What might have been his greatest legacy as Navy Secretary was an attempt that came to nought.  He, along with [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] and Under Secretary of State [[Joseph Grew]], in the early months of 1945, strongly advocated a softer policy toward Japan that would permit a negotiated face-saving surrender.  His primary concern was "the menace of Russian [[Communism]] and its attraction for decimated, destabilized societies in Europe and Asia," and, therefore, keeping the [[Soviet Union]] out of the war with [[Japan]]. Had his advice been followed, Japan might well have surrendered before August 1945, precluding the use of the [[atomic bomb]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] <ref name="Hoopes">Hoopes and Brinkley, pp. 205-214.  The quoted line is from p. 208</ref>.  So strongly did he feel about this matter that he cultivated negotiation attempts that bordered closely on insubordination toward the President.

Forrestal opposed the unification of the services, but even so helped develop the [[National Security Act of 1947]] that created the [[National Military Establishment]] (the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] was not created as such until August 1949).  With the former [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Robert P. Patterson]] retiring to private life, Forrestal was the next choice.

His 18 months at Defense came at an exceptionally difficult time for the U.S. military establishment: Communist governments came to power in [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[China]]; [[West Berlin]] was blockaded, necessitating the [[Berlin Airlift]] to keep it going; the war between the Arab states and [[Israel]] after the establishment of Israel in Palestine; and negotiations were going on for the formation of [[NATO]]. His reign was also hampered by intense [[interservice rivalries]]. 

In addition, President Harry Truman constrained military budgets billions of dollars below what the services were requesting, putting Forrestal in the middle of the tug-of-war. Forrestal was also becoming more and more worried about the Soviet threat <ref name="Chambers">See [[Whittaker Chambers]] to confirm that his concerns on the domestic front were quite legitimate</ref>.  Internationally, the takeover by the Communists of Eastern Europe, their threats to the governments of Greece, Italy, and France, their impending takeover of China, and the invasion of South Korea by North Korea would demonstrate the legitimacy of his concerns on the international front as well.

Forrestal is alleged to be an original member of a group formed in 1947 with the purported code name of [[Majestic 12]].

==Death==
Although Forrestal had told associates he had decided to resign, when Truman abruptly asked for his resignation he was shattered. His letter of resignation was tendered after Truman's dismissal on [[March 28]], [[1949]].  On the day of his removal from office, he went into a sort of strange daze and was flown on a Navy airplane to the estate of Under Secretary of State [[Robert A. Lovett]] in Hobe Sound, Florida, where Forrestal's wife, Josephine, was vacationing.  He was checked into the [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda Naval Hospital]] five days later.  The condition was officially announced as "nervous and physical exhaustion"; his lead doctor, Captain George Raines, diagnosing his condition as "depression" or "reactive depression."

A chief reason for Forrestal's fragile mental state was that his high-profile position was in sharp contrast to his personality{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  As a person who prized anonymity and once stated that his hobby was "obscurity", he and his policies had been the constant target of attacks from columnists, including [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] and [[Walter Winchell]].  Pearson's protege, [[Jack Anderson]], later asserted that Pearson "hectored Forrestal with innuendos and false accusations." <ref name="Akashah">{{cite journal

Forrestal seemed to be on the road to recovery, having regained 12 pounds since his entry into the hospital. However, in the early morning hours of [[May 22]], his body was found on a third-floor roof below the 16th-floor kitchen across the hall from his room. The [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], county coroner called it a [[suicide]] within hours of the death.  

The official Navy review board, which completed hearings on [[May 31]], waited until [[October 12]], [[1949]], to release only a brief summary of its findings.  The announcement stated only that Forrestal had died from his fall from the window. It did not say what might have caused the fall, nor did it make any mention of the bathrobe sash that was tied around his neck. There were reports of [[paranoia]] and of involuntary commitment to the hospital, as well as suspicions about the detailed circumstances of his death, which have fed a variety of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], some of which are described below. One of Forrestal's statements described as "paranoid" was his prediction that the United States would soon be at war; a few months later the US was indeed at war in [[Korean war|Korea]].<ref name="Akashah"/>  

His alleged [[suicide note]] was part of a poem from [[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'': 
:''Fair Salamis, the billows<U+2019> roar,''
:''Wander around thee yet,''
:''And sailors gaze upon thy shore'' 
:''Firm in the Ocean set.'' 
:''Thy son is in a foreign clime'' 
:''Where Ida feeds her countless flocks,'' 
:''Far from thy dear, remembered rocks,'' 
:''Worn by the waste of time<U+2013> ''
:''Comfortless, nameless, hopeless save''
:''In the dark prospect of the yawning grave....''
:''Woe to the mother in her close of day,''
:''Woe to her desolate heart and temples gray,''
:''When she shall hear''
:''Her loved one<U+2019>s story whispered in her ear!''
:''<U+201C>Woe, woe!<U+2019> will be the cry<U+2013>''
:''No quiet murmur like the tremulous wail''
:''Of the lone bird, the querulous nightingale<U+2013>''

The actual note [http://www.dcdave.com/article4/041103.html] was not released by the Department of the Navy until April 2004.

James Forrestal is buried in section 30 of [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

===A Conspiracy?===
Doubts have existed from the beginning about Forrestal's alleged suicide. These were fueled by the fact that the Navy did not release the transcript of its official hearing.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}  The early doubts are detailed in the book ''The Death of James Forrestal'' (1966) by Cornell Simpson, which received virtually no publicity. Additional doubt has been raised by the 2004 release of the Navy investigation, informally referred to as the [http://www.princeton.edu/~mudd/finding_aids/willcutts/ Willcutts Report], after [[Admiral Morton D. Willcutts]], the head of the [[National Naval Medical Center]], who convened the review board.

Among the discrepancies between the report and the accounts given in the principal Forrestal biographies are that the transcription of the poem by Sophocles appears to many to have been written in a hand other than Forrestal's, and there was broken glass found on Forrestal's bed, a fact that had not been previously reported.  Theories as to who might have murdered Forrestal range from Soviet agents -- a view championed by [[Joseph McCarthy]] -- to U.S. government operatives sent to silence him for what he knew about [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s. 

Forrestal himself maintained that he was being tracked and bugged by [[Zionism|Zionist]] operatives. As Forrestal biographer Arnold Rogow puts it: {{Quote|"...Forrestal, during his last months in office, harbored a conviction that he was under day-and-night surveillance by Zionist agents; and when he resigned as Secretary of Defense in March, 1949, he was convinced that his resignation was not unrelated to pressures brought to bear on the Administration by American [[Jew]]ish organizations."|Arnold Rogow|James Forrestal, A Study of Personality, Politics, and Policy, p.181}}  

Rogow footnotes this passage, noting:  

{{Quote|"While those beliefs reflect the fact that Forrestal was a very ill man in March 1949, it is entirely possible that he was 'shadowed' by Zionist agents in 1947 and 1948.  A close associate of his at the time recalls that at the height of the [[Palestine]] controversy, his (the associate's) official limousine was followed to and from his office by a blue sedan containing two men.  When the police were notified and the sedan apprehended, it was discovered that the two men were photographers employed by a Zionist organization.  They explained to the police that they had hoped to obtain photographs of the limousine's occupant entering or leaving an [[Arab]] embassy in order to demonstrate that the official involved was in close contact with Arab representatives."|Arnold Rogow|James Forrestal, A Study of Personality, Politics, and Policy, p.181}}

New light was shed on Forrestal's concerns in March 2006 when ''[[The Times]]'' of London, referencing newly declassified documents, revealed that a serious attempt by [[Menachem Begin]]'s Irgun Gang to [http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article12205.htm assassinate] Britain's anti-Zionist counterpart to Forrestal, Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]], had been thwarted by British intelligence in 1946.  Forrestal had been the most conspicuous and forceful anti-Zionist in the Truman administration.

There was also a press campaign against Forrestal, led by columnist Drew Pearson. The campaign tried to make it appear that he was paranoid.  Paranoia, however, was never mentioned in the official evaluations of his psychiatric state. One of Pearson's most spectacular claims was that while Forrestal was at [[Hobe Sound, Florida]], shortly before he was hospitalized, he was awakened by a siren in the middle of the night and ran out into the street exclaiming, "The Russians are attacking."  This claim has not been confirmed by anyone who was there that night, and was described as a fabrication by Captain George Raines, the Navy doctor in charge of Forrestal's treatment<ref name="Hoopes2">Hopes and Brinkley, pp. 455-456</ref>
