== Early life, teaching, and marriage ==
Kosi<U+0144>ski, who was Jewish, was born J<U+00F3>zef Lewinkopf in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], Poland.  As a child during [[World War II]], he lived in central Poland under a false identity, Jerzy Kosi<U+0144>ski, which his father gave to him. A [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] issued him a forged [[baptism]]al certificate. The Kosi<U+0144>ski family survived the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] thanks to local villagers who offered [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|assistance to Jewish Poles]], often at great personal risk (the penalty in [[Occupation of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] being death). Kosi<U+0144>ski's father received help not only from town leaders and churchmen, but also from individuals such as Marianna Pasiowa, a member of the underground network helping Jews evade capture. The family lived openly in [[D<U+0105>browa Rzeczycka]] near [[Stalowa Wola]], and attended church in nearby [[Wola Rzeczycka]], obtaining support from villagers in [[K<U+0119>pa Rzeczycka]]. They were sheltered temporarily by a Catholic family in [[Rzeczyca Okr<U+0105>g<U+0142>a]]. The young Jerzy even served as an [[altar boy]] in a local church.<ref>James Park Sloan.

After World War II, Kosi<U+0144>ski remained with his parents in Poland, moved to [[Jelenia G<U+00F3>ra]], and by the age of 22 had earned two [[Graduate degree#Poland|graduate degrees]] in history and sociology at the [[University of <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]].<ref name="Taylor"/> He worked as an associate professor at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]. Kosinski also studied in the [[Soviet Union]], and served as a [[sharpshooter]] in the [[Polish Army]].<ref name="Taylor"/> 

To emigrate to the United States in 1957, he created a fake foundation which supposedly sponsored him.<ref name=people1>{{cite news |first= Andrea|last= Chambers|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Because He Writes from Life<U+2014>his<U+2014>sex and Violence Haunt Jerzy Kosi<U+0144>ski's Fiction |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074595,00.html |publisher=People Weekly |accessdate=June 28, 2008 }}</ref>  He later claimed that he forged the letters from eminent Polish communist authorities guaranteeing his loyal return, which were needed for anyone leaving the country at that time.<ref name=people1 />  

After taking odd jobs to get by, such as driving a truck,<ref name=people1/> Kosi<U+0144>ski graduated from [[Columbia University]]. In 1965, he became an American citizen. He received grants from the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1967 and the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1968. in 1970, he received the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] award for literature.<ref>{{cite news |title=In Novels and Life, a Maverick and an Eccentric |author=Mervyn Rothstein |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 4, 1991 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/obituaries/in-novels-and-life-a-maverick-and-an-eccentric.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm}}</ref> The grants allowed him to write a political non-fiction book that opened new doors of opportunity.<ref name=people1/> He became a lecturer at [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Davenport University|Davenport]], and [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]] Universities.  

In 1962, Kosi<U+0144>ski married American steel heiress [[Mary Hayward Weir]]. They divorced in 1966. After Weir died in 1968 from [[brain cancer]], Kosi<U+0144>ski was left nothing in her [[Will (law)|will]]. He later fictionalized this marriage in his novel ''Blind Date'', speaking of Weir under pseudonym Mary-Jane Kirkland.<ref name=people1/> Kosi<U+0144>ski went on to marry Katherina "Kiki" von Fraunhofer, a marketing consultant and descendant of [[Bavaria]]n aristocracy.<ref name=people1/>

=== Death ===
Kosi<U+0144>ski suffered from multiple illnesses at the end of his life, and was under attack from journalists who accused him of plagiarism.<ref name=medscape/> By the time he reached his late 50s, he was suffering from an [[irregular heartbeat]] as well as severe physical and nervous exhaustion.

Kosi<U+0144>ski committed [[suicide]] on May 3, 1991, by  ingesting a lethal amount of alcohol and drugs,<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/barbiturates ''Los Angeles Times'']</ref> and wrapping a plastic bag around his head and suffocating to death.<ref name=obitnyt/><ref name="Taylor">Taylor, John.

== Novels ==
Kosi<U+0144>ski's novels have appeared on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], and have been translated into over 30 languages, with total sales estimated at 70 million in 1991.<ref name = "Greenwood">[http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/HJO%252f.aspx Greenwood Press advertisement]</ref>

=== ''The Painted Bird'' ===
''[[The Painted Bird]]'', Kosi<U+0144>ski's controversial 1965 novel, is a fictional account that depicts the personal experiences of a boy of unknown religious and ethnic background who wanders around unidentified areas of [[Eastern Europe]] during [[World War II]] and takes refuge among a series of people, many of whom are brutally cruel and abusive, either to him or to others. 

Soon after the book was published in the US, Kosi<U+0144>ski was accused by the [[People's Republic of Poland|then-Communist]] Polish government of being [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]], especially following the regime's [[March 1968 events|1968 anti-Semitic campaign]].<ref name="NYT">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DA1039F931A15757C0A96F948260 "Poland Publishes 'The Painted Bird'"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 22, 1989.</ref> The book was banned in Poland from its initial publication until the fall of the Communist government in 1989. When it was finally printed, thousands of Poles in Warsaw lined up for as long as eight hours to purchase copies of the work autographed by Kosi<U+0144>ski.<ref name="NYT"/> Polish literary critic and [[University of Warsaw]] professor [[Pawe<U+0142> Dudziak]] remarked that "in spite of the unclear role of its author,''The Painted Bird'' is an achievement in English literature." He stressed that since the book is a work of fiction and does not document real-world events, accusations of anti-Polish sentiment may result only from taking it too literally.<ref name="culture.pl">Dudziak, Pawe<U+0142>. [http://www.culture.pl/web/english/resources-film-full-page/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/jerzy-kosinski JERZY KOSI<U+0143>SKI], 2003.

The book received recommendations from [[Elie Wiesel]] who wrote in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' that it was "one of the best... Written with deep sincerity and sensitivity." [[Richard Kluger]], reviewing it for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' wrote:  "Extraordinary... literally staggering ... one of the most powerful books I have ever read." [[Jonathon Yardley]], reviewing it for ''[[The Miami Herald]]'', wrote: "Of all the remarkable fiction that emerged from World War II, nothing stands higher than Jerzy Kosi<U+0144>ski's ''The Painted Bird''. A magnificent work of art, and a celebration of the individual will. No one who reads it will forget it; no one who reads it will be unmoved by it."<ref name = "Barnes&Noble">[http://btobsearch.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?z=y&btob=&isbn=0-8021-3422-X#TABS From book promotional advertisement by Barnes & Noble]</ref>

However, reception of the book was not uniformly positive. After being translated into Polish, it was read by the people with whom the Lewinkopf family lived during the war. They recognized names of Jewish children sheltered by them (who also survived the war), depicted in the novel as victims of abuse by characters based on them.<ref name="PR-IP" /> Also, according to [[Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski]], ''The Painted Bird'' was Kosi<U+0144>ski's most successful attempt at [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]] from the Holocaust by maintaining an aura of a chronicle.<ref name="PR-IP">[[Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski]], [http://www.pogonowski.com/display.php?textid=410 On literary profiteers of the Holocaust]</ref> In addition, several claims that Kosi<U+0144>ski committed plagiarism in writing ''The Painted Bird'' were leveled against him. (See 'Criticism' section, below.)

=== ''Steps'' ===
''[[Steps (novel)|Steps]]'' (1968), a novel comprising scores of loosely connected vignettes, won the U.S. [[National Book Award for Fiction]].<ref name=nba1969/>

American novelist [[David Foster Wallace]] described ''Steps'' as a "collection of unbelievably creepy little allegorical tableaux done in a terse elegant voice that's like nothing else anywhere ever". Wallace continued in praise: "Only Kafka's fragments get anywhere close to where Kosi<U+0144>ski goes in this book, which is better than everything else he ever did combined."<ref>{{cite web|last=Zacharek |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.salon.com/books/bag/1999/04/12/wallace/ |title=Overlooked |publisher=Salon.com |date=April 12, 1999 |accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref> Samuel Coale, in a 1974 discussion of Kosi<U+0144>ski's fiction, wrote that "the narrator of  ''Steps'' for instance, seems to be nothing more than a disembodied voice howling in some surrealistic wilderness."<ref>Samuel Coale.

=== ''Being There'' ===
One of Kosi<U+0144>ski's most significant works is ''[[Being There (novel)|Being There]]'' (1971), a satiric look at the unreality of America's media culture. It is the story of Chance the gardener, a man without many defining qualities who emerges from nowhere and suddenly becomes the heir to the throne of a Wall Street tycoon and a presidential policy adviser. His simple and straightforward responses to popular concerns are praised as visionary despite no one really understanding what he is really saying. Many questions surround his mysterious origins, and filling in the blanks in his background proves impossible.  

The novel was made into a [[Being There|1979 movie]] directed by [[Hal Ashby]], starring [[Peter Sellers]], who was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for the role and [[Melvyn Douglas]], who won the award for Best Supporting Actor.  The [[screenplay]] was co-authored by award-winning [[screenwriter]] [[Robert C. Jones]] with Kosi<U+0144>ski. The film won the 1981 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (Film) Best Screenplay Award, as well as the 1980 [[Writers Guild of America Award]] (Screen) for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.  It was also nominated for the 1980 [[Golden Globes]] Best Screenplay Award (Motion Picture).<ref name = "imdb">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0467085/awards www.imdb.com/name/nm0467085/awards]</ref>

== Criticism ==
According to [[Eliot Weinberger]], an American writer, [[essayist]], [[editing|editor]] and [[Translation|translator]], Kosi<U+0144>ski was not the author of ''The Painted Bird''. Weinberger alleged in his 2000 book ''Karmic Traces'' that Kosi<U+0144>ski was not fluent in English at the time of its writing.<ref name = "Weinberger">Eliot Weinberger ''Genuine Fakes'' in his collection ''Karmic Traces''; New Directions, 2000, ISBN 0-8112-1456-7; ISBN 978-0-8112-1456-8</ref> 

In a review of ''Jerzy Kosi<U+0144>ski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan, D. G. Myers, Associate Professor of English at Texas A&M University wrote "For years Kosinski passed off ''The Painted Bird'' as the true story of his own experience during the Holocaust. Long before writing it he regaled friends and dinner parties with macabre tales of a childhood spent in hiding among the Polish peasantry. Among those who were fascinated was Dorothy de Santillana, a senior editor at [[Houghton Mifflin]], to whom Kosinski confided that he had a manuscript based on his experiences. Upon accepting the book for publication Santillana said, "It is my understanding that, fictional as the material may sound, it is straight autobiography." Although he backed away from this claim, Kosinski never wholly disavowed it."<ref name = "Myers">[http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html  D. G. Myers, ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan]</ref>

M. A. Orthofer addressed Weinberger's assertion by saying: 
"Kosinski was, in many respects, a fake <U+2013> possibly near as genuine a one as Weinberger could want. (One aspect of the best fakes is the lingering doubt that, possibly, there is some authenticity behind them <U+2013> as is the case with Kosinski.) Kosinski famously liked to pretend he was someone he wasn't (as do many of the characters in his books), he occasionally published under a pseudonym, and, apparently, he plagiarized and forged left and right."<ref name = "Orthofer">
[http://www.complete-review.com/quarterly/vol2/issue1/ffakes.htm "Facts and Fakes" by M.A.Orthofer]</ref>

Kosi<U+0144>ski himself addressed these claims in the introduction to the 1976 reissue of ''The Painted Bird'', saying that "Well-intentioned writers critics, and readers sought facts to back up their claims that the novel was autobiographical. They wanted to cast me in the role of spokesman for my generation, especially for those who had survived the war; but for me survival was an individual action that earned the survivor the right to speak only for himself. Facts about my life and my origins, I felt, should not be used to test the book's authenticity, any more than they should be used to encourage readers to read ''The Painted Bird''. Furthermore, I felt then, as I do now, that fiction and autobiography are very different modes."<ref>{{cite book|title=''The Painted Bird''|last=Kosinski|first=Jerry|pages=xiii<U+2013>xiv|year=1976|publisher=Grove Press Books|isbn=0-8021-3422-X|nopp=true}}</ref>

=== Plagiarism allegations ===
In June 1982, a ''[[Village Voice]]'' report by Geoffrey Stokes and Eliot Fremont-Smith accused Kosi<U+0144>ski of [[plagiarism]], claiming that much of his work was derivative of prewar books unfamiliar to English readers, and that ''Being There'' was a plagiarism of ''Kariera Nikodema Dyzmy'' <U+2014> ''[[The Career of Nicodemus Dyzma]]'' <U+2014> a 1932 Polish bestseller by [[Tadeusz Do<U+0142><U+0119>ga-Mostowicz]].  They also alleged Kosi<U+0144>ski wrote ''The Painted Bird'' in Polish, and had it secretly translated into English.  The report claimed that Kosi<U+0144>ski's books had actually been ghost-written by "assistant editors",  finding [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] differences among Kosi<U+0144>ski's novels. Kosi<U+0144>ski, according to them, had depended upon his free-lance editors for "the sort of composition that we usually call writing." American biographer [[James Park Sloan|James Sloan]] notes that New York poet, publisher and translator, [[George Reavey]], claimed to have written ''The Painted Bird'' for Kosi<U+0144>ski.<ref>[[George Reavey|Reavey]][http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9610/myers.html D. G. Myers, ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan]</ref> 

The article found a more realistic picture of Kosi<U+0144>ski's life during the Holocaust <U+2014> a view which was supported by biographers [[Joanna Siedlecka]] and Sloan.  The article asserted that ''The Painted Bird,'' assumed by some to be semi-[[autobiographical]], was largely a work of fiction.  The information showed that rather than wandering the Polish countryside, as his fictional character did, Kosi<U+0144>ski spent the war years in hiding with a [[Polish Catholic]] family.

[[Terence Blacker]], a profitable English [[publisher]] (who helped publish Kosi<U+0144>ski's books) and author of children's books and mysteries for adults, wrote in his article published in ''[[The Independent]]'' in 2002:  <blockquote>"The significant point about Jerzy Kosi<U+0144>ski was that ... his books ... had a vision and a voice consistent with one another and with the man himself. The problem was perhaps that he was a successful, worldly author who played polo, moved in fashionable circles and even appeared as an actor in Warren Beatty's ''Reds''.  He seemed to have had an adventurous and rather kinky sexuality which, to many, made him all the more suspect.  All in all, he was a perfect candidate for the snarling pack of literary hangers-on to turn on.  There is something about a storyteller becoming rich and having a reasonably full private life that has a powerful potential to irritate so that, when things go wrong, it causes a very special kind of joy."<ref name = "Blacker">

D.G. Myers responded to [[Terence Blacker|Blacker's]] assertions in his review of ''Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography'' by James Park Sloan: 
<blockquote>"This theory explains much: the reckless driving, the abuse of small dogs, the thirst for fame, the fabrication of personal experience, the secretiveness about how he wrote, the denial of his Jewish identity. 'There was a hollow space at the center of Kosinski that had resulted from denying his past,' Sloan writes, 'and his whole life had become a race to fill in that hollow space before it caused him to implode, collapsing inward upon himself like a burnt-out star.' On this theory, Kosinski emerges as a classic borderline personality, frantically defending himself against<U+2026> all-out psychosis.<ref name = "Myers" /></blockquote>

Journalist [[John Corry]], wrote a 6,000-word feature article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in November 1982, responding and defending Kosi<U+0144>ski, which appeared on the front page of the Arts and Leisure section.  Among other things, Corry alleged that reports claiming that "Kosinski was a [[plagiarist]] in the pay of the [[C.I.A.]] were the product of a Polish Communist [[disinformation]] campaign."<ref name = "Corry(2)">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30C1FFC3D5D0C748CDDA80994DA484D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fC%2fCorry%2c%20John select.nytimes.com]</ref>

Kosi<U+0144>ski himself responded that he had never maintained that the book was autobiographical, even though years earlier he confided to Houghton Mifflin editor Santillana that his manuscript "draws upon a childhood spent, by the casual chances of war, in the remotest villages of [[Eastern Europe]]."<ref name = "Myers" /> In 1988, he wrote ''The Hermit of 69th Street'', in which he sought to demonstrate the absurdity of investigating prior work by inserting footnotes for practically every term in the book.<ref name = "Komisar">[http://www.nytheatre-wire.com/lk01033t.htm#2 New York Theatre Wire: "More Lies About Jerzy" by Lucy Komisar]</ref> "Ironically," wrote theatre critic Lucy Komisar, "possibly his only true book... about a successful author who is shown to be a fraud."<ref name = "Komisar" />

Despite repudiation of the ''Village Voice'' allegations in detailed articles in ''The New York Times'', ''The Los Angeles Times'', and other publications, Kosi<U+0144>ski remained tainted. "I think it contributed to his death," said [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], a friend and fellow Polish exile.<ref name="Taylor"/>

== TV, radio, film, and newspaper appearances ==
Kosi<U+0144>ski appeared 12 times on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' during 1971<U+2013>73, and ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' in 1974, was a guest on the talk radio show of [[Long John Nebel]], posed half-naked for a cover photograph by [[Annie Leibovitz]] for ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 1982, and presented the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for screenwriting in 1982.

He also played the role of [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary and [[Politburo]] member [[Grigory Zinoviev]] in [[Warren Beatty]]'s film ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''.  The ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine critic wrote:  "As  Reed's Soviet nemesis, novelist Jerzy Kosinski acquits himself nicely<U+2013>a tundra of ice against Reed's all-American fire."  ''[[Newsweek]]'' complimented Kosinski's "delightfully abrasive" performance.

== Friendships ==
Kosi<U+0144>ski was friends with [[Roman Polanski]], with whom he attended the [[National Film School in <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], and said he narrowly missed being at Polanski and [[Sharon Tate]]'s house on the night Tate was murdered by [[Charles Manson]]'s followers in 1969, due to lost luggage.  His novel ''Blind Date'' discussed the Manson murders.<ref name=people1/>

Kosi<U+0144>ski was also friends with [[Wojciech Frykowski]] and [[Abigail Folger]]. He introduced the couple.

Kosi<U+0144>ski wrote his novel ''Pin Ball'' (1982) for his friend [[George Harrison]], having conceived of the idea for the book at least ten years before writing it.<ref>Kosi<U+0144>ski, Jerzy (1992) ''Passing By: Selected Essays, 1962-1991'' Grove Press, p.54 ISBN 0802134238</ref>

In 1984, Polanski denied Kosinski's story in his autobiography. Journalist John Taylor of [[New York Magazine]] believes Polanski was mistaken. "Although it was a single sentence in a 461-page book, reviewers focused on it. But the accusation was untrue: Jerzy and Kiki ''had'' been invited to stay with Tate the night of the Manson murders, and they missed being killed as well only because they stopped in New York en route from Paris because their luggage had been misdirected." The reason why Taylor believes this, is that "a friend of Kosinski's wrote a letter to the ''Times'', which was published in the ''Book Review'', describing the detailed plans he and Jerzy had made to meet that weekend at Polanski's house on Cielo Drive. Few people saw the letter." The NYM article does not contain the name of this friend, nor the particular issue of the ''Book Review'' in which this letter is supposed to have been published, nor names of the 'few' who may have read the letter.<ref name="Taylor"/>

== Interests ==
He practiced the photographic arts, with one-man exhibitions to his credit in [[Warsaw]]'s Crooked Circle Gallery (1957), and in the Andre Zarre Gallery in New York (1988). He watched surgeries, and read to terminally ill patients.<ref name=people1/>

Kosi<U+0144>ski was also very interested in [[polo]], and compared himself to a character from his novel ''Passion Play'': "The character, Fabian, is at the mercy of his aging and his sexual obsession. It's my calling card. I'm 46. I'm like Fabian."<ref name=people1/>
