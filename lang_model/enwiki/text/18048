'''No. 40 Wing''' formed part of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Palestine Brigade RAF|Palestine Brigade]] during [[World War I]] and immediately after. It was established in October 1917 as '''40th (Army) Wing''', [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), and become part of the RAF in April 1918, when the RFC merged with the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]. The wing played a major part in the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], the last great offensive against the [[Ottoman Empire]], in September 1918. It was disbanded in April 1920.

Augmented by a giant [[Handley Page Type O|Handley Page bomber]], No. 40 Wing took part in the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]], [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby's]] final offensive in Palestine, where its units inflicted "wholesale destruction" on [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] columns through sustained aerial assaults.<ref name="Stephens pp.13-14">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 13<U+2013>4.</ref><ref name="Mordike pp.33-36">Mordike, ''RAF  Air Power Review'', pp. 33<U+2013>6.</ref> At [[Wadi al-Far'a|Wadi Fara]] on 21 September 1918, the Palestine Brigade, including the 40th Wing's four squadrons, destroyed the bulk of the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)|Turkish Seventh Army]] as it attempted to cross the [[Jordan River]] along an old Roman road leading from [[Nablus]], an early demonstration of the effects of concentrated air attack on ground troops.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles'', pp. 160<U+2013>61.</ref>  Williams wrote: "The Turkish Seventh Army ceased to exist and it must be noted that this was entirely the result of attack from the air." A detachment from No. 1 Squadron also aided Major [[T. E. Lawrence]]'s Arab army north of [[Amman]] when it was harassed by German aircraft operating from [[Daraa|Deraa]].<ref>Odgers, ''100 Years of Australia at War'', pp. 84<U+2013>5.</ref>

While the wing's actions during the Battle of Megiddo "assured Allenby's victory" according to historian [[Lawrence James]], the new method of waging war by inflicting "sickening slaughter" from the air provoked a strong reaction from Lieutenant General [[Edward Bulfin]], commander of the British XXI Corps. He confronted Major General [[Geoffrey Salmond]], [[Air Officer Commanding]] RAF Middle East, with the comment, "You are a butcher<U+2014>you call that fighting?"<ref name="Mordike pp.33-36"/>

No. 40 Wing was based at RAF [[Isma<U+00EF>lia|Ismailia]] in Egypt from 1919, and disbanded on 1 April 1920.<ref name="Wing Nos 1 - 50"/>
