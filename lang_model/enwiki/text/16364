'''HMS ''Warrior''''' was the [[name ship]] of her [[Warrior-class ironclad|class]] of two [[armoured frigate]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in 1859<U+2013>61. She and her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|6}} were the first armour-plated, iron-hulled [[warship]]s; they were built in response to the first [[ironclad]] ocean-going warship, the wooden-hulled [[French ironclad Gloire|French ironclad ''Gloire'']], launched in 1859. Rapid advances in naval technology left ''Warrior'' and her sister obsolete within a short time, however, and she spent more time in reserve and training roles than in first-line service. 

''Warrior'' spent her active career with the [[Channel Fleet]] and was [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed in 1883. She served as a storeship and depot ship before she was assigned to Royal Navy's torpedo training school in 1904. The ship was converted into a floating oil [[jetty]] in 1927 and remained in that role until 1979 when restoration began. Listed as part of the [[National Historic Fleet, Core Collection|National Historic Fleet]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalhistoricships.org.uk/register/501/hms-warrior|title=HMS Warrior|publisher=National HIstoric Ships UK|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref> she is now a [[museum ship]] in [[Portsmouth, England]].

==Design and description==
The ''Warrior''-class ships have been described as revolutionary, but in truth they were more evolutionary than not as everything except their wrought iron armour had been in use by ocean-going ships for years.<ref name=b12/> The naval architect and historian David K. Brown commented, "What made [''Warrior''] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world."<ref name=b12>{{harvnb|Brown|2003|page=12}}</ref> They were designed in response to ''Gloire'', which started an invasion scare in Britain,<ref>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=6}}</ref> but they had a very different concept of operation to the French ship which was meant as a replacement for wooden [[ships of the line]]. They were designed by [[Director of Naval Construction|Chief Constructor of the Navy]] [[Isaac Watts (naval architect)|Isaac Watts]] as 40-gun armoured frigates largely based on the fine lines of the large frigate {{HMS|Mersey|1858|6}}. ''Warrior'' was not intended to stand in the [[line of battle]] as the [[Admiralty]] was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two and three-deck ships of the line. Rather they were designed to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought for their own advantage.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=18, 20<U+2013>21}}</ref>

HMS ''Warrior'' was {{convert|380|ft|2|in|m|1}} [[Length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and {{convert|420|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|58|ft|4|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|26|ft|9|in|m|1}}. The ship [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|9137|LT|t}} and had a [[tonnage]] of 6109 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]].<ref name=b1>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=241}}</ref> The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s into 92 compartments and had a [[double bottom]] underneath the [[engine room|engine]] and [[boiler room (ship)|boiler room]]s.<ref name=p18>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=18}}</ref>

===Propulsion===
The ''Warrior''-class ships had a single two-cylinder [[Trunk engine|trunk steam engine]] made by [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn and Sons]] driving a single {{convert|24|ft|6|in|m|1|adj=on}} propeller.<ref>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=246}}</ref> Ten rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s<ref>{{harvnb|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|page=7}}</ref> provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of {{convert|20|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engine produced a total of {{convert|5772|ihp|lk=in}} during ''Warrior''{{'}}s [[sea trial]]s on 1 April 1868 and the ship had a speed of {{convert|14.079|kn|lk=in}} under steam alone.<ref>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|pages=246<U+2013>47}}</ref> The ship carried {{convert|800|-|850|LT|t}} of coal, enough to steam {{convert|2100|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|11|knots}}.<ref name=p01>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|pages=20<U+2013>21}}</ref>

The ironclads were [[ship rig]]ged and had a sail area of {{convert|48400|sqft|sqm|0}}. ''Warrior'' reached {{convert|13|kn}} under sail, {{convert|2|kn}} faster than her [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Black Prince|1861|2}}. Her propeller was designed to be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail; the largest hoisting propeller ever made, it required 600 men to raise it into the stern.<ref name=p01/> To further reduce drag, her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] was telescopic and could be lowered.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=108}}</ref>

===Armament===
[[File:RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun HMS Warrior left side.jpg|thumb|Right| One of the replica 110-pdr breech-loaders on the restored ''Warrior'']]
The armament of the ''Warrior''-class ships was intended to be 40 [[British ordnance terms#SBML|smoothbore, muzzle-loading]] [[68-pounder gun]]s, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as [[chase gun]]s on the upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten [[RBL 7 inch Armstrong gun|Armstrong 7-inch, 110-pounder]] rifled [[breechloader|breech-loading guns]] (RBL), twenty-six 68-pounders, and four RBL [[RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun|Armstrong 40-pounder guns]]. It had been planned to replace all the 68-pounders with the 7-inch Armstrong guns, but poor results in testing brought a halt to this plan.<ref name=Lambert82 >{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=82}}</ref>

The {{convert|7.9|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} [[roundshot|solid shot]] of the 68-pounder gun weighed approximately {{convert|68|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|10640|lb|kg|1}}. The gun had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1579|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and had a range of {{convert|3200|yd}} at an elevation of 12<U+00B0>. The {{convert|7|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} shell of the 110-pounder Armstrong breech-loader weighed {{convert|107|-|110|lb|1}}. It had a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1150|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and, at an elevation of 11.25<U+00B0>, a maximum range of {{convert|4000|yd}}. The shell of the 40-pounder breech-loading gun was {{convert|4.75|in|0}} in diameter and weighed {{convert|40|lbs|1}}. The gun had a maximum range of {{convert|3800|yd}}. All of the guns could fire both solid shot and [[Shell (projectile)|explosive shells]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=85<U+2013>87, 89}}</ref>

The ship also carried two [[RBL 20 pounder Armstrong gun|RBL Armstrong 20-pounders]] and one [[RBL 12 pounder 8 cwt Armstrong gun|RBL Armstrong 12-pounder]], largely intended for use in the ship's boats or for use as field guns, although they were mounted for use on board. Finally, a 6-pounder brass cannon was carried for practice use.<ref name=Lambert85 >{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=85}}</ref>

The 40-pounder Armstrong guns were replaced with a better design of the same calibre in 1863.<ref name=Lambert85 /> ''Warrior''{{'}}s original armament was replaced during her 1867<U+2013>68 refit with twenty-four 7-inch and four {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} [[Muzzle-loading rifle|rifled muzzle-loading guns]]. The ship also received four [[RBL 20 pounder Armstrong gun|20-pounder]] breech-loading guns for use as saluting guns.<ref name=p19>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=19}}</ref> The shell of the 15-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[RML 8 inch 9 ton gun|8-inch gun]] weighed {{convert|175|lb|kg|1}} while the gun itself weighed {{convert|9|LT|t}}. It had a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|1410|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal {{convert|9.6|in|mm|0}} of [[wrought iron]] armour at the [[muzzle (firearms)|muzzle]]. The 16-calibre [[RML 7 inch 6.5 ton gun|7-inch gun]] weighed {{convert|6.5|LT|t}} and fired a {{convert|112|lb|kg|1|adj=on}} shell. It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate {{convert|7.7|in|mm|adj=on|0}} armour.<ref>{{harvnb|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|page=6}}</ref>

===Armour===
[[File:HMS Warrior(1860)bulkheadarmour.JPG|thumb|right|Cross section of ''Warrior''{{'}}s bulkhead armour. Iron on the right backed by teak.]]
''Warrior''{{'}}s armour consisted {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} of iron backed by {{convert|18|in|mm|0}} of [[teak]]. The iron armour was made up of plates 3 feet by 12 feet that interlocked via the [[tongue and groove]] method. It was bolted through the teak to the iron hull. The teak consisted of two {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick|0}} layers laid at right angles to each other. The teak served to strengthen the armour by damping the shock waves caused by the impact of shells that would otherwise serve to break the bolts that connected the armour to the hull.<ref name=Lambert69 >{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=67, 69}}</ref> Based on tests at [[Shoeburyness]] in October of 1861 when the ''Warrior'' was launched, it "was practically invulnerable to the ordnance  at the time in use".<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton & Company|location=New York|page=621|url=http://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n627/mode/1up}}</ref>

The armour covered the middle {{convert|213|ft|1}} of the ship and extended {{convert|16|ft|1}} above the [[waterline]] and {{convert|6|ft|1}} below it. 4.5-inch transverse bulkheads protected the guns on the main deck from [[raking fire]]. The ends of the ship were left entirely unprotected which meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable.<ref name=p19/> Another weakness was that the armour became more brittle at lower temperatures and thus less resistant to impacts.<ref name=Lambert70 >{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=70<U+2013>71}}</ref>

==Service career==
''Warrior'' was ordered on 11 May 1859<ref name=b0>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=240}}</ref> from [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Co.]] in [[Blackwall, London]]. The ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on 25 May 1859, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 December 1860 and completed on 24 October 1861<ref name=b0/> for the price of <U+00A3>377,292.<ref>{{harvnb|Parkes|1990|page=16}}</ref> She was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] earlier, in August, to conduct her sea trials.<ref name=b0/> Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage received during the trials repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter [[bowsprit]] and a shorter [[jib boom]], along with the provision of extra [[Head (watercraft)|heads]] amidships.<ref name=wells111>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=111}}</ref> 

The ship was assigned to the Channel Squadron under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Arthur Cochrane (Royal Navy officer)|Arthur Cochrane]]. In March 1863, ''Warrior'' escorted the [[royal yacht]] bringing Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]] to Britain to marry the [[Prince of Wales]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=55}}</ref> In mid-1863 the Channel Fleet toured the ports of Great Britain where the ship was the centre of attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=36}}</ref>

[[File:HMS Warrior 1872.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of ''Warrior'' under sail]]
''Warrior'' then began a refit in November 1864. She was briefly commissioned with the intention of becoming [[guardship]] at [[Queenstown, Ireland]] and with this crew appeared in the 1867 [[Fleet Review]]. This commission was cancelled after 24 days, and on 25 July 1867 she was again recommissioned under Captain Henry Boys. After working up at [[Spithead]], she sailed to join the Channel Squadron on 24 September. In 1865 she was deployed to [[Osborne Bay]] to guard [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Osborne House]]. This was not merely an honorary guard, since this was the year of the [[Fenian Rising]], and there was intelligence that suggested that the Queen might be in danger from Irish nationalists. At some point during the time ''Warrior'' was performing this duty the ship received an informal visit from Queen Victoria. In April 1868 she was part of a squadron that escorted the royal yacht {{ship|HMY|Victoria and Albert II}} to [[Dublin]] for an official visit by the then [[Prince of Wales]], the future [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. In August the squadron departed for a cruise to Scotland. During the cruise, ''Warrior'' collided with {{HMS|Royal Oak|1862|6}}, losing her figurehead and jib boom and seriously damaging ''Royal Oak''{{'}}s [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=138<U+2013>43}}</ref>

From 4 to 28 July, ''Warrior'', together with ''Black Prince'' and the wooden paddle frigate {{HMS|Terrible|1845|6}}, was employed to tow the specially built 'Bermuda' floating [[dry dock]] across the Atlantic from [[Madeira]] to [[Ireland Island]], [[Bermuda]]. After a time in dry dock to have her bottom cleaned and the figurehead lost in the collision with ''Royal Oak'' replaced, ''Warrior'' rejoined the Channel Squadron. While returning from a joint cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet, the ship was present when {{HMS|Captain|1869|6}} was lost during a severe storm on 7 September 1870. Further cruises followed, including trips to [[Madeira]] and Gibraltar.<ref>{{harvnb|Wells|1987|pages=144<U+2013>54}}</ref> While departing Gibraltar, ''Warrior'' was following {{HMS|Agincourt|1865|6}} when the latter ship [[Ship grounding|grounded]] on Pearl Rock and narrowly missed colliding with her.<ref>{{harvnb|Ballard|1980|page=56}}</ref>

In September 1871, ''Warrior'' began a refit that lasted until 1875. The work carried out included the addition of a [[poop deck]], a steam [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]], a shorter bowsprit and the replacement of her boilers.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=38<U+2013>39}}</ref> In April 1875, the ship was recommissioned, now having been relegated to the First Reserve where she served as a guardship at [[Portland Harbour|Portland]].<ref name=brown84 >{{harvnb|Brown|2009|page=84}}</ref> During this time, she went on yearly summer cruises to various ports. In 1878 she was mobilised in reaction to concern that Russia might be about to attack [[Constantinople]], but the attack did not materialise, and ''Warrior'' cruised to [[Bantry Bay]]. In April 1881 she was transferred to the [[Clyde District]], where she served as guardship until 31 May 1883.<ref name=Lambert40>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=40<U+2013>41}}</ref>

''Warrior'' was then used as a storage [[Hulk (ship)|hulk]], and from 1902 to 1904, as a depot ship for a flotilla of [[destroyer]]s. Her name was changed to HMS ''Vernon III'' in March 1904, a month after she joined Portsmouth-based {{HMS|Vernon|shore establishment|2}}, the Royal Navy's torpedo training school. Her role was supplying [[steam]] and electricity to the neighbouring hulks that made up ''Vernon''. In October 1923, the school was transferred to a newly built shore installation, rendering ''Warrior'' and her companion hulks redundant; the Royal Navy put her up for sale in 1924.<ref name=brown85 >{{harvnb|Brown|2009|page=85}}</ref>

[[Image:HMS Warrior between decks.jpg|thumb|left|Warrior between decks after restoration]]
The mass scrapping of obsolete ships after [[World War I]] caused a downturn in demand for scrap iron when the Navy decided to sell her off. There was no commercial interest in the old ship, and she remained at Portsmouth for another five years, although she was modified into a mooring jetty in 1927. The hulk was towed for her new home, [[Pembroke Dock]], Wales, in March 1929. Upon arrival, she served as a floating oil jetty known from 1942 as ''Oil Fuel Hulk C77''. For the next fifty years, the ship lay just offshore from an oil depot at Llanion Cove, occasionally being towed to a nearby dry dock for maintenance work and additionally serving as a base ship for coastal [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s in [[World War II]].<ref name=l4>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=44}}</ref> She refuelled some 5,000 ships during her service at Llanion Cove.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/obsolescence|title=Obsolescence - Llanion Cove|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>

==Restoration==
[[File:Captian's day cabin HMS warior.JPG|thumb|right|The reproduced captain's day cabin]]
''Warrior'' was saved from being scrapped by the efforts of the [[Maritime Trust]]. As the world's first iron-hulled armoured warship, she was recognised as one of the Royal Navy's most historically important warships. In 1968 the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] chaired a meeting regarding the possibility of rescuing and restoring ''Warrior'', and a year later the Maritime Trust was established with a view to saving the decrepit ironclad and other historic ships. Throughout the 1970s the Maritime Trust carried out negotiations and feasibility studies regarding ''Warrior'', and finally obtained control of the ship in August 1979.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|pages=45<U+2013>47}}</ref>

Restoration of ''Warrior'' for use as a [[museum ship]] began in August 1979, when she began her {{convert|800|mi|adj=on}} journey to her temporary home in the Coal Dock at [[Hartlepool]], where the <U+00A3>8 million restoration project would be carried out, largely funded by the [[Manifold Trust]]. The ship arrived in Hartlepool on 2 September 1979.<ref>{{harvnb|Lambert|1987|page=47}}</ref> Over the next eight years, ''Warrior''{{'}}s decks, interior compartments, engines, woodwork and fittings were restored or recreated, her masts, rigging and funnels were recreated, and a new figurehead carved from photographs of the original (destroyed in the 1960s) as a guide. She arrived at her current berth in [[Portsmouth]] on 16 June 1987<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hmswarrior.org/history/homecoming|title=Restoration - Homecoming|publisher=HMS Warrior Preservation Trust|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref> and is now a part of the [[Portsmouth Historic Dockyard]] complex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicdockyard.co.uk/hmswarrior/|title=HMS Warrior 1860|publisher=Portsmouth Historic Dockyard|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref>

The restored ironclad was renamed HMS ''Warrior (1860)'' to avoid confusion with the [[Northwood Headquarters]], commissioned as HMS ''Warrior'', which was at the time the operational headquarters of the Royal Navy. In 1995 she received just over 280,000 visitors.<ref name=pccstats >{{Citation
