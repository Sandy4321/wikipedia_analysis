The song was later included on the band's first full-length album, ''[[Introducing the Beau Brummels]]'', released in April 1965. 

The Beau Brummels promoted the single by appearing on several television shows, including a 1965 episode of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in which the band gave an animated performance as the Beau Brummelstones. In 1994, "Laugh, Laugh" was selected to [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]] exhibit. Lead singer [[Sal Valentino]] reworked the song for his 2008 solo album, ''Every Now and Then.''

==Background and composition==
In 1964, San Francisco [[disc jockey]]s [[Tom Donahue]] and Bobby Mitchell were looking for new acts to bring to their [[Autumn Records (1960s)|Autumn Records]] label.<ref name="sfweekly">

They discovered the Beau Brummels performing at the Morocco Room, a club in nearby [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], and signed the band shortly thereafter.<ref name="sfweekly" /> 
Donahue and Mitchell were eager to capitalize on [[Beatlemania]], a phenomenon surrounding [[The Beatles]] that originated the previous year in the UK and was spreading across the U.S. by this time.<ref name="sfweekly" /> 
The Beau Brummels had taken their name from a term used to decribe a [[fop]], an excessively well-dressed person. The group liked that the name sounded British, and knew that following the Beatles so closely in the alphabet would likely result in the bands' records being placed next to each other on record store shelves.<ref>

Elliott grew up writing music inspired by theatrical composers such as [[George Gershwin]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as [[country music]] artist [[Lefty Frizzell]].<ref name="urban" /> 
After forming the Beau Brummels with [[lead vocalist]] Sal Valentino, Elliott wanted to create simplified music that had [[Mainstream#In_music|mainstream]] appeal.<ref name="urban" /> He noted that "Laugh, Laugh" had a "very complex chord structure, but instead of using the major seventh chords and the passing chords that I prefer, I wrote the song in flat major and minor keys using a simplified tonal structure."<ref name="echoes">

Elliott said he liked using minor keys as he believed they added an element of mystery to the music, similar to that of [[James Bond film series|James Bond films]].<ref name="urban" /> 
Lyrically, "Laugh, Laugh" describes a rejected lover who takes pleasure in revenge when someone rejects the one who had rejected him.<ref name="ruhlmann">

which included such bands as [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Grateful Dead]], [[We Five]], [[Moby Grape]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] and [[Country Joe and the Fish]].<ref name="echoes" /> The song has also been credited as one of the earliest tracks to blend [[beat music]] with [[folk rock]], even before [[The Byrds]] recorded "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]."<ref name="sfweekly" /><ref name="garage" /> 
[[Chris Hillman]], who played [[bass guitar]] with the Byrds, saw the Beau Brummels at a Los Angeles concert, and later remarked: "I remember them doing the hit they had, 'Laugh, Laugh.' They really sort of answered the Beatles before we did, in that sense."<ref name="byrds" /> 
However, Byrds singer-guitarist [[Roger McGuinn]] claimed "they had a little trouble singing in tune."<ref name="byrds" />

The song has remained generally well regarded by [[music critic]]s. It was chosen by [[Dave Marsh]] for his 1989 book, ''The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made''.<ref>
