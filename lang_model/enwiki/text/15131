The '''Australian swellshark''' or '''draughtboard shark''', ''Cephaloscyllium laticeps'', is a [[species]] of [[catshark]], [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scyliorhinidae]], [[endemic]] to southern [[Australia]]. This [[benthic|bottom-dwelling]] species can be found on the [[continental shelf]] down to a depth of {{convert|220|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Usually measuring {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, it is a stout-bodied, broad-headed shark with a short tail and a first [[dorsal fin]] much larger than the second. It can be identified by its variegated dorsal coloration of brown or gray patches and numerous spots.

Australian swellsharks are sedentary and mainly [[nocturnal]], with most individuals remaining within the same local area throughout the year. It feeds on small [[crustacean]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, and [[fish]]es. When threatened, it responds by rapidly taking in water or air to inflate its body, hence the name "swellshark". This shark is [[oviparous]] and females lay pairs of distinctively ridged [[mermaid's purse|egg capsules]] at 20&ndash;30 day intervals. The eggs hatch after 11&ndash;12 months. Harmless and of little [[commercial fishing|commercial interest]], many Australian swellsharks are [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] in [[gillnet]]s and [[bottom trawl]]s but usually survive to be released because of their extreme hardiness. As a result, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has assessed this species as of [[Least Concern]].

==Taxonomy==
The first scientific description of the Australian swellshark, as ''Scyllium laticeps'', was published in 1853 by French [[zoologist]] [[Auguste Dum<U+00E9>ril]], in the [[scientific journal]] ''Revue et Magasin de Zoologie''. The [[type specimen]] was a {{convert|79|cm|in|abbr=on}} long male caught off [[Tasmania]].<ref name="compagno"/> The [[specific epithet]] ''laticeps'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''latus'', meaning "broad", with the suffix ''ceps'', meaning "head".<ref name="bester">Bester, C.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australian swellshark inhabits the continental shelf of southern Australia, from the [[Recherche Archipelago]] off [[Western Australia]] to [[Jervis Bay]] in [[New South Wales]], including Tasmania.<ref name="iucn"/> It is commonly found on or near the bottom amongst rocky [[reef]]s or [[seaweed]] beds, from close to shore to a depth of {{convert|220|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="compagno">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |date=1984 |title=Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date |place=Rome |publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization |isbn=9251013845 |pages=299&ndash;300}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Coastal Fishes of South-eastern Australia |author=Kuiter, R.H. |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |date=1993 |isbn=0824815238 |page=9}}</ref>

==Description==
The Australian swellshark has a stocky, rounded body that tapers significantly to the short [[caudal peduncle]]. The head comprises no more than a fifth of the total length and is broad and moderately flattened, with a very short, thick, blunt snout. The [[nostril]]s are divided into small incurrent and excurrent openings by short, triangular flaps of skin that do not reach the mouth. The mouth is extremely large, without furrows at the corners. The teeth are numerous and small with multiple cusps; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The large, oval eyes are placed somewhat on the upper surface of the head, and have rudimentary [[nictitating membrane]]s (protective third [[eyelid]]s) and ridges underneath.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="bester"/>

There are two [[dorsal fin]]s, the first much larger than the second. The first dorsal originates over the forward half of the [[pelvic fin]] bases, while the second is located over the [[anal fin]]. The [[pectoral fin]]s are large and broad, and the anal fin is larger than the second dorsal fin. The short and broad [[caudal fin]] has an indistinct lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is thick and covered by well-[[calcification|calcified]], [[arrowhead]]-shaped [[dermal denticle]]s, which are more sparse in young sharks.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="bester"/> The back and sides are light gray to brown, with an irregular pattern of close-set darker saddles and blotches along with many dark (sometimes light) spots, and a dark stripe from under the eye to the pectoral fin origins. The fins do not have sharply lighter margins. The underside is cream-colored, with some mottling on the fins and often a dark stripe running down the middle in adults.<ref name="compagno et al">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V., M.

==Biology and ecology==
[[Image:Cephaloscyllium laticeps 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|alt=View from above of a wide-bodied shark with broad pectoral fins, appearing light gray against a background of dark green seaweed|An Australian swellshark off Tasmania; this species is very common within its range.]]
The most abundant catshark species in the coastal waters of southern Australia, the Australian swellshark is a generally sluggish swimmer that is more active at night. During the day, it is often found resting singly or in groups under ledges or inside caves. Tracking studies have shown that some individuals are continuously active for months at a time, while others alternate activity with periods of stationary rest lasting up to five days. Most Australian swellsharks present within a given region tend to remain there year-round, frequenting established feeding areas or preferred habitats. On the other hand, a minority of sharks have been recorded covering distances of up to {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="marsh"/><ref name="awruch"/> This extremely hardy species can survive for more than a day out of water.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Fishes of Australia, Part 1 |author=Whitley, G.P. |publisher=Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales |date=1940 |page=92}}</ref>

One of the higher-level [[predator]]s within its [[ecosystem]], the Australian swellshark feeds on [[crustacean]]s (particularly [[crab]]s and [[rock lobster]]s), [[cephalopod]]s (including [[squid]] and [[octopus]]), and small [[fish]]es. Even large-sized prey tends to be swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to [[digestion]].<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="awruch"/> Like the other members of its genus, this shark is capable of rapidly inflating its body by taking water or air into its [[stomach]], as a defense against [[predator]]s. These include larger fishes, such as the [[broadnose sevengill shark]] (''Notorynchus cepedianus''), and [[marine mammal]]s. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator.<ref name="marsh"/> [[gastropod|Marine snail]]s are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of [[parasite]] species, but these are poorly documented.<ref name="bester"/>

===Life history===
The Australian swellshark is [[oviparous]]. Males have larger teeth than females, with which to bite and hold onto them for [[copulation]].<ref name="marsh"/> Whether there is a specific [[mating season]] is uncertain, though in terms of [[sperm]] production males are capable of breeding year-round. Females have a single functional [[ovary]] and two [[oviduct]]s, [[ovulation|ovulating]] a single egg into each at a time. They can store sperm for at least 15 months. Females produce eggs throughout the year, laying them in pairs approximately once every 20 days from January to June, and once every 30 days the rest of the year. The second egg in a pair is deposited 12&ndash;24 hours after the first.<ref name="marsh"/><ref name="awruch"/>

The pale, flask-shaped [[mermaid's purse|egg capsule]]s measure {{convert|13|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} across, and bear 19&ndash;27 crosswise ridges. There are long, curling tendrils at the four corners, which allow the female to attach the capsule to seaweed or other bottom structures.<ref name="bester"/> In captivity, the [[embryo]] develops external gills at two months old, which are retained until it is five months old, at which time the internal gills take over and the first [[pigment]]ation appears. At six months, embryonic growth accelerates and the [[yolk sac]] begins to shrink, disappearing by nine to ten months of age. Hatching usually occurs at eleven to twelve months; the newly emerged young are miniature versions of the adults measuring {{convert|14|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="marsh">Marsh, N. (August 15, 2007). [http://www.nigelmarshphotography.com/articles/dboard.htm "A Swell Little Aussie Shark"]. ''Shark Diver Magazine'' '''15'''. Retrieved on September 7, 2009.</ref><ref name="awruch"/> Males [[sexual maturation|mature sexually]] at a length of {{convert|71|-|87|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, and females at {{convert|75|-|86|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="awruch"/>

==Human interactions==
The Australian swellshark is harmless to humans and seldom utilized, though recently in parts of Tasmania some have begun to be marketed as a source of "[[flake (fish)|flake]]".<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="awruch">Awruch, C.A. (2007). "The reproductive biology and movement patterns of the draughtboard shark, (''Cephaloscyllium laticeps''): implications for bycatch management". Ph.D. thesis, University of Tasmania, Australia.</ref> It is regarded as a nuisance by [[lobster]] fishers due to its habit of entering [[lobster trap|traps]] to eat the contents.<ref name="bester"/> Every year, substantial numbers of Australian swellsharks are caught as [[bycatch]] in the southeast Australian shark [[gillnet]] fishery, and more in [[bottom trawl]]s and on [[longline fishing|longlines]].<ref name="awruch"/> These animals are usually released, and likely suffer minimal mortality due to their resilience. Since this species at present faces little risk from fisheries, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has listed it as of [[Least Concern]]. Although [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] reported drops in Australian swellshark catches from 1973 to 1976 and 1998 to 2001, these appeared to have resulted from changing fishing habits rather than actual population declines.<ref name="iucn"/> Nevertheless, as a precaution the government of Tasmania has instituted a possession limit of two sharks per person or five sharks per boat per day.<ref name="awruch"/>
