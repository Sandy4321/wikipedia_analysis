'''SMS ''Schlesien''''' was one of the five [[Deutschland class battleship|''Deutschland'' class]] of [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built for the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] between 1904 and 1906.  Named after the German province of [[Schlesien]], she was built at the [[Schichau-Werke]] shipyard in [[Danzig]], where she was launched on 28 May 1906. She was commissioned into the navy on 5 May 1908. The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered service, being inferior in size, armor, fire power and speed to the new post-{{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}} battleships. 

After commissioning, ''Schlesien'' was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the [[High Seas Fleet]]. She served with the fleet throughout the first two years of [[World War I]]; by this time she had been transferred to the II Battle Squadron alongside her four [[sister ship]]s. ''Schlesien'' was present at the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May &ndash; 1 June 1916, where she was actively engaged only briefly. After Jutland, she was relegated to guard duties before being withdrawn altogether in 1917, when she became a training ship.

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] permitted the German navy to retain eight obsolete battleships, which included ''Schlesien'', to defend the German coast. She saw extensive service with the reorganized [[Reichsmarine]]; in the 1920s and 30s the ship was rebuilt and eventually converted back into a training ship. ''Schlesien'' saw limited combat during [[World War II]], including the [[invasion of Norway]] in 1940. Afterward the ship was again given secondary duties. She ended her career as an anti-aircraft ship in the Baltic; in April 1945 ''Schlesien'' was steaming to [[Swinem<U+00FC>nde]] to restock her ammunition and evacuate wounded soldiers when she struck a mine. She sank in shallow water, though much of her superstructure, including her main battery, remained above water. In the remaining months of the war, ''Schlesien'' used her heavy artillery to provide support for retreating German ground troops.

==Construction==
{{main|Deutschland class battleship}}

''Schlesien'' was intended to fight in the [[line of battle]] with the other battleships of the [[High Seas Fleet]].<ref>Herwig, p. 45</ref> She was laid down on 19 November 1904 at the [[AG Vulcan]] dockyard in [[Stettin]].<ref name=S5>Staff, p. 5</ref> She was launched on 28 May 1906; in March 1908 was sent to [[Kiel]] where her fitting out work was completed. She was commissioned for trials on 5 May, though her trials were interrupted from 6 July to 5 September when the ship was temporarily used as a torpedo trials vessel. ''Schlesien'' joined the fleet after the torpedo trials were completed in September.<ref name=S12>Staff, p. 12</ref> However, the British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}&mdash;armed with ten 12&nbsp;inch (30.5&nbsp;cm) guns&mdash;had already been commissioned nearly two years prior, in December  1906.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, pp. 21&ndash;22</ref> ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s revolutionary design rendered obsolete every ship of the German navy, including the newer ''Schlesien''.<ref>Herwig, p. 57</ref>

''Schlesien'' was {{convert|127.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, had a beam of {{convert|22.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a draft of {{convert|8.21|m|ft|abbr=on}}. She had a full-load displacement of {{convert|14218|t|sp=us}}. She was equipped with [[triple expansion engine]]s that produced a rated {{convert|16000|ihp}} and a top speed of {{convert|18|kn|abbr=on}}. In addition to being the fastest ship of her class, ''Schlesien'' was the most fuel efficient. At a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}, she could steam for {{convert|5830|nmi|sp=us}}.<ref name=S5/>

The ship's primary armament consisted of four [[28 cm SK L/40 gun|{{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/40]] guns in two twin turrets.<ref group=Note>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (Schnelladekanone) denotes that the gun is quick loading, while the L/40 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/40 gun is 40 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 40 times long as it is in diameter.</ref> She was also equipped with fourteen {{convert|17|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns mounted in casemates and twenty {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns in pivot mounts. The ship was also armed with six {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes, all submerged in the hull.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 20&ndash;21</ref>

==Service history==

After commissioning, ''Schlesien'' was assigned to the I Battle Squadron. Her first year of service, 1909, saw a pattern of fleet maneuvers in the North and Baltic Seas as well as the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=S14/> Her first cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August. Another round of exercises followed in the autumn.<ref name=S8>Staff, p. 8</ref> The I Battle Squadron was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven in April 1910.<ref name=S14/> The following month, in May 1910, the fleet conducted training maneuvers in the [[Kattegat]], between Norway and Denmark. For the first time, the annual summer cruise went to Norway. Fleet training followed in the fall. A training cruise into the Baltic followed at the end of the year.<ref name=S8/>

On 3 November 1911, ''Schlesien'' was transferred to the II Battle Squadron with the rest of her sister ships.<ref name=S14/> As with 1910, 1911 and 1912 followed the same pattern of training exercises and cruises to Norway in the summer, with the exception of the summer cruise in 1912. Due to the [[Agadir Crisis]] that year, the cruise only went into the Baltic.<ref name=S8/>

===World War I===
''Schlesien'' remained with the High Seas Fleet throughout the first two years of the naval war. At the outbreak of war, the ship was deployed to the [[German Bight]] to guard the area. She then rejoined the High Seas Fleet as part of the battleship support for the battlecruisers that [[Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby]] on 15&ndash;16 December 1914.<ref name=S14/> During the operation, the German battle fleet of some 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts came to within {{convert|10|nmi|abbr=on}} of a isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival [[destroyer]] screens convinced Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]] that he was confronted with the entire [[Grand Fleet]], and so he broke off the engagement and turned for home.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 31&ndash;33</ref> Two resultless fleet advances followed in April 1915, on 17&ndash;18 and 21&ndash;23 of the month. Another followed on 17&ndash;18 May, and another on 23&ndash;24 October.<ref name=S14>Staff, p. 14</ref>

On 24&ndash;25 April 1916,  ''Schlesien'' and her sisters joined the dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet to support the battlecruisers of the [[I Scouting Group]] on a raid of the English coast.<ref name=S14/> While en route to the target, the battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}} was damaged by a [[naval mine|mine]]. The battlecruisers conducted a short [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|bombardment of the ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft]]. Visibility was poor, so the operation was soon called off before the British fleet could intervene.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 52&ndash;54</ref>

====Battle of Jutland====
Admiral Scheer immediately planned another foray into the North Sea, but the damage to ''Seydlitz'' delayed the operation until the end of May.<ref>Tarrant, p. 58</ref> ''Schlesien'' was the second ship in the IV Division of the II Battle Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral [[Franz Mauve]], positioned at the rear of the German line. ''Schlesien'' was the second to last ship in the German [[line of battle|line]], followed only by ''Schleswig-Holstein''.<ref>Tarrant, p. 286</ref> During the "Run to the North," Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], the commander of the fleet, ordered the fleet to pursue the British V Battle Squadron at top speed. The slower ''Deutschland'' class ships could not keep up with the faster dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind.<ref>London, p. 73</ref>

Later on the first day of the battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. ''Schlesien'' and the other so-called "five-minute ships" came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons.<ref>Tarrant, p. 195</ref> ''Schlesien'' could barely make out a target in the darkness, as could several of her sisters. Due to the poor visibility their shooting was ineffective.<ref>London, pp. 70&ndash;71</ref> The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships; in the brief melee a near miss from a large-caliber gun sprayed shell splinters onto ''Schlesien''{{'}}s decks; one man was killed and another wounded.<ref name=S14/> Admiral Mauve ordered an 8-point turn to the south, and the British did not follow.<ref>London, p. 71</ref>

Late on the 31st, the fleet organized for the night march back to Germany; ''Schlesien'' and ''Schleswig-Holstein'' fell in behind the mauled battlecruisers {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} and {{SMS|Derfflinger}} at the rear of the line.<ref>Tarrant, p. 240</ref> British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet, some of which targeted ''Schlesien''.<ref name=S14/> Regardless, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached [[Horns Reef]] by 4:00 on 1 June.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 246&ndash;7</ref> The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the {{sclass|Nassau|battleship|5}} and {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|4}}es took up defensive positions.<ref>Tarrant, p. 263</ref>

===Inter-war years===
[[File:Schlesien Panama 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Schlesien'' in the Panama Canal in 1937]]
Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy, reorganized as the [[Reichsmarine]], was permitted to retain three of the ''Deutschland'' class battleships: ''Hannover'', ''Schleswig-Holstein'' and ''Schlesien'', along with several of the ''Braunschweig'' class battleships.<ref>Williamson ''Battleships'', pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref> ''Deutschland'', the oldest and least advanced ship of the class, was instead scrapped in 1922.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 22</ref> ''Schlesien'' and ''Schleswig-Holstein'' were modernized in the 1920s,<ref name=W6>Williamson ''Battleships'', p. 6</ref> which included the replacement of the ships' 17&nbsp;cm guns with {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} pieces.<ref>''Proceedings'', p. 1014</ref> ''Schlesien'' and ''Schleswig-Holstein'' continued in their battleship configuration with the active fleet, while ''Hannover'' was intended to be rebuilt as a target ship, although this never occurred.<ref name=C141>Gardiner & Gray, p. 141</ref>

''Schleswig-Holstein'' was the flagship of the fleet until 1932 when she was taken in for another reconstruction that converted the ship into a training vessel.<ref name=C222>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 222</ref> As a result, ''Schlesien'' held the position of fleet flagship afterward.<ref>Mueller, p. 89</ref> In 1932, [[Wilhelm Canaris]] took command of the ship, a post he held for two years.<ref>Kahn, p. 229</ref><ref group=Note>Canaris would subsequently be appointed chief of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' and use his position to support the [[German resistance]] during World War II. See Kahn, pp. 229&ndash;235</ref> In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the [[Kriegsmarine]].<ref name=W6/> Shortly thereafter, ''Schlesien'' took part in extensive fleet maneuvers with the new heavy cruiser [[German pocket battleship Deutschland|''Deutschland'']].<ref>Williamson ''Light Cruisers'', p. 36</ref> Later that year, ''Schlesien'' was converted into a training ship.<ref name=C222/> Among the modifications were the installation of additional anti-aircraft guns and replacement of the ship's boilers. The newer boilers were more efficient, which allowed fewer of them to be used; the additional space this created was used as crew compartments for the cadets and an instruction room.<ref name=G21>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 21</ref><ref name=C222/> The crew was also altered; the standard crew had been 35 officers and 708 enlisted men; after the conversion, this was reduced to 29 officers and 559 sailors. This was supplemented by 214 cadets.<ref name=G21/> The following year, ''Schlesien'' toured the Americas; in March 1937 the ship stopped in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], Nova Scotia.<ref>Edwards, S., p. 68</ref> Later that year in December, ''Schlesien'' stopped in Argentina.<ref>Newton, p. 184</ref> In 1938, the ship visited [[Saman<U+00E1> Bay]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>Leonard & Bratzel, p. 78</ref>

===World War II===

During the invasion of Poland in September 1939, ''Schlesien'' initially remained in her training ship role, though she briefly acted as an [[icebreaker]] for [[U-boat]]s.<ref name=W8>Williamson ''Battleships'', p. 8</ref> Later in the month, ''Schlesien'' joined her sister ''Schleswig-Holstein'' to bombard Polish positions along the Baltic coast; the bombardments lasted from 25&ndash;27 September.<ref>Rohwer, p. 5</ref> After the operation, ''Schlesien'' had six of her 5.9&nbsp;cm guns removed to arm the new surface raider [[German auxiliary cruiser Pinguin|''Pinguin'']].<ref>Edwards, B., p. 11</ref> In 1940, ''Schlesien'' took part in [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung]], the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. ''Schlesien'' operated in Danish waters throughout the operation.<ref>Rohwer, p. 18</ref> After the occupations were complete, ''Schlesien'' resumed her ice-breaking duties. In March 1941, ''Schlesien'' escorted mine-layers in the Baltic. After returning from this operation, she was to be converted into a barracks ship in [[Gotenhafen]].<ref name=W8/> On 4 April 1942, ''Schlesien'' departed for Gotenhafen in company with the battleship [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and the icebreaker [[German icebreaker Castor|''Castor'']].<ref>Garzke & Dulin, p. 151</ref>

In mid 1944, ''Schlesien''{{'}}s and ''Schleswig-Holstein''{{'}}s anti-aircraft armaments were considerably strengthened to be used as an air defense ships in the port of Gotenhafen.<ref name=W8/> In April 1945, ''Schlesien'' was moved to [[Swinem<U+00FC>nde]] to restock her ammunition supply as well as evacuate 1,000 wounded soldiers from the front.<ref name=W9/> On 3 May she struck a mine at [[Zinnowitz]] outside Swinem<U+00FC>nde and beached in shallow water.<ref name=S233/> Due to the shallow depth, much of the ship remained above water, including her main armament; she was able to provide artillery support for retreating German units.<ref name=W9>Williamson ''Battleships'', p. 9</ref> Between 1949 and 1956, the wreck was demolished and then scrapped ''in situ'' by an East German company.<ref name=G22>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 22</ref><ref name=S233>Slavick, p. 233</ref> However, some remains from the ship were still visible in 1970.<ref name=G22/>
