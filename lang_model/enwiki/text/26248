'''Foreign branding''' is an [[advertising]] and [[marketing]] term describing the implied cachet or superiority of products and services with foreign or foreign-sounding names.

In non-English-speaking countries, many brands use English- or American-styled names. In English and other non-English-speaking countries, many cosmetics and fashion brands use French- or Italian-styled names. Also, Japanese, Scandinavian, and of other origin-sounding names are used in both English- and non-English-speaking countries to achieve specific effects.

* In [[Economy of Japan|Japan]], [[Pocari Sweat]], a popular sports drink marketed in Japan by the [[Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.]], has a name that to many English speakers would imply the product actually contains [[sweat]], rather than the intended meaning of a beverage intended to replace the [[electrolyte]]s lost in sweating.
* [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] is a Japanese manufacturer of electronic music equipment with the name being chosen with the global market in mind. It is, however, difficult to pronounce for Japanese speakers, as [[Japanese speakers learning r and l|they cannot differentiate "l" and "r" sounds]].

* Korea Tobacco and Ginseng Corporation (<U+D55C><U+AD6D><U+B2F4><U+BC30><U+C778><U+C0BC><U+ACF5><U+C0AC> ''Hangukdambaeinsamgongsa''), a corporation formerly owned by the Republic of Korea government, changed its name to KT&G Corporation (<U+C8FC><U+C2DD><U+D68C><U+C0AC> <U+CF00><U+C774><U+D2F0><U+C564><U+C9C0> ''Jusikhoesa keitiaenji'') after privatization.

* [[South Korea]]-based [[LG Electronics]] (<U+C5D8><U+C9C0><U+C804><U+C790> ''Eljijeonja'') named its washer and dryer line [[Tromm]] (<U+D2B8><U+B86C> ''Teurom''). One of the reasons for selecting this foreign-sounding name was to imply to the Korean domestic market a connection to the perceived superior quality of foreign brands - but Tromm is a now a global product line.
* The main news program of Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (<U+BB38><U+D654><U+BC29><U+C1A1><U+C8FC><U+C2DD><U+D68C><U+C0AC> ''Munhwabangsongjushikhoesa''), a broadcaster in South Korea, is called MBC Newsdesk (<U+C5E0><U+BE44><U+C528> <U+B274><U+C2A4><U+B370><U+C2A4><U+D06C> ''Embissi nyuseudeseukeu'').

==Products renamed to avoid offence==
{{See also|Brand blunder}}
* The company [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Bic|Bic]] changed its name from "''Bich''" ({{IPA-fr|bik}}) to prevent it from being mispronounced in English speaking countries as "bitch".
* The [[Mitsubishi Pajero]] had to be renamed to Montero in Spain and Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, since ''pajero'' is a Spanish slang term for one who masturbates (with similar connotations as the [[United Kingdom|British]] slang term [[wanker]]). Mitsubishi originally got the name Pajero from the pampas cat, [[Pampas Cat|''Leopardus pajeros'']].<ref>{{cite web|title=Bigtech Ideasurl=bigtechideas.com/branding-and-graphic-design}}{{date=January 2013}}</ref>
* The [[Honda Fit]] was originally intended to be named the "Fitta", but the name was shortened and in some markets renamed completely upon discovering that in several Nordic languages, ''fitta'' is a vulgar word for the female genitalia.
* [[Buick]] initially chose to rename its [[Buick LaCrosse|Lacrosse]] to Allure in Canada; a slang term meaning "to cross oneself" was a euphemism for masturbation in [[Quebec French lexicon|Quebec]]. GM reversed its position in 2009, returning the LaCrosse nameplate.<ref name='Cancilla'>{{cite web | last = Cancilla | first = Patricia | date = September 3, 2009 | url = http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posteddriving/archive/2009/09/03/buick-allure-now-lacrosse-in-canada.aspx | title = Buick Allure now LaCrosse in Canada | work = [[National Post]] | accessdate = 2009-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gminsidenews.com/forums/f70/canada-buick-allure-now-called-lacrosse-83787/ |title=Canada: Buick Allure Now Called LaCrosse |author=Saporito, Nick |work=GM Inside News |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-13}}</ref>
* The [[SEAT M<U+00E1>laga]] was marketed in Greece as the Seat Gredos, because the word Malaga was considered very similar to ''[[malaka]]'', a common Greek swear word for one who masturbates.
* The U.S. fast food chain [[Taco Bell]] formerly sold a [[burrito]] called a chili-cheese burrito. Its name was changed when many people became aware that the original name, "''Chilito''", is used as a slang term for a small penis.
* The [[Ford Maverick]] was intended to be marketed in [[Brazil]] as the [[Ford Pinto]],<ref>http://www.getcustoms.com/2004XE/Articles/ga-2004-01-12.html</ref> but no one in Brazil would identify Pinto as a horse breed, since ''pinto'' (a small chicken) is a Brazilian informal term for "penis".<ref>http://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno/ingles/index.php?lingua=portugues-ingles&palavra=pinto</ref>
* In [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia]], and [[Montenegro]], [[Nestl<U+00E9>]] could not sell [[instant coffee]] called Kenjara because the name resembles [[Serbo-Croatian]] vulgar words related to defecation.
* The Toyota MR2 sportscar is named MR in France, because a way of pronouncing it, "merdeux", sounds like the word for "shitty" in French.
* The computer Commodore VIC-20 was renamed to VC-20 in Germany, since VIC would be pronounced the same as ''fick'' ("fuck" in German).
* The [[Vicks]] brand of over-the-counter cough medication was renamed ''Wick'' in Germany, to avoid too much a similarity with the German word ''wichsen'' meaning "to wank".{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}
* In [[Israel]], Korean car company [[Kia Motors]] adjusted their original pronunciation ({{IPA-ko|ki.a|IPA}}) to sound like "Kaya" in promotional material, since a Hebrew slang pronunciation for "vomit" (<U+05E7><U+05D9><U+05D0>) sounds like the original brand name. This decision was later reversed, and now the company uses the normal pronunciation.
*[[Church's Chicken]] is known as Texas Chicken outside of North America, presumably to appeal to non-Christians who would not understand it was named for its founder George Church, and not a religious group.
* The word "mist" must be avoided in German trademarks; while harmless in English, it translates to garbage.
* Although the Mexican bakery [[Grupo Bimbo|Bimbo]] uses its real name in English-speaking markets, it emphasizes the word "Bimbo" is pronounced "beam-bo" to avoid the negative connotations associated with the word "[[bimbo]]" in American English.
* In Portugal, [[Opel Ascona]] was marketed as Opel 1604 because the model name is similar to a slang word for female genitalia, ''cona''.

==Foreign orthography==
Foreign letters and diacritical marks (such as the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|''umlaut'']]) are often used to give a foreign flavor to a brand that does not consist of foreign terms.

===Characters chosen for visual resemblance===
====Greek characters in Latin contexts====
* The Greek [[sigma]], <U+03A3>, is often used for Latin E, although it is the equivalent of Latin S. Examples include the film ''[[My Big Fat Greek Wedding]]'' (stylized as My Big Fat GR<U+03A3><U+03A3>K Wedding) and [[ABC Family]]'s college-set series ''[[Greek (TV series)]] (stylized as GR<U+03A3><U+03A3>K)''.
* Less commonly, [[delta (letter)|delta]] <U+0394> or [[lambda]] <U+039B> may be used for A, or [[theta]] <U+0398> for O. Examples include [[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]], in which the title is stylised as "<U+039B>TL<U+039B>NTIS".
* The lower-case Greek lambda, <U+03BB>, was used for Latin A in the video game ''[[Half-Life (video game)|H<U+03BB>lf-Life]]'', apparently in reference to the use of <U+03BB> as the symbol for the [[decay constant]] (related to the concept of [[half-life]]).

====Cyrillic characters in Latin contexts====
{{main|Faux Cyrillic}}
* Cyrillic [[Ya (Cyrillic)|Ya]], <U+042F>, and [[I (Cyrillic)|I]], <U+0418>, resemble the reversed Latin letters R and N, respectively, and are often used as such. Examples include the video game [[Tetris (Tengen unlicensed)|TET<U+042F>IS]].
* Cyrillic [[De (Cyrillic)|De]], <U+0414>, may be used for Latin A, as in the film [[Borat|BOR<U+0414>T]].

====Other scripts====
[[Image:Faux Hebrew.png|thumbnail|right|Hebrew foreign branding; note the use of actual Hebrew letters alef <U+05D0> (for X) and shin <U+05E9> (for W).]]
* The London-based sushi restaurant [[YO! Sushi]] uses a typeface that makes the Y and O look like the katakana letters [[<U+30EA>]] and [[<U+30AF>]] ([[romaji]]: ''ri'' and ''ku'').
* Letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] can be used to evoke Jewish culture.
* The television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' use a glyph resembling [[<U+00C5>]] in marketing materials, thus "STARG<U+00C5>TE SG-1" and "STARGATE ATL<U+00C5>NTIS", respectively. This usage derives from the symbol representing [[Earth]] on the titular [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]], and is unrelated to the letter as used in the [[Swedish alphabet]] (which is pronounced similar to English "o").

===Diacritics and foreign spellings===
* The name of the French soft drink [[Pschitt]] is merely an [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] rendition of the sound made when the bottle is opened, but the ''-sch-'' and terminal ''-tt'' are [[German language|German]], rather than French, clusters.
* A premium-priced [[ice cream]] made by a company based in [[Bronx, New York]] was dubbed [[H<U+00E4>agen-Dazs]] to imply "old world craftsmanship and tradition". H<U+00E4>agen-Dazs has no meaning in any [[Europe]]an language, although it contains several conventions used in European languages, such as the umlaut. H<U+00E4>agen-Dazs spawned imitators, such as [[Frusen Gl<U+00E4>dj<U+00E9>]] (''frusen gl<U+00E4>dje'' without the acute accent meaning "frozen joy" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]), another brand of premium ice cream. H<U+00E4>agen Dazs sued unsuccessfully in 1980 to stop them from using a "Scandinavian marketing theme".
* [[Le Tigre Clothing]], an American brand which adopted a French name, has at times used an accent over the final "e" in ''tigre'' (French for [[tiger]]), although the French word itself contains no accent.<ref>Richard Jackson Harris, ''A Cognitive Psychology of Mass Communication'' (2004), p. 101.</ref>
* [[Plymouth Volar<U+00E9>]] contains an accent which is absent from the original [[Italian language|Italian]] word "volare" (meaning "to fly, soar, fly by, fall off, or pass quickly"). 
* The fashion for the [[metal umlaut]] (use of umlauts in the names of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands) can also be seen as a form of foreign branding.

===Characters chosen by keyboard or encoding match===
Where different [[keyboard layout]]s or [[character encoding]]s map different scripts to the same key positions or code points, directly converting matching characters provides an alternative to [[transliteration]] when the appearance, rather than the meaning, is desired.
* The cover of Madonna's ''[[GHV2|Greatest Hits Volume 2]]'' contains the [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] characters <U+30E2><U+30C2><U+30B8><U+30E9><U+30DF><U+30DF><U+30C2>. These characters share the same keys on a dual-layout Japanese/English keyboard as the letters M-A-D-O-N-N-A. The characters are otherwise unrelated and the resulting Japanese text ("mo-dji-ji-ra-mi-mi-dji") is meaningless.
