A '''eukaryote''' ({{IPAc-en|ju<U+02D0>|<U+02C8>|k|<U+00E6>r|i|.|o<U+028A>|t}} {{Respell|yoo|KARR|ee-oht}}) is any [[organism]] whose [[Cell (biology)|cells]] contain a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other structures ([[organelles]]) enclosed within [[Biological membrane|membranes]]. Eukaryotes are formally the [[taxon]] '''Eukarya''' or '''Eukaryota'''. The defining membrane-bound structure that sets eukaryotic cells apart from [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cells is the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or [[nuclear envelope]], within which the genetic material is contained.<ref name="Youngson">{{cite book| last= Youngson| first= Robert M.| title= Collins Dictionary of Human Biology| year= 2006| publisher= HarperCollins| location= Glasgow| isbn= 0-00-722134-7}}</ref><ref name="Nelson&Cox">{{Cite book|last1= Nelson|given1= David L. |surname2= Cox|given2= Michael M.|year=2005|title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|edition=4th|publication-place=New York|publisher=W.H.

In addition, plants and [[algae]] contain [[chloroplast]]s. Many [[protist|unicellular organisms]] are eukaryotes, such as [[protozoa]]. All multicellular organisms are eukaryotes, including [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and [[fungus|fungi]].

[[Cell division]] in eukaryotes is different from that in organisms without a nucleus ([[Prokaryote]]). There are two types of division processes. In [[mitosis]], one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cells. In [[meiosis]], which is required in [[sexual reproduction]], one [[diploid]] cell (having two instances of each chromosome, one from each parent) undergoes [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] of each pair of parental chromosomes, and then two stages of cell division, resulting in four [[haploid]] cells ([[gametes]]). Each gamete has just one complement of chromosomes, each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomes.

The [[domain (biology)|domain]] Eukaryota appears to be [[monophyletic]], and so makes up one of the three domains of life. The two other domains, [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]], are [[prokaryote]]s and have none of the above features. Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things;<ref>{{Cite journal |author= Whitman W, Coleman D, Wiebe W |title= Prokaryotes: The unseen majority |doi= 10.1073/pnas.95.12.6578 |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume= 95 |issue= 12 |pages= 6578<U+2013>83 |year= 1998 |pmid= 9618454 |pmc= 33863 |bibcode= 1998PNAS...95.6578W }}</ref> even in a human body there are 10 times more microbes than human cells.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zimmer|first=Carl|title=How Microbes Defend and Define Us|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13micro.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all|accessdate=17 July 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 July 2010}} See also [[microbiome]].</ref> However, due to their much larger size, their collective worldwide biomass is estimated at about equal to that of prokaryotes.<ref name="Whitman etal">Whitman, Coleman, and Wiebe, [http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/95/12/6578.pdf Prokaryotes: The unseen majority], Proc.

==Cell features==
Eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those of [[prokaryote]]s. They have a variety of internal membranes and structures, called [[organelle]]s, and a [[cytoskeleton]] composed of [[microtubule]]s, [[microfilament]]s, and [[intermediate filament]]s, which play an important role in defining the cell's organization and shape. Eukaryotic [[DNA]] is divided into several linear bundles called [[chromosome]]s, which are separated by a microtubular spindle during nuclear division.

[[File:Endomembrane system diagram.svg|thumb|350px|right|Detail of the endomembrane system and its components]]

===Internal membrane===
Eukaryote cells include a variety of membrane-bound structures, collectively referred to as the [[endomembrane system]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Evolutionary Integration of Chloroplast Metabolism with the Metabolic Networks of the Cells|editors=Burnap, Robert L. & Vermaas, Willem F.J.|title=Functional Genomics and Evolution of Photosynthetic Systems|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9789400715332|page=215|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WfzEgaLibuwC&pg=PA215|author=Linka, Marc & Weber, Andreas P.M.}}</ref> Simple compartments, called [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] or [[vacuole]]s, can form by budding off other membranes. Many cells ingest food and other materials through a process of [[endocytosis]], where the outer membrane [[Invagination|invaginates]] and then pinches off to form a vesicle. It is probable that most other membrane-bound organelles are ultimately derived from such vesicles.

The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane (commonly referred to as a [[nuclear envelope]]), with pores that allow material to move in and out. Various tube- and sheet-like extensions of the nuclear membrane form what is called the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] or ER, which is involved in protein transport and maturation. It includes the rough ER where [[ribosome]]s are attached to synthesize proteins, which enter the interior space or lumen. Subsequently, they generally enter vesicles, which bud off from the smooth ER. In most eukaryotes, these protein-carrying vesicles are released and further modified in stacks of flattened vesicles, called [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi bodies]] or dictyosomes.

[[File:Mitochondrion structure.svg|thumb|left|400px|Simplified structure of a mitochondrion]]
Vesicles may be specialized for various purposes. For instance, [[lysosome]]s contain enzymes that break down the contents of food vacuoles, and [[peroxisome]]s are used to break down [[peroxide]], which is toxic otherwise. Many [[protozoa]] have contractile vacuoles, which collect and expel excess water, and [[extrusome]]s, which expel material used to deflect predators or capture prey. In higher plants, most of a cell's volume is taken up by a central vacuole, which primarily maintains its osmotic pressure.

===Mitochondria and plastids===
[[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are organelles found in nearly all eukaryotes.<ref>http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2006-05/1146679455.Ev.r.html</ref> They are surrounded by two membranes (each a [[Lipid bilayer|phospholipid bi-layer]]), the inner of which is folded into invaginations called cristae, where [[aerobic respiration]] takes place. Mitochondria contain their own DNA. They are now generally held to have developed from [[endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] prokaryotes, probably [[proteobacteria]]. The few protozoa that lack mitochondria have been found to contain mitochondrion-derived organelles, such as [[hydrogenosome]]s and [[mitosome]]s; and thus probably lost the mitochondria secondarily.

Plants and various groups of [[algae]] also have [[plastid]]s. Again, these have their own DNA and developed from endosymbiotes, in this case [[cyanobacteria]]. They usually take the form of [[chloroplast]]s, which like cyanobacteria contain [[chlorophyll]] and produce organic compounds (such as [[glucose]]) through [[photosynthesis]]. Others are involved in storing food. Although plastids likely had a single origin, not all plastid-containing groups are closely related. Instead, some eukaryotes have obtained them from others through secondary endosymbiosis or ingestion.

Endosymbiotic origins have also been proposed for the nucleus, for which see below, and for eukaryotic [[flagellum|flagella]], supposed to have developed from [[spirochaete]]s.{{Clarify|how? outline the hypothesis|date=May 2013}} This is not generally accepted, both from a lack of [[Cell biology|cytological]] evidence and difficulty in reconciling this with cellular reproduction.

===Cytoskeletal structures===
{{Main | Cytoskeleton}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Chlamydomonas TEM 09.jpg|thumb|Longitudinal section through the flagellum of ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'']]
Many eukaryotes have long slender motile cytoplasmic projections, called [[flagellum|flagella]], or similar structures called [[cilium|cilia]]. Flagella and cilia are sometimes referred to as [[undulipodia]],<ref>[[Lynn Margulis]], Heather I. McKhann & Lorraine Olendzenski (ed.), ''Illustrated Glossary of Protoctista'', Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, 1993, p.xviii. ISBN 0-86720-081-2</ref> and are variously involved in movement, feeding, and sensation. They are composed mainly of [[tubulin]]. These are entirely distinct from prokaryotic flagellae. They are supported by a bundle of microtubules arising from a [[basal body]], also called a [[kinetosome]] or [[centriole]], characteristically arranged as nine doublets surrounding two singlets. Flagella also may have hairs, or [[mastigonemes]], and scales connecting membranes and internal rods. Their interior is continuous with the cell's [[cytoplasm]].

Microfilamental structures composed of [[actin]] and actin binding proteins, e.g., <U+03B1>-[[actinin]], [[fimbrin]], [[filamin]] are present in submembraneous cortical layers and bundles, as well. [[Motor protein]]s of microtubules, e.g., [[dynein]] or [[kinesin]] and actin, e.g., [[myosins]] provide dynamic character of the network.

[[Centrioles]] are often present even in cells and groups that do not have flagella, but [[coniferophyta|conifers]] and [[angiosperm|flowering plants]] have neither. They generally occur in groups of one or two, called [[kinetids]], that give rise to various microtubular roots. These form a primary component of the cytoskeletal structure, and are often assembled over the course of several cell divisions, with one flagellum retained from the parent and the other derived from it. Centrioles may also be associated in the formation of a spindle during nuclear division.

The significance of cytoskeletal structures is underlined in the determination of shape of the cells, as well as their being essential components of migratory responses like [[chemotaxis]] and [[chemokinesis]]. Some protists have various other microtubule-supported organelles. These include the [[radiolaria]] and [[heliozoa]], which produce [[axopodia]] used in flotation or to capture prey, and the [[haptophyte]]s, which have a peculiar flagellum-like organelle called the [[haptonema]].

===Cell wall===
{{Further2|[[Cell wall]]}}

The cells of plants, fungi, and most chromalveolates have a cell wall, a layer outside the [[cell membrane]], providing the cell with structural support,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} protection, and a filtering mechanism. The cell wall also prevents over-expansion when water enters the cell.

The major [[polysaccharides]] making up the primary cell wall of [[land plants]] are [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[pectin]]. The cellulose [[microfibril]]s are linked via hemicellulosic tethers to form the cellulose-hemicellulose network, which is embedded in the pectin matrix. The most common hemicellulose in the primary cell wall is [[xyloglucan]].

==Differences among eukaryotic cells==
There are many different types of eukaryotic cells, though animals and plants are the most familiar eukaryotes, and thus provide an excellent starting point for understanding eukaryotic structure. Fungi and many protists have some substantial differences, however.

===Animal cell===
[[File:Animal cell structure en.svg|thumb|350px|right|Structure of a typical animal cell]]
[[File:C<U+00E9>lula animal.ogv|thumb|350px|right|3D Simulation of animal cell]]
[[File:Plant cell structure svg.svg|thumb|350px|Structure of a typical [[plant cell]]]]
An '''animal cell''' is a form of eukaryotic cell that makes up many [[Biological tissue|tissues]] in [[animal]]s. Animal cells are distinct from other eukaryotes, most notably [[plant cells]], as they lack [[cell wall]]s and [[chloroplast]]s. They also have smaller [[vacuole]]s. Due to the lack of a [[cell wall]], animal cells can adopt a variety of shapes. A [[phagocyte|phagocytic]] cell can even engulf other structures.

There are many different [[cell type|types of cell]]. For instance, there are approximately 210 [[distinct cell types in the adult human body]].

===Plant cell===
{{Further2|[[Plant cell]]}}

Plant [[cell (biology)|cells]] are quite different from the cells of the other eukaryotic organisms. Their distinctive features are:

* A large central [[vacuole]] (enclosed by a membrane, the [[tonoplast]]), which maintains the cell's [[turgor]] and controls movement of [[molecule]]s between the [[cytosol]] and [[plant sap|sap]]<ref name=Raven1987>{{cite journal| last=Raven | first=J. A. | year=1987 | title=The role of vacuoles | journal= New Phytologist | volume=106 | pages=357<U+2013>422 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1987.tb00149.x}}</ref>
* A primary [[cell wall]] containing [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[pectin]], deposited by the [[protoplast]] on the outside of the [[cell membrane]]; this contrasts with the cell walls of [[fungus|fungi]], which contain [[chitin]], and the [[cell envelope]]s of prokaryotes, in which [[peptidoglycan]]s are the main structural molecules
* The [[plasmodesmata]], linking pores in the cell wall that allow each plant cell to communicate with other adjacent cells;<ref name=Oparka>{{cite book | last=Oparka | first=K. | year=2005 | title=Plasmodesmata | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | location=Oxford, UK}}</ref> this is different from the functionally analogous system of [[gap junction]]s between animal cells.
* [[Plastid]]s, especially [[chloroplast]]s that contain [[chlorophyll]], the pigment that gives [[plant]]s their green color and allows them to perform [[photosynthesis]]
* [[Bryophyte]]s and [[pteridophyte|seedless vascular plants]] lack flagellae and centrioles except in the sperm cells.<ref name="Raven">{{cite book| last1=Raven | first1=P.H.| last2=Evert | first2=R.F. | last3=Eichorm | first3=S.E. | year=1999| title= Biology of Plants |  publisher=W.H. Freeman | location=New York | isbn= }}</ref> Sperm of [[cycad]]s and ''[[Gingko]]'' are large, complex cells that swim with hundreds to thousands of flagellae.<ref name="Silflow">{{cite journal| last1=Silflow | first1=C.D. | last2=Lefebvre | first2=P.A. | year=2001 | title=Assembly and Motility of Eukaryotic Cilia and Flagella. Lessons from ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'' | journal= Plant Physiology | volume=127 | pages=1500<U+2013>1507 | doi=10.1104/pp.010807}}</ref>
* [[Pinophyta|Conifers]] (Pinophyta) and [[flowering plant]]s (Angiospermae) lack the [[flagellum|flagellae]] and [[centriole]]s that are present in [[#Animal cell|animal cells]].

===Fungal cell===
[[File:HYPHAE.png|thumb|'''Fungal Hyphae Cells'''<br /> 1- Hyphal wall 2- Septum 3- Mitochondrion 4- Vacuole 5- [[Ergosterol]] crystal 6- Ribosome 7- Nucleus 8- Endoplasmic reticulum 9- Lipid body 10- Plasma membrane 11- [[Spitzenk<U+00F6>rper]] 12- Golgi apparatus]]
'''Fungal cells''' are most similar to animal cells, with the following exceptions:

* A cell wall that contains [[chitin]]
* Less definition between cells; the [[hypha]]e of higher fungi have porous partitions called [[septum|septa]], which allow the passage of cytoplasm, organelles, and, sometimes, nuclei. Primitive fungi have few or no septa, so each organism is essentially a giant multinucleate supercell; these fungi are described as [[coenocytic]].
* Only the most primitive fungi, [[chytrid]]s, have flagella.

===Other eukaryotic cells===
Eukaryotes are a very diverse group, and their cell structures are equally diverse. Many have cell walls; many do not. Many have chloroplasts, derived from primary, secondary, or even tertiary endosymbiosis; and many do not. Some groups have unique structures, such as the [[cyanelle]]s of the [[glaucophyte]]s, the [[haptonema]] of the [[haptophyte]]s, or the [[ejectisomes]] of the [[cryptomonad]]s. Other structures, such as [[pseudopod]]s, are found in various eukaryote groups in different forms, such as the lobose [[amoebozoa]]ns or the reticulose [[foraminiferan]]s.

==Reproduction==
Nuclear division is often coordinated with [[cell division]]. This generally takes place by [[mitosis]], a process that allows each daughter nucleus to receive one copy of each chromosome. In most eukaryotes, there is also a process of sexual reproduction, typically involving an alternation between [[haploid]] generations, wherein only one copy of each chromosome is present, and [[diploid]] generations, wherein two are present, occurring through nuclear fusion (syngamy) and [[meiosis]]. There is considerable variation in this pattern, however.

Eukaryotes have a smaller surface area to volume ratio than prokaryotes, and thus have lower metabolic rates and longer generation times. In some multicellular organisms, cells specialized for metabolism will have enlarged surface areas, such as intestinal vili.

===Sexual reproduction===
Sexual reproduction is widespread among present day eukaryotes, and evidence suggests that it is a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dacks J, Roger AJ |title=The first sexual lineage and the relevance of facultative sex |journal=J. Mol. Evol. |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=779<U+2013>83 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10229582 |doi= 10.1007/PL00013156|url=}}</ref> A core set of genes that function in meiosis is present in both [[Trichomonas vaginalis]] and [[Giardia intestinalis]], two organisms previously thought to be asexual.<ref name=Ramesh>{{cite journal |author=Ramesh MA, Malik SB, Logsdon JM |title=A phylogenomic inventory of meiotic genes; evidence for sex in Giardia and an early eukaryotic origin of meiosis |journal=Curr.

For instance, parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania have recently been shown to have a sexual cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Akopyants NS, Kimblin N, Secundino N, et al. |title=Demonstration of genetic exchange during cyclical development of Leishmania in the sand fly vector |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5924 |pages=265<U+2013>8 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19359589 |pmc=2729066 |doi=10.1126/science.1169464 |url=|bibcode = 2009Sci...324..265A }}</ref> Also, evidence now indicates that amoeba, that were previously regarded as asexual, are anciently sexual and that the majority of present day asexual groups likely arose recently and independently.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lahr DJ, Parfrey LW, Mitchell EA, Katz LA, Lara E |title=The chastity of amoebae: re-evaluating evidence for sex in amoeboid organisms |journal=Proc.

Extant protists usually reproduce asexually under favorable conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as nutritional limitation and [[heat shock]].<ref name=Bernstein>Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2012).

The [[rRNA]] trees constructed during the 1980s and 1990s left most eukaryotes in an unresolved "crown" group (not technically a true [[crown group|crown]]), which was usually divided by the form of the mitochondrial cristae; see [[crown eukaryotes]].

{{As of|2011}}, there is widespread agreement that the Rhizaria belong with the Stramenopiles and the Alveolata, in a clade dubbed the [[SAR supergroup]], so that Rhizara is not one of the main eukaryote groups; also that the Amoebozoa and Opisthokonta are each monophyletic and form a clade, often called the [[unikont]]s.<ref name="Burki2007">{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000790|title=Phylogenomics Reshuffles the Eukaryotic Supergroups|author=Fabien Burki, Kamran Shalchian-Tabrizi, Marianne Minge, <U+00C5>smund Skj<U+00E6>veland, Sergey I.

The known eukaryote genome sizes vary from 8.2 megabases (Mb) in ''[[Babesia bovis]]'' to 112,000<U+2013>220,050 Mb in the dinoflagellate ''[[Prorocentrum micans]]'', suggesting that the genome of the ancestral eukaryote has undergone considerable variation during its evolution.<ref name="Jagus2012"/> The last common ancestor of all eukaryotes is believed to have been a phagotrophic protist with a nucleus, at least one [[centriole]] and [[cilium]], facultatively aerobic mitochondria, sex ([[meiosis]] and [[syngamy]]), a dormant [[cyst]] with a cell wall of [[chitin]] and/or [[cellulose]] and [[peroxisome]]s.<ref name="Jagus2012"/> Later endosymbiosis led to the spread of plastids in some lineages.

====Chromalveolata + Rhizaria====
Some analyses disassemble the Chromalveolata + Rhizaria, showing close relationships with the Archaeplastida. For example, in 2007, Burki ''et al.'' produced a tree of the form shown below.<ref name="Burki2007"/>

In another analysis, the Hacrobia are shown nested inside the Archaeplastida, which together form a clade with most of the Excavata, before joining the SAR clade of Stramenopiles, Alveolata and Rhizaria.

The division of the eukaryotes into two primary clades, unikonts and bikonts, derived from an ancestral uniflagellar organism and an ancestral biflagellar organism, respectively, had been suggested earlier.<ref name="CavalierSmith2006">{{cite journal |author=[[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] |title=Protist phylogeny and the high-level classification of Protozoa |journal=European Journal of Protistology |year=2006 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=338<U+2013>348 |doi=10.1078/0932-4739-00002}}</ref><ref name="pmid16829542">{{cite journal |author=Burki F, Pawlowski J |title=Monophyly of Rhizaria and multigene phylogeny of unicellular bikonts |journal=Mol.

====Expanded Chromalveolata====
Other analyses place the SAR supergroup within an expanded Chromalveolata, although they differ on the placement of the resulting five groups.

A paper published in 2009, which re-examined the data used in some of the analyses presented above as well as performing new ones, strongly suggested that the Archaeplastida are polyphyletic. The phylogeny finally proposed in the paper is shown below.<ref name="pmid19698794">{{cite journal |author=Nozaki H, Maruyama S, Matsuzaki M, Nakada T, Kato S, Misawa K |title=Phylogenetic positions of Glaucophyta, green plants (Archaeplastida) and Haptophyta (Chromalveolata) as deduced from slowly evolving nuclear genes |journal=Mol.

The origin of the eukaryotic cell is considered a milestone in the evolution of life, since eukaryotes include all complex cells and almost all multicellular organisms. The timing of this series of events is hard to determine; [[Andrew H. Knoll|Knoll]] (2006) suggests they developed approximately 1.6<U+2013>2.1 billion years ago. Some [[acritarch]]s are known from at least 1.65 billion years ago, and the possible alga ''[[Grypania]]'' has been found as far back as 2.1 billion years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Andrew H. |last= Knoll |coauthors= Javaux, E.J, Hewitt, D. and Cohen, P. |title= Eukaryotic organisms in Proterozoic oceans |journal= [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |year=2006 |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=1023<U+2013>38 |pmc=1578724 |doi= 10.1098/rstb.2006.1843 |pmid= 16754612}}</ref>

===Relationship to Archaea===
Eukaryotes are more closely related to [[Archaea]] than [[Bacteria]], at least in terms of nuclear DNA and genetic machinery, and one controversial idea is to place them with Archaea in the clade [[Neomura]]. However, in other respects, such as membrane composition, eukaryotes are similar to Bacteria. Three main explanations for this have been proposed:

* Eukaryotes resulted from the complete fusion of two or more cells, wherein the cytoplasm formed from a [[eubacterium]], and the nucleus from an archaeon,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin W |title=Archaebacteria (Archaea) and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Curr.

===Endomembrane system and mitochondria===
The origins of the endomembrane system and mitochondria are also unclear.<ref>{{cite journal |author=J<U+00E9>kely G |title=Origin of eukaryotic endomembranes: a critical evaluation of different model scenarios |journal=Adv.

In a study using genomes to construct [[supertree]]s, Pisani ''et al.'' (2007) suggest that, along with evidence that there was never a mitochondrion-less eukaryote, eukaryotes evolved from a [[syntrophy]] between an archaea closely related to [[Thermoplasmatales]] and an [[Alphaproteobacteria|<U+03B1>-proteobacterium]], likely a [[symbiosis]] driven by sulfur or hydrogen. The mitochondrion and its genome is a remnant of the <U+03B1>-proteobacterial endosymbiont.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Supertrees disentangle the chimerical origin of eukaryotic genomes| author=Pisani D, Cotton JA, McInerney JO| journal= Mol Biol Evol.| year=2007|volume=24|issue=8| pages=1752<U+2013>60| pmid=17504772 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msm095}}</ref>

===Hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes===

Different [[hypotheses]] have been proposed as to how eukaryotic cells came into existence. These hypotheses can be classified into two distinct classes <U+2013> autogenous models and chimeric models.

====Autogenous models====
{{Plain image with caption|Serial endosymbiosis.svg|An autogenous model for the origin of eukaryotes.|360px}}

Autogenous models propose that a proto-eukaryotic cell containing a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] existed first, and later acquired [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Latorre|first=A.|title=The role of symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution. Origins and evolution of life <U+2013> An astrobiological perspective|year=2011|pages=326<U+2013>339|coauthors=Durban, A., Moya, A. & Pereto, J.|chapter=21}}</ref> 
According to this model, a large [[prokaryote]] developed [[invaginations]] in its [[plasma membrane]] in order to obtain enough [[surface area to volume ratio|surface area]] to service its [[cytoplasmic]] volume. As the invaginations differentiated in function, some became separate compartments<U+2014>giving rise to the [[endomembrane system]], including the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[golgi apparatus]], [[nuclear membrane]], and single membrane structures such as [[lysosome]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=S|first=J Ayala|title=Transport and internal organization of membranes: vesicles, membrane networks and GTP-binding proteins|journal=Journal of Cell Science|date=April 1, 1994|issue=107|pages=753<U+2013>763|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/107/4/753.long|accessdate=27 March 2013|pmid=8056835|volume=107}}</ref>
[[Mitochondria]] are proposed to come from the [[endosymbiosis]] of an aerobic [[proteobacterium]], and it's assumed that all the eukaryotic lineages that did not acquire mitochondria went extinct.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=William F|title=The Origin of Mitochondria|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356|work=Scitable|publisher=Nature education|accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref> 
Chloroplasts came about from another endosymbiotic event involving [[cyanobacteria]]. Since all eukaryotes have mitochondria, but not all have chloroplasts, mitochondria are thought to have come first. This is the [[serial endosymbiosis]] theory.

Some models propose that the origins of double layered [[organelle]]s, such as mitochondria and [[chloroplasts]], in the proto-eukaryotic cell is due to the compartmentalization of [[DNA]] vesicles that were formed from the secondary invaginations or more detailed infoldings of cellular membrane.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

====Chimeric models====
Chimeric models claim that two prokaryotic cells existed initially <U+2013> an [[Archaea|archaeon]] and a [[Bacteria|bacterium]]. These cells underwent a merging process, either by a physical fusion or by [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]], thereby leading to the formation of a eukaryotic cell. Within these chimeric models, some studies further claim that mitochondria originated from a bacterial ancestor while others emphasize the role of endosymbiotic processes behind the origin of mitochondria.

Based on the process of [[Symbiosis#Mutualism|mutualistic symbiosis]], the hypotheses can be categorized as <U+2013> the serial [[Endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] theory (SET),<ref>{{cite book|last=Margulis|first=L.|title=Origin of Eukaryotic Cells.|year=1970|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, London}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Margulis|first=L.|title=Symbiosis in Cell Evolution.|year=1993|publisher=W.

According to serial endosymbiotic theory, a union between a motile [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacterium (like ''Spirochaeta'') and a thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon (like ''Thermoplasma'' which is sulfidogenic in nature) gave rise to the present day eukaryotes. This union established a motile organism capable of living in the already existing acidic and sulfurous waters. Oxygen is known to cause toxicity to organisms that lack the required [[Metabolism|metabolic]] machinery. Thus, the archaeon provided the bacterium with a highly beneficial reduced environment (sulfur and sulfate were reduced to sulfide). In microaerophilic conditions, oxygen was reduced to water thereby creating a mutual benefit platform. The bacterium on the other hand, contributed the necessary [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] products and [[electron]] acceptors along with its motility feature to the archaeon thereby gaining a swimming [[motility]] for the organism. From a consortium of bacterial and archaeal DNA originated the nuclear [[genome]] of eukaryotic cells. [[Spirochete]]s gave rise to the motile features of eukaryotic cells. Endosymbiotic unifications of the ancestors of alpha-proteobacteria and cyanobacteria, led to the origin of mitochondria and [[plastid]]s respectively. For example, ''Thiodendron'' has been known to have originated via an [[Ectosymbiosis|ectosymbiotic]] process based on a similar [[syntrophy]] of sulfur existing between the two types of bacteria <U+2013> ''Desulphobacter'' and ''Spirochaeta''. However, such an association based on motile symbiosis have never been observed practically. Also there is no evidence of archaeans and spirochetes adapting to intense acid-based environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Latorre|first=A.|coauthors=Durban, A., Moya, A. & Pereto, J.|title=The role of symbiosis in eukaryotic evolution. Origins and evolution of life <U+2013> An astrobiological perspective|year=2011|pages=326<U+2013>339}}</ref>

In the hydrogen hypothesis, the symbiotic linkage of an anaerobic and [[autotroph]]ic methanogenic archaeon (host) with an alpha-proteobacterium (the symbiont) gave rise to the eukaryotes. The host utilized [[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) and [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) to produce [[methane]] while the symbiont, capable of aerobic respiration, expelled H<sub>2</sub> and {{CO2}} as byproducts of anaerobic fermentation process. The host's methanogenic environment worked as a sink for H<sub>2</sub>, which resulted in heightened bacterial fermentation. Endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) acted as a catalyst for the host to acquire the symbionts' [[carbohydrate]] metabolism and turn [[heterotroph]]ic in nature. Subsequently, the host's methane forming capability was lost. Thus, the origins of the heterotrophic organelle (symbiont) are identical to the origins of the eukaryotic [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]]. In this hypothesis, the presence of H<sub>2</sub> represents the selective force that forged eukaryotes out of prokaryotes.

The syntrophy hypothesis was developed in contrast to the hydrogen hypothesis and proposes the existence of two symbiotic events. According to this theory, eukaryogenesis (i.e. origin of eukaryotic cells) occurred based on metabolic symbiosis (syntrophy) between a methanogenic archaeon and a delta-proteobacterium. This syntrophic symbiosis was initially facilitated by H<sub>2</sub> transfer between different species under anaerobic environments. In earlier stages, an alpha-proteobacterium became a member of this integration, and later developed into the mitochondrion. [[Gene]] transfer from a delta-proteobacterium to an archaeon led to the methanogenic archaeon developing into a nucleus. The archaeon constituted the genetic apparatus while the delta-proteobacterium contributed towards the [[cytoplasm]]ic features. This theory incorporates two selective forces that were needed to be considered during the time of nucleus [[evolution]] <U+2013> (a) presence of metabolic partitioning in order to avoid the harmful effects of the co-existence of [[Anabolism|anabolic]] and [[Catabolism|catabolic]] cellular pathways, and (b) prevention of abnormal [[Protein biosynthesis|biosynthesis of proteins]] that occur due to a vast spread of [[intron]]s in the archaeal genes after acquiring the mitochondrion and the loss of [[methanogenesis]].

Thus, the origin of eukaryotes by endosymbiotic processes has been broadly recognized and accepted so far. Mitochondria and plastids have been known to originate from a bacterial ancestor during parallel adaptation to anaerobiosis. However, there still remains a greater need in assessing the question of how much eukaryotic complexity is being originated via an implementation of these [[Symbiogenesis|symbiogenetic]] theories.
