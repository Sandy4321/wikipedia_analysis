'''''H.M.S. Pinafore; or, The Lass that Loved a Sailor''''' is a [[comic opera]] in two acts, with music by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and a [[libretto]] by [[W. S. Gilbert]].  It opened at the [[Opera Comique]] in [[London]], England, on 25 May 1878 and ran for 571&nbsp;performances, which was the second-longest run of any [[musical theatre]] piece up to that time.  ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' was [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s fourth operatic collaboration and their first international sensation.

The story takes place aboard the titular ship, ''H.M.S. Pinafore''. The [[naval captain|captain]]'s daughter, Josephine, is in love with a lower-class [[Able Seaman (rank)|sailor]], Ralph Rackstraw, although her father intends her to marry Sir Joseph Porter, the [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]].  She abides by her father's wishes at first, but Sir Joseph's advocacy of the equality of humankind encourages Ralph and Josephine to overturn conventional social order.  They declare their love for each other and eventually plan to elope.  The captain discovers this plan, but, as in many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise disclosure changes things dramatically near the end of the story.  

Drawing on several of his earlier "[[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]]" poems, Gilbert imbued this plot with mirth and silliness.  The opera's humour focuses on love between members of different [[social class]]es and lampoons the British class system in general.  ''Pinafore'' also pokes good-natured fun at [[patriotism]], party politics, the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and the Royal Navy.  The title of the piece comically applies the name of a little girl's garment, a [[pinafore]], to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship.

''Pinafore'''s extraordinary popularity in Britain, America and elsewhere was followed by the similar success of a series of Gilbert and Sullivan works.  Their works, later known as the [[Savoy opera]]s, dominated the musical stage on both sides of the Atlantic for more than a decade and continue to be performed today.  The structure and style of these operas, particularly ''Pinafore'', were much copied and contributed significantly to the development of modern musical theatre.

==Background==
In 1875, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], who was then managing the [[Royalty Theatre]] for [[Selina Dolaro]], brought [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.<ref>Ainger, pp. 107<U+2013>08</ref>  This proved a success, and in 1876 [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] assembled a group of [[Equity partner|financial backers]] to establish the Comedy-Opera Company, which was devoted to the production and promotion of family-friendly English comic opera.<ref>Ainger, p. 130</ref>  With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length Gilbert and Sullivan opera.<ref>Ainger, pp. 110, 119<U+2013>20 and 130<U+2013>31; Jacobs, p. 109</ref>  This next opera was ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', which opened in November 1877.  It too was successful, running for 178&nbsp;performances.<ref name=Ainger157>Ainger, p. 157</ref>  Sheet music from the show sold well, and [[Organ grinder|street musicians]] played the melodies.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 113<U+2013>14</ref>  

Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor, as was usual in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatres, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support.  They were therefore able to choose their own cast of performers, rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre.  They chose talented actors, most of whom were not well-known stars and did not command high fees, and to whom they could teach a more [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] style of performance than was commonly used at the time.  They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers.<ref>Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133<U+2013>34</ref>  The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience; as critic [[Herman Klein]] wrote: "we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done.  For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings .... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight."<ref>Jacobs, p. 113</ref>

[[Image:Our New First Lord at Sea.png|thumb|250px|left|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon, 1877, portraying [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[William Henry Smith (politician)|W. H. Smith]] as a [[Glossary of nautical terms#L|land-lubber]], saying: "I think I'll now go below."  In ''Pinafore'', Sir Joseph similarly sings: "When the breezes blow / I generally go below".]]
The success of ''The Sorcerer'' paved the way for another collaboration by Gilbert and Sullivan.  Carte agreed on terms for a new opera with his Comedy-Opera Company partners, and Gilbert began work on ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' before the end of 1877.<ref>Ainger, p. 145</ref>  Gilbert's father had been a naval surgeon, and the nautical theme of the opera appealed to him.<ref name=Bradley115>Bradley (1996), p. 115</ref>  He drew on several of his earlier "[[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]]" poems (many of which also have nautical themes), including "Captain Reece" (1868) and "General John" (1867).<ref>Fitz-Gerald, p. 35</ref>  Some of the characters also have prototypes in the ballads: Dick Deadeye is based on a character in "Woman's Gratitude" (1869); an early version of Ralph Rackstaw can be seen in "Joe Go-Lightly" (1867), with its sailor madly in love with the daughter of someone who far outranks him; and Little Buttercup is taken almost wholesale from "The Bumboat Woman's Story" (1870).<ref name=Allenfn>Allen (1975), Introduction to chapter on ''Pinafore''</ref><ref name=Stedman161/>  On 27 December 1877, while Sullivan was on holiday on the [[French Riviera]], Gilbert sent him a plot sketch accompanied by the following note:<ref name=Jacobs114>Jacobs, pp. 114<U+2013>15</ref> 

{{quote|I have very little doubt whatever but that you will be pleased with it.  ... there is a good deal of fun in it which I haven't set down on paper.  Among other things a song (a kind of '[[Trial by Jury#Pattern for later Savoy operas|Judge's Song]]') for the First Lord <U+2013> tracing his career as office-boy ... clerk, traveller, junior partner and [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of Britain's Navy]] ....  Of course there will be no ''personality'' in this <U+2013> the fact that the First Lord in the Opera is a ''[[Radicals (UK)|Radical]]'' of the most pronounced type will do away with any suspicion that [[William Henry Smith (politician)|W.

Smith]] is intended.<ref name=Jacobs114/><ref>Gilbert's satire of politicians had led to censorship of Gilbert's plays before, for example ''[[The Happy Land]]'', Stedman, pp. 106<U+2013>10</ref>}}

Despite Gilbert's disclaimer, audiences, critics and even the [[Prime Minister]] identified Sir Joseph Porter with W. H. Smith (a politician who had recently been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty despite having neither military nor nautical experience).<ref>Jacobs, p. 115.  The Prime Minister, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], began to refer to his appointee as "Pinafore Smith".  See, e.g., Dark & Grey, p. 75; and Gary Dexter, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3561347/How-HMS-Pinafore-got-its-name.html "How ''HMS Pinafore'' got its name"], ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 1 October 2008</ref>  Sullivan was delighted with the sketch, and Gilbert read a first draft of the plot to Carte in mid-January.<ref>Stedman, p. 108</ref>

Following the example of his mentor, [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson]], Gilbert strove to ensure that the costumes and [[Theatrical scenery|sets]] were as realistic as possible.<ref>Stedman, pp. 129 and 155</ref>  When preparing the sets for ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', Gilbert and Sullivan visited [[Portsmouth]] in April 1878 to inspect ships.  Gilbert made sketches of [[HMS Victory|H.M.S. ''Victory'']] and [[HMS St Vincent (1815)|H.M.S. ''St Vincent'']] and created a model set for the carpenters to work from.<ref>Stedman, pp. 157<U+2013>58; Crowther, p. 90; Ainger, p. 154</ref>  This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, in which naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and in which most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged.<ref>Crowther, pp. 87<U+2013>89</ref>  This attention to detail was typical of Gilbert's [[Theatre director|stage management]] and would be repeated in all of his [[Savoy Opera]]s.<ref>Crowther, p. 90</ref>  Gilbert's focus on visual accuracy provided a "right-side-up for topysy-turvydom", that is, a realistic point of reference that serves to heighten the whimsicality and absurdity of the situations.<ref>Stedman, p. 155</ref>  Sullivan was "in the full swing" of work on the piece by the middle of April 1878.<ref>Jacobs, p. 117</ref>  The bright and cheerful music of ''Pinafore'' was composed during a time when Sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone.<ref>Ainger, p. 155</ref><ref>Bradley (1996), pp. 115<U+2013>16</ref>  The cast began music rehearsals on 24 April, and at the beginning of May 1878, the two collaborators worked closely together at Sullivan's flat to finalise the piece.<ref>Stedman, p. 159</ref><ref>Jacobs, p. 117<U+2013>18</ref>  

In ''Pinafore'', Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte used several of the principal cast members that they had assembled for ''The Sorcerer''.  As Gilbert had suggested to Sullivan in December 1877, "Mrs. Cripps [Little Buttercup] will be a capital part for [[Harriet Everard|Everard]] ....  [[Rutland Barrington|Barrington]] will be a capital captain, and [[George Grossmith|Grossmith]] a first-rate First Lord."<ref name=Jacobs114/>  However, Mrs. Howard Paul,<ref>Mrs. Paul, nee Isabella Featherstone (1833<U+2013>1879), had left her husband around 1877, as he was having an affair with the actress-dancer [[Letty Lind]], with whom he sired two children.  However, she continued performing under this name. See Cruickshank, Graeme. "The Life and Loves of Letty Lind" in ''The Gaiety'', Issue 22, Summer 2007</ref> who had played Lady Sangazure in ''The Sorcerer'', was declining vocally.  She was under contract to play the role of Cousin Hebe in ''Pinafore''.  Gilbert made an effort to write an amusing part for her despite Sullivan's reluctance to use her, but by mid-May 1878, both Gilbert and Sullivan wanted her out of the cast; unhappy with the role, she left.  With only a week to go before opening night, Carte hired concert singer [[Jessie Bond]] to play Cousin Hebe.<ref>Ainger, pp. 156<U+2013>57</ref><ref name=Stedman160>Stedman, p. 160</ref>  Since Bond had little experience as an actress, Gilbert and Sullivan cut the dialogue out of the role, except for a few lines in the last scene, which they turned into [[recitative]].<ref>The dialogue that was cut was based on lines from Gilbert's 1877 farce ''On Bail''; it would be revised again and used as part of ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' in 1881 (see Stedman, p. 160).</ref>  Other new cast members were [[Emma Howson]] and George Power in the romantic roles, who were improvements on the romantic [[soprano]] and [[tenor]] in ''The Sorcerer''.<ref name=Stedman161>Stedman, p. 161</ref>  

Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas.  He sought realism in acting, just as he strove for realistic visual elements.  He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity, but were coherent internal wholes.<ref>Cox-Ife, William.

As was to be his usual practice in his later operas, Sullivan left the [[overture]] for the last moment, sketching it out and entrusting it to the company's music director, in this case [[Alfred Cellier]], to complete.<ref name=Ainger157/>  ''Pinafore'' opened on 25 May 1878 at the [[Opera Comique]].

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
The British warship H.M.S. Pinafore is at anchor off [[Portsmouth]].  The sailors are on the [[Deck (ship)|quarterdeck]], proudly "cleaning brasswork, splicing rope, etc."

Little Buttercup, a Portsmouth "[[bumboat]] woman" (dockside vendor) &ndash; who is the "rosiest, roundest, and reddest beauty in all [[Spithead]]" &ndash; comes on board to sell her wares to the crew.  She hints that she may be hiding a dark secret under her "gay and frivolous exterior".  Ralph Rackstraw,<ref name=Raif/> "the smartest lad in all the fleet", enters, declaring his love for the Captain's daughter, Josephine. His fellow sailors (excepting Dick Deadeye, the grim and ugly realist of the crew) offer their sympathies, but they can give Ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned.

[[File:Pinafore1899.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Scene from 1886 [[Savoy Theatre]] [[souvenir programme]]]]
The gentlemanly and popular Captain greets his "gallant crew" and compliments them on their politeness, saying that he returns the favour by never ("well, hardly ever") using bad language, such as "a big, big D".<ref>"Big D meant "damn".  See Bradley (1996), p. 128.  In Act II, the Captain does use a big D, which shocks Sir Joseph and his female relatives.</ref>  After the sailors leave, the Captain confesses to Little Buttercup that Josephine is reluctant to consider a marriage proposal from Sir Joseph Porter, the First Lord of the Admiralty.  Buttercup says that she knows how it feels to love in vain. As she leaves, the Captain remarks that she is "a plump and pleasing person".  Josephine enters and reveals to her father that she loves a [[Able Seaman (rank)|humble sailor]] in his crew, but she assures him that she is a dutiful daughter and will never reveal her love to this sailor.

Sir Joseph comes on board, accompanied by his "admiring crowd of sisters, cousins and aunts".  He recounts how he rose from humble beginnings to be "ruler of the Queen's Navee" through persistence, although he has no naval qualifications.  He then delivers a humiliating lesson in etiquette, telling the Captain that he must always say "if you please" after giving an order; for "A British sailor is any man's equal" &ndash; excepting Sir Joseph's.  Sir Joseph has composed a song to illustrate that point, and he gives a copy of it to Ralph.  Shortly afterwards, elated by Sir Joseph's views on equality, Ralph decides that he will declare his love to Josephine.  This delights his shipmates, except Dick Deadeye, who contends that "when people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question".  Shocked by his words, the other sailors force Dick to listen to Sir Joseph's song before they exit, leaving Ralph alone on deck. Josephine now enters, and Ralph confesses his love in terms surprisingly eloquent for a "common sailor".  Josephine is touched, but although she has found Sir Joseph's attentions nauseating, she knows that it is her duty to marry Sir Joseph instead of Ralph. Disguising her true feelings, she "haughtily rejects" Ralph's "proffered love".

Ralph summons his shipmates (Sir Joseph's female relatives also arrive) and tells them that he is bent on suicide.  The crew expresses sympathy, except for Dick, who provides a stark counterpoint of dissent.  Ralph puts a pistol to his head, but as he is about to pull the trigger, Josephine enters, admitting that she loves him after all.  Ralph and Josephine plan to sneak ashore to elope that night.  Dick Deadeye warns them to "forbear, nor carry out the scheme", but the joyous ship's company ignores him.

===Act II===
Later that night, under a full moon, Captain Corcoran reviews his concerns: his "kindly crew rebels", his "daughter to a [[Jack Tar|tar]] is partial", his friends seem to desert him, and Sir Joseph has threatened a [[court-martial]]. Little Buttercup offers sympathy. He tells her that, if it were not for the difference in their social standing, he would have returned her affection. She prophesies that things are not all as they seem and that "a change" is in store for him, but he does not understand her cryptic warning.

[[Image:Pinafore Drawing.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Illustration of the characters in Act II by [[D. H. Friston]] from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 8 June 1878]]
Sir Joseph enters and complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him.  The Captain speculates that she is probably dazzled by his "exalted rank" and that if Sir Joseph can persuade her that "love levels all ranks", she will accept his proposal.  They withdraw, and Josephine enters, still feeling guilty about her planned elopement with Ralph and fearful of giving up a life of luxury.  When Sir Joseph makes the argument that "love levels all ranks", a delighted Josephine says that she "will hesitate no longer".  The Captain and Sir Joseph rejoice, but Josephine is now more determined than ever to marry Ralph.

Dick Deadeye intercepts the Captain and tells him of the lovers' plans to elope. The Captain confronts Ralph and Josephine as they try to leave the ship. The pair declare their love, justifying their actions because "He is an Englishman!"  The furious Captain is unmoved and blurts out, "Why, damme, it's too bad!" Sir Joseph and his relatives, who have overheard this oath, are shocked to hear swearing on board a ship, and Sir Joseph orders the Captain confined to his cabin.

When Sir Joseph asks what had provoked the usually polite officer's outburst, Ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for Josephine.  Furious in his turn at this revelation, and ignoring Josephine's plea to spare Ralph, Sir Joseph has the sailor "loaded with chains" and taken to the ship's dungeon.  Little Buttercup now comes forward to reveal her long-held secret.  Many years ago, when she was a young [[nursemaid]], she had cared for two babies, one "of low condition", the other "a regular [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]".  She confesses that she "mixed those children up ....  The wellborn babe was Ralph; your Captain was the other."

Sir Joseph now realises that Ralph should have been the Captain, and the Captain should have been Ralph.  He summons both, and they emerge wearing one another's uniforms: Ralph as Captain, in command of the ''Pinafore'', and Corcoran as a common sailor. Sir Joseph's marriage with Josephine is now "out of the question" in his eyes: "love levels all ranks ... to a considerable extent, but it does not level them as much as that."  He hands her to Captain Rackstraw.  The former Captain's now-humble social rank leaves him free to marry Buttercup.  Sir Joseph settles for his cousin Hebe, and all ends in general rejoicing.

==Productions==
''Pinafore'' opened on 25 May 1878 at the [[Opera Comique]], before an enthusiastic audience, with Sullivan conducting.<ref>Ainger, pp. 157<U+2013>58</ref><ref>After opening night, the company's musical director, Alfred Cellier, conducted most of the performances.  [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Goossens, p<U+00E8>re|Eug<U+00E8>ne Goossens]] conducted the piece in late July and August 1878, while Cellier was assisting Sullivan at the promenade concerts at Covent Garden.

[[Image:Pinaforeplaybill.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Poster illustration from original 1878 production]]
In late August 1878, Sullivan used some of the ''Pinafore'' music, arranged by his assistant [[Hamilton Clarke]], during several successful promenade concerts at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] that generated interest and stimulated ticket sales.<ref>Ainger, p. 162</ref>  By September, ''Pinafore'' was playing to full houses at the Opera Comique.  The piano score sold 10,000&nbsp;copies,<ref>Jones, p. 6</ref> and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces.<ref>Stedman, p. 163</ref>  Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be profitable, and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from the directors of the Comedy-Opera Company.  The Opera Comique was required to close at Christmas 1878 for repairs to drainage and sewage under the Public Health Act of 1875.  Carte used the enforced closure of the theatre to invoke a contract clause reverting the rights of ''Pinafore'' and ''Sorcerer'' to Gilbert and Sullivan after the initial run of ''H.M.S. Pinafore''.<ref>Ainger, pp. 165<U+2013>67</ref>  Carte then took a six-month personal lease on the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879.<ref name=Stedman170>Stedman, p. 170</ref>

Meanwhile, numerous pirated versions of ''Pinafore'' began playing in America with great success, beginning with a production in [[Boston]] that opened on 25 November 1878.<ref name=Bradley116/>  Pinafore became a source of popular quotations on both sides of the Atlantic, such as the exchange:
:"What, never?"  
:"No, never!"
:"What, ''never?''"
:"Well, hardly ever!"<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/lawrence/lawrence_3.html Lawrence, Arthur H. "An illustrated interview with Sir Arthur Sullivan"] Part 3, from ''The Strand Magazine'', Vol. xiv, No.84 (December 1897), accessed 10 March 2009</ref><ref>Ainger, p. 166</ref>

In February 1879, ''Pinafore'' resumed operations at the Opera Comique.<ref>Stedman, p. 165</ref>  The opera also resumed touring in April, with two companies crisscrossing the British provinces by June, one starring [[Richard Mansfield]] as Sir Joseph, the other [[W. S. Penley]] in the role.  Hoping to join in on the profits to be made in America from ''Pinafore'', Carte left in June for New York to make arrangements for an "authentic" production there to be rehearsed personally by the author and composer.  He arranged to rent a theatre and auditioned chorus members for the American production of ''Pinafore'' and a new Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be premiered in New York, and for tours of ''Pinafore'' and ''Sorcerer''.<ref>Ainger, pp. 168<U+2013>69</ref><ref name=Stedman170/> 

[[File:PinFirstNightProg.jpg|right|thumb|Opening night programme cover]]
Sullivan, as had been arranged with Carte and Gilbert, gave notice to the partners of the Comedy-Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing the contract to produce ''Pinafore'' with them and that he would be withdrawing his music on 31 July.<ref name=Ainger169>Ainger, p. 169</ref><ref>Jacobs, p. 126</ref>  In return, the disgruntled partners gave notice that they intended to play ''Pinafore'' at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company.  They offered the London and touring casts of ''Pinafore'' more money to play in their production, and although some choristers accepted their offer, only one principal player, Mr Dymott, accepted.<ref name=Rollins6/>  They engaged the [[Imperial Theatre, London|Imperial Theatre]] but had no scenery.

===Taking ''Pinafore'' to the United States===
Approximately 150&nbsp;unauthorised productions of ''Pinafore'' sprang up in the [[United States]] in 1878 and 1879, and none of these paid royalties to the authors.<ref name=Prestige>Prestige, Colin. "D'Oyly Carte and the Pirates: The Original New York Productions of Gilbert and Sullivan", pp. 113<U+2013>48 at p. 118, ''Gilbert and Sullivan Papers Presented at the International Conference held at the [[University of Kansas]] in May 1970'', Edited by James Helyar. Lawrence, Kansas: University of Kansas Libraries, 1971.</ref><ref>Jones, p. 7</ref><ref>Allen (1979), p. 2</ref>  The first of these, opening at the Boston Museum on 25 November 1878, made such a splash that the piece was quickly produced in major cities and on tour by dozens of companies throughout the country.  Boston alone saw at least a dozen productions, including a juvenile version described by [[Louisa May Alcott]] in her 1879 story, "Jimmy's Cruise in the Pinafore".<ref name=Boston>Kanthor, Harold.  "H.M.S. Pinafore and the Theater Season in Boston 1878<U+2013>1879", ''[[Journal of Popular Culture]], Spring 1991, vol. 24, no. 4, Platinum Periodicals, p. 119</ref>  In New York, the piece played simultaneously in eight theatres within five blocks of each other.  These pirated performances took many forms, including [[burlesque (genre)|burlesque]]s, productions with men playing women's roles and vice-versa, spoofs, variety acts, [[Minstrel show]] versions,<ref name=Boston/> all-black and Catholic productions, German, [[Yiddish]] and other foreign-language versions,<ref name=Jones7>Jones, p. 7</ref> performances on boats or by church choirs,<ref name=Stedman169>Stedman, p. 169</ref> and productions starring casts of children.<ref name=Bradley116/><ref name=Boston/>  Sheet music arrangements were popular, there were ''Pinafore''-themed dolls and household items, and references to the opera were common in advertising, news and other media.<ref name=Jones7/>  Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte brought lawsuits in the U.S. and tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, or at least to claim some royalties, without success.  They made a special effort to claim American rights for their next work after ''Pinafore'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', by giving the official premiere in New York.<ref>Rosen, Zvi S.

[[Image:HMSPinafore2.png|thumb|left|Advertisement for a (probably unlicensed) American production of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'']]
Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of ''Pinafore'' in America.<ref>Ainger, p. 168</ref>  Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager [[John T. Ford]]<ref>Ford had been one of the few managers who had paid Gilbert and Sullivan any kind of fee for performing ''Pinafore'' in America, and his reward for a small gesture was great (Stedman, p. 169).</ref> to present, at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]], the first authorised American production of ''Pinafore''.<ref name=Ainger169/>  In November, he returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including [[J. H. Ryley]] as Sir Joseph, [[Blanche Roosevelt]] as Josephine, [[Alice Barnett]] as Little Buttercup, [[Furneaux Cook]] as Dick Deadeye, [[Hugh Talbot]] as Ralph Rackstraw and [[Jessie Bond]] as Cousin Hebe.<ref name=Jacobs129>Jacobs, p. 129</ref>  To these, he added some American singers, including [[Signor Brocolini]] as Captain Corcoran.<ref name=Ainger182>Ainger, pp. 182<U+2013>83</ref>  [[Alfred Cellier]] came to assist Sullivan, while his brother [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Cellier|Fran<U+00E7>ois]] remained in London to conduct ''Pinafore'' there.<ref>Jacobs, p. 127</ref>  

''Pinafore'' opened in New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage in the chorus) and ran for the rest of December. After a reasonably strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of ''Pinafore''.<ref>Stedman, p. 174</ref> This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, ''The Pirates of Penzance'', which premi<U+00E8>red with much success on 31 December.<ref name=Jacobs129/> Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing ''Pinafore'' alongside ''The Sorcerer'' and ''Pirates''.<ref name=Ainger182/><ref name=Stedman175>Stedman, p. 175</ref> 

===Children's production===
[[Image:Grattanpin.jpg|thumb|1880 programme for Carte's ''Children's Pinafore'']]

The unauthorised juvenile productions of ''Pinafore'' were so popular that Carte mounted his own children's version, played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879.<ref>Kanthor, Hal.

Carte's children's production earned an enthusiastic review from critic [[Clement Scott]]<ref>Scott, Clement. [http://savoyoperas.org.uk/pinafore/childpin.html "Our Play-Box. ''The Children's Pinafore''",] ''The Theatre'', 1 January 1880, new [3rd.] series 1: pp. 38<U+2013>39, accessed 10 March 2009</ref> and the other London critics, as well as the audiences, including children.<ref name=Stedman175/>  However, Captain Corcoran's curse "Damme!" was uncensored, shocking such prominent audience members as [[Lewis Carroll]], who later wrote: "a bevy of sweet innocent-looking girls sing, with bright and happy looks, the chorus 'He said, Damn me! He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning ....  How Mr. Gilbert could have stooped to write, or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand".<ref>Carroll, Lewis.

===Subsequent productions===

After the opera became successful in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces.  At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes as many as three, played ''Pinafore'' under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887.  The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again for most of the time between 1903 and 1940.<ref>Rollins and Witts, pp. 7<U+2013>164</ref>  Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962.  It continued to hew closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's plot books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.<ref>Bradley (2005), p. 27</ref>

[[Image:Pin15 1.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ruth Vincent]] as Josephine in 1899]] 
Until 1908, revivals of the opera were given in contemporary dress.<ref name=rw>Rollins and Witts, Appendix p. VII</ref>  After that, designers such as [[Percy Anderson]], [[George Sheringham]] and [[Peter Goffin]] created Victorian costume designs.<ref name=rw/><ref>Mander, pp. 102<U+2013>105</ref>  In the winter of 1940&ndash;41, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s scenery and costumes for ''Pinafore'' and three other operas were destroyed by German bombs during [[World War II]].<ref>Rollins and Witts, p. 165</ref>  The opera was revived in London in the summer of 1947.<ref>Rollins and Witts, pp. 165<U+2013>72</ref>  It was then included in the D'Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then on, until the company's closure in 1982.<ref>Rollins and Witts, pp. 172<U+2013>86, and supplements</ref>  The D'Oyly Carte company performed ''Pinafore'' before [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and the royal family at [[Windsor Castle]] on 16 June 1977, the first [[Royal Command Performance|royal command performance]] of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera since 1891.<ref name=Bradley116/>  

The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not allow any other professional company to present the Savoy operas in Britain until the copyrights expired at the end of 1961, although it licensed many amateur and school societies to do so, beginning in the 19th century.<ref name=copyright>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gondoliers/html/67docprod.html "The 1968 D'Oyly Carte Opera Company Production of ''The Gondoliers''"], reprinted from theatre programme of 29 January 1968, ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', Retrieved on 11 March 2009</ref>  After 1961, other professional companies mounted productions of the opera in Britain.

==Reception==
===Initial critical reception===
The early reviews were mostly favourable.<ref name=Allenfn/><ref name=Stedman161/>  ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' wrote: 
{{quote|Seldom indeed have we been in the company of a more joyous audience ....  [Gilbert and Sullivan] have on previous occasions been productive of such legitimate amusement, such novel forms of drollery, such original wit, and unexpected whimsicality, that nothing was more natural than for the audience to anticipate an evening of thorough enjoyment. The expectation was fulfilled completely. Those who believed in the power of Mr Gilbert to tickle the fancy with quaint suggestions and unexpected forms of humour were more than satisfied, and those who appreciate Mr Arthur Sullivan's inexhaustible gift of melody were equally gratified; while that large class of playgoers who are pleased with brilliant dresses and charming stage effects declared themselves delighted. The result, therefore, was "a hit, a palpable hit" ... there were some slight drawbacks [such] as the severe cold that affected Mr. Rutland Barrington [the captain], and almost prevented his singing.}}  

''The Era'' also lavishly praised Emma Howson as Josephine.<ref>"Opera Comique", ''The Era'', 2 June 1878, Country Edition, 40(2071): p. 5, cols. 1<U+2013>2</ref>  ''The Entr'acte and Limelight'' commented that the opera was reminiscent of ''Trial by Jury'' and ''Sorcerer'' but found it diverting and called the music "very charming. To hear so-called grand opera imitated through the medium of the most trifling lyrics, is funny".<ref name=Limelight>"London Theatres. Opera Comique", ''The Entr'acte and Limelight: Theatrical and Musical Critic and Advertiser'', 1 June 1878, 466: p. 12</ref><ref name=Trovatore>''Pinafore'' parodies the baby-switching plot device in ''[[Il Trovatore]]''.  See, e.g., Gurewitsch, Matthew.

H. Smith]].  It opined, further, that "He Is an Englishman" is "an excellent satire on the proposition that a man must necessarily be virtuous to be English".  It found the piece, as a whole, well presented and predicted that it would have a long run.<ref name=Limelight/> 

[[File:Punch - Sullivan's knighthood.png|right|thumb|''Punch'' cartoon mocking Sullivan for his focus on comic opera]]
Similarly, ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' concluded that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert's "caustic humour and quaint satire".  It found that there was "much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits ....  Dr. Sullivan's music is as lively as the text to which it is set, with here and there a touch of sentimental expression ....  The piece is well performed throughout."<ref>"Opera Comique", ''The Illustrated London News'', 1 June 1878, 72(2031): 515</ref>  The ''[[Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', ''The Globe'', ''[[The Times]]'' (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and ''[[Evening Standard|The Standard]]'' concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, "adds to the reality of the illusion".<ref name=Allenfn/>  ''The Times'' also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a "national musical stage" with a libretto free from risqu<U+00E9> French "improprieties" and without the "aid" of Italian and German musical models.<ref name=Timesrev>''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6</ref>

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and the ''[[Athenaeum (magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', however, greeted the opera with only mixed praise.<ref name=Walbrook>Walbrook, chapter V</ref><ref name=Stedman161/>  ''[[The Musical Times]]'' complained that the ongoing collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan was "detrimental to the art-progress of either" because, although it was popular with audiences, "something higher is demanded for what is understood as 'comic opera'".  The paper commented that Sullivan was gifted with "the true elements of an artist, which would be successfully developed were a carefully framed libretto presented to him for composition".  It concluded, however, by saying how much it enjoyed the opera: "Having thus conscientiously discharged our duties as art-critics, let us at once proceed to say that ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' is an amusing piece of extravagance, and that the music floats it on merrily to the end".<ref>"Opera-Comique", ''The Musical Times'', 1 June 1878, 19(424): 329</ref>  ''The Times'' and several of the other papers agreed that, while the piece was entertaining, Sullivan was capable of higher art.  Only ''The Figaro'' was actively hostile to the new piece.<ref name=Allenfn/>  Upon the publication of the vocal score, a review by ''The Academy'' joined the chorus of regret that Sullivan had sunk so low as to compose music for ''Pinafore'' and hoped that he would turn to projects "more worthy of his great ability".<ref>''The Academy'', 13 July 1878, new series 14(323): p. 49, col. 3</ref>  This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career.<ref>Baily, p. 250</ref>

The many unauthorised American productions of 1878<U+2013>79 were of widely varying quality, and many of them were adaptations of the opera.  One of the more "authentic" ones was the production by the Boston Ideal Opera Company, which was first formed to produce ''Pinafore''.  It engaged well-regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3,000-seat Boston Theatre.  The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an "ideal" production.  The ''Boston Journal'' reported that the audience was "wrought up by the entertainment to a point of absolute approval".  The paper observed that it is a mistake to consider ''Pinafore'' a burlesque, "for while irresistibly comical it is not ''bouffe'' and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost".<ref name=Boston/>  The ''Journal'' described the opera as "classical" in method and wrote that its "most exquisite satire" lay in its "imitation of the absurdities" of grand opera.  The company went on to become one of the most successful touring companies in America.<ref name=Boston/>  The first children's version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences, extending its run through the summer of 1879.  The ''[[Boston Herald]]'' wrote that the "the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delight ... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard".<ref name=Boston/>

===Subsequent reception===
When ''Pinafore'' was first revived in London in 1887, it was already treated as a classic.  ''The Illustrated London News'' observed that the opera had not been updated with new dialogue, jokes and songs, but concluded that this for the best, as the public would have missed the "time-honoured jokes, such as 'Hardly Ever.'  The Savoy has once more got a brilliant success."<ref>"The Playhouses", ''The Illustrated London News'', 19 November 1887, 91(2535): 580, col. 1</ref>  ''The Theatre'' concurred, stating that since the opera "has been heard in almost every part of this habitable globe and been enjoyed everywhere, there is not much occasion to descant".  It called the revival a "most brilliant" success and predicted another long run.<ref>"Our Omnibus-Box", ''The Theatre'', New Series, 1 December 1887, 10: 337</ref>  

[[Image:BarringtonCaptain.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rutland Barrington]] as Captain Corcoran in the first London revival, 1887]]
Reviewing the 1899 revival, ''[[Athenaeum (magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' managed to praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment's critique of Sullivan.  On the one hand, "The ''Pinafore'' ... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious <U+2013> very serious <U+2013> and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character ... it is delicately scored, and in many ways displays ability of a high order".  On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his [[Symphony in E, Irish|symphony]], "he would have produced still higher results; in like manner ''Pinafore'' set us wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts".<ref>''The Athen<U+00E6>um'', 10 June 1899, 3737: 730<U+2013>731</ref>

In 1911, [[H. L. Mencken]] wrote: "No other comic opera ever written <U+2013> no other stage play, indeed, of any sort <U+2013> was ever so popular ....  ''Pinafore'' ... has been given, and with great success, wherever there are theaters <U+2013> from Moscow to [[Buenos Aires]], from [[Cape Town]] to [[Shanghai]]; in [[Madrid]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Melbourne]]; even in Paris, Rome, [[Vienna]] and [[Berlin]]."<ref>Mencken, H. L.

''The Times'' gave the company's 1920 London production an enthusiastic review, saying that the audience was "enraptured", and regretting that ''Pinafore'' would be played for only two weeks.  It praised the cast, singling out [[Leo Sheffield]] as the Captain, [[Henry Lytton]] as Sir Joseph, [[Elsie Griffin]] as Josephine, James Hay as Ralph, [[Bertha Lewis]] as Little Buttercup and the "splendid" choral tone.  It concluded that the opera made a "rollicking climax to the season".<ref>"''H.M.S. Pinafore''. Revival at [[Princes Theatre]], ''The Times'', 21 January 1920, p. 10</ref>  Two years later, it gave an even more glowing report of that season's performances, calling [[Derek Oldham]] an "ideal hero" as Ralph, noting that [[Sydney Granville]] "fairly brought down the house" with his song, that [[Darrell Fancourt]]'s Deadeye was "an admirably sustained piece of caricature" and that it was a "great pleasure" to hear the returning principals.<ref>"''H.M.S.

In 1879, [[J. C. Williamson]] acquired the exclusive performing rights to ''Pinafore'' in Australia and New Zealand.  His first production earned public and critical acclaim.  Williamson played Sir Joseph, and his wife, [[Maggie Moore]] played Josephine.  Praising the production and all the performers, the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' noted that the production though "abounding in fun" was dignified and precise, that many numbers were encored and that laughter and applause from the "immense audience ... was liberally bestowed".<ref>''Sydney Morning Herald'', 17 November 1879</ref>  Williamson's company continued to produce ''Pinafore'' in Australia, New Zealand and on tour into the 1960s with much success.  As Williamson said, "If you need money, then put on G&S".<ref>Bradley (2005), p. 73</ref>  Meanwhile, ''Pinafore'' continued to garner praise outside of Britain.  The 1950s Danish version in Copenhagen, for example, was revived repeatedly, playing for well over 100&nbsp;performances to "packed houses".<ref>"H.M.S. Pinafore Again Delights the Danes", ''The Times'', 16 October 1959, p. 16</ref>  Translations into German, Yiddish and many other languages, and professional productions in places as remote as [[Samarkand]] in Uzbekistan have been successful.<ref name=Brad4>Bradley (2005), Chapter 4, describing numerous productions beginning with 1962.</ref>

In the U.S., where Gilbert and Sullivan's performance copyright was never in force,<ref>"A New Approach to ''H.M.S. Pinafore''", ''The Times'', 9 March 1960, p. 13</ref> ''Pinafore'' continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies.  ''The New York Times'', in a 1914 review, called a large-scale production at the 6,000-seat [[New York Hippodrome]] a "royal entertainment" that "comes up smiling".  The opera had been turned into a "mammoth spectacle" at with a chorus of hundreds and the famous Hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour.  Buttercup made her entrance to the three-masted Pinafore rowing into sight, and Dick Deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash.  The ''Times'' praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs "fairly to be shouted".  The production took some liberties, including interpolating music from other Sullivan works.  The paper concluded, "the mild satire of ''Pinafore'' is entertaining because it is universal".<ref>"''H.M.S. Pinafore'' a la Hippodrome; They Sail the Ocean Tank and Their Saucy Ship's a Beauty", ''The New York Times'', 10 April 1914, p. 13</ref>  The same paper deemed [[Winthrop Ames]]' popular Broadway productions of ''Pinafore'' in the 1920s and 1930s "spectacular".<ref>[[Brooks Atkinson|Atkinson, J. Brooks]], "G. & S., Incorporated", ''The New York Times'', 25 April 1926, p. X1</ref>  Modern productions in America continue to be generally well received.  ''The New York Times'' review of [[The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players]]' 2008 season at [[New York City Center]] commented, "Gilbert's themes of class inequality, overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant, however absurdly treated.  But the lasting appeal of ''Pinafore'' and its ilk is more a matter of his unmatched linguistic genius and Sullivan<U+2019>s generous supply of addictive melodies.<ref>Smith, Steve.

With the expiry of the copyrights, companies around the world have free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years.  Productions of ''Pinafore'', both amateur and professional, range from the traditional, in the D'Oyly Carte vein, to the broadly adapted, such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment (formed by [[Simon Gallaher]]) in Australia and [[Opera della Luna]] in Britain.<ref name=Brad4/>  Since its original production, ''H.M.S.

==Analysis==
Theatre historian John Bush Jones wrote that ''Pinafore'' has "everything a musical theatregoer could ask for.  An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well-drawn characters who speak and sing witty, literate, and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [and] has a score that ... has plenty of tunes for the audience to go away humming".<ref name=Jones8>Jones, p. 8</ref>  Sir George Power, the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw, opined in later life that the secret of the success of the Savoy operas is the way in which "Sullivan entered into the spirit of Gilbert's topsy-turvy humour, and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly, or, when Gilbert's satire was keenest and most acid, consciously wallowed in sentiment."<ref>"The Original Rackstraw", ''The Era'', 18 July 1908, p. 15</ref>  Another commentator has suggested that the opera's enduring success lies in its focus on "mirth and silliness".<ref>[http://deseretnews.com/article/content/mobile/1,5620,635159512,00.html?printView=true "''Pinafore'' focuses on mirth and silliness",] ''Deseret News'', 10 November 2005, accessed 10 March 2009</ref>  Even the title of the piece is silly, applying the name of a little girl's garment, a [[pinafore]], to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship, which usually had names like [[HMS Victory|Victory]], [[HMS Goliath|Goliath]], [[HMS Audacious|Audacious]] and [[HMS Minotaur|Minotaur]].<ref>Benford, Harry.

===Satiric and comic themes===
Biographer Jane Stedman wrote that ''Pinafore'' is "satirically far more complex" than ''The Sorcerer''.  She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads, including the idea of gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from "Captain Reece" (1868) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from "General John" (1867).  Dick Deadeye, based on a character in "Woman's Gratitude" (1869), represents another of Gilbert's favorite (and semi-autobiographical) satiric themes: the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding "face and form" makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense.<ref>Crowther, Andrew. [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ajcrowth/hunchback.htm "Hunchbacks, Misanthropes and Outsiders: Gilbert's Self-Image",] ''Gilbert and Sullivan Boys and Girls'' (GASBAG) no. 206 (Winter 1998)</ref><ref name=Stedman161/>  Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera, ''[[The Gentleman in Black]]'' which includes the device of baby-switching.<ref>Ainger, p. 83</ref> 

[[Image:PinaforeCups1.jpg|right|thumb|Souvenir programme cover from 1878 during the run of the original production]]
Historian H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921 that ''Pinafore'' "satirizes the type of nautical drama of which [[Douglas Jerrold]]'s ''[[Black-Eyed Susan]]'' is a typical instance, and the 'God's Englishman' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude, striking an attitude, and doing little or nothing to help one's country".<ref name=Walbrook/>  In 2005, Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera, saying, "they all sing 'He is an Englishman', and you know damn well they're sending it up, but the music is so military ... that you can't help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire."<ref name=MusicShow>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/musicshow/stories/2005/1378819.htm Interview of Stuart Maunder, ] ''The Music Show'', [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Radio National, Australia, 14 May 2005, accessed 10 March 2009</ref>  In addition, he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera: "''H.M.S. Pinafore'' is basically a satire on ... the British love of the class system ....  [A]t this moment, all of the men on board say, 'But of course [Ralph] can marry [the Captain's] daughter, because he's British, and therefore he's great'".<ref name=MusicShow/><ref>Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor's "patriotism guarantees his virtue".  Jacobs, p. 118</ref><ref>Crowther makes a point similar to Maunder's: "[T]hough Gilbert intended [the song] as a devastating parody of patriotic songs, the fervour of Sullivan's music often leads people to believe it a sincerely-meant patriotic song; and as the words and music pull the song in opposite directions the listener is left in a curiously ambiguous position, moved and amused simultaneously." Crowther, Andrew. "The Land Where Contradictions Meet", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 2, no. 11, p. 330, Autumn 2000</ref>

One of Gilbert's favourite comic themes is the elevation of an unqualified person to a position of high responsibility.  In ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873), for example, Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position.  In particular, the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty.<ref>Stedman, pp. 106<U+2013>10</ref><ref>Lawrence, pp. 166<U+2013>67</ref>  In ''Pinafore'', Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph, who rises to the same position by "never go[ing] to sea".<ref>Fischler, Alan. ''Modified Rapture: comedy in W. S. Gilbert's Savoy operas'', pp. 91<U+2013>92, Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1991</ref><ref name=Walbrook/>  In the later Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the characters Major-General Stanley, in ''Pirates'', and Ko-Ko in ''[[The Mikado]]'' are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications.  Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics, implying that when Sir Joseph "always voted at [his] party's call", he sacrificed his personal integrity.<ref>Lawrence, p. 181</ref>  The "commercial middle class" (which was Gilbert's main audience) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed.<ref name=T1929>"Savoy Theatre: The Sullivan Opera Season, ''H.M.S. Pinafore''", ''The Times'', 10 December 1929, p. 14</ref>  In addition, the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain, even though they were babies nursed together, satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]''.<ref name=Stedman160/>  ''The Times'' wrote, in reviewing the 1929 production, that ''Pinafore'' was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a "paternal" Captain and the "ethics ... of all romanticism" are accepted "unflinchingly" and taken to their logical conclusion: "It is the reference to actuality that is essential; without it, the absurdity will not stand starkly out".<ref name=T1929/>

[[Image:A British Tar.jpg|thumb|left|Gilbert's Illustration of "A British [[Jack Tar|tar]]" (1906)]]
A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks.  In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera, ''The Sorcerer'', a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different [[social class]]es.<ref>Lawrence, pp. 180<U+2013>81</ref>  In ''Pinafore'', the captain's daughter, Josephine, loves and is loved by a common sailor, but she dutifully tells him, "your proffered love I haughtily reject".  He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with "I am a British sailor, and I love you".  It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she.  This is a parody of the Victorian "equality" drama, such as [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s ''The Lady of Lyons'' (1838), where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech, ending with "I am a peasant!"<ref name=Stedman162>Stedman, p. 162</ref>  It then turns out that he has become her social superior.  Furthermore, in ''Pinafore'', Sir Joseph assures Josephine that "love levels all ranks".  In [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''The Serf'', the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank, and she declares happily at the end that "love levels all".<ref name=Stedman162/>  In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical [[melodrama]], Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are "any man's equal" (excepting his), and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor.  Conversely, he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him "dance a hornpipe on the cabin table".<ref name=Stedman162/>  Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine "becomes acceptable only through the absurd second-act revelation of Buttercup's inadvertent switching of the infants" and concludes that Gilbert is a "conservative satirist [who] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo ... [and] set out to show [that] love definitely ''does not'' level all ranks".<ref name=Jones8/>     

There is a divide among Gilbert and Sullivan scholars as to whether Gilbert is, as Jones argues, a supporter of the status quo whose focus is merely to entertain or, on the other hand, predominantly to satirise and protest "against the follies of his age".<ref name=Land>Crowther, Andrew. "The Land Where Contradictions Meet", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', vol. 2, no. 11, pp. 325<U+2013>31, Autumn 2000 (discussing the views of various scholars).</ref>  Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther posits that this disagreement arises from Gilbert's "techniques of inversion <U+2013> with irony and topsyturvydom", which lead to "the surface meaning of his writings" being "the opposite of their underlying meaning".  Crowther argues that Gilbert desires to "celebrate" society's norms while, at the same time, satirising these conventions.  In ''Pinafore'', which established many patterns for the later Savoy operas, Gilbert found a way to express his own conflict that "also had tremendous appeal to the general public".<ref name=Land/>  He creates "a highly intelligent parody of nautical melodrama ... [though] controlled by the conventions it mocks".<ref name=Land/> While nautical melodrama exalts the common sailor, in ''Pinafore'' Gilbert makes the proponent of equality, Sir Joseph, a pompous and misguided member of the ruling class who, hypocritically, cannot apply the idea of equality to himself.<ref>Crowther notes that Alexis in ''The Sorcerer'' is also such a "misguided superior".  See also Stedman, p. 162</ref>  The hero, Ralph, is convinced of his equality by Sir Joseph's foolish pronouncements and declares his love for his Captain's daughter, throwing over the accepted "fabric of social order".  At this point, Crowther suggests, the logic of Gilbert's satiric argument should result in Ralph's arrest.  But to satisfy convention, Gilbert creates an obvious absurdity: the captain and Ralph were switched as babies.  By an "accident of birth", Ralph is suddenly an appropriate husband for Josephine, and both the social order and the desire for a romantic happy ending are satisfied at once.<ref>See also Jones, p. 8</ref>  Crowther concludes, "We have an opera which uses all the conventions of melodrama and ridicules them; but in the end it is difficult to see which has won out, the conventions or the ridicule."  Thus, ''Pinafore'' found broadbased success by appealing to the intellectual theatregoer seeking satire, the middle-class theatre-goer looking for a comfortable confirmation of the "existing social order" and the working-class audience who saw a satisfying melodramatic victory for the common man.<ref name=Land/>

===Songs and musical analysis===
[[Image:Circa-1879-DOyly-Carte-HMS-Pinafore-from-Library-of-Congress2.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre poster for an American production, c.&nbsp;1879]]
According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs, Gilbert's plot "admirably sparked off Sullivan's genius".<ref name=Jacobs118>Jacobs, p. 118</ref>  Sullivan embraces the nautical setting; in "We Sail the Ocean Blue", for example, he "presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty".<ref name=BBCGuide/>  In the Captain's opening song, "I am the Captain of the Pinafore", he admits that his gentlemanliness "never ... well, hardly ever" gives way to swearing at his men, and although he has experience at sea, he "hardly ever" suffers from seasickness.<ref name=BBCGuide>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A620993 "'HMS Pinafore' - the Comic Opera",] Edited Guide Entry from ''The Lives and Works of Gilbert and Sullivan'', BBC h2g2, 24 August 2001, accessed 10 March 2009</ref>  Sullivan "unerringly found the right musical setting for the key phrase 'What never?' ... cunningly sharpened ... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon."<ref name=Jacobs119>Jacobs, p. 119</ref>  Audrey Williamson argued that the music of ''Pinafore'' is quintessentially English and free of European influences throughout most of the score, from the "glee" for Ralph, the Boatswain and the Carpenter, to "For He Is an Englishman".<ref>Williamson, p. 63</ref>

The best-known songs from the opera<ref>Shepherd, Marc.

[http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/miscompo.htm List of compilation discs of Gilbert and Sullivan Songs by other producers] at ''A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', 7 November 2001, accessed 10 March 2009</ref> include "I'm called Little Buttercup", a [[waltz]] tune introducing the character, which Sullivan repeats in the entr'acte and in the Act II finale to imprint the melody on the mind of the audience;<ref>Jacobs, p. 119.  Gilbert had introduced this character in his 1870 Bab Ballad "The Bumboat Woman's Story".</ref> and "A British tar" (a [[glee (music)|glee]] for three men describing the ideal sailor), composed by Sir Joseph "to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man's equal, excepting mine".<ref name=Jacobs118/>  Sullivan's voicing advances the satiric lyric, which mocks the "equality" plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph.<ref name=Land/>  Another popular number is Sir Joseph's song "When I was a Lad", recounting the meteoric rise of his career, which bears similarities to that of [[William Henry Smith (politician)|W. H. Smith]], the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] in 1877).<ref name=Walbrook/> 

In ''Pinafore'', Sullivan exploits minor keys for comic effect, for instance in "Kind Captain, I've important information".<ref>Hughes, p. 53</ref>  Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in "Sorry her lot".<ref>Hughes, p. 55</ref>  Biographer Gervase Hughes was impressed with the introduction to the opening chorus which includes "a rousing nautical tune ... in a key of no nonsense, C major ... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of "Sorry her lot" in 2/4 [time].  After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup ... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz."  He continues, "the bassoon and basses ... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore ... in the improbable key of A flat minor .... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed.  So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6/4".<ref>Hughes, p. 133</ref>

According to Jacobs, "Ralph, Captain Corcoran, Sir Joseph and Josephine all live in their interactive music (particularly 'Never mind the why and wherefore'), and almost as much musical resource is lavished on two characters parodied from opera or melodrama, Little Buttercup with 'gypsy blood in her veins' and the heavy-treading Dick Deadeye."<ref>Jacobs, ''quoted'' in Holden, p. 1060</ref> Jacobs also opined that the [[Leading-tone|leading tone]] that begins "Never mind the why and wherefore" "serves to emphasize the phrase like a [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss-ian]] grace-note".<ref name=Jacobs118/>  Sullivan scholar [[David Russell Hulme]] noted Sullivan's parody of operatic styles, "particularly the [[Handel]]ian recitatives and the elopement scene (evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies), but best of all is the travesty of the patriotic tune in 'For he is an Englishman!'"<ref>Hulme, ''quoted'' in Sadie, vol. 2, p. 727</ref>  Buttercup's Act II song, in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby-switching is preceded by a quote from [[Franz Schubert]]'s "[[Der Erlk<U+00F6>nig|The Erl-King]]" and also parodies the opera ''[[Il Trovatore]]''.<ref name=Trovatore/>  Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in "[[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]an recitative".  But on the serious side, he enhances the moments of true emotional climax, as in Josephine's Act II aria, and added musical interest to concerted numbers by "subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings."<ref name=Jacobs119/>

==Versions and cut material==
===Ballad for Captain Corcoran, "Reflect, my child"===
During rehearsals for the original production, Gilbert added a ballad for Captain Corcoran in which he urged his daughter to forget the common sailor with whom she is in love, because "at every step, he would commit solecisms that society would never pardon." The ballad was meant to be sung between No. 5 and No. 6 of the current score, but it was cut before opening night. The words survive in the libretto that was deposited with the [[Lord Chamberlain]] for licensing. Before 1999, all that was known to survive of Sullivan's setting was a copy of the leader violin part.<ref name=Perry>Perry, Helga J.

In April 1999, Sullivan scholars Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry announced that they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration &ndash; lacking only the second violin part &ndash; in a private collection of early band parts.  These materials, with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part, were later published and professionally recorded.<ref name=Perry/><ref>Miller, Bruce.

===Dialogue for Cousin Hebe===
[[Image:Jessiehebe.jpg|right|frame|[[Jessie Bond|Bond]] as Hebe with [[George Grossmith|Grossmith]] as Sir Joseph, 1887 revival]]

In the licensing copy of the libretto, Sir Joseph's cousin Hebe had lines of dialogue in several scenes in Act II. In the scene that follows No. 14 ("Things are seldom what they seem"), she accompanied Sir Joseph onstage and echoed the First Lord's dissatisfaction with Josephine. After several interruptions, Sir Joseph urged her to be quiet, eliciting the response "Crushed again!" Gilbert would later re-use this passage for Lady Jane in ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''.  Hebe was also assigned several lines of dialogue after No. 18 ("Carefully on tiptoe stealing") and again after No. 19 ("Farewell, my own").<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/pinafore/html/hebe.htm Hebe's cut dialogue after Nos. 14 and 19] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 April 2009</ref><ref name=critical>Young, Percy M. (ed.) "H.M.S. Pinafore", critical edition, 2003, 2 vols., Broude Brothers Limited ISBN 0845030035</ref>

Late in rehearsals for the original production, Jessie Bond assumed the role of Hebe, replacing Mrs. Howard Paul.  Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress, did not feel capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue.  Hebe's dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances, particularly her lines in the scene following No. 14.<ref name=Hebe>Shepherd, Marc. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/pinafore/html/expanded_hebe.htm Hebe's Dialogue Introduction] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 April 2009</ref>

===Recitative preceding the Act II finale===
The dialogue preceding the Act II finale, starting with "Here, take her sir, and mind you treat her kindly", was originally recitative.  The music for this passage was printed in the first edition of the vocal score as No. 20a.  Shortly after opening night, the recitative was dropped, and the lines thereafter were performed as spoken dialogue.  In modern productions, the recitative is occasionally restored in place of the dialogue.<ref name=critical/><ref name=DeOrsey/>

==Adaptations==
[[File:PinaforePictureBook.png|left|thumb|''The Pinafore Picture Book'', 1908]]
''H.M.S. Pinafore'' has been adapted many times. W. S. Gilbert wrote a 1909 children's book called ''The Pinafore Picture Book'', illustrated by [[Alice B. Woodward|Alice Woodward]], which retells the story of ''Pinafore'', in some cases giving considerable backstory that is not found in the libretto.<ref>Stedman, p. 331</ref><ref>Gilbert, W. S. [http://books.google.com/books?id=dFgCAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Gilbert+Sullivan+Pinafore&ei=g_vlSZGWFYzMlQTaqNDiBA ''The Pinafore Picture Book''], London: George Bell and Sons, 1908, a children's retelling of ''Pinafore''</ref>  Many other children's books have since been written retelling the story of ''Pinafore'' or adapting characters or events from ''Pinafore''.<ref>Dillard, pp. 103<U+2013>05 lists five.</ref>  

Many musical theatre adaptations have been produced since the original opera. Notable examples include a 1945 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical adapted by [[George S. Kaufman]], called ''[[Hollywood Pinafore]]'', using Sullivan's music.<ref>Kaufman, George S. ''Hollywood Pinafore or the Lad Who Loved a Salary'', Dramatists Play Service (1998) ISBN 0822216477</ref>  This was revived several times, including in London in 1998.<ref name=Br170>Bradley (2005), p. 170</ref>  Essgee Entertainment produced an adapted version of ''Pinafore'' in 1997 in Australia and New Zealand<ref>[http://essgee.com/html/PINindex.html Essgee Entertainment ''Pinafore'' pages] Essgee Entertainment, accessed 10 March 2009</ref> that has been much revived.<ref>Bradley (2005), Chapter 4</ref>  In 1940, the American Negro Light Opera Association produced the first of several productions set in the [[Caribbean Sea]], ''Tropical Pinafore''.<ref name=Br170/>  An early [[Yiddish]] adaptation of ''Pinafore'' was given by the G&S Yiddish Light Opera Company in 1952, and another, written by Al Grand, called ''Der Shirtz'' has been performed since 1970, in which the tenor cannot marry the soprano because she is a gentile, but at the eleventh hour it is revealed that she is really Jewish ("Er Iz a Guter Yid").<ref>Bradley (2005), p. 172</ref>  Another musical adaptation is ''Pinafore! (A Saucy, Sexy, Ship-Shape New Musical)'', adapted by [[Mark Savage (American playwright)|Mark Savage]].  It was first performed at the Celebration Theater in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] on 7 September 2001, directed by Savage, where it ran with great success for nine months.  It then played in Chicago and New York in 2003.<ref>Bradley (2005), pp. 170<U+2013>71</ref>   In this adaptation, only one character is female, and all but one of the male characters are gay.  A recording was issued in 2002 by Belva Records.<ref>Shepherd, Marc. [http://www.cris.com/~oakapple/gasdisc/pinbelva.htm "The Celebration Theater Pinafore! (2002)"] at A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 3 June 2002, accessed 10 March 2009</ref>  ''Pinafore Swing'' is a musical with music arranged by [[Sarah Travis]].  It premiered at the [[Watermill Theatre]] in England in 2004 in a production directed by [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]].  The adaptation, set in 1944, changes the characters into members of a band entertaining the sailors on a [[World War II]] troop ship in the Atlantic.  The reduced-size acting cast also serve as the orchestra for the singing roles, and the music is infused with swing rhythms.<ref>[http://www.newburytheatre.co.uk/archive/200407b.htm "Watermill - ''Pinafore Swing''",] Collected newspaper reviews of ''Pinafore Swing'', reprinted at the Newbury theatre guide archive, accessed 10 March 2009</ref>  Numerous productions in recent decades have been set ''[[Star Wars]]'' or ''[[Star Trek]]'' style.<ref name=Br170/>

==Cultural impact==
{{main|Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan}}
Among its other influences on popular culture, ''Pinafore'' had perhaps its most profound influence on the development of [[musical theatre]].  According to theatre historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]], ''Pinafore'' "became an international sensation, reshaping the commercial theater in both England and the United States."<ref>Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/g&scanon.htm "Gilbert & Sullivan 101: The G&S Canon",] ''The Cyber Encyclopedia of Musical Theatre, TV and Film'', accessed 10 March 2009.  See also G<U+00E4>nzl (1995).</ref>  Music writer [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]] notes, "The success of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' in 1879 established British comic opera alongside French op<U+00E9>ra bouffe throughout the English-speaking world".<ref>Lamb, p. 35</ref>  Historian John Bush Jones opines that ''Pinafore'' and the other Savoy operas demonstrate that musical theatre "can address contemporary social and political issues without sacrificing entertainment value" and that ''Pinafore'' created the model for a new kind of musical theatre, the "integrated" musical, where "book, lyrics, and music combined to form an integral whole".<ref>Jones, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>  He adds that its "unprecedented ... popularity fostered an American audience for musical theatre, while the show itself became a model for form, content, and even intention of ... musicals ever since, especially socially relevant musicals."<ref>Jones, pp. 4<U+2013>5</ref> Its popularity also led to the musical theatre adaptations of ''Pinafore'' described above, musicals in which the story line involves a production of ''Pinafore''<ref>Bradley (2005), p. 8</ref> and other musicals that parody the opera or that use or adapt its music.<ref>A 1938 Broadway show [http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11585 ''Knights of Song''], used six songs from ''Pinafore''.  Other examples include ''The Pirates of Pinafore'', ''The Pinafore Pirates'' (which Bradley calls "splendid" and describes in detail in Bradley (2005), pp. 174<U+2013>75), [http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/fraser.charlton/myshows/page24/mutiny.html ''Mutiny on the Pinafore'',] and [http://home.att.net/~coriolan/musical/hmsdumbledore.htm ''H.M.S. Dumbledore'',] all described at [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/parodies/html/parodies.html ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive''], accessed 7 May 2009.</ref>

Likewise, the opera's popularity has led to the widespread parody and [[pastiche]] of its songs in politics, literature and films, on television and in a variety of other media.<ref>Bradley (2005), chapter 8</ref>  Many comedians have used ''Pinafore'' songs for comic and satiric effect.  For example, in his comedy album ''[[My Son, the Celebrity]]'', [[Allan Sherman]] parodies "When I Was a Lad" from the point of view of a young man who goes to an [[Ivy League]] school and then rises to prominence in business.  At the end of the song, he "thanks [[Yale University|old Yale]]", "thanks the Lord" and thanks his father, "who is chairman of the board".<ref>Sherman, Allan.  ''[[My Son, the Celebrity]]'' (1963).  On his [[Allan in Wonderland|next album]], Sherman sings a song called "Little Butterball" to the tune of "I'm Called Little Buttercup".  See Sherman, Allan.  [http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/sherman_allan/albums.jhtml?albumId=696185 Track listing] from ''[[Allan in Wonderland]]'' (1964), accessed 10 March 2009</ref>  Literary references to ''Pinafore'' songs include Harris's attempt to sing "When I Was a Lad" in [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]''.<ref>[http://www.online-literature.com/jerome/three-men-in-a-boat/8/ "Three Men in a Boat",] chapter 8, accessed 24 April 2009</ref>  Another is found in the story "[[Runaround]]" from ''[[I, Robot]]'' by [[Isaac Asimov]], where a robot sings part of "I'm Called Little Buttercup".<ref>Asimov, Isaac. ''I, Robot'', New York: Doubleday & Company, 1950.  For examples of references to ''Pinafore'' in several novels, see Bradley (2005), pp. 10<U+2013>11.  Other literary references include Gilbert's own 1908 children's book, [http://books.google.com/books?id=dFgCAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Gilbert+Sullivan+Pinafore&ei=g_vlSZGWFYzMlQTaqNDiBA ''The Pinafore Picture Book'',] London: George Bell and Sons, 1908, accessed 1 May 2009.  In addition, Gilbert and Sullivan refer to ''Pinafore'' in two of their subsequent operas: in the "[[Major General's Song|Major-General's Song]]" from their next opera, ''Pirates'', and with the appearance of an older "Captain Corcoran, KCB", in ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'', the only recurring character in the G&S canon.</ref>  Political references include a 1996 satiric pastiche of "When I Was a Lad" aimed at [[Tony Blair]] by Virgina Bottomley, heritage secretary under [[John Major]].<ref>Bradley (2005), p. 166</ref>  Sporting references include a racehorse named "H.M.S. Pinafore".<ref>Racing: York Meeting, ''The Times'', 21 May 1946, p. 2</ref>  ''Pinafore'' songs and images have been used extensively in advertising.  According to Jones, "''Pinafore'' launched the first media blitz in the United States" beginning in 1879,<ref name=Jones8/> and recent ads include a television campaign for [[Terry's Chocolate Orange]] featuring a pastiche of "When I Was a Lad".<ref>Bradley (2005), p. 167</ref> ''Pinafore''-themed merchandise includes trading cards that were created in the 1880s.<ref>[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/pinafore/sapolio/spolio.html ''Pinafore'' advertising cards] at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 10 March 2009</ref>

;Film references
In recent decades, songs from ''Pinafore'', have been used frequently to give period flavor to films.  Prominent examples include the 1981 historical film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', in which the protagonist, [[Harold Abrahams]], and others from [[Cambridge University]], sing "He Is an Englishman".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082158/soundtrack Track listing for ''Chariots of Fire'',] IMDB database, accessed on 18 July 2008</ref>  This song also features at the end of the 1983 BBC drama ''[[An Englishman Abroad]]''.<ref>[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/movies/98/02/19/ALAN_BENNETT.html ''Boston Phoenix'' review of [[Alan Bennett]] retrospective, ] accessed on 4 February 2009</ref> In the 2003 movie ''[[Peter Pan (2003 film)|Peter Pan]]'', the Darling family sings "When I Was a Lad".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316396/soundtrack Track listing for ''Peter Pan'' (2003), ] IMDB database, accessed on 18 July 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316396/trivia Explanation of context of "When I Was a Lad" in ''Peter Pan'' (2003), ] IMDB dabase, accessed on 18 July 2008</ref>  In ''[[Wyatt Earp (film)|Wyatt Earp]]'' (1994), the famed lawman meets his future wife when he sees her playing in an early production of ''Pinafore''.<ref>Bradley (2005), p. 12</ref>  A 1953 biopic, ''[[The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan]]'', uses music from ''Pinafore''.
