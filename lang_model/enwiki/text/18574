'''Jerome David Salinger''' (born [[January 1]], [[1919]]) ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>s<U+00E6>l<U+0268>nd<U+0292><U+025A>}}) is an [[United States|American]] author best known for his 1951 [[novel]] ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' and his reclusive nature. He has not published original work since 1965 and has not been interviewed since 1980.

Raised in [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]], [[New York]], Salinger began writing [[short story|short stories]] while in secondary school, and published several stories in the early 1940s before serving in [[World War II]].  In 1948 he published the critically-acclaimed story "[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]" in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine, which became home to much of his subsequent work.  In 1951 Salinger released his first novel, ''The Catcher in the Rye'', an immediate popular success.  His depiction of [[adolescent]] alienation and loss of innocence in the protagonist [[Holden Caulfield]] was influential, especially among adolescent readers.<ref name= "sonny">{{cite news |last=Skow |first=John |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938775,00.html |title=Sonny: An Introduction |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1961-09-15 |accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>  The novel remains widely-read, selling about 250,000 copies a year.

The success of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' led to public attention and scrutiny; Salinger became reclusive, publishing new work less frequently.  He followed ''Catcher'' with three collections of short stories: ''[[Nine Stories (Salinger)|Nine Stories]]'' (1953), ''[[Franny and Zooey]]'' (1961), and ''[[Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction]]'' (1963).  His last published work, a [[novella]] entitled "[[Hapworth 16, 1924]]," appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in 1965.

Afterwards, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal battle in the 1980s with biographer [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] and the release in the late 1990s of memoirs written by two people close to him: [[Joyce Maynard]], an ex-lover; and Margaret Salinger, his daughter.  In 1997, a small publisher announced a deal with Salinger to publish "Hapworth 16, 1924" in book form, but amid the ensuing publicity, the release was indefinitely delayed.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jerome David Salinger was born in [[Manhattan, New York|Manhattan]], [[New York]], on [[New Year's Day]], 1919. His mother, Marie Jillich, was half-[[Scottish people|Scottish]] and half-[[Irish people|Irish]].<ref name= "sonny"/> His father, Sol Salinger, was a [[Jewish]] man of [[Poles|Polish]] origin who worked for a meat importer. When they married, Salinger's mother changed her name to Miriam and passed for Jewish. Salinger did not find out that his mother was not [[Jewish]] until just after his [[bar mitzvah]].<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 20.</ref>  He had only one sibling: his sister Doris, who was born in 1911.<ref>Alexander (1999). p. 32.</ref>

The young Salinger attended public schools on the West Side of Manhattan, then moved to the private [[McBurney School]] for ninth and tenth grades. He acted in several plays and "showed an innate talent for drama," though his father was opposed to the idea of J.D. becoming an actor.<ref>Lutz (2001). p. 10.</ref>  He was happy to get away from his over-protective mother by entering the [[Valley Forge Military Academy]] in [[Wayne, Pennsylvania]].<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 31.</ref>  Though he had written for the school newspaper at McBurney, at Valley Forge Salinger began writing stories "under the covers [at night], with the aid of a flashlight."<ref>Alexander (1999). p. 42.</ref> He started his freshman year at [[New York University]] in 1936 (purported to have considered studying special education) but dropped out the following spring.  That fall, his father urged him to learn about the meat-importing business and he was sent to work at a company in [[Vienna, Austria]].<ref name= "thirtynine">Salinger, M (2000). p. 39.</ref>

He left [[Austria]] only a month or so before the country fell to Hitler, on [[March 12]], [[1938]]. He attended [[Ursinus College]] in [[Collegeville, Pennsylvania]], for only one semester. In 1939, Salinger attended a [[Columbia University]] evening writing class taught by [[Whit Burnett]], longtime editor of ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine.  According to Burnett, Salinger did not distinguish himself until a few weeks before the end of the second semester, at which point "he suddenly came to life" and completed three stories.<ref name= "burnett">Alexander (1999). p. 55-58.  Burnett's quotes were included in ''Fiction Writer's Handbook'', edited by Whit and Hallie Burnett and published in 1975.</ref>  Burnett told Salinger that his stories were skillful and accomplished, and accepted "[[The Young Folks]]", a [[vignette (literature)|vignette]] about several aimless youths, for publication in ''Story''.<ref name= "burnett"/>  Salinger's debut short story was published in the magazine's March-April 1940 issue.  Burnett became Salinger's mentor, and they corresponded for several years.<ref>Alexander (1999). p. 55, 63-65.</ref>

===World War II===
In 1941, Salinger started dating [[Oona O'Neill]], daughter of the playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Despite finding the debutante self-absorbed (he confided to a friend that "Little Oona's hopelessly in love with little Oona"), he called her often and wrote her long letters.<ref name= "oona">{{cite book |last=Scovell |first=Jane |authorlink= |title=Oona Living in the Shadows: A Biography of Oona O'Neill Chaplin |year=1998 |publisher=Warner |location=New York |id=ISBN 0-446-51730-5 }} p. 87.</ref>  Their relationship ended when Oona began seeing [[Charlie Chaplin]], whom she eventually married.<ref name= "trespass">{{cite news |last=Sheppard |first=R.Z |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,967473-1,00.html |title=Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted: ''In Search of J.D.

The same year, Salinger began submitting short stories to ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  A selective magazine, it rejected seven of Salinger's stories that year, including "Lunch for Three," "Monologue for a Watery Highball," and "I Went to School with Adolf Hitler." In December 1941, however, it accepted "[[Slight Rebellion off Madison]]," a Manhattan-set story about a disaffected teenager named [[Holden Caulfield]] with "pre-war jitters."<ref name= "yagoda">{{cite book |last=Yagoda |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Yagoda |coauthors= |title=About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made |year=2000 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |id=ISBN 0-684-81605-9}} pp. 98, 233.</ref>  When Japan carried out the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that month, the story was rendered "unpublishable"; it did not appear in the magazine until 1946.<ref name= "yagoda"/>

In the spring of 1942, several months after the United States entered [[World War II]], Salinger was drafted into the Army, where he saw combat with the [[U.S. 12th Infantry Regiment]] in some of the fiercest fighting of the war.<ref name= "cruise"/>  He was active at [[Utah Beach]] on [[D-Day]] and in the [[Battle of the Bulge]].<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 58.</ref> During the campaign from Normandy into Germany, Salinger arranged to meet with [[Ernest Hemingway]], a writer who had influenced him and was working as a war correspondent in Paris.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lamb |first=Robert Paul|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_n4_v42/ai_20119140/pg_17 |title=Hemingway and the creation of twentieth-century dialogue - American author Ernest Hemingway |publisher=Twentieth Century Literature |date=Winter 1996 |accessdate=2007-07-10 |format=reprint}}</ref>  Salinger was impressed with Hemingway's friendliness and modesty, finding him more "soft" than his gruff public persona.<ref name= "baker">{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Carlos |authorlink=Carlos Baker |coauthors= |title=Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story |year=1969 |publisher=Charles Scribner<U+2019>s Sons |location=New York |id=ISBN 0-020-01690-5}} p. 420, 646.</ref>  Hemingway was impressed by Salinger's writing, and remarked: "Jesus, he has a helluva talent."<ref name= "sonny"/>  The two writers began corresponding; according to Hemingway biographer [[Carlos Baker]], Salinger wrote Hemingway in July 1946 that their talks "had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war".<ref name= "baker"/> Salinger added that he was working on a play about Holden Caulfield and hoped to play the part himself, "suitably disguised with crew-cut hair and a [[Max Factor]] belly dimple."<ref name= "baker"/>

Salinger was assigned to a [[counter-intelligence]] division, where he used his proficiency in French and German to interrogate [[prisoners of war]].<ref name= "fiff">Salinger, M (2000). p.55</ref> He was also among the first soldiers to enter a liberated [[concentration camp]].<ref name= "fiff"/>  Salinger's experiences in the war affected him emotionally.  He was hospitalized for a few weeks for [[combat stress reaction]] after Germany was defeated,<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 89.</ref><ref>Lutz (2001). p. 7.</ref> and he later told his daughter: "You never really get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose entirely, no matter how long you live."<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 55.</ref>  Both of his biographers speculate that Salinger drew upon his wartime experiences in several stories,<ref name= "at fifty">{{cite news |last=Menand |first=Louis |authorlink=Louis Menand |url= http://homepage.mac.com/mseffie/assignments/catcher/HoldenatFifty.pdf |title=Holden at Fifty: ''The Catcher in the Rye'' and what it spawned |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2001-10-01 |accessdate=2007-07-10 |format=reprint}}</ref> such as "[[For Esm<U+00E9> with Love and Squalor]]," which is narrated by a traumatized soldier.  Salinger wrote while serving, and published several stories in [[slick]] magazines such as ''[[Collier's]]'' and the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''.  He continued to submit stories to ''The New Yorker'', but with little success; it rejected all of his submissions from 1944 to 1946, and in 1945 rejected a group of 15 poems.<ref name= "yagoda"/>

===Post-war years===

After Germany's defeat, Salinger signed up for a six-month period of "de-Nazification" duty in Germany.<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 67.</ref> He met a woman named Sylvia, and they married in 1945.<ref name= "thir">Alexander (1999). p. 113.</ref>  He brought her to the United States, but the marriage fell apart after eight months and Sylvia returned to Germany.<ref name= "thir"/>  In 1972, his daughter Margaret was with her father when he received a letter from Sylvia. He looked at the envelope, and without reading it, tore it apart. It was the first time he had heard from her since the breakup, but as Margaret put it, "when he was finished with a person, he was through with them."<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 359.</ref>

In 1946, Whit Burnett agreed to help Salinger publish a collection of his short stories through ''Story'' Press's Lippincott Imprint.<ref name= "young">Alexander (1999). p. 118-20.</ref>  Titled ''The Young Folks'', the collection was to consist of twenty stories <U+2014> ten, like the title story and "Slight Rebellion off Madison", were already in print; ten were previously unpublished.<ref name= "young"/>  Though Burnett implied the book would be published and even negotiated Salinger a $1,000 advance on its sale, Lippincott overrulled Burnett and rejected the book.<ref name= "young"/>  Salinger blamed Burnett for the book's failure to see print, and the two became estranged.<ref>Alexander (1999). p. 120, 164, 204-5.</ref>

By the late 1940s, Salinger had become an avid follower of [[Zen Buddhism]], to the point that he "gave reading lists on the subject to his dates"<ref name= "sonny"/> and arranged a meeting with Buddhist scholar [[D. T. Suzuki]].  In 1948, he submitted a short story titled "[[A Perfect Day for Bananafish]]" to ''The New Yorker''.  The magazine was so impressed with "the singular quality of the story" that its editors accepted it for publication immediately, and signed Salinger to a contract that allowed them [[right of first refusal]] on any future stories.<ref>Alexander (1999). p. 124.</ref>  The critical acclaim accorded "Bananafish", coupled with problems Salinger had with stories being altered by the "slicks", led him to publish almost exclusively in ''The New Yorker''.<ref>Alexander (1999). p. 130.</ref>  "Bananafish" was also the first of Salinger's published stories to feature the [[Glass family|Glasses]], a fictional family consisting of two retired [[vaudeville]] performers and their seven precocious children: [[Seymour Glass|Seymour]], Buddy, Boo Boo, Walt, Waker, Zooey, and Franny.<ref name= "glass">Crawford (2006). p. 97-99.</ref>  Salinger eventually published seven stories about the Glasses, developing a detailed family history and focusing particularly on Seymour, the troubled eldest child.<ref name= "glass"/>

In the early 1940s, Salinger had confided in a letter to Whit Burnett that he was eager to sell the film rights to some of his stories in order to achieve financial security.<ref name="holly">Hamilton (1988).  p. 75.</ref>  According to Ian Hamilton, Salinger was disappointed when "rumblings from Hollywood" over his 1943 short story "[[The Varioni Brothers]]" came to nothing. Therefore he immediately agreed when, in mid-1948, independent film producer [[Samuel Goldwyn]] offered to buy the film rights to his short story "[[Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut]]."<ref name="holly"/>  Though Salinger sold his story with the hope <U+2013> in the words of his agent Dorothy Olding <U+2013> that it "would make a good movie,"<ref>{{cite news |last=Fosburgh |first=Lacey |authorlink= Lacey Fosburgh |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C12F93F5816768FDDA80A94D9415B868BF1D3 |title=Why More Top Novelists Don't Go Hollywood |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1976-11-21 |accessdate=2007-04-06 |format= fee required}}</ref> the film version of "Wiggly" was lambasted by critics upon its release in 1949.<ref name= "berg">[[A.

===''The Catcher in the Rye''===
[[Image:rye catcher.jpg|thumb|right|Salinger's landmark 1951 novel, ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.]]
{{main|The Catcher in the Rye}}
Salinger had confided to several people that he felt Holden Caulfield deserved a novel,<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 77.</ref> and ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' was published on [[July 16]], [[1951]].  The novel's plot is simple,<ref name= "simp">Whitfield (1997). p. 77.</ref> detailing sixteen-year-old Holden's experiences in New York City following his expulsion from an elite [[college preparatory school|prep school]].  The book is more notable for the iconic persona and testimonial voice of its [[first-person narrative|first-person narrator]], Holden.<ref name="nandel">Nandel, Alan. "The Significance of Holden Caulfield's Testimony". Reprinted in Bloom, Harold, ed. ''Modern Critical Interpretations: J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye''. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2000. p. 75<U+2013>89.</ref>  He serves as an insightful but [[unreliable narrator]] who expounds on the importance of loyalty, the "phoniness" of adulthood, and his own duplicity.<ref name="nandel"/>  In a 1953 interview with a high-school newspaper, Salinger admitted that the novel was "sort of" autobiographical, explaining that "My boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book.<U+2026> [I]t was a great relief telling people about it."<ref>Crawford (2006).  p. 4.</ref>

Initial reactions were mixed, ranging from ''[[The New York Times]]'''s hail of ''Catcher'' as "an unusually brilliant first novel"<ref>{{cite news |last=Burger |first= Nash K |url= http://partners.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/specials/salinger-rye02.html |title=Books of The Times|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1951-07-16 |accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> to denigrations of the book's monotonous language and the "immorality and perversion" of Holden,<ref name= "virginia">Whitfield, Stephen J.

Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[11-27]].  In a review of the book in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', the reviewer found the book unfit "for children to read," writing that they would be influenced by Holden, "as too easily happens when immorality and perversion are recounted by writers of talent whose work is countenanced in the name of art or good intention."</ref> who uses religious slurs and casually discusses [[premarital sex]] and [[prostitution]].<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 117.</ref>  The novel was a popular success; within two months of its publication, ''The Catcher in the Rye'' had been reprinted eight times, and spent thirty weeks on the [[New York Times Bestseller|''New York Times'' Bestseller list]].<ref name= "simp"/>

The book's initial success was followed by a brief lull in popularity, but by the late 1950s, according to Ian Hamilton, it had "become the book all brooding adolescents had to buy, the indispensable manual from which cool styles of disaffectation could be borrowed."<ref name= "cult">Hamilton (1988). p. 155.</ref>  Newspapers began publishing articles about the "Catcher Cult",<ref name= "cult"/> and the novel was [[Ban (law)|banned]] in several countries <U+2013> as well as some U.S. schools <U+2013> because of its subject matter and what ''[[Catholic World]]'' reviewer Riley Hughes called an "excessive use of amateur swearing and coarse language".<ref name= "swearing">Whitfield (1997). p. 97.</ref>  One irate parent counted 237 appearances of the word "goddamn" in the novel, along with 58 "bastard"s, 31 "Chrissakes," and 6 "fuck"s.<ref name= "swearing"/>

In the 1970s, several U.S. high school teachers who assigned the book were fired or forced to resign.  In 1979 one book-length study of [[censorship]] noted that ''The Catcher in the Rye'' "had the dubious distinction of being at once the most frequently censored book across the nation and the second-most frequently taught novel in public high schools [after [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'']."<ref name= "cens">Whitfield (1997). p. 82, 78.</ref>  The book remains widely read; as of 2004, the novel was selling about 250,000 copies per year, "with total worldwide sales over <U+2013> probably way over <U+2013> 10 million."<ref>{{cite news |last=Yardley |first= Jonathan |authorlink= Jonathan Yardley |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43680-2004Oct18.html |title=J.D.

In the wake of its 1950s success, Salinger received (and rejected) numerous offers to adapt ''The Catcher in the Rye'' for the screen, including one from Samuel Goldwyn.<ref name="berg"/>  Since its publication, there has been sustained interest in the novel among filmmakers, with [[Billy Wilder]],<ref>[[Cameron Crowe|Crowe, Cameron]], ed.

===Writing in the 1950s and move to Cornish===

In a July 1951 profile in ''Book of the Month Club News'', Salinger's friend and ''New Yorker'' editor [[William Keepers Maxwell, Jr.|William Maxwell]] asked Salinger about his literary influences.  Salinger responded: "A writer, when he's asked to discuss his craft, ought to get up and call out in a loud voice just the names of the writers he loves. I love [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Sean O'Casey|O'Casey]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], [[Federico Garc<U+00ED>a Lorca|Lorca]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], [[Robert Burns|Burns]], [[Emily Bront<U+00EB>|E.

''The Book of the Month: Sixty Years of Books in American Life''. Boston: Little, Brown, 1986. ISBN 0-316-10119-2.  pp. 129<U+2013>130.</ref>  In letters written in the 1940s, Salinger had expressed his admiration of three living, or recently-deceased, writers: [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Ring Lardner]], and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]];<ref name= "influ">Hamilton (1988). p. 53.</ref> Ian Hamilton wrote that Salinger even saw himself for some time as "Fitzgerald's successor."<ref>Hamilton (1988) p. 64.</ref>

After several years of practicing Zen Buddhism, in 1952, while reading the gospels of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious teacher [[Sri Ramakrishna]], Salinger wrote friends of a momentous change in his life.<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 127.</ref>  He became an adherent of Ramakrishna's [[Advaita Vedanta]] Hinduism, which advocated celibacy for those seeking enlightenment, and detachment from human responsibilities such as family.<ref name="vive">Hamilton (1988). p. 129.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ranchan |first=Som P. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=An Adventure in Vedanta: J.

In 1953, Salinger published a collection of seven stories from ''The New Yorker'' ("Bananafish" among them), as well as two that the magazine had rejected. The collection was published as ''[[Nine Stories (Salinger)|Nine Stories]]'' in the United States, and ''[[For Esm<U+00E9> with Love and Squalor]]'' in the UK, after one of Salinger's best-known stories.<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 92.</ref>  The book received grudgingly positive reviews, and was a financial success <U+2013> "remarkably so for a volume of short stories," according to Hamilton.<ref name= "niney">Hamilton (1988). pp. 136-7.</ref>  ''Nine Stories'' spent three months on the ''New York Times'' Bestseller list.<ref name= "niney"/>  Already tightening his grip on publicity, though, Salinger refused to allow publishers of the collection to depict his characters in dust jacket illustrations, lest readers form preconceived notions of them.

As the notoriety of ''The Catcher in the Rye'' grew, Salinger gradually withdrew from public view. In 1953, he moved from New York to [[Cornish, New Hampshire|Cornish]], [[New Hampshire]]. Early in his time at Cornish he was relatively sociable, particularly with students at [[Windsor High School]]. Salinger invited them to his house frequently to play records and talk about problems at school.<ref name= "twelve">Crawford (2006). p. 12-14.</ref>  One such student, Shirley Blaney, persuaded Salinger to be interviewed for the high school page of ''The Daily Eagle'', the city paper.  However, after Blaney's interview appeared prominently in the newspaper's editorial section, Salinger cut off all contact with the high schoolers without explanation.<ref name= "twelve"/>  He was also seen less frequently around town, only seeing one close friend with any regularity, jurist [[Learned Hand]].<ref>Lutz (2001). p. 30.</ref>

===Marriage, family, and religious beliefs===

In June 1955, at the age of 36, Salinger married Claire Douglas, a [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]] student.  They had two children, Margaret (b. [[December 10]], [[1955]]) and [[Matt Salinger|Matt]] (b. [[February 13]], [[1960]].)  Margaret Salinger wrote in her memoir ''Dream Catcher'' that she believes her parents would not have married <U+2013> nor would she have been born <U+2013> had her father not read the teachings of a disciple of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], which brought the possibility of enlightenment to those following the path of the "householder" (a married person with children).<ref name="eiga">Salinger, M (2000). p. 89.</ref>  After their marriage, J.D. and Claire were initiated into the path of [[Kriya yoga]] in a small store-front Hindu temple in [[Washington, D.C.]], during the summer of 1955.<ref name="nine">Salinger, M (2000). p. 90.</ref>  They received a mantra and breathing exercises to practice for ten minutes twice a day.<ref name="nine"/>

Salinger also insisted that Claire [[drop out]] of school and live with him, only four months shy of graduation, which she did. Certain elements of the story "Franny", published in January, 1955, are based on his relationship with Claire, including the fact that Claire owned the book ''[[The Way of the Pilgrim]]''.<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 84.</ref>  Due to their isolated location and Salinger's proclivities, they hardly saw other people for long stretches of time.  Claire was also frustrated by J.D.'s ever-changing religious beliefs.  Though she committed herself to Kriya yoga, she remembered that Salinger would chronically leave Cornish to work on a story "for several weeks only to return with the piece he was supposed to be finishing all undone or destroyed and some new 'ism' we had to follow."<ref name="Salinger94">Salinger, M (2000). p. 94-5.</ref>  Claire believed "it was to cover the fact that Jerry had just destroyed or junked or couldn't face the quality of, or couldn't face publishing, what he had created."<ref name="Salinger94"/>

After abandoning Kriya yoga, Salinger tried [[Dianetics]] (later called [[Scientology]]), even meeting its founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], according to Claire.<ref name="Salinger94"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Dinitia |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/books/083000salinger-daughter.html  |title=Salinger's Daughter's Truths as Mesmerizing as His Fiction |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2000-08-30 |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>  This was followed by adherence to a number of spiritual, medical, and nutritional belief systems including [[Christian Science]], [[homeopathy]], [[acupuncture]], [[macrobiotics]], the teachings of [[Edgar Cayce]], [[fasting]], vomiting to remove impurities, megadoses of [[Vitamin C]],  [[urine therapy]], "speaking in tongues" (or [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] [[glossolalia]]), and sitting in a [[Wilhelm Reich|Reichian]] "orgone box" to accumulate "[[orgone energy]]".<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 94-5.

===Last publications and Maynard relationship===
Salinger published the collections ''[[Franny and Zooey]]'' in 1961, and ''[[Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction]]'' in 1963. Each book contained two short stories or [[novella]]s, previously published in ''The New Yorker'', about members of the Glass family.  On the dust jacket of ''Franny and Zooey'', Salinger wrote, in reference to his interest in privacy: "It is my rather subversive opinion that a writer's feelings of anonymity-obscurity are the second most valuable property on loan to him during his working years."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895497,00.html "People"], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], 1961-08-04.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[07-10]].</ref>

On [[September 15]], [[1961]], ''Time'' magazine devoted its cover to Salinger, in an article that profiled his "life of recluse"; ''Time'' reported that the Glass family series "is nowhere near completion<U+2026>Salinger intends to write a Glass trilogy".<ref name= "sonny"/> However, Salinger has only published one other story since.  His last published work was "[[Hapworth 16, 1924]]," an epistolary [[novella]] in the form of a long letter from seven-year-old Seymour Glass from summer camp. It took up most of the [[June 19]], [[1965]] issue of ''The New Yorker''. Around this time, Salinger had isolated Claire from friends and relatives and made her <U+2013> in the words of Margaret Salinger <U+2013> "a virtual prisoner".<ref name="Salinger94"/>  Claire separated from him in September 1966; their divorce was finalized on [[October 3]], [[1967]].<ref>Lutz (2001). p. 35.</ref>

In 1972, at the age of 53, Salinger had a year-long relationship with 18-year-old [[Joyce Maynard]], already an experienced writer for ''[[Seventeen (magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' had asked Maynard to write an article for them which, when published as "[http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/specials/maynard-mag.html An Eighteen Year Old Looks Back On Life]" on [[April 23]], [[1972]], made her a [[celebrity]]. Salinger wrote a letter to her warning about living with fame.  After exchanging 25 letters, Maynard moved in with Salinger the summer after her freshman year at [[Yale University]].<ref name= "women">{{cite news |last=Alexander |first=Paul |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/2162/ |title=J.

The relationship ended, he told his daughter Margaret at a family outing, because Maynard wanted children, and he felt he was too old.<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 361-2.</ref>

Salinger continued to write in a disciplined fashion, a few hours every morning; according to Maynard, by 1972 he had completed two new novels.<ref>Maynard (1998). p. 158.</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pollitt |first=Katha |authorlink= Katha Pollitt |url= http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/reviews/980913.13pollitt.html |title=With Love and Squalor |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1998-09-13 |accessdate=2007-04-14 }}</ref>  In a rare 1974 interview with ''The New York Times'', he explained: "There is a marvelous peace in not publishing.<U+2026> I like to write.

===Legal conflicts in 1980s and 1990s===

Although Salinger tried to escape public exposure as much as possible, he continued to struggle with unwanted attention from both the media and the public.<ref>Lutz (2001). p. 33.</ref>  Readers of his work and students from nearby [[Dartmouth College]] often came to Cornish in groups, hoping to catch a glimpse of him.<ref>Crawford (2006).  p. 79.</ref>  Upon learning in 1986 that the British writer [[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]] intended to publish ''In Search of J.D. Salinger: A Writing Life (1935-65)'', a biography including letters Salinger had written to other authors and friends, he [[lawsuit|sued]] to stop the book's publication. The book was finally published in 1988 with the letters' contents paraphrased.  The court ruled that Hamilton's extensive use of the letters went beyond the limits of [[fair use]], and that "the author of letters is entitled to a copyright in the letters, as with any other work of literary authorship."<ref name= "lubas">{{cite news |last=Lubasch |first=Arnold H |url= http://partners.nytimes.com/books/98/09/13/specials/salinger-blocked.html |title=Salinger Biography is Blocked |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=[[1987-01-30]] |accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>

An [[unintended consequence]] of the lawsuit was that many details of Salinger's private life, including that he had spent the last twenty years writing, in his words, "Just a work of fiction.<U+2026> That's all",<ref name= "depos"/> became public in the form of court transcripts.  Excerpts from his letters were also widely disseminated, most notably a bitter remark written in response to Oona O'Neill's marriage to Charlie Chaplin:

Salinger was romantically involved with television actress [[Elaine Joyce]] for several years in the 1980s.<ref name= "women">{{cite news |last=Alexander |first=Paul |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/features/2162/ |title=J.

In 1995, [[Iran]]ian director [[Dariush Mehrjui]] released the film ''[[Pari (film)|Pari]]'', an unauthorized and loose adaptation of Salinger's ''Franny and Zooey''.  Though the film could be distributed legally in Iran since the country has no official copyright relations with the United States,<ref>[http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.html Circular 38a] of the ''U.S. Copyright Office''</ref> Salinger had his lawyers block a planned screening of the film at the [[Lincoln Center]] in 1998.<ref name= "mehr">{{cite news |last=Mckinley |first=Jesse |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE2DD1330F932A15752C1A96E958260 |title=Iranian Film Is Canceled After Protest By Salinger |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1998-11-21 |accessdate=2007-04-05}}</ref>  Mehrjui called Salinger's action "bewildering", explaining that he saw his film as "a kind of cultural exchange".<ref name= "mehr">{{cite news |last=Mckinley |first=Jesse |url=http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00713FC38540C728EDDA80994D0494D81 |title=Iranian Film Is Canceled After Protest By Salinger |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=[[1998-11-21]] |accessdate=2007-04-05 |format= fee required}}</ref> 

In 1997 Salinger gave a small publisher, [[Orchises Press]], permission to publish "Hapworth 16, 1924," the previously uncollected novella. It was to be published that year, and listings for it appeared at [[Amazon.com]] and other book-sellers. After a flurry of articles and critical reviews of the story appeared in the press, the publication date was pushed back repeatedly, the last time to 2002.  It was not published and no new date has been set.<ref name= "orchise">Lutz (2001). p. 42-3.</ref>

===Recent privacy invasions===
In 1999, twenty-five years after the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard put up for [[auction]] a series of letters Salinger had written to her.  The sale helped to publicize Maynard's book ''At Home in the World: A Memoir'', published the same year.  Among other indiscretions, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author, and described Maynard's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she would have preferred to donate them to [[Beinecke Library]].  Software developer [[Peter Norton]] bought the letters for $156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.<ref name= "auction">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/books/news/9906/22/salinger.letters/ |title=Salinger letters bring $156,500 at auction |publisher=CNN |date=[[1999-06-22]] |accessdate=2007-04-12}}</ref>

[[Image:jd salinger.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Margaret Salinger's memoir ''Dream Catcher'', its cover featuring a rare photograph of Salinger.]]
A year later, Salinger's daughter Margaret, by his second wife Claire Douglas, published ''Dream Catcher: A Memoir''.  In her book, Ms. Salinger described the harrowing control Salinger had over her mother and dispelled many of the Salinger myths established by Ian Hamilton's book. One of Hamilton's arguments was that Salinger's experience with [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]] left him psychologically scarred, and that he was unable to deal with the traumatic nature of his war service. Though Ms. Salinger allowed that "the few men who lived through ['bloody [[Mortain]],' a battle in which her father fought] were left with much to sicken them, body and soul,"<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 55.</ref> she also painted a picture of J.D. as a man immensely proud of his service record, maintaining his military haircut, service jacket, and moving about his compound (and town) in an old Jeep.

Both Margaret and Maynard characterized Salinger as a devoted film buff.  According to Margaret, his favorite movies include ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'', ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'', ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' (Phoebe's favorite movie in ''The Catcher in the Rye''), and the comedies of [[W.C. Fields]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], and the [[Marx Brothers]].<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 7.</ref>  Predating VCRs, Salinger had an extensive collection of classic movies from the 1940s in 16&nbsp;mm prints. Maynard wrote that "he loves movies, not films",<ref>Maynard (1998).  p. 94.</ref> and his daughter argued that her father's "worldview is, essentially, a product of the movies of his day.  To my father, all Spanish speakers are [[Puerto Rican]] washerwomen, or the toothless, grinning gypsy types in a Marx Brothers movie."<ref>Salinger, M (2000). p. 195.</ref>

Margaret also offered many insights into other Salinger myths, including her father's supposed long-time interest in [[macrobiotics]] and involvement with "alternative medicine" and Eastern philosophies.  A few weeks after ''Dream Catcher'' was published, Margaret's brother [[Matt Salinger|Matt]] discredited the memoir in a letter to ''[[The New York Observer]]''.  He disparaged his sister's "gothic tales of our supposed childhood" and stated: "I can't say with any authority that she is consciously making anything up.  I just know that I grew up in a very different house, with two very different parents from those my sister describes."<ref name= "justice">{{cite news |last=Malcolm |first=Janet |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/14272 |title=Justice to J.

==Literary style and themes==

In a contributor's note Salinger gave to ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' in 1946, he wrote: "I almost always write about very young people", a statement which has been referred to as his [[credo]].<ref>Whitfield (1997). p. 96.</ref>  Adolescents are featured or appear in all of Salinger's work, from his first published short story, "The Young Folks", to ''The Catcher in the Rye'' and his [[Glass family]] stories.  In 1961, the critic [[Alfred Kazin]] explained that Salinger's choice of teenagers as a subject matter was one reason for his appeal to young readers, but another was "a consciousness [among youths] that he speaks for them and virtually ''to'' them, in a language that is peculiarly honest and their own, with a vision of things that capture their most secret judgments of the world."<ref>[[Alfred Kazin|Kazin, Alfred]].  "J.D. Salinger: "Everybody's Favorite"," [[The Atlantic Monthly]] 208.2, Aug. 1961.  Rpt. in [[Harold Bloom|Bloom, Harold]], ed. {{cite book |title=Bloom's BioCritiques: J. D. Salinger|year=2001 |publisher=Chelsea House |location=Philadelphia|id=ISBN 0-7910-6175-2 }} pp. 67-75.</ref>  Salinger's language, especially his energetic, realistically sparse dialogue, was revolutionary at the time his first stories were published, and was seen by several critics as "the most distinguishing thing" about his work.<ref>Shuman, R. Baird, ed.  ''Great American Writers: Twentieth Century.''  Vol. 13.  New York: Marshall Cavendish, 2002.  14 vols.  p. 1308.</ref>

Salinger identified closely with his characters,<ref name= "damned"/> and used techniques such as interior monologue, letters, and extended telephone calls to display his gift for dialogue. Such style elements also "[gave] him the illusion of having, as it were, delivered his characters' destinies into their own keeping."<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 70.</ref>  Recurring themes in Salinger's stories also connect to the ideas of innocence and adolescence, including the "corrupting influence of Hollywood and the world at large",<ref name="mondy">Mondloch, Helen.  "Squalor and Redemption: The Age of Salinger," [[The World & I]].  SIRS Knowledge Source: SIRS Renaissance.  Nov. 2003.  Retrieved on [[2004]]-[[04-02]].</ref> the disconnect between teenagers and "phony" adults,<ref name="mondy"/> and the perceptive, precocious intelligence of children.<ref name= "at fifty"/>

Contemporary critics discuss a clear progression over the course of Salinger's published work, as evidenced by the increasingly negative reviews received by each of his three post-''Catcher'' story collections.<ref>Lutz (2001). p. 34.</ref><ref name= "justice"/>  Ian Hamilton adheres to this view, arguing that while Salinger's early stories for the "slicks" boasted "tight, energetic" dialogue, they had also been formulaic and sentimental.  It took the standards of ''The New Yorker'' editors, among them [[William Shawn]], to refine his writing into the "spare, teasingly mysterious, withheld" qualities of "A Perfect Day for Bananafish", ''The Catcher in the Rye'', and his stories of the early 1950s.<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 105-6.</ref>  By the late 1950s, as Salinger became more reclusive and involved in religious study, Hamilton notes that his stories became longer, less plot-driven, and increasingly filled with [[digression]] and parenthetical remarks.<ref>Hamilton (1988). p. 188.</ref>  [[Louis Menand]] agrees, writing in ''The New Yorker'' that Salinger "stopped writing stories, in the conventional sense.<U+2026> He seemed to lose interest in fiction as an art form<U+2014>perhaps he thought there was something manipulative or inauthentic about literary device and authorial control."<ref name= "at fifty"/>  In recent years, Salinger's later work has been defended by some critics; in 2001, [[Janet Malcolm]] wrote in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' that "Zooey" "is arguably Salinger's masterpiece.<U+2026> Rereading it and its companion piece "Franny" is no less rewarding than rereading ''[[The Great Gatsby]]''."<ref name= "justice"/>

==Influence==
Salinger's writing has influenced several prominent writers, prompting [[Harold Brodkey]] (himself an [[O. Henry Prize]]-winning author) to state in 1991: "His is the most influential body of work in English prose by anyone since Hemingway."<ref>{{cite news |last=Brozan |first=Nadine |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D81030F934A15757C0A967958260 |title=Chronicle |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1991-04-27 |accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref>  Of the writers in Salinger's generation, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novelist [[John Updike]] attested that "the short stories of J. D. Salinger really opened my eyes as to how you can weave fiction out of a set of events that seem almost unconnected, or very lightly connected.<U+2026> [Reading Salinger] stick[s] in my mind as really having moved me a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material."<ref>Osen, Diane.  [http://www.nationalbook.org/authorsguide_jupdike.html "Interview with John Updike"], The National Book Foundation.  2007.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[07-10]].</ref>  The critic [[Louis Menand]] has observed that the early stories of Pulitzer Prize-winner [[Philip Roth]] were affected by "Salinger's voice and comic timing."<ref name= "at fifty"/>

[[National Book Award]] finalist [[Richard Yates (novelist)|Richard Yates]] told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1977 that reading Salinger's stories for the first time was a landmark experience, and that "nothing quite like it has happened to me since."<ref>[[Richard Yates (novelist)|Yates, Richard]]. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C16FB3E5E137B93C6A91789D95F438785F9 "Writers' Writers"] (fee required), [[The New York Times]], 1977-12-04.  Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[10-24]].  Relevant passage is [http://www.richardyates.org/bib_onsalinger.html excerpted] on richardyates.org.</ref>  Yates describes Salinger as "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, and who knew exactly what he was doing in every silence as well as in every word." The [[O. Henry Award]]-winning short story by [[Gordon Lish]], "For Jerom<U+00E9><U+2014>With Love and Kisses" (collected in ''What I Know So Far'', 1984), is a parody of Salinger's "For Esm<U+00E9><U+2014>with Love and Squalor."<ref>http://www.enotes.com/short-story-criticism/lish-gordon</ref>

In 2001, Louis Menand wrote in ''The New Yorker'' that "''Catcher in the Rye'' rewrites" among each new generation had become "a literary genre all its own."<ref name= "at fifty"/>  He classed among them [[Sylvia Plath]]'s ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' (1963), [[Hunter Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1971), [[Jay McInerney]]'s ''[[Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1984), and [[Dave Eggers]]'s ''[[A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]]'' (2000).  The writer [[Aimee Bender]] was struggling with her first short stories when a friend gave her a copy of ''Nine Stories''; inspired, she later described Salinger's effect on writers, explaining: "[I]t feels like Salinger wrote ''The Catcher in the Rye'' in a day, and that incredible feeling of ease inspires writing.  Inspires the pursuit of voice.  Not his voice.  My voice.  Your voice."<ref>[[Aimee Bender|Bender, Aimee]].  "Holden Schmolden."  Kotzen, Kip, and Thomas Beller, ed.
