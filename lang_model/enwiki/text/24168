{{For|a general discussion of the law of murder|murder}}

In the [[United States]],  the principle of [[federalism|dual sovereignty]]  applies to homicide, as to other crimes. If '''murder''' is committed within  the borders of a [[U.S. state|state]],  that state has jurisdiction. If the victim is a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] official, an [[ambassador]], [[consul]] or other foreign official under  the protection of the United States, or if the crime took place on  federal property or involved crossing state lines, or in a manner that  substantially affects [[interstate commerce]] or [[national security]], then the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] also has jurisdiction. If a crime  is not committed within any state, then Federal jurisdiction is  exclusive: examples include the [[District of Columbia]], [[naval]] or U.S.-flagged [[United States Merchant Marine|merchant vessels]]  in [[international waters]], or a U.S. military base. In cases  where a murder involves both state and federal jurisdiction, the  offender can be tried and punished separately for each crime without  raising issues of [[double jeopardy]],  unless the court believes that the new prosecution is merely a "sham"  forwarded by the prior prosecutor.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/94-1664.ZO.html  Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81 (1996)]</ref>

Modern  codifications tend to create a genus of offenses, known collectively as [[homicide]], of which ''murder'' is the most serious species, followed  by [[Manslaughter|manslaughter]] which is less serious, and ending finally in [[justifiable homicide]], which is not a crime at all.  Because there are 51 jurisdictions, each with its own criminal code,  this section treats only the crime of murder, and does not deal with  state-by-state  specifics.

At base, murder consists of an intentional unlawful  act with a design to kill and fatal consequences. Generally, an  intention to cause great bodily harm is considered indistinguishable  from an intention to kill, as is an act so inherently dangerous that any  [[reasonable person]] would realize the likelihood of  fatality. Thus, if the defendant hurled the victim from a bridge, it is  no defense to argue that harm was not contemplated, or that the  defendant hoped only to break bones.

Murder is the unlawful  killing of a human being with [[malice aforethought]].<ref>{{usc|18|1111}}</ref>  Malice can be expressed (intent to kill) or implied. Implied malice is  proven by acts that involve reckless indifference to human life or in a  death that occurs during the commission of certain felonies (the felony  murder rule). The exact terms of the felony murder vary tremendously  from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Life sentencing for murder in the  United States has a mean of 349 months (29 years one month) and a median  of 480 months (40 years).<ref>[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/ascii/fdluc02.txt  US Dept. of Justice: Felony Defendants in  Large Urban Counties, 2002]</ref>  However, some states' sentencings contemplate a full life's  confinement, whence the sentence of confinement is not deemed fulfilled  while the convicted person lives; and the only way to fulfill the  sentence (and thereby obtain release from confinement) is by the  individuals death.  These sentences are termed natural life and/or life  without the possibility of parole. Additionally, life without the possibility of parole can be defined under special circumstances for example in the course of a robbery or additional crimes. (People v. Horn) Court of Appeals of California, Fourth District, Division One

==Degrees of murder in the United States==<!-- This section is  linked from [[John Belushi]]  --><!--  First-degree  murder and Second-degree  murder no longer redirect here, as the US is not the only nation that  uses these terms -->
Before  the famous case of ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' in 1972, most states distinguished  two degrees of murder. While the rules differed by state, a reasonably  common scheme was that of [[Pennsylvania]], passed in 1794: "Murder which  shall be perpetrated by means of [[poison]], or by lying in wait, or by any  other kind of willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, or which  shall be committed in the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate, any [[arson]], [[rape]], [[robbery]], or [[burglary]], shall be deemed murder of the  first degree (or capital murder in some states that carry the [[death penalty]]);  and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder of the second  degree."<ref>[http://www.lectlaw.com/def2/m150.htm Electronic Law Library definition]</ref> "Murder one", as  the term was popularized by [[novel]]s and [[television]], carried a penalty of death, or  life in prison, while the penalty for "murder two" was generally around  80 years in prison.

After the Supreme Court placed new requirements on  the imposition of the [[death penalty]],  most states adopted one of two schemes. In both, third degree murder  became the catch-all,  while first degree murder was split. The difference was whether some or  all first degree murders should be eligible for the most serious  penalty (generally death, but sometimes life in prison without the  possibility of [[parole]]).
* The first  scheme, used by [[Pennsylvania]]  and the most common<ref>http://weblinks.westlaw.com/result/Default.aspx?cite=NDC9536B034-2D11DA8A989-F4EECDB8638&db=1000262&findtype=VQ&fn=_top&ifm=NotSet&rlt=CLID_FQRLT5077219819192&rp=%2FSearch%2Fdefault.wl&rs=WEBL9.01&service=Find&spa=pac-1000&sr=TC&vr=2.0</ref>  among other states:
:#First Degree Murder: An intentional  killing by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of  willful, deliberate and premeditated action.
:#Second Degree  Murder: Homicide committed by an individual engaged as a principal or an  accomplice in the perpetration of a felony.
:#Third Degree  Murder: Any other murder (e.g. when the intent was not to kill, but to ''harm'' the victim).
* The second  scheme, used by [[New York]]  among other states:
:#First Degree Murder: Murder involving  special circumstances, such as murder of a police officer, judge,  fireman or witness to a crime; multiple murders; and torture or  especially heinous murders. Note that a "regular" premeditated murder,  absent such special circumstances, is not a first-degree murder;  murders by poison or "lying in wait" are not per se first-degree murders.  First degree murder is pre-meditated.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', N.Y.State Penal Law section 125.27,  found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS  N.Y. State Legislative web site (search for  Penal Law <U+00A7> 125.27)].</ref>   However, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] struck down the [[death penalty]]  as [[unconstitutional]]  in the case of ''[[People v. LaValle]]'', because of the statute's direction  on how the jury was to be instructed in case of deadlock in the penalty  phase.
:#Second  Degree Murder: Any premeditated murder or felony murder that does not  involve special circumstances.<ref>See,  ''e.g.'', N.Y. State Penal Law section 125.25,  found at [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS  N.Y. State Legislative web site (search for  Penal Law <U+00A7> 125.25)].</ref>

Schemes  similar to Pennsylvania's are used in California and Massachusetts. A  scheme similar to New York's is used in Texas, but first degree murder  is called "capital murder".

Other states use the term "capital  murder" for those offenses that merit death, and the term is often used  even in states whose statutes do not include the term. As of 2009, 35  states and the federal government have laws allowing capital punishment  for certain murders and related crimes (such as [[treason]], [[terrorism]], and [[espionage]]). The penalty is rarely asked for  and more rarely imposed, but it has generated tremendous public debate.  See also [[capital punishment]] and [[capital punishment in the United States]].

In death penalty-states with the  New-York  scheme, first degree murder itself is eligible for the death penalty. In  death penalty-states  with the Pennsylvania scheme, first-degree murder must involve an additional  aggravating factor for being eligible for the death penalty.

==Fetal homicide in the United States==
{{Main|Born alive  rule|Feticide}}
[[Image:Map of US, feticide laws.svg|thumb|260px|right|Fetal homicide laws in the United States {{legend|#02ffff;|"Homicide" or "murder".}} {{legend|#ffff00;|Other crime against fetus.}} {{legend|#c0c0c0;|Depends on age of fetus.}} {{legend|#00ff00;|Assaulting  mother.}}]]
Under the [[common law]], an assault on a pregnant woman  resulting in a [[stillbirth]]  was not considered murder; the child had to have breathed at least once  to be a ''human  being''. Remedies were limited to  criminal penalties for the assault on the mother and [[tort]] action for loss of the  anticipated economic services of the lost child and/or for emotional  pain and suffering. With the widespread adoption of laws against [[abortion]], the assailant could be charged  with that offense, but the penalty was often only a fine and a few days  in jail.

When the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]  greatly reduced laws prohibiting abortions in [[Roe v. Wade]] (1973) those sanctions became  harder to use. This meant that an assault which ensured that the baby  never breathed would result in a lesser charge. Various states passed  "fetal homicide" laws, making killing of an unborn child murder; the  laws differ about the stage of development at which the child is  protected. After several well-publicized cases, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]  passed the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]],  which specifically criminalizes harming a fetus, with the same penalties  as for a similar attack upon a person, when the attack would be a  federal offense. Most such attacks fall under state laws; for instance, [[Scott Peterson]]  was convicted of killing his unborn son as well as his wife under  California's pre-existing  fetal homicide law.
