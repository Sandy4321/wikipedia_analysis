"'''The Sweet Escape'''" is a [[pop music|pop]] song written by [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Akon]], and Giorgio Tuinfort for Stefani's second solo album ''[[The Sweet Escape]]'' (2006). Akon developed the song's [[beat (music)|beat]] before collaborating with Stefani. He designed it based on her previous work with [[No Doubt]], and Stefani later commented that it put her "on the [[yellow brick road]] to the No Doubt record I might do."<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1548004/20061214/rihanna.jhtml "For The Record: Quick News On Rihanna, Luda, Lady Sov, Kelis, Nas, Harry Potter, Angelina Jolie & More"]. [[MTV News]]. December 14, 2006. Retrieved December 25, 2006.</ref> "The Sweet Escape", which features elements of [[doo-wop]], [[Synthpop]], [[New Wave music|New Wave]], and [[ska]] music, is an apology for a fight between two lovers and describes a dream of a pleasant life for them. As the album's title track, its title was chosen to help market Stefani's music and fashion lines.

The song generally received positive reviews from contemporary music critics, though there was a negative response to Akon's presence as a featured artist. "The Sweet Escape" was released as the album's second [[single (music)|single]] in early 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]) and was commercially successful in mainstream and [[adult contemporary]] markets. It entered the top ten of most [[singles charts]] and topped the [[New Zealand Singles Chart]]. The song was nominated for [[Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]] at the [[50th Grammy Awards]]. In the song's accompanying [[music video]], Stefani attempts to escape from a golden prison.

"The Sweet Escape" is a pop song composed in the key of [[B-flat minor|B{{music|flat}} minor]].<ref name="sheet">Sheet music for "The Sweet Escape". Famous Music. 2007.</ref> The song mixes [[ska]], [[New Wave music|new wave]], [[disco]], and doo-wop sounds.<ref>Gottlieb, Jed. <!--Dead Link http://theedge.bostonherald.com/discReviews/view.bg?articleid=170322 Dead Link--> "Stefani's material leaves No Doubt she's new Madonna".

Retrieved August 18, 2007.</ref> It is written in [[compound meter (music)|compound quadruple meter]], commonly used in doo-wop, and has a moderate tempo of 120 [[beats per minute]]. Stefani's vocal range covers nearly two octaves, from G<sub>3</sub> to F<sub>5</sub>.<ref name="sheet"/>

The song uses two-[[bar (music)|measure]] [[phrase (music)|phrases]] that, aside from the choruses, use a i<U+2013>III<U+2013>IV<U+2013>VI [[chord progression]]. The B{{music|flat}} minor chord is held for 1<U+2153> of a beat, and a [[relative key|relative]] transformation is then used to produce a [[inversion (music)|second-inversion]] [[D-flat major|D{{music|flat}} major]] chord, which is held for 1<U+2154> of a beat. In the second measure, a first-inversion [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]] chord with an [[added tone chord|added]] ninth precedes a [[G flat major|G{{music|flat}} major]] [[major seventh|seventh]] chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.<ref name="sheet"/>

The song opens with an [[introduction (music)|introduction]] which consists of eight measures of instrumentals, followed by eight measures in which Akon sings "Woohoo, yeehoo". The introduction has been claimed to be similar to the one in the song Sweet Sweet Gwendoline by the [[Germany|German]] band [[Die <U+00C4>rzte]].<ref>http://www.kendallschoenrock.com/blog/2007/07/20/gwens-sweet-escape-from-jail-for-theft/</ref> [[Overdubbing]] is introduced in the middle of the first verse to produce a sequence of eighth note B{{music|flat}} minor chords from Stefani's vocals. Stefani's voice is overdubbed again when she sings the chorus twice. Akon performs, and Stefani then sings the second verse and the choruses again. She returns to the latter part of the first verse and repeats the choruses. The song closes as Akon repeats the lines "Woohoo, yeehoo" and "I want to get away to our sweet escape" as the song fades.<ref name="sheet"/>

"The Sweet Escape" generally received positive reviews from contemporary pop music critics. [[Allmusic]] described the song as "an irresistible <U+2026> track, driven by a giddy 'wee-oh!'
