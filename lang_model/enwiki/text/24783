During [[World War II]], Bagramyan was the first non-[[Slavic people|Slavic]] military officer to become a commander of a [[Front (Soviet Army)|Front]]. He was among several Armenians in the [[Soviet Army]] who held the highest proportion of high ranking officers in the Soviet military during the war.<ref>Jukes, Geoffrey. "Ivan Khristoferovich Bagramyan" in ''Stalin's Generals''. Harold Shukman (ed.) Phoenix, Arizona: Phoenix Press, 2001, p. 25. ISBN 1-8421-2513-3.</ref> 

Bagramyan's experience in military planning as a chief of staff allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander in the early stages of the Soviet counter-offensives against [[Nazi Germany]]. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942, and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the commanding officer (CO) of the [[1st Baltic Front]]. As the CO of the Baltic Front, he participated in the [[Baltic Offensive|offensives]] which moved westward and pushed [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] out of the [[Baltic republics]].

He did not immediately join the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] after the consolidation of the [[October Revolution]], becoming a member only in 1941, a move atypical for a Soviet military officer. After the war, he served as a deputy member of the [[Supreme Soviet]]s of the [[Latvian SSR|Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and was a regular attendee of the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congresses]]. In 1952, he became a candidate for entry into the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and, in 1961, was inducted as a full member. Outside Armenia, he is primarily known by the [[Russification|Russified]] version of his name, '''Ivan''' (or '''Ovannes''') '''Khristoforovich Bagramyan''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+0301><U+043D> <U+0425><U+0440><U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0444><U+043E><U+0301><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0411><U+0430><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+043C><U+044F><U+043D>}}). For his contributions during the war, he was widely regarded as a national hero in the Soviet Union,<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,925812,00.html Milestones]." ''[[TIME Magazine]]''. October 4, 1982. Retrieved May 2, 2007.</ref> and continues to hold such esteemed status among Armenians.

==Early life==
Hovhannes Bagramyan was born to Armenian parents in the village of [[<U+00C7>ardaql<U+0131>,_Shamkir|Chardakhlu]], near [[Yelizavetpol]], then a part of the [[Russian Empire]]. [[Hamazasp Babadjanyan]], a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home to take care of her seven children. Because his parents could not afford to send him to the local ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'', they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.<ref>{{hy icon}} Mnatsakanyan, Aramyis N. ''<U+0544><U+0561><U+0580><U+0577><U+0561><U+056C> <U+0532><U+0561><U+0572><U+0580><U+0561><U+0574><U+0575><U+0561><U+0576>, <U+053F><U+0575><U+0561><U+0576><U+0584><U+056B> <U+0587> <U+0533><U+0578><U+0580><U+056E><U+0578><U+0582><U+0576><U+0565><U+0578><U+0582><U+0569><U+0575><U+0561><U+0576> <U+0548><U+0582><U+0580><U+057E><U+0561><U+0563><U+056B><U+056E>'' (''Marshal Baghramyan: An Outline of His Life and Work''). Yerevan: Hayastan Publishing, 1978, p. 10.</ref>  

Graduating in 1912, Bagramyan, whom everyone affectionately called Vanya, followed his father and his brothers in a path in rail work, attending the  three-year railway technical institute in [[Tiflis]].<ref name="SovArm">{{hy icon}} Khaleyan, Yervand M. ''<U+0532><U+0561><U+0572><U+0580><U+0561><U+0574><U+0575><U+0561><U+0576>, <U+0540><U+0578><U+057E><U+0570><U+0561><U+0576><U+0576><U+0565><U+057D> <U+053D><U+0561><U+0579><U+0561><U+057F><U+0578><U+0582><U+0580><U+056B>'' (Baghramyan, Hovhannes Khachaturi). [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]. vol. ii. Yerevan: [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], 1976, p. 258.</ref> He graduated with honors and was slated to become a railway engineer within a few years when events in the [[First World War]] changed his life.

==World War I==
[[Image:Bagramyan 1916.jpg|thumb|left|A young Bagramyan in a photo taken in 1916 while he was serving in the [[Imperial Russian military]].]]
Bagramyan was well aware of the military situation in the [[Caucasian Front (WWI)|Caucasian Front]] during the first months of the world war. In the winter of 1914-15, the [[Imperial Russian Army]] was able to [[Battle of Sarikamish|withstand and repel]] the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s eastward advance, and to take the fight to its territory. Bagramyan also began reading harrowing reports in the Russian press of what was taking place against his fellow kinsmen across the border: the Ottomans had [[Armenian Genocide|embarked on their campaign]] to systematically annihilate their Armenian subjects. He desperately wished to join the military effort but because he was only seventeen and a railway mechanic, he was not liable to be drafted. This did not dissuade him from trying, as he later remarked, "My place was at the front."<ref>Mnatsakanyan. ''Marshal Baghramyan'', pp. 13-16.</ref> 

His opportunity came on September 16, 1915, when he was accepted by the Russian Army as a volunteer. He was placed in the 116th Reserve Battalion and sent to [[Akhaltsikhe]] for basic training. With his training complete in December, he joined the Second Caucasus Frontier Regiment of the [[Russian Caucasus Army|Russian Expedition Corps]], which was sent to dislodge the Ottoman Turks in Persia.<ref>Mnatsakanyan. ''Marshal Baghramyan'', p. 16.</ref> Bagramyan participated in several battles in [[Asadabad, Iran|Asadabad]], [[Hamedan]] and [[Kermanshah]], the Russian victories here sending Ottoman forces reeling towards Anatolia. 

Learning about the exploits of the men in the outfit, the chief of staff of the regiment, General Pavel Melik-Shahnazaryan, advised Bagramyan to return to Tiflis to enroll in the ''[[Praporshchik]]'' Military Academy.<ref>Mnatsakanyan. ''Marshal Baghramyan'', pp. 18-19.</ref> But in order to attend the school, Bagramyan needed to satisfy the academy's requirement of having completed school at a ''gymnasium''. This did not deter him and, after preparing for the courses in [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], he passed his exams and began attending the academy on February 13, 1917. He graduated in June 1917 and was assigned to the Third Armenian Infantry regiment stationed near [[Lake Urmia]].<ref>Mnatsakanyan. ''Marshal Baghramyan'', pp. 19-20.</ref> But with the overthrow of the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in the midst of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, his unit was demobilized. 

However, with the creation of the newly established [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] in 1918, Bagramyan enlisted in the Third Armenian Regiment of that country's [[Military history of Armenia|armed forces]].<ref name="SovArm"/> After the Ottoman Empire signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] (March 3, 1918) with the [[Russian SFSR]], from April 1, 1918 he was in the First Armenian Cavalry Regiment, which put a halt to the [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman 3rd Army]], which was bent on conquering the remains of the republic in the regions of Karaurgani, [[Sar<U+0131>kam<U+0131><U+015F>|Sarikamish]] and [[Kars Province|Kars]].<ref name="SovArm"/> He most notably participated in the May 1918 [[battle of Sardarapat]], where the Armenian military secured a crucial victory against Turkish forces. He remained in the regiment until May 1920.

==Interwar years==
[[Image:Bagramyan1938.jpg|thumb|150px|Bagramyan in 1938.]]
Three years after the toppling of the Provisional Government by the [[Bolshevik]]s in October 1917, the [[Red Army]] invaded the southern Caucasus republics of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]. In May 1920, Bagramyan, upset with the country's social and political conditions, participated in a failed rebellion against the [[Dashnak]]-led government of Armenia.<ref>Salisbury, Harrison E. ''The 900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad''. Cambridge: Da Capo Press, 2003, p. 112.

Accessed April 8, 2007.</ref> He was jailed and sent to work in the fields for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with the outbreak of the [[Turkish<U+2013>Armenian War]]. But in December 1920, Armenia was sovietized and the national army was subsequently disbanded.<ref>Mnatsakanyan. ''Marshal Baghramyan'', pp. 37-44.</ref> Bagramyan, however, chose to join the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Soviet Army]] and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander. 

As life in Armenia grew relatively more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought to locate a woman he had met several years earlier, Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in [[Nakhichevan]] with her family, had been married to an Armenian officer who had been killed during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who went on to become a painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.<ref>Mnatsakanyan. ''Marshal Baghramyan'', p. 47.</ref>

In 1923, Bagramyan was appointed commander of the Alexandropol Cavalry Regiment, a position he held until 1931. Two years later, Bagramyan graduated from the Leningrad Cavalry School and, in 1934, from the [[Frunze Military Academy]].<ref name="SovArm"/> In his memoirs, [[Pyotr Grigorenko]], a Ukrainian commander who attended Frunze, wrote about how Bagramyan was expelled from the academy by his superiors after they learned he had been a secret member of the banned Dashnak Armenian nationalist party for more than a decade. Pending his arrest, Grigorenko described Bagramyan "deeply depressed, saying he only wished they'd arrest him soon so that he could get it over with."<ref>Grigorenko, Pyotr. ''Memoirs''. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1984, p. 90 ISBN 0-3930-1570-X</ref> Grigorenko advised that he appeal the arrest warrant which Bagramyan reluctantly did and, with the help of Armenian [[politburo]] member [[Anastas Mikoyan]], the arrest warrant was revoked and he accepted to be "[[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]]."<ref>Wegner, Bernd ed. ''From Peace to War: Germany, Soviet Russia and the World, 1939<U+2013>1941''. Providence, RI: Berghahn Books, 1997 p. 402. ISBN 1-5718-1882-0.</ref> From 1934 to 1936, he served as the [[chief of staff]] of the 5th Cavalry Division, and from 1938, he worked as a senior instructor and lecturer at the Military Academy of the Soviet General Staff. Concurrently, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] had [[Great Purge|purged]] much of the Soviet officer corps of its veteran commanders. While fellow students from the military academy, [[Andrei Yeremenko]] and [[Georgy Zhukov]], had seen their careers rise, Bagramyan's had remained stagnant.<ref name="Jukes25">Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', p. 25.</ref>

In 1940, when General Zhukov was promoted to commander of the [[Kiev Military District]] in the Ukraine, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to be presented to the commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, ''Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation,'' apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet [[12th Army (Soviet Union)|12th Army]] based in the Ukraine.<ref name="Jukes25"/> Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a [[colonel]], was appointed deputy chief of staff of the [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]], headquartered in Kiev.<ref name="SovArm"/>

==World War II==
===Ukraine===
In June 1941, [[Nazi Germany]] violated the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the Soviet Union. Unlike many of the border troops who were caught off guard by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General [[Mikhail Kirponos]] believed an invasion by Germany was inevitable.<ref>Erickson, John. ''The Road to Stalingrad: Stalin's War with Germany, Volume One''. New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1999, p. 359. ISBN 0-3000-7812-9.</ref> However, Kipronos chose to ignore Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics like those used in the campaigns in [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|Poland]] in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940.<ref name="Jukes">Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', p. 26</ref> Since the winter of 1939<U+2013>40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine that was approved after numerous revisions on May 10, 1940.<ref>Salisbury. ''The 900 Days'', p. 71.</ref>

On the morning of June 22, he was tasked with the overseeing of a transfer of a military convoy to [[Ternopol]]. While his column was passing the Soviet [[airfield]]s near the city of [[Brody]], German air strikes hit the aircraft on the ground. Several hours later, they arrived in Ternopol, having been strafed twice by the planes.<ref>Salisbury. ''The 900 Days'', p. 73.</ref> Three days after the invasion, the plans for the counter-offensive were implemented, but disorder engulfed the troops, and the counter-attack collapsed.<ref>{{ru icon}} Bagramyan, Ivan K. ''<U+0422>ak <U+0428><U+043B><U+0438> M<U+044B> K <U+041F>o<U+0431>e<U+0434>e'' (''Thus We Went to Victory''). Moscow: Voenizdat, 1977 pp. 129<U+2013>130</ref> Bagramyan took part in the great tank battles in western Ukraine and the defensive [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|operation around Kiev]], in which Kirponos was killed and the entire Front captured by the Germans. He was one of a handful of senior officers who escaped from the encircled Front.

Bagramyan was then appointed chief of staff to Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and along with future Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], then a [[Political commissar|political officer]], coordinated the [[Battle of Rostov (1941)|fighting around Rostov]]. In his memoirs, Khrushchev described Bagramyan as a "very precise person who reported on everything just as it was. How many troops we had, their positions, and the general situation."<ref>Khrushchev, Nikita. ''Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev: Volume 1, Commissar (1918<U+2013>1945)''.

[[Image:Bagramyan&commanders.jpg|thumb|250px|Bagramyan, right, studying a battle map along with Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and political officer [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in early 1942.]]
Khrushchev went on to detail an account in where Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny]], sent by the chief of the operations department from the Soviet capital of [[Moscow]] to Kiev and representing the [[STAVKA]], courtmartialed Bagramyan,<ref>Khrushchev. ''Memoirs'', p. 321</ref> who protested and stated that if he was an incapable staff officer, then he should instead be given a field unit to command. To Bagramyan's astonishment, Budyonny went on to attempt to convince him to agree to his execution. Khrushchev remarked that the argument was essentially sparked arbitrarily and had taken place after an "abundant feast with cognac" and that "in those days we didn't take that kind of conversation seriously."<ref>Khrushchev. ''Memoirs'', pp. 321<U+2013>322.</ref> According to him, at the time however, the Soviet military was especially suspicious of the men in its ranks, itself judging that there were "[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]...everywhere, especially the Red Army."<ref>Khrushchev. ''Memoirs'', p. 317.</ref>

Bagramyan was instrumental in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Germans, including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the [[battle of Moscow]], and for this was promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant General]].<ref name="SovArm"/> In the same month, he was made the chief of staff of a military operations group that would oversee three Army Groups: the [[Soviet Southern Front|Southern]], the Southwestern and [[Bryansk]] Fronts.<ref name="Jukes"/> In March 1942, he went along with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter-offensive in the Ukrainian city of [[Kharkov]] to Stalin. Stalin, impressed with his plan, approved the operation and on April 8, promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Front. On May 12, 1942, armies of the Southwestern Front attacked Kharkov but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo [[Salient]], a region that German forces were near closing.<ref>Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', pp. 26<U+2013>27.</ref>

While Soviet forces were initially successful in [[Second Battle of Kharkov|recapturing Kharkov]], they found themselves trapped by the German army after the closing of Barvenkovo. On May 18, Bagramyan asked Timoshenko to alter the plans but Timoshenko along with Stalin refused to approve his request.<ref>{{hy icon}} Baghramyan, Hovhannes.

According to Khrushchev, Bagramyan was so devastated from the immense loss of men that after the operation was called off, "he burst into tears. His nerves cracked...He was weeping for our army."<ref>[[William Taubman|Taubman, William]]. ''Khrushchev: The Man and His Era''. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2003, p. 166.

''The Road to Stalingrad'', p. 359.</ref>

===The 16th Army===
Though he had never led a fighting unit prior to the war, he was given his first command of an army in the Western Front as his superiors, and particularly field marshal Zhukov were impressed with his skills and capabilities as a staff officer.<ref>Zaloga, Steven J. ''Bagration 1944 - The Destruction of Army Group Center''. New York: Osprey Publishing, 1996, p. 19 ISBN 1-8553-2478-4</ref> Zhukov, with the approval of STAVKA, appointed him commander of the [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th Army]] (2nd formation), (July 1942 - April 1943) replacing its former commander, [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] who had been sent to command the [[Bryansk Front]]. The 16th Army transferred its troops to the [[5th Army (Soviet Union)|5th Army]], and its command and staff were moved to the second echelon of the [[Western Front]] were the Army took up command of part of the [[10th Army (Soviet Union)|10th Army]]'s troops, and its defensive positions. On August 11, however, German forces mounted a surprise offensive on the southern flank of Western Front, splitting the 61st Army from the 16th Army which was not taking part in the Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive operation.<ref name="Jukes_2"/> The German forces threatened Bagramyan's left flank as he quickly moved his forces to counter their movements and halted them from advancing further on September 9.

With the rest of the Eastern Front battles almost entirely focused on [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and the Germans' attempts to advance to the [[Caucasus]], the 16th Army was not called up to action until February 1943. By then, the [[6th Army (Germany)|German 6th Army]] besieged in Stalingrad had been encircled and surrendered as Soviet forces remained on the constant offense. The 16th Army at the time was composed of four divisions and one infantry [[brigade]] and in light of the new offensive, Bagramyan's force was given two extra divisions, an [[infantry]] brigade, four [[tank]] brigades and several [[artillery]] regiments.<ref>Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref>

===Kursk===
As the battle of Stalingrad marked the turning point of the war, German forces reorganized for a new offensive in the summer of 1943 to attack the Soviet held [[Kursk]] salient in Russia. The German High Command was to utilize veteran units in its ambitions to destroy the salient, including the [[Ninth Army (Germany)|Ninth Army]] and the [[II SS Panzer Corps]].<ref>Newton, Steven H.

ISBN 0-3068-1150-2.</ref> STAVKA, already informed of the impending attacks, called for an advance towards the German defenses positioned near the town of [[Kozelsk]] which would push south where it would be aided by the armies of [[Soviet Central Front|Central Front]]. The forces would then proceed to cut off a {{convert|75|mi|km|sing=on}} gap that would effectively surround the Germans and cut if off from reinforcements. This was similar to the 1942 launched ''[[Operation Uranus]]'', where the Soviet army encircled and trapped the Sixth Army in Stalingrad.

Bagramyan's Eleventh Army was tasked to take part in the offensive and was given an additional three infantry divisions and two tank [[corps]], a force composed of fifteen divisions.<ref name="Jukes_3">Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', p. 28.</ref> Bagramyan however argued to STAVKA that its planning was too audacious in the hopes of repeating a successful encirclement like that in ''Uranus''. He claimed that his forces would be overstretched and would have difficulty in attacking the entrenched German positions in [[Bolkhov]]. To avoid a repetition of the failure in Kharkov the previous year, he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid the Eleventh in destroying the German forces in Bolkhov, thus eliminating the Ninth Army's protection from the north.<ref name="Jukes_3"/> He appealed to his front commander [[Vasily Sokolovsky]] as well the Bryansk's M. A. Reyter, both of whom rejected his proposal. In April, STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle. Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and Reyter, Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin, who agreed and approved that it would be the more correct course to follow.<ref name="Jukes_3"/> Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the Eleventh Army and on May 24 reported that his forces were ready. The Eleventh Army now was composed of 135,000 men, 280 [[armored fighting vehicle]]s, 2,700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces.<ref>Newton, Steven H.

Cambridge: Da Capo Press, 2005 p. 256 ISBN 0-3068-1399-8.</ref> Stalin, however, felt it necessary to further undermine the fighting abilities of the German forces and delayed the offensive.<ref>Erickson, John.

Ultimately, it was the German forces on who took the initiative by launching ''[[Operation Citadel]]'' on July 5 in the area around Kursk. German losses were initially heavy due to Soviet defensive preparations. Taking advantage of this, on July 12, Bagramyan's forces commenced their offensive, codenamed ''[[Operation Kutuzov]]'', and quickly breached through German defenses, advancing a distance of 45 miles (72&nbsp;km) by July 18.<ref name="Jukes_3"/> By July 28, the operation successfully concluded and he was promoted to the rank of [[Colonel-General]]. In the ensuing month, his forces took part in the large-scale tank offensives which effectively routed the German assaults and forced Germany to remain on the defensive for the remainder of the war.

===Belarus===
With the end of operations in Kursk, the Soviets began a series of offensives on various fronts to push the Germans out of the occupied Soviet republics. In October 1943, Bagramyan's Eleventh Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of [[Belarus]] and namely, the [[Baltic republics]]. In November, Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the [[First Baltic Front]] which had the similar objectives of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards.<ref name="Jukes_3"/>

Stalin would allow him to retain the Eleventh Army and suggested that Colonel-General [[N. E. Chibisov]], an officer he had served under, assume his position. Bagramyan however commented that he had had a frictional relationship with Chibisov and instead nominated [[Lieutenant-General]] K. N. Galitsky. Stalin, belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coherently coordinate together due to a conflict of holding the same rank, agreed to Bagramyan's suggestion and promoted him to the rank [[General of the Army (USSR)|Army General]].<ref name="Jukes_3"/> He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division that was taken from the Eleventh Army, thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies: the Eleventh, Thirty-ninth, Forty-third Guards and the Fourth Shock.<ref name="Jukes_3"/>

In the winter of 1943, his forces advanced forward towards the Belarusian city of [[Vitebsk]]. One of the key elements to Bagramyan's success was that many of the soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the [[Arctic]] regions of [[Siberia]],<ref name="TimeMag">{{cite news

Among the key locations imperative to reach Vitebsk was the small town of [[Gorodok]], serving as a communications hub that the Germans had heavily fortified. Despite the heavy defense preparations, Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the [[Red Air Force]] in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three-pronged attack from the ground.<ref name="TimeMag"/> The German garrison was overwhelmed, and by December 24, two infantry divisions and one tank division surrendered. In Moscow, the news of the victory at Gorodok prompted a 124 cannon salute in honor of Bagramyan and the First Baltic Front.<ref name="TimeMag"/>
[[Image:BagrationMap2.jpg|thumb|left|270px|General deployments of Soviet and German forces during ''[[Operation Bagration]]'' in June 1944.]]
On April 2, 1944 Stalin granted Bagramyan's request to relieve the troops of the Front of offensive duties. However, German forces took this to their advantage as they mounted a new offensive against [[Soviet partisan]] fighters in Belarus. Bagramyan's senior staff diverted air support and other crucial supplies to aid the partisans, allowing most of them to escape the German encirclement.<ref name="Jukes29">Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', p. 29.</ref> With the advance of Soviet forces in the Baltic and the Ukraine, German [[Army Group Center]] had largely been isolated as STAVKA prepared to eliminate the pocket (consisting of [[III Corps (Germany)|Third Panzer]], Second, Fourth, and Ninth Armies). STAVKA's plan, codenamed ''[[Operation Bagration]]'' was kept secret from all of the involved Front commanders. Bagramyan himself was only informed in May 1944 of his role in the offensive.<ref name=Jukes29/>

''Bagration'' called for the First, Second and Third Belarusian Fronts and the First Baltic to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the [[Daugava River]] and, along with Third Belarusian, clear the surrounding areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt the plans for the ''Bagration'' were sound, he worried about the possibility of a German incursion by [[Army Group North]] against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and [[Alexander Vasilevsky]], to have the First Baltic Front move westwards to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two.<ref>Erickson. ''The Road to Berlin'', p. 221</ref> Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on May 23 who formally approved it in a directive on May 31.

Although Bagramyan found it acceptable to sustain heavy casualties (as did all the commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining.<ref>Erickson. ''The Road to Berlin'', p. 225</ref> He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining the element of surprise in operations. In his preparations for ''Bagration'', he planned for the Forty-third army to move through the more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain.<ref name="Jukes_4">Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', p. 30.</ref> He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the Forty-third Army achieved success in its attack. Commander of the Forty-third Army, General A. P. Beloborodov wrote that during the offensive, they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.<ref name="Jukes_4"/>

As Bagramyan pushed towards Vitebsk, his forces were aided by the same Belarusian [[guerrilla]] fighters that had escaped the German encirclement in April. They provided vital intelligence, including information on the location of bridges and troop movements, and launched attacks against German logistics lines. On June 22, 1944, ''Bagration'' began as Bagramyan proceeded in moving westwards as previously planned. However, a widening gap on the Front's northern flank grew as it advanced while the Second Baltic Front, tasked to help defend that area, took no action.<ref name="Jukes_4"/> Stalin agreed to send a tank corps to reinforce Bagramyan's forces but ordered him to capture [[Polatsk]], which would sever Army Group North's communication lines and open up a route towards the central Baltic. By July 3, his troops had accomplished the tasks set forth in the directive, destroyed the Third Panzer Army and captured Polatsk.<ref name="Erickson">Erickson. ''The Road to Berlin'', p. 228</ref> For his achievements, on July 7 he was decorated with the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="SovArm"/>

===The Baltics===
[[Image:Vasilevski bagra.jpg|thumb|270px|Bagramyan conferring with Marshal [[Alexander Vasilevsky]] in 1945.]]
With the overall success of Soviet forces in ''Bagration'', his Front was expanded by three armies (although he ceded the Fourth Shock Army to Second Baltic), the Thirty-ninth army (previously under the command of Third Belarusian), the Fifty-first and the Second Guard Armies.<ref name="Jukes_4"/> The First Baltic Front was ordered by STAVKA to move westward in order to stop Army Group North's remaining forces from escaping to Germany. Despite this, Bagramyan understood that many of the general orders being given to the German Army were directed by [[Adolf Hitler]], rather than the General Staff and knew that while there was a possibility that they would confront them in the [[Lithuania]]n city of [[Kaunas]], he felt the more likely location would be in [[Latvia]]'s capital, [[Riga]].<ref name="Jukes_4"/> He spoke with Vasilevsky who agreed to change the plans if his theory and intuition proved correct.

As the First Baltic began moving towards Lithuania and into eastern Latvia, it became clear that Army Group North would attempt to outflank Bagramyan's forces near [[Daugavpils]], as he had previously predicted. Vasilevsky, keeping his promise, appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so.<ref name="Jukes_5">Jukes. ''Stalin's Generals'', p. 31</ref> Vasilevsky in turn, took it upon his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of the Fourth Shock Army, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised Thirty Ninth Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to the Fourth's ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he pressed on with the units he had.

By July 9, his ground forces had made significant gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders to attack the rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance.<ref>Erickson. ''The Road to Berlin'', p. 312</ref> At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most probably not going to easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia by the time of the offensive.<ref>Erickson. ''The Road to Berlin'', p. 315.</ref> He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of [[<U+0160>iauliai|Shaulyai]] to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.

With its capture, he persuaded Vasilevsky to allow his forces to move towards Riga, receiving a formal go-ahead by STAVKA in a directive on July 29. On July 30, his forces finally reached the seaside city of [[Tukums]], near the [[Bay of Riga]],<ref name="Erickson"/> thereby cutting off a total of 38 German infantry and armored divisions in Latvia.<ref name="SovArm"/> For his achievements in this battle, he was given the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. During the month of August, Soviet forces stalled in the Riga offensive, concentrating on halting German attacks. Finally on September 14, 1944, the First, Second and Third Baltic Fronts launched full scale offensives with the objective of Riga, encountering fierce resistance by its defenders. On September 24, with his forces only 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) from Riga, STAVKA ordered Bagramyan's forces to abandon it to the Second and Third Baltic Fronts, regroup, and instead advance against [[Klaip<U+0117>da|Memel]]. His forces [[Battle of Memel|attacked Memel]] on October 5 and on October 10, reached the city, effectively preventing Army Group North from retreating to Prussia.<ref name="Jukes_5"/>

In early 1945, Bagramyan's army, under the overall command of Vasilievsky, took part in the advance into [[East Prussia]]. In ''[[Battle of K<U+00F6>nigsberg|Operation Samland]]'', Bagramyan's First Baltic Front, now known as the [[Sambia|Samland]] Group, captured [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]]) in April. On May 9, 1945, he accepted the surrender of the [[Courland Pocket|German forces penned up in Latvia]], capturing a total of 158 aircraft, 18,000 vehicles, 500 tanks and assault guns among other weaponry.<ref name="Jukes_4"/>

==Career after World War II==
[[File:Bagramyan equestrian statue.JPG|thumb|250px|An equestrian statue of Marshal Bagramyan in [[Yerevan]], standing in front of the [[American University of Armenia]] and next to the British embassy.]]
After the war, Bagramyan remained in command of the [[Baltic Military District]], commanding operations against [[Forest Brothers|partisans in Lithuania and Latvia]]. In 1954, he was appointed Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense. In 1955, he was appointed [[Minister of Defence of Soviet Union|Deputy Minister of Defense]] with the rank of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="SovArm"/> He was also head of the Military Academy of General Staff and commander of the reserve forces of the Soviet Armed Forces.

He spent much of his time writing articles in military journals on Soviet strategic operations and most notably, co-authored the six-volume work on Soviet involvement during World War II, ''The Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War (1941<U+2013>1945)''.<ref name="SovArm"/> In August 1967, Bagramyan accompanied [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] to [[North Vietnam]], where they met with Vietnamese leaders as he, serving in the role of a military expert, helped negotiate the transfer of logistics and arms to the country during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Parker, F. Charles. ''Vietnam: Strategy for a Stalemate''. New York: Paragon House, 1989, p. 183. ISBN 0-8870-2041-0</ref>
[[Image:Marshal baghramyan.jpg|thumb|100px|The 100th anniversary of Marshal Bagramyan medal was established by the government of Armenia on May 11, 1997.]]
He retired in 1968. In 1971, Bagramyan completed his first volume of his memoirs in ''This is How the War Began'' in 1971 and in 1977, the second volume ''Thus We Went to Victory'' was published. Among the numerous points he noted in the second book was an analysis of the Red Army's costly offensives in the early stages of the war:

{{quotation|There is no point in hiding that before the war we mostly learned to attack, and did not pay enough attention to such an important manoeuvre as retreat. Now we have paid for this. It turned out that the commanders and the staff were not sufficiently prepared to prepare and execute the retreat manoeuvre. Now, in the second week of war, we had in fact to learn from the beginning the most difficult art - the art of the execution of retreat.<ref>Szawlowski, Richard. ''The System of the International Organizations of the Communist Countries''. Kluwer Law International, 1976, pp. 36-37. ISBN 9-0286-0335-2.</ref>}}

Marshal Bagramyan was awarded with numerous Soviet and foreign Orders and medals for his service including with two Orders of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], seven [[Orders of Lenin]], the [[Order of the October Revolution]], three [[Orders of the Red Banner]], two [[Orders of Suvorov]] and the [[Order of Kutuzov]]. Among the other commendations he received were the Polish ''[[Virtuti Militari]]'', the [[Medal For the Victory Over Germany]] and the [[Medal For the Victory Over Japan]].<ref name="SovArm"/>

After the death of Marshal [[Vasily Chuikov]] on March 18, 1982, he was the last Soviet Marshal who held a high command in World War II who remained alive. However, only several months later, Bagramyan died, on September 21, 1982, from illness at the age of 84, and was buried with full military honors at the [[Kremlin Wall Necropolis]] in Moscow.<ref>"[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C10FC3A5C0C778EDDA00894DA484D81 Ivan K.

==Notes==
{{Reflist|2|group="note"|refs=
<ref group="note" name="fn_1">Pronunciation: Bagramyan's name is most commonly written in English as ''Bagramyan'' "bahg-rahm-yahn" or ''Bagramian''. However, the [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian transcription]] of his name is ''Baghramyan.''
