The '''School of Oriental and African Studies''' (commonly abbreviated to "'''SOAS'''", pronounced ['s<U+0259>u<U+00E6>s] (so as) or ['s<U+0259>u<U+00E6>z] (so az)) is a constituent college of the [[University of London]], specialising in [[languages]], [[humanities]], [[economics]], [[law]] and [[politics]] concerning [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. SOAS currently offers over 300 undergraduate [[Bachelor's degree]] combinations, and over 70 one-year intensively taught [[Master's degree]]s. [[MPhil]] and [[PhD]] degrees are also available in every academic department.

Founded in 1916, SOAS has produced several heads of state, government ministers, ambassadors, Supreme Court judges, a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and many other notable leaders in [[emerging markets]], future [[superpowers]] and in the [[Next Eleven]]. Located in central [[London]], SOAS describes itself as the "world's leading centre for the study of a highly diverse range of subjects concerned with Asia, Africa and the Middle East", and is usually ranked amongst the top universities in the UK.[http://browse.guardian.co.uk/education?SearchBySubject=true&Subject=University+ranking&Institution=Soas&Go=Go][http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/single.htm?ipg=6524] 

==Background==
The institution was founded in 1916 as the '''School of [[Oriental Studies]]''' at 2 Finsbury Circus, [[London]], [[England]], the then premises of the London Institution. The School received its Royal Charter on [[5 June]] [[1916]]; admitted its first batch of students on 18 January; and was formally inaugurated by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] in the presence of the [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Earl Curzon of Kedleston]] among other cabinet officials just a month later on [[23 February]] [[1917]]. Africa was added to the school's name and remit in 1938 and the school permanently shifted to Thornhaugh Street, which runs between Malet Street and [[Russell Square]]. 

For sometime in the mid-1930s, the School was located at Vandon House, Vandon Street, London SW1. However, its move was held up by delays in construction and the half-completed building took a hit during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] in September 1940. The School was, on Government's advice, evacuated to [[Cambridge]] and returned to London to resume work in July 1940. Most colleges of the [[University of London]] were evacuated from London in 1939 and billeted on universities all over the provinces. SOAS was transferred, but without its library, to [[Christ's College]], Cambridge. When it became apparent that a return to London was possible, the School returned to the city and was temporarily housed for some months in 1940-41 in eleven rooms at Broadway Court, 8 [[Broadway, London|Broadway]], London SW1.

The institution's founding mission was primarily to train British administrators for overseas postings across the empire. Since then the school has grown into one of the world's most notable centres for the exclusive study of Asia and Africa.  A college of the [[University of London]], SOAS fields include [[Law]], Social Sciences, Humanities and Languages with special reference to Asia and Africa. SOAS consistently ranks among the top twenty universities in the UK league tables and in 2004 was ranked 44th in the world, 7th in the UK and 11th overall in Europe according to [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  The SOAS Library, housed in Philips Building (designed at the beginning of the 1970s by Sir [[Denys Lasdun]], and named after the then SOAS Director), is the UK's national resource for materials relating to Asia and Africa and is the largest of its kind in Europe.<ref>http://www.soas.ac.uk/library/about/</ref>

The School has grown considerably over the past thirty years, from under 1,000 students in the 1970s to over 4,500 students today, nearly half of them postgraduates. SOAS is partnered with the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales]] (INALCO) of [[Paris]]. INALCO is often considered the French equivalent of SOAS.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

==Campuses==
SOAS is currently split into two campuses within 20 minutes walk of each other. The Russell Square campus is located in [[Bloomsbury]], an area at the corner of the West End known to many tourists for its shops, theaters and nightlife. The main campus was moved there in 1938, and has much expanded since then. The closest [[London Underground|Underground]] station is [[Russell Square tube station]]. 

The '''Vernon Square campus''' in Islington was opened in 2001 is close to Kings Cross Station and is only a few hundred yards from Dinwiddy House and [[Paul Robeson House]] which are exclusive for SOAS students and are owned by Shaftesbury Student Housing.  

The school also houses the Brunei Gallery, completed in 1995, which stages temporary exhibitions of both historical and contemporary materials which reflect subjects and regions studied at SOAS. The school also hosted the  [[Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art]], one of the foremost collections of Chinese ceramics in Europe, however, as of April 2009 the collection has been loaned to and is now on public display in Room 95 of the [[British Museum]]. The present library building (by [[Sir Denys Lasdun]]) was added in 1973, the Brunei Gallery in 1995, and an extension to the library building opened in 2004 (the second phase of this expansion was completed in 2006).

The Centenary Masterplan conceives of the development of two new buildings, and a
substantial remodelling of existing space to realign and develop the entrance and two areas
within the Old Building. The cost estimates for the Centenary Masterplan settle at around
<U+00A3>73m for the total project. The full implementation of the School<U+2019>s Centenary Masterplan will deliver approximately 30%
additional space, approximately 1000 sq metres.

==Reputation==
In 2006, SOAS placed 5th among United Kingdom universities in a Guardian poll.<ref name = "Guardian Unlimited Education">{{cite web

</ref> In the subject tables of this poll, SOAS was placed 3rd for Anthropology, 4th for Economics, 3rd for History and History of Art, 6th for Law, 5th for Music, 3rd for Politics, and 3rd for Theology and Religious Studies.  The History Department obtained a rare 6 ''research'' rating in the last government assessment, placing it as only one of three departments in the country to achieve such a status.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The ''[[Times Higher Education]]''  world rankings place SOAS 44th in the world, 7th in the United Kingdom, and 11th in Europe. SOAS is also regarded for its focus on small group teaching with a student-staff ratio of only 11:1 and some departments 6:1(although postgraduate students have at times been used to fill in for academic staff).Also note that depending on subject area and module, classes are sometimes overcrowded and teaching hours short. SOAS currently features in the world's top 50 Universities for Arts & Humanities.[http://www.topuniversities.com/worlduniversityrankings/results/2007/subject_rankings/arts_humanities/]

The QS World University Rankings 2008 has listed SOAS Arts and Humanities as ranking 60 in the world, but overall ranked the School at 253. 

SOAS trains [[government officials]] on [[secondment]] from around the world in; Asian, African and Middle Eastern languages, especially in [[Arabic]] and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. It also acts as a consultant to several government departments and to companies such as [[Accenture]] and [[Deloitte]] - when they seek to gain specialist knowledge of the matters concerning [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/business/interface/clientlist/|title=Interface - Previous Client|publisher=School of Oriental and African Studies}}</ref>

SOAS has also has a reputation for attracting left-wing students and academics, although there is some debate over whether this is completely deserved.<ref>http://www.minoritystudents.co.uk/node/858</ref>

Most students in college or university accommodation are first-year [[undergraduate]]s. The majority of second, third and fourth-year students and [[postgraduate education|postgraduates]] live out.

A UNITE accommodation, named Elisabeth Croll House, is currently being built on the Vernon Square Campus, due to be completed in late 2009, availlable for students from September 2009.

==Students' Union==
{{main|SOAS Students' Union}}

SOAS has an active [[Students' Union]], which is seen among the students' movement to be radically left-wing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  In recent years the Students' Union has been particularly vocal in anti-war protests, and been active in reducing its carbon footprint. Recent campaigns by the union have involved campaigning for extended library opening hours, against closure of the ''Hindi'', and for higher pay for the SOAS cleaners and staff, to prevent further walk out strike action like the walk out in 2005. It has also gone through an environmental audit and has started to actively tackle environmental issues within its student union and in the university. Adopted motions are decided upon by vote at a [[Union General Meeting|UGM]], usually held at least twice a term.

The union elects three full-time co-presidents a year, who have separate responsibilities; and there are many part-time officers working with them who have specific briefs. Since a revision of the Union's constitution it has been possible for a Union General Meeting to elect an honorary president to serve a one-year term. The post has previously been held by former [[Mayor of London]] [[Ken Livingstone]] whilst the current Hon. President is Burmese political activist and SOAS alumna [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

==OpenAir Radio==
{{main|OpenAir Radio}}
SOAS runs its own radio station, OpenAir Radio, based on the 5th floor of the Russell Square Building. The initial [[Restricted Service Licence]] ran from November until [[16 December]] [[2005]], and broadcast on 101.4FM over a three mile radius in the Camden/Central London area. The remit of the station is world music, culture and current affairs, with programmes focusing on Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.  OpenAir programmes include everything from local news to international media analysis, and cookery programmes to DJ sets.

OpenAir is currently broadcasting over the internet and also providing shows as podcasts at [http://openair.fm/].
