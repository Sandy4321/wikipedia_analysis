'''South Jordan''' is a city located within the [[US state]] of [[Utah]]. It is part of the [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], Utah [[Salt Lake City metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Currently estimated at 51,131 people,<ref name="population2008">{{cite web | url=http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/files/SUB-EST2008-49.csv | title=2008 population estimate | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref> it is the [[List of cities in Utah (by population)|eleventh largest city]] in Utah and is located about {{convert|13|mi|km}} south of downtown Salt Lake City.  

The city was founded along the banks of the [[Jordan River (Utah) | Jordan River]] in 1859 by [[Mormon]] settlers.  An agrarian community for most of its history, today it has grown into a [[bedroom community]] of Salt Lake City. [[Kennecott Land]], a land development company, has recently begun construction on the master-planned [[Daybreak Community]] for the entire western half of South Jordan.  This community could potentially double South Jordan's population. 

[[Salt Lake County]] [[county fair | fair]] grounds and equestrian park are located in South Jordan  along with {{convert|67|acre|ha|adj=on}} Oquirrh Lake.  It is also the first city in the world with two [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS) temples ([[Jordan River Utah Temple]] and [[Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple]]).

==History==
===Pre-European===

The first known inhabitants were members of the Desert Archaic Culture who were nomadic hunter-gatherers.  From 400 A.D. to around 1350 A.D., the [[Fremont culture|Fremont people]] settled into villages and farmed corn and squash.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor-first=Kent | editor-last=Powell | url=http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/f/FREMONT%2CTHE.html | title=The Fremont | encyclopedia=Utah History Encyclopedia | year=1994 | publisher=University of Utah Press | location=Salt Lake City | isbn=978-0874804256 | accessdate=March 21, 2010}}</ref> The changing climatic conditions, combined with ancestors to the [[Ute Tribe | Ute]], [[Paiute]], and [[Shoshone]] pushing them out of the area, caused the Fremont people to disappear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madsen|2002|p=61}}</ref>  When European settlers arrived, there was no permanent [[Native_American_(Americas) | Native American]] settlements in South Jordan, but the area bordered several tribes <U+2013> the territory of the [[Northwestern Shoshone]] to the north,<ref>{{Harvnb|Madsen|1985|p=6-7}}</ref> the Timanogots band of the Utes to to the south in [[Utah Valley]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/ethnic_cultures/the_history_of_utahs_american_indians/chapter5.html | title=The Northern Utes of Utah | work=A History of Utah's American Indians | publisher=State of Utah | accessdate=March 11, 2010}}</ref>and the [[Goshute | Goshutes]] to the west in [[Tooele, Utah | Tooele]] Valley.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/people/ethnic_cultures/the_history_of_utahs_american_indians/chapter3.html | title=The Goshute Indians of Utah | work=A History of Utah's American Indians | publisher=State of Utah | accessdate=March 11, 2010}}</ref>

The only recorded trapper to lead a party through the area was [[<U+00C9>tienne Provost]], a French-Canadian who was lured into an Indian camp somewhere along the Jordan River north of Utah Lake. The people responsible for the attack were planning revenge against Provost's party for an earlier unexplained incident involving other trappers. Provost escaped, but his men were caught off-guard and fifteen of them were killed.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Alter | first=Cecil | title=Journal of W.A. Ferris 1830<U+2013>1835| journal=Utah Historical Quarterly | volume=9 | year=1941 | pages=105<U+2013>106}}</ref>

=== Early Mormon settlement ===

On July 22, 1847 the an advanced party of the first [[Mormon pioneers]] entered the valley and immediately began to irrigate land and explore the area for new settlements.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/facts/brief_history/mormonsettlement.html | title=Mormon Settlement | work=Utah History to Go | publisher=Utah State Historical Society | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}</ref>
Alexander Beckstead moved his family to the [[West Jordan, Utah | West Jordan]] area in 1849, and became the first blacksmith in the south Salt Lake Valley. He helped dig the first ditch to divert water from the Jordan River, powering [[Archibald Gardner | Archibald Garnder's]] flour mill.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bateman|1998|p=7}}</ref>  In 1859, Beckstead became the first settler of South Jordan by moving his family along the Jordan River, at near [[Street or road name#Salt Lake City | grid reference]] 9000 South, and lived in a dugout cut into the west bluffs above the river.  The Beckstead land extended from 9000 South to 12500 South, and from the Jordan River to about 1300 West.<ref name=UHE>{{cite encyclopedia | editor-first=Kent | editor-last=Powell | url=http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/s/SOUTHJORDAN.html | title=South Jordan | encyclopedia=Utah History Encyclopedia | year=1994 | publisher=University of Utah Press | location=Salt Lake City | isbn=978-0874804256 | accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  The [[flood plain]] of the Jordan was level, and could be cleared for farming if a ditch was constructed to divert river water along the base of the west bluff.  Beckstead and others created the {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} "Beckstead Ditch", that eventually stretched from 12500 South to 9000 South;<ref>{{Harvnb|Bateman|1998|p=8}}</ref> parts of the ditch are still in use today.

In 1863, the South Jordan [[Ward (LDS Church)#Branch | LDS Branch]] was organized as a branch of the West Jordan Ward, giving South Jordan its name.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor-first=Andrew | editor-last=Jensen | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/BYUIBooks&CISOPTR=2694&CISOSHOW=2693 | title=South Jordan Ward | encyclopedia=Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | year=1941 | publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company | location=Salt Lake City | page=816 | accessdate=March 17, 2010 }}</ref>  The Branch consisted of just nine families.  A school was built in 1864 out of [[adobe]] and measured just {{convert|14|ft|m}} by {{convert|18|ft|m}}.  The building also served as the LDS Meetinghouse for the South Jordan Branch.<ref name=HRecord>{{cite journal | first=Andrew | last=Jensen | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dLgUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA335&dq=south+jordan+utah&lr=&ei=pr-SS4iRBYiCNomqnPsM&cd=20#v=onepage&q=south%20jordan%20utah&f=false | title=South Jordan Ward | journal=The Historical Record: A monthly periodical, devoted exclusively to historical, biographical, chronological and statistical matters. | volume=5 | page=335 | date=1889 | accessdate=March 21, 2010}}</ref>

As South Jordan grew, a new and larger building was constructed on the east side of the current cemetery site in 1873.  It had an upper and lower entrance with a granite foundation using left-over materials brought from the [[granite]] quarry at the mouth of [[Little Cottonwood Canyon]].  The upper story was made of over-sized adobe bricks.<ref name=HRecord />  The main hall had curtains which could be pulled to section off the hall for classes. The meetinghouse also served as the "ward" school when it was held during the fall and winter months.  It came to be known as the "Mud Temple".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bateman|1998|p=153}}</ref>  The building was used until 1908 when South Jordan Ward moved into a new building.

In 1876, work was completed on the South Jordan Canal which took water out of the Jordan River in [[Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale]] and bought it above the river bluffs for the first time.<ref name=UHE />  This canal parallels 1300 West and in time joined the North Jordan Canal in [[Taylorsville, Utah|Taylorsville]].  As a result, most of the families moved up away from the river onto the "flats" above the river which they could now irrigate.  In 1881, The Utah and Salt Lake Canal was completed.  The canal parallels the west side of today's [[Redwood Road]].  With the completion of the canal system, greater acreage could be farmed, thus increasing the area's population.<ref name=HRecord />

=== Twentieth century ===

In the late 1890s, a new crop was introduced in South Jordan.  [[Alfalfa]] hay took the place of the tougher native grasses which had been used up to that point for feed for livestock.  Alfalfa had to be irrigated and in good years three crops could be cut and stored.  [[Sugar beets]] were introduced to South Jordan around 1910. Farmer liked sugar beets because they could be sold for cash at the Utah&ndash;[[Idaho]] sugar factory in West Jordan.  Older residents can remember the beet dump at Redwood and 10400 South where the beets were weighed and then taken to the sugar factory in West Jordan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bateman|1998|p=24}}</ref>  Sugar beet farming became so integral to the region, that the region's high school ([[Jordan High School (Sandy, Utah) |Jordan High School]]) mascot was named the "beetdigger". 

A big celebration was held on January 14, 1914, to commemorate the arrival of electrical power, the addition of a water tank and supply system for indoor plumping and a new park for South Jordan.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul-kAQHnToC&dat=19140117&printsec=frontpage | title=Big Celebration at South Jordan | publisher=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=January 17, 1914 | accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>  The city needed a water tank to store water for residents living along Redwood Road.  The only way to get a federal grant was to [[municipal corporation | incorporate]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/179936/COMMUNITY-PROFILE--SOUTH-JORDAN.html | title=Community Profile: South Jordan | publisher=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=August 26, 1991 | accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>  Citizens voted to incorporate on November 8, 1935, and immediately issued bonds to get money for the water tank.  The city was governed by a Town Board with responsibilities over parks, water and later the cemetery.  In 1978, the city moved to a [[mayor-council]] form of government and assumed local supervision of police, fire, road and building inspections from [[Salt Lake County]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=x4MOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-X8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6124,7325366&dq=south+jordan&hl=en | title=South Jordan in transition period | publisher=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=September 27, 1978 | accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0oMOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9n8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6048,2308888&dq=south+jordan&hl=en | title=Riverton police chief want to keep out of politics | publisher=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=August 9, 1978 | accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>

Starting in the in 1970's, Salt Lake County and South Jordan underwent urbanization.  Salt Lake County had {{convert|489,000|acre|ha}} devoted to farming in 1950,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/Historical_Publications/1950/vol%201%20Utah%20Nevada/34065055v1p31ch2.pdf | title=Statistics for Counties | work=1950 Census of Agriculture | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | format=PDF | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> by 1992, it had decreased to {{convert|108,000|acre|ha}}<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/1992/Volume_1_Chapter_2_County_Tables/Utah/ut2_01.pdf | title=County Summary Highlights: 1992 | work=1992 Census of Agriculture | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | format=PDF | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref>  As a result, South Jordan's economy went from agrarian to being a  [[bedroom community]] of Salt Lake City.  South Jordan's population received another boost when Kennecott Land began an enormous development called Daybreak in 2004.  It is a {{convert|4,000|acre|ha|adj=on}} planned community that will contain more than 20,000 homes and includes commercial and retail space.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705325307/Bench-mark-Mogul-of-Daybreak-aims-to-shape-western-Salt-Lake-Valleys-future.html | title=Bench mark: Mogul of Daybreak aims to shape western Salt Lake Valley's future | newspaper=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=August 22, 2009 | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref>  South Jordan became the only city in the world with two LDS temples when the [[Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple]], located in the Daybreak Community, joined the [[Jordan River Utah Temple]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/oquirrhmountain/ | title=Oquirrh Mountain Utah Temple | work=Temples | publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | accessdate=March 29, 2009}}</ref>

===Bus crash===

The worst railroad crossing crash in United States history occurred on Thursday, December 1, 1938, at approximately 9:00&nbsp;am.  A bus loaded with 38 students from South Jordan, Riverton, and Bluffdale crossed in front of an oncoming train obscured by fog and snow. The bus was broadsided killing the bus driver and 23 students.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aYUbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=NU4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=1273,590460&dq=south+jordan+bus+crash&hl=en | title=Casualty Toll in Bus Tragedy Mounts to 24 | newspaper=Pittsburgh Press | date=December 2, 1938 | accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=18IcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6lYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6924,3646677&dq=south+jordan+bus+crash&hl=en | title=New Crash Death Boosts Bus-Train Fatalities To 23 | newspaper=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=December 2, 1938 | accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>
The concern about bus safety led to changes in state and eventually federal law mandating that buses stop and open the doors before proceeding into a railroad crossing.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705338209/Bus-crash-in-1938-led-to-train-laws.html | title=Bus crash in 1938 led to train laws | newspaper=Deseret News | location=Salt Lake City | date=October 20, 2009 | accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>

The same railroad crossing was the site of many other crashes in the following years. The main reason was that the road ran parallel on the west side of the railroad tracks, made a short bend of {{convert|100|ft|m}}  to cross the tracks and continued running parallel on the east side of the tracks.  The last deadly crash occurred on December 31, 1995, when three teens died while crossing the tracks in their car.<ref>{{cite news | title=New Year's Wrecks Kill Six, Including 3 in Train Collision | newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune | location=Salt Lake City | date=January 2, 2006 | accessdate=March 19, 2010}}</ref>  The crossing was finally closed, but not until crashes occurred in 1997<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/574959/Caption-Only--S-Jordan-driver-walks-away-from-train-wreck.html | title=S.
