'''''Heart to Yours''''' is the first solo album by [[United States|American]] singer [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]]. Released on April 16, 2002, by [[Sanctuary Records|Sanctuary]] and [[Columbia Records]] it became the first solo release of any [[Destiny's Child]] member. Production of the album began in 2001, with Williams working with an array of producers, including her brother Erron Williams (who produced the title track), HR Crump and [[Warryn Campbell]]. ''Heart to Yours'' is primarily a [[Urban contemporary gospel|contemporary gospel]] album, however it heavily incorporates elements of many other styles and genres such as; [[neo-soul]], [[Inspirational music|inspirational]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and even [[Rock music|rock]] music. The album's lyrical content and subject matter is also diverse and ranges from songs that glorify and [[praise]] [[God]] to tributes dedicated to the victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the [[United States]], which encourage those suffering in the aftermath of the attacks that the "sun will shine again".

Receiving generally positive reviews from critics, ''Heart to Yours'' peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' Gospel Albums]] chart with nearly 20,000 copies sold in one week, eventually becoming 2002's biggest selling album of the that genre in the U.S, selling over 203,000 copies.<ref name "NY Times"/> The album was also a success on another ''Billboard'' component chart, the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, where it peaked within the top 20 at number fifteen. However, the album failed to make as big of an impact on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] as the debuts of Williams' bandmates, peaking at a moderate firty-seven.

==Background and production==
In late 2000, while recording their third album, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'', [[Destiny's Child]] revealed that they would produce solo albums, although no signed deals had yet been made.<ref>{{Cite news |last=vanHorn |first=Teri |title=Destiny's Child Solo CDs Won't Compete With Group, Each Other |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1375022/20001208/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2000-12-08 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref> After the release of ''Survivor'', the group announced in late 2001 a temporary break-up to focus on solo projects, including working on their own albums.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |title=Destiny's Child's Long Road To Fame (The Song Isn't Called 'Survivor' For Nothing) |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1504044/20050613/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2005-06-13 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref> Before undertaking their respective solo projects, the group released a Christmas album, ''[[8 Days of Christmas]]''.

Williams worked in the studio with several musical collaborators, including Scott <U+201C>Shavoni<U+201D> Parker, Damon Elliott, Warren Campbell and [[gospel music|gospel]] producer HR Crump. Williams' brother, Erron Williams, also produced some of the tracks on the album. Williams also co-wrote five of the songs.<ref name="Moss">{{Cite news |last=Moss |first=Corey |title=Destiny's Child Solo Gospel Album Features 9/11 Tribute |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452910/20020315/story.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2002-03-15 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>

==Content and composition==
Generally, the album comprises of [[Urban contemporary gospel|urban contemporary gospel music]] containing elements of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[neo-soul]] and [[traditional black gospel music]], with inspirational lyrics about building, maintaining and appreciating a relationship with [[God]] which also encourage the listener that "everything is going work out fine". The album's lead single, "Heard a Word", sums up the theme of the album, with its chorus: "I heard a word / Saying girl, you'll be fine / I heard a word that would ease my troubled mind / Took all the hurt away / Warmed me up inside like a summer day / So glad that you'd never break your promises". Other songs are tributes to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States; "Better Place", written by Michelle Williams, Damon Elliott and Kayla Parker, is one such example which was inspired by the catastrophic event and is an emotional tribute to those who lost loved ones who died in the attack.<ref name="Moss"/>

The album features guest vocals by various artists, including Williams' Destiny's Child band mates - [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] - on "Gospel Medley" (originally produced for the group's 2001 album, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'') which consists of an interpolation of [[Kirk Franklin]]'s "Holy is the Lamb", the popular Anna B. Warner [[hymn]] "Jesus Loves Me" and concludes with the famous final section of [[Richard Smallwood]]'s "Total Praise". Other guests include [[Carl Thomas (singer)|Carl Thomas]] on a remixed version of the [[BeBe & CeCe Winans]] classic, "Heaven",<ref name="Hopkins"/> (featured as a bonus track on the album); [[Men of Standard]]'s Isaac Carree and Lowell C. Pye on "You Care for Me"; [[Mary Mary]] on "So Glad"; and [[Shirley Caesar]] on "Steal Away to Jesus",<ref name="Moss"/> which was herladed by most critics as "the album's high point"<ref name="Allmusic"/> and was first included on Caesar's 2001 album, ''Hymns''.<ref name="vanHorn">{{Cite news |last=vanHorn |first=Teri |title=Independent Women Of Destiny's Child Coordinate Solo Projects |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449919/20011011/destinys_child.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2001-10-11 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>

==Release==
While her musical cohorts were finishing their projects, Williams' management strategically planned a successive release of their albums to avoid "rivalry" on the charts.<ref name="vanHorn"/> Over a period of one year, Williams released ''Heart to Yours'' on April 16, 2002, in the United States,<ref name="Moss"/> ahead of [[Kelly Rowland]]'s 2002 album, ''[[Simply Deep]]'' and [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]' 2003 ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' - all debut releases.

''Heart to Yours'' received generally positive reviews from critics. William Ruhlmann of ''[[Allmusic]]'' complimented the non-hasty production of the album, noting that "there are different producers on nearly every track, and the arrangements for the most part are state-of-the-art urban contemporary efforts". Ruhlmann also described Williams' voice as "warm" and "kittenish" before writing that "by the time Williams is trading lines with Isaac Carree and Lowell Pye of Men of Standard" she "has transformed herself from kitten to tiger, belting out the words with absolute conviction".<ref name="Allmusic"/> ''GospelCity.com'' also praised "Michelle's delicate vocals" - particularly on "You Care For Me" where Williams' "soulful chops" are said to "shine through brilliantly" - and noted that on "Heard A Word", Williams "demonstrates further versatility in [[Ella Fitzgerald|Ella]]-like fashion", concluding the review by describing ''Heart to Yours'' as a "melodically pleasant, lyrically sound gospel project".<ref name="GospelCity">{{Cite news|title=Michelle Williams - Heart To Yours|url=http://www.gospelcity.com/music/reviews/91/Page2|work=GospelCity.com|date=2002|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' also described Williams' voice was "warm", describing it as recalling "the playful wisps of her R&B contemporaries ([[Jill Scott]], [[Erykah Badu]]) and the breathy timbre of [[Diana Ross]]". Cinquemani then described the album as being "a mix of slick hip-hop-style beats, inspirational themes and catchy, pop-friendly hooks" with "admirable", "largely restrained arrangements", lending particular praise to the "surprisingly eloquent (and non-denominational) sentiment" that is featured within the lyrics of the album's title track ("Heart to Yours").<ref name="Slant">{{Cite news |last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|title=Michelle Williams: Heart to Yours|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/michelle-williams-heart-to-yours/202|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2001-10-11|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref> Tracy Hopkins of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine gave the least favorable review however, stating that despite Williams' collaborations with contemporary gospel singers, the album "only reinforce the thin-piped vocalist's shortcomings". Hopkins also wrote that although Williams "is in the right place", her vocals are "too quiet" and the production is too "tame to start a real Holy Ghost party".<ref name="Hopkins"/> On the contrary, Mike Rimmer of ''[[Cross Rhythms]]'' gave a very favorable review of the album (10/10), describing "the quality" as being "superb throughout" and "Michelle's soulful laid back vocals" as being "delicious throughout".<ref name="Cross Rhythms">{{Cite news |last=Rimmer|first=Mike|title=Michelle Williams - Heart to Yours|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Michelle_Williams/Heart_To_Yours/5121/|work=[[Cross Rhythms]]|date=Monday, May 13, 2002|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}</ref>

===Commercial reception===
Although ''Heart to Yours'' failed to dominate the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it gained success on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' components charts. The album entered the ''Billboard'' Top Gospel Albums chart at number one. With combined chart success after peaking at number three on the ''Billboard'' Top Contemporary Christian Albums, ''Heart to Yours'' became 2002's top-selling gospel album.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Music World/Columbia Records Set to Release 'Unexpected,' the New Full-Length Studio Album From Grammy-Winning Musical Artist Michelle Williams |url=http://www.forbes.com/prnewswire/feeds/prnewswire/2008/04/01/prnewswire200804020001PR_NEWS_USPR_____NYW052.html |work=PR Newswire |publisher=Forbes |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2008-04-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> On the main album chart in the U.S., the ''Billboard''&nbsp;200, the album reached number fifty-seven on May 4, 2002.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Michelle Williams: Heart to Yours |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/discography/index.jsp?pid=319481&aid=530489 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |accessdate=2008-04-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Heart to Yours'' sold 203,000 domestically.<ref name "NY Times">{{Cite web |last=Ogunnaike |first=Lola |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>'s Second Date With Destiny's Child |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/arts/music/14ogun.html |work=The New York Times |date=2004-11-14 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>
