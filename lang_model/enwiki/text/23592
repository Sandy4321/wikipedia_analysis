'''''Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor''''' is the name of [[Lupe Fiasco]]'s critically-acclaimed debut album, released on [[September 19]], [[2006]]. 

The album features production from the likes of [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Kanye West]], [[Mike Shinoda]], [[Craig Kallman]], [[Needlz]], Soundtrakk, Prolyfic, and Brandon Howard. [[Jay-Z]], [[Chill]], and Lupe Fiasco himself are credited as the executive producers for the album.

Originally, the album was recorded to have debuted at #12 on the [[Billboard 200]]; however, due to incomplete [[Nielsen Soundscan]] reports, the album actually debuted at #8.<ref>{{cite news | title = "Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor" A Smash Debut | publisher = Static Multimedia | url = http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/music/news/news_1159572123?info=music | accessdate = 2007-05-22 }}</ref>

The first international single off the album was "[[Kick, Push]]". The song stated Lupe's love for skateboarding. The second single in Europe was "[[Daydreamin']]" (featuring [[Jill Scott]]) which features a sample of [[I Monster]]'s "Daydream in Blue". The second single in the U.S. (and the third international single) was "[[I Gotcha]]" which is produced by The Neptunes.

The song's video was featured on [[MTV]]'s "[[Making the Video]]". Lupe recently held a poll on his MySpace profile, where fans were able to vote for which song they wanted to be made into a music video.<ref>{{cite news | title = Lupe Fiaso - The Instrumental (Behind the Scenes)| publisher = HipHopDX| date = [[2007-04-30]] | url = http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/videos/id.136/title.lupe-fiaso-the-instrumental-behind-the-scenes | accessdate = 2007-05-22}}</ref> 

The album was nominated for [[Best Rap Album]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 2007|2007 Grammy Awards]].

He was named by several people as the potential "savior of Hip-Hop."<ref>{{cite news | last = Hal | first = Andreas | title = Album Reviews: Lupe Fiasco - Food & Liquor | publisher = HipHopDX | date = [[2006-09-20]] | url = http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.693/title.lupe-fiasco-food-liquor | accessdate = 2007-05-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = The Rise and Fall of Lupe Fiasco | publisher = hiphopmusic.com | date = [[2006-10-17]] | url = http://www.hiphopmusic.com/archives/002062.html | accessdate = 2007-05-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Baber | first = Anthony | title = Fiasco kicks, pushes his way to the top of the rap game | publisher = Michigan Daily | date = [[2006-09-09]] | url = http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2006/09/19/Music/Taste.Of.Chicago-2284369.shtml

===Title origin===
The title of the album refers to the vast amounts of Food and Liquor stores that exist in [[Chicago]], which is his hometown. The title is also a philosophy that Lupe believes about human nature and he goes on to elaborate:
{{cquote|In Chicago, instead of having bodegas like in New York, the majority of the corner stores are called 'Food and Liquors.' The store is where everything is at, whether it be the wine-o hanging by the store, or us as kids going back and forth to the store to buy something. The 'Food' is the good part and the 'Liquor' is the bad part. I try to balance out both parts of me.<ref>{{cite news | title = Lupe Fiaso Biography| publisher = LupeFiasco.com | url = http://www.lupefiasco.com/ | accessdate = 2007-05-22 }}</ref>|cquote}}

===Album leak===
Earlier in 2006, the album was leaked twice: in March 2006 and May 2006. However Lupe stated that he would still release the album with new and revised tracks. "Hey shit happens. An unmixed version of Food & Liquor got leaked yesterday," Lupe said. "It's stuff like this that makes you wanna just be like, forget it."<ref>{{cite news | title = Lupe Fiasco Addresses 'Food & Liquor' Album Leak | publisher = nobodysmiling | url = http://www.nobodysmiling.com/hiphop/news/86052.php | accessdate = 2007-05-22 }}</ref> The proper retail version of the album leaked on [[September 11]], [[2006]].

==Content==
===Subject matter===
Fiasco covers a wide variety of subjects on the album. "[[Kick, Push]]" tells the story of a young skateboarder. The lyrics follow the skateboarder through many stages of his life such as his childhood, finding love, marriage, and adulthood. On ''"The Instrumental"'' Lupe talks about how people are addicted to boxes (TV). The boxes stands for a [[TV]] or a [[Computer]]. ''"He Say She Say"'' deals with the story of a child without a good father-figure and the effects that it has on the child. ''"The Cool"'' follows the story of a dead man who comes to life who rises from the graves. ''"[[Hurt Me Soul (Song)|Hurt Me Soul]]"'' deals with Lupe's conflicting feelings about Hip-Hop, stating in the lyrics ''"I used to hate hip-hop. Yup, because the women degraded. But [[Too $hort]] made me laugh, like a hypocrite I played it"''. He even references Jay-Z's (who is an excutive producer of the album) line ''"I don't pray to god. I pray to [[John Gotti|Gotti]]"'' on D'evils. The chorus features Lupe rapping from the perspective of various people who tell their problems in the world. On ''"American Terrorist"'', Lupe discusses his Muslim religion and racial profiling. The album ends with Lupe reading a list of people who helped with the album (similar to that of "My 1st Song" by Jay-Z and "Last Call" by Kanye West).

===Production===
''Food & Liquor'' was handled by a variety of different producers some lesser-known such as Soundtrakk, [[Needlz]] and [[Craig Kallman]]. While also having tracks produced by well-known producers such as [[Kanye West]], [[Mike Shinoda]] and [[The Neptunes]]. On ''"Kick, Push"'', Soundtrakk provided lush strings and horns as the backdrop. Strings are prominent through the album particularly on songs such as ''"Hurt Me Soul"'', ''"He Say She Say"'', and ''"Daydreamin'"''. ''"Daydreamin'"'' contains a sample of the well-known song ''"Daydream in Blue"'' by [[I Monster]] as the chorus. ''"American Terrorist"'' contains a middle-eastern style beat provided by Prolyfic. The Neptunes provided a more synth and keyboard based beat on ''"I Gotcha"''. Brandon Howard provides a lush piano loop on ''"Kick, Push II"''.<ref>{{cite news | title = ALBUMS :: Food And Liquor | publisher = ProdBy: The Net #1 Source For Hip Hop Productions and Discographies | url = http://prodby.altervista.org/album_list.php?album=Food%20And%20Liquor | accessdate = 2007-05-22 }}</ref>
