System under which an '''ISKCON guru''' is permitted to initiate disciples in the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] has undergone a considerable evolution and reform since it's beginnings in 1970s. [[Upanayana]] as a traditional  "sacred thread ceremony" of the [[Gayatri Mantra]], commonly known Hindu [[Sanskara]], is complimented by [[Pa<U+00F1>caratra|Pancaratric mantras]] of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] [[sampradaya]] and follows the principal initial [[N<U+0101>ma|nama]] initiation ceremony, refereed respectively as ''[[brahmana]] [[diksa]]'' and ''nama diksa''.

==Etymology==
ISKCON [[Gaudiya Vaishnavas]] often refer to lexicons of [[Amarakosha|Amarako<U+015B>a]] [[thesaurus]] of [[Sanskrit]] for meanings of words and according to the writings of the Gaudiya acaryas, the word guru is very often defined as one who teaches [[sastra]] or holy scripture. This definition of a wider concept of [[guru]] in [[Hinduism]] links the question of the relative authority of the guru<U+2019>s words and those of the sastra in a crucial relationship. Baladeva Vidyabhushana, 18th century principal Gaudiya  theologian used and defined guru in his commentaries on [[Brahma Sutras|Vedanta-sutra]]. Specifically, in the comments to the ''sutras'' 3.3.44-45 [[Baladeva Vidyabhushana]] argues that the concept of guru<U+2019>s grace plays the central role in the system of [[Guru-shishya tradition|teacher-student succession]].

==Philosophy==

[[File:Prabhupada paintings.jpg|thumb|400px| Images on the dome of the [[samadhi]] of [[Prabhupada]], pre-eminent siksa guru to all [[ISKCON]] devotees.]]

Scriptural evidence towards the issue of a guru lies mainly in a large volume of  [[Sanskrit]] work named Hari Bhakti Vilasa which received commentary by [[Sanatana Gosvami]] is the foundation of the traditional philosophy and has 9.275 verses, divided in twenty chapters (Vilasas). First chapter is dedicated to guru, with second dedicated to ritual process of initiation by the guru. The worship of guru is described towards the end of the third ''vilasa''. <ref name=asgood/>

The place of guru and his grace (''prasada'') plays a vital role in the Vaisnava traditions in general and in [[ISKCON]] Gaudiya Vaishnavism in particular. The generic view on a [[guru]] as a representative of God is a central feature to the tradition and philosophy: {{quote|God and the soul combine in their own ways within the archetype of the spiritual guide. For both, the spiritual master is a type of extraordinary confluence of divinity and humanity, as each tradition exalts ways in which the guide becomes directly and effectively the grace of God in the flesh.|Graham M. Schweig}}
In contrast with established traditional view of ISKCON some rare [[Vaishnava-Sahajiya|sahajia]] groups in [[West Bengal|Bengal]] treat their own preceptor (guru) as the living [[God]].<ref>Pratibharanjan Maitra (ed.), ''Mursidabad carca''. Khagra/Baharampur/Mursidabad: Mursidabad Carca Kendra, 1395 (Beng. Era), pp. 93-122.</ref> The view that is different or contrasted to the concept of a guru being "as good as God".<ref name=asgood>M<U+00E5>ns Broo: As Good as God. The Guru in Gaudiya Vaisnavism.

The question of qualification and humility remained opened for generations prior to creation of ISKCON in the west. In his speech ''Assuming Responsibility of Being Guru'' [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]], who founded the popular branch of the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] tradition that resulted in creation of [[ISKCON]], underlined the contrast of humility and responsibility of the performance of the duties of being a guru. {{quote|"He whose only teaching is humility greater than that of a blade of grass ([[Caitanya Mahaprabhu]]), said: "By My command being guru save this land!" In this instance Mahaprabhu Himself has given the command. His command being "Perform the duty of the guru, even as I do it Myself. Also convey this command to whom-so-ever you chance to meet."|Sarasvati. [http://surrealist.org/pdf/assuming_responsibility.pdf 1934]}}

It has been seen that much of the debate over authority and continuity over the years has focused on one issue: namely, whether current GBC members and gurus are spiritually qualified.<ref name="tkg"/><ref>See also:<U+2018>''Leader Misconduct, Religious Authority, and the Development of the Hare Krishna Movement'',<U+2019> in Anson Shupe, ed, ''Wolves Among the Fold''. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1997</ref> Guru in a post-charismatic phase of [[ISKCON]] is a subject of number studies and debates.

==Parallel lines of authority==

ISKCON is seen as an extension of the Gaudiya-Vaishnava tradition and thus participates in the disciplic succession from [[Caitanya Mahaprabhu]]. In most Indic  traditions spiritual authority rests in one person, or [[acharya]], head of a monastery or a whole [[sampradaya]]. ISKCON is sometimes described as the "first global Vaisnava movement" is different. ISKCON is a multi-guru organisation that places the ultimate managerial authority in its Governing Body, a group rather than a single person. Current '''ISKCON Guru System''' is developed by the group of leaders, Governing Body Commission, (GBC), the managerial authority of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]]. ISKCON Guru system  was originally initiated and put in place by ISKCON's founder, [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] who organized and sometimes himself conducted [[diksa|initiations]] since early 1970s. Currently the GBC is entrusted with both spiritual and secular leadership of the ISKCON communities, as well as the power to appoint new [[guru]]s. According to a GBC confidence survey "those holding critical views of the GBC were far less committed to ISKCON" and it was also noted that householder members of ISKCON provides less support for ISKCON's gurus and the guru institution than the residents of ISKCON asramas controlled by GBC. <ref name=Rochford2007>Rochford, E. Burke (2007) ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=HiD5Enrerv0C&pg=PA245&dq=GBC+zonal&sig=0KtjM0ZtecfgorScQPKjv05wNTk Hare Krishna Transformed]'', p. 245,70. "GBC Confidence Survey"</ref>
In recent years GBC started to develop a regional seminar "''Spiritual Leadership: Being a Guru in ISKCON''" and made it mandatory for all future gurus to attend.

Since founder<U+2019>s death the number of [[ISKCON]] devotees accepting disciples has increased. Recently, some of grand-disciples (disciples of disciples) have begun to accept disciples in the next generation. 
[[Prabhupada]] is officially considered a founder-acarya, and is assumed to be "pre-eminent" guru of all devotees in his society.

According to the theological epistemology of the tradition, scriptural or Vedic knowledge is the only way to achieve the knowledge of the outworldly or transcendental realm. However the notable exception to this rule is what is called ''vaidushya-pratyaksa'', or the faultless and pure preception of a pure realised soul, which forms the foundation the scripture itself.<ref>Sarva-samvadini commentary to Tattva sandarbhuas, 12, by Jiva Goswami cited in M<U+00E5>ns Broo: As Good as God. The Guru in Gaudiya Vaisnavism. ISBN 8385527567 p. 9.</ref>

There are a few rear female gurus in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, however to this day there are no approved women gurus in [[ISKCON]].

== History ==
[[File:Satsvaupa das goswami sdg2.jpg|thumb|280px| [[Satsvarupa das Goswami]] During [[ISKCON]] [[diksa]] ceremony in [[1979]].]]
The history of initiations in [[ISKCON]] started with the foundation of the society in 1966 and developed through a number of periods from the initial date to present times. Also a number of deviations were observed.

=== Direct initiations ===

From the period of first initiation in 1966 until the early 1970 Srila Prabhupada would himself organize all initiations. At this stage movement was rather small in numbers and most of the devotees were located in United States.

=== Early deviations ===

At a festival at [[New Vrindaban]], West Virginia, on [[Janmastami]] day 1970, the senior man, [[Kirtananda Swami]], along with other three leaders, Sudama, Brahmananda and Visnujana, had announced that by leaving America, Prabhupada had rejected his disciples for failing to recognize that ''Prabhupada was actually Krishna Himself''. This is considered to be a sign of [[mayavada]]-impersonalism. Some note that "Kirtananda had previously failed to distinguish between the personal and  impersonal" understandings of God, and at this point he was among the four who had failed to distinguish the [[guru]] from the God.<ref name="tkg"/> All four were banned from preaching within ISKCON.

=== Proxy initiations ===

Starting from 1971 Prabhupada would start delegating the function of chanting of beads and doing [[yajna]] to his disciples. He would often initiate by mail and every temple president had a cassette of Prabhupada chanting the ''gayatri mantra'' which was played in the ear of the new second initiate and that was as good as hearing the [[gayatri]] [[mantra]] from <U+015A>r<U+012B>la Prabhup<U+0101>da himself. From the beginning of January 1973 Revatinandana and Kirtanananda were instructed also to chant on the beads of new initiates while Prabhupada would continue to deal with the "matter of ''brahmana'' initiations".<ref name=hs>"Kirtanananda will chant on the beads for new devotees in America, Canada, like that, you can chant on the beads for the European continent new disciples." Letter 73-01-04 cited in: Dasa,Hari Sauri [http://www.dandavats.com/?p=4131 A brief overview of the history of the process of initiation in ISKCON.]</ref><ref> Addressing a concern that one of the disciples, Siddhaswarupa started initiating his own disciples a letter to Tusta Krsna Swami, his associate, was send on December 2, 1975:

<U+201C>Keep trained very rigidly, and then you are bona fide guru, and you can accept disciples on the same principle. But as a matter of etiquette it is the custom that during the lifetime of your spiritual master you bring the prospective disciples to him, and in his absence or disappearance you can accept disciples without any limitation. This is the law of disciplic succession. I want to see my disciples become bona fide spiritual master and spread Krishna consciousness very widely; that will make me and K<U+1E5B><U+1E63><U+1E47>a very happy.<U+201D>

</ref>

=== Ritvik initiations in 1977 ===

In 1977 that was also changed by Prabhupada, and even the function of the second initiation was delegated to a few selected disciples. In the middle of May 1977,  while in Hrishikesh, his health a turned for the worse and Prabhupada called all his GBC members to Vrindavana for instruction.<ref>When they arrived Prabhup<U+0101>da told them, <U+201C>Now, if you have any questions about anything that is not clear, you meet together, you formulate your questions, and then you come to me and I will answer them.<U+201D></ref> The discussion of May 28 was recorded. There was a backlog of candidates and on 9 July the letter by his secretary,[[Tamal Krishna Goswami]], was sent out, and that named eleven senior disciples, who Prabhupada said would now be responsible for giving initiations to the new candidates. At this point the new candidates need no longer write to him and the recommendations don<U+2019>t have to come to him for confirmation.<ref name=hs/>

=== After death ===

==== Period of no initiations ====

The period from the date of death till the March 1978 annual meeting seen no initiations in ISKCON.

==== Early Zonal acaryas period ====

From 1978 till 1982 only eleven devotees were allowed to initiate new disciples and give brahmana initiation to existing ISKCON devotees.

==== Mid Zonal acaryas period ====

In 1982 a few new gurus were added to the list, including [[Gopala Krishna Goswami]]. All gurus at this stage were assigned honorific names, such as Srila Gurudeva, Srila Vishnupada, Srila Gurupada, Srila Acharyadeva, Srila Bhagavatpada, Srila Bhaktipada etc., they also accepted daily worship on a Vyasasana, the throne was allocated to each person, but a collective Vyasasanas were specially constructed for gatherings. When one of the gurus defected to [[Gaudiya Math]] in 1982, GBC had developed a sub-committee that was sent to his zone to prevent crisis. Later a separate committee was formed to appoint a new ISKCON guru for his zone.
