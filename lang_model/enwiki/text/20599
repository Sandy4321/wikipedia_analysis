'''Chiwere''' (also called '''Iowa-Otoe-Missouria''' or '''B<U+00E1>xoje-J<U+00ED>were-<U+00D1><U+00FA>t<U+2019>achi''') is a [[Siouan languages|Siouan language]] originally spoken by the [[Missouri tribe|Missouria]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], and [[Iowa tribe|Iowa]] peoples, who originated in the [[Great Lakes]] region but later moved throughout the Midwest and plains. The language is closely related to [[Winnebago language|Ho-Chunk]], also known as Winnebago. Christian missionaries first documented Chiwere in the 1830s, but since then virtually nothing has been published about the language. Chiwere suffered a steady decline after extended European-American contact in the 1850s, and by 1940 the language had almost totally ceased to be spoken.

== Language revitalization ==
The last two fluent speakers died in the winter of 1996, and only a handful of semi-fluent speakers remain, all of whom are elderly,<ref name="iolang" /> making Chiwere highly [[Endangered language|endangered]]. As of 2006, an estimated four members of the [[Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians]] still speak the language, while 30 members of the [[Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma]] speak their language.<ref name="status" /> The Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma has sponsored language workshops in the past and hopes to host more in the future. They have provided tribal elders with recording devices to collect Chiwere words and songs.<ref>[http://www.iowanation.org/Government/OralHistory.html Oral History and Language.] ''Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma''.

==Name==
The Iowa tribe refers to their language as '''B<U+00E1>xoje ich<U+2019><U+00E9>''' or '''Bah Kho Je''' (pronounced {{IPA-sio|b<U+0325>a<U+A71C>xod<U+0292><U+025B> it<U+0283><U+02BC>e<U+A71C>|}}). The Otoe-Missouria dialect is called '''J<U+00ED>were ich<U+2019><U+00E9>''' (pronounced {{IPA-sio|d<U+0325><U+0292>i<U+A71C>we<U+027E><U+025B> it<U+0283><U+02BC>e<U+A71C>|}}). The spelling ''Chiwere'', used mostly by linguists, derives from the fact that the language has an [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] distinction rather than a [[Voice (phonetics)|voice]] distinction (see the phonology section below), so that the unaspirated stops {{IPA|/b<U+0325> d<U+0325> d<U+0325><U+0292> <U+0261><U+030A>/}} are variably voiced {{IPA|[b d d<U+0292> <U+0261>]}} or unvoiced {{IPA|[p t t<U+0283> k]}}. Although {{IPA|[t<U+0283>]}} is a valid pronunciation of the first sound of ''Jiwere ~ Chiwere'', it may mislead English speakers into pronouncing it {{IPA|[t<U+0283><U+02B0>]}}. 

Similarly, a common [[folk etymology]] of ''B<U+00E1>xoje'' is "dusty noses," based on the misunderstanding of the first syllable ''b<U+00E1>'' as ''p<U+00E1>'', or "nose."<ref name="jg">GoodTracks, Jimm (1992) ''Baxoje-Jiwere-Nyut'aji - Ma'unke: Iowa-Otoe-Missouria Language to English.''

[http://iowayotoelang.nativeweb.org/ Ioway Otoe-Missouria Language Website]</ref> However, the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma says ''Bah-Kho-Je'' means "grey snow," due to their winter lodges being covered with snow stained grey by fire smoke.<ref>[http://www.iowanation.org/Government/History.html History of the Ioway.] ''Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma.'' (retrieved 22 Feb 2009)</ref>

==Phonology==
The phonology of Chiwere consists of approximately 29 consonants, three nasal vowels, and five oral vowels.

The phoneme {{IPA|/<U+027E>/}} has a number of variants and allophones. It can appear as a dental [[Tap consonant|tap]] or [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[<U+027E>]}} (especially word-medially), as an (inter)dental fricative {{IPA|[<U+00F0>]}}, as a [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] {{IPA|[l]}}, as a nasal {{IPA|[n]}}, or as a voiced dental plosive {{IPA|[d]}}.<ref name="HNAI" /><ref>GoodTracks, Jimm G. "[http://iowayotoelang.nativeweb.org/pdf/orthographic_updates.pdf Orthographic Updates]" ([[PDF]]). ''Ioway Otoe Language Study''. Retrieved October 17, 2011.</ref> The velar nasal phoneme {{IPA|/<U+014B>/}} does not occur word-initially, being confined to "medial position after a nasal vowel."<ref name="w235">Whitman, 1947, p. 235</ref>

====Phoneme combinations====
In languages there are certain clusters of phonemes that show up in particular environments within a word. According to William Whitman's research of Chiwere, there are approximately 23 known consonant clusters which are word medial and approximately 14 of these show up word initially or word medially. In this research it has been found that the stop + stop consonant cluster ''<U+010D>d'', as in ''<U+00E1><U+010D>da'' ('then'),<ref name="w236">Whitman, 1947, p. 236</ref> shows up in the word medial position but not as a word initial phoneme cluster.

The stop + spirant clusters ''<U+0294><U+03B8>'', ''<U+0294>s'', and ''<U+0294>h'' all show up word initially and word medially, whereas the stop + semivowel clusters ''dw'' and ''gw'' only show up word medially.<ref name="w236" /> The stop + liquid clusters ''bl'' and ''gl'' show up word initially and word medially.<ref name="w236" /> Spirant + stop clusters generally appear in both word initial and word medial position, these clusters include ''<U+03B8>g'', ''s<U+01F0>'', ''sg'', ''hd'', and ''hg'', however the spirant + stop clusters ''sd'' and ''xd'' only appear word medially.<ref name="w236" /> These are all the spirant + stop clusters accounted for in the research of William Whitman, however, the spirant + stop cluster ''hk'' has been found to exist word medially, as in ''ch<U+00E9>thka'' ('domestic cow').<ref>GoodTracks, Rev. 2007, p.2</ref>

According to Whitman's research there are two spirant + nasal consonant clusters that have been found, which are ''hm'', as in ''s<U+00E1>hm<U+00E3>'' ('seven') and ''hn'', as in ''l<U+00E1>hn<U+0169>we'' ('calumet'), however Whitman does account that ''h<U+00F1>'' is a combination which appears as a future tense suffix.<ref name="w236" /> After reviewing further data, the cluster ''h<U+00F1>'' has been found in the word medial position position, as in ''p<U+00E9>h<U+00F1>i'' ('whiskey')<ref>GoodTracks, Rev. 2010, p.13</ref> and thus appears to be another possible spirant + nasal consonant combination.

The stop + semivowel consonant clusters ''<U+03B8>w'', ''xw'', and ''hw'' all appear to be restricted to the word medial environment, whereas the stop + semivowel consonant cluster ''sw'' appears to be the only stop + semivowel known to show up both word initially, as in ''sw<U+00E1><U+0303>la'' ('to be soft') and ''basw<U+00E1>'' ('to cut piece off').<ref name="w236"/> The stop + liquid phoneme clusters ''<U+03B8>l'', ''sl'', and ''xl'' have all been found in the word initial and word medial environments.<ref name="w236"/>

=====Cluster metamorphosis and phenomenon=====
An interesting analysis of the Chiwere language has shown that the spirant + stop consonant cluster ''hg'' as being the more commonly used pronunciation of the spirant + stop cluster ''<U+03B8>g'' and that the ''hg'' cluster may be replacing the ''<U+03B8>g'' all together.<ref name="w236"/>

In William Whitman's research, the spirant + stop combination ''xd'', with the one given example used in this journal being ''ibl<U+00ED><U+0303>xdo'' ('blackbird'), is mentioned as being an error for the spirant + stop combination ''hd''.<ref name="w236"/> But the spirant + stop combination ''xd'' has also been found in the words ''ch<U+00E9>xd<U+00F3>'' ('buffalo bull'),<ref>GoodTracks, Rev. 2010, p.2</ref> ''n<U+00E1>xda'' ('sour'), and ''n<U+00E1>xdage'' ('kick').<ref>GoodTracks, Rev. 2007, p.10</ref> With this data we can see that the consonant cluster ''xd'' is a possible combination and can show up in word medial position.

===Vowels===
Chiwere has five [[oral vowel]] phonemes, {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}, and three [[nasal vowel]] phonemes, {{IPA|/<U+00E3> <U+0129> <U+0169>/}}. [[Vowel length]] is distinctive as well.<ref name="HNAI"/>
