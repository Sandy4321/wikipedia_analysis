The '''Royal Danish Navy''' ('''RDN''') (officially '''''Kongelige Danske Marine''''' in [[Danish language|Danish]] but generally known as '''''S<U+00F8>v<U+00E6>rnet''''' or 'Sea Defence') is the [[Naval warfare|sea-based branch]] of the [[Danish Defence]] force. The RDN is mainly responsible for  maritime defence and maintaining the [[sovereignty]] of [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Greenland]]ic and [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[territorial waters]]. Other tasks include [[surveillance]], [[search and rescue]], [[Icebreaker|icebreaking]], [[oil spill|oil spill recovery and prevention]] as well as contributions to international tasks and forces.

During the period 1509-1814 when [[Denmark]] was in union with [[Norway]], the Danish Navy was part of the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy]]. Despite the country's relatively small size, the navy is now  equipped with a number of large state-of-the-art vessels commissioned since the end of the [[Cold War]]. This can be explained by its strategic location as the NATO member controlling access to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].

Danish Navy ships carry the prefix '''KDM''' (''Kongelige Danske Marine'') in Danish, but this is translated to '''HDMS''' (''Her / His Danish Majesty's Ship'') in English. Denmark is one of several [[Members of NATO|NATO member states]] whose navies do not deploy submarines.

== History of the Danish navy ==
The geographic layout of Denmark (not including Greenland and the Faroe Islands) has a [[coastline]] to land area ratio of 1:5.9. By comparison, the figure for the [[Netherlands]] is 1:92.1 and for the [[USA]], 1:493.2<ref name=CIAFB>{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |title = CIA: The World Factbook |accessdate = 2008-07-20 }}</ref> Denmark therefore naturally has long-standing maritime traditions, dating back to the 9th century when the [[Viking]]s had small but well-organised fleets. They were often based in a small number of villages, usually with a common defence agreement, similar to NATO's pact today. As the [[Viking ship]]s, usually of the ''[[Knarr]]'' type, were light, and therefore easy to transport from village to village over land. With time, the defence pacts gave rise to larger, more offensive fleets which the Vikings used for [[plunder]]ing coastal areas. In the period after the Vikings and up to the 15th century, the fleet consisted mainly of merchant vessels. Indeed, it is said that [[Valdemar II of Denmark|king Valdemar Sejr]] had more than 1,000 ships during the conquest of [[Estonia]] in 1219. Together they carried more than 30,000 soldiers with horses and supplies.

Records exist of a unified Danish navy from the late 14th century. [[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margaret I]], who had just founded the [[Kalmar Union]] (consisting of [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], parts of [[Finland]] and parts of [[Germany]]) ordered the building of a navy <U+2014> mainly to defend the union against the [[Hanseatic League]]. Earlier the national fleet had consisted of vessels owned and operated by the [[nobility]], but the country as such did not have a navy. The earlier [[Monarchy|monarchs]] therefore had to rely on [[conscription]] from the nobility, which was not always easy as the monarchy itself often had enemies within the nobility. Queen Margaret I gave instructions for a navy to be constituted and maintained under the control of the monarchy. The nobility still had to provide crews (which consisted mainly of "volunteered" farmers) for these ships, though the core crew-members (i.e. [[Captain (nautical)#Master|master]]s, [[master-at-arms]] and [[carpenter|master carpenters]]) could be employed by the monarch. There were also education [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], mainly levied from the nobility.

In the 15th century, especially during the reign of [[Hans of Denmark|King Hans]], Danish trade expanded appreciably, increasing the need for the delivery of merchandise. As shipping was the ideal means of transport at the time, Danish maritime interests had to be further protected. King Hans is credited with establishing the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Common Fleet]] in 1509, substantially increasing the number of professional crewmembers. They were mainly petty criminals, who had to choose between working in the king<U+2019>s navy or imprisonment. They received basic training in seamanship and carpentry enabling them to sail the ships. Responsibility for weaponry and combat was still in the hands of conscripted farmers. For these, the country was divided into a number of counties <U+2014> known in Danish as ''skip<U+00E6>n'' (the term ''skip'' being related to the Danish word for ship, ''skib''), which would later serve as the Danish [[diocese]]s. It was also during this period that dedicated naval bases and shipyards were founded. They would build, maintain and fit out the king<U+2019>s navy. The first record of a dedicated naval base is ''Bremerholmd'' (later ''[[Gammelholm]]'') in the year 1500.

The founding of the Danish navy is often viewed in Denmark as taking place on 10 August 1510 when King Hans appointed his vassal [[Henrich Krummedige|Henrik Krummedige]] to become "chief captain and head of all our captains, men and servants whom we now have appointed and ordered to be at sea." <ref>Mikael Bill, Pernille Kroer, Niels Mejdal, Leif Mortensen, "Danmarks Fl<U+00E5>de i 500 <U+00E5>r", specialavis udgivet af Sov<U+00E6>rnets Operative Kommando i samarbejde med Danmarks Marineforening, 4 June 2010. {{Da icon}}</ref><ref>[http://flaaden500.dk/Historien.4.aspx "Den danske fl<U+00E5>de 1510-2010"] {{Da icon}} Retrieved 5 June 2010.</ref>  

[[File:Battle in k<U+00F8>ge bay-claus moinichen 1686.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of K<U+00F8>ge Bay]]]]
When [[Frederick II of Denmark|King Frederick II]] was crowned in 1559, he immediately began expanding the navy further. The number of bases, yards and vessels rose rapidly and substantial resources were used for new ship designs, weaponry, training and battle tactics. [[Sweden]], which had become an independent country, dominated a large part of the [[Baltic Sea]], threatening Danish merchant interests. In retaliation, Denmark closed the [[<U+00D8>resund]] in 1568, laying the first seeds for the [[Scanian War]] (1675-1679), only eight years after the end of the [[Northern Wars|second Nordic War]] (1657-1660), during which Denmark lost the now Swedish provinces of ''Sk<U+00E5>ne'', ''Halland'' and ''Blekinge''. During this period further resources were allocated to the navy. [[Cort Adler]] and [[Niels Juel]] led the Danish navy to a victory in the [[Battle of K<U+00F8>ge Bay]] in 1667.

[[Christian IV of Denmark|King Christian IV]] (crowned in 1588) continued in his father's footsteps. In the beginning of the 17th century, he considerably expanded the naval workships. In [[Copenhagen]], where the navy resided, he built a large number of homes for crewmembers and workshop craftsmen <U+2014> the most famous being [[Nyboder]] (completed in 1631) which still stands in central Copenhagen. 

General admiral lieutenant [[Ulrik Christian Gyldenl<U+00F8>ve, Count of Sams<U+00F8>|Ulrik Christian Gyldenl<U+00F8>ve]] was appointed supreme commander of the navy in 1701. He raised the status of the naval profession and established ''S<U+00F8>kadetakademie'', the predecessor of the [[Royal Danish Naval Academy]]. In 1709, Peter Jansen Wessel joined the navy. He was later given the rank of admiral as a reward for his many victories - most famously at ''Marstrand'' and ''Dynekilden''. He was later known as ''[[Tordenskjold]]''.

[[File:Dronning Juliane Marie.gif|thumb|''Dronning Juliane Marie''<br />approx. 1750]]
In 1712, Tordenskjold succeeded in burning 80 Swedish naval cruisers. This played a large part in the outcome of the [[Great Northern War|Great Nordic War]] (1709-1720). Since [[Scandinavia]] now was at peace, the navy focused its resources on other parts of the world, resulting in colonisation of [[Africa]] and the [[Caribbean]]. A permanent naval force was also sent to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to protect Danish interests (mainly merchant vessels and colonies). A pact of neutrality was made between Denmark (including Norway) and Sweden, providing a solid basis for commercial expansion.

The [[Great Britain|British]], under pressure from the [[France|French]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], became increasingly reluctant to allow Denmark to trade overseas as they believed [[Napoleon]] could benefit economically from Danish commerce. In 1801, they decided to attack a Danish line of defence, in the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]], under the command of [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Admiral Hyde Parker]]. The defence line, under the command of [[Olfert Fischer]], was far smaller than the attacking force and was easily subdued. Denmark was therefore forced to make an agreement with the British. In the following six years, Denmark managed to stay clear of the Napoleonic Wars, until the events leading to the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|second Battle of Copenhagen]] in 1807. Britain was afraid the Danish fleet might fall under the control of Napoleon, perhaps tipping the balance in his favour. [[Christian VII of Denmark|King Christian VII]] refused to hand over his navy to the British for safekeeping until the end of the war, and the British attacked. After the battle, the ''Bombardment of Copenhagen'' (from 2 to 5 September) took place under Admiral Gambier. It is generally accepted as the first terror bombardment by a fleet,<ref>{{cite book|title=Defying Napoleon: How Britain Bombarded Copenhagen and Seized the Danish Fleet in 1807|publisher=The History Press Ltd|edition=07 edition (13 Mar 2007)|isbn=978-0750942799}}</ref> in which the terrorising of civilians was used to gain a political goal.

In 1814, Denmark and Norway were separated relatively peacefully, after more than 300 years together. At the same time the Common Fleet was split into the Royal Danish Navy and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]].

[[File:Undervandsb<U+00E5>den Havmanden 1914.jpg|thumb|200px|The Danish submarine "Havmanden" circa World War One]]
The navy was slowly rebuilt, but it was nowhere near its former size. Faith was nevertheless placed in the navy, interests in Africa and the Caribbean still receiving considerable attention. In 1845, a two-year research expedition was launched on the corvette ''Galathea''. In the [[Second Schleswig War]] (1864), the navy was still relatively small and old-fashioned. Only a few steam vessels were at hand and these had a large impact on the war. As a result, it was considered necessary for the navy to be modernised. By the outbreak of [[World War I]] (1914), the Danish navy was a very modern fleet, mainly equipped with armoured steam ships and only a very few sailing ships.

In the period between the two world wars, the Danish navy (as well as the rest of the Danish military forces) had low priority for the politicians, especially between 1929 and 1942 under [[Thorvald Stauning]]. During the first year of the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation]] (1940-1945), the navy, assisted the occupying German forces with minesweeping, because of the political demand of keeping the infrastructure (ferry-lines) up and running. The tensions between the German soldiers and the Danish armed forces rose slowly and on 29 August 1943, they managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships, while Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels. This was due to a secret order, given directly to the captains by word of mouth by commander of the navy, Vice Admiral [[A. H. Vedel]] "to try to flee to the nearest neutral or nazi-opposed port. If that was not possible the ship should be scuttled at as deep a location as possible". The Germans later succeeded in raising and refitting 15 of the sunken ships. During the scuttling of the Danish fleet, a number of vessels were ordered to attempt an escape to Swedish waters, 13 succeeding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/English/Timeline/Timeline_08.htm |title=Danish Naval Historical Time Line: August |accessdate=2008-07-28 }}</ref><ref name=29AUG>{{cite web |url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/English/History/1939_1945/August29.htm |title=Danish Navy left without any military options |accessdate=2008-07-28 }}</ref> The score for the larger vessels was therefore: 32 vessels were sunk, 2 were in Greenland, 4 reached Sweden, 14 were captured by the Germans. As for the smaller vessels: 9 "patruljekuttere" reached Sweden, 50 others were captured by the Germans<ref name=29AUG/>. By the autumn of 1944, these ships officially formed a Danish naval [[flotilla]] in exile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/Danish/Historien/1939_1945/DenDanskeFlotille.htm |title=Den danske Flotille 1944-1945 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |language=Danish}}</ref> In September 1943, A. H. Vedel was fired by order of the prime minister [[Vilhelm Buhl]], because of his hostile actions towards the Germans. In November 1943, the Swedish authorities allowed 500 Danish soldiers in Sweden to train as "police troops". By the autumn of 1944, Sweden raised this number to 4,800 and recognised the entire unit as a Danish military [[brigade]] in exile.

In the post-war years, Denmark joined NATO in 1949. As a result, Denmark received large amounts of material and financing through the [[Marshall Plan]]. Furthermore several ships was purchased from the British and a number of vessels were transferred from the now disarmed [[German Navy|German navy]].

During [[Cold War|the Cold War]], the Danish navy was rebuilt and modernised, the main assignment being to repel an invasion from [[Warsaw Pact|the Warsaw Pact]]. Typical operations requiring training were [[Naval mine|minelaying]] (the now disbanded minelayers of the ''Falster-class'' (17 [[Knot (speed)|kn]], 2,000 [[Tonnage#Tonnage measurements|GRT]]), was the worlds largest minelayers at their time - each had a complement of 280 900&nbsp;kg mines) and sting attacks with small but fast combat craft (such as the ''S<U+00F8>l<U+00F8>ven-class'' [[torpedo boat]]s (54 [[Knot (speed)|kn]], 158 [[Tonnage#Tonnage measurements|GRT]]) and ''Willemoes-class'' [[missile boat|missile torpedo boats]] (45 [[Knot (speed)|kn]], 260 [[Tonnage#Tonnage measurements|GRT]]) and a self-sustaining mobile missile battery (MOBA) equipped with targeting and guidance, capable of firing [[Boeing AGM-84 Harpoon|Harpoon missiles]]<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mwx50XYXwE Video on YouTube showing Danish mobile missile battery firing]</ref>. The Danish intelligence capabilities were also expanded and the Danish [[submarine]]s trained for ''very shallow water operations'', while a special naval force - the [[Danish Frogman Corps]] was created. The naval bases in [[Frederikshavn]] and [[Kors<U+00F8>r]] plus the fortresses at [[Langeland]] and [[Stevns]] were created through NATO funds in the 1950s.

Since the end of the Cold War, the navy has been in a transitional phase, from local defence to global operations, with fewer but larger vessels able to operate for long periods at sea. It has also been more self-sustaining. Under the defence agreement (1995-1999) which initiated the process, several of the old "cold war" frigates and minesweepers were decommissioned. The squadron structure prior to this defence agreement was as follows:

* 1st Squadron = The North Atlantic Squadron (Danish: 'InspektionsSkibsEskadren' (ISE)) with 5 ocean patrol vessels (1 ''Beskytteren''-class, 4 ''Thetis''-class), 3 ocean patrol cutters (''Agdlek''-class) and 4 icebreakers
* 2nd Squadron = The Frigate Squadron (Danish: 'FreGatEskadren' (FGE)) with 2 frigates (''Peder Skram''-class), 3 corvettes (''Niels Juel''-class), 14 StanFlex-vessels (''Flyvefisken''-class) and 6 seaward defence craft (''Daphne''-class, decommissioned in 1991)
* 3rd Squadron = The Mine Squadron (Danish: 'MineSkibsEskadren' (MSE)) with 4 minelayers (''Falster''-class), 2 cable-minelayers (''Lindormen''-class) and 7 minesweepers (''Sund''-class, decommissioned in 1999)
* 4th Squadron = The Torpedo Boat Squadron (Danish: 'TorpedoB<U+00E5>dsEskadren' (TBE)) with 13 torpedo-/missile boats (8 ''Willemoes''-class, 5 ''S<U+00F8>l<U+00F8>ven''-class), 2 oilers (''Faxe''-class) and a truck-detachment with missiles and radars called ''MOBA''
* 5th Squadron = The Submarine Squadron (Danish: 'UndervandsB<U+00E5>dsEskadren' (UBE)) with 6 submarines (3 ''[[Kobben class|Tumleren''-class]], 3 ''Springeren''-class) and the Frogmans Corps

In the defence agreement of 2000-2004, further restructuring of the navy was ordered, as well as the decommissioning of several units. Furthermore the only unit of ''Beskytteren''-class was donated to [[Estonian Navy|the Estonian Navy]] as [[EML Admiral Pitka (A230)|''Admiral Pitka'' (A230)]]. With the decommissioning of the torpedo boats, the 4th squadron was disbanded and the remnants were transferred to the 2nd squadron. Other units were also decommissioned. The squadron structure now looked like this:
* 1st Squadron with 4 ocean patrol vessels (''Thetis''-class), 3 ocean patrol cutters (''Agdlek''-class) and 3 icebreakers
* 2nd Squadron with 3 corvettes (''Niels Juel''-class), 14 StanFlex-vessels (''Flyvefisken''-class), 2 oilers (''Faxe''-class) and a truck-detachment with missiles and radars called ''MOBA'' and a new truck-unit ''MLOG'' with shops, spare parts, mechanics, etc.
* 3rd Squadron = The Mine Squadron (Danish: 'MineSkibsEskadren' (MSE)) with 4 minelayers (''Falster''-class) and 2 cable-minelayers (''Lindormen''-class)
* 5th Squadron = The Submarine Squadron (Danish: 'UndervandsB<U+00E5>dsEskadren' (UBE)) with 4 submarines (3 ''[[Kobben class|Tumleren''-class]], 1 ''Kronbrog''-class - leased Swedish ''[[N<U+00E4>cken class submarine|N<U+00E4>cken''-class]]) and the Frogman Corps

On 1 January 2006, a major reorganisation was carried out as a part of the defence agreement of 2005-2009 (which also put an end to the 95 year old submarine service), when the former four squadrons were divided into two squadrons:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forsvaret.dk/STS/Skibe+og+materiel/ |title=Materiel i S<U+00F8>v<U+00E6>rnet |accessdate=2008-07-28 |language=Danish}}</ref>

* 1st Squadron - domestic affairs squadron
* 2nd Squadron - foreign affairs squadron

===Admiral Danish Fleet===
{{main|Admiral Danish Fleet}}
The [[Admiral Danish Fleet]] (in Danish ''S<U+00F8>v<U+00E6>rnets Operative Kommando''), led by a Rear Admiral, is directly responsible to the [[Defence Command (Denmark)|Danish Defence Command]].

===The squadrons===
The Danish fleet today is divided into two squadrons:
* [[Danish navy 1st Squadron|1st Squadron]], administratively based at ''Naval Base [[Frederikshavn]]'', handles all tasks regarding domestic affairs, such as maritime defence and [[sovereignty]] of [[Denmark|Danish]], [[Greenland]]ic and [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] [[territorial waters]], [[surveillance]], [[search and rescue]], [[Icebreaker|icebreaking]] and [[oil spill|oil spill recovery and prevention]]. It has provided units for international tasks, such as the environmental recovery vessel ''Gunnar Seidenfaden'' for the cleanup after [[Prestige oil spill|the Prestige oil spill]] and the ocean patrol vessel ''[[HDMS Thetis (F357)|Thetis]]'' for the protection force programme of [[World Food Programme|WFP]] chartered ships at [[Horn of Africa|the Horn of Africa]]. [[Vessels in the Danish Navy#1st_Squadron|Vessels operated by 1st Squadron]].
* [[Danish navy 2nd Squadron|2nd Squadron]], administratively based at ''Naval Base [[Kors<U+00F8>r]]'', is specialized in foreign affairs. It conducts exercises for participation in various international tasks, such as providing protection force, [[Emergency management|disaster relief operations]] and [[non-combatant evacuation operation]]s. It permanently provides units for international standing maritime groups as well as supporting various maritime operations. [[Vessels in the Danish Navy#2nd_Squadron|Vessels operated by 2nd Squadron]].

===Naval Operational Logistic Support===

The Naval Operational Logistic Support Structure (OPLOG), including the naval bases in [[Frederikshavn]] and [[Kors<U+00F8>r]] as well as several naval stations.

====Naval bases====
The naval bases' task is to provide logistic support for the ships and vessels, through the OPLOGs. This includes configuration, maintaining and repairing the units. Furthermore similar support is provided to civilian agencies (i.e. the [[Police of Denmark|Danish police]]) and allied units.

The support is mainly provided within the geographical areas of the naval bases. For Naval Base Kors<U+00F8>r that is [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], [[Funen]], [[Bornholm]] as well as the surrounding waters. For Naval Base Frederikshavn it is [[Jutland]], [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Furthermore general support is provided for units participating in international operations in peacetime, as well as all units in crisis and wartime. 

====Naval stations====
The navy maintains a number of naval stations. These are smaller stations with limited support functions. The best known is the publicly accessible [[Holmen naval base|Naval Station Holmen]] in [[Copenhagen]]. There are also naval stations located in [[Esbjerg]], [[Kongs<U+00F8>re]], on [[M<U+00F8>n]], in [[<U+00C5>rhus]] and [[Lyngsb<U+00E6>k]].

===Naval Air Squadron===
{{main|Danish Naval Air Squadron}}
The Danish Naval Air Squadron operates and maintains the navy's 8 [[Westland Lynx]] helicopters.

===Special forces units===

[[File:HDMS Vaedderen (F359).jpg|thumb|''V<U+00E6>dderen'' (F359)<br />[[Thetis class ocean patrol vessel|''Thetis''-class]]]]
The Danish navy currently operates 12 larger vessels ([[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] > 1,500 [[Tonne|t(m)]]), 4 medium-size vessels (1,500 t(m) > displacement > 500 t(m)) and 38 small vessels (500 t(m) > displacement > 15 t(m)) as well as a number of [[rigid-hulled inflatable boat]]s, boats etc.

The navy ship programs are generally of the "''newer but fewer''" type. Many of the vessels are of more recent dates (''Absalon''-class from 2004-2005, ''Thetis''-class from 1991-1994 and ''Flyvefisken''-class from 1986-1995) or under replacement, i.e. the corvettes of the ''Niels Juel''-class (1978-1980) are under replacement with three new [[Ivar Huitfeldt class frigate|''Ivar Huitfeldt''-class]] ''[[Frigates]]'' currently under construction for 2nd Squadron and the ''Bars<U+00F8>''-class (1969-1973) will be replaced with 6 ''Diana''-class small patrol crafts. Finally two of the three ''Agdlek''-class (1973-1979) will be replaced with the new ''Knud Rasmussen''-class vessels.

==Aerial vehicles==
[[File:142mTMG.jpg|thumb|[[Westland Lynx|Lynx-helicopter]]]]
The Royal Danish Navy operates 8 Westland SuperLynx Mk.90B (upgraded from Mk.23, Mk.80 & Mk.90) helicopters: S-134, S-142, S-170, S-175, S-181, S-191, S-249 & S-256. Helicopters S-035, S-187 and S-196 are decommissioned. S-035 (ex. ''G-BFDT'' and ''3-H-41''), S-249 (ex. ''G-BKBL'' and ''3-H-43'') and S-256 (ex. ''G-17-11'' and ''3-H-44'') were originally built as Mk.23 version for the [[Argentine Navy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukserials.com/prodlists.php?type=696| title=Demobbed Aircraft: Lynx| accessdate=2008-07-28 }}</ref> but were hit with an embargo when the [[Falklands War]] erupted and sold off to Denmark. S-035 never flew in the Danish Navy but it participated in the Falklands War as 3-H-41 (embarked on [[ARA H<U+00E9>rcules]]). It is cut in two and the cockpit is used for tactical observer's simulator and the cabin is used for [[helicopter egress]] training by Danish special forces. The original 8 serials were S-134, S-142, S-170, S-175, S-181, S-187, S-191 and S-196, purchased as Mk.80-versions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pub50.bravenet.com/forum/4287808284/show/614233 |title=s<U+00F8>v<U+00E6>rnets helikoptere s-035 og s-196 |accessdate=2008-07-28 |language=Danish}}</ref>  S-170 hit the ground at a public display in G<U+00F3>raszka, Poland 1997-06-14 but was rebuild. S-187 was lost near [[V<U+00E1>gar Airport]] (1987-02-20) and S-196 in the [[Baltic Sea]] (1985-08-14).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futura-dtp.dk/FLEET/Fly/pdf/Lynx.PDF |title=Lynx inventory |accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref>

==Ranks and insignia==

The Danish navy ranks follows the [[Ranks and insignia of NATO|NATO system of ranks and insignia]], as does the rest of the Danish armed forces.

The highest officer's rank is the OF-9 (''Admiral'') which is reserved for the ''Chief of Defence'' (only when this seat is occupied by a naval officer) and the Prince Consort of Denmark ([[<U+00E0> la suite]]). Similarly, the OF-8 (''Vice-admiral'') is reserved for the ''Defence Chief of Staff''). OF-7 (''Kontreadmiral'') is used by the [[Admiral Danish Fleet]] and OF-6 (''Flotilleadmiral'') by the chief of ''Danish Task Group'' as well as keepers of high-office positions. OF-4 and OF-5 are mainly chiefs of squadrons, schools and larger vessels. OF-1 through OF-3 are used in a variety of positions.

The [[Other ranks, Denmark|Danish OR's]] also follow the NATO system, though there are no OR-6's and OR-4's (''korporal'') are only used in international missions. 

Outside this ranking system there are [[physician]]s (who may wear the same insignia in the Army/Air Force but with a slight variation in the Navy), [[nurse]]s and [[veterinarian]]s, while [[priest]]s and [[judicial|judicial personnel]] wear totally different insignia and are without rank.

Besides the NATO-system, the Danish defence utilizes its own system, which for the navy is as follows:

* Military personnel, level 400 (M400): Executive level: OF-5 though OF-9
* Military personnel, level 300 (M300): Operational level: OF-1 through OF-4
* Military personnel, level 200 (M200): NCO level: OR-4 through OR-9
* Military personnel, level 100 (M100): Seamen level: OR-1 through OR-3
