The '''Blackbird''', '''Common Blackbird''' or '''Eurasian Blackbird''' (''Turdus merula'') is a species of true [[thrush (bird)|thrush]] which breeds in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[North Africa]], and has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. It has a number of [[subspecies]] across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered as full species.  Depending on [[latitude]], the Blackbird may be [[Resident bird|resident]], partially [[Bird migration|migratory]] or fully migratory.<ref name="HBW3"/>

The male of the [[Subspecies#Nomenclature|nominate subspecies]], which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and [[Beak|bill]] and has a wide range of vocalisations; the adult female and [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] have mainly brown [[plumage]]. This species  breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is [[omnivorous]], eating a wide range of [[insect]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[seed]]s, [[Berry|berries]], and [[fruit]]s. 

Both sexes are territorial on the breeding grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs will stay in their territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently [[temperate]]. This common species has given rise to a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its melodious song.

==Taxonomy==
The Blackbird was described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' in 1758 under the genus ''[[Turdus]]''.<ref>{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

(Laurentii Salvii). | date=1758| pages=p. 824}}</ref> The binomial name derives from two [[Latin]] words, ''Turdus'', "thrush", and  ''merula'', "blackbird", the latter giving rise to the [[French language|French]] name for this species, ''merle''.<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite book |title= Le Grand Robert de la langue fran<U+00E7>aise |last= Le Robert |first= Paul |coauthors= |publisher= Dictionnaires Le Robert  |year=2001 |id=ISBN 2850366730}}</ref> There are about 65 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus ''Turdus'', characterised by rounded heads, longish pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. The Blackbird seems to be closest in evolutionary terms to the [[Island Thrush]] (''T.&nbsp;poliocephalus'') of the southwest [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], which probably diverged from ''merula'' stock fairly recently.<ref name=Clement/>

It is not immediately clear in [[modern English]] why the name "Blackbird", first recorded in 1486, was applied to this species, but not to another common black European bird, such as the [[Carrion Crow]], [[Common Raven|Raven]], [[Rook (bird)|Rook]] or [[Jackdaw]].  However, in [[Old English Language|Old English]], and in modern English up to about the [[18th Century]], "bird" was used only for smaller or young birds, and larger ones, such as crows were called "fowl". The Blackbird was therefore the only widespread and conspicuous "black bird" in the [[British Isles]].<ref name="OED">''Oxford English Dictionary'' 1933: Bird (sense 2), Blackbird</ref> Until about the [[17th century]], another usual name for the species was ''ouzel'', ''ousel'' or ''wosel'' (from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''osle''). Another variant occurs in Act 3 of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', where [[Nick Bottom|Bottom]] refers to ''The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill.'' The ousel usage survived later in [[poetry]], and still occurs as the name of the closely related Ring Ouzel, and in ''Water Ouzel'', an alternative name for the unrelated but superficially similar [[White-throated Dipper]] (''Cinclus cinclus'').<ref name= birdnames>{{cite book | last = Lockwood| first =W.

Around 20 species of the New World [[icterid]] family are named as blackbirds because of their superficial resemblance to the Old World thrushes, but they are not closely related, being nearer to the [[New World warbler]]s and [[tanager]]s in evolutionary terms.<ref name= Jaramillo/> They include the [[Red-winged Blackbird]] (''Agelaius phoeniceus''), [[Red-breasted Blackbird]] (''Sturnella militaris''), [[Yellow-headed Blackbird]] (''Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus'') and the [[Melodious Blackbird]] (''Dives dives'').<ref name= Jaramillo>{{cite book |title=New World Blackbirds: The Icterids (Helm Identification Guides)  |last= Jaramillo |first=Alvaro |coauthors=Burke, Peter |publisher=Christopher Helm Publishers Ltd|year=1997 |id= ISBN  0-7136-4333-1}}</ref>

==Description==
The Blackbird of the nominate subspecies ''T. m. merula'' is 23.5 to 29&nbsp;[[centimetre]]s (9.25 to 11.4&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) in length, has a long tail, and weighs 80<U+2013>125&nbsp;[[gram]]mes (2.8 to 4.4&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]). The adult male has glossy black [[plumage]], blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow [[Beak|bill]]. The bill darkens somewhat in winter.<ref name= Collins/> The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The [[Juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] is similar to the female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males.<ref name= Collins/> The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker eye ring, and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.<ref name= Clement/>

===Subspecies===
As would be expected for a widespread passerine bird species, several geographical subspecies are recognised. The treatment of subspecies in this article follows Clement ''et al'' (2000).<ref name = Clement/> 
[[Image:Female Blackbird.jpg|thumb|Female of subspecies ''merula'']]
*''T. m. merula'', the nominate subspecies, breeds commonly throughout much of Europe from [[Iceland]], the [[Faeroes]] and the [[British Isles]] east to the [[Ural Mountains]] and north to about 70 N, where  it is fairly scarce. A small population breeds in the [[Nile]] valley. Birds from the north of the range winter throughout Europe and around the [[Mediterranean]] including [[Cyprus]] and North Africa. The introduced birds in Australia and New Zealand are of the nominate race.<ref name = Clement/>
*''T. m. azorensis'' is a small race which breeds in the [[Azores]]. The male is darker and glossier than ''merula''.<ref name=BWP/>
*''T. m. cabrerae'', named for [[<U+00C1>ngel Cabrera]], [[Spain|Spanish]] [[zoology|zoologist]], resembles ''azorensis'' and breeds in [[Madeira]] and the western [[Canary Islands]].<ref name=BWP/>
*''T. m. mauretanicus'', another small dark species with a glossy black  male plumage, breeds in central and northern [[Morocco]], coastal [[Algeria]] and northern [[Tunisia]].<ref name=BWP/>
*''T m. aterrimus'' breeds in [[Hungary]], south and east to southern [[Greece]], [[Crete]] northern [[Turkey]] and northern [[Iran]]. It winters in  southern Turkey, northern [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]] and southern Iran. It is smaller than ''merula'' with a duller male and paler female plumage.<ref name=BWP/>
*''T. m. syriacus'' breeds on the Mediterranean coast of southern Turkey south to [[Jordan]], [[Israel]] and the northern [[Sinai]]. It is mostly resident, but part of the population moves south west or west to winter in the [[Jordan River| Jordan Valley]]  and in the [[Nile Delta]] of northern [[Egypt]] south to about [[Cairo]]. Both sexes of this subspecies are darker and greyer than the equivalent ''merula'' plumages.<ref name = Clement/>
*''T. m. intermedius'' is an Asiatic race breeding from Central [[Russia]] to [[Tajikistan]], western and north east Afghanistan, and eastern [[China]]. Many birds are resident but some are altitudinal migrants and occur in southern Afghanistan and southern Iraq in winter.<ref name= Clement/> This is a large subspecies, with a sooty-black male and a blackish-brown female.<ref name="HBW3"/>[[Image:Eurasian blackbird maximus cropped.jpg|thumb|Female of subspecies ''maximus'', at 3,400 m (11000 ft) in [[Himachal Pradesh]]]]
*''T. m. maximus'' is a large montane subspecies found from eastern Afghanistan east through the Himalayas between 3200 and 4800&nbsp;metres (10,560<U+2013>16,000&nbsp;ft) to [[Sikkim]], [[Assam]], southern Tibet and western [[Szechwan]], China. It is an altitudinal migrant, and in winter occurs down to 2100&nbsp;metres (6930&nbsp;ft) in south east Tibet, but not below 3000&nbsp;metres (9900&nbsp;ft) further west. The male is black and the female very dark brown.<ref name=India/> It is the only subspecies without a yellow or orange eye-ring.<ref name="HBW2"/>
*''T. m. mandarinus'' breeds throughout much of south, central and east China.<ref name="China">MacKinnon, J., & Phillipps, K. (2000). ''A Field Guide to the Birds of China.'' Oxford University Press. Oxford. ISBN 0198549407</ref> It is a partial migrant to [[Hong Kong]] and south to [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]]. The male is sooty black, and the female is similar but browner, and paler on the underparts.<ref name= Robson >{{cite book | last = Robson | first = Craig | coauthors= |title = A Field Guide to the Birds of Thailand | year = 2004 | publisher = New Holland Press | isbn = 1843309211}} p228</ref> It is a large subspecies.<ref name="HBW3"/>
*''T. m. sowerbyi'', named for [[James Sowerby]], [[Great Britain|British]] [[naturalist]] and illustrator, breeds from east Szechwan to [[Guizhou]]. It is partially migratory, with some individuals spending the winter in south China and north [[Indochina]]. It resembles ''mandarinus'', but is smaller and darker below.<ref name="HBW3"/>
*''T. m. nigropileus'' is resident up to about 1820&nbsp;metres (6000&nbsp;ft) in the [[Western Ghats]] of western India and the northern and central parts of the [[Western Ghats]]. The male is brownish slate-grey with a dark cap, and the female is mid-brown, paler below.<ref name=India/> It is small with a relatively broad yellow eye-ring.<ref name="HBW1"/>
*''T. m. spencei'', named for [[William Spence (entomologist)|William Spence]],  [[Great Britain|British]] [[entomology|entomologist]], is very similar to  ''nigropileus'', but has a less distinct cap. It is resident in the highlands of eastern India.<ref name = Clement/> It is of dubious validity, and is often included in ''nigropileus''.<ref name="HBW1"/>
*''T. m. simillimus'' is a common resident of the hills in [[Kerala]] and [[Tamil Nadu]], south west India. It is darker than ''spencei''.<ref name = Clement/>
*''T. m. bourdilloni'', named for [[T. F. Bourdillon|Thomas Fulton Bourdillon]], Conservator of Forests in the then princely state of [[Travancore]], is a common resident of the hills above 900&nbsp;metres (3000&nbsp;ft) in southern Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It resembles ''simillimus'', but the male is uniform slate brown.<ref name="HBW1"/>
*''T. m. kinnisii'', named for [[John Kinnis]], surgeon to the [[Great Britain|British]] military forces in what was then Ceylon, breeds in the hills of [[Sri Lanka]] above 900&nbsp;metres (3000&nbsp;ft). The male is uniformly blue-grey, and the female is similar but browner.<ref name=India/> Size as in ''nigropileus'', but eye-ring more reddish-orange.

The taxonomy, especially of the Asian [[subspecies]], is complex. The subspecies from most of the [[Indian subcontinent]], ''simillimus'', ''nigropileus'', ''bourdilloni'', ''spencei'', and ''kinnissi'', are small, only 19<U+2013>20 centimetres (7.5<U+2013>8 in) long, and have broad eye-rings. They also differ in proportions, wing formula, egg colour and voice from the other subspecies of the Blackbird. They are therefore sometimes considered a separate species, the Indian Blackbird (''T. simillimus'').<ref name="HBW1">Collar, N. J. (2005). Indian Blackbird (''Turdus simillimus'').

It differs from all other subspecies of the Blackbird by its complete lack of eye-ring and reduced song. It is therefore sometimes considered a full species, the Tibetan Blackbird (''T. maximus'').<ref name="HBW2">Collar, N. J. (2005). Tibetan Blackbird (''Turdus maximus'').

==Distribution and habitat==
The Blackbird breeds in temperate [[Eurasia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Canary Islands]], and [[South Asia]]. It has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand.<ref name = Clement/> Populations are [[sedentary]] in the south and west of the range, although northern birds [[bird migration|migrate]] south as far as northern Africa and tropical Asia in winter.<ref name= Clement >{{cite book |title=Thrushes (Helm Identification Guides)  |last= Clement |first= Peter |coauthors= Hathway, Ren;  Wilczur, Jan |publisher=Christopher Helm Publishers Ltd|year=2000 |id= ISBN 0-7136-3940-7}}</ref> Urban males are more likely to [[overwinter]] in cooler climes than rural males, an adaptation made feasible by the warmer microclimate and relatively abundant food that allow the birds to establish territories and start reproducing earlier in the year.<ref>Partecke, J. & E.

Common over most of its range in woodland, the Blackbird has a preference for deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less.<ref name = Snow>{{cite book |title=A Study of Blackbirds  |last= Snow |first= David |coauthors=  |publisher= British Museum (Natural History) |year=1988 |id= ISBN 0-7136-3940-7}}</ref> They are often replaced by the related Ring Ouzel in areas of higher altitude.<ref name=Observerbirdseggs>{{cite book |title=The Observer's Book of Birds' Eggs|author=Evans G|pages=p. 78|year=1972 |publisher=Warne |location=London |isbn=0-7232-0060-2}}</ref>

The Blackbird occurs up to 1000&nbsp;metres (3300&nbsp;ft) in Europe, 2300&nbsp;metres (7590&nbsp;ft) in North Africa, and at 900&ndash;820&nbsp;metres (3000&ndash;6000&nbsp;ft) in peninsular India and Sri Lanka, but the large Himalayan subspecies range much higher, with ''T. m. maximus'' breeding at 3200&ndash;4800&nbsp;metres (10560&ndash;16000&nbsp;ft) and remaining above 2100&nbsp;metres (6930&nbsp;ft) even in winter.<ref name=Clement/>

This widespread species has occurred as a vagrant in many locations in Eurasia outside its normal range, but records from [[North America]] are normally considered to involve escapees, including, for example, the 1971 bird in [[Quebec]].<ref name = McNeil >{{cite journal ||last=McNeil |first=Raymond |coauthors= Cyr, Andr<U+00E9> |month=October |year=1971 |title=[http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v088n04/p0919-p0920.pdf General Notes: European Blackbird (''Turdus merula'') in Quebec] |journal= The Auk |volume=88 |issue= 4|pages= 919<U+2013>920}}</ref> However, a 1994 record from [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista, Newfoundland]] has been accepted as a genuine wild bird,<ref name = Clement/> and the species is therefore on the [[list of North American birds|North American list]].<ref name =AOU>{{cite web|title= The A.O.U.

===Status===
The Blackbird has an extensive range, estimated at 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (3.8&nbsp;million square miles), and a large population, including an estimated 79 to 160 million individuals in Europe alone. The species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as [[Least Concern]].<ref name =IUCN/> In the western [[Palaearctic]], populations are generally stable or increasing,<ref name=BWP>{{cite book | last = Snow   | first =  David  |coauthors= Perrins, Christopher M  (editors)| title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998| location =Oxford | isbn = 0-19-854099-X }} p1215<U+2013>1218</ref> but there have been local declines, especially on farmland, which may be due to agricultural policies that encouraged farmers to remove hedgerows (which provide nesting places), and to drain damp grassland and increase the use of [[pesticide]]s, both of which could have reduced the availability of invertebrate food.<ref name = RSPB>{{cite web|title= Threats|work=Blackbird |url= http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/b/blackbird/threats_dangers_and_survival.asp |publisher=Royal Society for the Protection of Birds |accessdate=2007-12-19}}</ref>

The Blackbird was introduced to Australia at [[Melbourne]] in the 1850s, but has expanded from its initial foothold in Melbourne and [[Adelaide]] to occur throughout south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]] and the [[Bass Strait]] islands.<ref name =backyard>{{cite web|title= Common Blackbird |work= Birds in Backyards |url= http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/finder/display.cfm?id=123|publisher= Australian Museum |accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> The introduced population in Australia is considered a pest because it damages a variety of soft fruits in orchards, parks and gardens including berries, cherries, stone fruit and grapes. It is thought to spread weeds, such as [[blackberry]], and may compete with native birds for food and nesting sites.<ref name = Oz>{{cite web|title= Blackbird |work= Farmnote 60/2001, reviewed 2005 |url= http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/content/pw/vp/bird/f06001.pdf |publisher= Department of Agriculture, Western Australia |accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>

The introduced Blackbird is, together with the native [[Silvereye]] (''Zosterops lateralis''), the most widely distributed avian seed disperser in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the [[Song Thrush]] (''Turdus philomelos'') in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|ft|0}}, as well as outlying islands such as the [[Campbell Island group|Campbell]] and [[Kermadec Islands|Kermadecs]].<ref name = "Fallaetal79">Falla, R.

==Behaviour==
The male Blackbird defends its breeding territory, chasing away other males or utilising a "bow and run" threat display. This consists of a short run, the head  first being raised and then bowed with the tail dipped simultaneously. If a fight between male Blackbirds does occur, it is usually short and the intruder is soon chased away. The female Blackbird is also aggressive in the spring when it competes with other females for a good nesting territory, and although fights are less frequent, they tend to be more violent.<ref name= Snow/>  

The bill<U+2019>s appearance is important in the interactions of the Blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively indifferent to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.<ref name = AB64 >{{cite journal ||last= Bright  |first= Ashleigh. |coauthors= Waas,  Joseph R.|month=August |year=2002 |title= [http://cber.bio.waikato.ac.nz/images/bbposter2.pdf Effects of bill pigmentation and UV reflectance during territory establishment in blackbirds ]  |journal= Animal Behaviour |volume=64 |issue= 2|pages=207<U+2013>213|doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.3042}}</ref>

As long as winter food is available, both the male and female will remain in the territory throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.<ref name= BWP/>
===Breeding===
[[Image:Jajka.JPG|thumb|Eggs]]The male Blackbird attracts the female with a courtship display which consists of oblique runs combined with head-bowing movements, an open beak, and a "strangled" low song. The female remains motionless until she raises her head and tail to permit copulation.<ref name = Snow/> This species is monogamous, and the established pair will stay together as long as they both survive.<ref name = BWP/>

Nominate ''T. merula'' may commence breeding in March, but eastern and Indian races are a month or more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August.<ref name=Clement/><ref name= Observerbirdseggs/> The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as [[ivy]], [[holly]], [[crataegus|hawthorn]], [[honeysuckle]] or [[pyracantha]],<ref name = NatEngland/> and the female builds a neat cup-shaped [[bird nest|nest]] from grasses and similar vegetation, which she then lines with mud or muddy leaves.  She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] marked with reddish-brown blotches,<ref name = Snow/> heaviest at the larger end;<ref name=Observerbirdseggs/> the eggs of nominate ''T. merula'' are 2.9 x 2.1&nbsp;centimetres (1.14 x 0.93&nbsp;in) in size and weigh 7.2&nbsp;grammes (0.25&nbsp;oz), of which 6% is shell.<ref name = BTO>{{cite web|title= Blackbird ''Turdus merula'' [Linnaeus, 1758] |work= BTO''Web'' BirdFacts|url= http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob11870.htm |publisher=British Trust for Ornithology |accessdate=2007-12-30}}</ref> Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.<ref name = Clement/> 
[[Image:Sg fexx 19.JPG|thumb|Chicks]]
The female incubates for 12<U+2013>14 days before the [[altricial]] chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10<U+2013>19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and removing faecal sacs.<ref name = BWP/> The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young.<ref name = Snow/> Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the Blackbird's range.<ref name = Clement/>

Montane subspecies, such as ''T. maximus'' have a shorter breeding season, smaller clutches (2<U+2013>4 eggs, averaging 2.86), but larger eggs than ''merula''. They produce just one brood per year, and have a slightly shorter incubation period of 12<U+2013>13 days, but a longer nestling period (16<U+2013>18 days).<ref name= maximus>{{cite journal ||last= Xin Lu |first= |coauthors= |month= January |year= 2005|title= Reproductive ecology of blackbirds (''Turdus merula maximus'') in a high-altitude location, Tibet |journal= Journal of Ornithology|volume=146 |issue=1 |pages= 72<U+2013>78| doi=10.1007/s10336-004-0058-1}}</ref>

===Songs and calls===
[[Image:Blackbird tree.jpg|thumb|Singing male<br />{{audio|Turdus merula 2.ogg|Song}}|110px]]
The first-year male Blackbird of the nominate race may start singing as early as late January in fine weather in order to establish a territory, followed in late March by the adult male. The male's song is a varied and melodious low-pitched fluted warble, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches mainly in the period from March to June, sometimes into the beginning of July.  It has a number of other calls, including an aggressive ''seee'', a ''pook-pook-pook'' alarm for terrestrial predators like cats, and various ''chink'' and ''chook, chook'' vocalisations. The territorial male invariably gives ''chink-chink'' calls in the evening in an (usually unsuccessful) attempt to deter other Blackbirds from roosting in its territory overnight.<ref name=Snow/> Like other passerine birds, it has a thin high ''seee'' alarm call for threats from [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] since the  sound is rapidly attenuated in vegetation, making the source difficult to locate.<ref name= burton>{{cite book | last = Burton| first = Robert| coauthors= |title = Bird behaviour| year =  1985|location= London| publisher = Granada | page = p125|isbn = 0-24-612440-7}}</ref>

At least two subspecies, nominate ''T. merula'' and ''T. nigropileus'' of India, will mimic birds, cats, humans or alarms, but this is usually quiet and hard to detect. The large mountain races, especially ''T. maximus'', have comparatively poor songs, with a limited repertoire compared with the western, peninsular Indian and Sri Lankan [[taxon|taxa]].<ref name=Clement/>

===Feeding===
The Blackbird is [[omnivorous]], eating a wide range of [[insect]]s, [[earthworm]]s, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other [[invertebrate]]s. Small [[vertebrate]]s such as frogs, tadpoles and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect [[caterpillar]]s and other active insects.<ref name= Snow/> Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens. In northern India, [[banyan]] and [[mulberry]] fruits are frequently eaten, with ''[[Erythrina]]'' and ''[[Trema]]'' species featuring further south.<ref name= Clement/>

==Natural threats==
[[Image:Blackbird and Kestrel.jpg|upright|thumb|A male attempting to distract a male [[Common Kestrel|Kestrel]] close to its nest]]
The main predator of the Blackbird is the domestic [[cat]], but [[fox]]es and predatory birds, such as the [[Sparrowhawk]] and other [[accipiter]]s, also take this species when the opportunity arises.<ref name = Lambeth>{{cite web|title= Blackbird Action Plan |work=  |url= http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/A862EBE6-4CD7-4317-9B64-D0FB565AAF1C/0/BAPSummaryBlackbird.pdf |publisher= Lambeth Council<U+2019>s Parks and Greenspaces Business Unit  |accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref><ref name=RSPB/> In contrast, there is little direct evidence to show that either predation of the adult Blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to [[corvus|corvids]], such as the [[European Magpie]] or [[Eurasian Jay]], have a direct impact on population numbers.<ref name = NatEngland>{{cite web|title = Blackbird - ''Turdus merula'' |work=  Plantpress |url= http://www.plantpress.com/wildlife/o30-blackbird.php |publisher= Natural England |accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>

This species is occasionally a host of [[brood parasite|parasitic]] [[cuckoo]]s, such as the [[Common Cuckoo]] (''Cuculus canorus''), but this is minimal because the Blackbird recognizes the adult of the parasitic species and its [[mimicry|non-mimetic]] eggs.<ref name = BB95 >{{cite journal |last= Davies  |first= N.

As with other passerine birds, parasites are common. 88% of blackbirds were found to have intestinal parasites, most frequently ''[[Isospora]]'' and ''Capillaria'' species.<ref> Misof, Katharina (2005) "[http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=978109996&dok_var=d1&dok_ext=pdf&filename=978109996.pdf Eurasian Blackbirds (Turdus merula) and their gastrointestinal parasites: A role for parasites in life-history decisions?]" ''Doctoral dissertation'', Bonn, August 2005</ref> and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites.<ref> Hatchwell, B.

==In culture==

The Blackbird's melodious, distinctive song is the theme of the poem ''Adelstrop'' by [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]]; 
<blockquote>And for that minute a blackbird sang<br />

The song is also recalled in the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] track ''[[Blackbird (song)|Blackbird]]'': 
<blockquote>
