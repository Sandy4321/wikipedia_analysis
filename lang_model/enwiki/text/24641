'''William I''' (''[[circa]]'' 1028<ref name=Bates33>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 33</ref>&nbsp;<U+2013> 9&nbsp;September 1087), also known as '''William the Conqueror''' or '''William the Bastard''',<ref name=DNB/>{{efn|He was only known as "the Bastard" in non-Norman sources.<ref name=DNB/>}} was the first [[Normans|Norman]] [[English monarchy|King of England]], who reigned from 1066 until his death in 1087. He was also [[Duke of Normandy]] from 3&nbsp;July 1035 until his death, under the name '''William II'''. Descended from [[Viking]] raiders, William faced a number of difficulties when he became duke at the age of 7 or 8, but by 1060 he had established his hold over Normandy and was able to invade and conquer [[England]] in 1066.

William was the only child of Duke [[Robert the Magnificent]] of Normandy and [[Herleva]], who were not married, making William [[illegitimate]], which created some difficulties for him when he succeeded his father in 1035 as duke. Other problems were his young age, and the anarchy which plagued his first years as duke. During his childhood and adolescence, the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047, William was able to defeat a rebellion, and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to [[Matilda of Flanders]] aided his efforts, and by the 1050s William was able to appoint his own choices as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 William was able to secure control of the neighboring county of [[Maine (province)|Maine]].

In the 1050s and early 1060s, William became a contender for the throne of England, then held by his childless relative, [[Edward the Confessor]]. There were other possible claimants, however, including the powerful English earl [[Harold Godwinson]], who was named the next king by Edward on Edward's deathbed in January 1066. William contested this, and argued that Edward had earlier promised the throne to himself and that Harold had sworn to support William's claim. After building a large fleet, William invaded England in September 1066 and decisively defeated Harold at the [[Battle of Hastings]] on 14 October 1066, killing Harold and a number of his supporters. After some further military efforts, William was crowned king on Christmas Day, 1066 at London. He then made arrangements for the governance of England in early 1067 before returning to Normandy. A number of rebellions followed, but William was able to put them down and by 1075 his hold on England was mostly secure.

The last years of William's reign were marked by difficulties in his continental domains, troubles with his eldest son, and threatened invasions of England. In 1086 William ordered the compilation of ''[[Domesday Book]]'', a survey listing all the landholders in England along with their holdings. William died in September 1087 while leading a campaign in northern France, and was buried in Caen. His reign in England was marked by the construction of castles, the settling of a new Norman nobility on the land, and change in the composition of the English clergy. He did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire, instead continuing to administer each part as a separate government. After his death, William's lands were divided, with Normandy going to his eldest son and his second surviving son receiving England.

==Background==
[[File:Cronological tree william I.svg|thumb|350px|left|A simplified family tree showing some of William's ancestors and relatives.]]

[[Vikings|Norsemen]] first began raiding in what became [[Normandy]] in the later 8th century. Permanent settlement occurred sometime before 911, when an agreement between [[Rollo]], one of the Viking leaders, and King [[Charles the Simple]] of France was reached which surrendered the [[Duchy of Normandy|county of Rouen]] to Rollo, although whether Rollo took the title is unclear. These lands around Rouen became the core of the later duchy of Normandy.<ref name=Collins376>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' pp. 376<U+2013>377</ref> In the later part of the 10th century, Danish and other Vikings resumed raiding the shores of England and they may have used Normandy as a base of operations. If they did use Normandy in this manner, it would have contributed to the worsening of relations between England and Normandy, in which the papacy under [[Pope John XV]] took a hand by mediating a peace treaty in March 991, whereby Duke [[Richard I of Normandy|Richard of Normandy]] and King [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready|<U+00C6>thelred II of England]] agreed to not shelter the enemies of the other.<ref name=Williams42>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> Danish raids continued, however,<ref name=Williams48>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' p. 48</ref> and in 1002, <U+00C6>thelred tried again to stem the ability of the raiders using Normandy by marrying [[Emma of Normandy]], daughter of Duke Richard I, and sister of the current duke, [[Richard II of Normandy|Richard II]].<ref name=Williams54>Williams ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'' pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref>

Although the marriage was meant to help eliminate the raids and improve relations between the duchy and the kingdom, it doesn't appear to have worked completely. The Danes under King [[Swein Forkbeard]] continued to raid England, and may have come to an agreement with Duke Richard to sell the English plunder only in Normandy in exchange for allowing the Danish wounded to recover in Normandy. <U+00C6>thelred, however, also sought help from Richard, taking refuge in Normandy in 1013 when Swein drove <U+00C6>thelred and his family from England. Swein's death in 1014 allowed <U+00C6>thelred to return to England, but Swein's son [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] contested <U+00C6>thelred's return. <U+00C6>thelred himself died unexpectedly in 1016 and Cnut became king of England. <U+00C6>thelred and Emma's two sons, [[Edward the Confessor|Edward]] and [[Alfred Aetheling|Alfred]] remained in exile in Normandy while their mother, Emma, married Cnut as his second wife.<ref name=Conquest80>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 80<U+2013>83</ref>

When Cnut died in 1035, his son by his first wife [[Harold Harefoot]] succeeded in England while his son by Emma, [[Harthacnut]], became king in Denmark. England remained unstable, however, and Alfred returned to England to visit his mother, and perhaps challenge Harold as king in 1036. Alfred, however, was killed, with one story implicating Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]], and others blaming Harold for Alfred's death. Emma then went into exile in [[Flanders]], but in 1040, Harold died and Harthacnut became king, and he summoned both his mother and his half-brother Edward to England. When Harthacnut died in June 1042, Edward was proclaimed king before Harthacnut was buried.<ref name=Conquest83>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 83<U+2013>85</ref>{{efn|Although the chronicler William of Poitiers claimed that Edward's succession was due to Duke William's efforts, this is highly unlikely, as William was at that time practically powerless in his own duchy.<ref name=DNB/>}}

==Early life==
[[File:Falaise chateau guillaume conquerant 1.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Falaise]] in [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], Calvados, France, was the birthplace of William.]]

William was born in either 1027 or 1028 in [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], Normandy, France, most likely in the autumn of the later year.<ref name="Bates33"/><ref name=Handbook34>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 34</ref><ref name=Official>"[http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheNormans/WilliamItheConqueror.aspx William the Conqueror]" ''History of the Monarchy''</ref>{{efn|The exact date of William's birth is confused by contradictory statements by the Norman chroniclers. [[Orderic Vitalis]] has William on his deathbed claim that he was 64 years old, which would place his birth around 1023. But elsewhere, Orderic states that William was 8 years old when he father left for Jerusalem in 1035, giving a birthdate around 1027. [[William of Malmesbury]] gives an age of 7 for William when his father left, making the birthdate around 1028. Another source, the ''[[De Obitu Willelmi]]'', states that William was 59 years old when he died in 1087, giving a birth date around 1028 or 1029.<ref name=Douglas379>Douglas ''William the Conqueor'' pp. 379<U+2013>382</ref>}}  William was the only son of [[Robert I, Duke of Normandy]]. His mother, [[Herleva]] was the daughter of [[Fulbert of Falaise]], who may have been a tanner or embalmer.<ref name=Douglas379/> Herleva, who did not marry Robert, may possibly have been a member of the ducal household.<ref name=DNB/> She later married [[Herluin de Conteville]] and had two sons with Herluin&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Odo of Bayeux]] and [[Robert, Count of Mortain]]. Herluin and Herleva also had a daughter, whose name is not recorded, who married William, lord of [[La Fert<U+00E9>-Mac<U+00E9>]]. Herleva also had a daughter, [[Adelaide of Normandy]], possibly another child of Robert's but all that is known for sure is that Adelaide was not the daughter of Herluin. Besides William's half-siblings (or in the case of Adelaide, possibly full sister), Herleva also had two brothers&nbsp;<U+2013> Osbern and Walter, with Walter being one of William's supporters and protectors during his minority.<ref name=Douglas379/>{{efn|Walter had two daughters. One became a nun, but the other daughter Matilda married [[Ralph Tesson]].<ref name=Douglas379/>}}

Robert, William's father, became Duke of Normandy on 6 August 1027, in succession to his elder brother [[Richard III, Duke of Normandy|Richard III]], who had only succeeded to the title in 1026, after the death of Richard and Robert's father [[Richard II, Duke of Normandy|Richard II]].<ref name=Bates33/> Robert and the younger Richard had been at odds over the succession, and Richard's death was very sudden. Robert was accused by some writers of killing his brother, a possible but unprovable charge. Richard had left a young son, Nicholas, who immediately was made a monk at his father's death while his uncle became duke.<ref name=Douglas31>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 31<U+2013>32</ref> Conditions in Normandy were unsettled when Robert became duke, with noble families despoiling the church and a war with [[Alan III of Brittany]], who perhaps hoped to take control of Normandy. In 1028, Duke Robert besieged his uncle, [[Robert II (Archbishop of Rouen)|Robert]], the [[Archbishop of Rouen]], and forced the archbishop into exile. However, by 1031, the duke and archbishop had reconciled, and with the archbishop's help, Alan and the duke reached a truce which may have included Alan's performance of [[homage]] to the duke. Archbishop Robert then became one of the strongest supporters of Duke Robert, and was joined by a number of noblemen who were to rise to prominence during William's life. Included among these noblemen were [[Osbern the Steward|Osbern]], a nephew of [[Gunnora, Duchess of Normandy|Gunnor]] the wife of Duke Richard I, and Count [[Gilbert, Count of Brionne|Gilbert of Brionne]], who was a grandson of Richard I.<ref name=Douglas32>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 32<U+2013>34, 145</ref> Robert also supported the exiled English princes - Edward and Alfred, who were still in exile in northern France.<ref name=DNB/>

There are indications that Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut of Denmark and England, but no marriage took place. If he had married, it is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession, for earlier dukes had been [[illegitimate]] and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most probable heir.<ref name=DNB/> In 1034, Duke Robert decided to go on [[pilgrimage]] to Jerusalem. Although a number of his supporters tried to dissuade him from going, pointing out that there was no heir. Robert convened a council and had the assembled Norman magnates swear fealty to William as his heir. Robert then departed on his journey and died in early July 1035 at [[<U+0130>znik|Nicea]] while returning to Normandy.<ref name=Douglas35>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 35<U+2013>37</ref>

==Duke of Normandy==
===Challenges===
The new duke faced a number of challenges, including his illegitimate birth and his young age,<ref name=Douglas37>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 37</ref> which is variously given as either eight years old<ref name=Bates36>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 36</ref> or the slightly younger seven years of age.<ref name=Douglas37/> William enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, [[Henry I of France|Henry I]], and this enabled the young duke to succeed to his father's duchy.<ref name=Douglas38/> The support that was given to the attempt by the exiled English princes to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue the policies of his father.<ref name=DNB/> But Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supports, and conditions in Normandy descended into chaos quickly.<ref name=Douglas38>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> The anarchy in the duchy lasted until 1047,<ref name=Douglas51>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 51</ref> and control of the young duke was one of the prime concerns of those contending for power. At first, Alan of Brittany had custody of the duke, but when Alan died in either late 1039 or October 1040, Gilbert of Brionne took control of William. Gilbert was killed within months, and another guardian, Turchetil was also killed around the time of Gilbert's death.<ref name=Douglas40>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 40</ref> Another guardian, Osbern, was killed in the early 1040s in William's sleeping chamber while the duke was sleeping. Walter, William's maternal uncle, was occasionally forced to hide the young duke in peasant houses.<ref name=Bates37>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 37</ref> Although many of the Norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feuds during William's minority, the viscounts still acknowledged the ducal government and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of William also.<ref name=Douglas42>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> 

[[File:Colonne Vimont.jpg|Column at the site of the [[Battle of Val-<U+00E8>s-Dunes]]|thumb|250px|left]]

King Henry continued to give support to the young duke, helping at a siege in the early 1040s.<ref name=Douglas45>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref> In late 1046, however, forces opposed to William began to come together in a co-ordinated rebellion centered in lower Normandy and led by [[Alice of Normandy#Family|Guy of Burgundy]], with the further support from Nigel, viscount of the Cotentin and Rannulf, viscount of the Bessin. According to stories which may have legendary elements, an attempt was made to seize William at Valognes, but the duke escaped by night and made his way to King Henry to ask for help.<ref name=Douglas47>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 47<U+2013>49</ref> However the French king's support was gained, in early 1047 Henry and William returned to Normandy and fought the [[Battle of Val-<U+00E8>s-Dunes]] near [[Caen]], which was won by William and Henry, although few details of the actual fighting are recorded.<ref name=Bates38>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 38</ref> Although William of Poitiers claimed that the battle was won mainly through William's efforts, earlier accounts make the much more plausible statement that King Henry's men and leadership were important also.<ref name=DNB/> The battle marked William's assumption of authority in Normandy, and he marked it by promulgating the [[Truce of God]] throughout Normandy shortly after the battle.<ref name=Bates40>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 40</ref> Although the battle marked a turning point in William's control of the duchy, it was not the end of William's struggles to gain the upper hand over his nobles. The period from 1047 to 1054 saw almost continuous warfare and smaller crises continued up until 1060.<ref name=Douglas53>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 53</ref>

===Consolidation of power===
William's first efforts were against Guy of Burgundy, who retreated to his castle at [[Brionne]], which William was forced to besiege it, and the duke only succeeded in exiling Guy in 1050.<ref name=Douglas54>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref> Another problem was the growing power of [[Geoffrey Martel]], the count of [[Anjou]].<ref name=Douglas56/> William joined with King Henry in a campaign against Anjou, but this was the last known cooperation between William and the French king. Although the campaign captured an Angevin fortress, little else was accomplished.<ref name=Bates43>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref> Geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of [[Maine (province)|Maine]], especially after the death of [[Hugh IV of Maine]] in 1051. Central to the control of Maine was the holdings of the family of [[Bell<U+00EA>me family|Bell<U+00EA>me]], who held [[Bell<U+00EA>me]] on the border of Maine and Normandy.<ref name=Douglas56>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 56<U+2013>58</ref> On the death of Hugh of Maine, Geoffrey of Anjou occupied Maine, but this move was contested by William and King Henry, and eventually they managed to drive Geoffrey from Maine. In the process, William was able to secure the strongholds at [[Alen<U+00E7>on]] and [[Domfort]] for himself.<ref name=Douglas59>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 59<U+2013>60</ref> In 1052, however, the king and Geoffrey of Anjou made common cause against William at the same time as some Norman nobles began to contest the growing power of William.<ref name=Douglas63>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 63</ref> Throughout 1053, William was involved in military actions against his own nobles,<ref name=Douglas66>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref> as well as the new Archbishop of Rouen, [[Mauger (archbishop)|Mauger]].<ref name=Douglas64>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 64</ref> In February 1054 both the king and the Norman rebels launched a double invasion of the duchy. The main thrust was led by Henry and came through the county of <U+00C9>vreux while the other wing, under the French king's brother [[Robert II of France#Children|Odo]], invaded eastern Normandy.<ref name=Douglas67>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 67</ref>

William met the invasion by dividing his forces into two groups. The first group, which he led, faced the Henry, while the second, which included a number of men who became firm supporters of William such as [[Counts of Eu|Robert, Count of Eu]], [[Walter Giffard, 1st Earl of Buckingham|Walter Giffard]], [[Roger of Mortemer]], and [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]], faced the other invading force. This second force defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Mortemer]]. Besides ending both invasions, the battle also allowed the ecclesiastical supporters of the duke to depose Mauger from the archbishopric of Rouen. Thus, Mortemer marked another turning point in William's growing control of the duchy,<ref name=Douglas68>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref> but fighting with the French king as well as the Count of Anjou continued until 1060, when Henry died in August and Geoffrey of Anjou died in November.<ref name=Douglas75>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> Henry and Geoffrey led another invasion of Normandy in 1057, but were defeated by William at the [[Battle of Varaville]]. This was the last invasion into Normandy during William's lifetime, and the deaths of the count and the king cemented the shift in the balance of power towards William.<ref name=Bates50>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 50</ref>

[[File:Acrdwnch.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The signatures of William I and Matilda are the first two large crosses on the [[Accord of Winchester]] from 1072.]]

One factor that helped William was his marriage to [[Matilda of Flanders]], the daughter of Count [[Baldwin V of Flanders]]. The marriage was arranged in 1049, but [[Pope Leo IX]] forbade the marriage at the [[Council of Rheims]] in October 1049. But the marriage went forward during the early 1050s,<ref name=Douglas76>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 76</ref>{{efn|The exact date of the marriage is unknown, but it likely occurred sometime in 1051 or 1052. It was definitely completed before the end of 1053, as Matilda is named in [[charter]] dated in the later part of that year as William's wife.<ref name=Douglas391>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 391</ref>}} possibly without papal sanction. According to a late source, papal approval was not secured until 1059, but the source for this is not considered generally reliable. Further corroboration is the fact that papal-Norman relations in the 1050s were generally good, with Norman clergy visiting Rome in 1050 without incident.<ref name=Bates44>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref> Papal sanction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in Caen&nbsp;<U+2013> one by William and one by Matilda.<ref name=Douglas80>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 80</ref>{{efn|The two monasteries are [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes|St Etienne]] for men which was founded by William around 1059, and [[Abbaye aux Dames|La Trinite]] for women which was founded by Matilda around 1063.<ref name=Bates66>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref>}} The marriage itself was important in bolstering William's power, as Flanders was one of the more powerful French territories, with ties to the French royal house as well as to the German emperors.<ref name=Bates44/> Contemporary writers considered the marriage to be a success and it produced four sons and five or six daughters over time.<ref name=Douglas393/>

===Physical appearance and character===

No authentic portrait of William has been found, with the contemporary depictions of him on the Bayeux Tapestry and on his seals and coins being stylized portraits designed to assert his authority.<ref name=Bates115>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 115<U+2013>116</ref> However, there are some written descriptions of his appearance which describe him as burly and robust with a guttural voice. He enjoyed excellent health until old age; but he became quite fat in later life.<ref name=Douglas368>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 368<U+2013>369</ref> He was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina. Examination of his [[femur]], the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately {{convert|5|ft|10|in|m}} tall, quite tall for the time period.<ref name=Bates115/>

There are records of two tutors for the young duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's literary education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, and little evidence of sponsoring scholarship or other intellectual activities. His main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her - unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticized William for his greed and his cruelty. His personal piety, however, was universally praised by contemporaries.<ref name=DNB/>

===Norman administration===

Norman government under William was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes. This was a fairly simple administrative system, which was built around the ducal household.<ref name=Bates133>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 133</ref> The household consisted of a group of officers such as [[Butler|stewards]], [[butler]]s, and [[marshal]]ls.<ref name=Bates23>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref> The duke travelled constantly around the duchy, confirming [[charter]]s and collecting revenues.<ref name=Bates63>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 63<U+2013>65</ref> Most of the income came from the ducal lands as well as tolls, and a few taxes. This income was collected by the chamber, one of the household departments.<ref name=Bates23/>

William cultivated close relations with the church in his duchy. He took part in church councils, and made a number of appointments to the Norman episcopate, including the appointment of [[Maurilius]] as Archbishop of Rouen.<ref name=Bates64/> Another important appointment was that of William's half-brother Odo as [[Bishop of Bayeux]] in either 1049 or 1050.<ref name=DNB/> He also relied on a number of the clergy for advice, including [[Lanfranc]], a non-Norman who rose to become one of William's prominent ecclesiastical advisors in the late 1040s and remained so throughout the 1050s and 1060s. Besides the two monasteries founded by William and Matilda in Caen to appease the papacy, William also gave generously to the church.<ref name=Bates64>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 64<U+2013>66</ref> William himself founded no new monasteries besides the two in Caen prior to 1066, but during from 1035 to 1066, the Norman aristocracy founded at least 20 new monastic houses, a remarkable expansion of religious life in the duchy.<ref name=Douglas111>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref>

==English and continental concerns==

In 1051, King Edward of England appears to have decided that William was to be his successor on the English throne. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', in the "D" version, goes so far as to state that William visited England in the later part of 1051, perhaps to secure confirmation of the succession,<ref name=Bates46/> or perhaps William was attempting to secure aid for his troubles in Normandy.<ref name=Huscroft93/> The trip is unlikely given William's absorption in warfare with Anjou at the time. Whatever Edward's wishes, it was likely that any claim by William would be opposed by Godwin, the [[Earl of Wessex]] and his family, who were the most powerful family in England.<ref name=Bates46>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref> Edward had married [[Edith of Wessex|Edith]], Godwin's daughter, in 1043, and Godwin appears to have been one of the main supporters of Edward's claim to the throne.<ref name=Huscroft86>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 86<U+2013>87</ref> But by 1050, relations between the king and the earl had soured, which in 1051 broke into a crisis that led to Godwin and his family's exile from England. It was during this exile that Edward offered the throne to William.<ref name=Huscroft89>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 89<U+2013>91</ref> Godwin, however, returned from exile in 1052 with armed forces and a settlement was reached between the king and the earl, with the earl and his family being restored to their lands and the replacement of [[Robert of Jumi<U+00E8>ges]], a Norman who Edward had named [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with [[Stigand]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]].<ref name=Huscroft95>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 95<U+2013>96</ref> No English source mentions a supposed embassy by Archbishop Robert to William conveying the promise of the succession, and the two Norman sources which mention it, [[William of Jumi<U+00E8>ges]] and [[William of Poitiers]], are not precise on their chronology of when this visit took place.<ref name=Huscroft93>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 93<U+2013>95</ref>

In 1062, Count [[Herbert II of Maine]] died, and William, who had betrothed his eldest son [[Robert Curthose|Robert]] to the sister of Herbert, claimed the county through his son. This was resisted by the local nobles, but William invaded the county and by 1064 had secured control of the area.<ref name=Douglas174>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 174</ref> William appointed a Norman to the [[Diocese of Le Mans|bishopric of Le Mans]] in 1065 as well as allowing his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new count of Anjou, [[Geoffrey III, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey the Bearded]].<ref name=Bates53>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 53</ref> This secured William's western border but the border with Brittany was still insecure. In 1064 William invaded Brittany, in a campaign which remains obscure in its details. The effect, however, was to foster instability inside Brittany, forcing the duke, [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany|Conan II]], to focus on internal problems rather than expansion. When Conan died in 1066, this further secured William's borders in Normandy. William benefited another way from his actions in Brittany, as he had secured the support of a number of Breton nobles, some of whom went on to support the invasion of England in 1066.<ref name=Douglas178>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 178<U+2013>179</ref>

Meanwhile in England, Earl Godwin died in 1053 and his sons became powerful, with [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] succeeding to his father's earldom and another son, [[Tostig Godwinson|Tostig]] becoming [[Earl of Northumbria]]. Other sons were granted earldoms later: [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]] as [[Earl of East Anglia]] in 1057 and [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]] as [[Earl of Kent]] sometime between 1055 and 1057.<ref name=Huscroft98>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 98<U+2013>100</ref> Some sources claim that Harold took part in William's Breton campaign of 1064 and that Harold swore to uphold William's claim to the English throne at the end of the campaign.<ref name=Bates53/> However, no English source reports this trip, and it is unclear if it actually occurred. It may have been Norman propaganda designed to discredit Harold, who had emerged as the main contender to succeed King Edward.<ref name=Huscroft102>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 102<U+2013>103</ref> Meanwhile, another contender for the throne had emerged&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Edward the Exile]], son of [[Edmund Ironside]] and a grandson of <U+00C6>thelred II, returned to England in 1057, and although he died shortly after his return, he brought with him his family, which included two daughters [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]] and [[Cristina, daughter of Edward the Exile|Christina]] and a son, [[Edgar the <U+00C6>theling]].<ref name=Huscroft97>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 97</ref>{{efn|<U+00C6>theling means "prince of the royal house" and usually denoted a son or brother of a ruling king.<ref name=BASEAetheling>Miller "<U+00C6>theling" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref>}}

In 1065, Northumbria revolted against Tostig, and the rebels chose [[Morcar]], the younger brother of [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin]], [[Earl of Mercia]], as earl in place of Tostig. Harold, perhaps to secure the support of Edwin and Morcar in his bid for the throne, supported the rebels, and persuaded King Edward to replace Tostig with Morcar. Tostig went into exile in Flanders, along with his wife [[Judith of Flanders, Countess of Northumbria|Judith]], who was the daughter of Count [[Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders|Baldwin IV of Flanders]]. Edward was ailing, and died on 5 January 1066. It is unclear what exactly happened at Edward's deathbed. One story, deriving from the ''[[Vita Edwardi]]'', claims that Edward was attended by his wife Edith, Harold, Archbishop Stigand, and [[Robert FitzWimarc]] and that the king named Harold as his successor. The Norman sources do not dispute the fact that Harold was named as the next king, but declare that Harold's oath and Edward's earlier promise of the throne could not be changed on Edward's deathbed. Later English sources stated that Harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnates of England.<ref name=Huscroft107>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 107<U+2013>109</ref>

==Invasion of England==
{{Main|Norman conquest of England}}

===Harold's preparations===
[[File:Harold Godwinson silver coin.jpg|thumb|right|Silver penny of Harold]]
Harold was crowned on 6 January 1066 at Westminster Abbey, although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony. English sources claim that [[Ealdred (bishop)|Ealdred]], the [[Archbishop of York]] performed the ceremony, but Norman sources state that the coronation was performed by Stigand, who was considered a non-canonical archbishop by the papacy.<ref name=Huscroft115>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 115<U+2013>116</ref> His claim was not secure, however, and there were four main claimants to the English throne&nbsp;<U+2013> Harold himself and his exiled brother Tostig, who also seems to have claimed the throne, were the two main English claimants.<ref name=Ruling12>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>{{efn|Edgar the <U+00C6>theling was another claimant,<ref name=Bates78>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 78</ref> but Edgar was young,<ref name=Thomas18>Thomas ''Norman Conquest'' p. 18</ref> likely only 14 in 1066.<ref name=Conquest132>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 132</ref>}} King [[Harold Hardrada]] of Norway also had a claim to the throne based on Hardrada being the nephew and heir of King [[Magnus I of Norway|Magnus I]] who had made a pact with Harthacnut around 1040 that if either Magnus or Harthacnut died without heirs, the other would succeed.<ref name=Huscroft118/> The last claimant was William of Normandy, and King Harold Godwinson made most of his preparations to repel William's anticipated invasion.<ref name=Ruling12/>

Harold's brother Tostig made probing attacks along the southern shore of England in May 1066, landing at the [[Isle of Wight]], using a fleet supplied by Baldwin of Flanders. Tostig appears to have received little local support, and further raids into [[Lincolnshire]] and near the [[River Humber]] met with no more success, so Tostig retreated to Scotland, where he remained for a while.<ref name=Ruling12/> Meanwhile, William had, according to the Norman writer William of Jumieges, sent an embassy to King Harold Godwinson reminding Harold of his oath to support William's claim. Whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear. Harold meanwhile assembled an army and a fleet to repel the expected invasion by William. These troops and ships were deployed along the [[English Channel]] for most of the summer.<ref name=Ruling12/>

===William's preparations===

William of Poitiers describes a council called by the duke, where the writer describes a great debate that took place between William's nobles and supporters over whether to risk the invasion, but although some sort of formal assembly probably was held, it is unlikely that any debate occurred, since Duke William had secured control over his nobles earlier. Most of the assembled nobles would have been anxious to secure the rewards of conquering England.<ref name=Bates79>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 79<U+2013>81</ref> William of Poitiers also relates that the duke obtained [[Pope Alexander II]]'s consent for the invasion, along with a papal banner. The chronicler also claimed that the duke secured the support of Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] and King [[Sweyn II of Denmark]], but as Henry was still a minor and Sweyn was more likely to support Harold who could then help Sweyn against the Norwegian king, these claims should be treated with caution. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion.{{efn|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] may possibly depict a papal banner carried by William's forces, but this is not named as such in the tapestry.<ref name=Huscroft120/>}}<ref name=Huscroft120>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 120<U+2013>123</ref> Events after the invasion, which included the penance William performed and statements by later popes, do lend circumstantial support to the claim of papal approval. William also put the government of Normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion.<ref name=DNB/>
 
Throughout the summer, William assembled an army and an invasion fleet in Normandy. Although William of Jumieges claim that the ducal fleet numbered 3,000 ships is clearly an exaggeration, the fleet was probably large and mostly built from scratch. Although William of Poitiers and William of Jumieges disagree about where the fleet was built&nbsp;<U+2013> Poitiers stating it was constructed at the mouth of the [[River Dives]] while Jumieges states it was built at [[Saint-Valery-sur-Somme]], both agree that the fleet eventually sailed from Valery-sur-Somme. The fleet carried an invasion force which included, in addition to troops from William's own territories of Normandy and Maine, large numbers of mercenaries, allies and volunteers from [[Brittany]], northeastern France and Flanders, together with smaller numbers from other parts of Europe. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the force in Normandy until late September. There were likely other reasons for William's delay, however, including intelligence reports from England which would have reported that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing.<ref name=Huscroft120/> Harold kept his forces on alert throughout the summer, but with the arrival of the harvest season, he disbanded his army on 8 September.<ref name=Carpenter72>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 72</ref>

===Tostig and Hardrada's invasion===
[[File:Battle Flat - geograph.org.uk - 285158.jpg|thumb|left|Modern day site of the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]|250px]]
Tostig and Hardrada invaded Northumbria in September 1066, and defeated the local forces under Morcar and Edwin at the [[Battle of Fulford]]. King Harold got word of their invasion and marched north and defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] on 25 September. Both Tostig and Hardrada were killed at Stamford.<ref name=Huscroft118>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 118<U+2013>119</ref> Meanwhile, on 27 September the Norman fleet finally set sail, landing in England at [[Pevensey Bay]] on 28 September. William then moved to [[Hastings]], a few miles to the east, where he built a castle as a base of operations. From there, he ravaged the interior and waited for Harold's return from the north, refusing to leave behind the sea, which was his line of communication with Normandy.<ref name=Carpenter72/>

===Battle of Hastings===
[[File:Harold dead bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|Death of [[Harold Godwinson]] in the Battle of Hastings, as shown on the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].]]
{{Main|Battle of Hastings}}

Harold, after defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, left much of his forces in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion.<ref name=Carpenter72/> It is unclear when Harold learned of William's landing, but likely it was while he was travelling south. Harold stopped in London, and was there for  about a week before Hastings, so he likely spent about a week on his march south, averaging about {{convert|27|mi|km|abbr=off}} per day,<ref name=Marren93>Marren ''1066'' p. 93</ref> for the approximately {{convert|200|mi|km|abbr=off}} distance.<ref name=Huscroft124>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 124</ref> Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William's scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy.<ref name=Lawson180>Lawson ''Battle of Hastings'' pp. 180<U+2013>182</ref> Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day [[Battle, East Sussex]]), about {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} from William's castle at Hastings.<ref name=Marren99>Marren ''1066'' pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref>

The battle began at about 9 am on 14 October and lasted all day, but while a broad outline is known, the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts in the sources.<ref name=Huscroft126>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 126</ref> Although the numbers on each side were about equal, William had both cavalry and infantry, including many archers, while Harold had only foot soldiers and few if any archers.<ref name=Carpenter73>Carpenter  ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 73</ref> The English soldiers formed up as a [[shield wall]] along the ridge, and were at first so effective that William's army was thrown back with heavy casualties. Some of William's Breton troops panicked and fled, and some of the English troops appear to have pursued the fleeing Bretons. However, Norman cavalry then attacked the pursuing troops and killed them. While the Bretons were fleeing, rumours swept the Norman forces that the duke had been killed, but William rallied his troops. Twice more the Normans feigned flight and drew  the English into pursuing them, allowing the Norman cavalry to attack them repeatedly.<ref name=Huscroft127>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 127<U+2013>128</ref> The available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon, but it appears that the decisive event was the death of Harold, about which differing stories are told. William of Jumieges claimed that Harold was killed by the duke. The Bayeux Tapestry has been claimed to show Harold's death by an arrow to the eye, but this may be a later reworking of the tapestry to conform to 12th century stories that Harold had died from an arrow wound to the head.<ref name=Huscroft129>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 129</ref>

The day after the battle, Harold's body was identified, whether through his armour or through marks on his body. The bodies of the English dead, which included some of Harold's brothers and his [[housecarl]]s, were left on the battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for custody of the body, but this offer was refused. Harold's body was ordered to be thrown into the sea by William, but whether this took place is unclear. [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]], which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had secretly been buried there.<ref name=Huscroft131>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' p. 131</ref>

===March on London===

After his victory, William may have hoped for the surrender of the English, but this did not happen. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the <U+00C6>theling as king, but Edgar's supporters were not solidly behind him. After waiting a bit, William then secured [[Dover]], parts of Kent, and [[Canterbury]], while also sending a force to capture [[Winchester]], where the royal treasury was.<ref name=Huscroft132/> These captures secured William's rear areas and also his line of retreat to Normandy, if that was needed.<ref name=DNB/> William then marched to [[Southwark]], across the [[Thames]] from London, which he reached in late November. William then led his forces around the south and west of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in early December. It was at Wallingford that Archbishop Stigand submitted to William, and when the duke moved on to [[Berkhamsted]] soon afterwards, Edgar, Morcar, Edwin and Archbishop Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle and was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] on Christmas Day 1066.<ref name=Huscroft132>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 131<U+2013>133</ref>

==Consolidation==
{{House of Normandy}}

===First actions===
William remained in England after his coronation, and tried to reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls&nbsp;<U+2013> Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and [[Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria|Waltheof]] (of Northampton) were confirmed in their lands and titles. Waltheof was married to William's niece and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was also proposed. Edgar the <U+00C6>theling also appears to have been given lands. Ecclesiastical offices also continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand.<ref name=Huscroft138/> Some who had fought against William at Hastings, however, lost their lands - including the lands of Harold and his brothers.<ref name=Carpenter75/> By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux in charge of England along with another influential supporter, [[William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford|William fitzOsbern]], the son of his former guardian.<ref name=Huscroft138/> Both men were named to earldoms also - fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent.<ref name=DNB/> Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English [[sheriff]]s.<ref name=Carpenter75>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 75<U+2013>76</ref> Once in Normandy, the king went to Rouen and the [[Abbey of Fecamp]],<ref name=Huscroft138>Huscroft ''Norman Conquest'' pp. 138<U+2013>139</ref> and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries.<ref name=DNB/>

While William was in Normandy, a former ally, [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]], the [[Count of Boulogne]], invaded at Dover but was repulsed. English resistance had also begun, with [[Eadric the Wild]] attacking Hereford and revolts at [[Exeter]], where Harold's mother Gytha was a focus of resistance.<ref name=Ruling57/> FitzOsbern and Odo had difficulties with controlling the native population and resorted to a programme of castle building to keep the kingdom under control.<ref name=DNB/> William returned to England in December 1067, and marched on Exeter, besieged it, and after 18 days, took the town and built a castle to secure control. Harold's sons, however, were raiding the southwest of England from a base in Ireland. These forces landed near Bristol, but were defeated by [[Eadnoth the Constable|Eadnoth]]. By Easter, William was at Winchester and he was joined shortly by his wife Matilda, who was crowned in May 1068.<ref name=Ruling57>Huscroft ''Ruling England'' pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref>

===English resistance===
[[File:Baile Hill, York.JPG|The remains of the second motte-and-bailey castle built by William in York|thumb|left|250px]]
In 1068 Edwin and Morcar revolted, supported by [[Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria|Gospatric]]. The chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] states that Edwin's reason for revolting was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of William's daughters had not taken place, but other reasons probably included the increasing power of William fitzOsbern in Herefordshire, which impacted Edwin's power within his own earldom. The king marched through Edwin's lands and built a castle at [[Warwick Castle|Warwick]]. This caused Edwin and Morcar to submit, but William continued on to [[York]], building castles at [[York Castle|York]] and [[Nottingham Castle|Nottingham]] before returning south. On his southbound journey, the king began construction of castles at [[Lincoln Castle|Lincoln]], [[Huntingdon Castle|Huntingdon]], and [[Cambridge Castle|Cambridge]]. William placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications&nbsp;<U+2013> among them [[William Peverel]] at Nottingham and [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick|Henry de Beaumont]] at Warwick. Then the king returned to Normandy late in 1068.<ref name=Ruling57/> 

Early in 1069, Edgar the <U+00C6>theling rose in revolt, and attacked York. Although William returned to York and built another castle, Edgar remained free and in the autumn joined up with King Sweyn of Denmark. The Danish king had brought a large fleet to England and attacked not only York, but Exeter and Shrewsbury. York was captured by the combined forces of Edgar and Sweyn. Edgar was proclaimed king by his supporters, but William responded swiftly, ignoring a continental revolt in Maine. William symbolically wore his crown in the ruins of York on Christmas Day 1069, and then proceeded to buy off the Danes. Further, he marched to the River Tees, ravaging the countryside as he went. Edgar, having lost much of his support, fled to Scotland,<ref name=Carpenter76/> where King [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Malcolm III]] was husband of Edgar's sister Margaret.<ref name=Douglas225>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 225</ref> Waltheof, who had joined the revolt, submitted, along with Gospatric, and both were allowed to retain their lands. William was not finished, however, and marched over the [[Pennines]] during the winter and defeated the remaining rebels at Shrewsbury before building castles at [[Chester Castle|Chester]] and [[Stafford Castle|Stafford]]. This campaign, which included the burning and destruction of part of the countryside that the royal forces marched through, is usually known as the "[[Harrying of the North]]", and was over by April 1070, when William wore his crown ceremonially for Easter at Winchester.<ref name=Carpenter76>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref>

===Church affairs===

While at Winchester in 1070, William met with three [[papal legate]]s&nbsp;<U+2013> John Minutus, Peter, and Ermenfrid of Sion, who had been sent by Pope Alexander. It was the legates who ceremonially crowned William during the Easter court.<ref name=Bates106/> The historian [[David Bates (historian)|David Bates]] sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal "seal of approval" for William's conquest.<ref name=DNB/> Then the legates and the king proceeded to hold a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and reorganizing the English church. Stigand and his brother, [[<U+00C6>thelm<U+00E6>r of Elmham|<U+00C6>thelm<U+00E6>r]], the [[Bishop of Elmham]] were deposed from their bishoprics. Some of the native abbots were also deposed, both at the council held near Easter and at a further one near [[Whitsun]]. The Whitsun council saw the appointment of Lanfranc as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Thomas of Bayeux]], as the new Archbishop of York, to replace Ealdred, who had died in September 1069. Norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbots, and at the end of the process, only two native English bishops remained in office, along with a number of continental prelates appointed by Edward the Confessor.<ref name=Bates106>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref> In 1070, William also founded [[Battle Abbey]], a new monastery at the site of the Battle of Hastings, partly as a penance for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to those dead.<ref name=DNB/>

==Troubles in England and the Continent==
===Danish raids and rebellion in the north===
Although Sweyn had promised to leave England, he returned in the spring of 1070, raiding along the Humber and East Anglia toward the [[Isle of Ely]], where he joined up with [[Hereward the Wake]], a local thegn. Hereward's forces attacked [[Peterborough Abbey]] and captured and looted it. But, William was able to secure the departure of Sweyn, who left England in 1070 with his fleet.<ref name=Douglas221>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 221<U+2013>222</ref> This enabled William to return to the continent to deal with troubles in Maine, where the town of [[Le Mans]] had revolted in 1069. Another concern was the death of Count [[Baldwin VI of Flanders]], who died in July 1070. This left Flanders in the grip of a succession crisis, with widow of Baldwin VI ruling for her two young sons, but her rule was contested by [[Robert I, Count of Flanders|Robert]], Baldwin's brother. The widow proposed marriage to William fitzOsbern, who was in Normandy, and fitzOsbern accepted but was killed in February 1071 at the [[Battle of Cassel (1071)|Battle of Cassel]] which resulted in Robert becoming count. Robert was opposed to King William's power on the continent, so the Battle of Cassel not only lost the king an important supporter, but also upset the continental balance of power in northern France.<ref name=Douglas223>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 223<U+2013>225</ref>

In 1071, William defeated the last rebellion of the north. Earl Edwin was betrayed by his own men and killed, while William built a causeway to subdue the Isle of Ely, where Hereward the Wake and Morcar were hiding. Hereward escaped, but Morcar was captured, deprived of his earldom and imprisoned. In 1072, William invaded Scotland, defeating Malcolm, who had recently invaded the north of England. William and Malcolm agreed to a peace by signing the Treaty of [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] and Malcolm probably gave up his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage for the peace. Another possible requirement for the peace was the expulsion of Edgar the <U+00C6>theling from Malcolm's court.<ref name=Bates107>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 107<U+2013>109</ref> William then turned his attentions to the continent, returning to Normandy in early 1073 to deal with the invasion of Maine by [[Fulk le Rechin]], the [[Count of Anjou]]. With a swift campaign, William seized Le Mans from Fulk's forces, and had finished his campaign by 30 March 1073. This made William's power more secure in northern France, but the new count of Flanders accepted Edgar the <U+00C6>theling into his court. Robert also married his half-sister [[Bertha of Holland|Bertha]] to the king of France, [[Philip I of France|Philip I]], who was opposed to Norman power.<ref name=Douglas228>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 228<U+2013>229</ref>

William returned to England to release his army from service in 1073, but was back in Normandy where he spent the entire year of 1074.<ref name=Bates111>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 111</ref> William left England in the hands of a number of his supporters, including [[Richard fitzGilbert]] and William de Warenne,<ref name=Bates112/> as well as Lanfranc.<ref name=Douglas231/> William's ability to leave England for an entire year was a sign that he was feeling that his control of the kingdom was secure.<ref name=Bates112>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 112</ref> While William was in Normandy, Edgar the <U+00C6>theling returned to Scotland from Flanders, and the French king, seeking a focus for persons opposed to William's power, proposed that the <U+00C6>theling be given the castle of [[Montreuil-sur-Mer]] on the English Channel, which would have given Edgar a strategic advantage against William. William managed to diffuse this threat by once more agreeing to allow Edgar at William's court,<ref name=Douglas230/> although the fact that Edgar was unable to take up the castle when the <U+00C6>theling's ships were wrecked contributed to Edgar's decision to submit to William.<ref name=Bates111/>{{efn|Edgar remained at William's court until 1086 when he went to the Norman principality in southern Italy.<ref name=Bates111/>}} Philip, although thwarted in this attempt, then turned his attentions to Brittany, and this led to a revolt in 1075.<ref name=Douglas230>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 230<U+2013>231</ref>

===Revolt of the Earls===
{{main|Revolt of the Earls}}
[[File:Castle Mound - Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 780624.jpg|thumb|right|The castle at Norwich. The [[keep]] dates to after the Revolt of the Earls, but the castle mound is earlier.<ref name=Castles161>Pettifer ''English Castles'' pp. 161<U+2013>162</ref>]]
In 1075, during William's absence, [[Ralph de Gael]], the [[Earl of Norfolk]] and [[Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Roger de Breteuil]], the [[Earl of Hereford]] conspired to overthrow William in the "Revolt of the Earls". Ralph was originally from Brittany and still held lands there. The exact reason for the rebellion is unclear, but it was launched at the wedding of Ralph to a relative of Roger's, held at [[Exning]]. Another earl, Waltheof, although one of William's favourites, was also involved, and there were a number of Breton lords who were ready to rebel in support of Ralph and Roger's efforts. Danish aid was also requested by Ralph. William remained in Normandy while his men in England subdued the revolt. Roger was unable to leave his stronghold in Herefordshire because of efforts by [[Wulfstan (died 1095)|Wulfstan]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] and [[<U+00C6>thelwig]], the [[Abbot of Evesham]]. Ralph was bottled up in [[Norwich Castle]] by the combined efforts of [[Odo of Bayeux]], [[Geoffrey de Montbray]], Richard fitzGilbert, and William de Warenne. Ralph eventually left Norwich in the hands of his wife and left England, finally ending up in Brittany. Norwich was besieged and surrendered, with the garrison allowed to go to Brittany. Meanwhile, the Danish king, Sweyn, had finally arrived in England with a fleet of 200 ships, but he was too late as Norwich had already surrendered. The Danes then raided along the coast before returning home.<ref name=Douglas231/> William only returned to England in autumn of 1075, to deal with the Danish threat, leaving his wife Matilda in charge of Normandy. William then celebrated Christmas at Winchester and dealt with the aftermath of the rebellion.<ref name=Bates181>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 181<U+2013>182</ref> Roger and Waltheof were kept in prison, with Waltheof being executed in May 1076. Before this, however, William had returned to the continent, where Ralph had continued the rebellion from Brittany.<ref name=Douglas231>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 231<U+2013>233</ref>

===Troubles at home and abroad===
Earl Ralph had secured control of the castle at [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]], and in September 1076 William advanced into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at Dol, forcing him to retreat back to Normandy. But, although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of [[Simon de Cr<U+00E9>py]], the [[Count of Amiens]] to a monastery. Before he became a monk, Simon handed his county of the [[Vexin]] over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the French king's lands, and Simon had been a supporter of William's.{{efn|Although Simon was a supporter of William's, the Vexin was actually under the overlordship of King Philip, which is why Philip secured control of the county when Simon became a monk.<ref name=Bates183/>}} William was able to make peace with Philip in 1077, and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.<ref name=Bates183>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 183<U+2013>184</ref>

In late 1077 or early 1078, trouble began between William and his eldest son, Robert. Although Orderic Vitalis describes it as starting with a quarrel between Robert and his two younger brothers, [[William II of England|William]] and [[Henry I of England|Henry]], including a story that the quarrel was started when William and Henry threw water at Robert, it is much more likely that Robert was feeling powerless. Orderic relates that Robert had previously demanded control of Maine and Normandy and been rebuffed. The trouble in 1077 or 1078 resulted in Robert leaving Normandy accompanied by a band of young men, many of them the sons of William's supporters. Included amongst them was [[Robert of Belleme]], [[William de Breteuil]], and Roger, the son of Richard fitzGilbert. This band of young men went to the castle at [[Remalard]], where they proceeded to raid into Normandy. The raiders were supported by many of William's continental enemies.<ref name=Bates185>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 185<U+2013>186</ref> William immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from Remalard, but King Philip gave them the castle at [[Gerberoi]], where they were joined by a number of new supporters. William then laid siege to Gerberoi in January 1079. After three weeks, the besieged forces [[sortie|sallied]] from the castle and managed to take the besiegers by surprise. William was unhorsed by Robert, and was only saved from death by an Englishman. William's forces were forced to lift the siege and the king returned to Rouen. By 12 April 1080, William and Robert had reached an accommodation, with William once more affirming that Robert would receive Normandy when William died.<ref name=Douglas238>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 238<U+2013>239</ref>

[[File:The Castle Keep - geograph.org.uk - 652853.jpg|upright|left|The stone keep at Newcastle, built on the site of the wooden castle built by Robert Curthose in 1080.<ref name=Castles191>Pettifer ''English Castles'' pp. 191<U+2013>192</ref>|thumb]]

Word of William's defeat at Gerberoi stirred up difficulties in northern England. In August and September 1079, King Malcolm of Scots raided south of the [[River Tweed]], devastating the land between the [[River Tees]] and the Tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month. The lack of Norman response appears to have caused the Northumbrians to grow restive, and in the spring of 1080 they rebelled against the rule of [[Walcher]], the [[Bishop of Durham]] and Earl of Northumbria. The bishop was killed on 14 May 1080, and William dispatched his half-brother Odo to deal with the rebellion.<ref name=Douglas240/> William departed Normandy in July 1080,<ref name=Bates188>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 188</ref> and in the fall William's son Robert was sent on a campaign against the Scots. Robert raided into Lothian and forced Malcolm to agree to terms, and built a fortification at [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]] while returning to England.<ref name=Douglas240>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 240<U+2013>241</ref> The king was at Gloucester for Christmas 1080 and at Winchester for [[Whitsun]] in 1081, ceremonially wearing his crown on both occasions. A papal embassy arrived in England during this period, asking that William do fealty for England to the papacy, a request that William rejected.<ref name=Bates188/> William also visited Wales during 1081, although the English and the Welsh sources differ on exactly what the visit was for. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that it was a military campaign, but Welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to [[St Davids]] in honour of [[Saint David]]. By the end of 1081, William was back on the continent, dealing with disturbances in Maine. Although he led an expedition into Maine, the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal legate.<ref name=Bates189>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 189</ref>

===Last years===
Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the historian David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William was on the continent, there was nothing for the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' to record.<ref name=Bates193>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 193</ref> In 1082 William ordered the arrest of Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This would have been considered tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, and was not something that William would have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More struck in 1083, when his eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his difficulties.<ref name=Douglas243>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 243<U+2013>244</ref>

Maine continued to be difficult, with a rebellion by [[Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine]], probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at [[Sainte-Suzanne, Mayenne|Sainte-Suzanne]] by William's forces for at least two years, but eventually made his peace with the king and was restored to favour. William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear - he was in Normandy at Easter 1084, but may have been in England before that, in order to collect the [[danegeld]] that was assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King [[Cnut IV of Denmark]]. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.<ref name=Bates196>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 196<U+2013>198</ref>

==William as king==
===Changes in England - castles, forests, and nobles===
[[File:Tower of London White Tower.jpg|thumb|right|The White Tower of London, begun by William.<ref name=Castles151>Pettifer ''English Castles'' p. 151</ref>]]
As part of his efforts to secure England, William ordered many [[castle]]s, [[keep]]s, and [[motte-and-bailey|mottes]] built - among them the [[Tower of London]]'s foundation (the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]]). These fortifications allowed Normans to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrisons to be protected while they occupied the countryside. The early castles were simple earth and timber constructions which later were replaced with stone structures.<ref name=Bates147>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 147<U+2013>148</ref> Alongside the castles went a process of military reorganization. At first, most of the newly settled Normans kept household [[knight]]s and did not settle their retainers with [[fief]]s of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, a process known as [[subinfeudation]]. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also towards garrisoning castles. This method of organizing the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the [[Hide (unit)|hide]].<ref name=Bates154>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 154<U+2013>155</ref>

By William's death, after weathering a series of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy had been replaced by Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although a number of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds.<ref name=Bates148>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 148<U+2013>149</ref> William granted lands to his continental followers in two differing methods. One method was to grant to the new landholder the holding or holdings of one or more specific Englishmen. At other times, William granted a compact grouping of lands, previously held by many different Englishmen, to one Norman follower. Often, this was to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.<ref name=Bates152>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 152<U+2013>153</ref>

The medieval chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] says that the king also seized and depopulated many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal [[New Forest]] region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians, however, have come to the conclusion that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest.<ref name=Young7>Young ''Royal Forests'' pp. 7<U+2013>8</ref> William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the [[forest law]] into areas of the country which regulated who could hunt and what could be hunted.<ref name=Bates118>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 118<U+2013>119</ref>

===Administration===
[[File:William the Conqueror 1066 1087.jpg|thumb|left|250px|English coin of William the Conqueror]]

After 1066, William did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], of which 6 impressions still survive, stressed his role as king but separately mentioned his role as Duke, and was made for him after he conquered England.{{efn|The seal shows a mounted knight and is the first extant example of an [[equestrian seal]].<ref name=Bates138/>}} When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed [[fealty]] to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made - further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of [[writ]]s which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.<ref name=Bates138>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 138<U+2013>141</ref>

William took over an English government that was more complex than the Norman system. England was divided into [[shire]]s or [[counties]], which were further divided into either [[hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]]s or [[wapentake]]s. Each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff, who roughly had the same status as a Norman [[viscount]]. A sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue.<ref name=Bates23/> To oversee his expanded domain, William was forced to travel even more than he had as duke. He crossed back and forth between the continent and England at least 19 times between 1067 and his death. Between the Battle of Hastings and 1072, William spent most of his time actually in England, but after 1072, he spent the majority of his time in Normandy.<ref name=Bates133>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 133<U+2013>134</ref>{{efn|Between 1066 and 1072, William spent only 15 months in Normandy, and the rest in England. However, after returning to Normandy in 1072, William spent around 130 months in Normandy as against about 40 months in England.<ref name=Bates133/>}} Government was still centered around William's [[royal household|household]], and when he was in one part of his realms, decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that utilized letters and other documents. William also appointed deputies that could make decisions while he was absent, especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy. Usually, this was a member of William's close family - usually his half-brother Odo or his wife Matilda. Sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues.<ref name=Bates136>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 136<U+2013>137</ref>

William continued the collection of danegeld, a land tax. This was an advantage for William, as it was the only universal tax collected by western European rulers during this time period. It was an annual tax based on the value of landholdings, and could be collected at differing rates. Most years saw the rate of 2 shillings per hide, but in crises, it could be increased to as much as 6 shillings per hide.<ref name=Bates151>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 151<U+2013>152</ref> Coinage between the various parts of his domains continued to be minted in different cycles and styles. English coins were generally of high silver content, with high artistic standards, and were required to be re-minted every three years. Norman coins, however, had a much lower silver content, were often of poor quality artistically, and were rarely re-minted. Also, in England no other coinage was allowed, while on the continent other coinage was considered [[legal tender]]. Nor is there evidence that many English [[pennies]] were circulating in Normandy, which shows little attempt to integrate the monetary systems between England and Normandy.<ref name=Bates138/>

Besides taxation, William's rule was strengthened by his large landholdings throughout England. As King Edward's heir, he controlled all of the former royal lands. He also retained control of much of the lands of Harold and his family, which made the king the largest secular landowner in England by a large margin.{{efn|In ''[[Domesday Book]]'', the king's lands were worth four times as much as the lands of his half-brother Odo, the next largest landowner, and seven times as much as [[Roger of Montgomery]], the third largest landowner.<ref name=Bates150>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' p. 150</ref>}}

===Domesday Book===
{{main|Domesday Book}}
[[File:Domesday Book - Warwickshire.png|upright|right|thumb|250px|A page from ''Domesday Book'' for Warwickshire.]]
At Christmas 1085, William ordered the compilation of a survey of the landholdings of himself and his vassals throughout the kingdom, organized by counties, a work now known as the Domesday Book. Each county's listing gave the holdings of each landholder - grouped by owners. The listings describe the holding, who owned the land before the Conquest, the value of the land, what the tax assement was, and usually lists the number of peasants, ploughs, and any other resources the holding had. Towns were listed separately. All the English counties south of the River Tees and [[River Ribble]] are included. The whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 August 1086, when the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' records that he received the results and that all the chief magnates swore the [[Oath of Salisbury|Salisbury Oath]], a renewal of their oaths of allegiance.<ref name=Bates198>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 198<U+2013>202</ref> William's exact purpose in ordering the compilation of ''Domesday Book'' are unclear - likely it had several purposes including allowing increased taxation as well as record of feudal obligations.<ref name=DNB/>

==Death and aftermath==
[[File:StEtienne Tombo GuillaumeLeC.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Slab marking the gravesite of William]]
William left England in the fall of 1086, and after his arrival on the continent he married his daughter [[Constance]] to [[Alan Fergant]], the [[Count of Brittany]]. This was a furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French King Philip I, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] or his saddle.<ref name=Bates202/> He was taken to Rouen and the priory of St Gervase near the city, where he died on 9 September 1087.<ref name=DNB/>  Knowledge of what happened before his death is confused by the fact that there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but his account is likely more of an account of how a king should die than an account of what actually happened. The other account, the ''[[De Obitu Willelmi]]'', or ''On the Death of William'', has been shown to be a copy of two 9th century accounts with names changed.<ref name=Bates202>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 202<U+2013>205</ref>

William left Normandy to Robert, and the custody of England was given to William, the second surviving son, with the assumption being that he would become king. The youngest son, Henry, received money. After entrusting England to his second son, the elder William sent the younger William back to England on 7 or 8 September, along with a letter to Lanfranc that ordered the archbishop to aid the new king. Other bequests included gifts to the church, money to be distributed to the poor. He also ordered that all of his prisoners be released, including his half-brother Odo.<ref name=Bates202/>

Disorder followed William's death, with all of people who had been at his deathbed leaving the body at Rouen and hurrying off on their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired to be buried in his foundation of [[Abbaye-aux-Hommes|St Etienne]]. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations, the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb and the tomb burst and spread a disgusting odor throughout the church.<ref name=Bates207>Bates ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 207<U+2013>208</ref>  

William's grave is currently marked by a marble slab with a [[Latin]] inscription dating from the early 19th century. The tomb has been disturbed a number of times since 1087, the first time in 1522 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy. The body was restored to the tomb intact at that time, but in 1562 during the [[French Wars of Religion]] the grave was opened and the bones were scattered and lost with the exception of one thigh bone. This lone relic was reburied in 1642 with a new marker, which was replaced a 100 years later with a more elaborate monument. This tomb was again destroyed during the [[French Revolution]], but was eventually replaced with the current marker.<ref name=Douglas362>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' pp. 362<U+2013>363</ref>{{efn|The thigh bone currently in the tomb is assumed to be the one that was reburied in 1642, but the Victorian historian [[E. A. Freeman]] was of the opinion that the bone had been lost in 1793.<ref name=Douglas363>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 363 footnote 4</ref>}}

William married Matilda of Flanders and had at least nine children.<ref name=Douglas393/> The birth order of the boys is clear, but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters.<ref name=DNB/>
