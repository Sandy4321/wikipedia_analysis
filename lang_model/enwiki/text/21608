The 128th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 27 March 1982. Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Oxford won by three-and-a-quarter lengths, securing their seventh consecutive victory.  Their number five, [[Boris Rankov]], won a record fifth Boat Race as a rower, and Oxford's Clay brothers became the first twins to win the event.

In the [[Reserve team|reserve race]], Oxford's Isis beat Cambridge's [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] by one-and-a-quarter lengths, and in the [[Women's Boat Race]], Cambridge were victorious.

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 8 April 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  First held in 1829, the race takes place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 3 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=CBC News|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/tv-and-radio | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 5 July 2014}}</ref>  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having beaten Cambridge by eight lengths in the [[The Boat Race 1981|previous year's race]].  However Cambridge held the overall lead, with 68 victories to Oxford's 58.<ref name=dodd348>Dodd, p. 348</ref> 

The first [[Women's Boat Race]] took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history | title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 5 July 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.  It usually takes place on the Tideway, prior to the main Boat Race.<ref name=results/>

During the pre-race preparations, the Cambridge crew struck a floating [[Railroad tie|railway sleeper]] near [[Chiswick Eyot]], damaging their boat which needed repair before the race.<ref name=don/>  Oxford's crew suffered illness in the days leading up the race, in particular the president Nick Conington who was moved from stroke to bow to reduce the chances of a possible recurrence of glandular fever.<ref name=signs>{{Cite news | title = Signs of a tide turn | first = Christopher | last = Dodd | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 27 March 1982 | page = 24}}</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of just below 14&nbsp;[[stone (unit)|st]] (88.7&nbsp;kg) per rower, and had a {{convert|10|lb|kg}} per man advantage over Cambridge.<ref name=dodd349/>  Oxford saw four former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] return, including the first female cox in [[Sue Brown (rowing)|Sue Brown]].  Cambridge's crew contained a single Blue in boat club president Roger Stephens.<ref name=dodd349/><ref name=pride/> Despite retiring from rowing, [[Boris Rankov]], a junior fellow at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford|St Hugh's]] was persuaded back into the crew by the Oxford boat club president Nick Conington.<ref name=don/>  Rankov was rowing in his fifth consecutive Boat Race, alongside Steve Foster whom he [[Supervisor#Academia|supervised]] in [[classics]].<ref name=don>{{Cite news | title = The Oxford don expects to record another first | first = Christopher | last = Dodd | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 26 March 1982 | page= 24}}</ref> Oxford's crew also contained the Clay twins, Robert and Hugh.<ref name=signs/>

River conditions were calm: Jim Railton of ''[[The Times]]'' described the course as "a smooth and flat Queen's highway from Putney to Mortlake."<ref name=neck/>  Michael Muir-Smith was the umpire for the race,<ref name=pride/> for which Oxford were "heavily favoured".<ref name=pride>{{Cite news | title = Oxford's pride to overcome Light Blues' passion | first = Jim | last = Railton | work = [[The Times]] | date = 27 March 1982 | issue = 61193 | page = 17}}</ref>   They won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.<ref name=hard/> A good start from the Light Blues saw them a length ahead by [[Craven Cottage]] and passing the Mile Post one second ahead of Oxford.  From [[Harrods Furniture Depository]], Oxford fought their way back into contention with cox Brown forcing her counterpart Bernstein to steer towards the centre of the river.  Both crews shot [[Hammersmith Bridge]] a second apart, with Oxford quickly gaining a length's lead and a clear water advantage.  Cambridge were nine seconds down by Chiswick Steps and a further second behind at [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]].  Oxford passed the finishing post eleven seconds and three-and-a-quarter lengths ahead of Cambridge, in a time of 18 minutes 21 seconds, to record their seventh consecutive victory.<ref name=hard/>    

In the reserve race, Isis beat Goldie by one-and-a-quarter lengths and five seconds in a time of 18 minutes 43 seconds to record their third consecutive victory.<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/results | title =Men &ndash; Results | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 21 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=neck>{{Cite news | title = The neck-snapper who lurks under the bridge| first = Jim | last = Railton | date = 29 March 1982 | page = 14 |issue = 61194| work = [[The Times]]}}</ref>  In the 37th running of the [[Henley Boat Races#Women's Boat Race|Women's Boat Race]], Cambridge triumphed, their first win in three years.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/results | title =Women &ndash; Results | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate =21 July 2014}}</ref>

==Reaction==
Rankov, who became the first rower to win five consecutive Boat Races (C. R. W. Tottenham had won five as a cox in the 1860s),<ref name=pride/> admitted, "The beginning was all right.  We expected them to be up on us before Hammersmith.  But the burn we did there was exhausting. It was really hard just to keep in front for the rest of the way."<ref name=hard>{{Cite news | title = Rankov hard-pressed to score fifth triumph | first = Christopher | last = Dodd| work = [[The Guardian]] | page = 19 | date = 29 March 1982}}</ref> Defeated Cambridge cox Bernstein said, "I can't wait to get back at them next year", while his number six Simon Harris stated, "we will have six of this crew left next year.  That's a good base".<ref name=hard/> The Clays became the first twins to win a Boat Race.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.itvtheboatrace.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140415053605/http://www.itvtheboatrace.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History | publisher = [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] | title = History of the Boat Race | archivedate= 15 April 2014 |accessdate= 8 August 2014 }}</ref>
