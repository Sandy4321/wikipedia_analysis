'''Abu Thabit''' served briefly as governor of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] for the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 900. 

Governor [[Ibn al-Ikhshad]] left him behind in the city as his deputy and successor, when the former went in a raid against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in late 899/early 900. Ibn al-Ikhshad was killed during the raid, and Abu Thabit succeeded him.{{sfn|Rosenthal|1985|p=83}}{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Ab<U+016B> <U+1E6E><U+0101>bit (#20080)}} He soon had to face a Byzantine counter-raid, which in March 900 reached the gates of Tarsus. Abu Thabit pursued the Byzantines to the river Rayhan (unidentified), but there was defeated and captured. According to [[al-Tabari]], along with other Muslim prisoners he was taken prisoner to [[Iconium]] and thence to [[Constantinople]].{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Ab<U+016B> <U+1E6E><U+0101>bit (#20080)}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|1985|pp=83<U+2013>84}} 

Back in Tarsus, his son tried to take over his post, claiming that his father had appointed him as his successor, but this was opposed by the elders of Tarsus and the surrounding towns of the ''[[thughur]]'', who chose [[Ali ibn al-Arabi]]. Abu Thabit's son armed followers to impose himself by force, but in the end was persuaded to accept Ibn al-Arabi.{{sfn|PmbZ|loc=Ab<U+016B> <U+1E6E><U+0101>bit (#20080)}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|1985|pp=83<U+2013>84}}
