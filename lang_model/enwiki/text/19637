It began in December 2011 and was One Direction's first solo tour after being formed in the [[The X Factor (UK series 7)|seventh series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' and being signed to [[Syco Records]]. The concert tour was announced in September 2011 with the initial British and Irish dates being revealed. The concert tour managed by Modest! Management, the shows backed by a four-piece musical band, with the creative assessments being handled by Caroline Watson and Lou Teasdale, among others. After the initial concert tour concluded in January 2012, shortly afterwards, due international demand, the concert tour expanded with legs in Australasia and North America. Ultimately they played over 60 shows in [[Europe]], [[Australasia]] and [[North America]]. 

The [[set list]] included songs from One Direction's debut album and five covers. Commentators commended One Direction's singing abilities, production of the show, and One Direction's natural stage presence. The Up All Night Tour was a commercial success, with sold-out shows and demand for tickets prompting organizers to add more dates to the itinerary.

During a break from concerts, One Direction promoted their album in the [[United States]]. Following an appearance on the ''[[Today (NBC Program)|Today Show]]'', ''Up All Night'' was released in the U.S. and debuted at number one, and One Direction became the first ever UK group to have debut number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2012/03/21/one-direction-up-all-night-number-one-album/ |title=Album sales: One Direction makes history with No. 1 debut of 'Up All Night' |author=Smith, Grady |date=21 March 2012 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]] |accessdate=8 April 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1333937077ORIFCKCCCW |archivedate=8 April 2012}}</ref> This led to the group extending the tour into North America.

===Critical response===
The concerts in England and Ireland received mixed feedback from critics. [[Kitty Empire]] (''[[The Observer]]'') was not impressed with the show at Windsor Hall. She writes, "It's easy to sneer at boy bands, but always worth considering their appeal. It goes without saying that One Direction are slick, and often bland. With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/jan/08/one-direction-x-factor-live |title=One Direction <U+2013> review |author=Empire, Kitty|date=7 January 2012 |work=[[The Observer]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=8 April 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1333939139CSPGVONNPC |archivedate=8 April 2012}}</ref> For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (''[[Daily Mirror]]'') gave the band a positive review. He states, "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams. Each took a turn walking forward to embrace the cries from the sold-out Hammersmith Apollo while singing the lame-named Na, Na, Na. It was impossible to tell which one of the five boys had the biggest ovation but the loudest cheer came when Niall played acoustic guitar as they sang solo around an artificial camp fire".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/one-direction-live-review-from-hammersmith-171874 |title=One Direction's Hammersmith Apollo gig |author=James Robertson |date=11 January 2012 |work=[[Daily Mirror]] |publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]] |accessdate=8 April 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1333939607CZJAMCVUXO |archivedate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Another glowing review was done by Alexandra Ryan (''[[Evening Herald]]'') for the concert at Dublin's The O<sub>2</sub>. She says, "THEY came, they saw, they conquered. Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2. Swarms of screaming girls flocked to the sold-out venue last night as Zayn, Harry, Louis, Liam and Mullingar teen Niall Horan performed for 14,000 fans".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.herald.ie/news/one-direction-show-has-fans-up-all-night-2999092.html |title=One Direction show has fans up all night |author=Ryan, Alexandra |date=25 January 2012 |work=[[Evening Herald]] |publisher=[[Independent News & Media]] |accessdate=8 April 2012|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1333939933IFYQZGQCXW |archivedate=8 April 2012}}</ref>

As the tour progressed to Australasia and North America, many commentators remarked on the band's popularity and their singing abilities. For the concert at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion, Mike Wass ([[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]) felt One Direction's "surprisingly accomplished effort" of [[King of Leon]]'s "Use Somebody" proved that One Direction is "more than" capable of evolving its sound in the future.<ref>{{cite news|author=Wass, Mike |url=http://idolator.com/6351471/one-direction-live-in-sydney-concert-review |title=One Direction Live In Sydney: Concert Review |work=''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]''|publisher=[[Buzz Media]]|date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> Cameron Adams (''[[Herald Sun]]'') wrote a positive review for the concert in Melbourne at the Hisense Arena. He felt One Direction represented "A cleverly cast pop band with plenty of personality unleashed at the perfect time and seizing their moment." He felt the covers performed showcased "strong pop voices." Concluding his review Adams wrote, "Who knows if they'll progress beyond the usual boy band lifespan. But for now they're making a lot of people very happy."<ref>{{cite news|author=Adams, Cameron |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/one-direction-infection-sweeps-melbourne/story-e6frf96f-1226329537630|title=One Direction infection sweeps Melbourne |work= [[Herald Sun]]|publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times]] |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Lars Brandle (''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'') reviewed the concert at the BBEC Great Hall in Brisbane, Brandle heavily noted the band's popularity writing "To say [1D] is the hottest boy-band on the scene, doesn't quite grasp the situation. "On fire" is closer to the mark." Brandle lauded the show for being "all slick [and] clean fun".<ref>{{cite news|author=Brandle, Lars|title=One Direction Live: Shriek Show in Australia|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100#/news/one-direction-live-shriek-show-in-australia-1006822752.story|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>

Reviewing the concert in Fairfax at the Patriot Center, Chris Richards (''[[The Washington Post]]'') elaborated on the concept of the show. He wrote "Over the course of umpteen songs, its members didn't work the stage so much as loiter on it. They looked comfortable. No silly choreography, just a few ensemble fist-pumps. No ridiculous costumes, just letterman jackets, cardigans and khakis. A no-nonsense backing band <U+2014> guitar, bass, keyboards and drums <U+2014> provided steady renditions of nearly all of the songs on the group<U+2019>s debut album, "Up All Night," as well as a few covers, including Kings of Leon's "Use Somebody" and Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn."<ref>{{cite news| author=Richards, Chris| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/one-direction-show-polite-boy-band-excites-squealing-fans/2012/05/25/gJQAmYxVpU_story.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] | title=One Direction whips Patriot Center into a G-rated frenzy | date=25 May 2012|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref> Erica Futterman (''[[Rolling Stone]]'') , wrote for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York, "U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal." Futterman added points of highlight to One Direction's acoustic performances, which "showed off Horan's ability to play [[guitar]], as well as One Direction's admirable live vocals. There was no need to worry about a backing track or a bum note, a pleasant realization at a pop show."<ref>{{cite news|author=Futterman, Erica |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/one-direction-make-a-play-for-longevity-on-first-american-headlining-tour-20120527 |title=One Direction Make a Play For Longevity on First American Headlining Tour |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]] |date=27 May 2012 |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref> Jane Stevenson ([[Canoe.ca]]) highlighted the show at the Molson Canadian Amphitheatre in Toronto for "none of that choreographed dance move nonsense."

Lau noted One Direction's lack of original material to perform "[the group] falls back on a handful of covers to fill in their set, including Kings of Leon's "Use Somebody", Gym Class Heroes' "Stereo Hearts" and, surprisingly, Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn". Not straying too far away from the originals, the mid-show medley definitely felt like the boys randomly belting out songs for the sake of filler but girls didn't mind."<ref>{{cite news|author= Lau, Melody |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/06/01/concert-review-one-direction-are-mostly-killer-with-some-filler/ |title= Concert Review: One Direction are mostly killer with some filler|work=[[National Post]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]] Inc.|date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=11 June 2012}}</ref>
