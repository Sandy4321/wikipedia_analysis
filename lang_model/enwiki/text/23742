Every Lady club has stats that have to be increased by the Club members so they could have a better chance for in-game bonuses and winning club fights. Club fights are team duels organized by the president of the Lady club. The Club president can choose an opponent Lady club and set a date and time for the club fight. All the Club members can join the club fight, thus have a better chance to win the fight and steal a trophy (if any) from the opponent Lady club for extra bonuses. <ref name="Poged">[http://us.poged.com/news/New-Lady-Club-option-in-the-game-Lady-Popular/ Poged, New Lady Club option in the game Lady Popular], language: English</ref>
