'''Children of a Lesser Clod''' is the 20th episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelfth season]]. In the episode, after spraining his knee during a basketball game, Homer begins taking care of the neighborhood kids to cure his boredom, prompting jealousy from Bart and Lisa, who feel that Homer is giving the kids the attention they never had.

The episode is written by former and current [[show runner]], [[Al Jean]] and directed by [[Michael Polcino]]. The title is a parody of the play/movie ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]''.

==Plot==
The family goes to the [[YMCA]] to attend one-time-only free classes, along with many other Springfieldians who admit they will never return to the YMCA and pay for any of the regular classes. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] takes [[gymnastics]] (and gets yelled at by the Russian coach for being too old), [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] gets tricked into taking an [[etiquette]] class by a black man dressed as a gangsta rapper (who happens to be the husband of the prim and proper etiquette teacher), and [[Homer]] participates in a [[basketball]] class for men over the age of 35, but suffers a torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] after a dunk attempt ends with the backboard crashing down on his leg. After Homer gets his surgery, he is told by [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]] that he cannot go to work, and he must stay home. Homer finds himself extremely bored, even going so far as attempting to cross-breed [[Santa's Little Helper]] and [[Snowball II]]. One evening, [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] wants Marge to watch Rod and Todd while he attends a [[Chris Rock]] concert (that he misinterprets to be an abbreviation for a Christian Rock concert), but Marge is out identifying a body (which ends up being a very much alive [[Hans Moleman]] which everyone thinks is really dead) so Ned asks Homer instead. The kids like having Homer take care of them, which allows Homer to establish his own day care center.

Homer starts a day care center (under Marge's ownership), "Uncle Homer's Day Care Center", to entertain himself, but makes Bart and Lisa feel like outcasts by ignoring them, giving Bart's jacket to Milhouse, forcing them out of their bedrooms for a film crew that is making a documentary about him, and having them work long hours at night to cut out felt hearts in his honor. The daycare center is wildly successful, and Homer earns a nomination for the "Good Guy Awards" ceremony. For the ceremony, Bart and Lisa splice in home movie footage of Homer at his worst (passed out on the floor drunk and almost naked  during Christmas, losing Maggie in a poker game, and chasing Bart down the street while wielding a chain mace) to prove to everyone that Homer's nice guy persona is a sham. The audience becomes outraged and Homer angrily strangles Bart on stage. Everyone in the audience becomes horrified by Homer's behavior, and decide to prevent their kids from being watched over by him. Homer escapes from the ceremony with all the kids on a van, until he crashes the van into a tree, and tries to escape before Chief Wiggum stops him. After three mistrials, Homer apologizes to Bart and Lisa for neglecting them, and promises to care for his own children (including the perpetually-ignored Maggie) instead of the neighborhood kids.

This episode marks the first appearance of [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Coach Lugash|Lugash]] the [[B<U+00E9>la K<U+00E1>rolyi]]-esque gymnastics coach. He would later appear in "[[Little Girl in the Big Ten]]". This is the first episode where it is revealed that [[Kent Brockman]] and [[List of media personalities in The Simpsons#Arnie Pie|Arnie Pie]] (the helicopter news reporter) do not get along at work. In previous episodes, the two characters did not audibly hate each other (in fact, they were shown bowling together on the season seven episode "[[Team Homer]]" as part of the Channel 6 Wastelanders bowling team along with [[Krusty the Clown]] and The Mexican [[List of media personalities in The Simpsons#Bumblebee Man|Bumblebee Man]]), but there were many times where Kent Brockman would brush off any misfortune that Arnie Pie happened upon (cf. [[Mr. Plow]]). In later episodes, Kent and Arnie would either argue or express hatred for each other (cf. the season thirteen finale "[[Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge]]", the season fourteen episode "[[Pray Anything]]", the season fifteen episode "[[The Wandering Juvie]]", and the season 18 finale "[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]]").<ref name="Pie">{{cite video | people=Gammill, Tom|date=2009|title=The Simpsons The Complete Twelfth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Children of a Lesser Clod"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

This episode was advertised as featuring [[Ron Howard]] in what would have been his third appearance on "The Simpsons" (his first two appearances can be found in season ten's "[[When You Dish Upon a Star]]" and season eleven's "[[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]"). Originally, the third act involved Homer getting all the kids in Howard's latest film, a ''[[Gladiator]]''-like picture, hence the original title of the episode being "The Kids Stay In The Picture" (a play on the title of legendary producer [[Robert Evans (producer)|Robert Evans]]' "[[The Kid Stays in the Picture]]"). However, Ron Howard did not appear in this episode (in fact, no guest voices were used at all in this episode) and the third act was about Homer winning an award for caring for the neighborhood kids until his own children show him as an unfit father.

The original airing of the episode had a peculiar animation error in it. At the end of the schoolyard scene with Bart, Milhouse and Ralph (after Milhouse tells Bart that Bart's jacket looks better on him), the last few frames of animation show animatic layout drawings of Bart instead of cleaned and colored cels.<ref>[http://www.simpsonsfolder.com/special/index.html The Simpsons Folder - Special<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In all reruns, this error is fixed.

The title is a spoof of the play ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' and the [[1986]] [[Children of a Lesser God|film]] based upon it. The episode features the original basket for basketball.<ref name="Do the Bartman"/> Professor Frink's use of "[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]" directly references the [[1997 in film|1997 film]] of the same name. Lugash is a parody of [[B<U+00E9>la K<U+00E1>rolyi]].<ref name="Do the Bartman"/>
Homer's line "I believe you can fly!" references the R. Kelly song "[[I Believe I Can Fly]]" from the [[1996 in film|1996 film]] ''[[Space Jam]]''. As Homer recalls doing a slam dunk into space (which never happened), [[George Jetson]] crashes into his leg. Homer reacts as if he was his boss, Mr Spacely.
Rainier Wolfcastle's plan to convert the YMCA so he can hunt "the most dangerous prey of all: man" is a reference to ''[[The Most Dangerous Game]]''.The "crazy" [[torch song]] that Homer sings while babysitting Rod and Todd Flanders is a [[1969]] hit song by [[Peggy Lee]] called "[[Is That All There Is?]]", which was Lee's final [[Top 40]] hit and a #1 song on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|easy listening chart]]. When Homer goes hysterical and kidnaps the children, [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]] asks where they're going. Homer replies they're getting frosty chocolate milkshakes. When the series was on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', this was Homer's catchphrase. It was also something of a running joke in the first two seasons (and was mentioned again in [[Treehouse of Horror XIII|THoH XIII's Send in the Clones]], in which one of Homer's clones is his Tracy Ullman Show persona).  The Good Guys Award is criticized by the ''[[New York Times]]'' as "Pointless."

==Internet meme==
A short segment of the episode features [[Bill Cosby]] asking a child on his show ''[[Kids Say the Darndest Things]]'' about a specific hobby, of which the child promptly replies "[[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]!" Cosby begins incoherently rambling about what Pok<U+00E9>mon is whilst flapping his ears. This is a parodied mannerism of Cosby's that is often used on the show.<ref>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/CABF16]</ref> This is also the second time Cosby has been parodied on ''The Simpsons''. Another similar gag was used in the episode [[Helter Shelter]].

This sequence involving Bill Cosby's over-exaggerated mannerisms from this and other episodes on ''The Simpsons'' (as well as the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Brian Does Hollywood]]") became an [[internet meme]] when many parodies on these particular segments became internet memes in their own right, especially on [[YouTube]] and [[YTMND]].<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/29/AR2006072900041_pf.html A Home For Quick Hits]</ref>

==Reception==
Colin of Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave this episode a mixed review, saying "When Bart and Lisa team up to pursue a goal, the result usually succeeds. And that<U+2019>s true for <U+201C>Clod<U+201D> <U+2013> at least to a moderate degree. Like most Season 12 episodes, the program doesn<U+2019>t become truly delightful, but it does more right than wrong, so it ends up as a decent success."<ref>http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasontwelve.shtml</ref>
