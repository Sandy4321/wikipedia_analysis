==The documents==
{{ref improve section|date=January 2011}}

===Jerusalem===
According to one of the documents, the Palestinian Authority was prepared to concede all [[Israeli settlements]] in and around [[East Jerusalem]], as well as the [[Armenian Quarter]], with the exception of [[Har Homa]]. The [[Temple Mount]] would be temporarily administrated by a joint body consisting of the Palestinian Authority, Israel, [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United States]] until a permanent solution was reached.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/israel-rejected-historic-concessions-palestine-papers-reveal/article1880189/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

===Borders===
At a meeting in Jerusalem in November 2007, according to the documents, [[Tzipi Livni]] became visibly angry when asked about the demographic composition of the future Israeli state.  She was quoted as saying "Israel the state of the Jewish people -- and I would like to emphasize the meaning of <U+201C>its people<U+201D> is the Jewish people<U+2014>with Jerusalem the united and undivided capital of Israel and of the Jewish people for 3007 years".  The Palestinians team then protested her position on Jerusalem.  She responded by saying "Now I have to say, before we continue, in order to continue we have to put out Jerusalem from your statement and from our place. We have enough differences, without putting another one out there".  Making the discussion of the borders of Jerusalem a non-starter on the subject of borders.

Later in the discussion, Tzipi Livni told [[Ahmed Qurei]] that "I understand the sentiments of the Palestinians when they see the settlements being built. The meaning from the Palestinian perspective is that Israel takes more land, that the Palestinian state will be impossible, the Israel policy is to take more and more land day after day and that at the end of the day we'll say that it is impossible, we already have the land and cannot create the state".  She indicated that the position was not the policy of her current coalition but of other parties.  The Palestinian negotiators protested the idea that the settlement activity had been halted as well as pointed out that the issue of settlements also included settlement expansion and activity from the private sector.  Tzipi Livini responded to that by stating "When the government has [issued] the tender in the past it means that the private sector won the tender and then it has the rights on the land. They are entitled to work on the land that they purchased".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/feb/12/corrections-clarifications?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Corrections and clarifications | date=12 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Palestine Papers: Meeting Minutes: 8th Negotiation Team Meeting|url=http://www.ajtransparency.com/en/projects/thepalestinepapers/20121823740234656.html|work=Al Jazeera Transparency Unit|publisher=Al Jazeera Media Network|accessdate=19 June 2012|date=13|month=November|year=2007}}</ref> 

According to the documents, in a meeting with Livni in Jerusalem, Qurei proposed that Israel annex all settlements along the border except for the large cities and towns of [[Giv'at Ze'ev]], [[Ma'ale Adumim]], [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], and [[Efrat]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/africa-mideast/israel-rejected-historic-concessions-palestine-papers-reveal/article1880189/page2/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> The documents indicate Livni rejected Qurei's demands that Israel cede these settlements. Qurei reportedly suggested to Livni that these settlements be placed under Palestinian sovereignty, but Livni told him "you know this is not realistic". According to the documents, [[Condoleezza Rice]] similarly told Qurei that "I don't think that any Israeli leader is going to cede Ma'ale Adumim", to which Qurei replied "or any Palestinian". Rice then told him "Then you won't have a state!"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Palestine Papers: "The biggest Yerushalayim"|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011122112512844113.html|work=Al Jazeera online|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=19 June 2012|author=Gregg Carlstrom|language=English|date=23|month=January|year=2011}}</ref>

===Napkin Map peace process of 2008===
{{copyedit|section|date=May 2012}}
According to the Palestine Papers, Israeli Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] and Mahmoud Abbas held a series of peace proposal meetings during the middle of 2008 to September 16, 2008 in which the infamous "Napkin Map" incident occurred. During the first of these meeting, according to the records of the Palestine Papers, the Palestinian Authority proposed an unprecedented land swap, offering Israel the opportunity to annex all of the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem. Israel, however, offered nothing in return in concessions at that meeting.<ref name="english.aljazeera.net">http://english.aljazeera.net/palestinepapers/2011/01/2011122114239940577.html</ref>

During the next attempts to finalize borders, Ehud Olmert offered his own map in which Israel would annex more than 10% of the West Bank. The land in Ehud Olmert's map included the four settlements of [[Gush Etzion]] (with [[Efrat]]), [[Ma'ale Adumim]], [[Giv'at Ze'ev]], and [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]], in addition to all settlements in East Jerusalem ([[Har Homa]]). In exchange for those lands, Ehud Olmert's proposed map offered 5.5% of Israeli land as part of the swap. The land offered consisted of lightly populated farmland, which would be divided between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. When Mahmoud Abbas asked to keep a copy of the map for further consideration, Ehud Olmert refused to comply. Mahmoud Abbas was forced to sketch Ehud Olmert's map by hand on a napkin to have a copy for further consideration. This map was then later referred to as the Napkin Map.

The third and final meeting occurred on September 16, 2008. It was during at the tail end of Ehud Olmert's political career. At the time, Olmert was under police investigation for alleged corruption that had occurred while he was Mayor of Jerusalem, and Olmert was not planning on running again. During that meeting, Mahmoud Abbas was prepared by the Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) to clarify many questions regarding Ehud Olmert's peace plan. In which Abbas was quoted as asking questions such as "How do you see it addressing our interests, especially as Ariel, Maale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Har Homa and Efrat clearly prejudice contiguity, water aquifers, and the viability of Palestine?" as well as others about the value of the land that they would receive in such a swap in terms of value and size.<ref name="english.aljazeera.net"/>

The Negotiation Support Unit (NSU) also insisted on Ehud Olmert to provide them with a copy of the map which was again denied. In the end, however, Mahmoud Abbas asked for a few days to consider the offer. A day after this meeting Ehud Olmert was resigned, Tzipi Livni stepped in as Acting Prime Minister, and [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was elected shortly afterward. Netanyahu refused to start negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas and a revised map he had created as well as refused to restart negotiations based on the more demanding and aggressive map created by Ehud Olmert.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/01/30/goodspeed-analysis-a-palestine-that-might-have-been/ |title=Goodspeed Analysis: A Palestine that might have been |last=Goodspeed |first=Peter |date=30 January 2011 |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 }}</ref>

===Refugees===
Yankie Galenty, a media adviser for [[Ehud Olmert]], affirmed the complete authenticity of the documents in an interview. In regards to refugees, he stated that "Olmert, from day one, did not deceive Abu Mazen and told him that Israel will not allow the return of refugees and not one refugee will return to the land of Israel."<ref>[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/4739/World/Region/Olmert-adviser-says-AlJazeera-leaks--correct.aspx Olmert adviser says Al-Jazeera leaks 100% correct], Ahram Online, 24 January 2011</ref>

Other officials in the Israeli government asked for a limited right of return numbering between five to ten thousand, out of a total of five million refugees, who would be carefully picked by Israel and allowed to stay under "humanitarian conditions". This has been a part of several concessions asked by both sides to, in essence, circumvent and nullify the [[Palestinian right of return]].

US Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] proposed settling Palestinians refugees in [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] as an alternative to letting them return to former homes in Israel and the occupied territories during a meeting.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/24/condoleezza-rice-palestinian-refugees-south-america | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Rory | last=Carroll | title=Condoleezza Rice: send Palestinian refugees to South America | date=24 January 2011}}</ref> 

In her memoirs, [[Condoleezza Rice]] wrote that Olmert initially proposed that Israel accept 5,000 Palestinians refugees. Abbas rejected the offer, saying that "I can't tell four million Palestinians that only 5,000 of them can go home".<ref name="Rice">{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=243917 |title=Rice reveals concessions in 2008 peace talks |last=Stoil |first=Rebecca Anna |date=11 January 2011 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 }}</ref> According to the second night of the Al-Jazeera broadcast, Israelis and Palestinians eventually agreed that Israel would accept 10,000 refugees.<ref name="gave up">{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/24/papers-palestinian-leaders-refugees-fight?intcmp=239 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Ian | last1=Black | first2=Seumas | last2=Milne | title=Papers reveal how Palestinian leaders gave up fight over refugees | date=24 January 2011}}</ref> 

According to the papers, when the Israelis demanded that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, [[Saeb Erekat]] said "call it what you want... it's their issue, not mine".<ref>[http://www.glz.co.il/newsArticle.aspx?newsid=76317 <U+05DC><U+05D1><U+05E0><U+05D9> <U+05D4><U+05E6><U+05D9><U+05E2><U+05D4> <U+05DC><U+05D4><U+05E2><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05E8> <U+05E2><U+05E8><U+05D1><U+05D9><U+05DD>-<U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DD> <U+05DC><U+05E8><U+05E9><U+05D5><U+05EA>], [[Army Radio (Israel)|Israel Army Radio]] online, 25 January 2011</ref>
