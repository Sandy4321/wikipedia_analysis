Surface weather observations have traditionally been taken at [[airport]]s due to safety concerns during takeoffs and landings.  The [[ICAO]] defines the [[International Standard Atmosphere]] (also known as [[ICAO Standard Atmosphere]]), which is the model of the standard variation of [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[density]], and [[viscosity]] with [[altitude]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. This is useful in calibrating instruments and designing aircraft,<ref name="ICAO 1993">ICAO, ''[http://www.icao.int/cgi/goto_m.pl?isbn/index.html Manual of the ICAO Standard Atmosphere (extended to 80 kilometres (262 500 feet))]'', Doc 7488-CD, Third Edition, 1993, ISBN 92-9194-004-6</ref> and is used to reduce a station's pressure to [[sea level pressure]] where it can then be used on [[weather map]]s.<ref>Patricia M. Pauley.

In the United States, the [[FAA]] mandates the taking of weather observations for safety reasons.  To help facilitate the purchase of an [[automated weather observing system]], such as [[ASOS]], the FAA allows federal dollars to be used for the installation of certified weather stations at airports.<ref>Allweatherinc. [http://www.allweatherinc.com/pdf/why_buy_an_awos.pdf Why buy an AWOS?] Retrieved on [[2008-01-12]].</ref>  The airport observations are then transmitted worldwide using the [[METAR]] observing code.  METAR reports typically come from [[airport]]s or permanent weather observation stations.  Reports are generated once an hour; however, if conditions change significantly, they may be updated in special reports called SPECI's.<ref>[[National Climatic Data Center]].

==Data Reported==
Surface weather observations can include the following elements:
*The '''Station Identifier''', or [[Location identifier]], consists of four characters for METAR observations,<ref> [[Texas A & M University]]. [http://www.met.tamu.edu/class/METAR/metar-pg5.html Coding the Type of Report, Station Identifier, Date/Time, and Report Modifier groups.] Retrieved on [[2008-04-06]].</ref> with the first representing the region of the world the station lies within.  For example, the first letter for areas in and around the Pacific ocean is P, and for Europe is E.  The second character may represent the country/state the location lies within.  For Hawaii, the first two letters are "PH" while for Great Britain, the first two letters of the station identifie are "EG".  Canada and the contiguous United States are an exception, with the first letters C and K representing the regions, respectively.  The final two or three letters normally represent the name of the location or airport.
*'''[[Visibility]]''', measured in [[meter]]s for most sites worldwide, except in the United States where statute miles are reported.<ref name="NWSMETAR">[[National Weather Service]].

*'''[[Temperature]]''' is a measure of the [[kinetic energy]] of a sample of matter.  Temperature is the unique physical property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact.  If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature;<ref name="temp">Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=temperature1 Temperature.] Retrieved on [[2008-04-06]].</ref> otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object.  Temperature, within [[meteorology]], is measured with [[thermometer]]s exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=air-temperature1 Air Temperature.] Retrieved on [[2008-04-06]].</ref>  In most of the world, the [[degree Celsius]] scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes.  However, the United States is the last major country in which the [[degree Fahrenheit]] temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular [[meteorology]], and government.<ref name="NWSMETAR">[[National Weather Service]].

*'''[[Dew Point]]''' is the [[temperature]] to which a given parcel of [[air]] must be cooled, at constant [[barometric pressure]], for [[water vapor]] to [[Condensation|condense]] into water. The condensed water is called [[dew]]. The dew point is a [[saturation]] point.  When the dew point temperature falls below freezing it is called the frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates [[frost]] or [[frost#Hoar frost|hoarfrost]] by [[deposition (meteorology)|deposition]].<ref>Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=dewpoint1 Dewpoint.] Retrieved on [[2008-04-06]].</ref>  The dew point is associated with relative [[humidity]].  A high [[relative humidity]] indicates that the dew point is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature.  Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity.  At a given [[barometric pressure]], independent of temperature, the dew point determines the [[specific humidity]] of the air.  The dew point is an important statistic for [[general aviation]] pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of [[carburetor icing]] and [[fog]].  When used with the air temperature, a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology.

*'''[[Wind|Wind speed and direction]]''' is determined using [[anemometer]]s located a standard {{convert|10|m|ft}} above ground level.  Average wind speed is measured using a two-minute average in the United States,<ref name="fmh1">Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology.

Wind gusts are reported when there is variation of the wind speed of more than {{convert|10|kn|m/s}} between peaks and lulls during the sampling period.<ref name="fmh1">Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology.

*'''[[Sea level pressure]]''' is the pressure at sea level or (when measured at a given elevation on land) the station pressure reduced to sea level assuming an isothermal layer at the station temperature.  This is the pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the Internet.  When barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure reduced to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.   The reduction to sea level means that the ''normal range of fluctuations'' in pressure is the same for everyone. The pressures which are considered ''high pressure'' or ''low pressure'' do not depend on geographical location. This makes [[isobar]]s on a weather map meaningful and useful tools.<ref>Patricia M. Pauley.

*'''[[Altimeter|Altimeter setting]]''' is a term and quantity used in [[aviation]].  The regional or local air pressure at mean sea level is called the altimeter setting, and the pressure which will calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground at a given [[airport|airfield]].<ref>[[USA Today]]. [http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wbarocx.htm Understanding Air Pressure.] Retrieved on [[2008-04-14]].</ref>
*'''Present weather''', which present restrictions to visibility or presence of [[thunder]] or [[squall]]s, are reported in observations to indicate to aviation any possible threats during landings and takeoffs from airports.  Types included in surface weather observations include precipitation, obscurations, other weather phenomena such as, well-developed dust/sand whirls, squalls, tornadic activity, sandstorms, [[volcanic ash]], and duststorms.<ref>[[Texas A&M University]].

*'''Intensity of precipitation''' is primarily measured for meteorological concerns.  However, it can be of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility.  Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since it can be an in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.<ref>Ben C. Bernstein, Thomas P. Ratvasky, Dean R. Miller, and Frank McDonough.

*'''[[Precipitation]] amount''' over the past 6 or 24 hours is of particular interest to [[meteorologist]]s in verifying forecast amounts of precipitation and determining station climatologies.  
*'''[[Snowfall]] amount''' during the past 6 hours is taken for meteorological and climatological concerns.
*'''Snow depth''' is measured for meteorological and climatological concerns once a day.  However, during periods of snowfall, it is measured each six hours to determine amount of recent snowfall.<ref>[[NOAA]] Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System.

Personal weather stations, maintained by citizens rather than government officials, do not use METAR code.  Software allows information to be transmitted to various sites, such as Weather Underground globally,<ref name="WU">Weather Underground. [http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/index.asp Personal Weather Station.] Retrieved on [[2008-03-09]].</ref> or [[CWOP]] within the [[United States]],<ref>Russ Chadwick.

==Use on weather maps==
[[Image:Station model.gif|thumb|right|200px|Station model used on surface weather maps]]
{{Main articles|Weather maps|Station model}}
Data collected by land locations coding in METAR are conveyed worldwide via phone lines or wireless technology.  Within many nations' meteorological organizations, this data is then plotted onto a weather map using the [[station model]].  A station model is a symbolic illustration showing the [[weather]] occurring at a given [[Weather station|reporting station]].<ref>Steve Ackerman and Tom Whittaker. [http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/station/page2.html Station Model.] Retrieved on [[2008-03-27]].</ref>  Meteorologists created the station model to plot a number of weather elements in a small space on [[weather map]]s.<ref>Illinois Central College. [http://faculty.icc.edu/easc111lab/labs/labj/prelab_j.html LAB J: Weather Maps and Humidity.] Retrieved on [[2008-03-27]].</ref>  Maps filled with dense station-model plots can be difficult to read, but they allow meteorologists, pilots, and mariners to see important weather patterns.
 
Weather maps are used to display information quickly showing the analysis of various meteorological quantities at various levels of the atmosphere, in this case the surface layer.<ref>Encarta. [http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chart.html Chart.] Retrieved on [[2007-11-25]].</ref>  Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of [[isotherm]]s, which more readily identifies temperature gradients,<ref>DataStreme. [http://dstreme.comet.ucar.edu/extras/sample.act.html AIR TEMPERATURE PATTERNS.] Retrieved on [[2007-11-25]].</ref> and can help in the location of [[weather fronts]].  Two-dimensional [[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines|streamline]]s based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern.  A popular type of surface weather map is the [[surface weather analysis]], which plots [[isobar]]s to depict areas of [[high pressure]] and [[low pressure]].

==Ship and buoy reports==
[[Image:Buoys.svg|thumb|right|200 px|Different shapes and sizes of buoys]] 
For over a century, reports from the world's oceans have been received real-time for safety reasons and to help with general weather forecasting.  The reports are coded using the [[SYNOP|synoptic code]], and relayed via [[radio]] or [[satellite]] to weather organizations worldwide.<ref>[[National Weather Service]]. [http://www.vos.noaa.gov/ObsHB-508/ObservingHandbook1_2004_508_compliant.pdf National Weather Service Observing Handbook 1:  Marine Surface Weather Observations.] Retrieved on [[2008-01-13]].</ref>  Buoy reports are automated, and maintained by the country that moored the buoy in that location.  Larger moored buoys are used near shore, while smaller drifting buoys are used farther out at sea.<ref>National Data Buoy Center. [http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/mooredbuoy.shtml Moored Buoy Program.] Retrieved on [[2008-01-13]].</ref>

Due to the importance of reports from the surface of the ocean, the [[voluntary observing ship program]], known as VOS, was set up to train crews how to take weather observations while at sea and also to calibrate weather sensors used aboard ships when they arrive in port, such as [[barometer]]s and [[thermometer]]s.<ref>National Data Buoy Center. [http://www.vos.noaa.gov/vos_scheme.shtml The WMO Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) Scheme.] Retrieved on [[2008-01-13]].</ref>  The [[beaufort scale]] is still generally used to determine wind speed from manual observers out at sea.  Ships with [[anemometers]] have issues with determining wind speeds at higher wind speeds due to blockage of the instruments by increasing high seas.

==Use in establishing climate of a location==
{{main article|Climate}}
Climate, (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''klima'') is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period of time.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=climate1 Climate.] Retrieved on [[2008-03-09]].</ref>  The standard averaging period is 30 years for an individual location,<ref>MetOffice.

Climate includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) glossary definition is:                                                                                    
: ''Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the <U+201C>average weather<U+201D>, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization ([[WMO]]). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.''<ref>[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]. [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/518.htm Appendix I: Glossary.] Retrieved on [[2007-06-01]].</ref>

The main difference between climate and everyday weather is best summarized by the popular phrase "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."<ref>National Weather Service Office Tucson, Arizona. [http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/ Main page.] Retrieved on [[2007-06-01]].</ref>  Over [[history|historic]] time spans there are a number of static variables that determine climate, including: latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains.  Degree of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption, water retention, and [[rainfall]] on a regional level.
