'''Joshua David Bard''' (born [[March 30]], [[1978]], in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York]]) is a [[catcher]] for the [[San Diego Padres]].  He played for the [[Cleveland Indians]] from [[2002 in baseball|2002]] through [[2005 in baseball|2005]], and was acquired by the [[Boston Red Sox]] on [[January 27]], [[2006 in baseball|2006]], along with [[outfielder]] [[Coco Crisp]] and [[reliever]] [[David Riske]], for reliever [[Guillermo Mota]], [[third base|third-base]] prospect [[Andy Marte]], and catcher [[Kelly Shoppach]].  Bard is a [[switch-hitter]] who throws [[right-handed|right]].  He became the Red Sox's backup catcher during Spring Training 2006 following the retirement of [[John Flaherty]].  

Bard attended [[Cherry Creek High School]] in [[Greenwood Village, Colorado]], and was a two-time All-American while playing for [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]]. Bard is married to his high-school sweetheart and has two children.

At the time, Bard was one of the best catching prospects, and he also played third base occasionally with Triple A team Buffalo.

On August 23, 2002, Bard hit a walk-off home run in his his Major League debut for Cleveland (against Seattle), becoming the second player to accomplish the feat in his ML debut (Billy Parker, CAL, 9/9/71 vs. Milwaukee).

In [[2003 in baseball|2003]], Bard posted a .244 [[batting average|average]] with 8 [[home runs]] and 36 [[RBI]] in 91 [[game]]s played.  He spent the first half of [[2004 in baseball|2004]] on the [[disabled list]] due to an abdominal injury, and then spent nearly the rest of the season in the minors.  In 2005, he returned to the Indians roster, backing up [[V<U+00ED>ctor Mart<U+00ED>nez (baseball)|V<U+00ED>ctor Mart<U+00ED>nez]].

As a member of the [[Boston Red Sox]] in April of 2006, his primary duties were catching [[knuckleball]] pitcher [[Tim Wakefield]].  In the beginning of the season, this proved to be a challenging task, as Bard gave up 3 [[passed ball]]s in his first appearance for the Red Sox on April 5th, 2006. In an April 26, 2006, game against the [[Cleveland Indians]], Josh Bard gave up 4 passed balls, giving him a total of 10 passed balls in his first 5 games.

On [[May 1]], [[2006]], days after [[Doug Mirabelli]] was traded from Boston to the [[San Diego Padres]], Bard was traded to the Padres along with minor league pitcher [[Cla Meredith]] for Mirabelli.  He made his first appearance for the Padres on [[May 5]], [[2006]], against the [[Chicago Cubs]]. 

Upon his arrival in the [[National League]], Bard became one of the best hitters in the major leagues. A lifetime .240 hitter before joining the Padres, Bard hit .338 in 231 at-bats the rest of the season as the backup to [[Mike Piazza]]. However, the hot hitting did not continue the following season, when Bard became the Padres' starting catcher, with [[Rob Bowen]] as his backup. On June 20, 2007, Bowen was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for [[catcher]], [[Michael Barrett]]. This will significantly cut Bard's playing time.[http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070620&content_id=2038291&vkey=news_sd&fext=.jsp&c_id=sd]

Bard was behind the plate on [[August 4]], [[2007]] for a home game against the [[San Francisco Giants]].  He was catching for pitcher [[Clay Hensley]] when Hensley gave up home run 755 to [[Barry Bonds]], which tied Bonds with [[Hank Aaron]] for most career home runs.
