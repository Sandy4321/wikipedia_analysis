'''Pearson's Candy Company''' is a [[chocolate]] and [[confectionery]] manufacturer headquartered in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]].  Founded as a confectionery [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] firm in 1909, the company began to manufacture its own products in 1912.  Originally a family-owned company, Pearson's experienced changes in ownership, acquisitions and product alterations in the 1960s and 70s, before being purchased by the current owners in 1989.<ref name="industry"/>

Pearson's products are produced on three production lines in the company<U+2019>s Saint Paul plant.  The company sells its Mint Patties nationally and its [[Nut Goodie]] and [[Salted Nut Roll]] products in several [[midwest]]ern states.

==History==
===Pearson family===
Pearson's Candy Company was founded as a confectionery distribution firm in 1909 by P. Edward Pearson and his brothers, John and Oscar.  Two more brothers, Waldemar and C. Fritz, joined the company several years later.<ref name="pearsons">{{cite web |url = http://www.pearsonscandy.com/about_us.cfm |title = About Us |author = Pearson's Candy Company |accessdate= 2008-01-01 |language = English}}</ref> The five brothers determined manufacturing would be more profitable than distribution and, in 1912, introduced their first confection, the [[Nut Goodie]].<ref name="candy">Kimmerle, pp. 138&ndash;139</ref>  

Pearson's grew and began manufacturing for other companies, including Whitmans and [[Planters]].  Pearson's introduced the [[Salted Nut Roll]] in 1933, at the height of [[The Great Depression]].<ref name="candy"/>  The success of the Salted Nut Roll prompted other manufacturers to mimic the product.  Pearson's  subsequently changed the roll's name to the Choo Choo Bar, to distinguish the product.  The Choo Choo name, however, was not as successful, and the original name was restored with the Pearson's [[logo]] more prominently displayed.<ref name="pearsons"/>

By the end of [[World War II]], the Pearson brothers had dropped the distribution aspect of the business.  The youngest brother, William Pearson, joined the family business in 1944, as did George Pearson, son of founder P. Edward Pearson.  In 1951, Pearson's acquired the Trudeau Candy Company, which brought [[Mint Patties]] and the Seven Up bar to Pearson's product line.  The company moved to a new manufacturing plant at its current address in 1959.<ref name="candy"/>  In 1962, Pearson<U+2019>s acquired [[Milwaukee]]-based Sperry Candy Company, a company known for its Chicken Dinner Bar.  Pearson's, however, sold Sperry Candy to the Schuler Chocolate Factory of [[Winona, Minnesota]] five years later.<ref>{{cite news |last=Moskowitz |first=Dara |url=http://www.citypages.com/databank/19/942/article6825.asp|title=The Ghost of Candy Bars Past|publisher=City Pages|date=1998-12-23|accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref>

===Ownership changes===
The Pearson family sold the company in 1968 to ITT/Continental Baking, a [[New York City|New York]] firm.  ITT/Continental Baking sold the company to an out-of-state confectionery partnership in 1979.  During this time, sales declined due to problems with availability and product changes, such as a [[wrapper]] redesign and [[recipe]] change of the Nut Goodie.<ref name="pearsons"/>

In 1985, the company was purchased by Larry Hassler and Judith Johnston, the current [[CEO]] and [[Chief Operating Officer|COO]], respectively.  The company<U+2019>s previous owners had split up, causing the [[bank]] to offer the company in the [[leveraged buyout]].  The Nut Goodie's original wrapper and recipe were restored and, despite the loss of a label contract with [[General Mills]] to produce Nature Valley [[granola]] bars, which accounted for 1.4 million bars daily and 85 percent of the company's total tonnage, Pearson's became profitable again in December 1992.<ref name="industry"/>  In early 1998, Pearson's acquired the Bun Bar trademark from [[Clark Bar]] America. Pearson's introduced Flurries in 2004.<ref name="pearsons"/>

==Products==
[[Image:Nutgoodie.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Nut Goodie]]
===Current products===
Salted Nut Rolls and Mint Patties account for approximately 80 percent of the company<U+2019>s sales; Nut Goodie and Bun Bars account for the remainder.  Mint Patties are sold nationally and Salted Nut Rolls are available in approximately 60 percent of the company's outlets.  In the [[Twin Cities]], Salted Nut Rolls consistently rank number one or number three in sales.<ref name="industry"/>  Although the products are not sold internationally, the company is the 99th largest confectionery company in the world by revenue.<ref name="global"/>

Pearson's utilizes 200 tons of [[peanut]]s, 400 tons of [[sugar]], 100 tons of [[chocolate]] and 350 tons of [[corn syrup]] per month.  Products are produced in the company<U+2019>s 130,000 sq. ft. plant on three production lines.<ref name="industry"/>  Current products include:

===Discontinued products===
====Seven Up Bar====
The Seven Up Bar was a [[candy bar]] comprising seven different chocolate "pillows", each filled with a different [[flavor]].  Flavors changed with the availability and popularity of ingredients, which included, among others, [[brazil nut]], [[buttercream]], [[butterscotch]], caramel, [[cherry]], [[coconut]], fudge, mint, nougat and [[Orange (fruit)|orange]].<ref name="candy"/>  The high manufacturing costs and [[trademark]] issues with a [[soda]] manufacturer (The American Bottling Company, today [[Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages|Cadbury Schweppes]]), caused the bar to be retired in 1979.<ref name="bar">Lewis, p. 68</ref>

====Chicken Dinner Bar====
The Chicken Dinner Bar had been a product of the Sperry Candy Company, which was acquired by Pearson<U+2019>s in 1962.  The bar, introduced during The Great Depression, was so called in reference to President [[Herbert Hoover]]<U+2019>s promise of <U+201C>a chicken in every pot<U+201D>.<ref>Hale, p. 55</ref>  The bar did not contain [[chicken]] or other [[poultry]] products, but was, rather, a chocolate-covered [[nut]] roll.  Pearson<U+2019>s discontinued the bar<U+2019>s production after the acquisition.<ref name="bar"/>
