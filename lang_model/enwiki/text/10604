The '''AK-47''' ({{lang-ru |<U+0410><U+0432><U+0442><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+0442> <U+041A><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430><U+0448><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430> <U+043E><U+0431><U+0440><U+0430><U+0437><U+0446><U+0430> 1947 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430>, ''Avtomat Kalashnikova 1947''}}) is a [[gas-operated]] [[assault rifle]] designed by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]], produced by [[Russia]]n manufacturer [[IZH]] and used in many [[Eastern bloc]] nations during the [[Cold War]]. It was adopted and standardized in [[1947]]<ref>Poyer, Joe. The AK-47 and AK-74 Kalashnikov Rifles and Their Variations (Paperback). North Cape Publications. 2004. pp1.
</ref>.
Compared with the auto-loading [[rifle]]s used in [[World War II]], the AK-47 was generally lighter, more compact, with a shorter range, a smaller [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm]] cartridge, and was capable of [[selective fire]]. It was one of the first true assault rifles and remains the most widely used. The AK-47 and its numerous variants and descendants have been produced in greater numbers than any other assault rifle and are in production to this day.<ref>Ibid.</ref>

==History==
===Design background===
During World War II, [[Germany]] was the first nation to develop weapons that embodied the characteristics of the modern assault rifle. The impetus for the adoption of the assault rifle as the primary individual infantry weapon was the knowledge that, in modern warfare, dismounted troops typically exchange small arms fire at ranges of fewer than 300 meters; in most firefights, combatants are within 100 meters of each other. The power and range of most contemporary [[service rifle]] cartridges was not necessary for the vast majority of engagements with small arms. As a result, military authorities saw the need to develop a cartridge and firearm combining the features of a [[submachine gun]] (high-capacity magazine and [[Automatic firearm|fully-automatic]] fire capability) with an intermediate-power cartridge that would be effective to a range of 300 meters. For the sake of reducing manufacturing costs, this was done by shortening the [[7,92 x 57 mm|8 mm Mauser]] cartridge to 33 mm and using a lighter bullet.  

The resulting [[Sturmgewehr 44]] (StG44) was not the first rifle to use these features; it was preceded by earlier [[Italy|Italian]] and Russian designs, such as the Tokarev [[SVT-40]]. The Germans were, however, the first to produce and field a sufficient number of the type to properly evaluate its utility. They fielded the weapon in large numbers against the Russians towards the end of the war. This experience deeply influenced Russian doctrine in the years following the war.<ref>Infantry Discussion Board. "RE:7.62x39mm ammo to stay, 5.56mm to go." Internet, available from http://www.strategypage.com/messageboards/messages/1-8383.asp. Accessed 07/20/2006.</ref><ref>http://www.headsbunker.com/html/2005/04/firearm-feature-el-chopo-cetme-modelo.html</ref>
[[Image:Young kalashnikov.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Mikhail Kalashnikov in the late 1940s]]

Mikhail Kalashnikov began studying automatic weapons design while still in the hospital<ref>Poyer, 7</ref>, after being wounded in the battle of [[Bryansk]]<ref>Ezell, Edward Clinton. Small Arms of the World. 12th Edition. Barnes & Noble. 1983. pp36.</ref>. As he convalesced, he began working at the Matai Arms Depot where he continued his design work. He had been informed that a new weapon was required for the 7.62 <U+00D7> 41 mm cartridge developed in 1943. His initial attempt at designing a new submachine gun offered no significant innovations or advantage over other designs<ref>Poyer,  7</ref>, and A.I. Sudayev's [[PPS43]] submachine gun was preferred to Kalashnikov's design<ref>Ezell, 37</ref>. Kalashnikov redesigned his losing design after examining a German StG44 in 1946. Following Soviet practice in other industries, Kalashnikov was possibly chosen to lead a team of designers more for propaganda value due to his war-hero status rather than for his expertise.

===Design concept===
Despite circumstantial evidence, Mikhail Kalashnikov denies that his rifle was ''based'' on the German assault rifle. It is best described as a hybrid of several previous innovations. To support his position, the AK-47 owes more to the [[M1 Garand]] Rifle than any German design. The double locking lugs, unlocking raceway, and trigger mechanism are clearly derived  from the earlier American design.<ref>http://www.ak-47.net/ak47/galil.html</ref> This is not surprising as millions of Garand rifles had operated reliably in combat around the globe. Though mechanically similar to the Garand, the AK-47 borrows its cartridge concept, weapon layout, gas system, and construction methods from the StG44.<ref>http://www.efour4ever.com/stg44.htm</ref> Further, the safety is surprisingly similar<ref>http://www.remington.com/library/history/firearm_models/centerfire/model_8.asp</ref> to the [[John Browning|Browning]] designed [[Remington Arms|Remington]] Model 8 rifle.

The genius in the design of the Kalashnikov rifle is in the simplification of those contributing designs and adaptation to mass production. The AK-47 can be seen as a fusion of the best that the M1 Garand offered combined with the best aspects of the StG44 made by the best processes available in the Soviet Union at the time.

{{cquote|The operating mechanism of the Kalashnikov family of weapons is basically very similar to that of the US M1 and M14 rifles and M1/M2 carbines. In fact, as is often the case in a successful weapon design, there is little new about the individual elements of Kalashnikov<U+2019>s design; the inventor<U+2019>s accomplishment was in the recombination of known elements into a compact, reliable and durable package. ''<U+2014>Ed Ezell''}}

===Receiver development history===
[[Image:AK-47 and SKS DD-ST-85-01268.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Type 3 AK-47, with its predecessor, the [[SKS]]]]
[[Image:AKMS and AK-47 DD-ST-85-01270.jpg|right|thumb|250px|AKS-47 on a Type 4B receiver (top), with a Type 2A.]]

There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had stamped sheet metal [[Receiver_(firearms)|receivers]]. Difficulties were encountered welding the guide and ejector rails causing high rejection rates.<ref>Poyer, 8</ref> Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver.<ref>Poyer, 9</ref> This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier [[Mosin-Nagant]] rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim [[SKS]] rifle continued.<ref>Poyer, 9</ref>

Once manufacturing difficulties had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the AKM (''M'' for ''modernized'' or ''upgraded''<U+2014>in Russian: <U+0410><U+0432><U+0442><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+0442> <U+041A><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430><U+0448><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0434><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+0438><U+0437><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439>) was introduced in 1959<ref>Ezell, 36</ref>. This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted [[muzzle brake]] on the end of the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] to compensate for muzzle rise under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added in order to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed) during rapid or automatic fire.<ref>Poyer, 11</ref> This is also sometimes referred to as a "cyclic rate reducer", or simply "rate reducer", as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during automatic fire.<ref>Ezell, 36</ref>  It was also lighter than the previous, roughly two-thirds of the weight<ref>Ibid.</ref>. Both licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM, partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver. This model is the most commonly encountered, having been produced in much greater quantities. All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West, although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original 3 receiver types<ref>Poyer, 2</ref>. In most former Eastern Bloc countries, the weapon is known simply as the "Kalashnikov". The photo at right illustrates the differences between the Type 2 milled receiver and the Type 4 stamped, including the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver, as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization.

==Features==
[[Image:AK-components.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A diagram showing the design of AKM.]]
The AK-47 is simple and inexpensive to manufacture and easy to clean and maintain. Its ruggedness and reliability are legendary.<ref>http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20030423.asp</ref><ref>http://kalashnikov.guns.ru/wwwboard/board4/messages/2114.html</ref><ref>http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/AK-47</ref><ref>http://www.booktrail.com/Video_Shooting/AKS,%20AK-47%20&%20MAK-90%20Type%20Armorer's%20Course.asp</ref> The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. This reliability comes without a cost of accuracy, as the looser tolerances still allow the precision and consistency that are required of accurate firearms. However it is important to bear in mind that accuracy was not the feature most desired of this design yet still present. Reflecting Soviet infantry doctine of its time, the rifle is meant to be part of massed infantry fire, not long range engagements.

The notched rear tangent iron sight is adjustable, each setting denoting hundreds of meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Windage adjustment is done by the armory prior to issue. The battle setting places the round within a few centimeters above or below the point of aim out to approximately 250 meters. This "[[point-blank range]]" setting allows the shooter to fire the gun at any close target without adjusting the sights. Longer settings are intended for area suppression. These settings mirror the [[Mosin-Nagant]] and [[SKS]] rifles which the AK-47 replaced. This eased transition and simplified training.
 
The [[bore]] and [[chamber]], as well as the gas piston and the interior of the [[gas cylinder]], are generally [[chromium]] plated. This plating dramatically increases the life of these parts by resisting corrosion and wear. This is particularly important, as most military-production ammunition during the 20th century contained corrosive mercuric salts in the primers, which mandated frequent and thorough cleaning in order to prevent damage. Chrome plating of critical parts is now common on many modern military weapons.<ref>"Chrome-lined or non chrome-lined barrel?." Internet, available from http://www.thehighroad.org/archive/index.php/t-6372.html. Accessed 07/19/2006</ref>

===Operating cycle===
[[Image:AKAnimation.gif|thumb|right|300px|Animation demonstrating the AK-47's operating cycle]]

To fire, the operator inserts a loaded [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]], moves the selector lever to the lowest position, pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the [[trigger (mechanism)|trigger]]. In this setting, the gun fires only once (semi-automatic), requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. With the selector in the middle position (full-automatic), the rifle continues to fire, automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. As each bullet travels through the barrel, a portion of the gases expanding behind them are diverted into the gas tube above the barrel, where they impact the gas piston. This in turn is driven backward, pushing the bolt carrier, which causes the bolt to move backwards, ejecting the spent round, and chambering a new round when the recoil spring pushes it back.<ref>Department of the Army. Operators Manual for AK-47 Asssault Rifle. 203d Military Intelligence Batallion</ref>

===Disassembly===
Dismantling the rifle involves the operator depressing the magazine catch and removing the magazine. The charging handle is pulled to the rear and the operator inspects the chamber to verify the gun is unloaded. The operator presses forward on the retainer button at the rear of the receiver cover while simultaneously lifting up on the rear of the cover to remove it. He then pushes the spring assembly forward and lifts it from its raceway, withdrawing it out of the bolt carrier and to the rear. The operator must then pull the carrier assembly all the way to the rear, lift it, and then pull it away. He removes the bolt by pushing it to the rear of the bolt carrier; rotating the bolt so the camming lug clears the raceway on the underside of the bolt carrier and then pulls it forward and free. When cleaning, the operator will pay special attention to the barrel, bolt face, and gas piston, then oil lightly and reassemble.<ref>Ibid</ref>

===Ballistics===
The standard AK-47 or AKM fires a [[7.62 x 39 mm|7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|round]] with a muzzle velocity of 710 m/s (2,329 ft/s). Muzzle energy is 1,990 [[joule]]s (1,467 [[Foot-pound force|ft<U+2022>lb]]). Cartridge case length is 38.6 mm, weight is 18.21 [[Gram|g]]. Projectile weight is normally 8 g (123 [[Grain (measure)|gr]]). The AK-47 and AKM, with the 7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm cartridge, have a maximum effective range of around 300 meters. For comparison, the [[7.62 x 54 mm R|7.62 <U+00D7> 54 mm R]] cartridge has a projectile of 9.6-12 g (148-185 gr [depending on the weapon]) at a velocity of 818 m/s (2,683 ft/s) for approximately 4,000 joules (2,950 ft<U+2022>lb) of energy.

==Legal status==
===In the United States===
[[Image:Misccaparms.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Arms captured in [[Fallujah]] by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]], including two AKMs (first and third rifles from the left)]]

Private ownership of fully-automatic AK-47 rifles is tightly regulated by the [[National Firearms Act]] (NFA) of 1934. The [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] ceased importing of foreign-manufactured fully-automatic firearms for civilian sales and possession, effectively halting further importation of civilian accessible AK-47 rifles. In 1986, an amendment to the [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] stopped all future domestic manufacture of fully-automatic weapons for civilian use.

However, machine guns manufactured domestically prior to 1986 and imported prior to 1968 may be transferred between civilians in accordance with federal and state law. Several Soviet and Chinese rifles made it into the U.S. during the mid-1960s, when returning Vietnam veterans brought them home after capture from enemy troops. Many of these were properly registered during the 1968 NFA amnesty. In addition, several states have laws on their books outlawing private possession of fully-automatic firearms even with NFA approval.

Certain [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] AK-47 models were banned by the now-expired [[Federal assault weapons ban|Assault Weapons Ban]] of 1994<U+2013>2004.

Currently, the only federal law regulating the assembly or possession of semi-automatic AK-47-type weapons in the United States is 18 USC 922r. Commonly known as "922r", this section prohibits the domestic assembly of any firearm which would be ineligible for importation. The effect of this is that no more than 10 of the parts from the following list may be imported (manufactured outside the U.S.):

===In Canada===
In [[Canada]], the AK-47 and variants are illegal for purchase, acquisition, or import, the sole exceptions being the Valmet Hunter, the Valmet Hunter Auto and the Valmet M78 rifles which are based on the AK-47 action.<ref>"List of Restricted and Prohibited Firearms." Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Internet, available from http://www.cfc-cafc.gc.ca/info_for-renseignement/factsheets/r&p_e.asp. Accessed 07/19/2006.</ref> However, as with many gun issues in Canada presently, the particular issue of [[Grandfathering|"grandfathered"]] AK-47 rifles remains unclear.

===In Europe===
Much of [[Western Europe]] has enacted comprehensive national firearms laws which prevent the lawful ownership of AK-47s or variants thereof. The [[United Kingdom]], for instance, has outlawed, through the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988, semi-automatic centerfire rifles (See [[Gun politics in the United Kingdom]] for more complete information). It is possible to own AK derivatives in the UK provided they have been produced as "Manual Straight Pull" rifles which need to be manually cocked after each shot. This involves a modification to the weapon to essentially remove the gas system by permanently closing the gas port above the barrel (may also involve the removal of the gas piston).

In [[Norway]] it is forbidden<ref>{{no icon}}[http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/jd/td-19630125-9722-004.html#2-8 Forskrift om skytev<U+00E5>pen, v<U+00E5>pendeler og ammunisjon, section 2-8]</ref> for civilians to possess any form of fully automatic firearm unless a special permit is issued. Similar laws are in force throughout most of Europe. Fully automatic weapons are either explicitly or effectively outlawed in almost all of North America and Europe, as well as Russia, Japan, and [[Gun politics in Australia|Australia]].

===Illicit trade===
Throughout the world, the AK-47 and variants are among the plethora of commonly smuggled small arms that are sold to governments, rebels, criminals and civilians alike, with little international oversight.  This trade ensures a ready supply of inexpensive weapons to a number of conflicts, including (but certainly not limited to) the [[Balkans]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Somalia]]. In some countries that are recovering from war or that are at war, prices for AK's are very low. In [[Somalia]], [[Rwanda]], [[Mozambique]], [[Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], ... prices are between 30$-125$.<ref>"The AK-47: The World's Favourite Killing Machine." ControlArms Briefing Note. Internet, available from http://www.controlarms.org/find_out_more/reports/AK_47.pdf, accessed 07/28/2006.</ref>

==Cultural influence==
[[Image:Coat_of_arms_of_Mozambique.png|thumb|right|230px|Coat of arms of [[Mozambique]]]]

During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet Union, [[People's Republic of China|China]] and the [[United States]] supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous client-state countries and rebel forces to promote their interests. This period saw the proliferation, sometimes free of charge, of AK-47s by the Soviet Union and China to pro-communist countries and groups such as the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Sandinistas]] and [[Viet-Cong]]. The AK-47 design was spread to a total of 55 national armies.<ref>Gorshkov, Nikolai.</ref>

The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers. The AK-47 is included in the [[flag of Mozambique]] and [[coat of arms]] (formerly also in [[Burkina Faso]] coat of arms) and the [[Hezbollah]] flag. "[[Kalash]]", a shortened form of "[[Kalashnikov]]", is used as a name for boys in some African countries.

In the U.S., movie makers often arm criminals, gang member and terrorist characters in AK-47s (e.g. films like ''[[Boyz N The Hood]]''). Numerous computer games, video games, and rap songs feature AK-47s. Toy makers and the airsoft industry make millions of replica AK-47's.

The sheer ubiquity of the AK-47, its iconography and the fact that it possesses easily the most distinguishable profile ensures a significant and conspicuous impact on society.

==Variants==

Kalashnikov variants include:
*'''AK-47 1948<U+2013>51, 7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm''' <U+2014> The very earliest models with the Type 1 stamped sheet metal receiver are now very rare.
*'''AK-47 1952, 7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm''' <U+2014> Has a milled receiver and wooden [[Stock (firearm)|buttstock]] and handguard. Barrel and chamber are chrome plated to resist corrosion. Rifle weight is 4.2 kg.
*'''AKS-47''' <U+2014> Featured a downward-folding metal stock similar to that of the German [[MP40]], for use in the restricted space in the [[BMP]] infantry combat vehicle.
*'''[[RPK]], 7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm''' <U+2014> Squad automatic rifle version with longer barrel and [[bipod]].
*'''AKM, 7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm''' <U+2014> A simplified, lighter version of the AK-47; Type 4 receiver is made from stamped and riveted sheet metal (see schematic above). A slanted muzzle device was added to counter climb in automatic fire. Rifle weight is 3.61 kg, due to the lighter receiver.
*'''AKMS, 7.62 <U+00D7> 39 mm''' <U+2014> Folding-stock version of the AKM intended for [[airborne]] troops. Stock may be either side- or under-folding
*'''[[AK-74]] series, [[5.45 x 39 mm M74|5.45 <U+00D7> 39 mm]]''' <U+2014> See [[AK-74|main article]] for details.
*'''[[AK-101]]''' series
*'''[[AK-103]]''' series
*'''[[AK-107|AK-107/108]]''' series

In [[1978]], the [[Soviet Union]] began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the [[AK-74]]. This new rifle and cartridge had only started being exported to eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed, drastically slowing production of this and all other small arms.

Certainly more have been produced elsewhere, but the above list represents major producers and variants. An updated AKM design is still produced in Russia.

The basic design of the AK-47 has been used as the basis for other successful rifle designs such as the [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Rk 62|Valmet 62/76]], the [[Israel]]i [[Galil]], the [[India]]n [[INSAS]] and the Yugoslav [[M76 (weapon)|Zastava M76]] and M77/82 (not to be confused with the [[M82 (rifle)|Barrett M82]]) rifles. Several [[bullpup]] designs have surfaced, although none have been produced in quantity. Bullpup conversions are also available commercially. For a complete list, see the [[List of weapons influenced by the Kalashnikov design]].

===Licensing===
Russia has repeatedly claimed that majority of these manufacturers produce AK-47 without a proper [[license]] from [[IZH]]. <ref>"<U+0412><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0447><U+043D><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0415><U+0432><U+0440><U+043E><U+043F><U+0430> <U+0437><U+0430><U+0445><U+0432><U+0430><U+0442><U+0438><U+043B><U+0430> <U+0440><U+044B><U+043D><U+043E><U+043A> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0430><U+0436> <U+0430><U+0432><U+0442><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432> <U+041A><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430><U+0448><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430>".
