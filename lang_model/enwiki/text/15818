==Background==
[[File:MattBarlowBrazil.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Former singer [[Matt Barlow]] left the band to concentrate on his family.]]
On March 3, 2011, Iced Earth vocalist [[Matt Barlow]] issued a statement on the band's official website, stating that he was retiring from the band (for a second time) in to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icedearth.com/news/iced-earth-vocalist-matt-barlow-retires-from-the-band-releases-emotional-statement |title=Iced Earth Vocalist Matt Barlow Retires From The Band, Releases Emotional Statement &#124; The Official Iced Earth Website |publisher=Icedearth.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}</ref> Barlow was still going to take part in the band's upcoming festival shows during the summer, and he played his final show with Iced Earth on August 6, 2011, at the [[Wacken Open Air|Wacken]] festival in [[Germany]].<ref name="'Making of' 4"/>

Shortly after announcing Barlow's departure from the band, Iced Earth announced that [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]] frontman [[Stu Block]] had been chosen as the band's new lead vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icedearth.com/home/iced-earth-leader-chooses-new-vocalist-announces-european-leg-of-massive-world-tour |title=Iced Earth Leader Chooses New Vocalist, Announces European Leg Of Massive World Tour &#124; The Official Iced Earth Website |publisher=Icedearth.com |date=March 16, 2011 |accessdate=2011-010-02}}</ref> According to band founder and rhythm guitarist [[Jon Schaffer]], one of the [[CEO]]s at [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] told him about Stu.<ref name="'Hard Force">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DGhe4JvjHw |title=Jon Schaffer and Stu Block interviewed by 'Hard Force TV' |publisher= |date=October 16, 2011 |accessdate=2011-010-20}}</ref> Although Jon wasn't sure about Block's voice at that point, he was impressed by Block's "presence" and "passion."<ref name="'Hard Force"/> According to Stu, he was then sent some instrumental tracks of older songs, for which he recorded vocals for and sent them back to Jon.<ref name="'Hard Force"/> Stu was then flown out to meet Jon, and to see how the two would gel together.<ref name="'Hard Force"/> During this time, they wrote two songs together; "End of Innocence" and "Dark City."<ref name="'Hard Force"/>

==Writing and recording==

According to Jon Schaffer, his approach to ''Dystopia'' was much more focused compared to previous albums from the last ten years or so, due to his resolved issues with his health, the band's management and the business side of things, among other things.<ref name="Peek from the Pit">{{cite news | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH2FtOvZSds&feature=related | title=Jon Schaffer interviewed on Peek from the Pit. | publisher=YouTube |date= | accessdate =February 6, 2012}}</ref> Jon also cited his "awakening" and the following [[Jon_Schaffer#Sons_of_Liberty|Sons of Liberty]] project for helping him "fall in love" with Iced Earth again, along with Stu Block joining the band.<ref name="Peek from the Pit"/>

A lot of the writing was done at Jon Schaffer's [[home studio]] in [[Indiana]].<ref name="Stu Block interview 2">{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=164713 | title=Stu Block interviewed on "The Aebyss." | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date= | accessdate =October 12, 2011}}</ref> In an interview on The Aebyss, Stu Block talked about the writing process for the album:

{{cquote|Every day, at the end of the day, if we wanted to write a song about a movie, lets say for instance ''V for Vendetta'', [...] we'd just watch the movie [and] I'd jot notes down about the plot and certain things; ideas and all that kind of stuff. And the next morning I'd wake up and start writing to the music.<ref name="Stu Block interview 2"/>}}

The album was recorded at [[Morrisound Recording]] between May and July with producer Jim Morris, who has worked as producer/co-producer and occasional musician on all of the band's albums from ''Burnt Offerings'' on.<ref name="Stu Block interview"/><ref name="Dystopia 2"/> According to Jon Schaffer, he also cleaned-up his guitar tone for ''Dystopia'', compared to previous Iced Earth albums from ''Horror Show'' on.<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite news | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=jr0ryVwXHSc | title=Jon Schaffer interviewed on Music Legends. | publisher= |date= | accessdate =February 12, 2012}}</ref> On July 13, 2011, it was announced that the band were currently master tracking the album in [[Florida]].<ref name="Studio report">{{cite news | url=http://www.icedearth.com/home/studio-report-from-jon-im-very-happy | title=Studio report from Jon Schaffer. | publisher= |date= | accessdate =October 2, 2011}}</ref>

===Songs===
[[File:N704710272 4841669 8858.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Stu Block]] (right) received writing credits on eight of the album's ten songs.]]
While not a concept album, many of the album's songs were inspired by dystopian themes and movies, such as ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[Dark City (1998 film)|Dark City]]'', ''[[Soylent Green]]'', and ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]''.<ref name="Dystopia 2"/> Two songs, "Dystopia" and "Tragedy and Triumph,"  feature the return of Jon Schaffer's [[Something Wicked Saga]], which had previously appeared on the albums ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (Iced Earth album)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', ''[[Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked Part 1|Framing Armageddon]]'' and ''[[The Crucible of Man: Something Wicked Part 2|The Crucible of Man]]''.<ref name="Dystopia 2"/> According to Jon, the first song, "Dystopia", is "a step back timeline-wise" from the last song on ''The Crucible of Man'', "Come What May".<ref name="Dystopia 2"/> While "Come What May" "sets the scenario that it's up to us and the decisions we make that will determine the future of the human race," "Dystopia" takes place "in a time when people are in highly controlled prison-like city states".<ref name="Dystopia 2"/> This leads to their "eventual emancipation" in the last song, "Tragedy and Triumph".<ref name="Dystopia 2"/>

On the idea of continuing the Something Wicked story, Jon Schaffer said:

{{cquote|I remember it hit me like a ton of bricks in '97, the whole Something Wicked story did. I thought, "Man, this is going to be so cool". Many years later, we were on tour for ''Crucible'' and we were doing an interview over in [[Eastern Europe]]. A buddy of mine said, "You know, Jon, this whole Something Wicked thing could be true". I thought about it a moment and said, "Well, I don't know about that. But there are some creepy parallels in contemporary life". So as I was thinking about all of the great movies, albums, and books with dystopian themes, I remembered that conversation and it occurred to me that the Something Wicked story could continue in a few tracks here very nicely.<ref name="Dystopia 2"/>}} 

In an interview on The Aebyss, Schaffer was asked if "Tragedy and Triumph" will be the end of the Something Wicked Saga, to which he replied:

{{cquote|It's my wishful thinking I think, but, you know, at the end of the day that doesn't mean I won't write anything more. I mean the cool thing about the Something Wicked story is that you can take any period of human history, and apply it to the Something Wicked universe and come-up with a badass story to write about, so to say that there's never going to be anymore songs about it would be foolish, because I don't know that, I mean, I'm not thinking about the next record right now, you know. That'll come up in due time and I'll write about whatever I feel like. [That] is the right thing to do just like I always do. What that'll be I don't know, but I know I could tell hours and hours more stories related to the Something Wicked Saga. That's easy. And it's actually fun to do it.</blockquote><ref name="Jon Schaffer interview">{{cite news | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=164501 | title=Jon Schaffer interviewed on The Aebyss. | publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date= | accessdate =October 12, 2011}}</ref>}}

The response to the album has been mostly positive. Mape Ollila, from Imperiumi, called the album "without a doubt Iced Earth's best album as whole since 1996's ''[[The Dark Saga]]'', maybe even better than that," while Max Lussier from The Newreview called the album "easily the best thing to come from the IE camp in nearly a decade."<ref name="Metalstorm.net"/> Caj K<U+00E4>llmalmm from Hallowed also called ''Dystopia'' "by far the best full length album from Iced Earth."<ref name="Hallowed.se"/>

Many of the songs, such as the title track, "Anthem" and "Tragedy and Triumph", have been praised. Mape Ollila described the title-track as "a fast, classic Iced Earth composition"<ref name="Imperiumi.net"/> and Juha Attola from Kaaos called it "familiar Iced Earth."<ref name="Kaaos.fi"/> The title-track was also one of [[Allmusic]]'s  track picks.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Caj K<U+00E4>llmann named "Anthem" as one the albums best songs<ref name="Hallowed.se"/> and Chad Bowar from [[About.com|About]] described it as "appropriately enough, anthemic."<ref name="About.com"/> Keith Chachkes of Metal Army America also called "Anthem" "a rousing call to arms against hypocrisy and sycophants who seem to be overrunning the world these days." Jay Brown from [[Ultimate Guitar]] named "Tragedy and Triumph" his favorite track on the album,<ref name="Ultimate-guitar.net"/> while Ollila called the song "one of the biggest [[Demonstration (people)|rally's]] of Iced Earth's career", and that it makes "an over aged fan boy do a one man [[circle pit]] across his living room."<ref name="Imperiumi.net"/>

Many have also praised Stu Block's performance as the new lead vocalist. Jay Brown felt that Stu Block "makes himself at home as Iced Earth's new singer on ''Dystopia.''"<ref name="Ultimate-guitar.net"/> Caj K<U+00E4>llmalmm called his vocals "very much like Matt Barlow['s], but much better."<ref name="Hallowed.se"/> Mark Gromen from [[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]] praised Block on how he shows off "his ability to tread the lines of both [[Tim "Ripper" Owens]] and Matt Barlow, yet make the song his own"<ref name="Bravewords.com"/> while Chad Bowar also praised Block on how he "brings a varied performance, and delivers the lyrics convincingly no matter if it's an aggressive lower pitched section, traditional singing or belting it out." Keith Chachkes also said that "Stu Block steps right in and does a fantastic job."<ref name="Metal Army America"/>

On the other hand, some have criticized the album. Juha Attola criticized the album for being too much like the bands previous outputs, but still gave positive feedback of Stu Block's vocals.<ref name="Kaaos.fi"/> In the end Attola "was left with a somewhat subdued image of the album", but recommended it for "fans of the band, and for anyone who likes traditional heavy metal." Baz Anderson from [[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]] also recommended the album as "a confidence-boosting album that will be much appreciated and gladly received by anyone with an interest in this long-running and respectable band," but also said that the album "doesn't go beyond being just good."<ref name="Metalstorm.net"/>
