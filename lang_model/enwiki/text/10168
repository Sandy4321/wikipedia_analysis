'''New York State Route 9G''' runs north from [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] at [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie, New York]], starting out as Violet Avenue, then following the [[Hudson River]] mostly along the eastern side of the US 9, crossing over Route 9 just north of [[Rhinebeck, New York]], then running on the western side of US 9, closer to the Hudson River, finally terminating at the junction again with US 9 in [[Hudson, New York]].

The highway starts at a junction with US 9 at [[Marist College]] and [[Saint Francis Hospital]] in the [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] town of Poughkeepsie. It travels parallel to the Pulaski Park while heading south for a time. It turns sharply to the west for a time known as Parker Avenue. It passes north of College Hill Park and Morgan Lake prior to gradually turning north. Route 9G passes west of the [[Dutchess Community College]], now known as Violet Avenue. Proceeding north, off to the east is the Fallkill County Park. An intersection with Dutchess County Route&nbsp;40 is not far off, while another intersection with Dutchess County Route 40A follows. It runs parallel to the [[Eleanor Roosevelt Historic Site]] while it travels west of the Union Cemetery. 9G runs near a small stream for a time, while to the west is the Greentree Park. A turn to the northwest before turning due north again comes before an intersection with Dutchess County Route&nbsp;37. The route enters [[DeWitt Mills, New York|DeWitt Mills]], which brings an intersection with Dutchess County Route&nbsp;14.<ref name="google">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=from:+Parker%20Ave/RT-9G%20@41.710390,%20-73.929500+to:+Columbia%20St/RT-23B/RT-9G%20@42.247761,%20-73.782425 |title=overview map of New York State Route 9G |accessdate=March 3, 2008}}</ref>

On either side of the route are small lakes just as an intersection with Dutchess County Route&nbsp;84 occurs. Continuing north, Burger Hill Park is to the west. From here, an intersection with [[New York State Route 38]] comes with the entering of the northern outskirts of [[Rhinebeck, New York|Rhinebeck]]. It intersects [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] before becoming concurrent with Dutchess County Route 199.[[File:NY 9G dip near Linlithgo.jpg|left|thumb|Long dip to cross creek in Germantown.]] CR 199 turns to the west, and 9G heads north into [[Annadale-On-Hudson, New York|Annadale-On-Hudson]]. [[Bard College]] is just to the west as 9G becomes limited access for a short time. An intersection with Dutchess County Route&nbsp;79 follows, just prior entering [[Tivoli, New York|Tivoli]]. The entering of Tivoli brings the crossing into [[Columbia County, New York]] and an intersection with Dutchess County Route&nbsp;78.<ref name="google"/>

===Columbia County===
In Columbia County, NY 9G passes through Germantown, and meets NY&nbsp;23 at the eastern foot of the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in a highly channelized junction. NY 9G is concurrent with NY&nbsp;23 for just less than {{convert|0.3|mi|km}} before leaving with NY 23B to the northeast for the city of Hudson, passing through its [[Hudson Historic District (New York)|historic downtown]]. The two routes overlap from the NY&nbsp;23 east junction to the US 9 junction on the east side of the city, where the concurrency and NY 9G end.

==History==
[[Image:NY-9F.svg|70px|right|thumb|NY&nbsp;9F<br />(1930 &ndash; late 1930s)|alt=New York State Route 9F shield]]
NY 9G was assigned as part of the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]; however, it extended only from [[U.S. Route 9 (New York)|U.S. Route 9]] in [[Rhinebeck (village), New York|Rhinebeck]] to US 9 in [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]]. South of Annandale-on-Hudson, NY 9G was routed on River and Mount Rutsen Roads. The portion of NY 9G between [[Germantown (town), New York|Germantown]] and [[New York State Route 199|NY 199]], under construction in 1930,<ref name=gb>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> was opened to traffic by 1935.<ref name=1935map>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide - New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref>

Farther south, an alternate route of US 9 between [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] and [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]] via East Park was designated NY&nbsp;9F as part of the 1930 renumbering.<ref name=gb /> By 1935, NY 9F was extended northward from East Park to Rhinebeck, where it ended at a junction with US 9 northeast of the village.<ref name=1935map /> NY 9F was absorbed into a rerouted and extended NY 9G by 1938.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thibodeau |first=William A. |title=The ALA Green Book |edition=1938<U+2013>39 |year=1938 |publisher=Automobile Legal Association}}</ref>

The former routing of NY 9G from Annandale-on-Hudson to Mount Rutsen Road along River Road is now maintained by [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] as part of [[County Route 103 (Dutchess County, New York)|County Route 103]].<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |title=Saugerties Quadrangle - New York |year=1989 |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=x47 |accessdate=March 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |title=Kingston East Quadrangle - New York |year=1989 |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=y47 |accessdate=March 27, 2008}}</ref> In Hyde Park, the former alignment of NY 9F along Market Street remained state-maintained until April 1, 1980, when it was transferred from [[New York State]] to Dutchess County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[New York State Legislature]]|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS|title=Highway Law, Article 12, Section 341|accessdate=March 27, 2008}}</ref> Market Street is now part of [[County Route 41 (Dutchess County, New York)|County Route 41]].<ref>{{cite map |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |title=Hyde Park Quadrangle - New York |year=1989 |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=z47 |accessdate=March 27, 2008}}</ref>
