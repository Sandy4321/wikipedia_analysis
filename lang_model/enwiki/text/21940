Henderson was the leadoff hitter for two World Series champions: the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|1989 Oakland Athletics]] (A's) and the [[1993 Toronto Blue Jays season|1993 Toronto Blue Jays]].

Henderson was a serious Most Valuable Player candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. He hit .319, fourth in the American League, led the league in hits with 135, and in steals with 56. Finishing second to Milwaukee's [[Rollie Fingers]] in the MVP voting, Henderson's fielding that season also earned him his only [[Gold Glove Award]]. Rickey Henderson later became known for his showboating "snatch catches," in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.<ref>{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Rickey|coauthors=John Shea|title=Off Base: Confessions of a Thief|pages=1-10|publisher=HarperCollins|date=June 1992|id=ISBN 0-0601-7975-9}}</ref>

In {{Baseball Year|1982}}, Henderson broke [[Lou Brock]]'s modern major league record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93. [[Tim Raines]] had the next highest stolen base total in 1982 behind Henderson's 130 steals, with 78.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Lou_Brock_1939 | title=The Ballplayers - Lou Brock | publisher=Baseball Library | date=2006 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> As his muscular frame developed, Henderson continued to improve as a hitter.  He developed an increased power-hitting ability, which would eventually lead to the record for home runs to lead off a game.  For his career, he would hit more than 20 home runs in four different seasons, with a high of 28 in {{by|1986}} and again in {{by|1990}}.<ref name="BBRef">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/henderi01.shtml |title=Rickey Henderson Statistics|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-10 |format= |work= }}</ref>

===Back to Oakland (1989<U+2013>1993)===
Following a mid-season trade to Oakland in {{by|1989}}, Henderson reasserted himself as one of the game's greatest players, with a memorable half-season in which his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the A's into the postseason.<ref name="BBRef"/> His 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since {{by|1970}}.  With a record 8 steals in five games, Henderson was MVP of the [[1989 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]; he hit .400 while scoring 8 runs and delivering two home runs, 5 RBI, 7 walks and a 1.000 [[slugging percentage]].  Leading the A's to a four-game sweep over the [[San Francisco Giants]] and the franchise's first [[1989 World Series|World Series]] title since [[1974 World Series|1974]], Henderson hit .474 with a .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases.<ref name="BBRef"/>

A [[1990 in baseball|year later]], Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]] on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, his on-base average was a league-leading .439. With 119 runs scored, 28 homers, 61 RBI and 65 stolen bases, Rickey Henderson won the 1990 [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the [[1990 World Series|World Series]] (.333 batting, .667 slugging, 3 steals in 4 games), but the A's were swept by the underdog [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/ws/yr1990ws.shtml |title=1990 World Series by Baseball Almanac|publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date= |work=}}</ref>

On May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to become the sport's all-time stolen base leader.<ref name="number939"/>

===1993<U+2013>2000===
In July {{by|1993}}, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for [[Steve Karsay]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Herrera (Dominican Republic baseball player)|Jos<U+00E9> Herrera]].<ref name="BBRef"/> He was involved in the final play of the [[1993 World Series|World Series]] that year, as he and [[Paul Molitor]] scored on [[Joe Carter]]'s Series-ending [[walk-off home run]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Sweet Homer|publisher=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/1998/wsarchive/1993.html|accessdate=2008-08-28|date=1993-11-01|last=Rushin|first=Steve}}</ref> After winning his second World Series ring with Toronto, he re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December {{by|1993}}.<ref name="BBRef"/>

In {{by|1994}} and {{by|1995}}, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals, and on base percentage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/henderi01.php |title=Rickey Henderson |publisher=The Baseball Page |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work= }}</ref> His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the American League with a .300 or better average.

In August {{by|1997}}, he was traded by the Padres to the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] for [[Ryan Hancock]] and [[Stevenson Agosto]];<ref name="BBRef"/> his brief stint as an Angel was uneventful. In January {{by|1998}}, he signed as a free agent with the [[Oakland Athletics]], the fourth different time he played for the franchise.<ref name="BBRef"/> That season he led the American League in stolen bases (66) and walks (118), while scoring 101 runs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Kevin_Towers |title=Kevin Towers - BR Bullpen |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work= }}</ref>

A year later, Henderson signed as a free agent with the [[New York Mets]]. In {{by|1999}}, he batted .315 with 37 steals and was 7th in the National League in on base percentage &mdash; his .423 OBP was his 9th year in a row above .400.<ref name="BBRef"/><ref>{{cite web|title=1999 On Base Percentage Leaders: Top 25 in the National League|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-25|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/top25.php?s=OBP&l=NL&y=1999}}</ref> Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit.  Following the Mets' loss in the [[1999 National League Championship Series|1999 NLCS]], the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and [[Bobby Bonilla]].  Both players had been substituted out of the lineup, and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/1999/10/21/mets_ap/|title=Card game: Henderson, Bonilla show up Valentine in Game 6|publisher=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=2008-08-25|date=1999-10-22}}</ref> In [[May 2000|May]] {{by|2000}} he was released by New York, and quickly signed as a free agent with the [[Seattle Mariners]].

In February 2002, he signed as a free agent with the [[Boston Red Sox]], where he became the oldest player to play center field in major league history when he stood in for starter [[Johnny Damon]]. Henderson's arrival was marked by a statistical oddity; since his debut season in 1979 through the 2001 season, he had stolen more bases by himself than his new team had: 1,395 steals for Henderson, 1,382 for the Boston franchise. At 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/Oldest_leagues.shtml | title=A Year-by-Year League Leaders & Records for Oldest Player | publisher=Baseball-Reference.com | date=2007-10-28 | accessdate=2007-11-27}}</ref>

As the {{by|2003}} season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent [[Atlantic League]] with the [[Newark Bears]], hoping for a chance with another major league organization. After much media attention, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] signed him over the [[2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] break.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE1DF1F3AF931A25751C1A96E958260 |title=BASEBALL; Mets and Henderson Are Closing In On Deal|author=Diamos, Jason|publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-03-09}}</ref>

=== Retirement ===
Before the 2003 season, his last, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career: 
{{quote|Each and every day I set a record, but we never talk about it.  We'll talk about a home run hitter 24/7.  Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays.  You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career.  Instead, I think people want me to quit more than anything.<ref name=Manoloff />}} 

Henderson played his last major league game September 19, {{by|2003}}; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return to major league action, his status continued to confound, as he publicly debated his own official retirement from professional baseball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/12/07/SPGALG46E51.DTL|title=Rickey's retirement plans: will he or won't he?|author=|accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the [[Newark Bears]] in the spring of 2004. In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice.<ref name="Baseball Cube" /> On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the [[San Diego Surf Dawgs]] of the [[Golden Baseball League]], a Class-A independent league. This was the SurfDawgs' and the Golden Baseball League's inaugural season and Henderson helped the SurfDawgs to the league championship.  In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenbaseball.com/SanDiego/PlayersBio.aspx?PlayerID=280&SecID=397 |title=San Diego Surf Sawgs|publisher=Golden Baseball League|accessdate=2008-03-09 |format= |work= }}</ref>

Henderson would not accept the end of his MLB career.  In May 2005, he was still insisting that he is capable of playing in the major leagues. It was reported by [[NBC]] and [[ESPN]] that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but this was denied by his agent the following day. On February 10, 2006, Henderson accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the New York Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the SurfDawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. But six weeks later, on August 11, Henderson claimed "It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off," adding, "I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=5417&mode=print |title=The Week In Quotes: August 7-13|last=Erhardt|first=John|publisher=Baseball Prospectus|date=August 14, 2006 |accessdate=2008-03-10 |format= |work= }}</ref>

On May 8, 2007, Henderson again expressed his unquenchable desire to return to major league action: "I see Roger [Clemens] can come back and play. I can come back and play. They say I've done too much... I might come out with some crazy stuff, a press conference telling every club, 'Put me on the field with your best player and see if I come out of it.' If I can't do it, I'll call it quits at the end... I just want a spring training invite... I'm through, really. I'm probably through with it now. It's just one of those things. I thank the good Lord I played as long as I played and came out of it healthy. I took a lot of pounding."<ref name=McCauley>{{cite web|title=Henderson would like one more chance to make a big league team|author=McCauley, Janie|publisher=Associated Press via Yahoo!

On May 18, 2007, the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] reported that Oakland general manager [[Billy Beane]] was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not "infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season," so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Rickey Reunion?|last=Slusser|first=Susan|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 18, 2007|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/18/SPG11PTFL91.DTL|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>  A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum <U+2014> and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me...

Characteristically, he added, "If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070714/SPORTS/707140340 |title=Mets name Henderson new first-base coach; HoJo replaces Down as hitting coach |publisher=The Times Herald Record|author=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work= }}</ref>

=== Coaching ===
The [[New York Mets]] hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach basestealing. Henderson's impact was noticeable on [[Jos<U+00E9> Reyes]], the Mets' current leadoff hitter.<ref>{{cite news|work=Sports Illustrated|title=Untitled|pages=57|publisher=Time Inc.|date=May 7, 2007}}</ref> "I always want to be around the game," Henderson said in May 2007. "That's something that's in my blood.  Helping them have success feels just as good."<ref name=McCauley />  

On July 13, 2007, the New York Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing [[Howard Johnson (baseball)|Howard Johnson]], who became the hitting coach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ti-metshittingcoach071307&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Mets to name Johnson hitting coach |name=Tim Brown |date=[[2007-07-13]] |accessdate=2007-10-03 |publisher=Yahoo Sports}}</ref> Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008.

== Illeism, malapropism and anecdotes==
Henderson was known for being an [[illeist]] by referring to himself in the third person; teammates reported seeing Henderson standing naked in front of a mirror before a game, practicing his swing, and declaring, "Rickey's the best! Rickey's the best!"<ref name="marchman" />  In 2003, he discussed his unusual habit, saying, "People are always saying, 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. I say it when I don't do what I need to be doing. I use it to remind myself, like, `Rickey, what you doing, you stupid....' I'm just scolding myself."<ref name=Manoloff /> [[David Cross]]' comedy album, ''[[Shut Up You Fucking Baby!]]'', has an extended bit about Henderson's illeism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/c/crossdavid-shut.shtml|last=Glauber|first=Gary|date=January 15, 2003 |publisher=PopMatters Music Review|title=David Cross: Shut Up You Fucking Baby! |accessdate=2008-03-10 |format= |work= }}</ref>

There are many anecdotes about Henderson. Padres teammate [[Steve Finley]] once offered him a seat on the team bus, saying that Henderson had [[tenure]]. Henderson replied, "Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years."<ref name="tenure"/> Jon Heyman of [[The Sporting News]] stated he is willing to believe an [[apocryphal]] story of Henderson being so proud of one of his paychecks that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months interest on a $1 million check.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Henderson's antics tarnish his brilliant career|author=Heyman, Jon|journal=The Sporting News via FindArticles|pages=1|date=April 17, 2000|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_16_224/ai_61933906|accessdate=2007-06-24 | volume = 408 | doi = 10.1038/35046237}}</ref> In 2002, Henderson had an argument with [[Orlando Hern<U+00E1>ndez|El Duque]] and stated, "He needs to grow up a little bit.

One widely reported story, according to [[Salon.com]], was a fabrication which began as a clubhouse joke by a visiting player.<ref name="tenure">{{cite news | url=http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/10/09/henderson/print.html | title=Rickey Henderson | first=Allen |last=St. John | publisher=''[[Salon.com]]'' | date=2001-10-09 | accessdate=2008-03-17}}</ref>   While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson supposedly went up to [[John Olerud]], and remarked on Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet out on the field, noting that he used to have a teammate in Toronto who did the same thing, to which Olerud was said to have replied, "That was me." The two men had been together the previous season, with the 1999 New York Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays.

On May 1, {{by|1991}}, Henderson broke one of baseball's most famous records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than [[Lou Brock]].<ref name="number939"/> However, Henderson's achievement was somewhat overshadowed because [[Nolan Ryan]], at age 44, set a record that same night by throwing a [[no-hitter]] against [[Toronto Blue Jays|Toronto]], the seventh of his career. Two years earlier, Ryan had achieved glory at Henderson's expense by making him his 5,000th strikeout victim. Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, "If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smackbomb.com/nolanryan/art-imjustaman.html |title=The Nolan Ryan Express|publisher=The Nolan Ryan Express|author=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work= }}</ref> 

Henderson's speech (at right) after breaking [[Lou Brock]]'s all-time steals record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. Henderson thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. The "I'm the greatest of all time" quote has been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant,<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Real Rickey Henderson|author=Zingler, David|publisher=Simply Baseball Notebook|date=September 2002|url=http://z.lee28.tripod.com/sbnscoverstories/id12.html|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref>  although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer "had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_2_62/ai_95915327|accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |title=One on one with Rickey Henderson: future Hall of Famer - Interview |work= Baseball Digest}}</ref>

Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments:
{{quote|As soon as I said it, it ruined everything. Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say. Those words haunt me to this day, and will continue to haunt me. They overshadow what I've accomplished in this game.<ref name=Manoloff/>
}}

Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said:
{{quote|If you talk about baseball, you can't eliminate me, because I'm all over baseball... It's the truth.  Telling the truth isn't being cocky.  What do you want me to say, that I didn't put up the numbers?  That my teams didn't win a lot of games?  People don't want me to say anything about what I've done.  Then why don't you say it?  Because if I don't say it and you don't say it, nobody says it.<ref name=Manoloff>{{cite journal|title=One on one with Rickey Henderson: future Hall of Famer - Interview|author=Manoloff, Dennis|journal=Baseball Digest via FindArticles|date=February 2003|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_2_62/ai_95915327/pg_1|accessdate=2007-06-24|doi=10.1038/35046237|volume=408|pages=504}}</ref>}} 

As it now stands, however, Henderson has 468 more stolen bases than Brock. For his career, Henderson has 50% more stolen bases (1,406) than the sport's all-time runner-up (938).<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Leaders & Records for Stolen Bases|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SB_career.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the worldwide record established ten years earlier by [[Yutaka Fukumoto]] for the [[Hankyu Braves]] in the [[Japanese Baseball League]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/oak/history/timeline5.jsp |title=History: Athletics Timeline |accessdate=2008-03-09 |format= |publisher=MLB.com }}</ref> In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/SB_leagues.shtml|title=Year-by-Year League Leaders for Stolen Bases|accessdate=2007-06-25|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury,<ref>{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=Henderson Placed on Disabled List|accessdate=2007-06-05|date=[[1987-08-02]]|publisher=[[New York Times]]|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D7173CF931A3575BC0A961948260}}</ref> allowing [[Seattle Mariners]] second baseman [[Harold Reynolds]] to win the title.  He had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest SB leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). It should be noted that caught stealing totals went largely unrecorded until 1920; it is therefore statistically likely that [[Eddie Collins]] (7th in steals) was thrown out more times than Henderson.  However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. ([[Tim Raines]] ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, with 84%.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6604|accessdate=2008-02-17 |publisher=Baseball Prospectus |title=Prospectus Q&A|work= }}</ref> On July 29, {{by|1989}}, Henderson stole 5 bases against the [[Seattle Mariners]]' left-handed [[Randy Johnson (pitcher)|Randy Johnson]], his career high, and one shy of the single-game MLB record. Unusually, Henderson was 0<U+2013>0 in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had eighteen 4-steal games during his career. In August {{by|1983}}, in a 3-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in 5 games.

Longtime scout [[Charlie Metro]] remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: '"I did a lot of study and I found that it's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/quotes/quohenr.shtml|accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |title=Rickey Henderson Quotes|publisher=Baseball Almanac }}</ref>

In July 2007, [[New York Sun]] sportswriter [[Tim Marchman]] wrote about Henderson's accomplishments: 
{{quote|He stole all those bases and scored all those runs and played all those years not because of his body, but because of his brain.  Rickey could tell from the faintest, most undetectable twitch of a pitcher's muscles whether he was going home or throwing over to first. He understood that conditioning isn't about strength, but about flexibility.  And more than anyone else in the history of the game, he understood that baseball is entirely a game of discipline <U+2014> the discipline to work endless 1<U+2013>1 counts your way, the discipline to understand that your job is to get on base, and the discipline to understand that the season is more important than the game, and a career more important than the season.  Maybe he'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like [[Cal Ripken Jr.]], blathering on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else, but we're all better off with things the way they are... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock's stolen base record and proclaimed, 'I am the greatest', but he was, of course, just saying what was plainly true.<ref name="marchman">{{cite journal|title=Rickey Henderson A Steal for the Mets|author=Marchman, Tim|journal=The New York Sun |pages=1|date=July 17, 2007|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/58365|accessdate=2007-07-13|doi=10.1038/35046237|volume=408}}</ref>}}

=== Career milestones ===
As of 2008, Henderson ranks 4th all-time in games played (3,081), 10th in at-bats (10,961), 20th in hits (3,055), and first in runs scored (2,295) and [[stolen base]]s (1,406). His record for most walks all-time (2,190) has since been broken by [[Barry Bonds]]; Henderson is now second.  He also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81; Houston's [[Craig Biggio]] has the second-most ever, with 53. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time Top 100 home run hitters, with 297. [[Bill James]] wrote in 2000, "Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many ''important'' records, as Rickey Henderson."<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill James|title=The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Free Press|year=2001|isbn=0-684-80697-5|pages=Unknown page}}</ref><ref name="fiftyHOF"/> 

Henderson's eight steals during the [[1989 ALCS]] broke Lou Brock's postseason record for a single series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardinals postseason history|publisher=MLB|url=http://www.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20041002&content_id=879243&vkey=news_stl&fext=.jsp&c_id=stl|accessdate=2008-08-28|date=2004-10-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Position-by-position: Yanks in 6|publisher=USA Today|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/00play/fs037.htm|date=2000-10-10|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by [[Kenny Lofton]]'s 34th career steal during the [[2007 ALCS]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Kenny Lofton sets postseason record for stolen bases|publisher=ESPN|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&id=3066983|date=2007-10-27|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> Henderson averaged more steals per game, however, as Lofton has played in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson's 60.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Batting Postseason Leaders|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/leaders_career_bat.shtml|accessdate=2008-08-28|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref name="BBRef"/> As of 2008, Henderson is the only [[American League]] player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Single Season Leaders for Stolen Bases in the American League|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2008-08-26|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hisb2al.shtml}}</ref>, and he is the all-time stolen base leader for two different franchises: the Oakland A's (cumulatively throughout his four tenures with the team)<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebrating 40 Years of Oakland Athletics|publisher=MLB|url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/oak/fan_forum/anniversary.jsp|accessdate=2008-08-29}}</ref><ref name="BBRef"/> and the New York Yankees.<ref name="Yankees SB Record"/>

In 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was a nominee for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. In 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/lisn100.shtml|title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players|author=|accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |publisher=Baseball Almanac }}</ref>
Asked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, "There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything."  Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, "I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered."  Of his various records and achievements, Henderson values his career runs scored mark the most: "You have to score to win."<ref name=Manoloff />
