[[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] '''Claire Lee Chennault''' (September 6, 1893 <U+2013> July 27, 1958), was an American military [[aviator]]. A contentious officer, he was a fierce advocate of "pursuit" or fighter-interceptor aircraft during the 1930s when the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] was focused primarily on high-altitude bombardment. Chennault retired in 1937, went to work as an aviation trainer and adviser in China, and commanded the "[[Flying Tigers]]" during World War II, both the volunteer group and the uniformed units that replaced it in 1942. His family name is French{{#tag:ref|The family name is French. Claire Lee is a French-American by ancestry.

==Early life==
Claire Lee Chennault was born in [[Commerce, Texas]], to John Stonewall Jackson Chennault and Jessie (n<U+0117>e Lee) Chennault. He was reared in the [[Louisiana]] towns of [[Gilbert, Louisiana|Gilbert]] and [[Waterproof, Louisiana|Waterproof]]. He began misrepresenting his year of birth as 1890, possibly because he was too young to attend college after he graduated from high school, so his father added three years to his age.<ref>Hessen 1983, p. ix.</ref> The 1900 [[United States Census|US Census]] record from [[Franklin Parish]], LA, Ward 2 states that C. L. Chennault was six years of age in 1900, with a younger brother, aged three.<ref>"1900 US Census", Franklin Parish, Louisiana, p. 5A.</ref>)

==Military career==
Chennault attended [[Louisiana State University]] between 1909 and 1910 and received [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] training. At the onset of World War I, he graduated from Officer's School at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]], and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the [[Army Signal Corps#World War I|Army Signal Corps]].<ref>[http://lov.vac.gov.tw/OverSeas/eng/Content.aspx?Para=67&Control=1 "Claire Lee Chennault and the Flying Tigers."] ''vac.gov.tw''. Retrieved: November 28, 2009.</ref> He learned to fly in the [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]] during World War I, graduated from pursuit pilot training at [[Ellington International Airport (Texas)|Ellington Field, Texas]], on April 23, 1922, and remained in the service after it became the [[United States Army Air Corps|Air Corps]] in 1926. Chennault became Chief of Pursuit Section at [[Air Corps Tactical School]] in the 1930s.

===Leadership===
Into the mid 1930s Chennault led and represented the 1st Pursuit Group of the Montgomery, Alabama-based Army Air Corps [[Aerobatics|aerobatic team]] the "Three Musketeers".<ref>Owen, Stephen. ''The Flying Key Brothers and Their Flight To Remember.'' Spartanburg, South Carolina: Southeastern Printing, 1985. ISBN 0-9614830-0-8.</ref> The group performed at the 1928 National Air Races. In 1932, as a pursuit aviation instructor at [[Maxwell Air Force Base|Maxwell Field]], Chennault re-organized the team as "Three Men on the Flying Trapeze".

===Resignation===
Poor health and disputes with superiors led Chennault to resign from the service on April 30, 1937, leaving with the rank of captain. He then went to China and joined a small group of American civilians training Chinese airmen. When the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937<U+2013>1945)]] broke out in July, he served as "air adviser" to [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) Nationalist Government leader Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], working through the generalissimo's wife, [[Soong May-ling]] (who spoke excellent English). Chennault participated in planning operations, observed the Chinese Air Force in combat from a [[Curtiss Aircraft|Curtiss]] [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Hawk 75]], and helped organize the so-called "International Squadron" of foreign mercenary aviators. However, as Soviet air units increasingly flowed into China from the beginning of 1938, Chennault was sent to [[Kunming]] to head up a new training effort.

===Creation of the Flying Tigers===

[[File:LA Memorial P40.jpg|thumb|[[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] "Joy" at the USS Kidd Louisiana Veterans Memorial & Museum in Baton Rouge]]
Chennault arrived in China on June 1937. He had a three-month contract at a salary of $1,000 per month, charged with making a survey of the Chinese Air Force. [[Soong May-ling]], or "Madame Chiang" as she was known to Americans, was in charge of the Aeronautical Commission and thus became Chennault's immediate supervisor. Upon the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War that August, Chennault became Chiang Kai-shek's chief air adviser, helping to train Chinese Air Force bomber and fighter pilots, sometimes flying scouting missions in an export Curtiss H-75 fighter, and organizing the "International Squadron" of mercenary pilots.

Increasingly, however, Soviet bomber and fighter squadrons took over from China's battered units, and in the summer of 1938 Chennault went to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province in Western China, to train a new Chinese Air Force from an American mold.<ref>Xu, Guangqiu.

On October 21, 1939, Chennault boarded Pan American Airways "California Clipper" ([[Boeing 314#Variants|Boeing B-314]]; [[Boeing 314#Operators|NC18602]]) at the Pan American Airways terminal in Hong Kong. Chennault was on a special mission for Chiang Kai-shek. The California Clipper made a number of stops in the Pacific that included [[Manila]] (October 21) and [[Honolulu]], [[Territory of Hawaii]] (October 25), eventually arriving at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], San Francisco CA (October 26). Traveling with Chennault were four Chinese government officials: Mr. Shiao-down Chiang, Mr. Liu Yu-Wan, Mr. Tuan-Sheng Chien, and Mr. Ken-Sen Chow. Three of the passengers listed their place of origination as Kunming China, and Mr. Chow as Kaiting China.<ref>"California Passenger and Crew Lists, 1893<U+2013>1957." ''Passenger List, B.O. No. 39637/1, Sheet No. 1'', U.S. Immigration Officer Mr. E. C. Benson <U+2013> Inspector In Charge at Treasure Island.</ref>

By 1940, seeing that the Chinese Air Force had collapsed, because of ill-trained Chinese pilots and shortage of equipment, Chiang Kai-shek sent Chennault to the United States to meet with Dr. [[T. V. Soong]] in Washington DC, with the following directed purpose: ''to get as many fighter planes, bombers, and transports as possible, plus all the supplies needed to maintain them and the pilots to fly the aircraft''. With Chennault, the Chinese President ordered Chinese Air Force General Pang-Tsu Mow to assist Chennault at the Chinese Embassy in Washington DC. Together, they departed on Tuesday, October 15, 1940, from Chungking ([[Chongqing]]), China, arriving at the Port of Hong Kong where they boarded ''American Clipper'' (Boeing B-314, Pan American Airlines No. NC 18606, Captain J. Chase), on Friday, November 1, 1940; arriving Port of San Francisco at Treasure Island, on Thursday, November 14, 1940. They reported to the Chinese Ambassador to the United States [[Hu Shih]] on a mission that would ultimately conclude negotiations for the creation of an ''American Volunteer Group'' of pilots and mechanics to serve in China.{{#tag:ref|Records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, RG 85; National Archives, Washington, D.C.

This mission was focused on establishing bank loans between the U.S. government and the Bank of China. Traveling with Dr. Soong were three other Chinese government bank officials: Chu-Chen Lee, Fu-Chen Chang, Chien-Hung Chang. By late July 1940, Dr. Soong was able to obtain concessions from the U.S. government for two $50 million loans (to stabilize Chinese financial market; to purchase war material). On Friday, April 25, 1941, the United States and China formally signed a $50 million stabilization agreement to support the Chinese currency. Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau signed for the United States, and Dr. T. V. Soong and Dr. Lee Kan both signed for the Chinese government with the Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih present.

By Monday afternoon, December 23, upon approval by the War Department, State Department and the President of the United States, an agreement was reached to provide China the 100 P-40B Tomahawk aircraft<ref>"AVG fighter aircraft came from a Curtiss assembly line producing Tomahawk IIB models for the Royal Air Force in North Africa. The Tomahawk IIB was similar to the U.S. Army's earlier P-40B model, and there is some evidence that Curtiss actually used leftover components from that model in building the fighters intended for China. The fighters were purchased without "government-furnished equipment" such as reflector gunsights, radios and wing guns; the lack of these items caused continual difficulties for the AVG in Burma and China."</ref> The 100 P-40 aircraft were crated and sent to Burma on third country freighters during spring 1941. At Rangoon, they were unloaded, assembled and test flown by personnel of Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO) before being delivered to the AVG training unit at Toungoo.[10] One crate was dropped into the water and a wing assembly was ruined by salt water immersion, so CAMCO was able to deliver only 99 Tomahawks before war broke out. (Many of those were destroyed in training accidents.) The 100th fuselage was trucked to a CAMCO plant in Loiwing, China, and later made whole with parts from damaged aircraft. Shortages in equipment with spare parts almost impossible to obtain in Burma along with the slow introduction of replacement fighter aircraft were continual impediments although the AVG did receive 50 replacement P-40E fighters from USAAF stocks that were originally scheduled for shipment to Great Britain but cancelled due to the Tomahawk's inferior flight performance against German fighters.{{#tag:ref|The P-40 Allison engine's single-stage supercharger produced its optimum performance at just 15,000-ft- far below the operational ceilings of contemporary European fighters, which used two-stage superchargers.|group=N}} With an agreement reached, General Pang-Tsu Mow returned to China aboard [[SS Lurline (1932)|SS ''Lurline'']]; departing from Los Angeles on January 24, 1941. Chennault followed shortly after with a promise from the War Department and President Roosevelt to be delivered to Chiang Kai-shek that several shipments of P-40C fighters were forthcoming along with pilots, mechanics, and aviation supplies. And, Dr. Soong began negotiations for an increase in financial aid with U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Federal Loan Administrator [[Jesse H. Jones]] on Thursday, October 17, 1940.{{#tag:ref| It was stated in this UP news article that during the past seven years the United States had loaned China about $85 million.<ref>"U.S. Considers Help To China.

President Roosevelt then sent [[Curtiss P-40]] Tomahawks to the Chinese under the American [[Lend-Lease]] program. Chennault also was able to recruit some 300 American pilots and ground crew, posing as tourists, who were adventurers or mercenaries, not necessarily idealists out to save China. But under Chennault they developed into a crack fighting unit, always going against superior Japanese forces. They became the symbol of America's military might in Asia.<ref>Sehnert, Walt.

Just weeks after the Japanese air [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] (Sunday morning, December 7, 1941), the first news reports released to the public pertaining to Claire Chennault's war exploits occurred on December 20, 1941 when senior Chinese officials in Chungking that Saturday evening released his name to [[United Press International]] reporters to commemorate the first aerial attack made by the international air force called the [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG).<ref>"Burma Road Air Defense Scores."

Based primarily out of [[Rangoon]], Burma and [[Kunming]], Yunnan, Chennault's 1st [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG) <U+2013> better known as the "[[Flying Tigers]]" <U+2013> began training in August 1941 and fought the Japanese for seven months after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Chennault's three squadrons used P-40s, and his tactics of "defensive pursuit," formulated in the years when bombers were actually faster than intercepting fighter planes, to guard the [[Burma]] Road, [[Rangoon]], and other strategic locations in Southeast Asia and western China against Japanese forces. As the commander of the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] flight training school at Yunnan-yi, west of Kunming, Chennault also made a great contribution by training a new generation Chinese fighter pilots.

The Flying Tigers were formally incorporated into the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in 1942. Prior to that, Chennault had rejoined the Army with the rank of [[colonel]]. He was later promoted to [[brigadier general]] and then [[major general]], commanding the [[Fourteenth Air Force]].

The first magazine photo coverage of Claire Chennault took place within Life magazine in the Monday, August 10, 1942, issue.

===China-Burma-India theater===
Throughout the war Chennault was engaged in a bitter dispute with the American ground commander, General [[Joseph Stilwell]]. Chennault believed that the Fourteenth Air Force, operating out of bases in China, could attack Japanese forces in concert with Nationalist Chinese troops.  For his part, Stilwell wanted air assets diverted to his command to support the opening of a ground supply route through northern Burma to China.  This route would provide supplies and new equipment for a greatly expanded Nationalist force of twenty to thirty modernized divisions.  Chiang Kai-shek favored Chennault's plans, since he was suspicious of British colonial interests in Burma and was not prepared to begin major offensive operations against the Japanese. He was also concerned about alliances with semi-independent generals supporting the Nationalist government, and was concerned that a major loss of military forces would enable his Communist Chinese adversaries to gain the upper hand.

Good weather in November 1943 found the Japanese Army air forces ready to challenge Allied forces again, and they began night and day raids on Calcutta and the Hump bases while their fighters contested Allied air intrusions over Burma. In 1944, Japanese ground forces advanced and seized Chennault's forward bases.  Slowly, however, the greater numbers and greater skill of the Allied air forces began to assert themselves.  By mid-1944, Major General [[George E. Stratemeyer]]'s [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Eastern Air Command]] dominated the skies over Burma; this superiority was never to be relinquished. At the same time, logistical support reaching India and China via [[the Hump]] finally reached levels permitting an Allied offensive into northern Burma.

Chennault had long argued for expansion of the airlift, doubting that any ground supply network through Burma could provide the tonnage needed to re-equip Chiang's divisions.  However, work on the [[Ledo Road]] overland route continued throughout 1944 and was completed in January 1945. Training of the new Chinese divisions commenced; however, predictions of monthly tonnage (65,000 per month) over the road were never achieved. By the time Nationalist armies began to receive large amounts of supplies via the Ledo Road, the war had ended.  Instead, the airlift continued to expand until the end of the war, after delivering 650,000 tons of supplies, gasoline, and military equipment.

==Postwar==
[[File:Chennaut and wife.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Chennault and second wife [[Chen Xiangmei]]]]
Chennault, who, unlike [[Joseph Stilwell]], had a high opinion of [[Chiang Kai-shek]], advocated international support for Asian [[anti-communist]] movements. Returning to China, he purchased several surplus military aircraft and created the [[Civil Air Transport]], (later known as [[Air America (airline)|Air America]]).<ref name="Smith 1995">Smith 1995</ref>  These aircraft facilitated aid to [[Nationalist China]] during the struggle against [[Chinese Communists]] in the late 1940s, and were later used in supply missions to French forces in [[Indochina]]<ref name="Smith 1995"/> and the [[Kuomintang]] occupation of Northern [[Burma]] throughout the mid- and late-1950s, providing support for the [[Thai police]] force. This same force supplied the [[intelligence community]] and others during the Vietnam conflict.

In 1951, a now-retired [[Major General]] Chennault testified and provided written statements to the Senate Joint Committee on [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Forces]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations]], which was investigating the causes of the fall of China in 1949 to Communist forces.  Together with Army General [[Albert C. Wedemeyer]], Navy [[Vice Admiral]] [[Oscar C. Badger II]], and others, Chennault stated that the [[Truman administration]]'s arms embargo was a key factor in the loss of [[morale]] to the Nationalist armies.<ref>Chennault, Claire Lee (Major-General, retired). ''Testimony to the Senate Joint Committee on the Armed Forces and Foreign Relations'', letter dated June 20, 1951, and supplemental statement, Appendix 00, p. 3342.</ref>

Chennault advocated changes in the way foreign aid was distributed, encouraged the [[U.S. Congress]] to focus on individualized aid assistance with specific goals, with close monitoring by U.S. advisers.  This viewpoint may have reflected his experiences during the [[Chinese Civil War]], where officials of the [[Kuomintang]] and semi-independent army officers diverted aid intended for the Nationalist armies.  Shortly before his death, Chennault was asked to testify before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] of the Congress. When a committee member asked him who won the [[Korean War]], his response was blunt: "The Communists."
