The station is on the eastern edge of [[Barkingside]] in the [[London Borough of Redbridge]], at the end of a cul-de-sac called Station Road.<ref name=maps>{{cite web |website=Google Maps |title=Barkingside Tube Station |accessdate=14 March 2015 |url=https://www.google.com.my/maps/place/Barkingside/@51.58525,0.088551,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d8a6a6814fc587:0xddb77a7af1794cd5}}</ref> The station is next door to the home of [[Barkingside F.C.]]<ref name=maps/>

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
The station originally opened on 1 May 1903, as part of a [[Great Eastern Railway]] (GER) branch line from [[Woodford, London|Woodford]] to [[Ilford]] via [[Hainault, London|Hainault]].<ref name=culgcentral>{{cite web |url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/central.html |title=Central line |work=Clive's Underground Line Guides |last=Feather |first=Clive |accessdate=2 May 2015 |archivedate=2 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150502153731/http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/central.html}}</ref> This "[[Fairlop Loop]]", designed to stimulate suburban growth had a chequered history and Barkingside station was temporarily closed to passenger traffic, due to World War I economies, from 21 May 1916 until 30 June 1919.<ref name=culgcentral /> As a consequence of the 1921 [[Railways Act 1921|Railways Act]], the GER was merged with other railway companies in 1923 to become part of the [[London & North Eastern Railway]] (LNER).
[[File:Barkingside Station 1760038 faab3cfb.jpg|thumb|left|The station in 1961]]
As part of the 1935 - 1940 "New Works Programme" of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] the majority of the loop was to be transferred to form the eastern extensions of the Central line.<ref name=culgcentral /> Although work commenced in 1938 it was suspended upon the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939 and work only recommenced in 1946.<ref name=culgcentral /> Steam train services serving Barkingside were suspended on 29 November 1947 and electrified Central line passenger services, to Central London via [[Gants Hill tube station|Gants Hill]], finally commenced on 31 May 1948.<ref name=culgcentral /> The line from [[Newbury Park tube station|Newbury Park]] to [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] through Barkingside had been electrified for empty train movements to the new depot at Hainault from 14 December 1947.

The station contains two platforms, one for each direction.<ref name=culgcentral />

Few alterations took place to the station upon transfer to the Underground. Barkingside station is a "Grade II" [[listed building]], marking it as a structure of architectural significance.<ref name="eh_1081012" /> Probably designed under the direction of W. N. Ashbee, the GER architect, it is dominated by a substantial brick building, surmounted by a cupola.<ref name="eh_1081012" /> The interior is notable for the fine [[hammerbeam roof]] to the ticket hall. Both platforms retain the ornate canopies with the "GER" initials still visible in the bracketry.
