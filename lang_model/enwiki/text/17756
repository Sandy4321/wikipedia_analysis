'''R<U+00E9>union''' ([[French language|French]]: ''La R<U+00E9>union'') is an island and overseas ''[[d<U+00E9>partement]]'' (''[[d<U+00E9>partement d'outre-mer]]'', or ''DOM'') of [[France]], located in the [[Indian Ocean]] east of [[Madagascar]], about 200 [[kilometre|km]] southwest of [[Mauritius]]. Like the other DOMs, R<U+00E9>union is also one of the 26 ''[[R<U+00E9>gion in France|r<U+00E9>gion]]s'' of France with the same status as those situated on the [[Metropolitan France|European mainland]]. As part of France, R<U+00E9>union is part of the [[European Union]], and thus the currency used is the [[euro]] (in fact, due to varying time zones in the European Union, R<U+00E9>union was the first region in the world to use the euro, and the first ever purchase using the euro occurred at 12.01 a.m., when regional council president Paul Verg<U+00E9>s bought a bag of lychees at a Saint-Denis market).

== History ==
Arab sailors used to call this island ''Dina Morgabin'' ("Western Island"). The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first Europeans to visit the island, finding it uninhabited in [[1513]], and naming it ''Santa Apollonia''.

The island was then occupied by the [[France|French]] and administered from Port-Louis, Mauritius. Although the French flag was hoisted by Fran<U+00E7>ois Cauche in [[1638]], Santa Apollonia was officially claimed by Jacques Pronis of France in [[1642]], when he deported a dozen French mutineers to the island from [[Madagascar]]. The convicts were returned to [[France]] several years later, and in [[1649]], the King of France [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] named the island ''<U+00CE>le Bourbon'' after his royal house.

"R<U+00E9>union" was the name given to the island in [[1793]] by a decree of the Convention with the fall of the [[House of Bourbon]] in France, and the name commemorates the union of revolutionaries from [[Marseille]] with the [[French National Guard|National Guard]] in [[Paris]], which took place on [[August 10]], [[1792]]. In [[1801]], the island was renamed "<U+00CE>le Bonaparte," after [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The island was taken by the [[United Kingdom|British]] navy led by [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]] in [[1810]], who used the old name of "Bourbon." When it was restored to France by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in [[1815]], the island retained the name of "Bourbon" until [[1848]], when the fall of the restored Bourbons during [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|the revolutions during that year]] meant that the island became "R<U+00E9>union" once again. 

From the 17th to the 19th centuries, French immigration supplemented by influxes of Africans, Chinese, [[Malay people|Malays]], and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] (Malabar) Indians gave the island its ethnic mix. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 cost the island its importance as a stopover on the [[East Indies]] trade route.

R<U+00E9>union became an overseas ''[[d<U+00E9>partement]]'' of [[France]] on [[March 19]], [[1946]].

Between 15 and [[16 March]] [[1952]], Cilaos at the center of R<U+00E9>union received 1,869.9 mm (73.6 in) of rainfall. This is the greatest 24-hour precipitation total ever recorded on Earth.

In 2005 and 2006 R<U+00E9>union was hit by a crippling epidemic of [[chikungunya]], a disease spread by mosquitos.  According to the BBC News[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4674376.stm], 255,000 people on R<U+00E9>union had contracted the disease as of 26 April, 2006.  The disease also spread to Madagascar[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4777530.stm] and to mainland France through airline travel.  The disease led to more than 200 deaths on R<U+00E9>union.  The French government, under Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] sent an emergency aid package worth 36 million euro ($42.8 U.S. dollars) and deployed approximately 500 French troops to eradicate mosquitos.

[[Chikungunya]] means "that which bends" in the Makonde language of the Tanzania/ Mozambique border region where it was first identified.  It can cause dehydration, extreme pain and high fevers and can be fatal in some cases.  There is no known cure for the illness.

==Politics==
''Main article: [[Politics of R<U+00E9>union]]''

Administratively, R<U+00E9>union is divided into 4 [[arrondissement in France|arrondissement]]s, 24 [[commune in France|commune]]s, and 47 cantons. It is a French overseas department as well as a French region. The low number of communes, compared to French metropolitan department of similar size and population, is an originality; most R<U+00E9>unionnese communes encompass several localities, sometimes separated by significant distances. R<U+00E9>union is part of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]].

== Geography ==
''Main article: [[Geography of R<U+00E9>union]]''

[[Image:Reunion_21.12S_55.51E.jpg|thumb|250px|View from satellite]]

The [[island]] is 39 [[mile]]s (63 [[kilometer]]s) long, is 28 miles (45 kilometers) wide, and covers 970 [[square mile]]s (2512 [[square kilometre]]s). The island is similar to the big island of [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] because both are located above [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]s in the Earth's crust.

''[[Piton de la Fournaise]]'', a [[shield volcano]] on the eastern end of R<U+00E9>union Island, rises more than 8565 feet (2611 meters) above sea level and is sometimes called a sister to Hawaiian volcanoes because of the similarity of climate and volcanic nature, has erupted more than 100 times since 1640 and is under constant monitoring. It most recently erupted on [[July 20]], [[2006]]. La Fournaise is created by a hot spot volcano, which also created the [[Piton des Neiges]] and the islands of [[Mauritius]] and [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]].

''[[Piton des Neiges]]'' volcano, the highest point on the island at 10069 feet (3070 meters) above sea level, is northwest of ''Piton de la Fournaise'' volcano. Collapsed calderas and canyons are southwest of the mountain. Like [[Mauna Kea]] on the [[big island of Hawaii]], ''Piton des Neiges'' is extinct. Despite its name, [[snow]] practically never falls on the summit.

The slopes of both volcanoes are heavily forested. Cultivated land and cities like the capital city of [[Saint-Denis, R<U+00E9>union|Saint-Denis]] are concentrated on the surrounding coastal lowlands.

R<U+00E9>union also has three [[caldera]]s: the [[Cirque de Salazie]], the [[Cilaos|Cirque de Cilaos]] and the [[Cirque de Mafate]]. The latter is accessible only by foot or helicopter.

== Economy ==
''Main article: [[Economy of R<U+00E9>union]]''

[[Sugar]] is the chief agricultural product and export, and [[tourism]] is also an important source of income.

The territory traditionally had a large gap in income and standard of living between the wealthier communities of European and Indian descent, and the poorer African and other communities. This gap is closing with time. Metropolitan France provides substantial financial support to R<U+00E9>union.

Some fishermen of R<U+00E9>union also derive a certain amount of revenue from [[shark]] fishing.

== Demographics ==
''Main article: [[Demographics of R<U+00E9>union]]''

Reunion contains most of the same ethnic populations as [[Mauritius]] - [[Malabars]] or [[Tamil people|Tamil]], [[Indian subcontinent|Indians]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[African]], [[Malagasy]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and ethnic [[French people|French]] - but in different proportions. Creoles, of mixed origin, make up the majority. [[Whites]] make up approximately one-quarter of the population, Indians make up 21% and people of Chinese or Vietnamese ancestry most of the remainder.

The predominant religion is [[Roman Catholicism]] (86% of the population in 1995), with [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]] also represented.

== Public health ==

Reunion is currently experiencing an epidemic of [[Chikungunya]] virus. As of [[April 6]] [[2006]], 230,000 people have been infected, which amounts to 29% of the population.

== Culture ==
''Main article: [[Culture of R<U+00E9>union]]''

''See also: [[Music of R<U+00E9>union]]''

Reunionese culture is a blend of [[European]], [[African]], [[Indian people|Indian]], [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] and insular traditions.

The most widely spoken language, [[R<U+00E9>union Creole]], derives from French, with many idiosyncracies. R<U+00E9>union Creole is now taught in some schools. However, an official orthography has yet to be agreed upon.

Local food and music blend influences from Africa, India, China and Europe.

== A flag for R<U+00E9>union? ==
Although the federal period installed a number of flags of metropolitan France, R<U+00E9>union does not have a separate official flag. 

One flag was selected by the French association of [[Vexillology|vexillologists]] in [[2003]]. It depicts the [[volcano]] of [[Fournaise]], bedecked by gold sunbeams. It symbolises the appearance of populations who converged on the island at the turn of the century.

Another flag is [[Commons:Image:Flag of R<U+00E9>union (Local).svg|Proposed flag for R<U+00E9>union]]
