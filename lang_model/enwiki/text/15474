Lavigne's mother was the first to spot young Lavigne<U+2019>s talent. At the age of two, Lavigne began singing along with her mother on church songs. The family moved to [[Napanee]], [[Ontario]], when Lavigne was five years old.

In 1998, Avril Lavigne won a competition to sing with fellow Canadian singer [[Shania Twain]] on her first major concert tour. She appeared alongside Twain at her concert in [[Ottawa]], appearing on stage to sing "[[What Made You Say That]]".

She was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing [[country music|country]] covers at a [[Chapters]] bookstore in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]].<ref name="unofficialbiog"/>  During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folk singer Steve Medd (a relation of the influential Canadian journalist, Ben Medd), who invited her to sing on his song "Touch the Sky" for his 1999 album ''Quinte Spirit''. She also sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow up album, ''My Window to You'', in 2000.<ref name="unofficialbiog"/>

At the age of sixteen she was signed by Ken Krongard, the [[A&R|artists-and-repertoire (A&R)]] representative of [[Arista Records]], who invited the head of Arista, [[Antonio Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]], to hear her sing at the [[New York City]] studio of producer Peter Zizzo.<ref name="unofficialbiog"/> She then completed work on her first album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]''. [[The Matrix (music producer)|The Matrix]], who worked extensively with Lavigne on the album, commented on her songwriting, saying, "We conceived the ideas on guitar and piano.

On [[May 25]] [[2007]], Lavigne, her co-songwriter [[Lukasz Gottwald]], and her record label were sued by songwriters James Gangwer and Tommy Dunbar over claims that her song "Girlfriend" infringes on their 1979 song "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", originally performed by [[The Rubinoos]].<ref>Apple Insider, [http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/07/03/apple_sued_for_duping_apple_tv_image_hosting_itunes_track.html]</ref> In June 2007, Canadian singer-songwriter [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], with whom Lavigne wrote the majority of her second album, ''Under My Skin'', spoke to ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine about Lavigne's songwriting, saying, "I mean, Avril, songwriter? Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything. Avril will also cross the ethical line and no one says anything. That's why I'll never work with her again. I sent her a song two years ago called 'Contagious', and I just saw the tracklisting to this album and there's a song called 'Contagious' on it<U+2014>and my name's not on it. What do you do with that? See, I won't [call the lawyers], I'll just tell you. Art should not be subject to that kind of controversy."<ref>''Performing Songwriter Magazine'', June 2007 [http://www.performingsongwriter.com/vault/tech/features/keyboard_102.pdf]</ref> On July 6, Lavigne denied both accusations in an open letter on her website, claiming that she had "never heard the [Rubinoos] song in [her] life" and also that she is considering taking legal action against Kreviazuk with regards to her allegations, which she considers "damaging to my reputation and a clear defamation of my character".<ref name="lavignereply">{{Cite web|url = http://www.avrillavigne.com/node/7175 | title = To My Dear Media, Friends, and Fans  | accessdate = 2007-07-07 | publisher = Avril Lavigne | year = 2007 | author = Lavigne, Avril}}</ref> On July 10, Kreviazuk made a full public apology and retracted the statements made in the aforementioned interview.<ref name="kreviazukstatement">{{Cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003609349 | title = Kreviazuk Retracts Lavigne Songwriting Comments  | accessdate = 2007-07-12 | publisher = Billboard.com | year = 2007 | author = LeBlanc, Larry}}</ref>

==Film career==
Lavigne made her film debut in the animated film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', which is based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of same name]]. She worked alongside [[William Shatner]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Garry Shandling]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Steve Carell]]. She is also acting in the [[Richard Gere]] film ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]'',<ref>[http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/051202d.php ''The Flock'']</ref> as the girlfriend of a crime suspect, and her third project was ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on her favorite book.

*'''Music Genre'''
In Lavigne's official MySpace page, she affirms that her music genre is Pop/Punk/Rock;<ref>[http://img58.imageshack.us/img58/7985/avril001cl6.jpg]</ref> but [[All Music Guide]] and other reviewers consider her "Punk, Punk-pop, Pop/Rock, Alternative Rock, Alternative Pop-Rock, Modern Rock and Post-Grunge". The reason for the confusion appears to be for her punk-like appearance early in her career, however, she has frequently stated that she's "not punk."<ref>[http://theedge.bostonherald.com/musicNews/view.bg?articleid=28709&format= ''Boston Herald'' Music News]</ref> Lavigne cites many early punk bands and figures as influences (most notably [[Sid Vicious]]), her music has little in common with 1970s punk. 

*'''Others'''
Lavigne spoke about her new look in a September 2006 interview. She explains, "When I was in high school I was a little shit, hanging out with the guys, getting drunk, getting in fights, playing hockey. My band were all guys, so I was only around guys, but when I got older I started being more of a chick. I broke out on the scene looking like the 17-year-old that I was. And from then to now I look really different<U+2014>but that's called growing up."<ref>[http://www.postchronicle.com/news/entertainment/tittletattle/article_21237642.shtml Lavigne's glamorous new look]</ref>

Also in a recent interview, she said she prefers not to eat meat, but will not say she's a vegetarian "in case anyone caught her eating meat".<ref>January 2003<U+2014>Seventeen Magazine</ref> 

As a teenager she would hang out at the La Pizzeria restaurant in [[Napanee, Ontario]]. In her ''Under My Skin Bonez Documentary'', she has stated that pizza with olive toppings is her favourite food, although she doesn't eat it too much because pizza is detrimental to her voice. Since her rise to fame, the restaurant has named a pizza after Lavigne that contains her favourite toppings and there is a guest book for fans to sign that Lavigne picks up when she visits friends and family in her home town.<ref>[http://avrillavigne.bloggergirl.com/2005/09/interview-with-avrils-pizza-boi.html Home town pizza restaurant names pizza after Avril]</ref>

Lavigne has a star [[tattoo]]ed on the inside of her left wrist that matches the style of the one used for her first album artwork. It was created at the same time as friend and musical associate [[Ben Moody]]'s identical tattoo. In late 2004, she had a small pink heart-shaped tattoo featuring the letter 'D' applied to her right wrist<U+2014>thought to be a reference to husband [[Deryck Whibley]], with whom she has bought a house in [[Bel-Air]], previously owned by another famous couple: [[Travis Barker]] and [[Shanna Moakler]] for $9.5 Million. The house has 8 bedrooms, 10.5 bathrooms, an office, elevator, a high-tech kitchen and a 10-car garage.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20034146,00.html Avril Lavigne Buys 10-Bathroom Mansion] ''People.com'' Retrieved on 05-15-07 </ref>

Lavigne was romantically linked to her former guitarist [[Jesse Colburn]], but despite rumors{{Fact|date=June 2007}}, she did not have a relationship with another former guitarist, [[Evan Taubenfeld]]. However, Taubenfeld still considers Lavigne his "dearest friend in the whole world" as said on a recent Q&A on his band's official website. In a ''J-14'' magazine from 2004, she talks about her first kiss being when she was fourteen years old.{{citequote}}

In 2004, reports emerged that [[Hilary Duff]] and Lavigne were fighting. "I read that I was supposedly mad at my fans for dressing like me", [[Newsweek]] quoted Lavigne as saying. "They quoted Hilary Duff saying, 'Avril needs to appreciate her fans more and blah, blah, blah.' I'm like, excuse me? First off, it's not even true. I never said that. And second, who the hell cares what she has to say about my fans? Whatever. Hilary Duff's such a goody-goody, such a mommy's girl." Recently, there were reports of drama between the two at a Maxim party in New York - with a complication in arrival times causing an unwanted run-in. Lavigne was said to be furious, pacing around and pressuring her company to leave.
