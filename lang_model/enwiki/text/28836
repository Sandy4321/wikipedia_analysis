Serving from January 1997 to January 2007, he was the [[List of the first LGBT holders of political offices|first-ever openly gay]] member of the [[Illinois General Assembly]] and was also [[HIV-positive]].<ref name=tribune>{{cite web |url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2008/05/first-openly-ga.html |title=First openly gay Illinois lawmaker dies |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref>

Rod Blagojevich]] and [[Howard Dean]], chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]].<ref name=wct2>{{cite web |url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=18338 |title=Larry McKeon passes; memorial in Springfield May 20 |work=[[Windy City Times]] |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref>

He held degrees from [[California State University at Los Angeles]] and completed some doctoral work at the [[University of Chicago]]. A veteran of the [[United States Army]], McKeon had been a lieutenant with the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] before moving to Chicago.<ref name=tribune2>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-16-may16,0,5932917.column |title=Gay officers out of closet thanks to him |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2008-05-16 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref>

McKeon was elected to the House in 1996 from a Chicago district then-numbered the 34<sup>th</sup> and was sworn in the following January. He served on the committees on Labor, Aging, and several other subjects. During the 2002 redistricting, his district became the 13<sup>th</sup>.

In July 2006, he announced his intention to retire from the legislature at the end of his term in January 2007. As he had already won the March 2006 Democratic primary election without opposition and thus had become the party's nominee for re-election, it fell to the five [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ward committeemen in his district to select a replacement nominee, who would run with no Republican opponent in the November 2006 general election. They selected the openly gay (and openly HIV-positive) [[Greg Harris (Illinois)|Greg Harris]].

Many of his campaigns won the backing of the [[Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund]].<ref name=vf>{{cite web |url=http://www.victoryfund.org/news/view/url:victory_fund_mourns_loss_of_larry_mckeon |title=Victory Fund mourns loss of Larry McKeon |work=[[Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund|Victory Fund]] |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref>

In 1991 his longtime partner, Ray Korzinski, was diagnosed with [[AIDS]], dying just 12 weeks later.<ref name=ap>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=190889&src=109 |title=Illinois first openly gay legislator dies |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-05-14 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}</ref>
