'''Farmland Industries''' was the largest [[agricultural cooperative]] in North America when it declared bankruptcy in 2002.

The Farmland brand and its slogan "Good Food From the Heartland" is now owned by [[Smithfield Foods]] which continues to market meat products under the Farmland brand.
==History==
[[File:Farmland2.jpg|thumb|300px|Farmland's former headquarters at 12200 N. Ambassador Drive by Kansas City International Airport in 2009]]
It was founded 1929 by [[Howard A. Cowden]] as the '''Union Oil Company''' (as a successor to Cowden Oil Company which he founded the year before). In 1935 it took the name '''Consumers Cooperative Association''' (CCA), and in 1966  '''Farmland Industries, Inc.'''

At its peak, the organization was the largest [[agricultural cooperative]] in North America, owned by 1,700 farm [[cooperative]]s in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which cooperatives were in turn owned by more than 600,000 farmer families.  It had 16,000 employees in all 50 states and 90 countries.  In 1977 it ranked #78 on the [[Fortune 100]] company list.<ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Farmland-Industries-Inc-Company-History.html Farmland Industries, Inc. - Company History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In 2001, its annual revenues were in excess of $11.8 billion.  It was listed as one of Fortune's "most admired" companies.  It ranked #170 on the Fortune List when it dissolved.

The cooperative provided both agricultural supply and marketing services ranging from petroleum refining, fertilizer manufacture, feeds, shipping, crop production, livestock production, and refrigerated foods sales and marketing.  The company was a joint venture partner with a number of other companies, including: [[Archer Daniels Midland]] in grain storage, distribution and marketing; [[Simplot]] in phosphate production; [[ConAgra]] in wheat marketing; [[Land O'Lakes]] in feed systems and crop nutrients; [[Cenex]] Harvest States in lubricants, propane and refined fuels; [[Mississippi Chemical]] in nitrogen production and shipping (Trinidad and Tobago); Norsk Hydro in phosphate fertilizer production and marketing; [[Wilbur Ellis]] Company in [[crop protection]] product marketing and distribution; [[U.S. Premium Beef]] in beef packing; and [[Kansas State University]] in agricultural research.  Farmland also owned Tradigrain, a group of international grain trading companies headquartered in [[Geneva, Switzerland]].         

The company operated on a cooperative basis.  The member/owners shared numerous commercial and financial benefits, including the sharing of costs for the processing and marketing of goods, competitive prices, and better supply and delivery capabilities.

==Bankruptcy==
The company loaded up on debt in the 1990s.

In June 1999 it broke ground for a {{convert|280000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} headquarters on a {{convert|40|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus<ref>[http://www.turnerconstruction.com/kansascity/content.asp?d=5188&p=5186 Turner Construction Company<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> just east of [[Kansas City International Airport]] to consolidate the offices for 1,000 employees.  The building was completed in 2001.<ref>[http://www.thinkkc.com/1_kcnews/1c_article_archives/1999/farmland_4q99.htm Farmland Industries Continues Extraordinary Growth in KC - thinkkc.com]</ref>
  
The cooperative entered [[Chapter 11]] [[bankruptcy]] in May 2002 after failing to secure a $500 million loan to meet lender demands on cash requirements (in its filing it listed $2.7 billion in assets and $1.9 billion in debt).

It was affected by a prolonged downturn in [[fertilizer]] prices, coupled with high energy prices and capital costs.  The reorganization process resulted in the sale of virtually all of the company's assets, including the following subsidiaries:  Farmland Foods, Inc., the pork processing division to [[Smithfield Foods]] for $367M; Farmland National Beef Packing Company to US Premium Beef for $232M; and the fertilizer production division to [[Koch Industries]]. 

The [[Co-op Retirement Plan]], which provides a final salary defined benefit [[retirement plan]] for member cooperatives' employees, was administered by Farmland. A non-profit, United Benefits Group, was incorporated to take over this service, from 2003.<ref>{{Cite web

The reorganization process resulted in the sale of the cooperative's assets, with all creditors repaid by 2006.  According to [[JPMorgan]], the liquidating trustee, unsecured creditors received $891&nbsp;million, which was 104&nbsp;cents on the dollar, the maximum allowed by law, and allows for interest.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[JPMorgan]]|url=http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/press/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=203015|title=JPMorgan Bankruptcy & Settlement Services Distributes Full Payment Of $891 Million To Farmland Unsecured Creditors|accessdate=2008-04-21|date=2006-06-28}}</ref>

Before the [[liquidation]] was completed, it was accepted that no assets remained to be distributed to the members, the local cooperatives, who had to write off the loss of their [[Ownership equity|equity account]] balances.  A 2004 study in Oklahoma suggested that the biggest impacts on cooperatives were on farmer relations and lost business relationships, and the direct financial impact of the write off was low.<ref>{{Cite web
