A '''quark star''' or '''strange star'''  is a hypothetical type of [[exotic star|Exotic]] [[star]] composed of [[quark matter]], or [[strange matter]]. These are ultra-dense [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s of [[degenerate matter]] theorized to form inside particularly massive [[neutron star]]s. 

It is theorized that when the [[neutron-degenerate matter]] which makes up a neutron star is put under sufficient pressure due to the star's [[gravity]], the individual [[neutron]]s break down into their constituent [[quark]]s, [[up quark]]s and [[down quark]]s. Some of these quarks may then become [[strange quarks]] and form strange matter. The star then becomes known as a "quark star" or "strange star", similar to a single gigantic [[hadron]] (but bound by gravity rather than the [[strong interaction|color force]]). Quark matter/strange matter is one candidate for the theoretical [[dark matter]] that is a feature of several [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] theories. 

==Quark star==
A quark star may be formed from a neutron star through a process called [[quark]] [[deconfinement]]. This process may produce a [[quark nova]]. The resultant star should have free quarks in its interior. The deconfinement process should release immense amounts of energy, perhaps being the most energetic explosions in existence. It may be that [[gamma ray bursts]] are indeed quark-novae. A quark star lies between neutron stars and [[black hole]]s in terms of both mass and density, and if sufficient additional matter is added to a quark star, it will collapse into a black hole.

Neutron stars with masses of 1.5<U+2013>1.8 solar masses with rapid spin are theoretically the best candidates for conversion. This amounts to 1% of the projected neutron star population. An extrapolation based on this indicates that up to 2 quark-novae may occur in the observable universe each day.

Theoretically quark stars may be radio quiet, so [[radio-quiet neutron stars]] may be quark stars.

==Strange star==
Recent theoretical research has found mechanisms by which quark stars with "strange quark nuggets" may decrease the objects' electric fields and densities from previous theoretical expectations, causing such stars to appear very much like<U+2014>nearly indistinguishable from<U+2014>neutron stars ([http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0507055 Jaikumar et al. 2006]). However, the team made some fundamental assumptions that led to uncertainties in their theory large enough that the case for it is not yet solid. More research, both observational and theoretical, remains to be done on strange stars in the future. 

Other theoretical work [http://news-info.wustl.edu/tips/page/normal/8380.html], published in the [[Physical Review]] D 73, 114016 ([[2006]]), contends that, "A sharp interface between quark matter and the vacuum would have very different properties from the surface of a neutron star"; and, addressing key parameters like [[surface tension]] and [[electric force|electrical forces]] that were neglected in the original study, the results show that as long as the surface tension is below a low critical value, the large [[strangelet]]s are indeed unstable to fragmentation and strange stars naturally come with complex strangelet crusts, analogous to those of neutron stars.

==Other theorized quark formations==
Other formations of quark stars are as the following:
* Jaffe 1977, suggested a four-quark state with strangeness (qs<FONT style="text-decoration: overline;">qs</FONT>).
* H-dibaryon, a six-quark state with equal numbers of up-, down-, and strange quarks (uuddss).
* Bound multi-quark systems with heavy quarks (QQ<FONT style="text-decoration: overline;">qq</FONT>).
* In 1987, a [[pentaquark]] state was first proposed with a charm anti-quark (qqqs<FONT style="text-decoration: overline;">c</FONT>).
* Pentaquark state with an antistrange quark & four light quarks consisting of up- and down-quarks only (qqqq<FONT style="text-decoration: overline;">s</FONT>).
* Light pentaquarks are grouped within an antidecuplet, the lightest candidate, <U+04E8>+.
** This can also be described by the diquark model of Jaffe and Wilczek (QCD).
* <U+04E8>++ & antiparticle <FONT style="text-decoration: overline;"><U+04E8></FONT>--.
* Doubly strange pentaquark (sssdd<FONT style="text-decoration: overline;">u</FONT>), member of the light pentaquark antidecuplet.
* Charmed pentaquark <U+04E8>c(3100) (uudd<FONT style="text-decoration: overline;">c</FONT>) state was detected by the H1 collaboration.

==Observed overdense neutron stars==
Quark stars and strange stars are largely theoretical at this point, but observations released by the [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] on [[April 10]] [[2002]] detected two candidates, designated [[RX J1856.5-3754]] and [[3C58]], which had previously been thought to be neutron stars. Based on the known laws of physics, the former appeared much smaller and the latter much colder than it should be, suggesting that they are composed of material denser than [[neutronium]]. However, these observations have been under attack by researchers who say the results were not conclusive; it remains to be seen how the question of quark star or strange star existence will play out.
Recently a third star, [[XTE J1739-285]] <ref>http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn11221?DCMP=NLC-nletter&nsref=dn11221</ref>, has been observed by a team led by Philip Kaaret of the University of Iowa, and also reported as a possible candidate.
