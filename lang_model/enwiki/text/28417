"'''We Are the World 25 for Haiti'''" is a 2010 song and [[charity single]] recorded by the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] Artists for Haiti. It is a remake of the 1985 hit song "[[We Are the World]]", which was written by American musicians [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lionel Richie]], and was recorded by [[USA for Africa]] to benefit famine relief in Africa. Initially, in late 2009, it had been suggested to Richie and [[Quincy Jones]]<U+2014>producer of the original "We Are the World"<U+2014>that a re-cut version of the song be re-released under the title "Live 25". Following the [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude 7.0 M<sub>w</sub>]] [[2010 Haiti earthquake|earthquake]] in [[Haiti]], which devastated the area and killed hundreds of thousands of people, it was agreed that the song would be re-recorded by new artists, in the hope that it would reach a new generation and help benefit the people of Haiti.

The song was recorded in fourteen hours by over eighty artists on February 1, and was released on February 12, 2010, during the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics]]. "We Are the World 25 for Haiti" was released as a CD single and a music download. It was produced by [[Rickey Minor]] and [[RedOne]], and executively produced by Richie, Jones and [[Haitian-American]] musician [[Wyclef Jean]]. A music video directed by [[Paul Haggis]] was released to accompany and promote the song.

"We Are the World 25 for Haiti" is musically structured similar to "We Are the World", but includes [[Auto-Tune]] and a rap verse, which was written by some of the song's [[hip hop]] artists. Michael Jackson [[death of Michael Jackson|died]] months before the song's release, but his material from the 1985 recording sessions was incorporated into the song and music video, as per the request of his mother, [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine]]. His younger sister [[Janet Jackson|Janet]] duets with him on the song, and his nephews Taj, TJ and Taryll<U+2014>collectively known as [[3T]]<U+2014>feature on the track's chorus. "We Are the World 25 for Haiti" received generally negative reviews by contemporary music critics, with criticism focused on the song's new musical additions, as well as the choice of artists who appear on the track. The song was commercially successful worldwide, charting within the top 20 in multiple countries.
