'''''Joust''''' is an [[arcade game]] developed by [[Williams Electronics]] and released in 1982. It is a [[platform game]] that features [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional (2D) graphics]]. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.

John Newcomer led the development team which included Bill Pfutzenrueter, Jan Hendricks, [[Python Anghelo]], Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik. Newcomer aimed to create a flying game with co-operative two-player gameplay, but wanted to avoid a space theme, which was popular at the time. Staff worked within the technical limitations of the hardware (originally developed two years earlier for Williams' first game, ''[[Defender (video game)|Defender]]''), excluding concepts and optimizing the visuals.

The game was well received in arcades and by critics, who praised the gameplay. The gameplay mechanics influenced titles by other developers. ''Joust'' was followed by a [[sequel]] three years later, and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms.

==Gameplay==

Within the platform is a set of yellow numbers.|The player navigates the yellow knight (''top center'') around the game world to defeat the enemy knights. Scores are kept track in the center portion of the bottom platform.]]

''Joust'' is a platforming game where the player controls a yellow knight riding a flying ostrich from a third-person perspective. The player navigates the protagonist around the game world, which consists of rock platforms floating above a flat island surrounded by lava, via two-way joystick and a button. Home console versions, however, use [[game controllers]] with [[D-pads|directional pads]] and [[analog stick]]s. The joystick controls the horizontal direction that the knight travels, while pressing the button makes the ostrich flap its wings. The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend. The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level, referred to as a "wave". Upon completing a wave, a subsequent, more challenging one will begin. Players navigate the knight to collide with enemies. The elevation of an enemy in relation to the player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. If the egg lands on a platform, it will hatch into another knight that must be defeated again. The game features three type of enemy knights<U+2014>Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord<U+2014>that are worth different amounts of points. A [[pterodactyl]] will appear after a predetermined time frame to hunt the hero. A second player, controlling a blue knight on a stork, can join the game. The two players can either [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperatively]] complete the waves or attack each other while competitively defeating enemies.<ref>{{cite journal| journal = [[Electronic Games]]| publisher = Reese Communications| title = Coin-Op Classroom: Some Knights to Remember| first = Bill| last = Heineman| pages = 114<U+2013>115| volume = 1| issue = 17| month = July| year = 1983}}</ref><ref name="Fever">{{cite book| title = Arcade Fever: The Fan's Guide to The Golden Age of Video Games| first = John| last = Sellers| pages = 94<U+2013>95| publisher = [[Running Press]]| month = August| year = 2001| isbn = 0762409371}}</ref>

== Development ==

''Joust'' was developed by [[Williams Electronics]], with John Newcomer as the lead designer. Programmer Bill Pfutzenrueter and artists Jan Hendricks and [[Python Anghelo]] assisted him. Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik handled the audio design.<ref name="RG-63">{{cite journal| journal = [[Retro Gamer]]| publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| title = The Making of Joust| first = Mike| last = Bevan| issue = 63| pages = 36<U+2013>41}}</ref> The game features amplified [[monaural]] sound and [[raster graphics]] on a 19&nbsp;inch color [[Cathode ray tube|CRT monitor]].<ref name="Arcade-Museum">{{cite web| url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8243| title = Joust <U+2013> Videogame by Williams Electronics| publisher = International Arcade Museum| accessdate = 2010-07-13}}</ref> Like other Williams arcade games, ''Joust'' was programmed in [[assembly language]].<ref name="Halcyon">{{cite book| title = [[Halcyon Days (book)|Halcyon Days]]: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Games Programmers| editor = James Hague| year = 1997| chapter = Eugene Jarvis| publisher = Dadgum Games| chapterurl = http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/JARVIS.HTM| accessdate = 2010-07-13}}</ref> A pack of three [[AA battery|AA batteries]] provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet.<ref name="PriceGuide-1">{{cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| pages = 337<U+2013>338| chapter = Arcade Classics| publisher = [[Random House]]| isbn = 0375720383| year = 2004}}</ref><ref name="PriceGuide-2">{{cite book| title = Official Price Guide to Classic Video Games| first = David| last = Ellis| pages = 433<U+2013>437| chapter = Classic Arcade Game Setup, Restoration, and Repair| publisher = [[Random House]]| isbn = 0375720383| year = 2004}}</ref> The cabinet artwork, by Anghelo, is stenciled on a wooden frame.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="PriceGuide-1"/> Anghelo also designed artwork for promotional materials;<ref name="RG-63"/> one such [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]] featured [[Early Modern English|archaic English]], which was also incorporated into the game's on-screen instructions.<ref name="Fever"/>

Following [[Eugene Jarvis]] and [[Larry DeMar]]'s departure from Williams, the company searched for new creative staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at Williams who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' and ''Joust'', Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of ''The War of the Worlds'' was infeasible, but ''Joust'' could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware.<ref name="RG-63"/> A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using [[Defender (video game)#Hardware|''Defender''{{'}}s hardware]].<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1">{{cite video game| title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]]| developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]| publisher= [[Midway Games]]| date= 2003-11-18| platform= [[PlayStation 2]]| version= | level= The Inside Story On Joust}}</ref>

Newcomer conceived ''Joust'' as a "flying game" with co-operative two-player gameplay. Rather than emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games like ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' and ''Defender'', he wanted to offer an alternative to spaceships. To that end, Newcomer made a list of things that could fly: machines, animals, and fictional characters. After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea, he chose birds, believing that they would have a wide appeal. Newcomer also felt that birds were a good fit as he was familiar with fantasy and science fiction media featuring birds. To further increase his understanding, Newcomer went to the library to study mythology. He felt that the primary protagonist should ride a majestic bird. The first choice was an eagle, but the lack of graceful land mobility dissuaded the designer. Instead, Newcomer chose an ostrich because he thought a flying ostrich was more believable than a running eagle. To differentiate between the first and second player characters, the developers picked a stork, believing the proportions were similar to an ostrich while the color difference would avoid confusion among players. Newcomer chose vultures as the main enemies, believing that they would be recognizably evil. Anghelo created concept of the characters as guidance for further design.<ref name="RG-63"/>

{{quote box| width = 35%| quote= "At the time ''Joust'' was done I was hoping to get a broader audience who may want to try a different skill. There were already plenty of shooting games they could play. I wanted to break some new ground. I felt I was already giving the player new things to do like having to flap, run and become so adept at flying that it would be the determining factor in how you collided and defeated an enemy. The cleanest thing I could think of to visually determine a winner was height."| source = John Newcomer on the premise and gameplay of ''Joust''<ref name="RG-63"/>}}

The decision to use birds prompted Newcomer to deviate from the then standard eight-direction joystick. He implemented a "flapping" mechanism to allow players to control the character's ascent and descent. With the vertical direction controlled via the arcade cabinet's button, a two-way joystick was added to dictate horizontal direction.<ref name="RG-63"/> Though other Williams employees were concerned over the design, Newcomer believed that a direct control scheme for flight would strengthen the connection between the player and the character.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> The combat is devised to allow for higher levels of strategy than traditional shooting games.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> Because flying became an integral gameplay element, he chose to have characters collide as a means of combat. Newcomer felt that the characters' heights on the screen were the best way to determine a victor.<ref name="RG-63"/>

The developers created the game using 96K of memory, which limited the file size of individual graphics and sound effects they could use.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> For example, memory limits prohibited Newcomer from creating more characters. The graphics were [[Pixel art|created at the pixel level]] and hand-animated.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> To animate the birds, Hendricks used [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s book ''Animals In Motion'' as a reference. Given the limited memory, he had to balance the number of frames to minimize file size, while maintaining realistic animation. Hendricks originally picked grey for the buzzards, but chose green instead to optimize the [[Palette (computing)|color palette]]<U+2014>the developers had only 16&nbsp;colors to create the visuals. Once the colors were decided for the character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], Newcomer finalized the look of the platforms. The hardware had limited audio capabilities, and sounds typically required larger amounts of memory than graphics. Working with these restrictions, Newcomer instructed Murphy and Kotlarik to focus on select sounds he deemed important to reinforcing gameplay. He reasoned that the audio would serve as conspicuous hints that players could use to adjust their strategy. Though Newcomer prioritized the wing flap, other sounds effects like those related to the pterodactyl, collisions, and hatching eggs were considered important as well.<ref name="RG-63"/>

In designing the levels, Newcomer added platforms to the environment after the combat was devised. A static game world was chosen over a scrolling world to showcase [[Texture (visual arts)|visual textures]] applied to the platforms. The hardware could not easily display the textures while scrolling, and the team felt that displaying the whole environment would aid players. The last game world element was a lava pit and a hand reaching out of it to destroy characters too close to the bottom. Newcomer placed the platforms to optimize Pfutzenrueter's enemy [[Game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI), which factors attack patterns based partly on platform placements. The knight enemies were designed to exhibit progressively more aggressive behavior. Bounders fly around the environment randomly, occasionally reacting to the protagonist. Hunters seek the player's character in an effort to collide. Shadow Lords fly quickly and closer to the top of the screen. Pfutzenrueter designed them to fly higher when close to the protagonist to increase the Shadow Lord's chances of victory against the player.<ref name="RG-63"/> The pterodactyl was designed to attack idle players and be difficult to defeat. The only vulnerability was attacking the creature in its open mouth during a specific animation frame. Newcomer and Pfutzenrueter designed the pterodactyl to quickly fly upward at the last moment when approaching a player waiting at the edge of platform. This was done to prevent an easy defeat of the enemy.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-3">{{cite video game| title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]]| developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]| publisher= [[Midway Games]]| date= 2003-11-18| platform= [[PlayStation 2]]| version= | level= Joust Interview Clip #3}}</ref> When processing the graphics, the game gives priority to the player characters over the enemies. As a result, enemies begin to react more slowly when the number of on-screen sprites increases.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2185/back_to_the_classics_perfecting_.php| title = Back To The Classics: Perfecting The Emulation For Digital Eclipse's Atari Anthology| first = Jeff| last = Vavasour| date = 2005-01-13| publisher = Gamasutra| accessdate = 2010-10-29}}</ref>

While [[playtest]]ing the game, the team discovered an animation [[Software bug|bug]] they described as a "belly flop".<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-2">{{cite video game| title= [[Midway Arcade Treasures]]| developer= [[Backbone Entertainment|Digital Eclipse]]| publisher= [[Midway Games]]| date= 2003-11-18| platform= [[PlayStation 2]]| version= | level= Joust Interview Clip #2}}</ref> The flaw allows players to force the ostrich or stork sprite through an otherwise impassable small gap between two adjacent platforms of very close elevation. Because it provided an interesting method to perform a sneak attack on an opponent below the gap, the developers decided to keep the defect rather than fix it.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-2"/> Newcomer also attributed excessive playtesting that limited the time available to find a solution.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> A second bug, which allows the pterodactyl to be easily defeated, was discovered after the game was first distributed. Newcomer designed the game and its AI with each sprite's dimension in mind. A day before the game was finished, however, the pterodactyl's sprite was altered to improve the appearance. The new sprite allowed the pterodactyl to be easily defeated by waiting at a ledge. Upon learning of the flaw, Williams shipped a new ROM for the arcade cabinets to assuage distributors' complaints.<ref name="RG-63"/><ref name="Arc-Treasure-3"/>

== Reception and legacy ==

Given the different control scheme, Williams was concerned that the game would be unsuccessful. Though arcades were hesitant to purchase the game for the same reason, ''Joust'' sold well. Williams eventually shipped 26,000&nbsp;units.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> A cocktail table version was later released, engineered by Leo Ludzia.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/> It differs from other cocktail games in that it features side-by-side seating rather than opposing sides.<ref name="Arc-Treasure-1"/><ref name="PriceGuide-1"/> This setup allowed Williams to use the same ROM chip as in the upright cabinets.<ref name="RG-63"/> The cabinets have since become collector's items.
