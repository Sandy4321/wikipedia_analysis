'''Universal Studios Hollywood''' is a [[movie studio]] in [[Universal City, California]], and is the original [[Universal Studios]] theme park. [[Woody Woodpecker]] is the mascot for [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and the rest of the [[Universal Studios Theme Parks]]. Its official marketing headline is "The Entertainment Capital of LA," though during the summer it is often advertised as  "The Coolest Place in LA." It was initially created to offer tours of the real Universal Studios soundstages and sets. It is the first of many fully-fledged [[Universal Studios Theme Parks]], along with [[Universal Orlando Resort|Universal Studios Orlando]], [[Universal Studios Japan]], and the upcoming [[Universal Studios Singapore]], [[Universal Studios Dubai]], and [[Universal Studios South Korea]] theme parks.

==Universal Hollywood Tour==
From the beginning, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] has offered tours of its studio.  In the [[silent-film]] days, [[Carl Laemmle]]'s tour included a chance to buy fresh produce, since then-rural [[Universal City, California|Universal City]] was still in part a working farm.  

Shortly after [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] took over Universal Pictures in [[1962]], accountants suggested a tour stop in the studio commissary would increase profits, and in [[1964]], the modest tour was expanded to include a series of dressing room walk-throughs, peeks at actual production, and later, staged events.  This grew over the years into a full-blown [[theme park]] - the narrated [[tram]] (formerly "Glamortram") tour still runs through the studio's active [[backlot]], but the staged events, [[stunt]] demonstrations and high-tech rides overshadow the motion-picture production that once lured fans in Universal Studios [[Hollywood]].  Universal City also includes hotels Universal [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] & Tower's, and the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts]]), a multi-screen theater, and [[Universal CityWalk]], which offers a collection of shops and restaurants, as well as the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]], a concert venue.

==Spawning point==
The company has since created Universal parks in other locations:  [[Universal Orlando Resort]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] and [[Universal Studios Japan]] in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Universal once owned [[Port Aventura]], [[Spain]], which was sold in [[2004]].
