The '''Senkaku Islands''', or '''Diaoyutai Islands''' are a group of [[territorial dispute|disputed]], uninhabited [[island]]s currently controlled by [[Japan]], but also claimed by both the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan). The islands are located roughly northeast of [[Taiwan]], due west of [[Okinawa]], and due north of the end of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] in the [[East China Sea]].

Their status has emerged as a major issue in [[Japan-People's Republic of China relations|foreign relations between China and Japan]]. [[Cross-Strait relations|Relations between the PRC and the ROC]] have also complicated the situation. 

==Naming==
==="Diaoyu Islands"===
The first recorded naming of the islands dated back to the Ming Dynasty of China(14th-17th century) in such books as Journey to Ryu Kyu.  The Chinese Imperial Map of the Ming Dynasty also used Diaoyudao Islands.

The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name for the island group (''Diaoyu'') and the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for the main island (''Uotsuri'') both literally mean "[[Angling]]".

==="Pinnacle Islands"===
In the 19th century, the '''Pinnacle Islands''' or '''Pinnacle Group''' was an English-language name used for the rocks adjacent to, but not including, the largest island ''Uotsuri Jima''/''Diaoyu Dao'' (then called '''Hoa-pin-su''').  Neither ''Kuba Jima''/''Huangwei Yu'' (then called '''Ti-a-usu''') nor ''Taish<U+014D> Jima''/''Chiwei Yu'' (then called "Raleigh Rock") were part of the Pinnacle Islands either.<ref>

However, in recent years the name "Pinnacle Islands" has come to be used to refer to the entire island group, as an English-language equivalent to "Diaoyu" or "Senkaku".

In the late 19th century, {{nihongo|''Sent<U+014D> Shosho''|<U+5C16><U+982D><U+8AF8><U+5DBC>}} and {{nihongo|''Senkaku Shosho''|<U+5C16><U+95A3><U+8AF8><U+5DBC>}} were translations used for these "Pinnacle Islands" by various Japanese sources.  Subsequently, the entire island group (including ''Uotsuri Jima''/''Diaoyu Dao'' and all the others) came to be called ''Senkaku Rett<U+014D>'', which later evolved into ''Senkaku Shot<U+014D>''.

===The islands group===

The islands sit on the edge of the continental shelf of mainland Asia, and are separated from the [[Ryukyu Islands]] by a sea trench.
Japan argues that these islets are part of the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. They are {{km to mi|wiki=yes|170}}<!-- 170 [[kilometre|km]]
---> north of [[Ishigaki Island]], Japan; {{km to mi|186|abbr=yes}}<!---186 km
---> northeast of [[Keelung]], Taiwan; and {{km to mi|410|abbr=yes}}<!---
410 km---> west of [[Okinawa Island]]. 

The group is made up of five small non-volcanic islands:

====Uotsuri Jima/Diaoyu Dao====
Uotsuri Jima (<U+9B5A><U+91E3><U+5CF6>) or Diaoyu Dao (<U+91E3><U+9B5A><U+5CF6><U+672C><U+5CF6> "Angling Island" or <U+4E3B><U+5CF6>) is the largest island of the Senkaku Islands. The Island located at {{coor dms|25|44|39|N|123|28|26|E|type:isle}} has an area of 4,3 km<U+00B2> (1,7 sq mi) and a highest elevation of 383m (1,256 ft). [http://watchizu.gsi.go.jp/cgi-bin/watchizu.cgi?id=38234355&slidex=900&slidey=100]

Uotsuri jima has a number of [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species such as the Senkaku mole ('' Nesoscaptor uchidai'') and ''Okinawa-kuro-oo-ari'' ant, but these have become threatened by [[Capra (genus)|domestic goats]] that were introduced to the island in 1978 and whose population has increased to over 300 since that time.<ref name = "Endemic">{{cite conference

== Territorial dispute ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Treaty of San Francisco]] -->
The islands are currently administered by Japan as a part of [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigaki City]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa prefecture]]. According to both the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] on [[Taiwan]] (ROC), the islands are part of [[Taiwan Province]] (Daxi Village (<U+5927><U+6EAA><U+91CC>), [[Toucheng Township]], [[Yilan County]], Taiwan Province).

=== Beginning of the dispute ===
When the US was to hand over the disputed islands to Japan,the PRC and ROC governments protested and reiterated their sovereignty over the islands. The ROC made the official anouncement on [[June 11]], [[1971]], followed by the PRC on [[December 30]]th. Despite the Chinese protest, the United States handed over the disputed islands to Japan in 1972.

=== Chinese claims ===
====Ming Dynasty claim====
China claims that the islands were within the [[Ming Dynasty]]'s sea-defense area and are a part of [[Taiwan]].<ref name="PeopleDaily2003">[http://english.people.com.cn/200305/25/eng20030525_117192.shtml "China's Diaoyu Islands Sovereignty is Undeniable"], People's Daily, 25-05-2003.  Retrieved 24-02-2007.</ref> According to the Chinese, China's sovereignty over the islands is dated to early 15<sup>th</sup> century, during the reign of the Ming Dynasty.  The name ''Diaoyutai'' first appeared in 1403 in the Chinese book ''Voyage with the Tail Wind'', which recorded the names of the islands that voyagers had passed on a trip from [[Fujian]] to the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]].  By 1534, all the major islets of the island group had been identified and named in the book ''Record of the Imperial Envoy to Ryukyu''.<ref name="PeopleDaily2003" />

====Qing Dynasty claim====
From 1624 until 1662, Taiwan and its surrounding islands were controlled by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] as a base for commerce. In 1662, the Dutch were driven out by ex-Ming Dynasty general [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]] (more popularly known as Koxinga). Zheng Chenggong and his successors established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] and controlled the area until 1683. That year, Zheng's grandson [[Zheng Ke-Shuang]] was defeated by [[Qing Dynasty]] forces led by Admiral [[Shi Lang]]. From then on, Qing Dynasty China gained effective control over [[Taiwan]] and its surrounding islands, including the islands in dispute today.<ref>[http://www.diaoyuislands.org/islands/hollysoil.html <U+4E2D><U+570B><U+9818><U+571F><U+91E3><U+9B5A><U+53F0>], DiaoyuIslands.org.  Retrieved on [[2007-02-26]].</ref>

====Unequal Treaties====
After losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] [[China]] signed the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] on [[17 April]], [[1895]]. This [[Unequal Treaties|Unequal Treaty]] ceded Taiwan and its surrounding islands to Japan, although without explicitly mentioning the islands in dispute today. The formal position of China is that all the [[Unequal Treaties]] are null and void and thus the islands are still part of [[Taiwan Province]] of [[China]]. <ref name="Tzou">{{cite book|last=Tzou|first=Byron N.|title=China and International Law: The Boundary Disputes|year=1990|publisher=Praeger/Greenwood|pages=78|isbn=0275934624}}</ref>

====Tokyo court ruling====
China also asserted that in 1944, the Tokyo court ruled that the islands were part of [[Taihoku Prefecture]] ([[Taipei]] Prefecture), following a dispute between [[Okinawa Prefecture]] and Taihoku Prefecture. However, the assertion was solely based on a "claim" by the president of the fishermen's association of Keelung city in [[4 August]], [[1971]]. The primary source of this paragraph can be found in the journal "Modern China Studies", Issue 1, 1997 (in [[Simplified Chinese]]). [http://www.chinayj.net/StubArticle.asp?issue=970111&total=56].

=== Japanese claims ===
====Formal incorporation====
Japan claims that after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the Japanese government conducted surveys of the islands beginning in 1885 confirming no evidence that the uninhabited islands had been under Chinese control, though this conflicts with the earlier Chinese claim of the islands during the [[Qing Dynasty]]. At the time of this survey, Japan did not formally declare a claim to the islands. Instead, it waited until [[January 14]], [[1895]], during the middle of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], to do this. Just three months prior to its military victory in the war and the signing of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], Japan erected a marker on the islands to formally incorporate them as its territory. This decision was not made public until 1950, however. [http://english.people.com.cn/200305/25/eng20030525_117192.shtml] Four of the islands were subsequently borrowed and developed by the Koga family with the permission of the Japanese government.

====History of Ming====
Japanese scholars claim that neither [[China]] nor [[Ry<U+016B>ky<U+016B> Kingdom|Ryukyu]] had recognized sovereignty over the uninhabited islands. Therefore, they claim that Chinese documents only prove that Kumejima, the first inhabited island reached by the Chinese, belonged to Okinawa. Kentaro Serita (<U+82B9><U+7530><U+5065><U+592A><U+90CE>) of Kobe University points out that the official history book of the Ming Dynasty compiled during the Qing Dynasty, called the ''[[History of Ming]]'' (<U+660E><U+53F2>), describes Taiwan in the "Stories of Foreign Countries" (<U+5916><U+56FD><U+5217><U+4F20>). Thus, China did not control the Senkaku Islands or Taiwan during the Ming Dynasty. [http://akebonokikaku.hp.infoseek.co.jp/page092.html]  However, supporters of China claim the Qing Dynasty gained control of Taiwan and its surrounding islands in 1683, which was 39 years after the fall of the [[Ming Dynasty]].

====Beiyang warlord admission====
In a testimonial in 1920, a diplomat from the Chinese [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang warlord government]] admitted that the islands belonged to the Yaeyama District of Okinawa prefecture since Taiwan and its surrounding islands(including the disputed islands) were ceded to Japan in 1895 in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. However, China argues that Taiwan (include its surrounding islands) is an inalienable part of China. [http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/27/content_17613.htm The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue]

==== United States occupation ====
Japan claims that after [[World War II]], the islands came under the United States occupation of Okinawa. During this period, the United States and the Ry<U+016B>ky<U+016B> Government administered the islands and the US Navy even used Kuba-jima and Taisho-jima as maneuver areas. In 1972, sovereignty over Okinawa, and arguably the surrounding islands, was handed back to Japan as part of the [[Treaty of San Francisco]]. 

Supporters of ROC reject Japan's claim, stating that the ROC government maintains sovereignty over the islands. They assert that when US forces were stationed on Taiwan during the Cold War, military maneuvers were periodically held which required the use of the islands as an aerial bombing target, and the US military applied each time to the ROC government, instead of to Japanese authorities, for authorization.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

Supporters of ROC also argue that the 1954 ROC-US Mutual Defense Treaty contains wording implying that the ROC controlled the islands. The ROC government and the US later agreed to have US forces patrol the area several miles north of the island of Taiwan. Thus, the ROC had agreed to have US forces patrol the area around the islands.{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

===Recent developments===
*1978: The Japan Youth Association set up a lighthouse on the main island.  
*[[July 14]], [[1996]]: The Japan Youth Association builds a 5-m high, solar-powered, aluminum lighthouse on another island. 
*[[September 14]], [[1996]]: a US State Department spokesman referred to the US's neutral position on the Senkaku Islands issue.
*[[September 26]], [[1996]]: [[David Chan]] (<U+9673><U+6BD3><U+7965>), a [[Hong Kong]] protester, drowns near the islets, after leaping off one of the protest vessels with several companions with the object of symbolizing Chinese claim of sovereignty. 
*[[October 7]], [[1996]]: Protesters plant the flags of the [[flag of the Republic of China|ROC]] and the [[flag of the People's Republic of China|PRC]] on the main island, but are later removed by Japanese authorities.
* [[April 09]], [[1999]]: US Ambassador to Japan Thomas S. Foley said "we are not, as far as I understand, taking a specific position in the dispute.... we do not assume that there will be any reason to engage the security treaty in any immediate sense."
*April [[2002]]: The Japanese government leased Uotsuri and other islands from the purported private owners.
*[[March 24]], [[2004]]: A group of Chinese activists from the PRC planned to stay on the Islands for three days. The seven people who landed on the islands were arrested by Japanese authorities for illegal entry. The Japanese Foreign Ministry forwarded a complaint to the PRC government, but the PRC in turn demanded the release of the activists. They were then sent to Japan and deported from there. Japan subsequently stated that it would prohibit anybody from landing on the islands without prior permission.
*[[March 24]], [[2004]]: Adam Ereli, Deputy Spokesman at the US State Department said "The U.S. does not take a position on the question of the ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku Diaoyu Islands."
*February [[2005]]: Japan planned to take ownership of a privately-owned [[lighthouse]] on Uotsuri, after it was offered to them by the owner, a fisherman living on [[Ishigaki, Okinawa]]. The lighthouse is expected to be managed by the [[Japanese Coast Guard]].
*[[February 10]], [[2005]]: On [[Voice of America]], U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton said that Japan's new assertiveness is in line with the desires of many Japanese politicians to take their country beyond its post-World War Two reliance on the United States. "It's a question of the evolution of Japanese thinking on its own. Japan has made it clear they want to resolve all of the territorial disputes by diplomatic means and that's certainly something that we agree with. Our kind of getting in the middle of it is probably not the most productive way to proceed."
*[[June 2005]]: The ROC dispatched a [[Republic of China Navy|ROCN]] [[frigate]] into disputed waters (but did not go as far as the islands) after Taiwanese fishing vessels were harassed by Japanese patrol boats. The frigate, which was carrying Legislative Yuan President [[Wang Jin-pyng]] and ROC Defense Minister [[Lee Jye]], was not challenged and returned to Taiwan without incident. Fisheries talks between Taipei and Tokyo were held in July, but did not cover sovereignty issues.
*[[March 17]], [[2006]]: [[Kyodo News]] reported the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, [[Tom Schieffer|Thomas Schieffer]], presented that he considered "the Islands as territory of Japan" in his talk in Tokyo.<ref>(ja) [[Kyodo News]], March 17, 2006[http://flash24.kyodo.co.jp/?MID=HKK&PG=STORY&NGID=poli&NWID=2006031701004741]</ref>
*[[October 27]], [[2006]]: A group of activists from [[Hong Kong]], the [[Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands]], including [[Tsang Kin Shing]] and several members of the [[April Fifth Action]], approched the islands in order to show the support for Chinese claims to the Senkakus. They were stopped from landing on the islands by the Japan Coast Guard.<ref>[[International Herald Tribune]]/[[Associated Press]], October 26, 2006 [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/27/asia/AS_GEN_Japan_China_Disputed_Islands.php "Activist ship from Hong Kong briefly enters Japan's waters in protest over islands"]</ref> Later on, the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|PLAN]] conducted a military exercise in the area.<ref>(ja) [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], November 5, 2006, [http://www.nikkei.co.jp/china/news/20061103r2m0300z03.html "<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+3001><U+6771><U+30B7><U+30CA><U+6D77><U+3067><U+8ECD><U+4E8B><U+6F14><U+7FD2><U+4E2D><U+306B><U+7206><U+767A><U+4E8B><U+6545>"]</ref>
