'''Brownhills''' is a [[town]] in the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], [[England]]. Located on the edge of [[Cannock Chase]] near the large man-made lake [[Chasewater]], it is {{convert|6|mi|km|1|lk=on}} north-east of [[Walsall]] and a similar distance south-west of [[Lichfield]].  It is part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall]] and the [[Aldridge-Brownhills (UK Parliament constituency)|Aldridge-Brownhills]] parliamentary constituency and neighbours the ancient villages of [[Pelsall]] and [[Stonnall]]. Before boundary changes in 1974, it was in the county of [[Staffordshire]].

The town lies on the ancient [[Watling Street]], but is not recorded before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the [[Domesday Book]].  Brownhills quickly grew around the [[coal mining]] industry, especially after it became linked to the [[canal]] and [[railway]] networks in the mid-19th century, and by the end of the century had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to a town with a population of over {{formatnum:13000}}, of whom the vast majority were employed in the coal industry.  Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a severe economic decline which has continued until the present day.  The local authority has instituted a regeneration programme which it is hoped will revive the town's fortunes, providing better transport and leisure facilities.

==History==
Brownhills is situated on the ancient [[Watling Street]] and there is evidence of early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle.<ref name="Walsall" /><ref name="W2" /> The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining [[Slag heap|spoil heaps]] which dotted the area.<ref name="Reece10" />  

[[Image:PlotStaffs.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Plot's 1680 map of Staffordshire shows "Brownhill".]]
The settlement is first recorded (as "Brownhill") on [[Robert Plot]]'s 1680 map of [[Staffordshire]], at which time it was a hamlet within the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Ogley Hay, which in turn was part of the [[parish]] of [[Norton Canes]].<ref name="Reece10">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p10}}</ref>  Ogley Hay itself had existed since at least the 11th century and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]],<ref name="Walsall" /> although the 1801 census lists it as having a population of only 8 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/STS/OgleyHay/index.html|title=Ogley Hay|publisher=GENUKI: UK & Ireland Genealogy|accessdate=2007-10-09|date=[[2000-06-03]]|author=Mike Harbach}}</ref>  Beyond Ogley Hay lay Catshill, another hamlet which pre-dated Brownhills and which lay within the parish of [[Shenstone, Staffordshire|Shenstone]].

During the 17th century, shallow mine workings began to develop in the area and in 1759 a [[turnpike]] was erected in the Catshill area.<ref name="Walsall" />  A local legend claims that [[Dick Turpin]] once vaulted the barricade on his horse to avoid paying the toll,<ref>{{cite book |   first=Jan|last= Farrow |   title=Yesterday's Staffordshire Volume 3: Brownhills and Walsall Wood|   publisher=Reflections of a Bygone Age |   year=1992|   id=ISBN 0-9462-4560-6|pages=p3}}</ref> although this is demonstrably false as Turpin was executed in 1739, twenty years before the turnpike's construction. In 1794 Brownhills (now in the plural) was included in a list of local settlements mentioned in an [[Act of Parliament]] concerning canals in [[Staffordshire]],<ref name="Reece19">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p19}}</ref> and three years later the [[Wyrley & Essington Canal]], nicknamed the "Curly Wyrley" by the locals due to its winding course, was opened.<ref name="Walsall" /><ref name="Reece17">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p17}}</ref>  In 1799 Norton Pool, later to be renamed [[Chasewater]], was created to serve as a reservoir for the canals.<ref name="W2" />

Early in the 19th century, a horse-drawn [[tram]] system connected the mines to the wharves on the canal. In response to the growing population of the area open land in Ogley Hay, up until then merely heathland, was enclosed and converted to farmland in 1838, the same year in which the area was first declared a [[parish]], although no church was built for another 13 years.<ref name="W2" />  Charles Foster Cotterill, a former mayor of [[Walsall]] who had purchased the manor of Ogley Hay in 1836 upon the death of former lord Phineas Hussey, saw the potential of the area and sold off large tracts of his land for private farming and the construction of a [[gristmill|flour mill]] and a [[foundry]].<ref name="Reece6768">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=pp67&ndash;68}}</ref>  The remaining land of the former manor was progressively sold off through a series of [[indenture]]s of questionable legality until 1846 when Cotterill sold the last 135 acres and moved to [[London]].<ref name="Reece75">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=pp75&ndash;76}}</ref>

The [[South Staffordshire Railway]] reached Brownhills in 1850 and led to a huge expansion of the local mining operation and with it a population explosion in the area,<ref name="Reece102">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p102}}</ref> with the population increasing from 305 in 1801 to over 13,000 in 1891.<ref name="Walsall" />  In 1858 a branch line was constructed through the heart of what was then the hamlet of Brownhills, which led to a migration of the population eastwards, leading to the formation of mining slums in the Ogley Hay area. Eventually a new town centre developed, complete with library and theatre.<ref name="W2">{{cite web|url=http://www.walsall.gov.uk/index/brownhills_in_history.htm|title=Brownhills in History|publisher=Walsall Council|accessdate=2007-10-31|date=[[2007-06-19]]|author=Gerald Reece}}</ref>  This led to the gradual amalgamation of Brownhills, Ogley Hay and Catshill into one town.<ref name="Reece11" />

[[Image:BrownhillsMiners.jpg|right|thumb|Brownhills miners depicted on a picture postcard from 1904]]
Mining was to remain the principal industry of Brownhills until the last pit closed in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walsall.gov.uk/news/former_mine_owner_to_declare_landmark_open.htm|title=Former mine owner to declare landmark open|publisher=Walsall Council|accessdate=2007-10-11|date=[[2006-05-18]]}}</ref>  During the 18th and 19th centuries the area known as Coppice Side was the hub of the mining industry, and the census of 1841 showed that over 80% of the population of the area which makes up modern Brownhills lived and worked there,<ref name="Reece11">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p11}}</ref> with up to ten pits active in the area at any one time.<ref name="Reece89">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p89}}</ref>  As in other mining areas, several men lost their lives in the Brownhills pits. Seven miners, including a boy aged 11, died in an accident in 1861, and in October 1930 an explosion at the Grove Colliery killed fourteen miners, ten of them from Brownhills.<ref>{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p109}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p111}}</ref>

In 1877 the town of Brownhills was officially recognised for the first time after a new Act authorised the amalgamation of rural districts into larger local government areas. An order was issued on [[29 September]] stating:<ref name="Reece32">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p32}}</ref>

{{cquote|The Local Government Board have proposed to declare the Parish of Norton under Cannock, the Chapelry of Hammerwich, the Parish of Ogley Hay, and parts of the Parish of Shenstone and of the Township of Walsall Foreign to be a Local Government District under the name of the Brownhills District.}} 

After the [[First World War]], the Urban District Council, which had replaced the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased for the building of [[council house]]s, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human habitation, was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland within the boundaries of Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.<ref name="Reece7980">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=pp79&ndash;80}}</ref>

By the time of the [[Second World War]] the mines of Brownhills, being amongst the oldest in the area, were largely exhausted,<ref name="J1">{{cite book |   first=Patricia|last= Reece |   title=Jennie Lee: A Life|   publisher=Oxford University Press |   year=1998|   id=ISBN 0-1928-8105-1|pages=p134}}</ref> and following the nationalisation of the mining industry the final pit on the Common was closed in the 1950s. Following the demise of the coalfield the town experienced a severe economic slump, with many high street shops closing down. A wave of new development in the 1960s and 1970s saw a new shopping precinct planned, which it was claimed would incorporate a cinema, bowling alley, hotel and bus station and would completely revitalise the town. Despite the developers' grandiose claims, the project was not a success and ultimately consisted solely of shopping units, many of which stood empty for up to five years.<ref>{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p49}}</ref>  There was little further development in the 1980s and 1990s, and the feeling of the local council is that the town centre is in need of improvement. To this end the council has created a "Townscape Masterplan" for the redevelopment of the town.<ref name="regen">{{cite web|url=http://www.walsall.gov.uk/ch15_inset_brownhills.pdf|format=PDF|title=Walsall Unitary Development Plan: Brownhills District Centre|publisher=Walsall Council|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref>

==Governance==
[[Image:BrownhillsCouncilHouse.jpg|thumb|right|The Council House was originally the seat of Brownhills District Council. Currently it houses the town's health centre and library.]]
Brownhills is represented by three tiers of government, [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall|Walsall Borough Council]] ("local"), UK Parliament ("national"), and European Parliament ("Europe").  

The Brownhills District established in 1877 remained in existence until 1894 when it was superseded by Brownhills Urban District. In 1966 the Urban District merged with that of [[Aldridge]] to form the [[Aldridge-Brownhills]] Urban District, in accordance with a recommendation of the [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)|Local Government Commission for England]]. This in turn was amalgamated in 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], into the newly formed [[Metropolitan Borough of Walsall]], under whose jurisdiction the area remains to this day. As a result of this amalgamation Brownhills also became part of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands county]], having previously been part of [[Staffordshire]].<ref name="Reece33">{{cite book |   first=Gerald|last= Reece |   title=Brownhills: A Walk Into History|   publisher=Walsall Local History Centre |   year=1996|   id=ISBN 0-9466-5242-2|pages=p33}}</ref>  Today Brownhills constitutes a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] within the Borough of Walsall and has three seats on the Borough Council. As at the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2007|2007 local elections]] two of these seats were held by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and one by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.walsall.gov.uk/CMISWebPublic/Members.aspx|publisher=Walsall Council|title=Council members|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref>

Brownhills is located at {{coord|52|38|49.20|N|1|55|58.80|W|city|display=inline}} on the edge of [[Cannock Chase]] and lies mostly at a height of approximately 150&nbsp;metres&nbsp;(492&nbsp;feet) above [[sea level]], although there is a sharp incline to nearly 180&nbsp;metres&nbsp;(590&nbsp;feet) at the eastern end of the town.<ref name="OS">{{cite map|publisher=Ordnance Survey|title=Landranger Map Sheet 139: Birmingham and Wolverhampton |url=|edition=C4|section=|accessdate=2007-10-18}}</ref>  The highest point of Cannock Chase, standing at 244&nbsp;metres&nbsp;(801&nbsp;feet) above sea level,<ref name="ring">{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53397|publisher=Victoria County History|last=Midgley|first=L.

[[Image:BrownhillsParade.jpg|thumb|right|The Parade cuts across the easternmost part of Brownhills Common.]]
Immediately to the west of the town is Brownhills Common, a 100-acre heathland which once formed part of Cannock Forest (also known as "Canke Wood").<ref name="CW" />  Although the forest was felled in the 15th and 16th centuries, the spread of [[Canulla|heather]] and the grazing of [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] led to the creation of a huge area of heathland.

The decline of the mining industry in the 1950s caused a severe economic slump in Brownhills, which continues to this day. The local authority has created a "Townscape Masterplan" for the regeneration of Brownhills, which involves increased leisure provision, the improvement of the town centre's shopping facilities, a new transport interchange incorporating Park and Ride facilities and cycle links to the town centre and the [[National Cycle Route]], and the refurbishment of run-down properties.<ref name="regen" />  The plan also involves the potential construction of a bypass to relieve the heavily congested High Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walsall.gov.uk/index/brownhills_transport_package_.htm|publisher=Walsall Council|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Brownhills Transport Package|date=[[2007-10-12]]}}</ref>  In addition to these developments, a grant of over <U+00A3>350,000 was obtained to fund the creation of a new "mini town square",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.walsall.gov.uk/newsdocs/NewsArticle.asp?NewsId=1059|publisher=Walsall Council|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Council wins massive Euro grant for Brownhills|date=[[2003-08-06]]}}</ref> and the demolition of blocks of high-rise flats in the town has begun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcn-society.co.uk/BCNS_Photo_Gallery8.php|publisher=The Birmingham Canal Navigations Society|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Wyrley & Essington Canal + Anglesey Branch}}</ref>

The High Street retains various independent shops, including a cobbler and a butcher, but is seen as in need of improvement. Walsall Council's regeneration programme includes extensive redevelopment of the High Street; the council's view is that retail investment should be focussed on the existing shopping area rather than encouraging new developments outside this area as, based on consultants' studies, the council believes that the town could not support large-scale retail development. Specific development opportunities within the vicinity of the High Street have been identified, with particular focus on land on Silver Street, adjacent to the canal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walsall.gov.uk/ch15_inset_brownhills.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Walsall Council|accessdate=2007-10-15|title=Brownhills District Centre}}</ref>
