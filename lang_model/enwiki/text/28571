The '''history of local government in Yorkshire''' is unique and complex. [[Yorkshire]] is the largest [[Historic counties of England|historic]] [[Counties of England|English county]]<ref name=vision_ancient>Vision of Britain - [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10134640&c_id=10001043 Yorkshire ancient county] ([http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/bound_map_page.jsp?first=true&u_id=10134640&c_id=10001043 historic map])</ref> and consists of a diverse mix of urban and rural development with a heritage in [[agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], and [[mining]].<ref>John Bartholomew, ''[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=1823270&word=NULL Gazetteer of the British Isles]'', (1887)</ref> After a long period of very little change, it has been subject to a number of significant reforms of local government structures in modern times, some of which were controversial.<ref name=hmso>HMSO, ''Aspects of Britain: Local Government'', (1996)</ref> The most significant of these was the [[Local Government Act 1972]]<ref name=arnold>Arnold-Baker, C., ''Local Government Act 1972'', (1973)</ref> and the [[1990s UK local government reform]]. It currently corresponds to several [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|counties and districts]] and is mostly contained within the [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] region.

==Identity==
The people of Yorkshire are traditionally renowned for identifying with their county, above their country of [[England]].<ref name="major_speech">Major, J., ''[http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&obj_id=11797&speeches=1 Speech to a Conservative Party rally in Brighton]'', [[29 May]] [[2001]], Conservatives.com</ref> There is a long standing and powerful view that "''Yorkshire is a [[country]] on its own inside of another country''" and that Yorkshire has a significantly strong regional identity.<ref>Tomlinson, A., ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=05Uc_-1de1IC&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=%22yorkshire+is+a+country+on+its+own+inside+of+another+country%22&source=web&ots=RKh6U-Ovya&sig=Bg2TgYAGRAQ0mVGOBU_b4lgtA7A Power Games: A Critical Sociology of Sport]'', (2002)</ref>

== Ancient divisions ==
[[Image:Yorkshire Ridings.png|thumb|Yorkshire ridings:<br>1. North<br>2. West<br>3. East]]
Yorkshire originated in antiquity as the [[J<U+00F3>rv<U+00ED>k|Kingdom of J<U+00F3>rv<U+00ED>k]]. It was traditionally divided into [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West]], [[North Riding of Yorkshire|North]] and [[East Riding of Yorkshire|East]] [[Riding (division)|riding]]s. The term originates from [[Old Norse]] ''<U+00FE>ri<U+00F0>ing'', "third part", a legacy of the area's ninth century [[Scandinavia]]n settlers. Each of the ridings was then further subdivided into smaller units called [[Wapentakes]], which were administered by an early form of democratic representation termed a "[[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]". Later the wapentakes were used as the basis for administration. In about 1823 the wapentakes were:

==Modern local government==
[[Image:Yorkshire-734x560.jpg|thumb|1904 map of Yorkshire]]
The borough corporations of Beverley, Doncaster, Kingston upon Hull, Leeds, Pontefract, Richmond, Ripon, Scarborough and York were reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. In 1889, as part of the [[Local Government Act 1888]], Yorkshire was divided into administrative counties (each with a [[county council]]) and county boroughs. The administrative counties closely followed the ancient ridings, with the exclusion of the large towns of Bradford, Halifax, Huddersfield, Kingston upon Hull, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Sheffield and York. Yorkshire continued to be classed as a single county under the act, although each of the ridings retained their own lieutenancies and shrievalties. York became associated with the West Riding for this purpose. In 1894 the remainder of the county, that was not a county borough or municipal ('non-county') borough, was divided into urban and rural districts by the [[Local Government Act 1894]]. Several new county boroughs were created from 1889 to 1974:

The North Riding gained {{convert|6252|acre|km2}} from [[County Durham]] when the Teesside county borough was created in 1968.<ref name=vision_anr/>

===Distribution of population in 1971===

With the creation and growth of county boroughs, and a movement of people from the country to the towns and cities, the population in the county boroughs began to outnumber those in the administrative counties. By 1971, 53% of the population of Yorkshire were living in the county boroughs. The division of population in 1971 was as follows:<ref>1971 census</ref>

==Changes in 1974==

Local government in England was reformed in 1974 by the [[Local Government Act 1972]].<ref name=elcock>Elcock, H, ''Local Government'', (1994)</ref> Under the act, the ridings lost their lieutenancies and shrievalties and the administrative counties, county boroughs and their councils were abolished.<ref name=arnold/> The area of Yorkshire was divided between a number of [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties]]:<ref name=mw>Redcliffe-Maud & Wood, B., ''English Local Government Reformed'', (1974) </ref>

| [[Bradford]], [[Calderdale]] (Centred on [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]), [[Kirklees]] (including [[Dewsbury]] and [[Huddersfield]]), [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]] from the West Riding
|}

The reform sought to amalgamate the urbanised parts of the West Riding in the South and West Yorkshire [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]].<ref name=jones>Jones, B. et al, ''Politics UK'', (2004)</ref> The other counties, known as ''non-metropolitan'' or [[shire county|shire counties]],<ref name=jones/> recognised the urbanised areas that had developed around the [[River Tees]] and the [[Humber]], leaving [[North Yorkshire]] as a predominantly rural county. The metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties also became counties for purposes such as lieutenancy.<ref name=arnold/>

===Royal Mail reaction===

The Royal Mail adopted South, North and West Yorkshire as [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|postal counties]] in 1974. It also recognised the transfers from Yorkshire to Cumbria, Durham and Lancashire and the creation of Cleveland. In Humberside, the part from Yorkshire became the [[North Humberside]] postal county. Greater Manchester could not be adopted as a postal county, so Saddleworth (which was part of the Oldham [[post town]]) was included in the Lancashire postal county. Postal counties are no longer in official use.<ref>Royal Mail, ''Address Management Guide'', (2004)</ref>

===District name changes===

Some of the changes were unpopular,<ref name=hmso/> and a provision of the 1972 act allowed district councils to change the names of their districts. Within Humberside, the [[Beverley (borough)|Borough of Beverley]] was changed to ''East Yorkshire Borough of Bevereley'' and [[East Yorkshire (district)|North Wolds district]] was changed to ''East Yorkshire'' in 1981, reflecting their historic association with Yorkshire.

==1990s UK local government reform==

A [[1990s UK local government reform|review of local government]] took place during the 1990s which made a number of changes to the counties created in 1974.<ref name=hmso/> As part of the review, Cleveland<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950187_en_1.htm The Cleveland (Structural Change) Order 1995] SI 1995/187</ref> and Humberside<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950600_en_1.htm The Humberside (Structural Change) Order 1995] SI 1995/600</ref> were abolished in 1996 and their districts were reconstituted as [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. In addition to becoming a unitary authority, the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] was reintroduced as a county for the purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty (also including Hull) and [[North Yorkshire]] gained territory for this purpose; the changes to the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] were reconfirmed by the [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]]. The unitary districts created are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

| [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] || Humberside: Beverley, Boothferry (part), East Yorkshire, Holderness  || East Riding of Yorkshire
