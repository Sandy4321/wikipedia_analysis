Between 1900 and 1934 the African American population in Chicago grew from 30,000 to 236,000.<ref name=THBHvL/>  The population was initially diluted in scattered places, but during this time, due to the change in the [[Demographics of Chicago|demographics of Chicago]], it became concentrated in two large strips of land.<ref name=THBHvL/>  The racial concentration was enforced by violence for few decades, until restrictive covenants became the preferred way to enforce [[segregation]].<ref name=THBHvL>{{cite journal|url=http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol20/Issue3/DavisVol20No3_Kamp.pdf|title=The History Behind Hansberry v.
