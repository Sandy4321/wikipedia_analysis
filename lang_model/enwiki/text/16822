'''''Benefits Street''''' is a British documentary series broadcast on [[Channel 4]]. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, and ran for five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, [[Winson Green]], [[Birmingham]], England, where newspapers including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that 90% of the residents claim [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|benefits]]. It shows benefits claimants committing crimes, including a demonstration of how to [[shoplifting|shoplift]], and portrays a situation in which people are dependent on welfare payments and lack the motivation to seek employment.

The show was controversial, with the police, Channel 4 and the media regulator [[Ofcom]] receiving hundreds of complaints. There were [[Twitter]] death threats made against the residents of the street. Channel 4 was accused of making [[poverty porn]]. Many of those taking part claimed that they were misled by the documentary makers. However, the producers of ''Benefits Street'' defended the series, arguing that the reaction to it demonstrated the importance of making such a documentary. The series was mentioned in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and prompted some political debate on the topic of welfare. ''Benefits Street'' gave Channel 4 their highest viewing figures for any show since 2012.

==Background==
In 2012, Love Productions approached the BBC with the idea for a programme that would feature a prominent member of the business community working with unemployed people, but the show did not come to fruition after the unnamed individual had to withdraw from it because of other commitments. The format for the series that would later become ''Benefits Street'' was then suggested, but the BBC declined to commission the series because it was producing a number of other programmes concerning similar issues, such as ''[[People Like Us (Harpurhey)|People Like Us]]'' and ''Nick and Margaret: We All Pay Your Benefits''. Love Productions then suggested the format to Channel 4, which agreed to commission the programme.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jamie |last=Doward |first2=Tara |last2=Conlan |url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/18/bbc-rejected-benefits-street-two-years-ago |title=BBC rejected early version of Benefits Street two years ago |newspaper=The Observer |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=18 January 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref>

Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' in January 2014, Nick Mirsky, head of documentaries at Channel 4, said that Love Productions intentionally selected an area where a high proportion of the residents were in receipt of welfare payments "to show the effect of benefit cuts on a community for whom they were the principal source of income".<ref name=Guardian-2014-01-10>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/10/benefits-street-documentary-reality |title=Benefits Street struck a nerve <U+2013> exposing how vital a documentary it is |first=Nick |last=Mirsky |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> The filming and production process took eighteen months.<ref name=Independent-2014-01-07>{{cite news|first=Ian |last=Burrell |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/channel-4s-benefits-street-sparks-anger-and-threats-of-violence-9044880.html |title=<U+2018>Benefits Street<U+2019>: Channel 4 documentary sparks anger and threats of violence |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=7 January 2014 |accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> Both Mirsky, and Ralph Lee, Channel 4's head of factual programming, said the residents of James Turner Street were consulted about the series before filming began.<ref name=Guardian-2014-01-10/><ref name=Independent-2014-01-10>{{cite news|first=Daisy |last=Wyatt |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/benefits-street-channel-4-boss-denies-shows-residents-were-duped-9051050.html |title=Benefits Street: Channel 4 boss denies show's residents were duped |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref> Cameras observed them over the course of a twelve month period.<ref name=Guardian-2014-01-10/> The decision to call the series ''Benefits Street'' was taken two weeks before the programme aired.<ref name=Independent-2014-01-10/> The comedian [[Frank Skinner]], who is from the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], was approached to narrate the documentary but turned it down because he had concerns about how people from Birmingham would be portrayed, and did not wish to criticise the city.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roz |last=Laws |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/frank-skinner-turned-down-benefits-6503474 |title=Frank Skinner turned down Benefits Street job over fears about how Brummies would be portrayed |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> The [[voice-over]] was provided by former ''[[Coronation Street]]'' actor [[Tony Hirst]] instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobsons-international.com/voices/1754/tony_hirst |title=Tony Hirst - voiceover artists |publisher=Hobsons International |date= |accessdate=13 February 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6NMCE79Se |archivedate=13 February 2014 |quote=[Hirst] can be heard on Absolute Radio, the long running Discovery series, 'How it's Made' and is the voice of Channel 4's 'Benefit Street'}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
Narrated by [[Tony Hirst]], the series is presented in a [[fly on the wall]] documentary format that follows a year in the lives of the residents of James Turner Street, a road in the Winson Green area of Birmingham which Channel 4 describes as "one of Britain's most benefit-dependent streets". The programme portrays a situation in which people are dependent on welfare payments, and often lack the motivation to find employment. Some residents are seen committing crimes such as shoplifting, and attempting to raise money to support themselves and their families. Others are shown to have more ambition, such as a young mother who wants to become a model. The series also aims to show the street's sense of community spirit, with residents helping each other in times of difficulty.

===Political and media response===
The programme led to some political debate on the issue of welfare. Speaking in the House of Commons on 13 January, [[Iain Duncan Smith]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions]] suggested the programme justified the changes being made by the [[Cameron ministry|Conservative<U+2013>Liberal Democrat coalition government]]'s [[Welfare Reform Act 2012|Welfare Reform Act]].<ref name=Mirror-2014-01-13/> The following week, Duncan Smith gave a speech to mark the tenth anniversary of his [[Centre for Social Justice]] in which he said that areas of the country were being ghettoised by long term unemployment and had remained largely hidden from the rest of society.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dominiczak |first=Peter |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/10590933/Iain-Duncan-Smith-Ill-stop-Benefits-Street-Britain.html |title=Iain Duncan Smith: I<U+2019>ll stop Benefits Street Britain |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=Guardian-2014-01-22>{{cite news|first=Patrick |last=Wintour |url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/22/duncan-smith-benefits-street-shock |title=Benefits Street reveals 'ghetto' reality, says Iain Duncan Smith |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25866259 |work=BBC News |title=Benefits Street reaction shows poor 'ghettoised', says Duncan Smith |publisher=BBC |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref> Conservative MP [[Simon Hart]] raised the subject of ''Benefits Street'' at [[Prime Minister's Questions]] on 15 January, saying that a street of the type seen in the series existed "in every constituency in the land".<ref name=BBC-2014-01-15>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25746824 |work=BBC News |title=PMQs: Benefit Street 'in every constituency' says MP |publisher=BBC |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/10949470.MP_stands_by_his___39_Benefits_Street__39__in_every_constituency__comments/ |title=MP stands by his 'Benefits Street' in every constituency comments |newspaper=Western Telegraph |publisher= |date=20 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> Prime Minister and Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] responded that the government should "intervene in people's lives" to get them off benefits and into employment.<ref name=BBC-2014-01-15/> After declining an invitation to visit James Turner Street, Deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]], leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]] said that he believed both left and right arguments on welfare were wrong. "We want a welfare system which is compassionate."<ref name=Guardian-2014-01-22/> Shortly after Clegg's comments, Birmingham councillor Desmond Jaddoo told the ''Birmingham Mail'' that he had compiled letters to Clegg, Cameron and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Ed Miliband]] on behalf of some James Turner Street residents inviting them to visit the street and asking for help to find employment.<ref name=Birmingham-Mail-2014-01-23/>

Writing for the ''[[Gazette and Herald|Wiltshire Gazette and Herald]]'', the Liberal Democrat MP [[Duncan Hames]] argued the programme would contribute little to the subject: "We do need to have a rational, informed debate about how to improve our welfare system, but the editorial line taken by supposedly factual <U+2018>reality TV<U+2019> adds very little to that."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazetteandherald.co.uk/news/10957620.Duncan_Hames__MP_for_Chippenham______Reality_TV____does_nothing_for_those_wanting_to_work/?ref=var_0 |title=Duncan Hames, MP for Chippenham <U+2013> <U+2018>Reality TV<U+2019> does nothing for those wanting to work |newspaper=The Wiltshire Gazette and Herald |publisher=Newsquest |date=23 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> The programme was condemned by the current Ladywood MP, Labour's [[Shabana Mahmood]]: "I found it shocking that Channel 4 or any other organisation would present poverty as entertainment. It was profoundly wrong."<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan |last=Walker |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/channel-4-show-benefits-street-6482174 |title=Channel 4 show Benefits Street exploits the poor, says Birmingham MP |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Birmingham Post |date=9 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> In the ''[[Radio Times]]'', [[Clare Short]], who represented the constituency prior to Mahmood, said the series was "totally unrepresentative" of the area, and condemned it as "crummy and misleading".<ref name=Guardian-2014-02-04>{{cite news|first=Caroline |title=Davies |url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/04/benefits-street-channel-four-clare-short |title=Benefits Street is excuse for viewers to judge and sneer, says Clare Short |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jefferies |first=Mark |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/benefits-street-channel-4-series-3109953 |title=Benefits Street: Channel 4 series is "totally unrepresentative" of the area, says former Labour MP Clare Short |newspaper=Daily Mirror |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref> Others have also criticised ''Benefits Street'', arguing it does not present a balanced view of the subject. Labour MP [[Anne Begg]], chair of the Commons [[Work and Pensions Select Committee]], said that the programme was a "misrepresentation" of people claiming benefits, arguing that it focused on those claiming unemployment benefits which makes up a small proportion of the overall welfare bill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jan/10/benefits-street-misrepresentation-welfare-mp-begg-channel-4 |title=Benefits Street is a 'misrepresentation' of life on welfare, says MP |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> Referring to the first episode that featured a shoplifter, [[Chris Williamson (politician)|Chris Williamson]] (also a Labour MP) said it was "irresponsible" to portray him as a typical benefits claimant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/TV-s-Benefits-Street-blasted-irresponsible-Derby/story-20468612-detail/story.html |title=Channel 4's Benefits Street blasted as 'irresponsible' by Derby Labour MP |publisher= |newspaper=Derby Telegraph |date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]], a columnist for ''[[The Independent]]'' described the series as "medieval stocks updated for a modern format".<ref>{{cite news|first= Jessica |last=Elgot |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/10/benefits-street-owen-jone_n_4573811.html |title=Owen Jones Tears Into Channel 4's Ralph Lee Over Benefits Street On Newsnight |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> In an article for the ''Birmingham Mail'', writer and television personality [[Samantha Brick]], a native of Birmingham, said that the series was an "atrociously unbalanced" view of the city.<ref>{{cite news|first=Christina |last=Savvas |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/samantha-brick-defends-birmingham-after-6679179 |title=Samantha Brick defends Birmingham after Benefits Street - "We're not all on the take and Channel 4 twisted show' |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Shadow Welfare Minister [[Chris Bryant]] claimed that the residents of [[The Bishop's Avenue]] in [[Hampstead]]{{mdash}}known as Billionaire's Row because of its expensive properties{{mdash}}were as likely to have drink and drugs problems as the residents of James Turner Street.<ref>{{cite news|first=Kashmira |last=Gander |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/billionaires-row-residents-are-as-likely-to-be-drug-addicts-as-people-on-benefits-street-says-labour-mp-chris-bryant-9137080.html |title=As many drug addicts on Billionaire's Row as Benefits Street, says Labour MP Chris Bryant |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=18 February 2014 |accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref>

[[Fraser Nelson]], editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'', suggested the programme had highlighted a section of society who have been forgotten by the politicians: "These people are people who otherwise don<U+2019>t have a voice. They don<U+2019>t vote, so for many years they have just not mattered".<ref>{{cite news|first=Fraser |last=Nelson |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10579987/Benefits-Street-the-real-scandal.html |title=Benefits Street: the real scandal |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 January 2014 |accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> Nelson's comments were echoed by [[Dominic Sandbrook]] in the ''Daily Mail'', who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people <U+2013> through no fault of their own <U+2013> to a life without hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State."<ref name=Mail-2014-01-18>{{cite news|first=Dominic |last=Sandbrook |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541568/No-Benefits-Street-does-NOT-demonise-poor-But-shows-immoral-let-welfare-pay-working.html |title=No, Benefits Street does NOT demonise the poor.

====''Benefits Britain: The Debate''====
A live one-hour debate was scheduled to be broadcast by Channel 4 following the final episode of ''Benefits Street''.

Channel 4 said ''Benefits Britain: The Debate'' would be immediately preceded by a follow up documentary, ''Benefits Street: The Last Word''. The change was announced after many listings magazines had gone to press, a practice generally discouraged in the media industry.<ref name=Guardian-2014-02-06>{{cite news|first=Jason |last=Deans |url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/feb/06/benefits-street-channel-4-moves-debate-show |title=Benefits Street: Channel 4 moves live debate show back a week |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref>

===Critical reception===

Several James Turner Street residents have claimed they were tricked into appearing in the series by Love Productions, who they say told them it would be about community spirit. One resident told the ''[[Birmingham Mail]]'', "They told me it was about living as a community and how we all got along. But the actual programme doesn't show any of that. If they had said it was about benefits and making the street look bad I would not have taken part. They tricked us."<ref name=Birmingham-Mail-2014-01-06/> Responding to allegations the residents were duped, Nick Mirsky said that Love Productions had spent much time consulting the residents before filming began, and that process continued afterwards: "Key contributors have been offered viewings of the programmes during the editing period and were given the opportunity to comment on them. Both Love and Channel 4 listened to any concerns raised, and in some cases made changes to the programme to accommodate them."<ref name=Guardian-2014-01-10/> Dierdre Kelly, however, subsequently told ITV's ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'' that she believed the programme had provided a one-sided view of her community, and that the residents "went into the show naively".<ref>{{cite news|last=Wightman |first=Catriona |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a552386/benefits-streets-white-dee-we-went-into-the-show-naively.html |title=Benefits Street's White Dee: 'We went into the show naively' |publisher=Digital Spy |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=19 February 2014}}</ref> Gareth Price of ''The Guardian'' suggested the show's producers "adeptly edited their film in order to provoke a response from its intended audience".<ref>{{cite news|last=Price |first=Garreth |url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/22/benefits-street-tv-programme-divided-the-nation |title=Decoding Benefits Street: how Britain was divided by a television show |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 February 2014 |accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>

Sources including ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' reported that several commentators had accused Channel 4 of making "poverty porn".<ref name=Independent-2014-01-07/><ref name=Broadcast-2014-01-10/> In response, Ralph Lee refuted those accusations during a debate on the 9 January edition of [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme: "It<U+2019>s inaccurate and it<U+2019>s patronising towards the people that take part in these programmes and open up their lives, and it<U+2019>s quite offensive to the people who make them."<ref name=Broadcast-2014-01-10>{{cite news|last=Kanter |first=Jake |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/c4-rejects-benefits-streets-poverty-porn-tag/5065238.article |title=C4 rejects Benefits Street's <U+2018>poverty porn<U+2019> tag |work=Broadcast |publisher= |date=10 January 2014 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> Mirsky claimed the reaction to ''Benefits Street'' demonstrated how it had "touched a nerve" and subsequently proved it was "essential" the series was made.<ref>{{cite news|first=Mayer |last=Missim |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a543613/benefits-street-protest-takes-place-at-love-productions-london-offices.html |title=Benefits Street protest takes place at Love Productions London offices |publisher=Digital Spy |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> The boss of Love Productions, Richard McKerrow, also defended the series, saying it was not about "demonising the poor...It<U+2019>s a very honest and true portrayal of life in Britain and people are frightened of it."<ref name=Mirror-2014-01-13>{{cite news|last=McTague |first=Tom |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/benefits-street-iain-duncan-smith-3019449 |title=Benefits Street: Iain Duncan Smith uses poverty porn show to justify savage Tory welfare cuts |newspaper=Daily Mirror |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> Writing as the series concluded, ''The Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s Neil Midgley felt that ''Benefits Street'' had not exploited its participants, and was "definitely the kind of series that Channel 4 should be making: easy to grasp and innovative, and yet a blinding revelation of some ills that are at the heart of modern Britain."<ref name=Telegraph-2014-02-10/>

Emma Johnson, the head teacher of the Oasis school, organised a public meeting on the evening of 15 January to discuss issues raised by the programme.<ref>{{cite news|last=Elkes |first=Neil |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/benefits-street-school-leads-fightback-3016942 |title=Benefits Street school leads fightback for community 'demonised' by controversial Channel 4 show |newspaper=Daily Mirror |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref> The event was attended by around 100 residents from the area. BBC journalist David Lumb said reporters were not allowed to take pictures, and those present felt the occasion was "an opportunity to preach a political agenda".<ref name=BBC-2014-01-16/> The meeting was told that an employed couple who were filmed for the series were dropped from the final version. Love Productions said this was because the show was about people on benefits, and one of the unnamed pair was a benefits officer.<ref name=BBC-2014-01-16>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-25750475 |work=BBC News |title=Benefits Street: Working couple 'cut' from Channel 4 show |publisher=BBC |date=16 January 2014 |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>

After the third episode was televised on 20 January, the ''Daily Mail'' reported that community leaders and residents had accused Channel 4 of exploiting children, claiming it had led to the children featured in the documentary becoming targets for bullying. In response, a Channel 4 spokeswoman said that consent from parents and guardians, and the children themselves was obtained before filming began "in accordance with the relevant sections of the Ofcom broadcasting code.

The ''Birmingham Mail'' reported on 10 February that figures released to the newspaper by [[Birmingham City Council]]'s fraud investigation service indicated instances of benefit fraud in the city were lower than had been suggested by the documentary, with   851 prosecutions in the five years preceding 2014, an average of 0.5% of total benefit claimants. Furthermore, of the 152,000 housing benefit claimants in Birmingham, 178 were prosecuted for fraudulent claims in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick |last=McCarthy |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/benefits-street-truth-benefit-fraud-6689371 |title=Benefits Street: The truth about benefit fraud in Birmingham |publisher=Trinity Mirror |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref>
