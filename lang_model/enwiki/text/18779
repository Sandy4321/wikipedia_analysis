{{Culture of Scotland}}
The '''architecture of Scotland''' includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, from the [[Neolithic]] era to the present day. The earliest surviving houses go back around 9500 years, and the first villages 6000 years: [[Skara Brae]] on the [[Mainland, Orkney|Mainland]] of [[Orkney]] being the earliest preserved example in Europe. [[Crannog]]s, roundhouses, each built on an artificial island, date from the [[Bronze Age]] and stone buildings called [[Atlantic roundhouse]]s and larger earthwork [[hill forts]] from the [[Iron Age]]. The arrival of the Romans from about 71 AD led to the creation of forts like that at [[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]], and a continuous fortification between the [[Firth of Forth]] and the [[Firth of Clyde]] known as the [[Antonine Wall]], built in the second century AD. Beyond Roman influence, there is evidence of [[wheelhouse (archaeology)|wheelhouses]] and underground [[souterrain]]s. After the departure of the Romans there were a series of nucleated hill forts, often utilising major geographical features, as at [[Dunadd]] and [[Dumbarton Castle|Dunbarton]].

Castles arrived in Scotland with the introduction of [[feudalism]] in the twelfth century. Initially these were wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] constructions, but many were replaced by stone castles with a high curtain wall. In the late Middle Ages new castles were built, some on a grander scale, and others, particularly in the borders, simpler [[tower house]]s. Gunpowder weaponry led to the use of gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls adapted to resist bombardment. Medieval parish church architecture was typically simpler than in England, but there were grander ecclesiastical buildings in the Gothic style. From the early fifteenth century the introduction of Renaissance styles included the selective use of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] forms in church architecture, as in the nave of [[Dunkeld Cathedral]], followed more directly influenced Renaissance palace building from the late fifteenth century, beginning at [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]]. The private houses of aristocrats adopted some of these features and incorporated features of Medieval castles and tower houses into plans based on the French Ch<U+00E2>teau to produce the [[Scots Baronial]] style. From about 1560, the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] led to the widespread destruction of church furnishings, ornaments and decoration and in post-Reformation period a unique form of church emerged based on the "T"-shaped plan. 

After the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]] in 1660, there was a fashion for grand private houses influenced by the [[Palladian]] style and associated with the architects [[Sir William Bruce, 1st Baronet, of Balcaskie|Sir William Bruce]] and [[James Smith (architect)|James Smith]]. Scotland produced some of the most significant British architects of the eighteenth century, including: [[Colen Campbell]], [[James Gibbs]], [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] and particularly [[Robert Adam]]. They looked to classical models and [[Edinburgh]]'s [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] was the focus of a classical building boom. The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Scottish towns, leading to urban sprawl, exemplified by tenements like those of the [[Gorbals]] in Glasgow. [[New town]]s, of designed communities like [[New Lanark]], developed from 1800 by [[Robert Owen]], were one solution. Sociologist [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854<U+2013>1932) preferred "conservative surgery": retaining the best buildings in an area and removing the worst. There was a revival of the baronial style, particularly after the rebuilding of [[Abbotsford House]] for [[Walter Scott]] from 1816, and a parallel revival of the Gothic in church architecture. Neoclassicism was pursued by [[William Henry Playfair]], [[Alexander 'Greek' Thomson]] and [[David Rhind]]. The late nineteenth century saw some major engineering projects including the [[Forth Bridge]], a [[cantilever bridge]] and one of the first major all steel constructions in the world. 

The most significant Scottish architect of the early twentieth century, [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], developed a unique and internationally influential "Glasgow style". Architects who continued to employ styles informed by the past included [[James Robert Rhind]] and [[James Miller (architect)|James Miller]]. From the mid-twentieth century, architecture in Scotland became increasingly utilitarian and influenced by modernism. Key Scottish architects in this movement included [[Thomas S. Tait]], [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] and James Gowan. The introduction of [[brutalist|brutalism]] led to urban clearances and extensive use of the tower block. The style was also used in new towns like [[Glenrothes]] and [[Cumbernauld]], but has received considerable criticism. More recent major architectural projects include the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]], Glasgow, the many striking modern buildings along the side of the River Clyde and the [[Scottish Parliament Building]] in Edinburgh.

The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 AD. In the summer of AD 78 [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] arrived in Britain to take up his appointment as the new governor and began a series of expeditions to Scotland. Two years later his legions constructed a substantial [[Roman fort|fort]] at [[Trimontium (Newstead)|Trimontium]] near [[Melrose, Scottish Borders|Melrose]]. He is said to have pushed his armies to the estuary of the "River Taus" (usually assumed to be the [[River Tay]]) and established forts there, including a legionary fortress at [[Inchtuthil]]. Agricola's  successors were unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within the space of a few years.<ref>A.

Around 141 A.D. the Romans undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new ''limes'' between the Firth of Forth and the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The [[Antonine Wall]] is the largest Roman construction inside Scotland. It is a [[wikt:sward|sward]]-covered wall made of [[Sod|turf]] circa 7&nbsp;metres (20&nbsp;ft) high, with nineteen forts. It extended for {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Medieval [[vernacular architecture]] made use of local materials and styles. As in England, [[cruck]] construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof, however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf to fill in the walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and stray, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof.<ref>R. W. Brunskill, ''Houses and Cottages of Britain'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), ISBN 0575071222, pp. 235-40.</ref> With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction.

Early [[Romanesque]] [[ashlar]] masonry produced block-built stone buildings, like the eleventh century [[Irish round tower|round tower]] at [[Brechin Cathedral]] and the square towers of [[Dunblane Cathedral]] and [[St Andrews Cathedral|The Church of St Rule]].<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3/> After the eleventh century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectilinear, resulting in structurally more stable stable walls that were could incorporate more refined architectural moulding and detailing that can be seen in [[corbel]]ling, [[buttress]]ing, [[lintel]]s and [[arch]]ing. At the same time there was increasing influences from English and continental European designs, such as the Romanesque chevron pattern detailing on the piers in the nave of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] (1130<U+2013>40), which were modelled on details from [[Durham Cathedral]], and the thirteenth century East-end of [[Elgin Cathedral]], which incorporated typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery.<ref name=Maxwell2005pp22-3/> In the fifteenth century continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland.

Scotland is known for its dramatically placed castles, many of which date from the late medieval era. Castles, in the sense of a fortified residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands.<ref name=Simpson&Webster2003p225>G.

[[File:Am linlithgow palace north west.jpg|thumb|left|[[Linlithgow Palace]], the first building to bear that title in Scotland, extensively rebuilt along Renaissance principles from the fifteenth century.]]
The impact of the Renaissance on Scottish architecture has been seen as occurring in two distinct phases. First, from the early fifteenth century the selective use of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] forms in church architecture, to be followed by a second phase of more directly influenced Renaissance palace building from the late fifteenth century.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996pp3-4/> The re-adoption of low-massive church building with round arches and pillars, in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly [[English Gothic architecture|dominant in England]] in the late Medieval era, may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands, and may have been a conscious reaction to English forms in favour of continental ones. It can be seen in the nave of [[Dunkeld Cathedral]], begun in 1406, the facade of [[St Mary's Collegiate Church, Haddington|St Mary's, Haddington]] from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's [[Kings College, Aberdeen]] (1500-9).<ref name=Glendinningetal1996pp3-4>M.

The extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under [[James III of Scotland|James III]], accelerated under [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], reaching its peak under [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. These works have been seen as directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. [[Linlithgow Palace|Linlithgow]] was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace of a ''palatium ad moden castri'' (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery.

[[File:Burntisland Parish Kirk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burntisland]] Parish Kirk]]
From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church architecture in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship, with no need for elaborate buildings divided up by ritual, resulting in the widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration.<ref name=BritScot2>{{citation|url=http://www.architecture.com/HowWeBuiltBritain/HistoricalPeriods/Scottish/KirksThroughoutTheAges/Introduction.aspx |publisher=architecture.com |title=Kirks throughout the ages |author=Royal Institute of British Architects |authorlink=Royal Institute of British Architects |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> There was a need to adapt and build new churches suitable for reformed services, particularly putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship. Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century, as at [[Dunnottar Castle]] in the 1580s, [[Greenock]] (1591) and [[Durness]] (1619),<ref name=Spicer2000p517>A.

There were continuities with pre-Reformation materials, with some churches using rubble, as at [[Kemback]] in Fife (1582). Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at [[Burntisland]] (1592).<ref>A. Spicer, ''Calvinist Churches in Early Modern Europe'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2007), ISBN 0719054877, pp. 53 and 57.</ref> The church of [[Greyfriars Kirk|Greyfriars, Edinburgh]], built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at [[Dirleton]] (1612), had a more sophisticated classical style. A variation of the rectangular church that developed in post-Reformation Scotland was the "T"-shaped plan, often used when adapting existing churches, which allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit. They can be seen at Kemback and [[Prestonpans]] after 1595. It continued to be used into the seventeenth century as at [[Weem]] (1600), [[Anstruther Easter]], Fife (1634<U+2013>44) and [[New Cumnock]] (1657). In the seventeenth century a [[Greek cross]] plan was used for churches such as [[Cawdor]] (1619) and [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]] (1643). In most of these cases one arm of the cross would have been closed off as a laird's aisle, meaning that they were in effect "T"-plan churches.<ref name=Spicer2000p517/>

[[File:Heriot Hospital court.jpg|thumb|left|The seventeenth century quadrangle of [[Heriot's Hospital]], Edinburgh, showing many of the key features of the Scots baronial style.]]
The unique style of great private house in Scotland, later known as [[Scots baronial]], has been located in origin to the period of the 1560s. It kept many of the features of the high walled Medieval castles that had been largely made obsolete by gunpowder weapons and may have been influenced by the French masons brought to Scotland to work on royal palaces. It drew on the tower houses and peel towers,<ref name=Summerson1993pp502-11>J.

Particularly influential was the work of [[William Wallace (mason)|William Wallace]], the king's master mason from 1617 until his death in 1631. He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618, [[Winton House]] for George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on [[Heriot's Hospital]], Edinburgh. He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan like that used at [[Ch<U+00E2>teau d'Ancy-le-Franc]]. This style can be seen in lords houses built at [[Caerlaverock Castle|Caerlaverlock]] (1620), [[Moray House]], Edinburgh (1628) and [[Drumlanrig Castle]] (1675<U+2013>89), and was highly influential until the baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with [[Inigo Jones]] in the later seventeenth century.<ref name=Summerson1993pp502-11/>{{clear}}

After the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]], growing prosperity in Scotland led to a spate of new building, both public and private. The threat of Jacobite insurrection or invasion meant that Scotland also saw more military building than England in this period, relying on the strength of inclined and angled engineered masonry work combined
with the ability of earthen toppings that could deflect and absorb artillery fire. This culminated in the construction of [[Fort George, Scotland|Fort George]], near Inverness (1748<U+2013>69), with its projecting [[bastion]]s and [[redoubt]]s.<ref>I.

Often built by groups of friends and family, the homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction. Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. Urban settings also included traditional thatched houses, beside the larger, stone and slate roofed town houses of merchants and urban gentry.<ref name=McKean2010pp55-6/> The Industrial Revolution transformed the scale of Scottish towns, making Glasgow the "second city of the Empire".<ref>J.

The sometimes [[utopianism|utopian]] concept of the [[new town]], aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, was an important part of Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth to the twentieth century.

[[Inveraray Castle]], constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam displays the incorporation of turrets. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style. Robert Adam's houses in this style include [[Mellerstain]] and [[Wedderburn Castle|Wedderburn]] in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at [[Culzean Castle]], Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777.<ref>I.

Important for the adoption of the style in the early nineteenth century was [[Abbotsford House]], the residence the novelist and poet, Sir [[Walter Scott]]. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth and seventeenth century houses included [[battlements|battlemented]] gateways, [[crow-stepped gable]]s, pointed [[turrets]] and [[machicolations]].

In ecclesiastical architecture, a style with more in common to that in England was adopted. Important figures included [[Frederick Thomas Pilkington]] (1832<U+2013>98), who developed a new style of church building which accorded with the fashionable [[Gothic Revival architecture|High Gothic]], but which adapted it for the worship needs of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], as at [[Barclay Viewforth Church]], Edinburgh (1862-4).<ref name=Stamp1995pp108-10>G.

By 1880 his practice was designing some of the most prestigious public and private buildings in Scotland, such as  the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, [[Edinburgh University]]; the [[Central Hotel (Glasgow)|Central Hotel]] at [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central station]], the [[Catholic Apostolic Church]] in Edinburgh and [[Mount Stuart House]] on the Isle of Bute.<ref name=Glendinningetal1996p552>M.

===Neo-classicism===
{{See also|Neoclassicism}}
[[File:Caledonia Road Church.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Alexander Thomson]]'s Caledonia Road Church, Glasgow]]
Neoclassicism continued to be a major style into the nineteenth century. [[William Henry Playfair]] (1790<U+2013>1857) was the designer of many of Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] and the [[Royal Scottish Academy Building|Royal Scottish Academy]], which are situated in the centre of [[Edinburgh]]. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was [[Alexander 'Greek' Thomson]] (1817<U+2013>75). Working mainly in Glasgow, he turned away from the Gothic style toward that of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, as can be seen in the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).<ref name=Stamp1995pp108-10/>

[[David Rhind]] (1808<U+2013>83) employed both neoclassical and Baronial styles and worked included many branches of the [[Commercial Bank of Scotland]], including their headquarters in Edinburgh.<ref>[http://hsewsf.sedsh.gov.uk/hslive/hsstart?P_HBNUM=28862 "14 George Street, Former Commercial Bank, Listed Building Report"], ''Historic Scotland'', retrieved 11 May 2012.</ref> He also designed a number of churches, local government buildings, and houses. One of his grandest schemes was Daniel Stewart's Hospital, now [[Stewart's Melville College]], Edinburgh. In 1849, he was commissioned to design the lay-out of the [[Pollokshields]] area of [[Glasgow]], in what until then had been farmland {{convert|2|mi}} south of the city centre.<ref>[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100331 "David Rhind: Biography"], ''Dictionary of Scottish Architects from 1903'', retrieved 11 May 2012.</ref> Rhind formed a partnership with [[Robert Hamilton Paterson]] (1843<U+2013>1911) who executed major works for brewers, malters and warehouse-men (for which Edinburgh was a centre), including design of the Abbey, James Calder & Co., Castle, Holyrood, Drybrough's, [[Caledonian Brewery|Caledonian]] and Clydesdale Breweries; and also work for [[McVitie's|McVitie and Price]].<ref>[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=100340 "Robert Hamilton Paterson: Biography"], ''Dictionary of Scottish Architects from 1903'', retrieved 20 July 2011.</ref> The partnership was to execute important projects such as the Queen Victoria Memorial at Liverpool<ref>[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=205917 "Building and Design Report <U+2013> Queen Victoria Memorial, Liverpool"], ''Dictionary of Scottish Architects from 1903'', retrieved 20 July 2011.</ref> and the Royal Scots War Memorial in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh.<ref>[http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/building_full.php?id=101378  Building and Design Report <U+2013> St. Giles Cathedral, Royal Scots War Memorial], ''Dictionary of Scottish Architects from 1903'', retrieved 20 July 2011.</ref>

===New engineering===
The nineteenth century saw some major engineering projects including [[Thomas Telford]]'s stone [[Dean Bridge]] and iron [[Craigellachie Bridge]].<ref>C. Harvie, ''Scotland: A Short History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), ISBN 0-19-210054-8, p. 133.</ref> The most important was the [[Forth Bridge]], a [[cantilever bridge|cantilever]] railway bridge over the [[Firth of Forth]] in the east of [[Scotland]], 14&nbsp;kilometres (9&nbsp;mi) west of central [[Edinburgh]].

==Twentieth century to the present==
{{See also|Modern architecture}}
[[Image:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Glasgow School of Art]], often considered the greatest designs of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]].]] 
The most significant Scottish architect of the early twentieth century, having a considerable influence on European architecture, was [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (1868<U+2013>1928). He mixed elements of the Scots baronial, [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the [[Art Nouveau]] to produce elegant modern buildings. His major work included the [[The Willow Tearooms]] in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow (1903), [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897<U+2013>1909) and [[Hill House, Helensburgh]] (1902<U+2013>04).<ref>A. L. Palmer, ''The A to Z of Architecture'' (Scarecrow Press, 2009), ISBN 0-8108-6895-4, p. 34.</ref> The influence of Mackintosh's Glasgow style can be seen in the work of architects like [[James Salmon (1873-1924)|James Salmon]] (1873<U+2013>1924), whose designs included the heavily glass-fronted, Art Nouveau "Hatrack" (1899<U+2013>1902) on Vincent Street and the Lion Chambers, Hope Street (1904<U+2013>05), an early example of [[reinforced concrete]] construction.<ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&MacKechniep368>M.

MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day'', (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), ISBN 978-0-7486-0849-2, p. 368.</ref>

In the twentieth century the distinctive Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as [[Portland cement]], concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals.<ref>I. Maxwell, ''A History of Scotland<U+2019>s Masonry Construction'' in P. Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), ISBN 1-904320-02-3, p. 29.</ref> In the twentieth century private architecture was increasingly client driven.<ref name=Gardiner2005p173/> [[James Robert Rhind]], (1854<U+2013>1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following [[Andrew Carnegie]]'s gift of <U+00A3>100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of [[Edwardian Baroque architecture]]. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features.<ref>[http://www.scotcities.com/carnegie/baroque.htm "Baroque libraries in Glasgow"], ''Carnegie Libraries of Scotland'', retrieved 11 May 2012.</ref> [[James Miller (architect)|James Miller]] (1860<U+2013>1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901<U+2013>05 extensions to [[Glasgow Central railway station]],<ref>E. Williamson, A. Riches and M. Higgs, ''Glasgow'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1990), ISBN 0-14-071069-8, p. 97.</ref> and the spectacular [[Wemyss Bay railway station]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]].<ref>F. A.

After the First World War, Miller and his chief designer Richard Gunn (1889<U+2013>1933) along with others, adapted to the growing needs of the office block. In Glasgow, with its central gridiron plan, this followed the practice in the United States of filling up entire blocks and building steel framed buildings as high as the fire marshal would allow, as in the heavily American-influenced [[Union Bank of Scotland|Union Bank]] building (1924) at St Vincent Street.<ref name=GlendinningMacInnes&MacKechniep395>M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, ''A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), ISBN 978-0-7486-0849-2, p. 395.</ref> From the mid-twentieth century, public architecture became more utilitarian, as part of the impulse to produce a comprehensive [[welfare state]].<ref name=Gardiner2005p173/> [[Thomas S. Tait]] (1882<U+2013>1954) was among the most important modernist architects of the era, using pyramidal stepped designs for buildings like the [[St Andrew's House]], Edinburgh, (1935-9) built for the Scottish Office, and the 1939 "Tower of Empire" for the [[Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938]], held in [[Bellahouston Park]].<ref name=Gardiner2005p173>M. Gardiner, ''Modern Scottish Culture'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), ISBN 0-7486-2027-3, p. 173.</ref> 

During World War I the government became increasingly aware of Scotland's housing problems, particularly after the Glasgow rent strike of 1915. A royal commission of 1917 reported on the "unspeakably filthy privy-[[middens]] in many of the mining areas, badly constructed incurably damp labourers' cottages on farms, whole townships unfit for human occupation in the crofting counties and islands&nbsp;... groups of lightless and unventilated houses in the older burghs, clotted masses of slums in the great cities".<ref name=McIntoshGray&Moffat1999pp70-1>A. McIntosh Gray and W. Moffat, ''A History of Scotland: Modern Times'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), ISBN 0-19-917063-0, pp.&nbsp;70<U+2013>1.</ref> The result was a massive programme of council house building. Many early council houses were built on greenfield sites away from the pollution of the city, often constructed of semi-detached homes or terraced cottages. [[Knightswood]], north-west of Glasgow, was built as a show piece from 1923-9, with a library, social centre and seven shopping "parades". In the 1930s schemes tended to be more cheaply built, like [[Blackhill, Glasgow]], with a thousand houses built as two and three story tenements. These building schemes were designed to rehouse those displaced by urban slum clearance, by which thousands of tenements were demolished. However, often crammed into poor land near railways or gasworks, they soon became notorious. A survey of 1936 found that almost half of Scotland's houses were still inadequate.<ref name=McIntoshGray&Moffat1999pp70-1/> 

[[File:Merchant City, Glasgow 020.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The revitalised [[Merchant City]], Glasgow]]
In the post-war period Scotland continued to produce important architects, including [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] (1926<U+2013>92), who with James Gowan (1923-) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955-8), considered a landmark in the development of modernist, [[brutalist]] residential planning, which would have a profound impact in Scotland.<ref>H. F. Mallgrave, ''Modern Architectural Theory: A Historical Survey, 1673<U+2013>1968'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), ISBN 0-521-79306-8, p. 353.</ref> Their later work, almost all of it outside of Scotland, would be highly influential on an international scale.<ref>G. H. Baker, ''The Architecture of James Stirling and His Partners James Gowan and Michael Wilford: A Study of Architectural Creativity in the Twentieth Century'' (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2011), ISBN 1-4094-0926-0.</ref> The post-war desire for urban regeneration would focus on the [[tower block]], championed in Glasgow by [[David Gibson (UK politician)|David Gibson]], convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road Flats]] originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape form the overcrowded nineteenth century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. [[Robert Matthew]] (1906<U+2013>75) and [[Basil Spence]] (1907<U+2013>76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow, for demolitions at the University of Edinburgh and the stark rebuilding typified by the David Hume Tower (1960<U+2013>63).<ref name=Gardiner2005p173/> Another solution adopted in Scotland was the building of new towns like [[Glenrothes]] (1948) and [[Cumbernauld]] (1956), designed to take excess population from the cities.<ref name=FryFryFry1990p203-4/> Cumbernauld was praised for its architecture when first built, but the uncompleted centre and the layout of the town in general, were receiving heavy criticism by the twenty-first century: its modernist architecture described by one resident as "the lego fantasy of an unhappy child".<ref>A. Alexander, ''Britain's New Towns: Garden Cities to Sustainable Communities'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 2009), ISBN 0-415-47513-9, p. 117.</ref>

From the 1980s Scottish architecture began to recover its reputation with works such as the building to house the [[Burrell Collection]] in Glasgow (1981).<ref name=Wilson&Murphy2008p51/> Recent major public buildings include the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]], Glasgow (1997), designed by [[Norman Foster]] (1935-) and known for its segmented, curving roof as "the Armadillo",<ref>A. Murphy and R. Ford, ''Footprint Glasgow Handbook: The Travel Guide'' (Footprint Travel Guides, 2002), ISBN 1-903471-24-9, p. 118.</ref> and the many striking modern buildings along the side of the River Clyde,<ref name=Wilson&Murphy2008p51>N.

C. Theokas, ''Grounds for Review: The Garden Festival in Urban Planning and Design'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2004), ISBN 0-85323-539-2, p. 173.</ref> The most important building of the early twentieth century is the [[Scottish Parliament Building]] in Edinburgh, designed by [[Enric Miralles]] (1955<U+2013>2000) and opened in 2004, with a design that recalls upturned fishing boats.<ref>J. Myerson and P. Ross, ''Space to Work: New Office Design'' (London: Laurence King, 2006), ISBN 1-85669-456-9, p. 94.</ref> There have been increasing attempts to preserve much of what survives from Scotland's architectural heritage, including the great buildings and monuments, but also the classically influenced houses of towns like Edinburgh and Glasgow<ref name=Wilson2005p5/> and the surviving tenements, many of which have been renovated, restored to their original pink and honeyed sandstone from the black fronts created by pollution<ref>D. Howard, ed., ''William Adam, Volume 1'', Volume 17 of ''The Journal of the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1990), ISBN 0748602321, p. 112.</ref> and brought up to modern standards of accommodation.<ref name=Brunskill2000pp234-5/> Urban regeneration has also been attempted in areas of post-industrial decline, like the [[Merchant City]] in Glasgow, which was returned to housing from the 1980s, with warehouse loft conversions<ref>M.
