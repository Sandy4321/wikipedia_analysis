'''Rom<U+00E1>n Baldorioty de Castro''' ([[February 23]], [[1822]] &ndash; [[September 30]], [[1889]]), distinguished himself as one of [[Puerto Rico]]'s foremost [[abolitionist]]s and spokesman for the island's right to [[self-determination]].  He received his primary and secondary education in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] and after completing his elementary education, received a scholarship and moved to [[Spain]], where he continued his studies at the [[University of Madrid]]. In 1853, he returned to Puerto Rico and began working as a professor at the island's School of Commerce and the ''Seminario Concilar''. Baldorioty de Castro was selected to represent Puerto Rico at the 1867 Universal Fair, which was organized in [[Paris, France]]. In 1870, he was elected as a deputy in the [[Spanish Parliament]] where he promoted abolition of slavery. Baldorioty de Castro founded the ''Partido Autonomista'' in 1887, but he was only able to work within it for a few months before being imprisoned in [[Fort San Felipe del Morro]], after being accused of publishing [[propaganda]] that affected the Spanish government's image. He was released after a brief period in jail, but his time in prison affected his health, which contributed to his death on [[September 30]], [[1889]].

==Early years==

Baldorioty de Castro was born in [[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico|Guaynabo]] to a poor family.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=35}}</ref> His family moved to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] when he was young, where he received his primary education as a student of the noted educator, [[Rafael Cordero (educator)|Rafael Cordero]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.guaynabocity.gov.pr/Guaynabo/My+Guaynabo/Leaders/Roman+Baldorioty+de+Castro.htm| title=L<U+00ED>deres: Rom<U+00E1>n Baldorioty de Castro| publisher= Municipio Aut<U+00F3>nomo de Guaynabo| language=Spanish| accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref> After completing his elementary education, he enrolled in ''El Seminario Conciliar de Idelfonso'', which at that time was the most organized institution in Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=48}}</ref> He spent most of his adolescent years studying and finished with one of the best averages in his class. Following this, Baldorioty de Castro was granted a [[scholarship]], which he used for his studies in Spain. He then collected the money necessary to travel and departed to Spain in the company of three fellow Puerto Ricans, two students and a professor.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=23}}</ref> Before establishing a permanent residence in [[Madrid]], the group traveled to several Spanish provinces, where they visited some of the country's tourist sites. Among the places visited were locations in [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Seville]], [[And<U+00FA>jar]] and [[Bail<U+00E9>n]] where they met [[Alberto Lista]], one of Spain's most renowned educators.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=25}}</ref> The three other students (who traveled with Baldorioty de Castor) contracted [[Smallpox]], shortly after beginning their academic studies in the [[Complutense University of Madrid#central|Central University of Madrid]].  Baldorioty de Castro provided them with medical attention, however two of them died from complications of the disease.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=48-49}}</ref> Baldorioty de Castro was given an offer to return to Puerto Rico which he declined. He continued his studies along with the only survivor and graduated with a degree in [[Physics]] and [[Mathematical Sciences]] from the university. In 1847 the ''[[Sociedad Econ<U+00F3>mica de los Amigos del Pa<U+00ED>s|Sociedad de Amigos del Pa<U+00ED>s de Puerto Rico]]'' named Baldorioty the organization's correspondent in Spain.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A.

==Political career==
[[Image:Bust of Baldorioty de Castro.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Bust of Baldorioty de Castro]]
In 1853, after seven years of absence, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico and married Isabel Matilde D<U+00ED>az y Ruiz, the granddaughter of [[Jose and Francisco Diaz|Lieutenent Francisco Diaz]], hero of the Battle of San Juan of 1797.<ref>[http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/churchmews/1216/ParticipantesAcciones1797.html Algunos de los participantes en las acciones ocurridas durante la invasi<U+00F3>n brit<U+00E1>nica de 1797]</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=37}}</ref> Upon his return, he noticed that there was political tension, because of the differences between the governor in office and the  political and educational groups in Puerto Rico. Baldorioty de Castro then began promoting the restructuring of the social, political and educational establishements.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=51}}</ref> These contributions led to Fernando Norzagaray, the colony's incumbent governor to offer him the position of mayor of one of the island's municipalities (towns). Baldorioty de Castro declined the offer, based on his ideals. At the moment, the government displayed no interest in promoting  education among the Criollos of the island.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=42}}</ref> Two years earlier, the governor had imposed the ''Reglamento del Jornalero'', which promoted a more ample labor base by reducing the amount of unemployed citizens. However, the establishment of this measure created criticism when some of the proposal's aspects were used to increase the wealth of employers.<ref name="cuarenta y tres">{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=43}}</ref> As a consequence, the law's status was reconsidered and a group led by Baldorioty de Castro was selected to decide its validity.<ref name="cuarenta y tres"/> In 1853, he became a member of the Liberal Reform Party of Puerto Rico.  Besides politics, Baldorioty de Castro also loved teaching. He taught Botany and Maritime Sciences at the School of Commerce, Agriculture and Maritime Studies in San Juan.

On January 1854, the Councilor Seminar named Baldorioty de Castro the institution's botany professor. On November of that year, Puerto Rico's Commerce and Foment Joint selected him to be work as a professor in a Nautical School, where he taught Maritime Studies. The colonial government discovered that there was fertile terrain in the islands of [[Mona, Puerto Rico|Mona]] and [[Monito Island|Monito]] in 1856.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=56}}</ref> After the discovery, they selected Baldorioty de Castro as the supervisor of a series of experiments to determine the terrain's components.  

In 1857, the cattle industry in Puerto Rico began experiencing difficulties, when the number of animals diminished significantly. To resolve this problem, the island's Economic Society formed a commission composed of Baldorioty de Castro, Jos<U+00E9> Juli<U+00E1>n Acosta and Juan Hern<U+00E1>ndez Arbizu.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=57}}</ref>

Baldorioty de Castro proposed that [[geometry]] classes be included in the curriculum of elementary schools in Puerto Rico, which was accepted by the pertinent authority. On [[January 2]], [[1858]], the Economic Society unanimously named him the Secretary of the Studies Commission. On [[June 4]], [[1860]], the organization named him vocal of a commission in charge of promoting conservation of the island's natural resources.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=58}}</ref> Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, until 1865. On [[September 17]], [[1864]], he was certified as a [[Applied mechanics]] professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five dollars amonth.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=59}}</ref> 

While working in the Spanish Parliament, he made the most of his position and voiced his views about the abolishment of slavery and the establishment of a constitution which would guarantee Puerto Ricans more political rights.<ref name="SA">[http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/baldorioty.html The World of 1898, The Spanish-American War]</ref> On [[November 4]], [[1866]], he was named Puerto Rico's representative in Paris' 1867 Universal Exposition.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=74}}</ref> He served as a critic and subsequently wrote a review titled ''Exposici<U+00F3>n Universal de Par<U+00ED>s en 1967. Memoria presentada a la Comisi<U+00F3>n Provincial de Puerto Rico''. After completing his participation in Paris, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico, at the moment when there was political instability between groups with supported the abolition of slavery in the island and the Spanish colonial government.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=75}}</ref> This led to protests and demands by the local [[Criollo (people)|Creole]] population and influenced several revolutionaries which led to the [[Grito de Lares]]. Baldorioty de Castro did not promote the armed revolution, instead he choose to debate the several conflicts and issues on diplomatic venues. After the revolution attempts, a new superior provisional government was established in the island.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=80}}</ref> This government promoted a union between the conflicting parties in order to establish reforms in the government's structure. In line with the proposed solution, Baldorioty de Castro proposed a conciliation of these groups, but the efforts to unify the opposing views was unsuccessful. After this, he traveled to Madrid, under political pressure, and presented the island's status situation to the respective authorities.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=52}}</ref> He began writing several documents containing strong criticism towards the colonial government and wrote a report listing the elements that he felt were being used by the administration that were affecting the island's social and economic aspects. In January 1867, Baldorioty de Castro received a communication from Puerto Rico's Superior Instruction Juncture, notifying him that he was selected as a member of the Test Commission, where he was in charge of monitoring tests being issued in Physics and Natural Sciences.<ref>{{cite book| title=Baldorioty, Ap<U+00F3>stol| author=Jos<U+00E9> A. Gautier Dapena| publisher=Instituto de Cultura Puertorique<U+00F1>a| location=Spain| year=1970| chapter=| page=73}}</ref> 

In 1870, he was named deputy to the Spanish Courts, after the governor in office had revoked all of the recognitions which accredited him as an educator.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=43}}</ref>  There he continued to speak about his cause. Baldorioty de Castro became known as [[List of people known as the father or mother of something|"The Father of Puerto Rican Autonomy"]]. On [[November 19]], [[1872]], Ramon Baldorioty de Castro together with [[Luis Padial]], [[Julio Vizcarrondo]] and the Spanish Minister of Overseas Affairs, Segismundo Moret, presented a proposal for the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=53}}</ref> On [[March 22]], [[1873]], the Spanish Government approved the proposal which became known as the [[Moret Law]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.topuertorico.org/culture/famousprA-C.shtml| title=Famous Puerto Ricans| publisher=welcome.topuertorico.org| language=Spanish| accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref>

Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico in 1873 and went to live in the City of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]].  There, he became the founder of the newspaper ''El Derecho'' (The Law). He was also the founder of a weekly paper called ''La Cr<U+00F3>nica'' in which he was able to express his ideas on autonomy for the island.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=56}}</ref> In 1887, Baldorioty de Castro co-founded, along with [[Jos<U+00E9> de Diego]], the Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico. He named a young and upcoming politician, [[Antonio R. Barcel<U+00F3>]], the position of party Secretary. The Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico became one of Puerto Rico's first political parties. Its credo was that Puerto Rico should pick its own government and should have a representative in the Spanish Parliament. The Spanish government, however, considered Baldorioty de Castro a dangerous person and a dissenter and had him jailed in [[Fort San Felipe del Morro]] in San Juan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Baldorioty Ahora| author=Luis Vega Ramos|  publisher=PROELA| location=Puerto Rico| year=2002| pages=57}}</ref> Although he was not in jail for long and was soon released, his health suffered greatly during this brief imprisonment. Rom<U+00E1>n Baldorioty de Castro died [[September 30]], [[1889]] in the City of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]. He is buried in Ponce's old cemetery which was renamed "Panteon Nacional Rom<U+00E1>n Baldorioty de Castro".<ref name="SA">[http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/baldorioty.html The World of 1898, The Spanish-American War]</ref>
