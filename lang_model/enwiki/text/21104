Student Nikolas Macko described to [[BBC News]] his experience at the center of the shootings. He had been attending a math class (near the German class) and heard gunshots in the hallway. At least three people in the classroom barricaded the door using a table. At one point, Macko said, the shooter attempted to open the classroom door and then shot twice into the room; one shot hit a podium; the other went out the window. The shooter reloaded and shot into the door, but the bullet did not penetrate into the room. He stated there were "many, many shots" fired.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6560685.stm | title = US university shooting kills 33 | publisher = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}</ref>

There were several scenes of resistance against the offender:
*Professor [[Liviu Librescu]] held the door of his classroom shut while Cho attempted to enter it. Librescu was able to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until his students had escaped through the windows, but was eventually shot and killed.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/849070.html Israeli lecturer died shielding Virginia Tech students from gunman], ''[[Haaretz]]'', April 17, 2007</ref><ref name="Baltimore Sun Librescu">{{cite news | first = Doug | last = Donovan | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/bal-students0416,0,803874.story?coll=bal-nationworld-headlines | title = 'I don't think my teacher got out' | publisher = [[Baltimore Sun]] | accessdate = 2007-04-17}}</ref>
*[[Kevin Granata]] left his third floor office of Norris Hall and went down to the second floor, where the second round of shootings in the massacre took place. It was reported by witnesses that Granata, inside either an office or a classroom with other people, heard a commotion and went into the hallway to see if he could help. He also became one of the killer's victims.

==Victims==
{{main|List of victims of the Virginia Tech massacre}}
Including the deceased shooter, there were sixty-two people shot, thirty-three killed, and twenty-nine directly injured by the shooter.

==Perpetrator==
{{main|Cho Seung-hui}}
[[Image:Cho Seung-hui 3.jpg|thumb|[[Cho Seung-hui]]]]
The shooter was identified as 23-year-old Cho Seung-hui<ref name=nytimes417/> ({{ko-hhrm|<U+C870><U+C2B9><U+D76C>}}), a [[South Korean]] national living in [[Virginia]] as a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|permanent resident]]. An undergraduate student at Virginia Tech, Cho lived in Harper Hall, a dormitory just west of West Ambler Johnston Hall. A spokesman for Virginia Tech has described him as a "[[loner]]," stating that the University was having difficulty finding information about him.<ref>[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8OID5RG0&show_article=1 Va. Tech: Gunman Student From S. Korea]</ref> Several former professors of Cho have stated that his writing was disturbing and he was encouraged to seek counseling.<ref> http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18148802/</ref><ref>http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vtech.shooting/index.html </ref><ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070418/us_nm/usa_crime_shooting_dc </ref> He had also been investigated by the university for stalking and harassing female students.<ref>{{cite news |title=Virginia gunman was accused of stalking: police |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1091699 |publisher=Agence France-Presse |date=2007-04-18 |accessdate=2007-04-19 }} </ref>

Cho's motives for the killings remain unclear. Early reports suggested that the killing was the result of a domestic dispute between Cho and previously alleged girlfriend [[Emily Hilscher]], who was later revealed to have had no prior relationship with Cho.<ref name=LondonFreePress> "[http://lfpress.ca/newsstand/News/International/2007/04/19/4067325-sun.html  Cho, Hilscher had no link]". ''[[London Free Press]]''. [[19 April]] [[2007]]. Accessed [[19 April]] [[2007]].</ref> During the investigation, police found a suicide note in his dorm room, including rants about "rich kids," "[[Wiktionary:debauchery|debauchery]]," and "deceitful [[charlatan]]s" on campus.

On [[April 18]] [[2007]], [[NBC News]] received a package from Cho timestamped between the first two murders and the rest of the massacre two hours later. It contained an 1,800 word [[manifesto]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postchronicle.com/news/original/article_21275707.shtml |title=Virginia Tech Shooter Cho Seung-Hui Mails Manifesto To NBC News  |accessdate=2007-04-18 |work=Post Chronicle }}</ref> pictures, and twenty-three digital videos.<ref>{{cite news | author=NBC | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18169776/ | title= Source: Gunman contacted NBC News during massacre | publisher=NBC |date=18 Apr 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> In the videos Cho discussed his religion and his hatred of the wealthy.

== Responses to the incidents ==
=== University response === 
Virginia Tech canceled classes for the rest of the week and closed Norris Hall for the remainder of the semester.<ref name="Vtfront">[http://vt.edu/tragedy/ Tragedy at Virginia Tech], Virginia Tech University Website, Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> The University also offered counseling assistance for students and faculty and held an assembly on Tuesday, [[April 17]], [[2007]]. Additionally, the [[Red Cross]] dispatched several dozen crisis counselors to [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]] to help Virginia Tech students cope with the tragedy.<ref name="Vtfront"/> 

Virginia Tech President [[Charles W. Steger|Charles Steger]] stated at the first news conference that authorities initially believed the first shooting at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory was a domestic dispute and that the shooter had left campus.<ref name="kurz">Kurz, Jr., Hank. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601226_pf.html "Questions Raised on Va. Tech Security."] ''[[Washington Post]]'', [[Associated Press]] report. [[April 16]], [[2006]], retrieved on [[2006-04-16]].</ref>

=== Criticism of university response ===
Some students, parents, and commentators in the media blamed the university, saying that administrators should have done more to notify others and lock down the campus immediately.<ref>[http://www.abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3046953&page=1 Critical Questions Linger on Virginia Tech Campus] ABC News; April 16, 2007.</ref>

Authorities identified a "person of interest" in the first shooting, Karl Thornhill, who was Emily Hilscher's boyfriend. Hilscher's roommate, Heather Haugh, told authorities that Thornhill owned firearms and had taken both girls to a shooting range. Thornhill was pulled over while leaving Tech's campus after the first shooting, and made authorities suspicious by contradicting Haugh's account.<ref>[http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/60355.html Virginia Tech Massacre: Out of a nightmare], ''The Santa Fe New Mexican'', April 18, 2007.</ref> Because authorities quickly apprehended him, they determined that the threat of further violence was minimal and consequently did not justify additional action by the University.<ref name="wpost">{{cite web|title=Gunman Kills 32 at Virginia Tech In Deadliest Shooting in U.S. History |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041600533.html?nav=hcmodule |accessdate=2007-04-18 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> However, as they were questioning Mr. Thornhill, reports of widespread shooting at Norris Hall came in, suggesting that the threat had not been contained.<ref name=BADLEAD>{{cite news

At an afternoon news conference, Governor [[Timothy Kaine]] of Virginia indicated that [[Charles Steger]] (the president of Virginia Tech) had asked him to appoint a committee to examine the university's response to the shootings and help answer any remaining questions.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/18/news/virginia.php Between Virginia shootings, police chased a false lead]; ''International Herald Tribune''; April 18, 2007.</ref> In an interview with CNN, Governor Kaine indicated that W. Gerald Massengill, former superintendent of [[Virginia State Police]], would conduct the review.<ref name=BADLEAD/>

=== Tribute to self-sacrificing behavior ===
A number of [[Liviu Librescu|Librescu]]'s students have called him a hero because of his actions, with one student, Asael Arad, saying that all the professor's students "lived because of him".<ref>[http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=9016&size=A Asian the killer and some victims in the Virginia Tech massacre], ''[[Asia News]]'', April 17, 2007, accessed April 17, 2007.</ref> Librescu's son, Joe, said he had received e-mails from several students who said he had saved their lives and regarded him as a [[hero]]<ref name=y/> and many newspapers also reported him as the hero of the massacre. {{fact|April 2007}}

== Historical context ==
{{Main article|School shooting|List of school massacres}}
The incident is the deadliest shooting on a college campus, exceeding the sixteen deaths<ref name="includekiller(s)"/> of the University of Texas shooting by [[Charles Whitman]] in 1966. It is the second deadliest school-related killing in U.S. history, behind the 1927 [[Bath School disaster]] which claimed forty-five lives, including thirty-eight school children, through the use of explosives.<ref name="includekiller(s)"/>

With a death toll of thirty-two victims plus the killer,<ref name="includekiller(s)">These totals includes the murderer or murderers. In the University of Texas shooting, different sources claim fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen victim deaths. In the Bath disaster, forty-four were killed by the bombs, with the killer's wife beaten to death earlier.</ref> this is the deadliest single-perpetrator civilian shooting in [[United States]] history, surpassing the [[Luby's massacre]] of 1991, in which twenty-four people were killed.<ref name="includekiller(s)"/> Internationally, it is surpassed by the 1982 massacre of fifty-seven South Koreans by off-duty police officer [[Woo Bum-Kon]] and the 1996 [[Port Arthur massacre]] in the Australian state of Tasmania where thirty-five people were killed by gunman [[Martin Bryant]].

The shooting has been likened to the [[Columbine High School massacre]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://clubs.ccsu.edu/recorder/editorial/editorial_item.asp?NewsID=227 | publisher=Central Connecticut State University | title=Editorial | work=The Recorder | accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> the [[April 20]], [[1999]] [[school massacre]] in which [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold|two senior students]] killed twelve students, one teacher, and wounded twenty-four others before [[suicide|turning the guns on themselves]]. In his video sent to NBC, Cho discussed "martyrs like Eric and Dylan" apparently referring to the Columbine High School gunmen. [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vtech.shooting/index.html]



== Inaccurate media reports ==
{{main|Inaccurate media reports of the Virginia Tech massacre}}
[[Chicago Sun-Times]] columnist [[Michael Sneed]] reported several hours after the incident that "authorities were investigating whether the gunman who killed 32
people in a rampage on the Virginia Tech campus was a Chinese national who
arrived in the United States last year on a student visa. The 25-year-old man being investigated reportedly arrived in San Francisco on a United Airlines flight on Aug. 7, 2006, on a visa issued in Shanghai"<ref>[http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:6BQQ20sSCbAJ:www.suntimes.com/news/343354,vatech041607.article+chicago+sun-times+chinese&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a]</ref>, a claim which was widely used by media, including [[FOX News]], [[MSNBC]], [[ABC News]], [[Sina.com]], [[Sohu]], and so on to hint the gunman might be a Chinese student.<ref>{{cite news|title=Details of killer emerge|date=2007-04-17|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Digital|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/details-of-killer-emerge/2007/04/17/1176696839258.html|accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> The report later turned out to be false and Sneed's article was removed quietly by ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' without any explanation.{{fact}} Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said it was regrettable that "some US media made irresponsible reports on the Virginia Tech shooting before finding out the truth, which violated their professional ethics."<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-04/19/content_853832.htm US reports on 'Chinese killer' slammed] China Daily</ref>

Fox News reporter [[Geraldo Rivera]] incorrectly blamed [[Wayne Chiang]], a Virginia Tech graduate student and weapons collector, as the perpetrator of the crime, after several web surfers discovered the student's [[Livejournal]] profile. Chiang responded by "coming out" and explained he was not the shooter. Following his response came several hoax reports<ref>http://wanusmaximus.livejournal.com/</ref> and a short interview on [[CNN]], and he will make an appearance April 19th on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.

== Gun control debate ==
{{seealso|Gun politics in the United States}}
The massacre reignited the gun control debate in the United States, with proponents of [[gun politics|gun control]] legislation claiming guns are too accessible (and hence Cho readily acquired them) and proponents of gun rights and the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] claiming guns are not accessible enough (and hence none of Cho's victims were armed in the gun-free "safe zone", so none of them were able to defend themselves from his attacks). Note that the much-debated federal [[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990]] is not an issue in this incident; that law applies only to elementary and secondary schools, not to colleges and universities.

=== Background ===
Law enforcement officials have described finding a purchase receipt for at least one of the guns used in the assault.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-ustech-main,0,5858464.story?coll=ny-tintboxrelateds-sports|title=Gunman ID'd as student; tests tie same gun to both attacks|publisher=New York Newsday|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>  There are indications that Cho lied on his [[Federal Form 4473|federal paperwork]] to purchase the guns; the form asks "[h]ave you ever been adjudicated mentally defective (which includes having been adjudicated incompetent to manage your own affairs) or have you ever been committed to a mental institution?"  An affirmative answer disqualifies the purchaser&mdash;and Cho had previously been committed to a mental hospital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://apnews.myway.com/article/20070418/D8OJ2UOG0.html|title=Va. Gunman Had 2 Previous Stalking Cases|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref> The shooter had apparently waited one month after buying his [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 caliber]] pistol before he bought his second gun, a [[Glock 19]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wdbj7.com/Global/story.asp?S=6388845&nav=S6aK|title=Shooter had guns more than 1 month before Va. shootings |publisher=[[WDBJ|WDBJ-TV]] |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref> Cho used 15-round ammunition magazines in the Glock, which were illegal to manufacture between 1994 and 2004, when the Federal Assault Weapons ban was in effect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070418/REPOSITORY/704180366/1013/NEWS03|title= Guns were easy to come by}}</ref>{{POV-statement}} 

Virginia Tech has a policy forbidding unauthorized possession or storage of firearms on campus by students, faculty, and staff, even by state licensed [[Carrying concealed weapon|concealed weapons permit]] holders.  This policy has been challenged in recent years.  In April of 2005, a student licensed by the Commonwealth of Virginia to carry concealed weapons was discovered possessing a concealed firearm in class.  While no criminal charges were filed, it is unknown whether disciplinary action was taken by the school for violating Tech policy due to student confidentiality.

University spokesman Larry Hincker, in response to challenges over the authority of the university to enforce such a policy, said "We think we have the right to adhere to and enforce that policy because, in the end, we think it's a common-sense policy for the protection of students, staff and faculty as well as guests and visitors."<ref>[http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/xp-21770  Virginia Tech's ban on guns may draw legal fire]</ref> 

Virginia bill HB 1572, intended to prohibit public universities from making "rules or regulations limiting or abridging the ability of a student who possesses a valid concealed handgun permit <U+2026> from lawfully carrying a concealed handgun" was introduced into the Virginia House of Representatives by delegate Todd Gilbert.  The university opposed the bill, which died in subcommittee in January of 2006.  Spokesman Larry Hincker responded "I'm sure the university community is appreciative of the General Assembly's actions because this will help parents, students, faculty and visitors feel safe on our campus."<ref>[http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/wb/xp-50658 Gun bill gets shot down by panel]</ref>

At the time of the incident, the sale of firearms to [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] in Virginia is legal as long as the buyer shows proof of residency.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3048534|title=Shooter Identified as Cho Seung-Hui|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> Additionally, though, Virginia has a law that limits purchases of handguns to one every 30 days.<ref>Code of Virginia, [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-308.2C2 <U+00A7>18.2-308.2:2(P) (2005)].</ref> [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Federal law]] requires a [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System|criminal background check]] for handgun purchases from licensed firearms dealers, and Virginia checks other databases in addition to the Federally-mandated NICS.

Prior to the shootings, Bradford B. Wiles, a graduate student at Virginia Tech, published an editorial in [[2006]] in the ''[[The Roanoke Times|Roanoke Times]]'' calling for a change in Virginia Tech's policy prohibiting the carrying of licensed firearms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unarmed and vulnerable|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|url=http://www.roanoke.com/editorials/commentary/wb/80510|accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

=== Media response ===
The response to how gun control affected the massacre was predominantly split<U+2014>while some believe the university's ban on students carrying concealed weapons contributed to the massacre as students were unable to defend themselves against the perpetrator, others believe that the United States', and Virginia's, relatively liberal gun control laws allowed the gunman to purchase the guns and ammunition that allowed the shootings to take place.

The [[Brady Campaign|Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]], an American [[gun control]] group, said that it was easy for an individual to get powerful weapons and called for "common-sense actions to prevent tragedies like this from continuing to occur".<ref>[http://bradycampaign.org/media/release.php?release=884 News Release: Nation Again Grieves Over A Tragedy Of Monumental Proportions], CNN, April 17.</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an editorial calling for more gun control: "Yesterday<U+2019>s mass shooting at Virginia Tech&mdash;the worst in American history&mdash;is another horrifying reminder that some of the gravest dangers Americans face come from killers at home armed with guns that are frighteningly easy to obtain."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/opinion/17tue1.html Eight Years After Columbine], New York Times, April 17.</ref>

On the other side of the issue, the ''Conservative Voice'' contrasted the Virginia Tech massacre with the [[Appalachian School of Law shooting]] in 2002, when a disgruntled student killed two students before he was subdued<ref>"Helping to Stop a Killer: Students Went After Law School Gunman" by Rex Bowman, ''Richmond Times Dispatch'', 5/5/2002.</ref>   by two other students with personal firearms they had retrieved from their vehicles, declaring that "All the school shootings that have ended abruptly in the last ten years were stopped because a law-abiding citizen&mdash;a potential victim&mdash;had a gun."<ref>[http://www.theconservativevoice.com/article/24362.html "Virginia Tech Shooting <U+2014> Gun Bans Are The Problem, Not The Solution"] by Ed Isler, The Conservative Voice, [[April 16]], [[2007]], accessed [[April 17]], [[2007]].</ref>

''[[The Washington Post]]'' described both sides of the gun control debate in an editorial, asking how and when the shooter obtained his weapons, but also asking if the tragedy would have occurred if Virginia law did not prohibit the carrying of lawfully concealed weapons on college campuses.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/16/AR2007041601441.html A Killer in Blacksburg], Washington Post, April 17.</ref>  After reviewing recent U.S. history regarding shootings, ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine concluded, "The [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine killings]] of 1999 failed to provoke any shift in Americans<U+2019> attitudes to guns. There is no reason to believe that this massacre, or the next one, will do so either."<ref name=Economist>[http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9030529&top_story=1 "Guns in America: After the massacre"], ''[[The Economist]]'', [[17 April]] [[2007]]</ref>

[[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Tim Kaine]] condemned this debate in the press and elsewhere as occurring at an inappropriate time. "People who want to take this within 24 hours of the event and use it as a political hobbyhorse <U+2014> I only have loathing for them," Gov. Kaine said during an evening press conference on [[April 17]] [[2007]]. "To those who want to make this into some sort of crusade, I say take this elsewhere."<ref name=washtimes>[http://www.washtimes.com/metro/20070418-121922-4466r_page2.htm "Fairfax man identified as Tech shooter"], ''[[The Washington Times]],'' [[April 18]], [[2007]], accessed [[April 18]], [[2007]].</ref>
