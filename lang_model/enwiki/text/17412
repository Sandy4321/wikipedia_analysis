Preliminary investigations suggest the [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar 966]] front-end loader was taken from a nearby construction site on [[Jaffa Road]]. The perpetrator then drove the vehicle against traffic, before hitting an [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] public bus near the city's old Central Bus Station. The impact flipped the bus onto its side, hitting nearby vehicles and pedestrians.<ref name="haaretz 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/998294.html | title = At least four dead, dozens hurt in Jerusalem terror attack |date = 2008-07-02| publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''}}</ref> The perpetrator, Hussam Taysir Duwait, was also heard yelling "[[Allahu Akbar]]" during the attack.<ref name="Jpost"/> After a traffic policewoman had shot the driver, the vehicle came to a halt but then started again and crushed another car, killing another person.<ref name="haaretz 3"/>

==Motive==
[[Image:Hussam Taysir Duwait.jpg|thumb|150px|Hussam Taysir Duwait]]

Duwait, a 32-year-old father of two from the [[East Jerusalem]] neighbourhood of [[Sur Baher]], was carrying an [[Teudat Zehut|Israeli identity card]], and was hired by a local construction firm for the [[Jerusalem Light Rail]].<ref name="cnn"/> 

Three Palestinian organizations took responsibility for the attack: the [[Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]], the Galilee Freedom Battalion ({{lang-he|<U+05D2><U+05D3><U+05D5><U+05D3><U+05D9> <U+05D7><U+05D5><U+05E4><U+05E9><U+05D9><U+05D9> <U+05D4><U+05D2><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DC>}}), and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]. Despite the Palestinian claims of responsibility, Israeli police chief Dudi Cohen said the attacker appeared to be acting alone and that "it looks as if it was a spontaneous act."<ref name="msnbc"/> Some two hours after the attack, a [[Hamas]] spokesman said that the attack is "a natural response to Israeli aggression." Nevertheless, he stressed that Hamas did not know who was behind the attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/featuredCrisis/idUKL0243020020080702| title = Palestinian kills 3 in Jerusalem bulldozer attack|date = 2008-07-02| publisher=''[[Reuters]]''}}</ref>

Shimon Kokos, the lawyer of the perpetrator's family, said that Hussam "had not belonged to any militant organization and may have acted out of temporary insanity" and that, "had [he] not been killed during his rampage, it is doubtful whether he would have been judged fit to stand trial."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1414837.php|title=Bulldozer killer may have been temporarily insane: lawyer|date=July 3, 2008|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> "My son never spoke of plans to carry out such an attack, if he had I would have tried to prevent it," Duwait's father, Tayseer told The Media Line as police officers were about to question him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1819720,00.html| title = Bulldozer Attack Shakes Jerusalem |date = 2008-07-02| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''}}</ref>

A Jewish ex-girlfriend of Duwait, commented that "he really didn't hate Jews. The fact is that he was with me. It's insanity, but the motivation was not nationalist" and also that his bad temper may have been related to his "[smoking] a lot of drugs."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25534995/|title=Jerusalem attacker had Jewish lover, child|date=2008|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=MSNBC|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> Other people have gone on the record as well alleging regular drug abuse by Duwait, one neighbour saying that he was "a drug addict [...].

==Aftermath==

Israeli Border Guard officers ordered the Duwait family to remove the mourning tent they erected in the neighborhood for their son. A Border Guard patrol passing through the area identified the construction of the tent and ordered the family to remove it. The family then disassembled the tent without any noted resistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/149328|title=Police Order Terrorist<U+2019>s Family to Remove Tent|publisher=[[IsraelNationalNews.com]]|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=106399|title=Terrorist's mourning tent dismantled|date=July 3, 2008|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> Two days after the attack, [[Defense Minister of Israel|defense minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] ordered the demolition of Duwait's and Alaa Abu Dhein's (perpetrator of the Mercaz HaRav massacre) houses, as a stated deterrent against future attacks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/police-conclude-jerusalem-bulldozer-killer-acted-alone-1.249181 |title=Police conclude Jerusalem bulldozer killer acted alone |date=6 June 2008 |work=Haaretz |accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref> Following the supreme court rejection of appeals by Duwait's family, his home was razed on 7 April 2009, the first such demolition since a military commission recommended against such action in 2005.<ref name=houseDemo>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/police-kill-palestinian-assailant-at-demolition-of-terrorist-s-home-1.273712 |title=Police kill Palestinian assailant at demolition of terrorist's home |work=Haaretz |first=Jonathan |last=Lis |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref> During the demolition, police shot dead a Palestinian motorist who ran over and injured three police officers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/middle_east/7987317.stm |title=Palestinian 'attacker' shot dead |work=BBC News |date=7 April 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref>

===Bulldozer attack of July 22===
On July 22, another east Jerusalem Arab resident, Ghassan Abu Tir, rammed his bulldozer (this time it was a smaller [[backhoe loader]]) into cars and a bus on King David street in Jerusalem. He wounded 24 people, including one whose leg was partially severed. He was subsequently killed by a fusilade of gunfire from a [[Israel Border Police|Border Policeman]] and an armed pedestrian. The attack was seen as a copycat act of to the July 2 attack, causing fears of repeated copycat acts in an emerging new terrorist tactic.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/07/22/international/i041751D96.DTL |title=Palestinian in construction truck rams cars |last=Copans |first=Laurie |date=July 22, 2008 |publisher=[[SFGate]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7519404.stm|title=Israelis hit by new digger attack |date=22 July 2008|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref> The attack happened just down the road from the hotel where [[Barack Obama]] was due to stay at for his Democrat world tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL2252341920080723|title=Bulldozer in Jerusalem rampage before Obama visit|last=Harrison|first=Rebecca|date=July 23, 2008|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref>

===5 March 2009 attack===
Two police officers were lightly wounded in Jerusalem when an Arab bulldozer driver overturned their police car and rammed it into a bus, before being fatally shot by police and an armed taxi driver. The attack occurred around 1 P.M. near the [[Malha]] shopping mall, on Menachem Begin Boulevard in southern Jerusalem. Police said that a copy of the [[Koran]] had been found in the bulldozer after the attack, and that the driver had not been carrying any identification. Israel Police and local residents later identified the man as Marei Radaydeh, a West Bank construction worker in his mid-20s who lived with his family in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of [[Beit Hanina]]. Radaydeh was married and had a daughter. [[Hamas]] praised the attack, calling it a "natural response" to Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes in Arab East Jerusalem and to Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1068909.html |title=Two policemen hurt in bulldozer terror attack in Jerusalem |publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''|date= 3 April 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref>
