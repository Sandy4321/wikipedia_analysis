'''KZZA''' (106.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], "La Bonita 106.7") is a [[radio station]] broadcasting an [[Regional Mexican]] format.  Licensed to the suburb of [[Muenster, Texas]], it serves the [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]-[[Fort Worth, Texas|Ft. Worth]] metropolitan area.  It first began broadcasting in [[1990 in radio|1990]] under the [[callsign (radio)|call sign]] '''KKDL'''.  The station is currently owned by [[Liberman Broadcasting]]. Its transmitter is located in northern most Wise County near [[Greenwood, Texas]].

==History==
The station's roots began at 106.5 as a "great oldies" station with the call letters KKGM until [[2001]] when it moved to 106.7 and was sold to [[Entravision]]. However in exchange for the move it was agreed with [[Univision|HBC]] that it would not change to a Spanish format for five years.

So, in August 2002 it launched an English-language format, [[Dance Top 40]], as '''KKDL (106.7KDL, "The Dance Leader"''' and later, '''"The Texas Party Station")'''. In 2004, it moved in a [[rhythmic Top 40]] direction with a Hispanic rhythmic bias as KZZA, "CASA 106.7", in an attempt to target a younger 18-34 audience, mostly third-generation Hispanics. At first, its musical direction focused more along the lines of a typical rhythmic direction, but by 2006, KZZA began leaning more towards '[[Hurban]]' product and less dependent on traditional rhythmic fare, resulting in the station going 'Hurban' full time.

On August 4, 2006, Liberman Broadcasting bought five radio stations including KZZA from [[Entravision Communications]].<ref>[http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2006/07/31/daily42.html Calif. media company to buy Dallas radio stations] - ''Dallas Business Journal''</ref>

However, after a year of 'Urban' programming and trying to challenge rival [[KFZO-FM|KFZO]], KZZA began to shift back to a more conventional rhythmic direction. As a result of this, ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' and [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems|BDS]] moved KZZA back to the rhythmic panel in May 2007.

Of all the contemporary music stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth radio market, KZZA was the only one that features club mix shows every night of the week, unlike their competitors, who relegate it to the weekends. 

On July 7, [[2008 in radio|2008]] the station shifted back to [[Hispanic Rhythmic]], leaving only [[Radio One (company)|Radio One's]] [[KBFB]] as the only rhythmic station in Dallas/Fort Worth. Although ''Casa 106.7'' was broadcasting on a [[rimshot (broadcasting)|rimshot frequency]], it has created a loyal following throughout their 5-year run. On April 6, [[2009 in radio|2009]], the station again switched formats to Spanish Oldies as "La Bonita 106.7", currently running with one jock during the mornings. Ermilo Obiedo airs every morning from 7am-1pm. The rest of the programming is jockless with afternoon requests. This was due to [[KEGL]] changing formats back to [[active rock]] in [[2007 in radio|2007]].
