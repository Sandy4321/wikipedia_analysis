==Character==
===Design===
In April 1990, Sega requested a game capable of selling over one million copies and a character to replace [[Alex Kidd]] as the company's mascot.<ref name="conception">{{cite web|first=Jared|last=Matte|title=1990: The Conception|url=http://www.theghz.com/museum/1990.html|publisher=The GHZ|accessdate=2006-06-03}}</ref> Several character designs were submitted by its [[Sega#Internal structure|AM8]] research & development department, including an armadillo (who was later developed into [[Mighty the Armadillo]]), a dog, an over-sized [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in pajamas (which would later be the basis of [[Doctor Eggman]]'s design) and a rabbit (intended to use its extendable ears to collect objects; these aspects were later incorporated into ''[[Ristar]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonicworld.sclassic.org/angel_island_interviews/interviews/1992/sonic_1992_unknown_1.htm |title=Sega Visions Interview with Yuji Naka |year=1992 |month=October |accessdate=2006-03-06}}</ref> Eventually, [[Naoto Ohshima]]'s spiky hedgehog was chosen as the new mascot. A group of fifteen started working on ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', and renamed themselves [[Sonic Team]]. The game's soundtrack was composed by [[Masato Nakamura]] of the band [[Dreams Come True]]. Sega sponsored the group's "Wonder 3" tour, painting Sonic on the tour bus, distributing pamphlets advertising the game, and having footage of the game broadcast above stage prior to its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_sonicteam.php?article=nakamura|publisher=Sonic Central|title=Masato Nakamura interview|format=flash|accessdate=2006-02-07}}</ref>
<!--In the 1990s, there was a trend for game companies to release [[platform game]]s starring unusual "[[funny animal]]" characters, examples of which include ''[[Zool]]'', ''[[Rocket Knight Adventures]]'' and ''[[Crash Bandicoot]]''.
[There was an article in ''Edge'' a while ago in which the developer of [[James Pond 3]] mentioned that while creating that game he spent too long chasing after what Sonic had just achieved. I'll add that here soon. However, I can't help but think that the appearance section isn't the best place for the above two paragraphs, which is why I've commented that one out.] -->

[[Image:Sonics.PNG|thumb|300px|Sonic's character design has been altered through the years. At left is official Sonic artwork from the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' (artwork by Akira Watanabe) and at right is an official render from the newer ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]''.]]
Sonic's precise age, weight, height and other physical characteristics vary depending on the [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in which he appears and the style in which he is drawn. In the videogames, Sonic's  original design by Naoto Ohshima was quite short and childlike, with short quills, a round body, and no visible irises. Artwork featuring this design and drawn by Akira Watanabe<ref name="sega illustrations">{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Sega Video Game Illustrations |year=1994 |publisher=Nippon Shuppan Hanbai (Deutschland) GmbH|location= |id=ISBN 3910052509}}</ref> was displayed on the package artwork for ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', and most subsequent Sonic videogames featured similar designs. Beginning with ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' in 1998, Sonic was redesigned by [[Yuji Uekawa]] as a taller character with longer legs and a less spherical body. His spikes were made longer and more drooping, and his eyes were coloured green. Further changes to the character's design were made for the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 game)|2006 ''Sonic'' game]]. Spin-off media such as comics and cartoons have featured variations on all these videogame designs, with restrictions set by the standardised [[model sheet]]s.[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sonicthecomic/message/12476]

His [[cobalt (color)|cobalt blue]] pigmentation has never been explained in the games; however, explanations were offered as the character was transferred to other media. One origin story was provided in a promotional comic for the original game featured in ''[[Disney Adventures]]'', ''[[Garfield Magazine]]'', and other children's periodicals, which was later elaborated upon in [[Mike Pattenden]]'s ''Stay Sonic'', a book about the character published in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref name="stay sonic">{{cite book |first=Mike |last=Pattenden |authorlink=Mike Pattenden |title=Stay Sonic |publisher=Fantail |date=1993-03-25 |id=ISBN 0-1409-0390-9}}</ref> This explanation, in which the [[shockwave]]s Sonic experienced when he first ran at supersonic speed turned him blue and streamlined his spikes, later became the basic origin for many subsequent UK publications. For example, in [[Fleetway|Egmont Fleetway]]'s ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'', a slight deviation from this was that Sonic was able to transform from a brown hedgehog into his form seen circa 1991 because he exceeded the speed of sound in one of [[Dr. Kintobor]]'s machines while in contact with a [[Chaos Emerald]].

===Personality===
Sonic has been described as being "like the wind." He is noted for being heroic, adventurous, and free-spirited. He enjoys relaxation, but is never one to rest in the face of injustice. He is extremely benevolent, and would willingly put himself at risk for others, taking on any challenge that confronts him without hesitation. Sonic is not generally modest when it comes to his abilities. In fact, he is often portrayed as being narcissistic and self-absorbed; nevertheless, he is always shown to be caring and selfless when it comes to his actions. 

The British ''Sonic the Comic'' presented him as being bossy and arrogant, and characters regularly referred to his strange sense of [[humor]]. Sonic's attitude frequently made cruel jokes at the expense of his friend [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]], behavior contrary to that seen in most of the continuities. See [[Sonic the Comic|that article]] for more information.

American TV shows and comics often state Sonic's favorite food as [[hot dog|chili dog]]s. While this fact is never particularly emphasized in any of the games, this is also canonical in the game universe, as it is mentioned in the official Japanese ''Sonic Advance 3'' manual, and his [[Sonic Jam]] character profile.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nuclear Envoy |url=http://www.concept-mobius.com/info/realcharacterbios/sonic.htm |title=REAL Character Profile - Sonic the Hedgehog |publisher=Concept: Mobius |accessdate=2006-06-03}}</ref>

Sonic had an interest in [[rock music]] and was a [[vocalist]] in his own band in the cartoon ''[[Sonic Underground]]''. Some official character art and a commercial for ''Sonic Adventure'' suggests that he has a personal hobby as a [[disc jockey|DJ]].<ref name="soaa dj-1">{{cite web |title=Sonic as DJ (1/2)|author=Sonic Team |publisher=Sonic Art Archive |url=http://www.sonicresearch.org/art/art.php?currDir=./Sonic/Sonic_Adventure_1&pageType=image&image=sa_sonicdj02_transparent.png |accessdate=2006-06-13}}</ref><ref name="soaa dj-2">{{cite web |title=Sonic as DJ (2/2)|author=Sonic Team |publisher=Sonic Art Archive |url=http://www.sonicresearch.org/art/art.php?currDir=./Sonic/Sonic_Adventure_1&pageType=image&image=sonic_6_32.png |accessdate=2006-06-13}}</ref>  Furthermore, it is displayed in [[Sonic Rush]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] that Sonic also enjoys [[breakdancing]] as it is one of his primary ways for filling up his Rush meter.  His battle moves in Sonic Battle are also based on breakdancing, as mentioned in the attack descriptions. Lastly, he breakdances in Sonic Advance 3 if he finishes a level in a short-enough time.

===Destiny===  	 
Throughout the games, there are various references to Sonic having a larger destiny. He seems to know far more about using the [[Chaos Emeralds]] than any other character (except perhaps Knuckles, Shadow, or Dr. Eggman). In ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'', a [[mural]] deep in Angel Island's Hidden Palace fortells the battle between [[Super Sonic]] and Eggman for the Master Emerald that would occur in the game's Doomsday Zone. Knuckles initially misread the mural to mean that Eggman would protect the Master Emerald from a villainous powered-up Sonic but eventually realized the truth. There is also speculation that [[Gerald Robotnik]] had seen the mural during his studies of Echidna culture and that the lasting image played a hand in the appearance of [[Shadow the Hedgehog]]. Super Sonic's role in Echidna legend is expanded on in ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' where via [[Tikal the Echidna]] the player learns that Sonic could be taken to be the 'controller' spoken of in a verse Tikal learned from her grandmother. 	 
 	{{Cquote| 	 
	<!--''It's something my grandmother taught me. I'm never to forget it.''--> 	 
	''It goes like this, "The servers are the Seven Chaos. Chaos is power, power enriched by the heart. The controller is the one that unifies the chaos."''<br />	 
	''<!--But -->I'm still not sure what it all means. But the number 7... is the same as the number of Emeralds there are.''}}
Later in the game, it appears that the 'controller' is also the [[Master Emerald]], for the verse changes slightly when Tikal asks it for help in trapping [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Chaos]] inside the Emerald.
	{{Cquote|''The Seven Emeralds are the servers. Chaos is power, enriched by the heart. The controller serves to unify the chaos.'' Uhh... ''The Seven Emeralds can change our thoughts into power. If this Emerald controls that power... Please, you must stop him!''}} 	 
		 
In ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', Knuckles alludes to this role when he recites the verse himself and tells Sonic only his Super form can beat [[Finalhazard]] to save the world.
 	 
Comments made by SEGA staff in regards to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006 game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' reveal that Sonic may perhaps be the legendary entity referred to by some as the 'Iblis Trigger'; an associated trailer shows [[Silver the Hedgehog]] referring to him as such.<ref name="gametrailers e3 tour">{{cite web |publisher=Gametrailers.com |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/gamepage.php?id=2146 |title=Sega E3 2006 Video Tour |accessdate=2006-05-14}}</ref> The word [[Iblis]] relates to the equivalent of the devil, or [[Satan]], in [[Islam]]ic culture. Silver is a time traveller who has been sent back in time to stop Sonic from causing an unknown tragedy.<ref name="silver surfer">{{cite web|url=http://news.sonicstadium.org/story/184/|first=Svend|last=Joscelyne|title=E3: The Silver Surfer|publisher=Sonic Stadium|date=2006-11-05}}</ref>

Finally, some people believe that Sonic may have been designed by Professor Gerald, and that Sonic is a more advanced version of Shadow. However, there is very little canonical proof that this is true.

===Home===
Sonic's home planet is [[Earth]], although the name it is referred by has varied slightly depending on minor regional differences. Sonic lives at a location known as [[South Island (Sonic the Hedgehog)|South Island]] during ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic 1]]'', and (according to early written material from Sonic Team) was originally born on [[Christmas Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sonicworld.sclassic.org/south_island_stories/content/green_hill_zone/sonic_sti.htm |title=Mary Garnet Story (translated from the Japanese original) |accessdate=2006-03-14}}</ref>

'''Earth:''' Although Sonic has always lived on Earth to players living in [[Japan]] during the 1990s 16-bit era, players elsewhere then believed that Sonic's home world was called "Mobius" because of localized information provided by some later American and European instruction manuals. This name stemmed from a mistranslation of the word "Mobius" in a 1992 ''Sega Visions'' interview with Yuji Naka; he was in fact referring to a [[Mobius strip]] used in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic 2]]''.<ref name="mobius origin">{{cite web |author=Nuclear Envoy |title=Where does Sonic come from? |url=http://www.concept-mobius.com/info/plotholespeculation/wheresoniccomesfrom.htm |publisher=Concept: Mobius |accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> However, all games produced since 1999's ''Sonic Adventure'' have taken place on Earth, and all of them use the same story and names regardless of the language they are played in. ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' was the first game of the franchise to consistently use the term "Earth" in-game, a standard which holds true down to the present day. It, its remake ''Sonic Adventure 2: Battle'', and subsequent game ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' even show views of Earth from space.

'''Mobius:''' In all American and European comics, cartoons, books and some [[instruction manual (computer and video games)|manual]]s published before 1999, Sonic's home is a planet called [[Mobius (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Mobius]]. The long-standing US Archie comic expand on the relationship between Mobius and Earth, as Mobius being Earth's future. This occurs after Xorda aliens set off a Gene Bomb, wiping out the human race. How Dr. Robotnik survived is an unexplained question. This is a possible reason why the animals talk, as everything except for the animals died in the explosion, and over time the animals mutated and evolved into the various species. The timeline in the Archie comic series is set about 1300 years in the future.<ref name="archie future">{{comic book reference |writer=Penders, Ken |story=Parallel Paradigm |inker=[[Jim Valentino|Valentino, Jim]] |title=Sonic Super Special |issue=7 |date=[[2004-11-17]] |publisher=Archie Comics |page=42 |panel=3}}</ref> The British spin-off ''Sonic the Comic'' stated that the version of Mobius in that comic is a world completely separate from Earth, and is described as the Earth's sister planet (to the point of actual humans from Earth invading it). In ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'' and ''Sonic Underground'', two other Sonic cartoon series, no relationship between Earth and Mobius had been noted.

'''Planet Freedom:''' This world only appeared in the [[Sonic OVA]] (''Sonic the Movie''). During the course of the film, it is explained that this world is split into two dimensions: The Land of the Sky, which is home to Sonic and his friends, and the Land of Darkness, where Dr. Eggman resides. 

'''Unknown:''' Sonic's home in the ''Sonic X'' anime series is an unknown planet in an alternate reality that shares the same space as Earth, as revealed in [[Sonic X media and release information#Episode 49: The Beginning of the End|Episode 49]]. This logically suggests that the planet is indeed an alternative Earth, although this has not been explicitly confirmed.<ref name="mobius origin"/>

==Abilities==
Sonic is known as "the fastest thing alive", with the ability to run at speeds higher than [[Mach number|Mach 1]].<ref name="age-speed"/> He can run backwards just as well as forwards. The source of this ability is not given in the games, although ''Stay Sonic'' (which gave his fastest recorded speed as 761[[Miles per hour|mph]]) and later British publications explained that it was achieved through training on a [[treadmill]].<ref name="stay sonic"/> <!-- Never heard of this book: It has been officially conirmed in the book titled "Sonic Story" that his 'Power Sneakers' are in fact the main scource of his incomparible speed.--> In both ''Stay Sonic'' and the ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' cartoon, Sonic's distinctive "Power Sneaker" shoes are used to protect his feet from the heat arising from the [[friction]] involved when running at such speeds. He is often aided by his friends, notably in ''Sonic Heroes'' where teamwork is the only way to complete the game. In the original 2D games, once Sonic had reached his top speed, he ran with his arms fixed pointing forwards. However, in the 3D titles and the ''Sonic Advance'' series, his top-speed running animation was altered so that his arms trailed behind him and that he bent over more. This animation is copied by most of the other, super-fast characters.

In the [[Archie Comics]], Sonic stated in a response to a piece of [[fan mail]] that the fastest he ever ran was twice the speed of sound, while in his super state he can travel at the speed of light.  As for how he can run so fast, he was born with the ability. Many of his abilities are variations on the tendency for hedgehogs to roll into tight balls for protection. His primary offensive maneuver is the spin jump (or "Sonic Spin Attack"); as Sonic jumps, he curls up and spins round, damaging any enemies which come into contact with him. This ability was enhanced in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' with the introduction of the "Insta-Shield", which allows Sonic to momentarily surround himself with a spherical [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]], giving him a split-second's worth of protection, and slightly increasing his attack range while jumping.<ref name="Insta-Shield">Information from the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' instruction manual.</ref>  (In ''Sonic the Comic'', he claims he achieves this effect by "vibrating the molecules of air around me at supersonic speeds".)

He can also curl into a ball while running, allowing his momentum to carry him along in an equally dangerous attack.<ref name="Sega-16"/> Although well-protected, in this position he cannot maintain his top speed, and curling up limits the amount of control he (and the player) has over his movements. The "Spin-Dash", introduced in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', allows Sonic to quickly accelerate into this roll from a stationary position. The "Super Peel-Out" introduced in ''[[Sonic CD]]'' (also known as the "Figure Eight" move in the comics, so called due to the shape his feet take when he does this) accelerates him in a similar manner, but allows him to remain running in an upright position.

Sonic can run or bounce across the surface of water, but he can't actually swim.<ref name="age-speed"/> In ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'', a water shield allows Sonic to breathe underwater, but in the 3D Sonic games, landing in water is usually the equivalent of instant death. In the [[Fleetway]] comic book ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'', his inability to swim was one of his major weaknesses for a long time. Sonic's fear of water is often alluded to in the animated series ''[[Sonic X]]'' and [[Sonic Underground]], though in [[Sonic X media and release information#Episode 9: The Last Resort|Episode 9]] of ''[[Sonic X]]'', Sonic is seen to be able to swim when he rescues Amy from drowning.

In [[Sonic X media and release information#Episode 13: Beating Eggman.2C Part 2|Episode 13]] of the most recent series, ''Sonic X'', Sonic displays a superior degree of strength compared to other characters. This might prove that he has some power in his arms like Knuckles (but more than likely, not as much).
Sonic might be equal to Shadow. However, because Sonic X is widely accepted as non-canon, he may not truly have super strength. Also, Sonic is considered superior to Shadow due to his ability to use Chaos Control without a real Chaos Emerald. Nonetheless, it has been noted that Shadow can use Chaos Control (along with many other chaos-related abilities) without an emerald, as the emerald is simply used to amplify his powers' strength.

===Transformations===
[[Image:Supersonicx.jpg|right|thumb|Super Sonic in the television show Sonic X.]]
{{main|Super Sonic}}
Since the 16-bit version of ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', Sonic has had the ability to transform into an incredibly powerful form known as '''[[Super Sonic]]'''. The transformation is triggered by collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds, and at least fifty rings. As Super Sonic, he is even faster than normal, can jump higher, can fly, and is invincible to most attacks and obstacles. Sonic's appearance also changes; his body becomes yellowish-gold, he becomes a bit taller, his quills rise into a wilder arrangement, his eyes turn red, and he physically resembles [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]]. <!-- This bit makes it confusing: (in earlier games, turn a lime green but in more recent games, where Sonic's eyes are already green, his eyes turn red.{{fix|confusing|inline}} --> This is similar to the [[Super Saiyan]] transformation of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' fame.

''[[Sonic 3 and Knuckles]]'' introduced the even more powerful '''[[Super Sonic#Hyper Sonic|Hyper Sonic]]'''. Hyper Sonic glows with the colors of the Chaos Emeralds, is surrounded by glowing sparks, and leaves [[afterimage]]s in his wake. Unlike Super Sonic, he cannot drown underwater and wields the devastating "lightning flash" attack (called "Sonic Boom" by fans), which can be used to "double-jump" in any direction. When it is performed, it destroys all enemies on-screen with a bright flash. Hyper Sonic was only available in ''Sonic 3 and Knuckles''. 

The absence of Hyper Sonic and the Super Emeralds in all other games except ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'' suggests that this ascended form of Super Sonic is not completely [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], but is just closer to what Super Sonic is really like. Newer games show that Chaos Emeralds grow larger while on the Master Emerald altar, which makes their size resemble that of the Super Emeralds. We can see in parts of Sonic Adventure 2 that the Master Emerald itself changes size.  In one part, it is big enough to stand on, while in another, Knuckles can hold it in his hand. This may hint that the size differences on the altars are artistic liberties. Also, Super Sonic leaves afterimages in the ''Sonic Advance series'', something which only Hyper Sonic of ''Sonic 3'' was known for. On the other hand, fourteen emeralds appear on a mural at the end of the ''Lost World'' stage in ''Sonic Adventure'', so while there is substantial evidence to suggest that Chaos Emeralds and the Super Emeralds are one and the same, this distinction is at best [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]], and at worst nothing more than an [[Imagination|imaginary]] [[object of the mind]].  The mural may also be a reference to the point where Chaos separates the Chaos Emeralds from their glowing light, which is built back after a few moments, leaving fourteen glows. Although in the Gamecube version of the game(Sonic Adventure DX:Director's Cut), the mural was slightly changed and now only has 7 emeralds to correct the confusion.

In [[Sonic X media and release information#Episode 67: Teasing Time|Episode 67]] of the television series ''Sonic X'', Sonic turns into what is known as '''Dark Super Sonic'''. He triggers this by drawing on the power of artificial Chaos Emeralds created by the Metarex. His body turns black and he has a black smokey effect. An ascended form of Sonic gone out of control from grief and stress, this transformation allows him to have extreme speed and attacking power. This is similar to Super Sonic in ''Sonic the Comic'', who was brash, psychotic and powerful beyond comprehension. However, this form only appeared for a few minutes, until Dr Eggman arrived and calmed Sonic down by telling him that he did not want to see Sonic listen to his hate and anger.<ref name="dark sonic script">{{cite web |author=Solly. SonKnuk |title=Transcript of Episode 67 |url=http://sonicx2.free.fr/Extras/SRT/SonicX_Ep67_Solly.srt |accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> Super Sonic spends more time toying with his opponent and making comments about their fighting skill, while Dark Super Sonic just destroys his enemies. However, since Dark Super Sonic does not appear in any games, he probably does not officially exist in the Sonic Universe.

==Relationships==
<!-- Brief, one sentence (max of two) summary text of subsections. -->
===Friends===
Sonic's best friend is considered by some to be a young fox called [[Miles "Tails" Prower]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Nuclear Envoy |url=http://www.concept-mobius.com/info/realcharacterbios/tails.htm |title=REAL Character Profile - Miles "Tails" Prower |publisher=Concept: Mobius |accessdate=2006-06-21}}</ref> Tails idolizes Sonic and sees him as a [[Mentoring|mentor]], while Sonic views Tails as a little brother.<ref name="tails_profile">{{cite web |author=Sonic Team |publisher=Sonic Central |url=http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_allabout.php?article=soniccharacters |title=Tails' Profile at Sonic Central |format=flash |accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref> This is particularly prevalent in the ''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog'' TV series, in which Sonic takes in Tails, an orphan unaware of who his parents are. This weakness of Tails is used a few times by Doctor Eggman to lure and capture him so that he can use Tails as bait to capture Sonic. Sonic and Tails are rarely without each other - they often go emerald searching, as seen in ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', or stop Eggman's plans together. In ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'', when the two are picked together, they are described as an "Unbreakable Bond."

[[Image:Son&amy.jpg|thumb|left|Sonic the Hedgehog with Amy Rose.]]In the video games, [[Amy Rose]] is a young girl who acts the part of Sonic's Girlfriend.<ref name="amy_profile">{{cite web |author=Sonic Team |publisher=Sonic Central |url=http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_allabout.php?article=soniccharacters |title=Amy's Profile at Sonic Central |format=flash |accessdate=2006-04-23}}</ref> Sonic does not dislike Amy, and although he is still quite repelled by her constant advances to marry him, the two have been fast friends since ''Sonic CD''.<ref name="amy_profile"/> Whenever Amy is kidnapped he often goes out of his way to save her, as seen in ''[[Sonic CD]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' and ''[[Sonic Riders]]''. <!-- No rumors OR OPINION please, that's [[fancruft]]! --> In ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'', when the two are picked together, they are described as a "Lovely Couple." 

Another friend of Sonic is [[Knuckles the Echidna]]. They first met as enemies in ''[[Sonic 3]]'', and although they are now allies, it's usual to find them fighting. Knuckles and Sonic are both good friends, yet also rivals and equally powerful (or, rather, Sonic's speed is equally balanced with Knuckles's power,) which explains why there never was a final victorious ending in their fights. Although he is envious of Sonic's adventurous lifestyle, Knuckles still dislikes Sonic's carefree nature.<ref name="knuckles_profile">{{cite web |author=Sonic Team |publisher=Sonic Central |url=http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_allabout.php?article=soniccharacters |title=Knuckles' Profile at Sonic Central |format=flash |accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref> On the other hand, Sonic sees Knuckles as being far too serious and perhaps even a bit thickheaded, on occasion referring to him as 'Knucklehead'. In a sense, they are almost like brothers in that they each have disagreements but are still very close friends. In ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'', when the two are picked together, they are described as "Fighting Buddies." 

Sonic is also friends with [[Cream the Rabbit]], a 6 year old girl. Sonic doesn't converse with her very much, as they don't seem to share many interests. He is very impressed by her manners, though, as seen in ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]''. The two of them also make the biggest connection to [[Blaze the Cat]].

A unique character that has only appeared in two games is [[Emerl]], who had, more or less, a father-son relationship with Sonic. They became close friends, with Sonic helping Emerl "grow up". At the end of [[Sonic Battle]], when Emerl was near death, Sonic was in obvious emotional turmoil, though he never expressed sadness, rather distress.  

Blaze the Cat is a princess brought to Sonic's world from another dimension.<ref name="blaze bio">{{cite web |author=Nuclear Envoy |url=http://www.concept-mobius.com/info/realcharacterbios/blaze.html |title=REAL Character Profile - Blaze |publisher=Concept: Mobius |accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref> At first, the other characters suggest she should seek Sonic's help - Blaze denies this and wonders why they are so dependent on him. However, through working with Sonic in order to save the universe from Eggman and Eggman Nega, Blaze learns the value of friendship, and before she goes back to her own dimension, she promises to meet him again. Similar to Sonic's transformation with the Chaos Emeralds, she has the ability to transform into ''Burning Blaze'' using the ''Sol Emeralds'' from her [[parallel universe|world]].

The three comical detectives known as '[[Chaotix|Team Chaotix]]' do not seem to know Sonic very well, despite the fact that [[Vector the Crocodile]], the group's leader, was originally conceived as Sonic's bandmate in the very first ''Sonic'' game.  For more information, see their article.

[[Mighty the Armadillo]] is a character who debuted in [[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]. He has the ability to mount walls (but not stay and climb) for a short period of time.  For more information, see those articles.

===Enemies and rivals===
Sonic's eternal enemy is [[Dr. Eggman]], also known as Doctor Robotnik. Eggman is a brilliant scientist who uses his numerous machines to attempt to conquer the world, but Sonic has always intervened.<ref name="eggman_profile">{{cite web |author=Sonic Team |publisher=Sonic Central |url=http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_allabout.php?article=soniccharacters |title=Dr Eggman's Profile at Sonic Central |format=flash |accessdate=2006-04-23}}</ref> Sonic originally fought Dr. Eggman because he was turning his animal friends into robotic slaves known as Badniks. Sonic freed his friends, then stopped Eggman multiple times from conquering Earth using the Chaos Emeralds, Time Stones and Master Emerald. Often, these would be used to power Robotnik's huge Mech suits, gigantic and incredibly powerful images of himself. However, in the recent games, Dr. Eggman has taken a different approach, using warships and even a nuclear missile to conquer the world.  

Sonic's arch-rival is [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], the "Ultimate Life Form".  They became enemies in ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', and they have fought and argued with each other whenever they meet in every game since. <!-- This smells a bit crufty: Although they fight for different reasons, they battle with a certain amount of respect that was learned over time. -->  They fight for different reasons, yet have similar opinions about each other despite their differences; when they were enemies in ''Sonic Adventure 2'', Sonic found Shadow to be violent, humorless, and arrogant, while Shadow found Sonic to be foolhardy, irritating and arrogant.  However, this situation did not last forever: near the end of ''Sonic Adventure 2'', Shadow willingly fought the Biolizard to allow Sonic to go with Knuckles to stop the Chaos Emeralds; in ''Sonic Heroes'' they joined forces in the battle against Metal Sonic.  Hence, while these two do not enjoy being in each other's company, they will work together when the situation warrants it. However, in [[Shadow The Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow The Hedgehog]], when Shadow first meets up with Sonic, Sonic seems to greet him like a friend, making the rivalry a bit more like Sonic and Knuckles, but more fierce. <!-- avoid making opinionated remarks about Shadow, which is [[fancruft]]. -->

Before Shadow's introduction, [[Metal Sonic]] was one of Sonic's fiercest adversaries. During the older days, Eggman tried to beat Sonic at his own game by creating numerous Sonic robots to destroy his nemesis. Though they all tried and failed, Metal Sonic was by far Eggman's most successful creation, having the same capabilities as his counterpart.<ref name="metalsonic_profile">{{cite web |author=Sonic Team |publisher=Sonic Central |url=http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_allabout.php?article=soniccharacters |title=Metal Sonic's Profile at Sonic Central |format=flash |accessdate=2006-04-23}}</ref> Even with Shadow in the spotlight now, Metal Sonic still remains a serious threat, as the storyline in ''Sonic Heroes'' demonstrated. Some fans debate over whether Metal Sonic is truly replaced by Shadow the Hedgehog in his role. While Shadow is a very popular character, Metal Sonic's popularity is still one an equal if not slightly higher level among fans. Some say Metal Sonic is still Sonic's true rival, as Shadow is acting a bit more like a friend than a rival. Metal Sonic's current location is unknown to everyone, except possibly Omega and Shadow, who were seen with his crumpled frame at the end of ''Sonic Heroes''. Although it is speculated that Metal Sonic was destroyed, this is unlikely; Metal Sonic might come back again in future games, as it is hinted in ''Heroes'' that Sonic and Metal Sonic are still rivals to the end, when the two make a mutual vow to battle again.<ref name="metal sonic bio">{{cite web |author=Nuclear Envoy, et al |url=http://www.concept-mobius.com/info/realcharacterbios/metalsonic.htm |title=REAL Character Profile - Metal Sonic |publisher=Concept: Mobius |accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

Another one of Sonic's rivals is [[Babylon Rogues#Jet the Hawk|Jet the Hawk]] from ''[[Sonic Riders]]''.  Jet mocks him for being inexperienced with [[Extreme Gear]] (an air powered hovercraft that comes in the form of skate boards, motorcycles & roller blades) and doesn't consider Sonic to be the "fastest thing alive", sparking a rivalry between them.<ref name="riders game">{{cite video game |title=[[Sonic Riders]] |developer=Sonic Team\[[United Game Artists|UGA]] |publisher=[[Sega]] |date=2006-02-21}}</ref> Later, after Sonic beats Jet in a race, they become more friendly, but are still competitive as racing rivals.  Jet finally admits that Sonic is the fastest, but warns him to be ready the next time they meet.

[[Black Doom]] is also one of Sonic's enemies along with the [[Black Arms]] aliens who tried to invade Earth in search of the [[Chaos Emeralds]].<ref name="shadow game">{{cite video game |title=[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]] |developer=Sonic Team |publisher=[[Sega]] |date=2005-11-15}}</ref>  While Black Doom is primarily [[Shadow the Hedgehog]]'s main enemy, (or ally, depending on the route the player takes) Black Doom is still considered one of Sonic's enemies due to his actions against innocent people. (It should be noted that Black Doom sees humanity as being far from innocent; however, this is likely little more than justification for Black Doom's plan to use humans as a food source for the Black Arms.) Sonic can battle Black Doom along with Shadow in one of the game's boss battles against him.

In ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, a new character with vast psychic abilities by the name [[Silver the Hedgehog]] will make his first appearance. He has a mysterious past, just like Shadow. He knows he has to save someone, but he doesn't know who. Interviews with Sega staff and promotional material indicates that Silver is from the future and is trying to prevent the 'Iblis Trigger' from causing a great disaster.<ref name="silver surfer"/>

In the [[Anime]] ''[[Sonic X]]'', [[Dark Oak]] is Sonic's main enemy during [[Sonic X media and release information#Series 3|Series 3]].<ref name="dark oak">{{cite web |author=Innes, Ken, et al. |title=Sonic X / Dark Oak (profile) |url=http://www.absoluteanime.com/sonic_x/dark_oak.htm |publisher=Absolute Anime |accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref> Ruthless and cold-hearted, Dark Oak wishes all animal life dead so that plants can rule. He belongs to the same species of alien as [[Cosmo]] and the other Metarex commanders. Dark Oak, although fairly small compared to others of his kind, possesses great power, enough to even fight [[Super Sonic]] toe-to-toe. He is [[Sonic X media and release information#Episode 77: A Fearless Friend|eventually destroyed]] by a blast from the Sonic Driver, the Blue Typhoon's main weapon.

In the UK series ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'', Sonic had a rival for several issues named [[Commander Brutus]], a highly advanced [[Badnik]] Trooper programmed with a copy of Doctor Robotnik's brain patterns.<ref name="stc 60 70">{{cite web |url=http://sonichq.mobiusforum.net/newsite/comics/issues/comics.php/series.Fleetway/index.60 |title=HQ Comics Database (STC 61-70) |publisher=Sonic HQ |accessdate=2005-07-25}}</ref> In armour constructed from the indestructible metal alloy 'Megatel' that granted him near-invulnerability and immense physical strength and endurance, and a built in anti-gravity device that allowed him to fly, Brutus easily matched and defeated Sonic in battle.  Transforming into Super Sonic, Sonic was able to shatter Brutus' right hand and drive him off.  They clashed several more times until Brutus led a rebellion against Dr Robotnik and was defeated and destroyed by the dictator.<ref name="stc synopsis">{{cite web |author=Pennywise |title=Sonic The Comic Issue Synopsis (V.1) |url=http://www.stc-archive.gue-network.com/Sonic%20The%20Comic%20Issue%20Synopsis.doc |publisher=STC Archive |accessdate=2005-07-25}}</ref>

===Love life in other media===
'''Sonic X''': Sonic's relationship with Amy Rose is further developed in ''Sonic X'' than in the games. In this version the two share a more mutual friendship and work together far more often. Sonic even promises Amy a date at one time (however, this is only in the English dub), and numerous times the two are more intimate.

'''Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog''': The cartoon featured a beautiful, robotic (unbeknownst to Sonic) girlfriend named Breezie Hedgehog. Breezie abused Sonic, asking him for impossible things, exhausting his infatuation with her to capture and trap him by order of Robotnik. Breezie realized she was wrong and set Sonic free, this time being sincere with Sonic. As time passed, she would later end up having a relationship with Robotnik Jr.

<!-- [[Image:SonSalKiss.jpg|thumb|right|Sonic and Sally seen in the SatAM series finale.]] Moved to SatAM article -->
'''SatAM''': In the Saturday morning cartoon, Sonic's love interest is [[Princess Sally Acorn]]. The two share a co-leadership role of the Freedom Fighters and parent/sibling/aunt type roles over Tails. Sonic and Sally are the same age and often do missions together against Robotnik. Although the two have obvious crushes for each other, they had opposite personalities that conflict, because of which they had a hard time admitting their affections. Sally finds Sonic to be too carefree and an airhead, while Sonic finds her to be serious and prissy. However, in the final episode, the two kiss.

'''American Sonic Comics''': The main American Sonic comic ([[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie comic)|Archie Comics]]) has by far the most complex love triangles of all Sonic related media. Love interests within the series include Sally Acorn, Amy Rose, [[Mina Mongoose]] and [[Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie)#Fiona Fox|Fiona Fox]]. For more details on this topic, see ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie character)#Romance|Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie character)]]''.

'''British Sonic Comics''': In the UK, Fleetway's Sonic the Comic mirrored the games by introduced Amy Rose, who was so enamoured with Sonic that she openly lied about being his girlfriend, leading to her captured by Robotnik's force for consorting with an outlaw. Rescued, she joined Sonic's Freedom Fighters and repeatedly teased & pestered Sonic with her affections, with writer Nigel Kitching's intent being to make it ambiguous as to whether she really doted over Sonic, was just winding him up for fun, or both. However, this would be played down and finally dropped entirely as time went on - largely as a result of the "[[Girl Power]]" phenomenon sweeping the United Kingdom -, and Amy quickly went from a lovesick hanger-on into a capable, intelligent hero in her own right. (This was intended from the start but disrupted by, due mainly to the Sonic CD adaptation, Amy being captured on ''four'' consecutive occasions over her first three stories)

===Family===
While Sonic has no relatives in the games, he has family members in spinoffs.

In the UK comic series, no relatives of Sonic are mentioned. In issue 51, a brown hedgehog appeared claiming to be his brother, Tonic the Hedgehog. However, this turned out to be the evil shape-shifter Metamorphia sent by Dr Robotnik. In issue 107, Sonic describes one of his ancestors, 'Bravehog' (a parody of [[Braveheart]]) who liberated Mobius from the tyrannical rule of the villainous hyena King Leer.

==Alternate versions==
{{main|Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie character)}}
<!-- This not a human Sonic, it's a kid with a Sonic haircut: [[Image:9616083347.png|thumb|Human Sonic, illustrated by Yuji Uekawa]] -->
The [[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie comic)|Archie Sonic Comic]] features [[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie character)|Sonic]] with alternate dimensional versions of himself. Many of these versions are similar in personality to the classic Sonic, being heroic and carefree. However, other versions are drastically different. Archie's Sonic comic recently bore witness to an evolution of one such form, wherein a being formerly known as Evil Sonic charged himself on [[Master Emerald]] energy to evolve into [[Scourge the Hedgehog]]. Other such splits have happened in the past, such as [[Sonic the Comic]]'s separation of [[Super Sonic]] as his own entity. In the Archie comics, Sonic's real name is revealed to be Olgilvie Maurice Hedgehog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonichq.org/newsite/general/profiles/index.php/top.Sonic/bottom.Sonic/series.|title=Sonic profiles, ''Sonic Encyclopedia''|publisher=Sonic HQ|accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> He tries desperately to protect that information, possibly out of embarrassment. This name is not canon (official), however, and he is simply known as Sonic the Hedgehog in the games. It is unknown why his name was changed in the comics.

In ''Sonic the Comic'', Sonic encounters an alternate reality where he became evil instead of Kintobor. King Sonic and his Badniks ruled this alternate Mobius until Sonic forced him to turn into Super Sonic, who (in his reality) was a mellow [[hippy]].

==Voice Acting==
The earliest voice of Sonic was [[Takeshi Kusao]] in the game ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]'', a June 1993 arcade release starring Sonic the Hedgehog, [[Mighty the Armadillo]], and Ray the Flying Squirrel.<ref name="ghz segasonic">{{cite web|first=Jared|last=Matte|title=''SegaSonic the Hedgehog''|url=http://www.theghz.com/sonic/segasonic/segasonic.html|publisher=The GHZ|accessdate=2006-06-03}}</ref>

In September 1993, [[DiC Entertainment]] cast [[Jaleel White]], more popularly known as portraying the character of [[Steve Urkel]], as Sonic in their simultaneously released shows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''<ref name="satam credits">{{cite web |year=1993-1995 |title=Full credits of "Sonic the Hedgehog" |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106140/fullcredits |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref> and ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.<ref name="aosth credits">{{cite web |year=1993-1996 |title=Full credits of "Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0222518/fullcredits |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref> White would later be cast as Sonic for DiC's 1999 show ''[[Sonic Underground]].''<ref name="underground credits">{{cite web |year=1999 |title=Full credits of "Sonic Underground" |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230804/fullcredits |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref>

In 1996, when the [[Sonic Anime|Sonic the Hedgehog OVA]] was produced in Japan, Sonic was voiced by [[Masami Kikuchi]]. The 1999 English-language [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] featured [[Martin Burke]] in Sonic's role.<ref name="movie credits">{{cite web |year=1999 |title=Full credits of "Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie" |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0237765/fullcredits |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref>

Starting with the 1999 game ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', all of Sonic's video games feature voice acting. Sonic was played by [[Junichi Kanemaru]], who later went on to play Sonic in the Japanese version of ''[[Sonic X]]''. [[Ryan Drummond]] performed the role of Sonic in ''Sonic Adventure'' and continued to play the role for several games.<ref name="voice credits">Information taken from the credits of both ''Sonic Adventure'' games, the ''Sonic Advance'' series, and ''Sonic Heroes''.</ref> However, [[4Kids Entertainment]] decided not to use Drummond's voice in their US/UK dub of ''Sonic X,'' instead choosing their own [[Jason Griffith]].<ref name="sonicx credits">{{cite web |year=2003-2006 |title=Full credits of "Sonic X" |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367413/fullcredits |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2006-06-27}}</ref> Despite this, Drummond continued to provide the voice of Sonic in the series until 2005, when Sega replaced all their ''Sonic'' voice actors with their 4Kids counterparts, in order to keep his voice the same in all media forms.<ref name="drummond">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sonicanime.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=8575|publisher=SonicAnime.net forum|title=Sonic Voice Actors Replaced With Sonic X Cast!|date=2005-10-09}} <!-- includes Ryan Drummond speaking!---> </ref> Effectively, this meant that beginning with ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' and ''[[Sonic Rush]]'', Griffith became the official game voice actor for Sonic and Shadow the Hedgehog, as well as Jet the Hawk in ''Sonic Riders'', a controversial decision among fans of the [[Sonic Adventure]] series and [[Sonic Heroes]] voice cast. <!-- Please avoid weasel words about how "many" fans dislike the change.

==Appearances==
===Games===
{{main|Sonic the Hedgehog series}}
[[Image:Sonic1.png|thumb|right|Title screen of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video game.]]
Sonic started his battle against his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Sega Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]]. After venturing out on his own in the first game, he was given a sidekick in [[Miles "Tails" Prower]] for the sequel ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (16-bit)|Sonic 2]]'', who would run behind Sonic as they continued their fight against Eggman. The sequel was also the first game to feature Sonic's Super Sonic form. ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3|Sonic 3]]'' and ''[[Sonic and Knuckles]]'' would see Sonic and Tails battle Eggman yet again, with the additional threat of Sonic's newfound nemesis, the misguided ''[[Knuckles the Echidna]]''. Sonic would eventually team up with Knuckles to defeat their mutual foe.

Sonic would be solo once again for ''[[Sonic CD]]'', in which Sonic would use his unrivaled speed to travel through time to defeat Eggman and ensure a good future for the world. ''Sonic CD'' also introduced Amy Rose, Sonic's self-proclaimed girlfriend who only played minor roles in several Sonic-themed spinoff games until ''Sonic Adventure''. It also introduced Metal Sonic, who wouldn't have another major role until ''Knuckles Chaotix''. ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'', the first ''Sonic game'' to feature 3D pre-rendered graphics was a diversion for Sonic as he rescued birds called [[Flicky bird|Flickies]] on an island.

''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' featured Sonic returning from vacation to find the city of Station Square under attack by a new powerful foe named [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog)|Chaos]], under the control of Doctor Eggman. The game was the first true 3D ''Sonic'' game and was the debut of Sonic's homing attack (although it could be used in ''Sonic 3D'' after acquiring a power-up, ''Sonic Adventure'' was the first title to feature it as a standard move). In addition, Sonic was also able to collect power-ups that gave him extra abilities. The game also featured Sonic interacting with non-playable characters and objects in 3D "Adventure" sequences, where the game world could be freely explored. ''Sonic Adventure'' was the first video game title that featured a [[voice-over]] for Sonic.

''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]/Battle'' involved Sonic being framed for a robbery he didn't commit and on-the-run from the military. He also faces a new rival, [[Shadow the Hedgehog]]. However, the two  put their differences aside and save the world from destruction.  Super Sonic makes another reapearence, and it's also the first appearance of Super Shadow. 

Sonic's third 3D action game was ''Sonic Heroes'', which featured four different teams made up by three characters in each. This game marked the return of the group of characters known as Team [[Chaotix]], as well as [[Metal Sonic]].

<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Sonic_&_Friends.gif|thumb|200px|Sonic and his friends. Bottom to top: Tails, Sonic, Cream, Amy Rose, Cheese the Chao and Knuckles]] -->
In addition to these games, Sonic has been featured in a variety of 8-bit console and handheld games as well. ''[[Sonic Triple Trouble]]'' saw Sonic and Tails face off against [[Fang the Sniper]] for the first time. ''[[Sonic Advance]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]] and the [[Neo Geo Pocket]] respectively were the first games to feature Sonic on a non-Sega game platform. Two sequels to ''Sonic Advance'' were released and Sonic has continued his appearances on Nintendo handheld game units with ''[[Sonic Rush]]'' for Nintendo DS.

Sonic has also been a featured character in several [[spin-off]] titles. The arcade ''[[SegaSonic the Hedgehog]]'' had Sonic as one of three playable characters. Sonic has also been featured in some pinball games including ''[[Sonic Spinball]]''. He is also a selectable character in ''[[Sonic R]]'', ''[[Sonic Riders]]'' and the ''[[Sonic Drift]]'' racing games. Sonic is a selectable fighter in both ''[[Sonic Battle]]'' and ''[[Sonic Championship]]''. He also appears as a Hero Side mission partner in the game ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog]]''.

Screenshots and some newly released information has revealed that a brand new ''Sonic'' game is in development for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]. Naka has claimed that Sonic Team is going back to their origins, nearly fifteen years ago, to recreate Sonic's personality and attitude, as well as the gameplay style, to make the title feel more like the original games. Another Sonic title is in development for [[Nintendo]]'s upcoming [[Wii]] console: ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'', which is, from sources, reported as an entirely different game than the one being released for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 and will utilize the new functions of the Wii console. Sonic is confirmed to be in his first PSP game [[Sonic Rivals]]. It is going to be a game where you race against other characters to the end of a level. A sequel to ''[[Sonic Riders]]'' for [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] was also mentioned by Takashi Yuda, (creator of the original ''Sonic Riders'' game, as well as the original designer of Knuckles) but no official announcements have been made by Sega as of yet <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/sonic-riders/683758p1.html|title=Sega talks ''Sonic Riders'', Part Two|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2006-01-26|acessdate=2006-26-06}}</ref>.

===Television series=== 
[[Image:002sonic.jpg|thumb|right|Sonic in the [[Sonic X|Sonic X anime]].]] 
[[Image:036sonic.jpg|thumb|left|Sonic in the [[Sonic X|Sonic X anime]].]] 
There have been several animated television series featuring Sonic. ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' was the first and featured Sonic, voiced by [[Jaleel White]], and Robotnik, voiced by [[Long John Baldry]].<ref name="aosth credits" /> It had a very comical take on Sonic's adventures and battles with Robotnik. It is also interesting to note that in every Sonic series, Sonic has three spines. ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', originally broadcast on Saturdays on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], was broadcast concurrently with the syndicated ''Adventures'' series in the United States. Sonic was voiced by [[Jaleel White]], and Robotnik was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].<ref name="satam credits" /> The Archie Comics continuity was based heavily on this series; it was far more dark and brooding than ''Adventures'', and gained a devoted following.

''[[Sonic Underground]]'', a show in the US, UK and France, ignored the continuity of the previous series and introduced two siblings and Sonic's mother. White returned to voice Sonic, while Robotnik was voiced by [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]].<ref name="underground credits" />

Additionally, there was a ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (Anime)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' Anime [[OAV]] in Japan which featured Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Eggman and [[Metal Sonic]]. Sonic was voiced by [[Masami Kikuchi]] in Japan, and [[Martin Burke]] in the United States where the OAV was marketed as ''Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie''.<ref name="movie credits" /> The series was a commercial failure in Japan and was cancelled after a two-episode run, hence its being released in the US as a movie rather than episodes of a series.

The latest animated Sonic television series, ''[[Sonic X]]'', is an [[anime]] that features Sonic being transported from his world to the human world. Like the other television series, it has an original storyline not present in any of the games, although it can be viewed as an elaboration upon the ''Sonic Adventure'' games' storylines. Music from the games is used during select key moments in the series, and several animation sequences strongly resemble cutscenes from the console titles. In fact, they have the modern Sonic games' character desgins as well. Sonic is voiced by [[Jun'ichi Kanemaru]] in the Japanese version, and by [[Jason Griffith]] in the [[English language|English]] version.<ref name="sonicx credits" />

===Cameos/Popularity===
:''For game cameos, see [[List of games featuring Sonic the Hedgehog#Cameo appearances|List of games featuring Sonic the Hedgehog]]''
Sonic has proven to be an extremely popular character. After having been around only 3 years, he had already surpassed Nintendo's [[Mario]] in popularity according to a June 1993 Q-Survey in Gameplayers magazine. In the October 1996 issue of Ultra Gameplayers, Sonic the Hedgehog's world-wide popularity was claimed to have surpassed even that of Disney's [[Mickey Mouse]], just as [[Mario]] had done by the end of 1990. As a result of this popularity, he has been referred to in various parts of culture due to his popularity. One of a class of [[gene]]s involved in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly embryonic]] development, called [[hedgehog]] genes, has been named "[[sonic hedgehog]]" after the character.<ref name="shh">{{cite web |first=Lynn |last=Yarris |date=2005-11-05 |url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sb/Nov-2004/04-sonicthehedgehog.html |title=Sonic the Hedgehog and the Fate of Neural Stem Cells |publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]| accessdate=2006-06-23}}</ref>

Other references are present in [[television program]]s. In the show ''[[Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi]]'', in the episode "Camp Capers", Ami is captured by Bigfoot. Yumi pretends she is in a video game, and she runs through a 16-bit forest area, jumps on a crab (thus killing it) then goes at sound-barrier-breaking speeds and runs over a checkered loop, obviously a reference to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Green Hill Zone. An episode of ''[[Megas XLR]]'' spoofed Sonic with a parade balloon called Auggie the Adorable Aardvark (that also spoofs [[Mickey Mouse]] by wearing the same clothes), that was mutated and could do Sonic attacks such as the Spin Dash. In the show "[[15/Love]]", in Adena and Tannis' dorm room, there is a poster with the cover of the original Sonic the Hedgehog game in it. Sonic also made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Simpsons]]'''s episode "[[Marge Be Not Proud]]", voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. He appears (along with Mario, [[Luigi]], [[Donkey Kong]], and fictional pro golfer Lee Carvallo), trying to convince [[Bart Simpson]] to steal a video game.<ref name="simpsons">{{cite web |first=James |last=Cherry |date=1997 |url=http://snpp.com/episodes/3F07.html |title=Marge Be Not Proud |publisher=[[The Simpsons Archive]] |accessdate=2006-06-24}}</ref>
On ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' [[Space Ghost]] is seen playing [[Sonic 3 & Knuckles]] on the guest monitor. 

Sonic has also made appearances in [[film]]s. In the 1996 movie ''[[Jingle All The Way]]'', in the scene where Jamie arrives at the parade, Sonic can be seen as a character marching in the parade. In the movie ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'', on the side of an ice cream truck, there is [http://www.powersonic.com.br/saiba_mais/curiosidades/media/hitchy.jpg a picture of a Sonic popsicle]. Sonic has also appeared in ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'': the background of the Noah's Arcade commercial is the Starlight Zone from the original game.

He has also been referred to in other video games. In ''[[Spyro: Year of the Dragon]]'', [[Moneybags (Spyro character)|Moneybags]] threatens to turn [[Spyro the Dragon (character)|Spyro]] into a blue hedgehog if he replies that he won't pay him to continue through Crystal Islands. In April 2002, [[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]] made a hoax that Sonic and Tails were the last two secret characters in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. Some players even tried the "[[cheat code|cheats]]" published, before the magazine revealed it was an [[April Fool's]] joke. <ref>{{cite web |author=DetErest |url=http://ssbm.detstar.com/images/sonictails.cfm |title=Sonic & Tails Rumor, ''SSBM'' |publisher=Detstar |accessdate=2006-06-24}}</ref>

Sonic has also made appearances as a character in [[parade]]s. In 1996, Sonic was the first video game character to be seen in a [[Rose Parade]]. Sonic was also in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]<ref name="essential 50"/> and the only other video game character to ever be in the parade was [[Pikachu]].<ref name="pikachu parade">{{cite web |first=Brian |last=Crecente |date=2006-05-22 |url=http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/pokemon/giant-pikachu-runs-flights-through-nyc-175515.php |title=Giant Pikachu Runs Flights Through NYC |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref>

Sonic has been a mascot for various sport teams as well. Between 1993 and 1997, Sega sponsored the [[JEF United Ichihara Chiba]] [[football (soccer)|football]] team. During this period, Sonic appeared on the team's uniform. During the 1993 [[Formula One]] championship, Sega sponsored [[WilliamsF1]], which won the season. Sonic was featured in the cars, helmets, and rival [[Team McLaren|McLaren]] used to paint a squashed hedgehog after winning races over Williams. The [[1993 European Grand Prix]] featured a Sonic balloon and Sonic billboards. The trophy was a statue of the hedgehog.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jared|last=Matte|title=1993: Year of the Mega Drive|url=http://www.theghz.com/museum/1993.html|publisher=The GHZ|accessdate=2006-06-03}}</ref>
