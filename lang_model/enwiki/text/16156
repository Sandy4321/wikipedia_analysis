The '''Wii Shop Channel''' is an online shop for the [[Wii]] video game console that allows users to download [[Virtual Console]] and [[WiiWare]] games, extra game content, and new channels. Downloading may require redeeming [[Nintendo Points]]. The channel launched with Wii on [[November 19]] [[2006]]. Available software is currently organized into three sections: Virtual Console, WiiWare, and Wii Channels.


==Wii Points==
{{mainarticle|Nintendo Points}}
Wii Points are the currency used in transactions on the Wii Shop Channel. Wii Points may be obtained by either redeeming Nintendo Points Cards purchased from retail outlets or directly through the Wii Shop Channel using a [[MasterCard]] or [[Visa (company)|Visa]] credit card.

In 2008 [[Club Nintendo]] in Europe began offering Wii Points in exchange for "stars" received from registering games and consoles on the website.

==Virtual Console==
{{mainarticle|Virtual Console}}
[[Image:VirtualConsoleChannel.jpg|199px|thumb|right|A Virtual Console game as a channel]]
The Virtual Console allows users to download classic games from past video game consoles. There are currently over 250 games available in North America<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/906/906885p1.html |title=Wii-kly Update (September 1, 2008) |date=2008-09-01}}</ref> and, as of [[December 31]] [[2007]], over 10 million games have been downloaded worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6185358.html |title=Q&A: Nintendo's Satoru Iwata |author=Yohei Ogawa, Randolph Ramsay, Tor Thorsen |publisher=[[Gamespot]] |date=2008-02-05 |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>
All games are exact replicas of the originals with no updated features or graphics, with the exception of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Snap]] which was updated to allow in-game pictures to be posted to the Wii Message Board. New games are added weekly on Mondays in North America, Tuesdays in Japan and South Korea, and Fridays in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.

Consoles include both Nintendo systems, such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Nintendo 64]], and non-Nintendo systems, such as the [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Sega Master System]], [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[MSX]], [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] and [[Commodore 64]] (Europe only). Each system has a base starting price for games on that system. All titles currently range from 500 to 1200 Wii Points.

===Import titles===
In Europe and North America, the Virtual Console features several import titles which were not previously made available in those respective territories. These games cost 100-300 more points than the normal price due to their import status and some translation work.

==WiiWare==
{{mainarticle|WiiWare}}
The WiiWare section features new, original games specifically designed for Wii. Games are priced between 500 and 1500 points. To decrease the size of the games, instruction manuals are hosted on each game's Wii Shop Channel page. Some titles feature additional [[downloadable content]], priced from 100 to 800 points, that can be purchased using Wii Points in game or from the game's page.

The first WiiWare games were made available on [[March 25]] [[2008]] in Japan<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6187517.html?action=convert&om_clk=latestnews&tag=latestnews;title;1 |title=WiiWare launching in Japan March 25 |author=Emma Boyes |publisher=[[Gamespot]] |date=2008-03-11}}</ref>, on [[May 12]] [[2008]] in North America,<ref>{{cite web |author= |title=UPDATE 1-Nintendo rolls out Wii fitness game product |date=2008-02-20 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssConsumerGoodsAndRetailNews/idUSN2034720820080220 |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> and on [[May 20]] [[2008]] in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nintendo of Europe |title=Nintendo announces Q2 release schedule |date=2008-04-24 |url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref>

New games are added every week along side new Virtual Console titles.

==Wii Channels==
{{mainarticle|Wii Menu}}
The Wii Channels section features additional non-game channels that can be downloaded and used on Wii.

Currently, there are three free Channels offered worldwide: the [[Everybody Votes Channel]], the [[Check Mii Out Channel]] (Mii Contest Channel in Europe), and the [[Nintendo Channel]]. An update to the Photo Channel (Photo Channel 1.1) is also available. A fourth Channel, the [[Internet Channel]], a web browser based on [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], is available worldwide for 500 points. This channel was free prior to [[July 1]] [[2007]]. There are also two exclusive Japanese channels: the [[Wii_Menu#Television_Friend_Channel|Television Friend Channel]], which provides channel listing and recording reminder features, and the [[Digicam Print Channel]], which allows users to order business cards and photo albums using photos stored on SD cards or the Photo Channel. Both channels are free. Previously, a [[Wii_Menu#Metroid_Prime_3_Preview|preview channel]] for ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'' was available for free in the fall of 2007 for North America and PAL regions before it was removed from the Wii Shop Channel several months after the game's launch.

There are currently plans for two more channels that will be offered for download from the Wii Shop Channel: the [[Wii Speak Channel]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/915/915632p1.html |title=Wii Speak Gets a Dedicated Channel |author=Jack DeVries |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=2008-10-02}}</ref> will let up to four users of [[Wii Speak]] chat with each other and the [[Everyone's Theater Channel]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aussie-nintendo.com/?pageid=article&t=13008 |title=Everyone's Theater Channel heads to Japan in December |publisher=Aussie-Nintendo.com |date=2008-10-04}}</ref><ref>[http://www.fsi.co.jp/company/news/080929.html Fuki Soft Press Release]</ref>, a [[video on demand]] service that will offer movies and television episodes to Wii owners for 100 to 400 points each. The Wii Speak Channel will be available worldwide for free to those who purchase Wii Speak, while the Everyone's Theater Channel will only be available in Japan this December for 500 points.

The Wii Channels section in the Wii Shop Channel was originally under the name of WiiWare in North America and Wii Software in Europe, before moving to its own dedicated space when [[WiiWare]] launched.

==Downloading==
During downloads, an 8-bit [[Mario]] runs across the screen collecting coins, representing the download's progress. Every 33%, Mario will hit one of the three blocks on the screen. The third and final block is a multi-coin block that Mario will stand under and continue to hit from 99% until the download is complete. Pressing the A button will make Mario shoot fire balls if he is Fire Mario. Sometimes, [[Luigi]] appears in place of Mario, or both Mario and Luigi will swim across the screen. There are six different animations, some appearing more often than others.

Software downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel is saved onto the Wii console's internal memory. After a download is complete, the new software appears on the [[Wii Menu]] as a channel. Software can be copied to SD cards or re-downloaded for free. At Nintendo's fall 2008 Media Summit, it was announced that starting in spring 2009 users will be able to download software directly to SD cards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendowiifanboy.com/2008/10/02/nintendos-storage-solution-load-items-direct-from-the-sd-slot/ |title=Nintendo's storage solution: Load items direct from the SD slot |author=David Hinkle |publisher=Nintendo Wii Fanboy |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref>

==Gift feature==
[[Image:WiiShopChannel-GiftFeature.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Selecting the gift option for Pok<U+00E9>mon Snap]]
On [[December 10]] [[2007]] a gift feature was added to the Wii Shop Channel. This feature allows users to purchase and send games and channels to friends as gifts. Users select a title, select the gift option, and write a message to send with the gift. The recipient then receives a message that a gift has been sent to him or her. This user can then accept and download the game from the Wii Shop Channel. The user is then required to send a thank you note in return. The sender will receive the thank you note and notification that the gift was received.<ref name="gift">http://www.nintendo.com/wii/channels/gifting</ref>

If a user already has the game or if the user does not accept or download the gift within 45 days, then the Wii Points are returned to the sender.<ref name="gift" />

==Game updates==
Downloaded games can receive updates from the Wii Shop Channel. This has been done four times so far to update ''[[Nectaris|Military Madness]]'', ''[[Star Fox 64|Star Fox 64/Lylat Wars]]'', ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'' (in North America and Europe),<ref name=" Virtual Consolation Prize: Military Madness Fixed">{{cite news|date=2007-02-11|url= http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/02/virtual_consola_1.html |title=Virtual Consolation Prize: Military Madness Fixed|publisher= wired.com|accessdate=2007-02-12}}</ref> and ''[[Mario Kart 64]]'' (in Europe and Australia). Several NES and SNES games released before [[March 30]], [[2007]] have also been given updates in Europe and Australia to fix previous problems with the Wii component cables. These updates are free of charge to those who have downloaded a previous version of the game.

==Wii Shop Channel updates==
The Wii Shop Channel has received several updates since launch that have added new features and functionality.

On [[February 16]] [[2007]] PAL regions received an exclusive update that added secret pages called Warp Zones. These pages feature highly detailed background information and tips and tricks for newly added Nintendo published games. These secret pages are accessible only on certain pages through links disguised as ASCII faces.

On [[March 30]] [[2007]], PAL regions received separate news articles for every new game added in an update to the Wii Shop's front page. Previously, all new games in an update would be announced in a single piece of news (with the exceptions of some flagship titles, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time), with very little background information. This was added to the North American Wii Shop Channel on [[May 14]] [[2007]].

On [[August 6]] [[2007]] the Wii Shop Channel's interface was heavily updated. Four "Recommended Titles" are now featured on the Wii Shop Channel's splash page where they can be easily accessed, with new titles and prices indicated. Games are now categorized by system, genre, and publisher with the number of games in each category shown. A search tool was also added to allow users to search for a specific game.

A [[December 10]] [[2007]] update added the ability to send software as gifts to Wii Friends. Along with this update, European Wii owners were given the ability to exchange points collected on the Nintendo of Europe website ("Stars") for Wii Points. The update also included a redesigned start screen and Wii Menu icon that now promotes recently released games.

On [[March 20]] [[2008]] the Wii Shop Channel was updated in preparation for the launch of WiiWare games coming out later that spring.

On [[October 22]] [[2008]] the Wii Shop Channel received an update where the controller information was moved to a separate window within the game program. The Wii Shop Channel also prompts the user before he or she purchases a game to confirm if the user has the required controllers. The Wii Shop Channel also supposedly loads faster after this update.
