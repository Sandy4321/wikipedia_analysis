The '''Zeppelin P Class''' was the first Zeppelin [[airship]] type to be produced in quantity after the outbreak of the [[First World War]].  22 of the type were built as well as 12 of a lengthened version, the '''Q&nbsp;Class '''.  They were used for many of the airship bombing raids on the [[United Kingdom]] in 1915-16, for naval patrol work over the [[North Sea]] and [[Baltic]] and were also deployed on the eastern and south-eastern fronts.

==Design==
The P class was an enlarged version of the preceding [[Zeppelin M Class|M class]].  On 5 August 1914 the Zeppelin company put forward a proposal to the German Navy Ministry for a design based on [[List of Zeppelins#LZ 26|LZ&nbsp;26]].  This had been started as a passenger carrying craft for [[DELAG]] and was the first Zeppelin with a [[duralumin]] framework, and also had the strengthening keel inside the hull structure.  The proposed design was larger, with the volume increased from {{convert|880000|ft3|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1126000|ft3|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}} and a fourth engine was added.<ref>Robinson 1971, p. 35</ref>  As well as being larger, allowing a greater range and bomb load, the P class introduced enclosed crew accommodation: the gondolas of the first M class Zeppelins were open.  
 
The P class had a more streamlined hull shape than previous Zeppelins, with only 60&nbsp;m (197&nbsp;ft) of the 163.5&nbsp;m  (536&nbsp; 5&nbsp;in) overall length being parallel sided.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.95</ref>  Power was initially provided by four {{convert|240|hp|kW\disp=flip|abbr=on}} [[Maybach CX]] six cylinder engines. Later examples were fitted with four {{convert|240|hp|kW|disp=flip|abbr=on}} [[Maybach HSLu]] engines.  The  framework was divided into sixteen 10&nbsp;m (32&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in) bays, with an intermediate frame between each of the principal wire-braced ring frames to reduce lateral loads on the triangular section longitudinal girders, of which there were 17, the uppermost of which was doubled to form a W-section girder.  The 16 gasbags were usually made from three layers of [[goldbeater's skin]] on a cotton backing, but shortages meant that sometimes heavier rubberised cotton was used instead.  Automatic pressure relief valves were placed at the bottom of the gasbags: there was no trunking to carry vented hydrogen to the top of the craft and waste gas simply diffused upwards in the space between gasbags and the covering, whose top surface was left [[dope (aircraft)|undoped]] to allow the hydrogen to escape.  Some gasbags were also fitted with a manually operated manouevering valve at the top.<ref name= Giants_96>Robinson 1973, pp.96-100</ref>  The ship was controlled from the forward gondola, which was divided into two structurally separate sections in order to avoid transmission of engine vibration to the crew accommodation: the small gap between the two sections was faired over with fabric.  The forward section was divided into three compartments, with the control area at the front; aft of this was the radio compartment, and then the officer's rest area, the windows of which had a machine-gun mounting either side.<ref name= Giants_96/>  The engine compartment contained a single engine driving a propeller at the rear through a reduction gear.  The aft engine gondola carried three engines arranged in line, the aft engine driving a propeller at the back of the gondola and the other two driving a pair of propellers mounted either side of the hull.  These were reversible to aid manouvering during mooring.  As in the forward gondola, a machine-gun mounting was fitted either side.  Further defensive armament consisted of a single machine gun in a small cockpit at the stern behind the rudders and a gun position mounting two or three machine guns on top of the hull, which was reached by a ladder from the forward gondola.  The bomb load was slung from the keel girders, the bombs being electrically released from the control car.<ref name= Giants_96/>

In late 1915, faced by increasingly effective defensive measures, Zeppelin introduced the '''Q&nbsp;class'''.  The hull was lengthened by {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, increasing volume to {{convert|1264100|ft3|m3|disp=flip}} and the operating ceiling by about {{convert|1500|ft|m|disp=flip}}.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.101.</ref>  Many of the existing P class airships were similarly lengthened.

==Service history==
P and Q class Zeppelins were operated  by both the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] and the [[Imperial German Navy|Navy]].  Although the bombing raids are their best known activity, the majority of the flights made by the naval craft were patrols over the North Sea and the Baltic.  The class was obsolete by 1917 and most of the craft that had not been lost to accidents or enemy action had  been dismantled by the end of September 1917.  The last survivors were LZ&nbsp;50 (L&nbsp;16), which had been relegated to training duties and was wrecked at the Nordholz base on 19 October 1917.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 334</ref> and LZ&nbsp;46 (L&nbsp;14), which carried out 42 reconnaissance missions and 17 attacks on Britain. It survived the war and was destroyed by its crew on 23 June 1919.<ref name=ZC385>Robinson 1971, p.385</ref>

The first P class Zeppelin constructed was LZ&nbsp;38, assigned to the Army and first flown on 3 May 1915. After a series of raids on the East coast of England, it became the first airship to bomb London on 31 May 1915, dropping {{convert|3000|lb|kg|disp=flip}} of bombs on the eastern suburb of London, killing seven people.  A consequence of this raid was that reporting restrictions were introduced in England.  Formerly press coverage contained detailed acounts of the location of bombing raids: after this, only generalised locations were published.<ref>Robinson 1973, p.103.</ref>  It carried out five raids on England,<ref>Robinson 1973, pp.102-3.</ref> before it was destroyed when its shed at [[Evere]] was bombed on 7 June 1915.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 333</ref>

LZ&nbsp;40 (L&nbsp;10) was the first P&nbsp;class flown by the Navy, and bombed London on 4 June 1915. It took part in five raids and made eight reconnaissance flights: on 3 September 1915 it was struck by lightning and crashed in flames in the North Sea near Neuwerk, Germany, with the loss of the entire 20-man crew.<ref>Robinson 1971, p.384</ref>

On 8 September 1915 LZ&nbsp;45 (L&nbsp;13), commanded by [[Heinrich Mathy]], was the first Zeppelin to bomb central London, setting fire to textile warehouses to the north of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and causing over half a million pounds worth of damage, around one sixth of all material damage caused by the bombing of Britain during the war.<ref>Robinson 1971 p. 109</ref>
 
LZ&nbsp;47 (LZ&nbsp;77) and LZ&nbsp;49 (LZ&nbsp;79) were deployed to [[Namur]] in order to carry out bombing raid on [[Paris]].  LZ&nbsp;49 (LZ&nbsp;79) bombed Paris on the 29/30 of January, but was damaged by ground fire and was destroyed in a forced landing at [[Ath]] in Belgium.  The Army Zeppelins were then used to support the German army in the early phases of the [[battle of Verdun]]. On 21 February, the first day of the German offensive, four of the six available Zeppelins set out to bomb the French supply lines. LZ&nbsp;65 (LZ&nbsp;95), the first Q&nbsp;class Zeppelin, was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire and was destroyed in a crash landing at the base in Namur. The P&nbsp;class LZ&nbsp;47 (LZ&nbsp;77) was hit by anti-aircraft fire over [[Revigny]], catching fire and killing the crew of 11, and LZ&nbsp;58 (LZ&nbsp;88) was forced to return to its base by squalls and snow showers.<ref>Robinson 1973, p. 114</ref>

The Army airships  LZ&nbsp;85 and LZ&nbsp;86 were deployed to the Eastern front.  LZ&nbsp;85  made two sucessful attacks on [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] but during a third raid was damaged by fire from [[HMS Agamemnon (1906)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] on 5 May 1916 and came down in the Vardar marshes.<ref name= Giants113>Robinson 1973, p. 113</ref> The crew of 12 were captured.  The framework was salvaged and, partially reconstructed, put on display near the [[White Tower of Thessaloniki|White Tower]] in Salonika.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Wrecked Zeppelin on View at Salonika |day_of_week=Friday |date= 19 May 1916|page_number=8 |issue=41171 |column=D| section= News in Brief }}.</ref>
  
LZ&nbsp;51 (LZ&nbsp;81) was deployed on the Balkan front, and was used to transport diplomats across hostile [[Serbia]] to [[Sofia]] on 9 November 1915.  Subsequently it made two attacks on [[Bucharest]]: it was eventually brought down by ground fire near [[Turnovo]] in (Bulgaria) on 27 September 1916.<ref name= Giants113/>
