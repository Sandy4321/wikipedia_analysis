==Marines Corps service and inquiries==

In 2003, Sanchez joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] and was trained as a [[refrigeration]] [[mechanic]] with the rank of corporal.<ref name="Hoellwarth-0316"/>
On March 16, 2007, John Hoellwarth, a staff writer for Military Times Media Group, reported that Sanchez was the subject of a Marine Corps inquiry about his appearances in gay pornographic videos and related allegations.<ref name="Hoellwarth-0316"/>
Of concern was whether "Sanchez had enlisted prior to the end of his film career," "if Reserve Marines were prohibited from doing porn when not in a drilling status," and "how the current '[[don't ask, don't tell]]' policy might apply."<ref name="navytimes"/>

In an article published April 1, 2007 by the ''[[Marine Corps Times]]'', Hoellwarth wrote that the Marine Corps was also investigating reports that Sanchez had "wrongfully solicited funds to support [his] purported deployment to Iraq." According to the article, a Marine investigator accused Sanchez of "coordinating a $300 payment from the New York City United War Veterans Council and $12,000 from [[U-Haul]]."<ref name="mt-0401">{{Cite news

Sanchez told the newspaper that the charges were "demonstrably false,"  and that he never collected any funds from the listed organizations.<ref name="mt-0401"/>

==Political activism at Columbia University==
In 2005, while a junior at the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]],<ref name="firm"/>
Sanchez said he was harassed by students during the Fall 2005 "Activities Day" while manning the table for the Columbia Military Society. According to Sanchez, he was approached by members of the [[International Socialist Organization]], an [[opposition to the Iraq War|anti-war]] campus group who told him he was stupid for serving in the military.  According to Mark Xue, president of the military society who was at the table with Sanchez, "They were telling him that he was stupid and ignorant, that he was being brainwashed and used for being a minority in the military."<ref name="firm">{{cite web

Sanchez made a series of [[formal complaint]]s to the university, which upon investigation found no grounds for punishing the three accused students.<ref name="firm"/>
The accused dispute Sanchez's account of the events. In a ''[[Columbia Daily Spectator]]'' editorial, "The Conservative Witch Hunt," Zach Zill wrote that while he did make clear that he found on-campus [[military recruitment]] offensive, he had done so without the use of epithets and derogatory language.<ref name="witch">{{cite web

Monique Dols, another of the accused Socialists, stated the complaint was false and "a discrediting campaign against us."<ref name="firm"/>

Sanchez and others in the student group MilVets, an organization for on-campus veterans, had also voiced their frustration at what they perceived to be a lack of regard for veterans on the campus. In February 2006, the university amended its non-discrimination policy to include "military status" for protection from harassment. According to the University, this was not a policy change, but merely a "semantic clarification," as the words "military status" replaced "disabled or Vietnam era veteran."<ref name="amended">{{cite web
