'''Robert William Andrew "Bob" Feller''' (November 3, 1918{{spaced ndash}}December 15, 2010), nicknamed '''"The Heater from Van Meter,"''' '''"Bullet Bob,"''' and '''"Rapid Robert,"''' was an [[United States|American]] [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]] from 1936&ndash;1956. 

Feller was a prodigy who bypassed the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]] and entered the major leagues at the age of 17. During the 1937 season, the teenage Feller appeared on the cover of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]. Feller played 18 seasons, all with the Indians, his career interrupted by four years of military service during [[World War II]]. A [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] in the [[U.S. Navy]], Feller served aboard the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS ''Alabama'']]. He became the first pitcher to win at least 20 games in a season before the age of 21. During his career he threw three [[no-hitter]]s, the first coming in 1940, the second in 1946, and the final one in 1951. Feller also recorded 12 [[one-hitter (baseball)|one-hitter]]s (his no-hitters and one-hitters were records at the time of his retirement). He helped the Indians to a [[World Series]] title in [[1948 World Series|1948]] and in {{mlby|1954}} an [[American League]]-record 111 wins and the [[pennant (sports)|pennant]]. He led the American League in [[win (baseball)|wins]] six times and [[strikeout]]s in seven seasons. In 1946, Feller recorded 348 strikeouts on the season, a total not bettered for 27 years until 1973. Feller, an eight-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], was in 1999 ranked 36th on ''[[Sporting News]]'' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and also the publication's "greatest pitcher of his time" as well as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].<ref>{{Cite news|year=April 1999|title=Baseball's 100 Greatest Players|work=The Sporting News|page=20}}</ref>

He was elected the inaugural President of the [[Major League Baseball Players' Association]] and participated in [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] exhibition games which featured players from both the Major and [[Negro Leagues]]. Feller, who died at the age of 92, was was described by [[Tom Hamilton (broadcaster)|Tom Hamilton]]: "You don't got to Yankee Stadium and see Yogi Berra at the games, or when they were alive, Joe DiMaggio or Mickey Mantle.

==Early life==
Feller was born and raised in [[Van Meter, Iowa]].

When Feller was 12 years old he began to play [[American Legion Baseball]] in the nearby town of [[Adel, Iowa|Adel]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iowahistoryjournal.com/publisher10.html|journal=Iowa History Journal|accessdate=31 October 2012|volume=2|issue=4|last=Chapman|first=Mike|title=Bill's and Bob's Field of Dreams|publisher=IHJ, Inc.|location=Newton, IA}}</ref> At 13 years old, his father felled an estimated 20 oak trees on the family farm to build a baseball diamond.

Feller attended Van Meter High School and was a starting pitcher for the school's baseball team while he continued to play on the Farmers Union team in the [[American Amateur Baseball Congress]], going 25&ndash;4 for Farmers Union one season.<ref name="feller5" />{{rp|p.4}}<ref name="Gilbert" />{{rp|p.37}} He also was the starting [[center (basketball)|center]] for the high school basketball team.<ref name="Sickels" />{{rp|p.29}} By 16 years of age, Feller was judged to possess a major league quality fastball, and scouts traveled to [[Dayton, Ohio]] to watch him in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, multiple big league clubs offered signing bonuses, but at that point he had already been signed to a professional contract with the [[Cleveland Indians]].<ref name="Sickels" />{{rp|p.25-26}}</ref>

==Professional career==

===Teenage phenom (1936-1941)===
Feller was signed by [[scout (sport)|scout]] [[Cy Slapnicka]] for one dollar and an autographed baseball.<ref name="Sickels" />{{rp|p.27}} While scouting Feller, Slapnicka said, "All I knew was that this was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it wiggle and shot around.

He was planning to add him {and [[outfielder]] [[Tommy Henrich]], whom Slapnicka had also signed to an offer) to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club, in a move that would be in violation of Major League Baseball's (MLB) rules as only minor league teams could sign amateurs to contracts. After a three-month investigation into the details of whether the Indians organization broke any of Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] in December 1936 made it clear that he did not agree with the argument presented by Slapnicka or Indians president [[Alva Bradley]], but awarded both Feller and Henrich [[free agent (sports)|free agency]] and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine.<ref name="Encyclopedia" />{{rp|p.375}} Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court.<ref name="Deford" /> Feller elected to remain with the Indians while Henrich joined the [[New York Yankees]]. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EycbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CkwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6479,5227575&dq=bob+feller+mountain+landis&hl=en|date=11 December 1936|title=Rob the Cradle?

Feller joined the Indians [[List of baseball players who went directly to the major leagues|without having played in the minors]]. He made his Major League debut on July 19, 1936 in a relief appearance against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]]. A month later on August 23, Feller made his first career start. Indians [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Steve O'Neill]] had [[Denny Galehouse]] warmed up in the bullpen in case the 17-year old Feller had early troubles in his first start. Feller struck out all three batters faced in the first inning, then went on to record 15 [[strikeouts]] against the [[Baltimore Orioles|St. Louis Browns]]' lineup and earned his first career win.

On October 2, [[1938 Cleveland Indians season|1938]], with the Indians set for a doubleheader with the [[Detroit Tigers]], Feller was the starting pitcher for the first game. That day, Detroit's [[Hank Greenberg]] was two home runs shy of tying [[Babe Ruth]]'s then- single-season home run record of 60. Feller entered the ninth inning, one strikeout shy of tying the MLB record of 17 in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struckout Detroit's [[Pete Fox]] and then broke the record when he struckout [[Chet Laabs]] for the fifth time that day. Feller set a modern [[List of pitchers who have struck out 18 or more batters in a nine-inning MLB game|major league record]] of 18 strikeouts.

The United States entered [[World War II]] with the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.

Shortly before Feller left for combat, his father died.

Feller later estimated that serving in the military had prevented him from winning at least 100 more games. Based on his exceptional 1941 and 1946 seasons, it is likely that he would have finished his career with more than 300 wins and perhaps 3,800 strikeouts.

===Return to Cleveland (1945&ndash;1948)===
Upon arriving in Cleveland, Feller was honored with a civic luncheon on August 24, 1945, with more than 1,000 people in attendance at the Carter Hotel. Feller gave a short speech before the crowd, saying, "The real heroes didn't come home."<ref name="Dolgan" /><ref name="Tribute" /> Later that same day, the city held a parade and Feller was the starting pitcher in the Indians' match-up with the Detroit Tigers.

"I was so tired from all the receptions I didn't know if I could finish the game," Feller said.<ref name="Dolgan" /> For the 1945 season, he appeared in nine games and notched a 5&ndash;3 record with 59 strikeouts and 2.50&nbsp;ERA.<ref name="Baseball-Reference">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fellebo01.shtml|title=Bob Feller Statistics and History|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>

Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the [[New York Yankees]].

By the late 1940s, Feller, who had obtained his pilot's license in 1939 at the age of 20, began to fly his [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] during home stands from his home in [[Gates Mills, Ohio|Gates Mills]] to [[Burke Lakefront Airport]] and then utilize a collapsible scooter to get to [[Municipal Stadium (Cleveland)|Municipal Stadium]].<ref name="Dolgan" />

===World Series champion (1948)===
The [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|1948 Indians]] had one of their finest seasons but for Feller, the results were mixed.

The Indians won a one-game playoff against the [[Boston Red Sox]] to determine the team to represent the AL in the [[World Series]]; it was the first time the team won the pennant since the 1920 season. 

Feller started Game One of the [[1948 World Series]] against the NL-champion [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]].

Before the 1950 season, Feller suggested to Indians management he take a pay cut. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg said, "He himself made the suggestion.

He spent his entire career of 18 seasons with the Indians, being one of "The Big Four" Indians pitching rotation in the 1950s, along with [[Bob Lemon]], [[Early Wynn]] and [[Mike Garcia (AL pitcher)|Mike Garcia]].

"They overhyped Jackie Robinson. He was a good baserunner. He was a fair hitter. He was an average second baseman. He was not as good a ballplayer as [[Larry Doby]].

==Dispute with Commissioner Chandler==
Throughout his career, Feller criss-crossed the country playing exhibition games in the off-season, playing in front of fans in towns not accustomed to seeing major league ballplayers perform live.

In 1947, Feller announced that he would pitch in the [[Cuban League|Cuban winter league]] during the off-season, but Commissioner Chandler ruled no major leaguer could play in Cuba during the winter.<ref name="Cuban">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uH4hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RYsFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3038,1860065&dq=bob+feller+barnstorming&hl=en|title=Veeck Says Feller Is Bothered Because Fans Are Down On Him|date=19 August 1947|accessdate=3 September 2012|agency=Associated Press|page=6|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]}}</ref> Feller said he would donate his profits from playing in the Cuban winter league to the American Major League players' pension fund.

She had developed anemia after she was given the wrong blood type after giving birth in 1947 to their second child, to which she subsequently battled addiction problems with the prescription medications she was proscribed to take for her condition.<ref name="Deford" /> It was estimated he missed out on over $200,000 in salary when he served in the Navy, where he missed more than three major league seasons.<ref name="Lewiston" /> Said Feller biographer John Sickels in an interview, 
:"They were trying to make money, but part of it was also, he felt that the black players weren't necessarily getting a fair chance and that he wanted to sort of showcase it. And seeing those, I think, those exhibition games helped people realize that the Negro League players were just as good as the Major League players."<ref name="NPR" />

==Later life==
[[File:Bob Feller mound.jpg|thumb|Feller in March 2009]]
Feller and his wife, Virginia Winther, had three sons, Steve (b. 1945), Martin (b. 1947), and Bruce (b. 1950). After giving birth to Martin, Virginia was given the wrong blood type. She survived but was forced to live with anemia from then on and several prescription drugs, some of which she battled addiction with for the rest of her years with Feller.<ref name="Deford" /> The couple were divorced in 1971. From the divorce settlement, Virginia received the house she and Feller had built. Virginia died on May 6, 1981, in her home in Shaker Heights, Ohio.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/07/obituaries/virginia-feller.html|title=Virginia Feller - Obituary|date=7 May 1981|accessdate=26 July 2012|agency=United Press International|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> In retirement, Feller lived with his wife, Anne Feller, in Gates Mills, a suburb of Cleveland.

In June 2009, at the age of 90, Feller was one of the starting pitchers at the inaugural [[Baseball Hall of Fame Classic]], which replaced the [[Doubleday Field|Hall of Fame Game]] at [[Cooperstown, New York]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/jun/20/bob-feller-still-starter/|title=Bob Feller still a starter|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Scripps Interactive Media Group|date=20 June 2009|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> Feller was treated for [[leukemia]] in August 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=5509574|title=Hall of Famer Bob Feller being treated for leukemia|accessdate=29 August 2010|accessdate=26 July 2012|agency=Associated Press|work=[[Espn.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}</ref> By October, Feller was fitted with a [[pacemaker]] and was diagnosed with [[pneumonia]] and [[Candidiasis|thrush]], an infection of the mucus membrane lining the mouth and throat.

Of Feller's death, Mike Hegan, Indians broadcaster and son of former Feller teammate and battery mate [[Jim Hegan]], stated, "The Indians of the 40's and 50's were the face of the city of Cleveland and Bob was the face of the Indians. But, Bob transcended more than that era. In this day of free agency and switching teams, Bob Feller remained loyal to the city and the team for over 70-years. You will likely not see that kind of mutual loyalty and admiration ever again."<ref>{{cite press release|date=15 December 2012|accessdate=4 May 4, 2012|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|work=[[Mlb.com]]|title=Indians mourn the passing of 'Rapid Robert' Bob Feller|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20101215&content_id=16328458&vkey=pr_cle&fext=.jsp&c_id=cle}}</ref> In 2010, the "Cleveland Indians Man of the Year Award" was renamed the "[[Bob Feller Man of the Year Award]].

On Opening Day of the 2011 season, the Indians invited Feller's widow, Anne, to present a silent first pitch. During pregame introductions, Cleveland players wore a No. 19-jersey in honor of Feller. For the entire 2011 season the players' uniforms were outfitted with an outline of Feller's pitching motion. The organization also made the press-box seat Feller would use when viewing games in his later years a permanent memorial.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/2011-03-24-975899190_x.htm|title=Indians honor Bob Feller on Opening Day, all year|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Company|date=24 March 2011|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>

The Feller bat used by Babe Ruth when he made his last public appearance at Yankee Stadium is at the museum. Feller said a teammate had stolen the bat and eventually it was purchased by the sports card company [[Upper Deck]] for $107,000. Feller later offered the company $95,000 in return for the bat.<ref name="Ruth" />
