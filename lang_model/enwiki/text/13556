'''Aldermaston''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+0254><U+02D0>ld<U+0259>rm<U+0251><U+02D0>st<U+0259>n}}) is a rural village, [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] and [[Wards of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] in [[Berkshire]], [[South East England]], with a population of 927. The village is on the southern edge of the [[River Kennet]] [[flood plain]], near the [[Hampshire]] county boundary. It is equidistant from [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]], [[Basingstoke]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of [[London]].

Aldermaston may have been inhabited as early as 1690 BC; a number of [[postholes]] &ndash; along with remains of cereal grains &ndash; have been found in the area. Written history of the village is traced back at least as far as the 9th century AD.  The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s show that the [[Ealdorman]] of Berkshire had his country estate in the village.  The manor of Aldermaston was established by the early 11th century, when the village was given to the [[Achard]] family by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]; the manor is documented in the [[Domesday survey]].  The [[Church of St Mary the Virgin, Aldermaston|village church]] was established in the 13th century, and some of the original [[Norman architecture]] remains in the building's structure.
The last resident Lord of the Manor, Charles Keyser, died in 1929.  The manor estate has been subsequently occupied by [[Associated Electrical Industries]], the [[United States Air Force]] [[XIX Tactical Air Command]], the [[Women's Land Army]], Collier Macmillan Schools, and [[Blue Circle Industries]].  The manor house is now run as a private corporate venue by the [[Compass Group]].

The name "Aldermaston" is synonymous with [[Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom|the UK's nuclear weapons programme]], as well as the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. The [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE), which develops, maintains, and disposes of the UK's nuclear weaponry is in the parish. Built on the site of the former [[RAF Aldermaston]], the plant has been the destination of numerous [[Aldermaston Marches]]. Until 2006, the village was home to the [[Aldermaston Pottery]], which was established by [[Alan Caiger-Smith]] and [[Geoffrey Eastop]] in 1955.

==History==
{{see also|Aldermaston Court#History of the estate}}

Evidence suggests that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century BC, possibly extending back to 1690 BC.<ref name="Cunliffe 2005 37">{{harvtxt|Cunliffe|2005|p=37}}</ref>  [[Radiocarbon dating]] on a number of [[postholes]] and pits found in the area show activity from 1690&ndash;1390, 1319&ndash;1214, and 977&ndash;899 BC.  Remains of cereal grains &ndash; both wheat and barley &ndash; have been found in these excavations.  Tests show that the majority of the barley was [[Husk#Husking and dehulling|dehulled]], but that absence of such debris may mean that the cereal was brought in from other areas.<ref name="Cunliffe 2005 37" />

Before the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 the land and properties of Aldermaston had formed part of the estates of England's foremost magnate, [[Harold Godwinson]], the [[Earl of Wessex]], who would later become [[King Harold II]] of England.<ref name="pageditchfield2" /> Harold's assessment of the village valued the village's 15 [[hide (unit)|hides]] at <U+00A3>20 a year.<ref name="pageditchfield2" /> As with much of the land seized by [[William the Conqueror]] after his arrival in England in 1066, Aldermaston was held in [[demesne]].<ref name="pageditchfield2" />  His [[Domesday Survey]] of 1086 identified the existence of a mill, worth twenty shillings, and two fisheries, worth five shillings.<ref name="Timmins 2000 6">{{harvtxt|Timmins|2000|p=6}}</ref> During the remainder of the reign of William, and later his son [[William Rufus]], Aldermaston was owned by the Crown. There is no evidence of there being a large house at that time.

The history of the [[Lords of the Manor]] of [[Aldermaston Court]] can be traced to Achard D'Aldermaston, who was born in 1036.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ford|2001}}</ref> Six families have had lordship of the Aldermaston estate.  In the 11th century, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] gave to Robert Achard (or Hachard<ref name="National Archives 1290">{{harvtxt|National Archives|1290}}</ref>) of [[Sparsholt, Oxfordshire|Sparsholt]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Camden|1610|p=63}}</ref><ref name="The Topographer 1789 33">{{harvtxt|Topographer, The|1789|p=33}}</ref> In the mid-12th century, the Achard family founded the church of St Mary the Virgin.<ref name="Campbell 1982 1">{{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=1}}</ref>  In 1292, [[Edward I]] granted the right for the lord of the manor to hold a market in the village. Another charter was granted by [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], with evidence that the market existed until approximately 1900.<ref name="pageditchfield2" /> The Achards also established an annual fair to observe the feast of [[Thomas More|St. Thomas the Martyr]] on 7 July.<ref name="pageditchfield2" />

Aldermaston was held by the [[Aldermaston Court#The Achard Family (11th century <U+2013> 1361)|Achard family]] until the 14th century, when it passed through marriage to Thomas De La Mare of [[Nunney Castle]], [[Somerset]].<ref name="The Topographer 1789 33" /><ref name="Timmins 2000 7">{{harvtxt|Timmins|2000|p=7}}</ref> The [[Aldermaston Court#The De la Mare Family (1361<U+2013>1490)|De La Mare family]] governed Aldermaston for approximately 120 years, until Elizabeth de la Mare &ndash; whose male relatives predeceased her &ndash; married into the Forster family.<ref name="Timmins 2000 7"/> In about 1636, the Forsters built a large [[manor house]] to the east of the church. The house was fronted by two porches, separated by a central section with seven [[Bay (architecture)|bays]].<ref name="Mowl Earnshaw 1995 63">{{harvtxt|Mowl|Earnshaw|1995|p=63}}</ref>  The porches had ornate [[Solomonic column]]s, similar to those at the [[University Church of St Mary the Virgin]] in Oxford.<ref name="Mowl Earnshaw 1995 63" />  The interior of the house featured a number of mythical statues,<ref name="Piozzi Bloom Bloom 1996 208">{{harvtxt|Piozzi|Bloom|Bloom|1996|p=208}}</ref> as well as artwork by [[Gaspard Dughet]], portraits of [[William Congreve]] and [[Godfrey Kneller]], and [[Tintoretto]]'s ''[[Esther]] Before [[Ahasuerus]]''.<ref name="Knight 1840 104">{{harvtxt|Knight|1840|p=104}}</ref>  The house's [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] garden featured patterns of groves and avenues of [[oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Spanish chestnut]] and [[lime tree]]s.<ref name="Martin 2005 65">{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=65}}</ref> In the early 18th century the Forsters oversaw the building of [[almshouse]]s in Church Road. Built by R Dixon in 1706, the houses became known as "Dixon's Cottages". The manor passed through the [[Aldermaston Court#The Forster Family (1490 - 1752)|Forster family]] until 1752, when the Forster lineage ended and the estate was inherited by [[Aldermaston Court#The Congreve family (1752 - 1843)|Ralph Congreve]] &ndash; the husband of the last Forster's grand-niece.

[[File:Aldermaston Manor.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of a grand Victorian manor house|[[Aldermaston Manor]] was built in the 1840s]]
On Ralph's death a second-cousin of dramatist [[William Congreve]] inherited the manor.<ref name="Wilson 1896">{{harvtxt|Wilson|1896}}</ref> The Congreve Family owned the estate at the time of the 1830 [[Swing Riot]]s. The rioters marched across Aldermaston, wrecking twenty-three agricultural machines. Workers were so frightened by the riots that they left their machinery in the open in an attempt to limit additional damage.<ref name="Ford 2005"/> Around the same time, the River Kennet (along the north side of the estate) was made navigable between Reading and Newbury.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kennet and Avon Canal Trust|2010}}</ref>

In 1843, the manor house was destroyed by fire, news of which was carried in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''.<ref name="Campbell 1982 1"/> The estate passed into the [[Court of Chancery]] and was purchased by [[Aldermaston Court#The Burr family (1849 - 1893)|Daniel Burr]].  In 1848, Burr commissioned the building of a neoclassical mansion to the south west of the original building.  Burr saved the 17th-century manor's wooden staircase, though all that remains of the building is a staircase to the cellar (which is now home to a colony of [[bat]]s).<ref name="Martin 2005 65"/> By 1851 the new building was complete, costing <U+00A3>20,000 and having a Tudor-like appearance.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pevsner|1966|p=45}}</ref> Burr held the estate until his death 50 years later, when was inherited by his son, who sold it in 1893.

[[File:NashAldermaston.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A monochrome lithograph of a grand wooden stair case|[[Joseph Nash]]'s 1849 lithograph of the staircase at Aldermaston Manor]]
The buyer was wealthy [[stockbroker]] [[Aldermaston Court#The Keyser family (1893 - 1938)|Charles Edward Keyser]], who was preoccupied with the idea of keeping the village unchanged &ndash; or, as he described it &ndash; "unspoilt".<ref name="Timmins 2000 11">{{harvtxt|Timmins|2000|p=11}}</ref> He forbade advertisements, opposed all modernisation and refused to allow any expansion by the building of houses. He did, however, commission the building of a parish hall in 1897 and provided the village with a water supply,<ref name="Aldermaston Parish Council 2007 1">{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2007|p=1}}</ref> and the water fountain on the small village green was installed to commemorate [[Victoria of the United Kingdom#Diamond Jubilee|Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee]]. Keyser oversaw the restoration of the village almshouses in 1906 and 1924, and defrayed the cost of a memorial oak tablet in memory of those killed in [[World War I]]. Of the 100 men from the village that served in [[World War I]], 22 were killed (the highest percentage of town population in the country). The tablet bears the name of each man lost in action.<ref name="Cox 1977 4">{{harvtxt|Cox|1977|p=4}}</ref> 

During Keyser's lordship, John Marius Wilson's ''[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]]'' listed ''Adminston'' as a possible name for the village.<ref name="Wilson 1896"/>   On his death in 1929, his wife, Mary, continued to occupy the house until she died in 1938.  The estate was auctioned off in September 1938, with many lots being purchased by their occupiers.  The manor house was bought by [[Associated Electrical Industries]] (AEI) for <U+00A3>16,000.<ref>{{harvtxt|Scott|2007|p=1}}</ref> One of the houses in the village is recorded as having fetched <U+00A3>1,375.<ref>{{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=2}}.</ref> As AEI's chairman, [[Felix Pole]] became the ''[[de jure]]'' Lord of the Manor upon their purchase of Aldermaston Court.<ref name="Timmins 2000 12">{{harvtxt|Timmins|2000|p=12}}</ref>

During the 1940s [[RAF Aldermaston]] was created on the parkland at the southern end of the parish, with [[XIX Tactical Air Command]] stationed at the manor house.<ref>{{harvtxt|Timmins|2000|p=14}}</ref> After [[World War II]], the manor was returned to AEI who built the [[MERLIN reactor]] on part of the land. The reactor was opened on 6 November 1959 by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=25}}</ref> With the opening of the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] (AWRE) in 1950, Aldermaston became synonymous with a number of [[Aldermaston Marches|CND marches]].<ref name="BBC News 2007">{{harvtxt|BBC News|2007}}</ref>

In 1953, Pole stepped down as Lord of the Manor and was succeeded by AEI's senior representative, [[Thomas Allibone]]. Allibone held the position for 32 years, until [[Blue Circle Industries]] acquired the estate in 1985.<ref>{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2007a|p=15}}</ref> Allibone was succeeded by Tony Jackson.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=63}}</ref> Blue Circle could not gain [[planning permission]] in the grounds of the court, so the MERLIN reactor was demolished to make way for [[Portland House, Aldermaston|Portland House]].  With a full redevelopment of Aldermaston Manor, the <U+00A3>14 million office development &ndash; which would be Blue Circle's international headquarters &ndash; was opened by [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=66}}</ref>

=== Toponymy ===
The village of Aldermaston derives its name from ''<U+00C6>ldremanestone'', ''Eldremanestune'' or ''Hedlremanestone'', the [[Old English]] for "Ealdorman's Homestead".<ref name="Aldermaston Parish Council 2007a 1">{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2007a|p=1}}</ref> The [[Ealdorman]] &ndash; or [[Alderman]] &ndash; was a person of extreme importance, equating to the modern-day [[Lord-Lieutenant]] of the County. Although his country estate was in Aldermaston, he would have spent most of the time in the original county town of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]].<ref name="Ford 2005">{{harvtxt|Ford|2005}}</ref> The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] states that the first known Ealdorman of Berkshire, Aethelwulf, fought the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] with [[Ethelred of Wessex]] at nearby [[Englefield, Berkshire|Englefield]] in 871.

==Governance==
Historically, Aldermaston was a [[Hundred (county subdivision)#England|hundred]], though for a period it was within the Theale hundred.<ref name="Youngs 1979 14">{{harvtxt|Youngs|1979|p=14}}</ref> By the 19th century, the hundreds had been superseded by other sub-divisions.  From then on, Aldermaston was, at times, part of the [[Bradfield, Berkshire|Bradfield]] [[Poor Law Union]] and [[Sanitary District]], and the registration sub-districts of Mortimer (late 19th century) and Bucklebury (early 20th century).<ref name="Youngs 1979 14"/> It was later an [[Parish#Ecclesiastical parish|ecclesiastical parish]].<ref name="Youngs 1979 14"/>

Aldermaston is now a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of [[West Berkshire]] [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]]. The [[Wards of the United Kingdom|electoral ward]] of Aldermaston includes the neighbouring parishes of [[Wasing]], [[Brimpton]], [[Midgham]], and [[Woolhampton]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{harvtxt|Office of National Statistics|2010a}}</ref> The ward is the smallest in [[West Berkshire]] by population.<ref>{{harvtxt|West Berkshire Council|2007a}}</ref> The ward's [[councillor]] is Irene Neill, who represents the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].<ref>{{harvtxt|West Berkshire Council|2010b}}</ref>

Aldermaston is under the catchment of [[Thames Valley Police]] and is covered by the Brimpton Neighbourhood Policing Team.<ref>{{harvtxt|West Berkshire Council|2010a}}</ref> In a meeting with Aldermaston Parish Council, the police reported that 57 criminal offences were reported to have taken place in the parish between 2009 and 2010.<ref name="Newbury Today 2010">{{harvtxt|Newbury Today|2010}}</ref> Of this, the majority was theft from non-dwelling properties. Vehicle crime had dropped by 57% on the previous year but [[violent crime]] had risen from four to six incidents. Five of these crimes were reported to be [[domestic violence]].  There have been no reported cases of [[robbery]] in Aldermaston since 2006.<ref name="Newbury Today 2010"/>

==Geography==
[[File:AldermastonLoosey.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a small village green, showing a drinking fountain, oak tree, and well|The Loosey with the fountain (left) and well (to the right of the oak tree) visible]]
Aldermaston is in West Berkshire, about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the Hampshire boundary. The village is {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4 road]] that links the parish with Newbury and Reading. The main road in Aldermaston, The Street, is part of the [[A340 road]] and links the village with [[Pangbourne]] and Basingstoke. The course of [[Ermin Street]], the [[Roman road]] that linked [[Calleva Atrebatum]] ([[Silchester]]) with [[Glevum]] ([[Gloucester]]) ''via'' [[Corinium Dobunnorum]] ([[Cirencester]]) runs south of the village, but none of the road survives in the area.<ref>{{harvtxt|Streetmap|2010}}</ref>

At the southern end of The Street is a small triangular [[village green]] called The Loosey. The Loosey is the site of a Roman well, discovered in 1940 by a cow that almost fell down it.<ref name="Timmins 2000 11"/> The Loosey was previously home to the village [[maypole]] (which was often climbed by Daniel Burr's monkey) and a drinking fountain erected by Charles Keyser to celebrate the [[Victoria of the United Kingdom#Diamond Jubilee|Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria]].<ref name="Timmins 2000 11"/> Although no longer in use, the drinking fountain remains intact on the Loosey.

The [[River Kennet]] and [[River Enborne]] flow through the parish.  The confluence of the rivers is approximately {{convert|0.6|mi|km}} north of the village.<ref name="floodreport3">{{harvtxt|West Berkshire Council|2007b|p=3}}</ref>  The [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] forms part of the parish's boundaries with [[Woolhampton]] and [[Padworth]].

Sections of [[Grim's Bank]] are in the parish. Part of the earthwork in the AWE complex survives at a height of {{convert|3.3|m|ft}} and with a ditch {{convert|0.9|m|ft}} deep.<ref>{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2007b}}</ref>

===Geology===
The landscape of Aldermaston is influenced by Paices Hill and Rag Hill, which are extremities of the chalk formation the [[North Wessex Downs]] as part of the Thames Basin Heaths.<ref>{{harvtxt|North Wessex Downs AONB|2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Joint Nature Conservation Committee|2010}}</ref>  The topography of the land in the parish generally slopes northward to the River Kennet.<ref name="floodreport3" />

===Flooding===

The geology and location of Aldermaston has resulted in severe flooding on three occasions &ndash; 1971, 1989, and 2007.<ref name="Newbury Today 2008">{{harvtxt|Newbury Today|2008}}</ref><ref name="Martin 2005 85">{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=85}}</ref> The flood in 1971 was caused by torrential rain flooding the [[balancing pond]]s [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]], which were unable to cope with the rainfall.<ref name="Martin 2005 85"/> This happened again in July 1989, when {{convert|6|in|mm}} of rain was deposited on the village in two hours.  Five feet of water built up from the ponds, and broke through a brick wall, flooding the village. The destroyed wall was rebuilt with 17 grilles to avoid another build-up of water.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=88}}</ref> A donation of <U+00A3>10,000 was given to the village by [[Blue Circle]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=89}}</ref>

In July 2007, torrential rain flooded the village and local primary school, with the event making national news.<ref name="harvtxt|Newbury Today|2007a">{{harvtxt|Newbury Today|2007a}}</ref> The storm coincided with the annual [[The Glade|Glade music festival]] and jeopardised the event.<ref>{{harvtxt|Newbury Today|2007b}}</ref> The festival gates were temporarily closed while organisers assessed the flooding, which submerged one of the stages.<ref name="Virtual Festivals 2007">{{harvtxt|Virtual Festivals|2007}}</ref> The festival's car park was incapacitated, with thousands of revellers stranded in the village and surrounding lanes.<ref>{{harvtxt|BBC Berkshire|2007b}}</ref>

Ian Henderson, a [[police constable]] at [[Thames Valley Police]] stated that the emergency services were "really stretched because of what happened over the county and the Glade event", that "the [A340] junction was two or three foot under water", and predicted that "a lot of householders [would be] homeless."<ref name="harvtxt|Newbury Today|2007a"/>

==Economy==
Historically, the main source of industry in Aldermaston has been agriculture.  According to the 1831 census, approximately 66% of working men (aged 20 and over) were employed in some form of agriculture.<ref name="GBHS 2010c">{{harvtxt|Great Britain Historical GIS|2010c}}</ref> The next highest industry by workers was "retail and handicrafts", which employed approximately 20%.<ref name="GBHS 2010c" /> Employment categories in the 1881 census were more discreet; just 20% of working men identified their employment as agriculture.  30% however, were listed as "general or unspecified commodities".<ref name="GBHS 2010c" />  In this census, women's employment was also documented.  Of the 137 working women in the parish, 40 (slightly fewer than 30%) worked in domestic services, whereas 82 (approximately 60%) were of an unknown occupation.<ref name="GBHS 2010c" />

===Agriculture===
In about 1797<ref name="Martin 2005 3">{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=3}}</ref> a schoolmaster living in the village cultivated the [[Williams pear]]. The schoolmaster &ndash; either Mr Wheeler<ref name="Martin 2005 3"/> or his successor, John Stair<ref>{{harvtxt|USA Pears|2009}}</ref> &ndash; was the original cultivator, but the pear (a [[cultivar]] of the [[European Pear]]) was named after Richard Williams of [[Turnham Green]], who grew several grafts of the original tree.<ref name="Martin 2005 3"/> On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the tree was unveiled on the wall of the village school.<ref name="Martin 2005 3"/>

Locally-farmed wheat was milled at Aldermaston Mill until the 1920s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|1977|p=6}}</ref> In existence at the time of the Domesday survey, the mill was previously called the "Kingsmill", and at one time supplied [[flour]] to [[Huntley & Palmers]] in Reading.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=53}}</ref> Now known as The Old Mill, it was owned by Wasing's Mount family throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.  William Mount let the mill to Francis Webb (1797<U+2013>1811), Mr Sherwood (1811<U+2013>1820), Mr King (1820<U+2013>1824), Mr Waldren (1824<U+2013>1828), Mr Mathews (1828<U+2013>1848), and William Gilchrist (1848<U+2013>1856).<ref name="Mill1">{{harvtxt|Old Mill, The|2010|p=1}}</ref>  Gilchrist (Mathews' business partner) bought the mill from Mount in 1856 using money inherited from his brother's death the previous year.<ref name="Mill2">{{harvtxt|Old Mill, The|2010|p=2}}</ref> Owning it outright for approximately a year, he drowned in the River Kennet in 1857 after visiting the Angel public house in Woolhampton.<ref name="Mill2" /> Joseph Crockett purchased the mill in an auction the same year, before it was acquired by a  Richard Sisling of [[Godalming]] in 1858.  In approximately 1860, the mill was purchased by the Kersley family.  Between then and 1885, it was operated by Anthony Kersley, a miller and [[malster]] who employed "six men and a boy, a carter, several domestic servants and a governess".<ref name="Mill2" />  Kersley's son, also named Anthony, ran the mill until 1895.  That year, Walter Parson bought the mill and operated it until approximately 1897.  Charles Keyser subsequently oversaw restoration on the mill building which "had been untenanted for upwards of three years".  He let the mill out to a Mr Iremonger from 1901.  Iremonger used the mill until the late 1920s, shortly before Keyser's death.<ref name="Mill2" />  After Keyser had died and the Aldermaston estate had been divided and sold, his widow, Mary, approached Evelyn Arlott to run the mill as a [[tea room]] and [[guesthouse]].  The Arlott family purchased the mill in approximately 1939, after the death of Mary Keyser.<ref name="Mill5">{{harvtxt|Old Mill, The|2010|p=5}}</ref>

In 1939, there were seven farms on the Aldermaston estate &ndash; Forsters Farm, Village Farm, Church Farm, Upper Church Farm, Raghill Farm, Park Farm, and Soke Farm. These accounted for approximately 75% of the estate's land.<ref name="Scott 2007 6">{{harvtxt|Scott|2007|p=6}}</ref> Aside from these, there were six [[smallholding]]s within the parish but outside the land owned by the court. These were Springhill Farm, Court Farm, Strawberry Farm, Circus Farm, Ravenswing Farm, and Frouds Farm.<ref name="Scott 2007 6"/>

Of these, only two farms remain in operation &ndash; Church Farm and Forster's Farm.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bucknell|1965}}</ref> Upper Church Farm was originally known as Harry's Farm, after a William Harry who died in 1544.<ref>{{harvtxt|Cox|1977|p=12}}</ref>

===Pubs and brewing===
The local [[pub]] is named The Hind's Head in honour of the Forster family crest. Built in the 17th century and originally operating as a [[coaching inn]],<ref name="Reader's Digest Association 1990 18">{{harvtxt|Reader's Digest Association|1990|p=18}}</ref> the establishment was named The Pack Horse during the De La Mare and Forster lordships and The Congreve Arms throughout the Congreves' ownership.<ref name="Aldermaston Parish Council 2007 3">{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2007|p=3}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Ingram|Ingram|Ridley|1976|p=48}}</ref>
[[File:HindsHead.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of a public house|The Hind's Head Inn]]
The building has a large black and gold clock set into the [[gable]], and a small bellturret upon which is a [[Gilding|gilt]] fox-shaped [[weather vane]].<ref name="Reader's Digest Association 1990 18"/> The bell was intended to be rung as an [[Civil defense siren|air-raid siren]] during the Second World War.<ref name="Ingram 1976 49">{{harvtxt|Ingram|Ingram|Ridley|1976|p=49}}</ref> In the early 19th century the pub's [[signboard]] carried the arms of the Congreve family, as well as branding for a company named "Adams". In the ''British Parliamentary Papers'' of 1817, the Committee on the State of the Police in the Metropolis reported evidence of a John Adams &ndash; a Reading-based [[distiller]] and [[hops|hop merchant]], who competed for business against [[Simonds' Brewery]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Corley|1976|p=79}}</ref> By 1850, the pub brewed beer on-site; a brewery was built as an out-building behind the main pub building. John Knight produced beer at the pub for 40 years, selling it for [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|2d]]. The brewery building is still in existence, with the wooden [[Louver|louvres]] still operational.<ref name="Ingram 1976 49"/> The building is now the pub's kitchen. In the 1970s, the pub was owned by [[Whitbread]].<ref name="Ingram 1976 49"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=43}}</ref> In the mid-1990s the pub was taken over by [[Gales Brewery]] (having previously been a [[Free house (pub)|free house]]), later becoming tied to [[Fuller's Brewery]] on their acquisition of Gales in 2006.<ref>{{harvtxt|Klinger|2005}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Portsmouth Today|2006}}</ref> In the 1970s, the pub was home to the Kennet Folk Club.<ref name="Ingram 1976 49"/>

The pub has its own gaol-house, the lock-up, at the rear. Built out of red brick, the small single-storey building has a shallow domed roof.  The inside of the lock-up measures approximately {{convert|7.5|ft|m}} by {{convert|6|ft|m}}, and is enclosed by a studded door with a grille.<ref name="hod_lockup">{{harvtxt|Heritage Open Days|2010a}}</ref>  It was last used in 1865 and its drunk inhabitant burnt himself to death trying to keep warm.<ref name="Aldermaston Parish Council 2007 3"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=2}}</ref> The lock-up was designated as a [[Grade II]] listed building in April 1967.<ref>{{harvtxt|Images of England|2007a}}</ref> On 11 September 2010 the lock-up was opened to the public as part of the [[Heritage Open Days]] scheme.<ref name="hod_lockup" />

Another pub in the parish, The Butt Inn, is located approximately {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} north-east of the village.<ref>{{harvtxt|Waterscape|2010a}}</ref> The pub is named after the [[archery butts]] that were located in the fields opposite the pub.<ref name="Wordsworth Reference 2006 68">{{harvtxt|Wordsworth Reference|2006|p=68}}</ref>

The [[Aldermaston Brewery]] was established at [[Aldermaston Wharf]] in 1770, and was demolished in the 1950s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Berkshire Record Office|2010}}</ref> It was replaced with a cable factory, which was demolished in 1990.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=114}}</ref>

===Cricket bats===
Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) is now the location of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local [[willow]] for the production of [[cricket bat]]s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2006|p=5}}</ref> The trees are grown at Harbour Hill Copse,<ref name="ReferenceC">{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2010b}}</ref> where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose.  There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time.<ref>{{harvtxt|Padworth Parish Council|2010}}</ref> The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shaps, then cure the wood in a kiln.  The clefts of wood are then shipped to [[India]] where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

The yard would take on three up-coming cricketers for the winter, in the hope that the hard work would "toughen them up" to get them picked for the [[England cricket team]]. One year the yard had help from [[Frank Tyson]], [[Alan Moss]], and [[Peter Loader]]. The following year they hosted three Davids &ndash; David Kaufman, David Spragbury, and [[David Gibson (cricketer)|David Gibson]].<ref name="Martin 2005 38">{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=38}}</ref>

The wood yard was featured on ''[[A Question of Sport]]'', when cricketer [[Graham Gooch]] took part in the programme's "Mystery Guest" round.<ref name="Martin 2005 50">{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=50}}</ref> Gooch endorsed the bats made from Aldermaston willow, which were sold by [[Surridge]]. When he scored 333 runs against India at [[Lord's]] in the 1990 [[Test cricket|test season]], the Turbo 333 bat, made from Aldermaston wood, was launched in his honour.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=92}}</ref>

In the 1960s, ''[[Blue Peter]]'' aired a short documentary on the cricket bat production entitled "The Life of a Cricket Bat".  It was presented by [[Christopher Trace]].<ref name="Martin 2005 38"/>

===Pottery===
In 1955, the [[Aldermaston Pottery]] was established on the main street<ref name="Studio Pottery 2006">{{harvtxt|Studio Pottery|2006}}</ref> by [[studio potter]]s [[Alan Caiger-Smith]] and [[Geoffrey Eastop]].<ref name="Studio Pottery 2006"/> The pottery was renowned for [[Tin-glazed pottery|tin-glazed]] and [[porcelain]] wares,<ref name="Studio Pottery 2006"/>  which used scrap wood from the Village Farm woodyard to fire the kiln.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=36}}</ref>
The pottery closed in 2006.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ceramic Review|2006}}</ref> It had previously scaled back its output in 1993 due to Caiger-Smith's partial retirement after the [[Early 1990s recession|1992 recession]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=116}}</ref>

===Other businesses===

The [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE), for which Aldermaston has become known,<ref name="BBC News 2000">{{harvtxt|BBC News|2000}}</ref> is less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of the village. In April 1958, the first [[Aldermaston March]] was held.<ref name="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament 2008">{{harvtxt|Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|2008}}</ref> The march saw around 3,000 protesters march from London to Aldermaston over four days, with a total attendance of 12,000 at the establishment's gates.<ref name="Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament 2008"/> The 50th anniversary of the event was marked on 24 March 2008 with the "Bomb Stops Here" protest, attended by [[Vivienne Westwood]] and [[CND]] president [[Walter Wolfgang]].<ref>{{harvtxt|BBC News|2008}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Guardian, The|2008}}</ref> The 2008 demonstration was the biggest protest staged by CND in ten years.<ref>{{harvtxt|Barnett|2008}}</ref>
Until 2005, AWE discharged "pre-treated waste water"<ref name="AWE 2011">{{harvtxt|AWE|2011}}</ref> into the River Thames at [[Pangbourne]] via an {{convert|11.8|mi|km}} pipeline which runs under roads and fields within the parish.<ref name="Nuclear Information Service 2003">{{harvtxt|Nuclear Information Service|2003}}</ref> A water processing facility was installed on-site in 2006, though the Pangbourne Pipeline remains ''in situ''.<ref name="AWE 2011" />

[[Lafarge Aggregates]] owns varios sites in the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against [[Pioneer Concrete]]'s application for [[gravel extraction]] near the village.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=46}}</ref> Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of gravel extraction by Lafarge.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martin|Braithwaite|Jeffcoate|Girling|2005|p=188}}</ref> Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by [[West Berkshire Council]]. A further application to extract aggregate at the [[Wasing Estate]] is due to be decided in 2010.<ref name="Newbury Today 2008"/> One former extraction site, [[Butts Lake Quarry]], is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes have been identified as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] and is now operated by the [[Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Aldermaston Parish Council|2005}}</ref> The reserve contains specimens of trees such as [[alder]], [[cherry tree|cherry]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[oak]], and [[willow]].  Examples of [[Reed (plant)|reed]]s present include ''[[typha latifolia]]'', ''[[phragmites australis]]'', ''[[mentha aquatica]]'', and ''[[lythrum salicaria]]''.  Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the [[common teal]], [[shoveler]], [[warbler]], [[kingfisher]], [[water rail]], and [[nightingale]].<ref>{{harvtxt|English Nature|2006|p=1}}</ref>
