'''John Davies Cale''' (born [[March 9]], [[1942]]) is a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[musician]], [[songwriter]] and [[record producer]]. He is best known for his work in [[Rock and roll|rock music]], particularly as a founding member of the [[Velvet Underground]], and he has worked in a variety of styles over the years.  

==Early life and career==

Cale was born in [[Garnant]] in the heavily industrial Amman Valley, and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] is his first language.  Having discovered a talent for [[piano]], he studied music at [[Goldsmiths College]], the [[University of London]], where he famously stayed in room E14 Raymont Hall (in [[Brockley]]). He then travelled to the [[United States|USA]] to continue his musical training, thanks to the help and influence of [[Aaron Copland]]. 

Arriving at [[New York City]], he met a number of influential composers. With [[John Cage]] and several others, Cale participated in an 18-hour piano-playing marathon that was the first full-length performance of [[Erik Satie]]'s "[[Vexations#First public performance|Vexations]]". More significantly, Cale played in [[La Monte Young]]'s ensemble the [[Theater of Eternal Music]] (also known as the Dream Syndicate, which should not be confused with the 1980s band of the same name). The heavily drone-laden music he played there proved to be a big influence in his work with his next group, the Velvet Underground.

[[Image:Velvet_Underground.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Velvet Underground (and Nico) in 1966, L-R: [[John Cale]], [[Nico]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Sterling Morrison]], [[Maureen Tucker]]]]
In [[1965 in music|1965]], he joined [[Lou Reed]] in the newly-formed [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]], but left in [[1968 in music|1968]], due in part to creative disagreements with Reed.

Cale appears on the Velvet Underground's first two albums, ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'' and ''[[White Light/White Heat]]'', besides Nico's first album, ''[[Chelsea Girl (album)|Chelsea Girl]]'', considered by some mostly a Velvet album. On the debut and ''White Light/White Heat'', he sings on a few songs, plays [[viola]], [[bass guitar]], [[piano]] and [[organ (music)|organ]] (particularly on "[[Sister Ray]]") and co-wrote some of the material, but perhaps his most distinctive contributions are the electrically amplified viola drones which add greatly to the overall atmosphere of the records.

He is said to have influenced the sound of the early V.U. much more than any other members (and often disagreed with Reed about the direction the group should take). When Cale left the group, he seemed to take the more experimentalist tendencies with him, as is arguably noticeable in comparing the noise-rock experimental ''[[White Light/White Heat]]'' that Cale co-created with the calmer ''[[The Velvet Underground (album)|The Velvet Underground]]'', recorded after his departure. It is also claimed that the change in sound was due to the band's equipment being stolen at an airport.

For years, a story he told about being in the studio when [[Van Morrison]]'s ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' was recorded, was repeated as an honest assessment: "Morrison couldn't work with anybody, so finally they just shut him in the studio by himself. He did all the songs with just an acoustic guitar, and later they overdubbed the rest of it around his tapes."  This story was still being told in [[1979 in music|1979]], when famed journalist [[Lester Bangs]] repeated it in his article on ''Astral Weeks'' in "Stranded." Over the years, the story has been shown to be untrue.   

Three albums of his early experimental work were released in 2001. One of his collaborators on these recordings was Velvets' guitarist [[Sterling Morrison]].

==Later career==
===1970s===
After leaving the Velvet Underground, Cale produced a number of albums, including [[Nico]]'s ''[[The Marble Index (album)|The Marble Index]]'' and [[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges' debut]], and began to make solo records. His first, ''Vintage Violence'' came in 1970, following which he collaborated with yet another classical musician, [[Terry Riley]], on the mainly instrumental ''[[Church of Anthrax]]''. Cale also appeared on [[Nick Drake]]'s second album, ''[[Bryter Layter]]'', playing viola and harpsichord on two of the album's tracks. His solo record of 1973, ''[[Paris 1919 (album)|Paris 1919]]'', is regarded by many as a classic. It is made up of elegantly crafted and tastefully arranged songs with arcane and complex lyrics, apparently with underlying political concerns.

Cale also continued to work as a [[record producer]]. In 1974, he joined [[Island Records]], and worked in that capacity with [[Squeeze]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Sham 69]], among others. On his production of [[Nico]]'s ''[[The End (Nico album)|The End]]'' he played a wide array of instruments to unique effect. He produced a number of important [[protopunk]] records, including debuts by [[Patti Smith]], [[The Stooges]] and [[The Modern Lovers]].  During this period, he also worked as a talent scout with Island's [[A&R]] department.

Moving back to the [[United Kingdom]], Cale made a series of solo albums which moved in a new direction. The tasteful elegance of his earlier records was now replaced by a dark and threatening aura, often carrying a sense of barely-suppressed aggression. A trilogy of albums - ''[[Fear (John Cale album)|Fear]]'', ''[[Slow Dazzle]]'', and ''[[Helen of Troy (album)|Helen of Troy]]'' were recorded with other [[Island Records|Island]] artists including [[Phil Manzanera]] and [[Brian Eno]] of [[Roxy Music]], and [[Chris Spedding]] who featured in his live band. This era of Cale's music is perhaps best represented by his somewhat disturbing cover of [[Elvis Presley]]s' iconic "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", featured both on ''Slow Dazzle'' and the live album ''[[June 1, 1974]]'', recorded with [[Kevin Ayers]], [[Nico]] and [[Brian Eno|Eno]], and by his frothing performance on "Leaving It Up To You", a savage indictment of the [[mass media]] first released on ''[[Helen of Troy (album)|Helen of Troy]]'' (1975), but quickly deleted from later editions of the record due perhaps to the song's pointed [[Sharon Tate]] reference. It's also worth noting that both "Leaving" and "Fear Is A Man's Best Friend" (from ''Fear'') began as relatively conventional songs that both gradually grow more paranoid in tone before breaking down into what critic Dave Thompson calls "a morass of discordance and screaming."[http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=33:6srsa9qgi2hs] His often loud, abrasive and confrontational live performances fitted well with the nascent [[punk rock]] developing on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Cale took to wearing a [[hockey]] [[goalie]]'s mask onstage; see the cover of the ''[[Guts (John Cale album)|Guts]]'' compilation (1977). It was a very odd and menacing look, utilized several years before the fictional [[Jason Voorhees]] first appeared on screen and made the goalie's mask all but synonymous with evil. During one gig he chopped the head off a dead chicken with a meat cleaver, and his band walked offstage in protest. Cale's drummer--a vegetarian--was so bothered he quit the group. Cale mocks his decision on "Chicken Shit" from the ''Animal Justice'' EP. Cale has admitted that some of his paranoia and erratic behaviour at this time was associated with heavy [[cocaine]] use.<ref>Mitchell, Tim ''Sedition and Alchemy : A Biography of John Cale'', 2003,  ISBN 0720611326</ref> 

===1980s===
In 1982, Cale released the sparse ''[[Music For A New Society]]''. Seeming to blend the refined music of his early solo work with the threatening music that came later, it is by any standard a bleak, harrowing record. It's been called "understated, and perhaps a masterpiece." [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:38q5g4httv8z~T1]

Having married Rise Irushalmi and had his daughter Eden Cale, he took a long break from performing, making a comeback in 1989 with vocal and orchestral settings of poems by [[Dylan Thomas]], most notably, "[[Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night]]", which he performed on stage in the concert held in Cardiff in 1999 to celebrate the opening of the [[Welsh Assembly]]. The music was recorded in 1992, on an [[Brian Eno|Eno]] produced album: ''[[Words for the Dying]]'' - perhaps the closest Cale has come to conventional classical music.

===1990s and beyond===
In 1990, he collaborated with [[Brian Eno|Eno]] on an album entitled ''[[Wrong Way Up]]''. One of the songs, "Lay My Love" was on the [[Northern Exposure]] soundtrack ''More Music From Northern Exposure'' released in 1994.  Cale covered [[Leonard Cohen]]'s song "[[Hallelujah (song)|Hallelujah]]" on the 1991 tribute album ''[[I'm Your Fan]]''. Cale's cover of "Hallelujah" was used in the 1996 film, [[Basquiat]], and the 2001 film, ''[[Shrek]]'', in the latter film one line of the lyric ("Maybe there's a God above") was edited from the song; however, [[Rufus Wainwright]]'s performance of the song was included on the film's official soundtrack instead of Cale's. It is however included in the official soundtrack for the TV-series [[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]. 

In 1992, Cale performed vocals on the song "First Evening" on French producer [[Hector Zazou]]'s album ''Sahara Blue''. All lyrics on the album were based on the poetry of author [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. In 1994, Cale performed a spoken word duet with [[Suzanne Vega]] on the song "The Long Voyage" on Zazou's album ''[[Chansons des mers froides]]''. The lyrics were based on the poem "Silhouettes" by author [[Oscar Wilde]] and Cale co-wrote the music with Zazou. It was later released as a single (retitled "The Long Voyages" as it featured several remixes by Zazou, [[Mad Professor]], and more). 

''[[Songs for Drella]]'', a tribute to one-time Velvet Underground manager [[Andy Warhol]], saw him reunited with [[Lou Reed|Reed]], a collaboration which eventually led to the brief reunion of the Velvet Underground in 1993. ''Nico'', an instrumental ballet score and tribute to [[Nico|the singer]] was performed by Scapino Rotterdam plus an added selection from ''[[The Marble Index]]'' in 1998, with the score released as ''[[Dance Music]]''. Cale has also written a number of [[film soundtrack]]s, often using more [[european classical music|classically]] influenced instrumentation. Cale's autobiography, ''What's Welsh for Zen?'', was published in 1999.

With 2003's E.P. ''[[Five Tracks]]'' and the album ''[[HoboSapiens]]'', John Cale again returned as a regular recording artist, this time with music influenced by modern [[electronica]] and [[alternative rock]]. The well received album was co-produced with [[Nick Franglen]] of [[Lemon Jelly]]. That record was again followed with 2005's album ''[[BlackAcetate]]'', which consolidated John Cale's reputation as a versatile and tirelessly innovative music auteur.
