==Plot Details==
Poirot boards the Orient Express, which is unusually crowded. After a pleasant dinner and retiring to his bed, a murder is committed. M. Ratchett was murdered that night, but who did it?  Poirot agrees to find out.

Poirot finds several clues in the victim's cabin and on board the coach, suggesting that the murderer or murderers were somewhat sloppy; however, each clue seemingly points to different suspects.  Poirot soon discovers that M. Ratchett was in fact a notorious fugitive from U.S. justice named Cassetti.  Some years earlier, Cassetti had kidnapped three-year-old heiress Daisy Armstrong.  Though the Armstrong family paid a huge ransom for Daisy's release, Cassetti murdered the little girl anyway and fled the country with the money. Daisy's mother, Sonia Armstrong was pregnant when she heard of Daisy's death.  Her child died prematurely.  She herself died as a result of the shock.  Her husband, Col. Armstrong shot himself out of grief. Daisy's maid, Susanne, was suspected by the police, despite her hysterics. She threw herself out of the window and died.

One of the crucial clues is provided by Mary who happens to travel on the same train as Poirot on the way to the Orient express.  Mary is very worried about delay on this first train, but is unconcerned when the Orient express itself is delayed.  Poirot is able to conclude that there was a preplanned meeting on the Orient express.

As the evidence mounts, it continues to point in wildly different directions. A critical piece of missing evidence -- a red [[kimono]] worn the night of the murder by an unknown woman briefly witnessed in the coach corridor by Poirot and others -- turns up in Poirot's own luggage.  Poirot discovers that some passengers had a connection to the victim, while others a connection to the Armstrong family.  After meditating on the evidence for some time, Poirot assembles the thirteen suspects, plus M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine, in the restaurant car where he lays out two possible explanations of Ratchett's murder.

The Armstrong case was based on the actual kipnapping of [[Charles Lindbergh]] son.

===The Denouement===
In the first scenario, explains Poirot, a stranger entered the train during the previous stop at [[Vinkovci|Vincovci]], murdered Ratchett for reasons unknown, and escaped unnoticed.  The crime occurred an hour earlier than everyone believed owing to the victim and several others failing to note that the train had just crossed [[Time zone|time zones]].  The other noises heard by Poirot on the coach that evening were unrelated to the murder.

In the second scenario, Poirot explains painstakingly, ''all'' of the suspects were guilty, as there was no other way the murder could have taken place under the evidence.  Poirot reveals that the other passengers, most of whom were traveling under assumed names, were in fact members of the extended Armstrong family, or had a very close tie to the family or its servants.  All had been gravely wounded by Daisy's murder.  They took it into their own hands to serve as Cassetti's executioners to avenge a crime the law was unable to punish.  Each of the suspects stabbed Ratchett once, so that no one could know who delivered the fatal blow.  Twelve of the conspirators participated to allow for a "12-person jury", with only Countess Andrenyi not participating as she would have been the most likely suspect (as Daisy's aunt). One extra berth was booked under a fictitious name (the cabin next to Ratchett was already reserved for a director of the company) so no one other than the conspirators and the victim would be on the train that night.  The unexpected stoppage in the snowbank, and the fact that the carriage company had allowed the famous Poirot to sleep in the cabin that had been reserved for the fictitious person, caused complications to the conspirators that resulted in several crucial clues being left behind.  As Poirot reveals the details of the elaborate plot, many of the suspects (among them Daisy's aunt and grandmother) break down in tears.

Poirot agrees to let Dr. Constantine and M.Bouc decide which of his two theories is correct.  After a brief pause, both state softly that the first explanation seems far the more plausible, and is the one they will give to the police when the freed train reaches the next station.  The thirteen suspects are allowed to walk free, and the true circumstances of Ratchett's death presumably remain secret forever.
