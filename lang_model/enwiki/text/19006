==Italian scandals==
Itera is being suspected to have business connections with the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Cosa Nostra]], a crime syndicate. Mafia Don [[Massimo Ciancimino]] stated in a 2005 deposition in Italian courts that he met up with Igor Makarov in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], trying to organize a deal to use mob money to set up a gas distribution network to "broaden his business interests".<ref>Steve Scherer: "The Mafia's Energy Grab", [[Bloomberg Markets]], January 2007, pp.96-106</ref>

==U.S. scandals==
In March 2002, the [[U.S. Trade and Development Agency]] cancelled a $868,000 grant to Itera as questions were raised about its legitimacy. In May, Representative [[Curt Weldon]] led a congressional delegation to Russia and visited Itera. After his return, he publicly supported Itera's efforts. In the beginning of September of that year, Itera paid the expenses for a Weldon trip to NYC. The following week, Itera told Karen Weldon, the Congressman's daughter, it would sign a contract with her newly-formed lobbying firm, Solutions North America, Inc. On September 24, Curt Weldon co-hosted an event at the Library of Congress honoring Itera's chairman. On September 26, Weldon gave a floor speech praising Itera. On September 30, SNA received a $500,000 annual contract with Itera, with $170,000 up front. In November, Itera paid for Karen to join Rep. Weldon on a trip to Eastern Europe and Russia. In January 2003, Itera opened U.S. offices in Jacksonville, Florida, and paid for Rep. Weldon to attend the opening.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/classified/jobs/news/la-na-weldon20feb20,0,7326482.story?coll=la-class-employ-jobnews Lucrative Deals for a Daughter of Politics], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 20, 2004.</ref>
