'''''Bleach''''' is the debut album by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. It was released on June 15, 1989 through the [[independent record label]] [[Sub Pop]]. The main recording sessions took place at Reciprocal Recording in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] between December 1988 and January 1989. The band's songwriter [[Kurt Cobain]] felt pressured to create music for ''Bleach'' that conformed to the [[grunge]] music style favored by his record label and the contemporary Seattle music scene. The album is regarded as quite negative and bleak, and Cobain, the primary writer of the songs, claimed that 80 percent of the lyrics were written the night before recording while he was feeling "pissed off", and he did not regard them highly. The recording of the album was financed by [[Jason Everman]], who was credited as a guitarist but did not play on any songs.

''Bleach'' was well received by critics, with many reviews giving the album three or more stars out of five. The album was later re-released in 1992 following the success of Nirvana's second album, ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991), with [[Geffen Records]] handling the international release. The re-release debuted at number 89 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'', and peaked at number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It has since sold over one million units in the United States. In 2009, Sub Pop released a 20th anniversary edition of ''Bleach'' featuring a live recording of a Nirvana show from 1990 as extra material.

==Recording==
Following the release of the band's debut single "[[Love Buzz]]" on Sub Pop in November 1988, Nirvana practiced for approximately two to three weeks in preparation for recording a full-length album, even though Sub Pop had only requested an [[Extended play|EP]] to follow up the release.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 85<U+2013>89</ref> The main sessions for ''Bleach'' took place at Reciprocal Recording Studios in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], with local producer [[Jack Endino]]. Nirvana began recording with a five hour session on December 24, 1988.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 90</ref> The band recorded again on December 29<U+2013>31, and on January 14 and 24.<ref name="goldmine">Gaar, Gillian G. "Verse Chorus Verse: The Recording History of Nirvana". ''Goldmine''. 1997-02-14</ref> Endino billed the group for 30 hours of recording time.<ref name="Azerrad91"/> Three of the album's songs<U+2013>"Floyd the Barber", "Paper Cuts", and the CD-only track "Downer"<U+2013>were recorded during a previous session at Reciprocal Studios in 1988, featuring [[Dale Crover]] on drums. Despite attempts to re-record them with new drummer [[Chad Channing]], the band ultimately decided to remix the versions recorded with Crover for the final version of ''Bleach''.<ref name="Azerrad91">Azerrad, 1994. p. 91</ref> "Big Long Now" was omitted from the album because vocalist/guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] felt "there was already enough slow heavy stuff on ''Bleach'', and he 'didn't want that song to go out'", according to Endino.<ref name="goldmine" /> The album was edited and sequenced, but Sub Pop head [[Bruce Pavitt]] ordered that the album be completely re-sequenced. The record was further delayed for several months until Sub Pop was able to secure sufficient funds to issue it.<ref name="Azerrad91" />

Endino billed the band thirty hours of recording at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]606.17. [[Jason Everman]], a guitarist who was impressed by the band's demo with Dale Crover, supplied the money.  He briefly joined Nirvana as a second guitarist.<ref name="Azerrad91" /> Everman was credited as a guitarist on the album sleeve, and is the other guitarist on the cover of the album, even though he did not perform on the record. Bassist [[Krist Novoselic]] explained, "We just wanted to make him feel at home in the band."<ref name="azerrad 92">Azerrad, 1994. p. 92</ref>

==Music==
{{Listen|filename=Nirvana- About a Girl.ogg|title="About a Girl"|description="About a Girl" was written by Kurt Cobain for his then-girlfriend Tracy Marander. Writer Chuck Crisafulli said that it "perfectly captures the rage, hurt, and residual tenderness of a fractured, failing romance and packing it all into verses and choruses that are unstoppably catchy."<ref name="about a girl"/>

|filename2=Nirvana-LoveBuzz.ogg|title2="Love Buzz"|description2="Love Buzz" is a cover song by Nirvana originally written by [[Robbie van Leeuwen]] of the Dutch rock band [[Shocking Blue]]. The song is based on a seven-note bass [[riff]], with subdued guitars and repetitive choruses.<ref>True, 2007. p.99</ref>

|format=[[Ogg]]}}
According to Cobain, the music on ''Bleach'' conformed with the [[grunge]] genre Sub Pop heavily endorsed. "There was this pressure from Sub Pop and the grunge scene to play 'rock music'", Cobain said, and noted that he stripped it "down and make it sound like [[Aerosmith]]." Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the grunge sound in order to build a fanbase, and so he purposefully suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits when crafting the record.<ref name="Az 102">Azerrad, 1994. p. 102</ref> Krist Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by [[The Smithereens]] on one side and an album by the [[black metal]] band [[Celtic Frost]] on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well.<ref>Fricke, David. "Krist Novoselic". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. 2001-09-13</ref> The songs were described as "deliberately bleak, claustrophobic, and lyrically sparse, with none of the manic derangement or sense of release of the live performance."Cobain said that the song structures were "one<U+2013>dimensional", and said that he sought to present a more "polished and urbane side of happy."<ref name="sand 112">Sandford, 2004. p. 112</ref>  

[[Christopher Sandford]] described many of the compositions, saying: "'Paper Cuts' includes a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm of an early [[Led Zeppelin]] number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself on Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience." "School" was said by Sandford to be memorable for its chorus that "served as the rip."<ref name="sand 117">Sandford, 2004. pp. 116<U+2013>118</ref> The song is only four lines long. "Scoff" is "a parting salvo at [Cobain's parents]", and "Negative Creep" was written by Cobain about himself.<ref name="sand 117"/> According to Sandford, "About a Girl" has a "chiming melody and ironic chorus."<ref name="sand 117"/> In ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', Keith Cameron said the song "was exhilarating and it was exciting because that was the nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole thing could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last."<ref>Sandford, 2004. p. 135</ref> In Chuck Crisafulli's book ''Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song'', he wrote that the song "stands out in the Cobain canon as a song with a very specific genesis and a very real subject."<ref name="about a girl">Crisafulli, Chuck. ''Nirvana: The Stories Behind Every Song''. [[Da Capo Press]], 2006. ISBN 1560259477, p. 28<U+2013>36</ref>

Cobain told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that with ''Bleach'' he "didn't give a flying fuck what the lyrics were about", and claimed that 80 percent of the lyrics were written the night before recording.<ref name="smashing">Steinke, Darcey. "Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock". ''Spin''. October 1993.</ref>  He was often still working on the words on the drive to the recording studio.<ref name="Azerrad91" /> He explained: "It was like I'm pissed off. Don't know what about. Let's just scream negative lyrics, and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay. I don't hold any of those lyrics dear to me."<ref name="smashing" /> Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] noted that, nevertheless, many of the songs on the album reflected Cobain and various incidents in his life.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 97</ref> "Mr. Moustache" was inspired by Cobain's dislike of macho behavior,<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 99</ref> while "School" was a critique of the Seattle music scene, particularly Sub Pop.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 100</ref>

==Release and promotion==
The album cover was photographed by Cobain's then-girlfriend Tracy Marander during a concert at the Reko Muse art gallery in [[Olympia, Washington]].<ref name="cover">True, 2007. p. 125-6</ref> On February 25, 1989, Nirvana played at venues on the west coast, including the [[University of Washington]].<ref name="sand 78-79">Sandford, 2004. pp. 378<U+2013>379</ref> The group began its first European tour in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] on October 30 1989 and, on December 3 1989, the group performed a "triumphant" concert at the [[London Astoria]]. After the album's release, [[Kmart]] distributed a selection of clothing that promoted the band, as well as the [[grunge]] genre. Christopher Sandford related: "when the style pundits noted Cobain's 'patent lumberjack shirts and ugly fifties geometric-patterned jerseys', seeing an example of 'low-couture chic' they missed the point that flannel shirts and sweaters were everyday dress in the marine climate of the Northwest."<ref name="sand 112"/> Cobain took note and said that he never intended to start a [[fad]] or act as a role model.<ref name="sand 112"/> On April 1, 1990, the band launched its second major U.S. tour. During the tour, [[Chad Channing]] was replaced by [[Dale Crover]].<ref name="sand 78-79"/>

The album's working title was ''Too Many Humans''.<ref>Cross, p. 105</ref> It was renamed ''Bleach'' after Cobain found an [[AIDS]] prevention poster while Nirvana was driving through [[San Francisco]]. The poster advised [[heroin]] addicts to bleach their needles before use, featuring the slogan "Bleach Your Works".<ref name="Azerrad91" /> In Australia, ''Bleach'' was released on [[Waterfront Records]] and re-issued on various colored covers and colored vinyl prior to 1992.<ref>Berkenstadt, Cross, 2003. p. 147</ref>

In April 1992, following the success of Nirvana's second album ''[[Nevermind]]'', Sub Pop released a remastered version of ''Bleach'' on LP, CD and cassette. [[Geffen Records]] handled the international release.<ref>Berkenstadt, Cross, 2003. p. 148</ref> The CD version was packaged in a cardboard foldout case that included a bonus booklet filled with photos of the band from 1987<U+2013>1990.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 95</ref> For the 20th anniversary of the album, Sub Pop released on November 3, 2009 a deluxe reissue of ''Bleach'' featuring a March 2009 remastering from the original tapes by George Marino and a live recording of a 1990 show at [[Portland, Oregon]]'s Pine Street Theatre.<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web |last=Breihan |first=Tom |date=2008-08-14 |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/36229-sub-pop-to-reissue-nirvanas-ibleachi/ |title=Sub Pop to Reissue Nirvana's Bleach |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |accessdate=2008-08-14}}</ref>

The album has generally received positive reviews by professionals. Anthony Carew from the About.com Guide said that the album "define[d] the entire decade of the '90s", and awarded it four out of five stars.<ref name="about"/> [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] gave the album three and a half out of five stars, noting that "Kurt Cobain illustrated signs of his considerable songcraft, particularly on the minor-key ballad 'About a Girl' and the dense churn of 'Blew'". He also said that "it's a debut from a band that shows potential but haven't yet achieved it."<ref name="allmusic review"/> ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Edwin Pouncey said that the album was the "biggest, baddest sound that Sub Pop have so far managed to unearth. So primitive that they manage to make label mates Mudhoney sound like Genesis, Nirvana turn up the volume and spit and claw their way to the top of the musical garbage heap", and gave it an eight out of ten rating.<ref name="NME">Pouncey, Edwin [http://www.nme.com/reviews/nirvana/7370 "-Nirvana: Bleach (Sub Pop import US LP only)"].
