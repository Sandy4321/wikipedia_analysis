'''Charles Robert Darwin''' [[Royal Society|FRS]] (12 February 1809 <U+2013> 19 April 1882) was an [[English people|English]] [[natural history|naturalist]]{{Ref_label|A|I|none}} who established that all [[species]] of life have descended over time from [[common descent|common ancestors]], and proposed the [[scientific theory]] that this [[Phylogenetics|branching pattern]] of [[evolution]] resulted from a process that he called [[natural selection]]. He published his theory with compelling evidence for evolution in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last = Coyne |first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= Oxford |isbn=0-199-23084-6 |page=17 |quote=In ''The Origin'', Darwin provided an alternative hypothesis for the development , diversification, and design of life.

Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his [[medical education]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]; instead, he helped to investigate [[marine invertebrates]]. Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] encouraged his passion for [[natural science]].<ref name=whowas>{{Harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/WhoWas.html About Charles Darwin]}}</ref> His [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|five-year voyage]] on {{HMS|Beagle}} established him as an eminent [[geology|geologist]] whose observations and theories supported [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian]] ideas, and publication of his [[The Voyage of the Beagle|journal of the voyage]] made him famous as a popular author.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 210, 284<U+2013>285}}</ref>

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and [[fossil]]s he collected on the voyage, Darwin investigated the [[transmutation of species]] and conceived his theory of natural selection in 1838.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=263<U+2013>274}}</ref> Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.<ref>{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=184, 187}}</ref> He was writing up his theory in 1858 when [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] sent him an essay which described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|both of their theories]].<ref>{{cite doi|10.1007/BF00351923}}</ref> Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature.<ref name = JvW/> In 1871, he examined [[human evolution]] and [[sexual selection]] in ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'', followed by ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''. His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, he examined [[earthworm]]s and their effect on soil.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freeman|1977}}</ref>

In recognition of Darwin's pre-eminence as a scientist, he was one of only five nineteenth-century non-royal personages from the United Kingdom to be honoured by a [[state funeral]],<ref name=BBCstatefuneral>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7538482.stm |title=BBC NEWS : Politics : Thatcher state funeral undecided|date=2008-08-02|accessdate=2008-08-10 | work=BBC News}}</ref> and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], close to [[John Herschel]] and [[Isaac Newton]].<ref name=DarwinsBurial>{{Harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/burial.html Darwin's Burial]}}</ref>

===Childhood and education===

He has straight mid brown hair, and wears dark clothes with a large frilly white collar. In his lap he holds a pot of flowering plants|The seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816.]]

Charles Robert Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], [[Shropshire]], England on 12 February 1809 at his family home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|the Mount]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/|title=The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin)|author=John H. Wahlert|date=11 June 2001|work=Darwin and Darwinism|publisher=[[Baruch College]]|accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref> He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier [[Robert Darwin]], and [[Susannah Darwin]] (''n<U+00E9>e'' Wedgwood). He was the grandson of [[Erasmus Darwin]] on his father's side, and of [[Josiah Wedgwood]] on his mother's side. Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a [[Freethought#England and France|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in the Anglican Church, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight year old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] attending the nearby Anglican [[Shrewsbury School]] as a [[boarding school|boarder]].<ref name=skool>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 12<U+2013>15}}<br />{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=21 21<U+2013>25]}}</ref>

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. He found lectures dull and [[surgery]] distressing, so neglected his studies. He learned [[taxidermy]] from [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave who had accompanied [[Charles Waterton]] in the [[South America]]n [[rainforest]], and often sat with this "very pleasant and intelligent man".<ref name=eddy>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=48 47<U+2013>51]}}</ref>

In Darwin's second year he joined the [[Plinian Society]], a student [[natural history]] group whose debates strayed into [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] [[materialism]]. He assisted [[Robert Edmund Grant]]'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of [[marine invertebrates]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], and on 27th March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]]. One day, Grant praised [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck's]] [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished, but had recently read the similar ideas of his grandfather Erasmus and remained indifferent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72<U+2013>88}}</ref> Darwin was rather bored by [[Robert Jameson]]'s natural history course which covered [[geology]] including the debate between [[Neptunism]] and [[Plutonism]]. He learned [[alpha taxonomy|classification]] of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the [[Royal Museum|University Museum]], one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=42<U+2013>43}}</ref>

This neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican [[parson]]. As Darwin was unqualified for the ''[[Tripos]]'', he joined the ''ordinary'' degree course in January 1828.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47<U+2013>48, 89<U+2013>91}}</ref> He preferred [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[shooting sports|shooting]] to studying. His cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] introduced him to the popular craze for [[beetle]] collecting which Darwin pursued zealously, getting some of his finds published in [[James Francis Stephens|Stevens']] ''Illustrations of British entomology''. He became a close friend and follower of botany professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] and met other leading naturalists who saw scientific work as religious [[natural theology]], becoming known to these [[University don|dons]] as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin focused on his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity''.<ref name=dar57>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=59 57<U+2013>67]}}</ref> In his final examination in January 1831 Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ''ordinary'' degree.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=97}}</ref>

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June. He studied Paley's ''[[Natural Theology (Paley)|Natural Theology]]'' which made an [[teleological argument|argument for divine design in nature]], explaining [[adaptation]] as God acting through laws of nature.<ref name=syd5-7>{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5<U+2013>7}}</ref> He read [[John Herschel]]'s new book which described the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] as understanding such laws through [[inductive reasoning]] based on observation, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'' of scientific travels. Inspired with "a burning zeal" to contribute, Darwin planned to visit [[Tenerife]] with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the [[tropics]]. In preparation, he joined [[Adam Sedgwick]]'s geology course, then went with him in the summer for a fortnight to map strata in [[Wales]].<ref name=db>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=69 67<U+2013>68]}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=128<U+2013>129, 133<U+2013>141}}</ref> After a week with student friends at [[Barmouth]], he returned home to find a letter from Henslow proposing Darwin as a suitable (if unfinished) gentleman naturalist for a self-funded place with captain [[Robert FitzRoy]], more as a companion than a mere collector, on {{HMS|Beagle}} which was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-105.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 105 <U+2014> Henslow, J. S. to Darwin, C. R., 24 Aug 1831|accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref> His father objected to the planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah Wedgwood]], to agree to his son's participation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 94<U+2013>97}}</ref>

===Voyage of the ''Beagle''===
{{details|Second voyage of HMS Beagle}}
[[Image:Voyage of the Beagle-en.svg|thumb|400px|alt=Route from Plymouth, England, south to Cape Verde then southwest across the Atlantic to Bahia, Brazil, south to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, the Falkland Islands, round the tip of South America then north to Valparaiso and Callao.

Northwest to the Keeling Islands, southwest to Mauritius and Cape Town, then northwest to Bahia and northeast back to Plymouth.|The voyage of the ''Beagle'']]
Beginning on the 27th of December, 1831, the voyage lasted almost five years and, as FitzRoy had intended, Darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while the ''Beagle'' [[hydrography|surveyed and charted]] coasts.<ref name=JvW/><ref name=kix>{{harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1840&pageseq=12 ix<U+2013>xi]}}</ref> He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|his journal]] for his family.<ref>{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|pp=18<U+2013>21}}</ref> He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting [[marine invertebrates]], but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal.<ref name=fnGal>{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_Keynes_Galapagos.html|title=Darwin's field notes on the Galapagos: 'A little world within itself'|author=Gordon Chancellor|coauthors=[[Randal Keynes]]|month=October| year=2006|publisher=[[Darwin Online]]|accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref> Despite repeatedly suffering badly from seasickness while at sea, most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with [[plankton]] collected in a calm spell.<ref name=kix/><ref name=plankton>{{Harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1925&viewtype=text&pageseq=53 21-22]}}</ref>

On their first stop ashore at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|St. Jago]], Darwin found that a white band high in the [[volcanic rock]] cliffs included seashells. FitzRoy had given him the first volume of [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'' which set out [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian]] concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods,{{Ref_label|B|II|none}} and Darwin saw things Lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=183<U+2013>190}}</ref>
In [[Brazil]], Darwin was delighted by the [[Bahia coastal forests|tropical forest]],<ref>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=73 41<U+2013>42]}}</ref> but detested the sight of [[slavery]].<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=75 73<U+2013>74]}}</ref>

At [[Punta Alta]] in [[Patagonia]] he made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct [[mammal]]s in cliffs beside modern seashells, indicating recent [[extinction]] with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little known ''[[Megatherium]]'' by a tooth and its association with bony armour which had at first seemed to him like a giant version of the armour on local [[armadillo]]s. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 223<U+2013>235}}<br>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1&viewtype=text&pageseq=7 7]}}<br>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 210}}</ref><ref name=k206>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=138 206<U+2013>209]}}</ref> On rides with [[gaucho]]s into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils he gained social, political and [[anthropology|anthropological]] insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of [[rhea (bird)|rhea]] had separate but overlapping territories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 189<U+2013>192, 198}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}</ref> Further south he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as [[raised beach]]es showing a series of elevations. He read Lyell's second volume and accepted its view of "centres of creation" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged Lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 131, 159}}<br />{{harvnb|Herbert|1991|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A342&pageseq=16 174<U+2013>179]}}</ref><ref name=HurrahChiloe>{{cite web|url= http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.8.html|title=Darwin Online: 'Hurrah Chiloe': an introduction to the Port Desire Notebook|accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref>

Three Fuegians on board, who had been seized during the [[HMS Beagle#First voyage|first ''Beagle'' voyage]] and had spent a year in England, were taken back to [[Tierra del Fuego]] as missionaries. Darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet their relatives seemed "miserable, degraded savages", as different as wild from domesticated animals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1845|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&viewtype=text&pageseq=218 205<U+2013>208]}}</ref> To Darwin the difference showed cultural advances, not racial inferiority. Unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp= 244<U+2013>250}}</ref> A year on, the mission had been abandoned. The Fuegian they had named [[Jemmy Button]] lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to England.<ref>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=258 226<U+2013>227]}}</ref>

Darwin experienced an earthquake in [[Chile]] and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including [[mussel]]-beds stranded above high tide. High in the [[Andes]] he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. He theorised that as the land rose, [[island|oceanic islands]] sank, and [[coral reef]]s round them grew to form [[atoll]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 160<U+2013>168, 182}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|p= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1452.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=278 260]}}</ref><ref name=atolls>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&viewtype=text&pageseq=100 p 98<U+2013>99]}}</ref>

On the geologically new [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]] Darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older "centre of creation", and found [[mockingbird]]s allied to those in Chile but differing from island to island. He heard that slight variations in the shape of [[tortoise]] shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food.<ref name=k356>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=388 356<U+2013>357]}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sulloway|1982|p=19}}</ref> In Australia, the [[marsupial]] [[Potoridae|rat-kangaroo]] and the [[platypus]] seemed so unusual that Darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work.<ref name=Crows>{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.3.html|title=Darwin Online: Coccatoos & Crows: An introduction to the Sydney Notebook|accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref> He found the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] "good-humoured & pleasant", and noted their depletion by European settlement.<ref>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=430 398<U+2013>399].}}</ref>

The ''Beagle'' investigated how the atolls of the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] had formed, and the survey supported Darwin's theorising.<ref name=atolls/> FitzRoy began writing the official ''Narrative'' of the ''Beagle'' voyages, and after reading Darwin's diary he proposed incorporating it into the account.<ref name=Letter301>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-301.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 301 <U+2014> Darwin, C.R. to Darwin, C.S., 29 Apr 1836}}</ref> Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal]]'' was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on natural history.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p= 336}}</ref>

In [[Cape Town]] Darwin and FitzRoy met [[John Herschel]], who had recently written to Lyell praising his [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] as opening bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" as "a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".<ref name=Rascals>{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A544&pageseq=21 197]}}</ref>
When organising his notes as the ship sailed home, Darwin wrote that if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the [[Falkland Islands Wolf|Falkland Islands Fox]] were correct, "such facts undermine the stability of Species", then cautiously added "would" before "undermine".<ref name=xix>{{Harvnb|Keynes|2000|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1840&pageseq=22 xix<U+2013>xx]}}<br />{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}</ref> He later wrote that such facts "seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species".<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=16 p. 1]}}</ref>

On the final leg of his journey home aboard HMS Beagle, he called in at [[Ascension Island| Ascension]] after visiting St Helena. The visit would eventually lead to the creation of an artificial cloud forest.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11137903 Creation of an artificial cloud forest]</ref>

===Inception of Darwin's evolutionary theory===
{{details|Inception of Darwin's theory}}

When the ''Beagle'' reached [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], on 2 October 1836, Darwin was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in December 1835 [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1835|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Freeman_LettersOnGeology.html editorial introduction]}}</ref> Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to [[Cambridge]] to see Henslow, who advised on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed to take on the botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded [[gentleman]] scientist, and an excited Darwin went round the [[London]] institutions being f<U+00EA>ted and seeking experts to describe the collections. Zoologists had a huge backlog of work, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 195<U+2013>198}}</ref>

[[Charles Lyell]] eagerly met Darwin for the first time on 29 October and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist [[Richard Owen]], who had the facilities of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct [[ground sloth]]s as well as the ''[[Megatherium]]'', a near complete skeleton of the unknown ''[[Scelidotherium]]'' and a [[hippopotamus]]-sized [[rodent]]-like skull named ''[[Toxodon]]'' resembling a giant [[capybara]]. The armour fragments were actually from ''[[Glyptodon]]'', a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought.<ref>{{Harvnb|Owen|1840|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F9.1&pageseq=26 16], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F9.1&pageseq=83 73], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F9.1&pageseq=116 106]}}<br>{{Harvnb|Eldredge|2006}}</ref><ref name=k206/> These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 201<U+2013>205}}<br>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=349<U+2013>350}}</ref>

In mid-December Darwin took lodgings in Cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his ''Journal''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=345<U+2013>347}}</ref> He wrote his first paper, showing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and with Lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the [[Geological Society of London]] on 4 January 1837. On the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]]. The ornithologist [[John Gould]] soon announced that the Galapagos birds that Darwin had thought a mixture of [[Icterid|blackbirds]], "[[Grosbeak|gros-beaks]]" and [[finch]]es, were, in fact, twelve [[Darwin's finches|separate species of finches]]. On 17 February Darwin was elected to the Council of the Geological Society, and Lyell's presidential address presented Owen's findings on Darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarian]] ideas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 207<U+2013>210}}<br />{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=20<U+2013>23}}</ref>

Early in March, Darwin moved to London to be near this work, joining Lyell's social circle of scientists and [[expert]]s such as [[Charles Babbage]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-346.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 346 <U+2014> Darwin, C.

[[John Herschel]]'s letter on the "mystery of mysteries" of new species was widely discussed, with explanations sought in [[physical law|laws of nature]], not [[ad hoc]] miracles. Darwin stayed with his [[freethought|freethinking]] brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]], part of this [[British Whig Party|Whig]] circle and close friend of writer [[Harriet Martineau]] who promoted [[Malthusianism]] underlying the controversial Whig [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law reforms]] to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. As a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] she welcomed the [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] implications of [[transmutation of species]], promoted by [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]] and younger surgeons influenced by [[<U+00C9>tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy]], but anathema to Anglicans defending social order.<ref name=Rascals/><ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=201, 212<U+2013>221}}</ref>

Gould met Darwin and told him that the Gal<U+00E1>pagos [[mockingbird]]s from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what Darwin had thought was a "[[wren]]" was also [[Warbler Finch|in the finch group]]. Darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ''Beagle'', including FitzRoy, he allocated species to islands.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=9, 20<U+2013>23}}</ref> The two [[rhea (bird)|rheas]] were also distinct species, and on 14 March Darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=360}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1643&viewtype=text&pageseq=1|title=Darwin, C.

By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his ''Red Notebook'' on the possibility that "one species does change into another" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange ''[[Macrauchenia]]'' which resembled a giant [[guanaco]]. His thoughts on lifespan, [[asexual reproduction]] and [[sexual reproduction]] developed in his "B" notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring "to adapt & alter the race to ''changing'' world" explaining the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos tortoise]]s, mockingbirds and rheas.

===Overwork, illness, and marriage===
{{Seealso|Charles Darwin's health}}
While developing this intensive study of [[transmutation of species|transmutation]], Darwin became mired in more work. Still rewriting his ''Journal'', he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with Henslow's help obtained a Treasury grant of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]'', a sum equivalent to about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|1000|1837|r=-3}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-2}}.{{inflation-fn|UK}} He stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed unrealistic dates with the publisher.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=367<U+2013>369}}</ref> As the [[Victorian era]] began, Darwin pressed on with writing his ''Journal'', and in August 1837 began correcting [[Galley proof|printer's proofs]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keynes|2001|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1925&pageseq=21 xix]}}</ref>

Darwin's health suffered from the pressure. On 20 September he had "an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart", so his doctors urged him to "knock off all work" and live in the country for a few weeks. After visiting Shrewsbury he joined his Wedgwood relatives at [[Maer Hall]], [[Staffordshire]], but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. His charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin [[Emma Darwin|Emma Wedgwood]], nine months older than Darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. His uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Jos]] pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under [[loam]] and suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, inspiring "a new & important theory" on their role in [[pedogenesis|soil formation]] which Darwin presented at the Geological Society on 1 November.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233<U+2013>234}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 404 <U+2014> Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838|accessdate=2008-12-23}}</ref>

[[William Whewell]] pushed Darwin to take on the duties of Secretary of the Geological Society. After initially declining the work, he accepted the post in March 1838.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 233<U+2013>236}}.</ref> Despite the grind of writing and editing the ''Beagle'' reports, Darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience such as farmers and [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fanciers]].<ref name=JvW/><ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241<U+2013>244, 426}}</ref> Over time his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=xii}}</ref> He included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an [[orangutan]] in the zoo on 28 March 1838 noted its child-like behaviour.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 241<U+2013>244}}</ref>

The strain took a toll, and by June he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. For the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe [[boil]]s, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress such as attending meetings or making social visits. The cause of [[Charles Darwin's illness|Darwin's illness]] remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had little success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 252, 476, 531}}<br />{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=119 115]}}</ref>

On 23 June he took a break and went "geologising" in Scotland. He visited [[Glen Roy]] in glorious weather to see the parallel "roads" cut into the hillsides at three heights. He later published his view that these were marine [[raised beach]]es, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a [[proglacial lake]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 254}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=377<U+2013>378}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=86 84]}}</ref>

Fully recuperated, he returned to Shrewsbury in July. Used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed ''"Marry"'' and ''"Not Marry"''. Advantages included "constant companion and a friend in old age&nbsp;... better than a dog anyhow", against points such as "less money for books" and "terrible loss of time."<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&viewtype=text&pageseq=238 232<U+2013>233]}}</ref> Having decided in favour, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit Emma on 29 July. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=256<U+2013>259}}</ref>

Continuing his research in London, Darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]''
{{Quotation|In October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement Malthus on Population, and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed.

Malthus asserted that unless human population is kept in check, it increases in a [[geometrical progression]] and soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a [[Malthusian catastrophe]].<ref name="JvW"/> Darwin was well prepared to see at once that this also applied to [[A. P. de Candolle|de Candolle's]] "warring of the species" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. As species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost.

On 11 November, he returned to Maer and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas.

===Preparing the theory of natural selection for publication===
{{details|Development of Darwin's theory}}

Darwin now had the framework of his theory of [[natural selection]] "by which to work",<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=124 120]}}</ref> as his "prime hobby".<ref name=Letter419>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-419.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 419 <U+2014> Darwin, C.

When FitzRoy's ''Narrative'' was published in May 1839, Darwin's ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle|Journal and Remarks]]'' was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1887|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=39003&pageno=32 p. 32.]}}</ref> Early in 1842, Darwin wrote about his ideas to [[Charles Lyell]], who noted that his ally "denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species".<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=292}}</ref>

Darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. He now renewed a fascination and expertise in [[marine invertebrates]], dating back to his student days with [[Robert Edmond Grant|Grant]], by dissecting and classifying the [[barnacle]]s he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures.<ref>{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=190<U+2013>191}}</ref> In 1847, Hooker read the "Essay" and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned Darwin's opposition to continuing acts of [[creation myth|creation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 320<U+2013>323, 339<U+2013>348}}</ref>

In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. [[James Manby Gully|James Gully]]'s [[Great Malvern|Malvern]] spa and was surprised to find some benefit from [[hydrotherapy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-1236.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 1236 <U+2014> Darwin, C.

In eight years of work on barnacles (Cirripedia), Darwin's theory helped him to find "[[homology (biology)|homologies]]" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some [[genus|genera]] he found minute males [[parasitism|parasitic]] on [[hermaphrodite]]s, showing an [[Androdioecy|intermediate stage]] in evolution of [[Gonochorism|distinct sexes]].<ref name=barlowbio117>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1954|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=121 117<U+2013>118]}}</ref> In 1853 it earned him the [[Royal Society]]'s Royal Medal, and it made his reputation as a [[biology|biologist]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 383<U+2013>387}}</ref> He resumed work on his theory of species in 1854, and in November realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to "diversified places in the economy of nature".<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 419<U+2013>420}}</ref>

===Publication of the theory of natural selection===
{{details|Publication of Darwin's theory}}
[[Image:Charles Darwin.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Head and shoulders portrait of a balding Darwin looking rather grim and slightly startled.|Darwin was forced into swift publication of his theory of [[natural selection]].]]

By the start of 1856, Darwin was investigating whether eggs and [[seed]]s could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] was firmly against evolution. [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] was intrigued by Darwin's speculations without realising their extent. When he read a paper by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] on the ''Introduction'' of species, he saw similarities with Darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. Though Darwin saw no threat, he began work on a short paper. Finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a "big book on species" titled ''Natural Selection''. He continued his researches, [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|obtaining information]] and specimens from naturalists worldwide including Wallace who was working in [[Borneo]]. The American botanist [[Asa Gray]] showed similar interests, and on 5 September 1857 Darwin sent Gray a detailed outline of his ideas including an abstract of ''Natural Selection''. In December, Darwin received a letter from Wallace asking if the book would examine [[human evolution|human origins]]. He responded that he would avoid that subject, "so surrounded with prejudices", while encouraging Wallace's theorising and adding that "I go much further than you."<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 412<U+2013>441, 457<U+2013>458, 462<U+2013>463}}</ref>

Darwin's book was half way when, on 18 June 1858, he received a paper from Wallace describing natural selection. Shocked that he had been "forestalled", Darwin sent it on to Lyell, as requested, and, though Wallace had not asked for publication, he suggested he would send it to any journal that Wallace chose. His family was in crisis with children in the village dying of [[scarlet fever]], and he put matters in the hands of Lyell and Hooker. They decided on a joint presentation at the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]] on 1 July of ''[[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection]]''; however, Darwin's baby son died of the scarlet fever and he was too distraught to attend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 466<U+2013>470}}</ref>

There was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the Linnean Society remarked in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=40<U+2013>42, 48<U+2013>49}}</ref> Only one review rankled enough for Darwin to recall it later; Professor [[Samuel Haughton]] of Dublin claimed that "all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old."<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&viewtype=text&pageseq=126 122]}}</ref> Darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his "big book", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends.

''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 November 1859.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 477}}</ref> In the book, Darwin set out "one long argument" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=477 p 459]}}</ref> His only allusion to human evolution was the understatement that "light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history".<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=506 p 490]}}</ref> His theory is simply stated in the introduction:
{{quotation|As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be ''naturally selected''. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=20 p 5]}}</ref>}}

He put a strong case for [[common descent]], but avoided the then controversial term "[[evolutionism|evolution]]", and at the end of the book concluded that:
{{quotation|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&viewtype=text&pageseq=508 p 492]}}</ref>}}

The book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular ''[[Vestiges of Creation]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2008b|p=48}}</ref> Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and [[Correspondence of Charles Darwin|corresponded on it]] with colleagues worldwide.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=103<U+2013>104, 379}}</ref> Darwin had only said "Light will be thrown on the origin of man",<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=506 488]}}</ref> but the first review claimed it made a creed of the "men from monkeys" idea from ''Vestiges''.<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|2002|p=87}}<br />{{harvnb|Leifchild|1859}}</ref> Amongst early favourable responses, Huxley's reviews swiped at [[Richard Owen]], leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=477<U+2013>491}}</ref> In April, Owen's review attacked Darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering Darwin,<ref>{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=110<U+2013>112}}</ref> but Owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=186}}</ref>

The [[Church of England]]'s response was mixed. Darwin's old Cambridge tutors [[Adam Sedgwick|Sedgwick]] and [[John Stevens Henslow|Henslow]] dismissed the ideas, but [[liberal Christianity|liberal clergymen]] interpreted natural selection as an instrument of God's design, with the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] seeing it as "just as noble a conception of Deity".<ref name=Darwinanddesign>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/content/view/110/104/|title=Darwin and design: historical essay|year=2007|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> In 1860, the publication of ''[[Essays and Reviews]]'' by seven liberal Anglican theologians diverted [[clergy|clerical]] attention from Darwin, with its ideas including [[higher criticism]] attacked by church authorities as [[heresy]]. In it, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that [[miracle]]s broke God's laws, so belief in them was [[atheism|atheistic]], and praised "Mr Darwin's masterly volume &#91;supporting&#93; the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature".<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp= 487<U+2013>488, 500}}</ref> [[Asa Gray]] discussed [[teleology]] with Darwin, who imported and distributed Gray's pamphlet on [[theistic evolution]], ''Natural Selection is not inconsistent with [[natural theology|Natural Theology]]''.<ref name=Darwinanddesign/><ref name=miles>{{Harvnb|Miles|2001}}</ref> The most famous confrontation was at the public [[1860 Oxford evolution debate]] during a meeting of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]], where the [[Bishop of Oxford]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]], though not opposed to [[transmutation of species]], argued against Darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]] argued strongly for Darwin, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]]'s legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.<ref name=Darwinanddesign/><ref>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=185}}</ref>

Even Darwin's close friends Gray, Hooker, Huxley and Lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. Gray and Lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while Huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. He campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education,<ref name=Darwinanddesign/> aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under Owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. Owen's claim that [[brain]] anatomy proved humans to be a separate [[order (biology)|biological order]] from apes was shown to be false by Huxley in a long running dispute parodied by Kingsley as the "[[Great Hippocampus Question]]", and discredited Owen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=156<U+2013>159}}</ref>

[[Darwinism]] became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. In 1863 [[Charles Lyell|Lyell's]] ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed Darwin. Weeks later Huxley's ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then ''[[The Naturalist on the River Amazons]]'' by [[Henry Walter Bates]] provided empirical evidence of natural selection.<ref name=B217>{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=217<U+2013>226}}</ref> Lobbying brought Darwin Britain's highest scientific honour, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Copley Medal]], awarded on 3 November 1864.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-4652.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Letter 4652 <U+2014> Falconer, Hugh to Darwin, C.

The ''Origin of Species'' was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the "working men" who flocked to Huxley's lectures.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=507<U+2013>508}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=128<U+2013>129, 138}}</ref> Darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time{{Ref_label|C|III|none}} and became a key fixture of [[popular culture]].{{Ref_label|D|IV|none}} Cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in Britain these droll images served to popularise Darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. While ill in 1862 Darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 caricatures of him as an [[ape]] helped to identify all forms of [[evolutionism]] with Darwinism.<ref name=b373>{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=373<U+2013>379}}</ref>

Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, Darwin's work continued. Having published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' as an [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his "big book". He covered [[human evolution|human descent]] from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

Enquiries about insect [[pollination]] led in 1861 to novel studies of wild [[orchid]]s, showing adaptation of their flowers to [[Pollination syndrome|attract specific moths]] to each species and ensure [[heterosis|cross fertilisation]]. In 1862 ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex [[ecology|ecological]] relationships, making testable predictions.

''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' of 1868 was the first part of Darwin's planned "big book", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of [[pangenesis]] attempting to explain [[heredity]]. It sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. He wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freeman|1977|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=A1&pageseq=123 122]}}</ref>

[[Charles Lyell|Lyell]] had already popularised human prehistory, and [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Huxley]] had shown that anatomically humans are apes.<ref name=B217/> With ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' published in 1871, Darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented [[sexual selection]] to explain impractical animal features such as the [[peacock]]'s plumage as well as human evolution of [[culture]], differences between sexes, and physical and cultural [[race (classification of human beings)|racial characteristics]], while emphasising that humans are all one species.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.2&pageseq=402 385<U+2013>405]}}<br />{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=339<U+2013>343}}</ref> His research using images was expanded in his 1872 book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the [[evolutionary psychology|evolution of human psychology]] and its continuity with the [[ethology|behaviour of animals]]. Both books proved very popular, and Darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that "everybody is talking about it without being shocked."<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=359<U+2013>369}}<br />{{harvnb|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1452.3&pageseq=145 133]}}</ref> His conclusion was "that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system<U+2013>with all these exalted powers<U+2013>Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=422 405]}}</ref>

His evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on ''[[Insectivorous Plants (book)|Insectivorous Plants]], [[The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom]]'', different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]''. In his last book he returned to ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]''.

He died at [[Down House]] on 19 April 1882. He had expected to be buried in St Mary's churchyard at [[Downe]], but at the request of Darwin's colleagues, [[William Spottiswoode]] (President of the [[Royal Society]]) arranged for Darwin to be given a [[state funeral]] and buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], close to [[John Herschel]] and [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=495<U+2013>497}}</ref> Only five non-royal personages were granted that honour of a UK state funeral during the 19th century.<ref name=BBCstatefuneral/>

Darwin was perceived as a national hero who had changed thinking, and scientists now accepted [[evolution]] as [[common descent|descent with modification]], but few agreed with him that "natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification".<ref name=b222>{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=222<U+2013>225}}<br>{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}<br>{{harvnb|Darwin|1872|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F391&pageseq=449 421]}}</ref> In "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]" most favoured alternative evolutionary mechanisms, but these proved untenable, and the development of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]] with [[population genetics]] and [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]] from the 1930s to the 1950s brought a broad scientific consensus that [[natural selection]] was the basic mechanism of evolution.

==Religious views==
{{Details|Charles Darwin's religious views}}
Darwin's family tradition was [[nonconformism|nonconformist]] [[Unitarianism]], while his father and grandfather were [[freethought|freethinkers]], and his [[baptism]] and [[boarding school]] were [[Church of England]].<ref name=skool/> When going to Cambridge to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman, he did not doubt the [[Biblical inerrancy|literal truth]] of the [[Bible]].<ref name=dar57/> He learnt [[John Herschel]]'s science which, like [[William Paley]]'s [[natural theology]], sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw [[adaptation]] of species as [[teleological argument|evidence of design]].<ref name=syd5-7/><ref name=db/> On board the ''Beagle'', Darwin was quite [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and would quote the Bible as an authority on [[morality]].<ref name=biorelig>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F1497&viewtype=side&pageseq=87 85<U+2013>96]}}</ref> He looked for "centres of creation" to explain distribution,<ref name=k356/> and related the [[antlion]] found near [[kangaroo]]s to distinct "periods of Creation".<ref name=Crows/>

By his return he was [[Higher criticism|critical of the Bible as history]], and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid.<ref name=biorelig/> In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and [[transmutation of species]], he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with [[Emma Darwin|Emma]], whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning.<ref name=Belief/> The [[theodicy]] of Paley and [[Thomas Malthus]] vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, [[natural selection]] produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design,<ref>{{harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=8<U+2013>14}}</ref> and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering such as the [[ichneumon wasp]] paralysing [[caterpillar]]s as live food for its eggs.<ref name=miles/> He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' reflects theological views.

Darwin remained close friends with the [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of Downe, [[John Brodie-Innes|John Innes]], and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-the-church-article |title=Darwin Correspondence Project - Darwin and the church: historical essay|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref> but from around 1849 would go for a walk on Sundays while his family attended church.<ref name=jvw41/> He considered it "absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"<ref name=Fordyce>[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-12041.html Letter 12041] <U+2014> Darwin, C.

==Political interpretations==
Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements which at times had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

[[File:VanityFair-Darwin2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Full length portrait of a very thin white bearded Darwin, seated but leaning eagerly forward and smiling.|Caricature from 1871 ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'']]

===Eugenics===
{{details|Eugenics}}
Darwin was interested by his [[Cousin#Mathematical definitions|half-cousin]] [[Francis Galton]]'s argument, introduced in 1865, that [[Historiometry|statistical analysis]] of [[heredity]] showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of [[natural selection]], but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a "caste" of "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it "the sole feasible, yet I fear [[utopian]], plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=556<U+2013>557, 572, 598}}<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=180 167<U+2013>173], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.2&pageseq=419 402<U+2013>403]}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.galton.org/letters/darwin/correspondence.htm|title=Corespondence between Francis Galton and Charles Darwin|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref>

Galton named the field of study "[[eugenics]]" in 1883, after Darwin's death, and developed [[biometrics]]. Eugenics movements were widespread at a time when Darwin's [[The eclipse of Darwin|natural selection was eclipsed]] by [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]] [[genetics]], and in some countries [[compulsory sterilization|compulsory sterilisation]] laws were imposed, the most famous of which were in [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi Germany]]. It has been largely abandoned throughout the world.{{Ref_label|E|V|none}}

===Social Darwinism===
{{details|Social Darwinism}}
Taking descriptive ideas as moral and social justification creates the ethical [[is-ought problem]]. When [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that [[Malthusian catastrophe|population growth beyond resources]] was ordained by God to get humans to [[Protestant work ethic|work productively]] and show restraint in getting families, this was used in the 1830s to justify [[workhouse]]s and [[laissez-faire economics]].<ref name=wm>{{harvnb|Wilkins|1997}}<br />{{Harvnb|Moore|2006}}</ref> Evolution was seen as having social implications, and [[Herbert Spencer]]'s 1851 book ''Social Statics'' based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolutionary theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sweet|2004}}</ref>

Darwin's theory of evolution was a matter of explanation. He thought it "absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another" and saw evolution as having no goal, but soon after the ''Origin'' was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a [[Malthusianism|Malthusian]] justification for the English industrial [[capitalism]] of the time. The term ''[[Darwinism]]'' was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including Spencer's "[[survival of the fittest]]" as free-market progress, and [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s [[racism|racist]] ideas of [[Ernst Haeckel#Polygenism and racial theory|human development]]. Darwin did not share the racism common at that time: a point examined by the philosopher [[Antony Flew]], who is at pains to distance Darwin's attitudes from those later attributed to him.<ref>{{cite book|last=Flew|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Flew|title=Darwinian Evolution|publisher=Transaction|location=Piscataway, NJ|year=1997|edition=2|isbn=1-56000-948-9|quote=...there seem to be absolutely no grounds for pillorying Darwin as a racist.

Darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. He thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] in ''[[The Sexes Throughout Nature]]''.<ref name=Vandermassen>{{cite journal|author=Vandermassen, Griet|title=Sexual Selection: A Tale of Male Bias and Feminist Denial|url=http://ejw.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/11/1/9|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|year=2004|volume=11|issue=9|doi=10.1177/1350506804039812|accessdate=2009-11-24|pages=11<U+2013>13|ref=harv}}</ref> He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect of extermination of savage peoples who did not become civilised.

The term "[[Social Darwinism]]" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by [[Richard Hofstadter]] to attack the laissez-faire [[conservatism]] of those like [[William Graham Sumner]] who opposed reform and socialism. Since then it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paul|2003}}<br />{{Harvnb|Kotzin|2004}}</ref><ref name=wm/>

During Darwin's lifetime, many geographical features were given his name. An expanse of water adjoining the [[Beagle Channel]] was named ''[[Darwin Sound]]'' by [[Robert FitzRoy]] after Darwin's prompt action, along with two or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing [[glacier]] caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats,<ref>{{Harvnb|FitzRoy|1839|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F10.2&viewtype=text&pageseq=267 216<U+2013>8]}}</ref> and the nearby [[Mount Darwin (Andes)|Mount Darwin]] in the [[Andes]] was named in celebration of Darwin's 25th birthday.<ref>{{harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[http://www.aboutdarwin.com/timeline/time_04.html Darwin's Timeline]}}</ref> When the ''[[HMS Beagle|Beagle]]'' was surveying Australia in 1839, Darwin's friend [[John Lort Stokes]] sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain [[John Clements Wickham|Wickham]] named ''[[Port Darwin]]'': a nearby settlement was renamed [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in 1911, and it became the capital city of Australia's [[Northern Territory]].<ref name=NTDoPaI>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060918153343/http://www.ipe.nt.gov.au/whatwedo/landinformation/place/origins/palmdarwin.html|archivedate=2006-09-18|title=Territory origins| accessdate=2006-12-15|publisher=Northern Territory Department of Planning and Infrastructure, Australia}}</ref>

More than 120 [[species]] and nine [[genus|genera]] have been named after Darwin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinfacts.com/ |title=Charles Darwin 200 years - Things you didn't know about Charles Darwin |accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref> In one example, the group of [[tanager]]s related to those Darwin found in the [[Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands]] became popularly known as "[[Darwin's finches]]" in 1947, fostering inaccurate legends about their significance to his work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sulloway|1982|pp=45<U+2013>47}}</ref>

Darwin's work has continued to be celebrated by numerous publications and events. The [[Linnean Society of London]] has commemorated Darwin's achievements by the award of the [[Darwin<U+2013>Wallace Medal]] since 1908. [[Darwin Day]] has become an annual celebration, and in 2009 worldwide events were arranged for the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{Cite document |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n01/steven-shapin/the-darwin-show |title= The Darwin Show |first=Steven |last=Shapin |authorlink=Steven Shapin |date=7 January 2010 |publisher=[[London Review of Books]] |pages= |quote= |accessdate=2010-01-25 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

==Works==
{{details|List of works by Charles Darwin}}

Darwin was a prolific writer. Even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', as a geologist who had published extensively on [[South America]] and had solved the puzzle of the formation of [[coral atoll]]s, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on [[barnacle]]s. While ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' dominates perceptions of his work, ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' and ''[[The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ''[[The Power of Movement in Plants]]'' were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Balfour|1882}}<br />{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2008}}<br />{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1882}}</ref>

==Notes==
<div class="references-small">
'''<small>I</small>.''' {{Note_label|A|I|none}} Darwin was eminent as a [[naturalist]], [[geologist]], [[biologist]], and [[author]]; after working as a physician's assistant and two years as a [[medical student]] was educated as a [[clergyman]]; and was trained in [[taxidermy]].<ref name=ODNB>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|Browne|2004|}}</ref>

'''<small>II</small>.''' {{Note_label|B|II|none}} [[Robert FitzRoy]] was to become known after the voyage for biblical literalism, but at this time he had considerable interest in Lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when Lyell asked for observations to be made in South America. FitzRoy's diary during the ascent of the River Santa Cruz in [[Patagonia]] recorded his opinion that the plains were [[raised beach]]es, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas. {{Harv|Browne|1995|pp= 186, 414}}

'''<small>III</small>.''' {{Note_label|C|III|none}} See, for example, WILLA volume 4, ''[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/old-WILLA/fall95/DeSimone.html Charlotte Perkins Gilman and the Feminization of Education]'' by Deborah M. De Simone: "Gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of "intellectual chaos" caused by Darwin's Origin of the Species. Marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration."

'''<small>IV</small>.''' {{Note_label|D|IV|none}} See, for example, the song "A lady fair of lineage high" from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Princess Ida]]'', which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

'''<small>V</small>.''' {{Note_label|E|V|none}} [[Genetics|Geneticists]] studied human heredity as [[Mendelian inheritance]], while [[eugenics]] movements sought to manage society, with a focus on [[social class]] in the United Kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the United States, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical [[pseudoscience]]. A shift from voluntary arrangements to "negative" eugenics included [[compulsory sterilisation]] laws in the United States, copied by [[Nazi Germany]] as the basis for [[Nazi eugenics]] based on virulent racism and "[[racial hygiene]]".<br />({{Cite news

'''<small>VI</small>.''' {{Note_label|F|VI|none}} Darwin did not share the then common view that other races are inferior, and said of his [[taxidermy]] tutor [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave, "I used often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant and intelligent man".<ref name=eddy/>

Early in the ''Beagle'' voyage he nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. {{Harv|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=76 74]}} He wrote home about "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." {{harv|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1452.1&pageseq=264 246]}} Regarding [[Fuegians]], he "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like [[Jemmy Button]]: "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here."{{Harv|Darwin|1845|pp= [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F14&viewtype=text&pageseq=218 205, 207<U+2013>208]}}

In the ''[[Descent of Man]]'' he mentioned the Fuegians and Edmonstone when arguing against "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species".<ref>{{Harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=227 214], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=245 232].}}</ref>

He rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of [[Patagonia]]n men, women, and children, "Every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. Who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?" {{harv|Darwin|1845|p-[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F14&pageseq=115 102]}}
