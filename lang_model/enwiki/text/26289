{{Renewable energy sources}}

'''Wind power''' is the conversion of [[wind]] [[energy]] into a useful form of energy, such as using [[wind turbine]]s to make [[electrical power]], [[windmill]]s for mechanical power, wind pumps for [[water pumping]] or [[drainage]], or [[sail]]s to propel ships.

Large [[wind farm]]s consist of hundreds of individual [[wind turbine]]s which are connected to the [[electric power transmission]] network. Offshore wind farms can harness more frequent and powerful winds than are available to land-based installations and have less visual impact on the landscape but construction costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind facilities are used to provide electricity to isolated locations and utility companies increasingly [[Net metering|buy surplus electricity]] produced by small domestic wind turbines.<ref name="Wind Energy">{{cite journal|last=Gipe|first=Paul|title=The Wind Industry's Experience with Aesthetic Criticism|publisher=Leonardo|jstor=1575818}}</ref>

Wind power, as an alternative to [[fossil fuel]]s, is plentiful, [[renewable energy|renewable]], widely distributed, [[Sustainable energy|clean]], produces no [[greenhouse gas]] emissions during operation and uses little land.<ref name="landuse">{{cite doi|10.1016/j.rser.2008.09.017}}</ref> Any [[Environmental impact of wind power|effects on the environment]] are generally less problematic than those from other power sources. As of 2011, Denmark is generating more than a quarter of its electricity from wind. 83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis.<ref name=ren212011/> In 2010 wind energy production was over 2.5% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing rapidly at more than 25% per annum. The monetary cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations.<ref name="eiadoe"/> Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation, the construction of wind farms is not universally welcomed due to [[aesthetics]].<ref name=mar/><ref>{{cite web|title=Carbon footprint of electricity generation|publisher=UK Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology|date=October 2006|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn268.pdf|location=Postnote Number 268|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=com/><ref name=vipublic/><ref name=eon/><ref name=thefacts/><ref name=pollingreport>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/energy.htm|title=Energy|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref>

Wind power is very consistent from year to year but has significant variation over shorter time scales. The [[Intermittent power sources|intermittency]] of wind seldom creates problems when used to supply up to 20% of total electricity demand,<ref name="ieawind"/> but as the proportion increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur.<ref name="claverton-energy.com"/> Power management techniques such as having excess capacity storage, dispatchable backing sources, storage such as [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], exporting and importing power to neighboring areas or reducing demand when wind production is low, can greatly mitigate these problems.<ref name="eirgrid impact"/>

[[File:Fourteenth century windmill.png|thumb|left|Medieval depiction of a [[wind mill]]]]

[[Sailboats]] and [[sailing ship]]s have been using wind power for thousands of years, and architects have used wind-driven [[natural ventilation]] in buildings since similarly ancient times. The use of wind to provide mechanical power came somewhat later in antiquity.

== Wind energy ==
[[File:United States Wind Resources and Transmission Lines map.jpg|thumb|330px|left|Map of available wind power for the [[Wind power in the United States|United States]]. Color codes indicate wind power density class. (click to see larger)]]

Wind energy is the [[kinetic energy]] of air in motion, also called [[wind]].
Total wind energy flowing through an imaginary area ''A'' during the time ''t'' is:

:<math>E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(Avt\rho)v^2 = \frac{1}{2}At\rho v^3,</math><ref name=physics>{{cite web|url=https://dspace.lasrworks.org/bitstream/handle/10349/145/fulltext.pdf |title=Harvesting the Wind: The Physics of Wind Turbines |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref>

where ''<U+03C1>'' is the [[density of air]]; ''v'' is the wind [[speed]]; ''Avt'' is the volume of air passing through ''A'' (which is considered perpendicular to the direction of the wind); ''Avt<U+03C1>'' is therefore the mass ''m'' passing per unit time. Note that <U+00BD> ''<U+03C1>v''<sup>2</sup> is the kinetic energy of the moving air per unit volume.

Power is energy per unit time, so the wind power incident on ''A'' (e.g. equal to the rotor area of a wind turbine) is:

:<math>P = \frac{E}{t} = \frac{1}{2}A\rho v^3.</math><ref name=physics />

Wind power in an open air stream is thus ''proportional'' to the ''third power'' of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles.  Wind turbines for grid electricity therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds.

Wind is the movement of air across the surface of the Earth, affected by areas of high pressure and of low pressure.<ref name="what is wind?">{{cite web|url=http://www.bwea.com/edu/wind.html|title=What is wind?|last=Anon|year=2010|work=Renewable UK: Education and careers|publisher=Renewable UK|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> The surface of the Earth is heated unevenly by the Sun, depending on factors such as the angle of incidence of the sun's rays at the surface (which differs with latitude and time of day) and whether the land is open or covered with vegetation. Also, large bodies of water, such as the oceans, heat up and cool down slower than the land. The heat energy absorbed at the Earth's surface is transferred to the air directly above it and, as warmer air is less dense than cooler air, it rises above the cool air to form areas of high pressure and thus pressure differentials. The rotation of the Earth drags the atmosphere around with it causing turbulence. These effects combine to cause a constantly varying pattern of winds across the surface of the Earth.<ref name="what is wind?"/>

The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/how-much-wind-energy-is-there-brian-hurley-wind-site-evaluation-ltd.html|title=How Much Wind Energy is there? <U+2013> Brian Hurley <U+2013> Wind Site Evaluation Ltd|last=Hurley|first=Brian|publisher=Claverton Group|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Axel Kleidon of the Max Planck Institute in Germany, carried out a "top down" calculation on how much wind energy there is, starting with the incoming solar radiation that drives the winds by creating temperature differences in the atmosphere. He concluded that somewhere between 18 TW and 68 TW could be extracted.<ref name=nsc2012/> Cristina Archer and [[Mark Z. Jacobson]] presented a "bottom-up" estimate, which unlike Kleidon's are based on actual measurements of wind speeds, and found that there is 1700 TW of wind power at an altitude of 100 metres over land and sea. Of this, "between 72 and 170 TW could be extracted in a practical and cost-competitive manner".<ref name=nsc2012>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328491.700-power-paradox-clean-might-not-be-green-forever.html?full=true&print=true |title=Power paradox: Clean might not be green forever |author=Anil Ananthaswamy and Michael Le Page |date=30 January 2012 |work=New Scientist }}</ref>

=== Distribution of wind speed ===
[[File:Lee Ranch Wind Speed Frequency.svg|thumb|right|Distribution of wind speed (red) and energy (blue) for all of 2002 at the Lee Ranch facility in Colorado. The histogram shows measured data, while the curve is the Rayleigh model distribution for the same average wind speed.]]

The strength of wind varies, and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there. To assess the frequency of wind speeds at a particular location, a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed data. Different locations will have different wind speed distributions. The [[Weibull distribution|Weibull]] model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly wind speeds at many locations. The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a [[Rayleigh distribution]] can be used as a less accurate, but simpler model.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wind-power-program.com/wind_statistics.htm |title=Wind statistics and the Weibull distribution |publisher=Wind-power-program.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref>

=== High altitude winds ===
Power generation from winds usually comes from winds very close to the surface of the earth.  Winds at higher altitudes are stronger and more consistent.  Recent years have seen significant advances in technologies meant to [[High-altitude wind power|generate electricity from high altitude winds]].<ref>{{cite web|author=by bruce stutz |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/high_altitude_wind_energy_huge_potential_and_hurdles/2576/ |title=High-Altitude Wind Energy: Huge Potential <U+2014> And Hurdles |publisher=E360.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref>

== Wind farms ==
[[File:Windfarm - geograph.org.uk - 150717.jpg|thumb|Two of the wind turbines at the [[Black Law Wind Farm]] in Scotland]]
{{Main|Wind farm}}

A wind farm is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used for production of electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

Almost all large wind turbines have the same design&nbsp;<U+2014> a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with three blades, attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower.  In a [[wind farm]], individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage (often 34.5 kV), power collection system and communications network. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a [[transformer]] for connection to the high voltage [[electric power transmission]] system.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the US. As of 2012, the [[Alta Wind Energy Center]] is the largest onshore wind farm in the world at 1020 MW, followed by the [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] (845 MW), and the [[Roscoe Wind Farm]] (781.5 MW). As of September 2012, the [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm]] and the [[Thanet Wind Farm]] in the UK are the largest offshore wind farms in the world at 317 MW and 300 MW, followed by [[Horns Rev|Horns Rev II]] (209 MW) in Denmark.

There are many large wind farms under construction including; [[London Array|The London Array (offshore)]] (1000 MW), [[BARD Offshore 1]] (400 MW), [[Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm]] (317 MW), [[Lincs Wind Farm|Lincs Wind Farm (offshore)]], [[Clyde Wind Farm]] (548 MW), [[Greater Gabbard wind farm]] (500 MW), [[Macarthur Wind Farm]] (420 MW), [[Lower Snake River Wind Project]] (343 MW) and [[Walney Wind Farm]] (367 MW).

=== Feeding into grid ===
[[Induction generator]]s, often used for wind power, require [[reactive power]] for [[Excitation (magnetic)|excitation]] so [[Electrical substation|substations]] used in wind-power collection systems include substantial [[capacitor]] banks for [[power factor correction]].<ref>[http://www.uwig.org/wind_turbine_tech_charac_draft_final.pdf Wind Generation Technical Characteristics] p.17</ref> Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so [[Wind energy software|extensive modelling]] of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults (see: [[Low voltage ride through]]). In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators. [[Doubly fed electric machine|Doubly fed machines]] generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Greening of IT: How Companies Can Make a Difference for the Environment|last=Lamb|first=John|year=2009|page=261|isbn=ISBN 978-0-13-715083-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Alternative Energy Technologies|last=Castellano|first=Robert|year=2012|page=26|isbn=ISBN 978-2813000767}}</ref> Transmission systems operators will supply a wind farm developer with a ''grid code'' to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid.

=== Offshore wind power ===
{{Main|Offshore wind power}}
[[File:Sund mpazdziora.JPG|thumb|left|Aerial view of [[Lillgrund Wind Farm]], Sweden]]

Offshore wind power refers to the construction of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electricity. These installations can utilise the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects.  However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.<ref name="Hulazan">{{cite web|url=http://www.renewables-info.com/drawbacks_and_benefits/offshore_wind_power_%E2%80%93_advantages_and_disadvantages.html|title=Offshore wind power <U+2013> Advantages and disadvantages |last=Hulazan|first=Ned|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Renewable Energy Articles|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="Millborrow">{{cite web|url=http://www.windpowermonthly.com/go/europe/news/1021043/Cutting-cost-offshore-wind-energy/|title=Cutting the cost of offshore wind energy|last=Millborrow|first=David|date=6 August 2010|work=Wind Power Monthly|publisher=Haymarket|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> As of 2011, offshore wind farms were at least 3 times more expensive than onshore wind farms of the same nominal power<ref name="Jamieson"/> but these costs are expected to fall as the industry matures.<ref name="Bloomberg">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/wind-power-seen-surging-as-custom-barges-cut-set-up-costs.html|title=Wind Power Seen Surging as Custom Barges Cut Set-up Costs|last= Morales |first=Alex|last2=Bakewell|first2=Sally  |date=10 April 2012|work=Blloomberg News|publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Siemens]] and [[Vestas]] are the leading turbine suppliers for offshore wind power. [[DONG Energy]], [[Vattenfall]] and [[E.ON]] are the leading offshore operators.<ref name=btm2010o/> As of October 2010, 3.16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational, mainly in Northern Europe. According to [[BTM Consult]], more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed before the end of 2014 and the UK and Germany will become the two leading markets. Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020, with significant contributions from China and the US.<ref name="btm2010o"/>

=== Growth trends ===
[[Image:Total Installed Wind Capacity 1197-2020 -MW-.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Worldwide installed capacity 1997<U+2013>2020 [MW], developments and prognosis. Data source: WWEA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwindea.org/home/images/stories/worldwindenergyreport2009_s.pdf|title=World Wind Energy Association|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref>]]
[[File:GlobalWindPowerCumulativeCapacity-withForcast.png|thumb|upright=1.05|right|Worldwide installed wind power capacity forecast (Source: Global Wind Energy Council)<ref name="GWEC_Market" /><ref name="GWEC_Forcast"/>]]

In 2010, more than half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America. This was largely from new construction in China, which accounted for nearly half the new wind installations (16.5 GW).<ref name="increasesBy2010"/>

Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) figures show that 2007 recorded an increase of installed capacity of 20&nbsp;GW, taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 94&nbsp;GW, up from 74&nbsp;GW in 2006. Despite constraints facing supply chains for wind turbines, the annual market for wind continued to increase at an estimated rate of 37%, following 32% growth in 2006. In terms of economic value, the wind energy sector has become one of the important players in the energy markets, with the total value of new generating equipment installed in 2007 reaching <U+20AC>25 billion, or US$36 billion.<ref name="gwec2007"/>

Although the [[wind power industry]] was affected by the [[Late-2000s recession|global financial crisis]] in 2009 and 2010, a [[BTM Consult]] five-year forecast up to 2013 projects substantial growth. Over the past five years the average growth in new installations has been 27.6 percent each year. In the forecast to 2013 the expected average annual growth rate is 15.7 percent.<ref name="re" /><ref name="bt" /> More than 200&nbsp;GW of new wind power capacity could come on line before the end of 2013. Wind power market penetration is expected to reach 3.35 percent by 2013 and 8 percent by 2018.<ref name=re /><ref name=bt />

=== Capacity factor ===
Since wind speed is not constant, a wind farm's annual [[energy]] production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the [[capacity factor]]. Typical capacity factors are 20<U+2013>50%, with values at the upper end of the range in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine improvements.<ref name="ceereCapInter" /><ref name=capacity-factor-50>{{cite web|last=Shahan |first=Zachary |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2012/07/27/wind-turbine-net-capacity-factor-50-the-new-normal/ |title=Wind Turbine Net Capacity Factor <U+2014> 50% the New Normal? |publisher=Cleantechnica.com |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref><ref group="nb">

For example, a 1&nbsp;MW turbine with a capacity factor of 35% will not produce 8,760&nbsp;MW<U+00B7>h in a year (1 <U+00D7> 24 <U+00D7> 365), but only 1 <U+00D7> 0.35 <U+00D7> 24 <U+00D7> 365&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,066&nbsp;MW<U+00B7>h, averaging to 0.35&nbsp;MW.

</ref> Online data is available for some locations and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output.<ref name="MassMaritime"/><ref name="iesoOntarioWind"/>

Unlike fueled generating plants the capacity factor is affected by several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site but also the [[Electric generator|generator]] size. A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less [[Electric power|electricity]] (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may [[Stall (flight)|stall]] out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor would be aimed for, of around 40<U+2013>50%.<ref name="capFactors"/><ref name=capacity-factor-50/>

In a 2008 study released by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the capacity factor achieved by the U.S. wind turbine fleet is shown to be increasing as the technology improves. The capacity factor achieved by new wind turbines in 2010 reached 50%.<ref name="Windpowering" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.openei.org/apps/TCDB/ |title=Transparent Cost Database |publisher=En.openei.org |date=2009-03-20 |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref>

=== Penetration ===
Wind energy penetration refers to the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total available generation capacity. There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit for a particular [[Electrical grid|grid]] will depend on the existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for storage or demand management and other factors. An interconnected electricity grid will already include [[Operating reserve|reserve generating]] and [[Electric power transmission#Capacity|transmission capacity]] to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind plants. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty.<ref name="tacklingUS" /> These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable energy]] or [[hydropower]] with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electricity when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.<ref name="NGestimates"/><ref name="minnesota"/><ref name="ESB2004Study"/><ref name="sinclairMerz"/>

A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different durations of time. On an annual basis, as of 2011, few grid systems have penetration levels above five percent: Denmark <U+2013> 26%, Portugal <U+2013> 17%, Spain <U+2013> 15%, Ireland <U+2013> 14%, and Germany <U+2013> 9%.<ref name="wtmr_2010_eere">{{cite book|title=2010 Wind Technologies Market Report|publisher=EERE, U.S. Department of Energy|page=7}}</ref> For the U.S. in 2011, the penetration level was estimated at 2.9%.<ref name="wtmr_2010_eere" /> To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis<U+2014>or less<U+2014>wind can supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry can take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry can include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, which allow long term storage, facilitating 100% energy from [[variable renewable energy]].<ref>{{cite web|author=by bruce stutz |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/the_challenge_for_green_energy_how_to_store_excess_electricity/2170/ |title=The Challenge for Green Energy: How to Store Excess Electricity |publisher=E360.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://revmodo.com/2012/08/23/power-to-gas-technology-turns-excess-wind-energy-into-natural-gas/ |title=Power To Gas Technology Turns Excess Wind Energy Into Natural Gas |publisher=Revmodo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref> Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electricity on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats (mixer valves prevent anyone from being scalded).<ref group="nb">Mixer valves are commonly used in homes with hot water heating, but need to be added to homes with remote access.

Electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally.  However, wind is always in constant supply somewhere, making it a dependable source of energy because it will never expire or become extinct. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Like other electricity sources, wind energy must be scheduled. Wind power forecasting methods are used, but predictability of wind plant output remains low for short-term operation. There is an 80% chance that wind output will change less than 10% in an hour and a 40% chance that it will change 10% or more in 5 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/wind/systemsintegration/system_integration_basics.html|title=Wind Systems Integration Basics|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120607000124/http://www.nrel.gov/wind/systemsintegration/system_integration_basics.html|archivedate=7 June 2012}}</ref> Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-[[Intermittent power sources#Terminology|dispatchable]] nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental [[operating reserve]], and (at high penetration levels) could require an increase in the already existing [[energy demand management]], [[load shedding]], storage solutions or system interconnection with [[High-voltage direct current|HVDC]] cables. At low levels of wind penetration, fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large generating units require reserve capacity that can also compensate for variability of wind generation. Wind power can be replaced by other power sources during low wind periods. Transmission networks must already cope with outages of generation plant and daily changes in electrical demand. Systems with large wind capacity components may need more spinning reserve (plants operating at less than full load).<ref name="is windpower reliable"/><ref name="clavertonReliable"/>

While the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary, as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.uwig.org/IEA_Report_on_variability.pdf |title=Variability of Wind Power and other Renewables: Management Options and Strategies  |publisher=IEA |year=2005 |format=PDF }}</ref> Studies by Graham Sinden (2009) suggest that, in practice, the variations in thousands of wind turbines, spread out over several different sites and wind regimes, are smoothed.  As the distance between sites increases, the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites, decreases.<ref name = Diesendorf>{{Cite document| author = Diesendorf, Mark |year= 2007| title =[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]|page =119| quote =[[Graham Sinden]] analysed over 30 years of hourly wind speed data from 66 sites spread out over the United Kingdom.  He found that the correlation coefficient of wind power fell from 0.6 at 200&nbsp;km to 0.25 at 600&nbsp;km separation (a perfect correlation would have a coefficient equal to 1.0.) There were no hours in the data set where wind speed was below the cut-in wind speed of a modern wind turbine throughout the United Kingdom, and low wind speed events affecting more than 90 per cent of the United Kingdom had an average recurrent rate of only one hour per year.| postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location, forecasting their variation, and integrating them with dispatchable renewables, flexible fueled generators, and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet our needs reliably. Integrating ever-higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world:<ref name=Lovins11>{{cite book|authorlink=Amory Lovins|year=2011|title=[[Reinventing Fire]]|publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing|page=199}}</ref>
<blockquote>
In 2009, eight American and three European authorities, writing in the leading electrical engineers' professional journal, didn't find "a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids". In fact, not one of more than 200 international studies, nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions, nor the [[International Energy Agency]], has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30% variable renewable supplies into the grid, and in some studies much more. <U+2013> ''Reinventing Fire''<ref name=Lovins11/>
</blockquote>

[[Solar power]] tends to be complementary to wind.<ref name="windsun" /><ref name="smallWindSystems" /> On daily to weekly timescales, [[high pressure area]]s tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas [[low pressure area]]s tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter.<ref group="nb">[[Wind power in California|California]] and [[Wind power in Minnesota|Minnesota]] are exceptions.</ref><ref name="cleveland_water_crib" /> Thus the intermittencies of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the [[University of Kassel]] pilot-tested a [[virtual power plant|combined power plant]] linking solar, wind, [[biogas]] and [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|hydrostorage]] to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.<ref name="combined_power_plant"/>

A 2006 [[International Energy Agency]] forum presented costs for managing intermittency as a function of wind-energy's share of total capacity for several countries, as shown in the table on the right. Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009, generally agree that variability of wind needs to be taken into account, but it does not make the grid unmanageable. The additional costs, which are modest, can be quantified.<ref name="abbess"/>

A report on Denmark's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002.<ref name="Denmark"/> Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC.<ref name="Czisch-Giebel"/> Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power.<ref name="Denmark" /> According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced to be used as reliable, [[baseload power|baseload electric power]], as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.<ref name="connecting_wind_farms" /><ref name="Archer2007" />

Conversely, on particularly windy days, even with penetration levels of 16%, wind power generation can surpass all other electricity sources in a country. In Spain, on 16 April 2012 wind power production reached the highest percentage of electricity production till then, with wind farms covering 60.46% of the total demand.<ref name="eolica"/>

=== Energy storage ===
In general, hydroelectricity complements wind power very well. When the wind is blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric plants can temporarily hold back their water, and when the wind drops they can rapidly increase production again giving a very even power supply.

[[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] or other forms of [[grid energy storage]] can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed.<ref name="Mitchell 2006" /> The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level - low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage - as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this [[arbitrage]] can offset the cost and losses of storage; the cost of storage may add 25% to the cost of any wind energy stored but it is not envisaged that this would apply to a large proportion of wind energy generated. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW [[Dinorwig pumped storage plant]] evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.<ref name="dinorwig" /><ref name="futureStorage" />

In particular geographic regions, peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power. In the US states of California and [[Wind power in Texas|Texas]], for example, hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of [[air conditioning]]. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of [[geothermal heat pump]]s by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient;<ref name="geothermal_incentive" /> widespread adoption of this technology would better match electricity demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds. Another option is to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC "[[Super grid]]". In the U.S. it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least $60 billion.<ref name="slogin" />

Germany has an installed capacity of wind and solar that exceeds daily demand, and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries. A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80% of demand, which will become necessary when most of Europe's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power. Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days [[Global strategic petroleum reserves|strategic reserves]] of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electricity storage, instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201202/20120208ATT37544/20120208ATT37544EN.pdf|title=European Renewable Energy Network|format=PDF|page=71}}</ref>

=== Capacity credit and fuel savings ===
The capacity credit of wind is estimated by determining the capacity of conventional plants displaced by wind power, whilst maintaining the same degree of system security,.<ref name="The facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-2-grid-integration/chapter-6-wind-power-contribution-to-system-adequacy/capacity-credit-of-wind-power/|title=Capacity Credit of Wind Power:  Capacity credit is the measure for firm wind power|last=Anon|work=Wind Energy the Facts|publisher=EWEA|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> However, the precise value is irrelevant since the main value of wind is its fuel and {{CO2}} savings,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masterresource.org/2012/02/wind-spin/ |title=Wind Spin: Misdirection and Fluff by a Taxpayer-enabled Industry |publisher=Masterresource.org |date=2012-02-24 |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref> and wind is not expected to be constantly available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/part-2-grid-integration/chapter-6-wind-power-contribution-to-system-adequacy/capacity-credit-of-wind-power/capacity-credit-values-of-wind-power.html |title=Capacity Credit Values of Wind Power |publisher=Wind-energy-the-facts.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref>

Wind power has low ongoing costs, but a moderate capital cost. The [[marginal cost]] of wind energy once a plant is constructed is usually less than 1 cent per kW<U+00B7>h.<ref name="Patel"/> This cost has reduced as wind turbine technology improved. There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades, improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs have continued to decline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/08/14/banner-year-us-wind-industry |title=A Banner Year for the U.S. Wind Industry |author=David Danielson |date=14 August 2012 |work=Whitehouse Blog }}</ref>

The estimated [[average cost]] per unit incorporates the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities, borrowed funds, return to investors (including cost of risk), estimated annual production, and other components, averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment, which may be in excess of twenty years. Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially. In 2004, wind energy cost a fifth of what it did in the 1980s, and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi-megawatt [[Wind turbine|turbines]] were mass-produced.<ref name="helming"/> {{As of|2012}} capital costs for wind turbines are substantially lower than 2008<U+2013>2010 but are still above 2002 levels.<ref>

The U.S. wind industry generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity.<ref name=usdept>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/49222.pdf |title=Strengthening America's Energy Security with Offshore Wind |date = February 2011|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy }}</ref> Wind projects provide local taxes, or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land.<ref name=nine/><ref>{{cite web| title =Direct Federal Financial Interventions and Subsidies in Energy in Fiscal Year 2010| work =Report| publisher =Energy Information Administration | date =1 August 2011| url =http://www.eia.gov/analysis/requests/subsidy/| accessdate =29 April 2012}}</ref> Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development. Wind energy benefits from [[subsidy|subsidies]] in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities.

In the US, wind power receives a production tax credit (PTC) of 1.5<U+00A2>/kWh in 1993 dollars for each kW<U+00B7>h produced, for the first ten years; at 2.2 cents per kW<U+00B7>h in 2012, the credit was renewed on January 2, 2012, to include construction begun in 2013. A 30% tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the PTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/increase-renewables/production-tax-credit-for.html |title=Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy |publisher=Ucsusa.org |date=2013-01-02 |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=US13F&re=1&ee=1 |title=Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (PTC) |publisher=Dsireusa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref> Another tax benefit is [[accelerated depreciation]]. Many American states also provide incentives, such as exemption from property tax, mandated purchases, and additional markets for "[[Renewable Energy Certificates|green credits]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/summarytables/finre.cfm |title=Financial Incentives for Renewable Energy |publisher=Dsireusa.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref> The [[Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008]] contains extensions of credits for wind, including microturbines. Countries such as [[Wind Power Production Incentive|Canada]] and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction, such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation, with assured grid access (sometimes referred to as [[feed-in tariff]]s). These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electricity prices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/11/italian-small-wind-growing-with-feed-in-tariffs |title=Italian Small Wind Growing with Feed-in Tariffs |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmia.net/Portals/0/Repository/GWEC%20China%20wind%20tariffs.57301d14-f357-4176-9ebb-7d6921a7ef9d.pdf |title=The Development of Wind Power Tariffs in China |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-11}}</ref>

Secondary market forces also provide incentives for businesses to use wind-generated power, even if there is a [[Renewable Energy Certificates|premium price for the electricity]]. For example, [[Corporate social responsibility|socially responsible manufacturers]] pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure. Companies use wind-generated power, and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong "green" efforts. In the US the organization Green-e monitors business compliance with these renewable energy credits.<ref name="green-e"/>

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.<ref name=mar/><ref name="windmeasurementinternational">{{cite web| url= http://www.windmeasurementinternational.com/wind-info/wind-energy_faq.php | title=FAQ| publisher=Wind Measurement International| accessdate=11 January 2013}}</ref>

== Politics ==

=== Central government ===
Fossil fuels are [[energy subsidies|subsidized by many governments]], and wind power and other forms of renewable energy are also often subsidized. For example a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elistore.org/Data/products/d19_07.pdf|title=Estimating U.S. Government Subsidies to Energy Sources: 2002-2008|publisher=Environmental Law Institute|date=September 2009|format=PDF|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002<U+2013>2008 period.  The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74&nbsp;billion for energy subsidies to support [[R&D]] for [[nuclear power]] ($50 billion) and [[fossil fuels]] ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003.  During this same time frame, [[renewable energy]] technologies and [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] received a total of US$26&nbsp;billion.  It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors, namely [[solar power]], wind power, and [[biofuels]].<ref name=per/>  History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.<ref name=per>Pernick, Ron and Wilder, Clint (2007). ''[[The Clean Tech Revolution]]: The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity'', p. 280.</ref>

According to the [[International Energy Agency|International Energy Agency (IEA)]] (2011) energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers, raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production. "Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits. Subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits".<ref name=IEA-FS2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf |title=World Energy Outlook 2011 Factsheet How will global energy markets evolve to 2035?|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120204112700/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/docs/weo2011/factsheets.pdf|archivedate=4 February 2012 |publisher=IEA |date=November 2011}}</ref> In November 2011, an IEA report entitled ''Deploying Renewables 2011'' said "subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits". The IEA's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand.

In the US, the wind power industry has recently increased its lobbying efforts considerably, spending about $5 million in 2009 after years of relative obscurity in Washington.<ref name="LobbyingAfter"/> By comparison, the US nuclear industry alone spent over $650 million on its lobbying efforts and campaign contributions during a single ten-year period ending in 2008.<ref name="spendingOnNuclear"/><ref>

Following the [[2011 Japanese nuclear accidents]], Germany's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy commercialization]], with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,752791,00.html |title=Will Nuke Phase-Out Make Offshore Farms Attractive? |author=Stefan Schultz |date=23 March 2011 |work=Der Spiegel }}</ref>

Commenting on the [[Energy policy of the European Union|EU's 2020 renewable energy target]], economist Professor [[Dieter Helm]] is critical of how the costs of wind power are cited by lobbyists. Helm also says that the problem of intermittent supply will probably lead to another [[dash for gas]] or dash for coal in Europe, possibly with a negative impact on [[energy security]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Helm |first=Dieter|date=October 2009|title=EU climate-change policy<U+2014>a critique|journal=The Economics and Politics of Climate Change|publisher=OUP|url=http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/sites/default/files/SS_EU_CC_Critique_0.pdf}}</ref> A [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] report (2008) on renewable energy in the UK reported a "concern over the prospective role of wind generated and other intermittent sources of electricity in the UK, in the absence of a break-through in electricity storage technology or the integration of the UK grid with that of continental Europe".<ref name="FourthReport"/>

A 2003 survey of residents living around [[Scotland]]'s 10 existing wind farms found high levels of community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer the majority of their electricity to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwea.com/media/news/goodneighbours.html |title=Wind farms make good neighbours|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120215024756/http://www.bwea.com/media/news/goodneighbours.html|archivedate=15 February 2012}}</ref> A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs.

== Small-scale wind power ==
{{Further|Microgeneration}}
[[Image:Tassa 5KW 2 ElectronSolarEnergy2.jpg|thumb|left|A 5 kilowatt [[vertical axis wind turbine]]]]

Small-scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to 50&nbsp;kW of electrical power.<ref name="smallScaleCarbonTrust"/> Isolated communities, that may otherwise rely on [[Diesel generator|diesel]] generators, may use wind turbines as an alternative. Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electricity for economic reasons, or to reduce their [[carbon footprint]]. Wind turbines have been used for household electricity generation in conjunction with [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] storage over many decades in remote areas.<ref name="Dodge"/>

Grid-connected domestic wind turbines may use [[grid energy storage]], thus replacing purchased electricity with locally produced power when available. The surplus power produced by domestic microgenerators can, in some jurisdictions, be fed into the network and sold to the utility company, producing a retail credit for the microgenerators' owners to offset their energy costs.<ref name="SmallElectricity"/><ref name="home-made"/>

Off-grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries, [[photovoltaic]] or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2009/05/13/exploiting-the-downsides-of-wind-and-solar/|title=Wind, Solar-Powered Street Lights Only Need a Charge Once Every Four Days|last=Kart|first=Jeff|date=13 May 2009|work=Clean Technica|publisher=Clean Technica|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref>

In locations near or around a group of high-rise buildings, wind shear generates areas of intense turbulence, especially at street-level.<ref name="UrbanWindDefinition"/> The risks associated with mechanical or catastrophic failure have thus plagued urban wind development in densely populated areas, rendering the costs of insuring urban wind systems prohibitive.<ref name="An_Urban_Experiment_in_Renewable_Energy"/>
Moreover, quantifying the amount of wind in urban areas has been difficult, as little is known about the actual wind resources of towns and cities.<ref name="WindyCities"/>

A [[Carbon Trust]] study into the potential of small-scale wind energy in the UK, published in 2010, found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1.5 terawatt hours (TW<U+00B7>h) per year of electricity (0.4% of total UK electricity consumption), saving 0.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>) emission savings. This is based on the assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electricity, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW<U+00B7>h.<ref name="CarbonSmallTrust"/> A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored [[Energy Saving Trust]] in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40 percent of the country's electricity needs by 2050.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamer|first=Mick|date=21 January 2006|title=The rooftop power revolution |journal=New Scientist|publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd.|issue=2535|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925351.400-the-rooftop-power-revolution.html?full=true#bx253514B1|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>

[[Distributed generation]] from [[renewable resource]]s is increasing as a consequence of the increased awareness of [[climate change]]. The electronic interfaces required to connect renewable generation units with the [[utility]] system can include additional functions, such as the active filtering to enhance the power quality.<ref name="ActiveFiltering"/>
