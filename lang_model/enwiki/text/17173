{{Main|Economic history of India|Timeline of the economy of India}}

===Pre-colonial period (up to 1773)===
[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|The [[spice trade]] between India and Europe was the main catalyst for the ''[[Age of Discovery]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last = Donkin|first = Robin A.|authorlink = Robin Donkin|title = Between East and West: The Moluccas and the Traffic in Spices Up to the Arrival of Europeans|publisher = Diane Publishing Company|month = August|year = 2003|isbn = 0-87169-248-1}}</ref>]]
The citizens of the [[Indus Valley civilisation]], a permanent settlement that flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well-planned streets, a drainage system and [[water supply]] reveals their knowledge of [[urban planning]], which included the world's first urban [[sanitation]] systems and the existence of a form of [[municipal government]].<ref name="Discovery-1">{{cite book|author=[[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru, Jawaharlal]]|title=[[The Discovery of India]]|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1946|isbn=0-14-303103-1}}</ref>

Maritime trade was carried out extensively between [[South India]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeast]] and [[West Asia]] from early times until around the fourteenth century AD. Both the [[Malabar]] and [[Coromandel Coast]]s were the sites of important trading centres from as early as the first century BC, used for import and export as well as transit points between the [[Mediterranean]] region and southeast Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Raychaudhuri|Habib|2004|pp=17<U+2013>18}}</ref> Over time, traders organised themselves into associations which received state patronage. However, state patronage for overseas trade came to an end by the thirteenth century AD, when it was largely taken over by the local Jewish and [[Muslim]] communities, initially on the Malabar and subsequently on the Coromandel coast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Raychaudhuri|Habib|2004|pp=40<U+2013>41}}</ref> Further north, the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] and [[Bengal]] coasts played an important role in maritime trade, and the [[Gangetic plains]] and the [[Indus valley]] housed several centres of river-borne commerce. Most overland trade was carried out via the [[Khyber Pass]] connecting the [[Punjab region]] with Afghanistan and onward to the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Raychaudhuri|Habib|2004|pp=10<U+2013>13}}</ref> Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins, [[barter]] was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while their craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services.<ref name="Dutt-1">{{Harvnb|Datt|Sundharam|2009|page=14}}</ref>

Religion, especially [[Hinduism]] and the [[caste]] and the [[joint family]] systems, played an influential role in shaping economic activities.<ref name="sankaran-1">{{cite book|author=Sankaran, S|title=Indian Economy: Problems, Policies and Development|publisher=Margham Publications|year=1994|id=ISBN|page=50|chapter=3}}</ref> The caste system functioned much like medieval European [[guild]]s, ensuring the [[division of labour]], providing for the training of apprentices and, in some cases, allowing manufacturers to achieve narrow specialisation. For instance, in certain regions, producing each variety of cloth was the specialty of a particular sub-caste. Textiles such as [[muslin]], [[Calico (textile)|Calicos]], [[shawl]]s, and agricultural products such as [[black pepper|pepper]], [[cinnamon]], [[opium]] and [[indigo]] were exported to [[Europe]], the Middle East and South East Asia in return for gold and silver.<ref name="Dutt-2">{{Harvnb|Datt|Sundharam|2009|page=15}}</ref>

Assessment of India's pre-colonial economy is mostly qualitative, owing to the lack of quantitative information. The Mughal economy functioned on an elaborate system of [[coin]]ed [[currency]], land revenue and trade. Gold, silver and copper coins were issued by the royal [[mint (coin)|mints]] which functioned on the basis of [[Commodity money|free coinage]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Raychaudhuri|Habib|2004|pp=360<U+2013>361}}</ref> The political stability and uniform revenue policy resulting from a centralised administration under the Mughals, coupled with a well-developed internal trade network, ensured that India, before the arrival of the British, was to a large extent economically unified, despite having a traditional agrarian economy characterised by a predominance of [[subsistence agriculture]] dependent on primitive technology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|p=3}}</ref> After the decline of the [[Mughals]], western, central and parts of south and north India were integrated and administered by the [[Maratha Empire]]. After the loss at the [[Third Battle of Panipat]], the Maratha Empire disintegrated into several confederate states, and the resulting political instability and armed conflict severely affected economic life in several parts of the country, although this was compensated for to some extent by localised prosperity in the new provincial kingdoms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|pp=5<U+2013>8}}</ref> By the end of the eighteenth century, the British [[East India Company]] entered the Indian political theatre and established its dominance over other European powers. This marked a determinative shift in India's trade, and a less powerful impact on the rest of the economy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|p=26}}</ref>

===Colonial period (1773<U+2013>1947)===

{{quotation| There is no doubt that our grievances against the British Empire had a sound basis. As the painstaking statistical work of the Cambridge historian Angus Maddison has shown, India's share of world income collapsed from 22.6% in 1700, almost equal to Europe's share of 23.3% at that time, to as low as 3.8% in 1952.

[[Company rule in India]] brought a major change in the taxation and agricultural policies, which tended to promote commercialisation of agriculture with a focus on trade, resulting in decreased production of food crops, mass impoverishment and destitution of farmers, and in the short term, led to numerous famines.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|pp=158<U+2013>160}}</ref> The economic policies of the [[British Raj]] caused a severe decline in the [[handicrafts]] and [[handloom]] sectors, due to reduced demand and dipping employment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|pp=538<U+2013>540}}</ref> After the removal of international restrictions by the [[East India Company#Charter Act 1813|Charter of 1813]], Indian trade expanded substantially and over the long term showed an upward trend.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|pp=826<U+2013>827}}</ref> The result was a significant transfer of capital from India to England, which, due to the colonial policies of the British, led to a massive drain of revenue rather than any systematic effort at modernisation of the domestic economy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|pp=876<U+2013>877}}</ref>

India's [[colonisation]] by the British created an institutional environment that, on paper, guaranteed [[property rights]] among the colonisers, encouraged [[free trade]], and created a single currency with [[fixed exchange rates]], standardised weights and measures and [[capital market]]s. It also established a well-developed system of [[Rail transport in India|railways]] and telegraphs, a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference, a common-law and an adversarial legal system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|pp=291<U+2013>292}}</ref> This coincided with major changes in the world economy &ndash; industrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world,<ref name="roy-2">{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|p = 1}}</ref> with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population, a largely illiterate and unskilled labour force, and extremely inadequate infrastructure.<ref name="AtIndependence">{{Harvnb|Datt|Sundharam|2009|p=179}}</ref>

The 1872 census revealed that 91.3% of the population of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages,<ref name="non-urban">{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|p=519}}</ref> and urbanisation generally remained sluggish until the 1920s, due to the lack of industrialisation and absence of adequate transportation. Subsequently, the policy of discriminating protection (where certain important industries were given financial protection by the state), coupled with the [[Second World War]], saw the development and dispersal of industries, encouraging rural-urban migration, and in particular the large port cities of [[Bombay]], [[Calcutta]] and [[Madras]] grew rapidly. Despite this, only one-sixth of India's population lived in cities by 1951.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kumar|2005|pp=520<U+2013>521}}</ref>

The impact of the British rule on India's economy is a controversial topic. Leaders of the [[Indian independence movement]] and left-nationalist [[economic history|economic historians]] have blamed colonial rule for the dismal state of India's economy in its aftermath and argued that financial strength required for industrial development in Europe was derived from
the wealth taken from colonies in Asia and Africa. At the same time, right-wing historians have countered that India's low economic performance was due to various sectors being in a state of growth and decline due to changes brought in by colonialism
and a world that was moving towards [[industrialisation]] and [[economic integration]].<ref name="roy-1">{{Harvnb|Roy|2006|pp= 22<U+2013>24}}</ref>

In the late 1970s, the government led by [[Morarji Desai]] eased restrictions on capacity expansion for [[Incumbent#In_business|incumbent companies]], removed price controls, reduced corporate taxes and promoted the creation of small scale industries in large numbers. However, the subsequent government policy of [[Fabian socialism]] hampered the benefits of the economy, leading to high fiscal deficits and a worsening current account. The collapse of the Soviet Union, which was India's major trading partner, and the [[Gulf War]], which caused a spike in oil prices, resulted in a major balance-of-payments crisis for India, which found itself facing the prospect of defaulting on its loans.<ref name = "Ghosh">{{Cite web|last=Ghosh|first = Arunabha|title = India's pathway through economic crisis(which makes failer of mixed economy)|publisher= Global Economic Governance Programme|work=GEG Working Paper 2004/06| date=2004-06-01|url=http://www.globaleconomicgovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/Ghosh%20-%20India.pdf|accessdate = 2009-12-12|format=PDF}}</ref> India asked for a $1.8 billion bailout loan from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), which in return demanded reforms.{{sfn|Task Force Report|2006|p=7}}

India's recently liberalised FDI policy (2005) allows up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and foreign direct investment FDI. The upward moving growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100% FDI in the construction sector, including built-up infrastructure and construction development projects comprising housing, commercial premises, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/25/stories/2005022506990100.htm |title=100 per cent FDI in construction industry through automatic route  |newspaper=The Hindu |date=2005-02-25 |author=Sushma Ramachandran |accessdate=2010-12-17}}</ref> Despite a number of changes in the FDI policy to remove caps in most sectors, there still remains an unfinished agenda of permitting greater FDI in politically sensitive areas such as insurance and retailing.
