'''Boffille de Juge''' (died 1502), French-Italian adventurer and statesman, belonged to the family of del Giudice, which came from [[Amalfi]], and followed the fortunes of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|Angevin]] dynasty. When [[John II, Duke of Lorraine|John of Anjou, duke of Calabria]], was conquered in Italy (1461) and fled to Provence, Boffille followed him. He was given by Duke John and his father, [[Ren<U+00E9> I of Naples|King Ren<U+00E9>]], the charge of upholding by force of arms their claims on [[Catalonia]]. 

[[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]], who had joined his troops to those of the princes of [[Anjou]], attached Boffille to his own person, made him his chamberlain and conferred on him the vice-royalty of [[Roussillon]] and [[Cerdanya]] (1471), together with certain important lordships, among others the county of [[Castres]], confiscated from [[James of Armagnac, duke of Nemours]] (1476), and the temporalities of the [[bishopric of Castres]], confiscated from [[John of Armagnac]]. He also entrusted him with diplomatic negotiations with [[Flanders]] and [[England]]. 

In 1480 Boffille married Marie d'Albret, sister of [[Alain I of Albret]] ''le Grand'', thus confirming the feudal position which the king had given him in the south. He was appointed as one of the judges in the trial of [[Ren<U+00E9> of Alen<U+00E7>on]], and showed such zeal in the discharge of his functions that Louis XI rewarded him by fresh gifts. However, the bishop of Castres recovered his [[diocese]] (1483), and the heirs of the duke of Nemours took legal proceedings for the recovery of the county of Castres. 

Boffille, with the object of escaping from his enemies, applied for the command of the armies of the republic of [[Venice]]. His application was refused, and he further lost the viceroyalty of Roussillon (1491). His daughter Louise married against his will a gentleman of no rank, and this led to terrible family dissensions. In order to disinherit his own family, Boffille de Juge gave up the county of Castres to his brother-in-law, Alain d'Albret (1494). He died in 1502.
