It is the second largest city of the canton, after [[Frauenfeld]], with a population of over 18,000.

In 1874, the municipality of Egelshofen was renamed ''Kreuzlingen''. It reached its present size with the incorporation of Kurzrickenbach in 1927 and Emmishofen in 1928.

==Geography==
It is located on [[Lake Constance]] where it narrows to form the ''Untersee'', bordering with [[Konstanz]] in [[Germany]].

It is halfway between [[Schaffhausen]] and [[Rorschach, St. Gallen|Rorschach]] on a slightly southward-dipping west-east axis.

==History==
[[Image:StUlrichinnen.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of St. Ulrich Church]]
The name of the municipality stems from the [[Augustinian]] monastery ''Crucelin'', later [[Kreuzlingen Abbey]]. It was founded in 1125 by the Bishop of Constance Ulrich I. In the [[Swabian War]] and the [[30 Years' War]] after the siege of Constance by [[Sweden|Swedish]] troops, the Augustinian monastery was burned down by the people of Constance, who blamed the monks for having supported the enemy. In 1650, the monastery was rebuilt in its present location. With secularization in 1848, the buildings became a teachers' school. The chapel became a Catholic church

The area was already settled during the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Celt]]ic and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] coins and artifacts testify of continued settlement. Kurzrickenbach is first mentioned as ''Rihinbah'' in 830, Egelshofen as ''Eigolteshoven'' in 1125, and Emmishofen as ''Eminshoven'' in 1159. The territory of the municipality, except for the Augustinian monastery, belonged to the [[Bishop of Constance]]. When the ''Eidgenossen'' conquered Thurgau in 1460 and further with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the ties to the neighboring city loosened.

Until the beginning of the 19th century, the present center of Kreuzlingen was still largely agricultural. The first steamboats began to operate on Lake Constance in 1824. The first train line to [[Romanshorn]] was finished in 1871, and the second to [[Etzwilen]] in 1875. This brought commerce and industry to the region. In 1874, Kreuzlingen became the capital of the district, instead of [[Gottlieben]]. However, until [[World War I]], Kreuzlingen was a kind of suburb of Constance. Most of its industry was in the hands of German firms. The war made Kreuzlingen more independent.

[[Image:Sanatorium bellevue.JPG|thumb|left|Part of the former Sanatorium]]
The Sanatorium of Bellevue (1857<U+2013>1980), which occupied part of the old monastery, played an important role in the history of Kreuzlingen. In 1842, Ignaz Vanotti from Constance bought a large tract of land and built a residential and commercial building in 1843 to house the emigrant press of Bellevue, which had previously been located in [[R<U+00F6>merburg]]. In 1857, Ludwig Binswanger, a psychiatrist from [[M<U+00FC>nsterlingen]] acquired the property and opened a private sanatorium. The clinic was very modern and remained in the control of the Binswanger family for nearly 120 years. Important psychiatric advances, particularly under the founder's grandson, also called [[Ludwig Binswanger]], especially in the development of [[existential psychotherapy]], were made at the sanatorium. However, few of its buildings remain.

==Economy==
Earlier, the majority of the inhabitants made a living in the wine industry. However, because of diseases and bad harvests, the last wine grapes were raised in Kreuzlingen in 1938.

Today, the local economy is largely commercial and manufacturing, with the largest employer being a clothing manufacturer.

==Transportation==
Kreuzlingen is a rail node, and also the northern terminus of the [[A7 (Switzerland)|A7]] motorway in Switzerland.
