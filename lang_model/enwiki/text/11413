The '''Green Corn Rebellion''' was an armed uprising that took place in rural [[Oklahoma]] on August 2 and 3, 1917. The uprising was a reaction by radicalized [[European-American]]s, [[tenant farmers]], [[Seminole]]s, [[Muscogee Creek]]s and [[African-American]]s to an attempt to enforce the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Draft Act of 1917]]<ref>Chang 187</ref> and was so-called due to the purported plans of the rebels to march across the country, eating "green corn" on the way for sustenance.<ref name=SellarsGCR>Sellars, Nigel Anthony. [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/G/GR022.html "Green Corn Rebellion."] ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' Accessed 1 Sept 2011</ref> Betrayed by an [[informer]] in their midst, the country rebels met with a well-armed [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of townsmen, with whom shots were exchanged and three people killed. In the aftermath of the incident, scores of arrests were made and the [[Socialist Party of America]], formerly strong in the region was decimated in the public eye for allegedly having attempted to foment revolution. The incident was also used as a pretext for national reprisals against the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].

==History==
===Background===
[[File:U.S._draft_lottery.jpg|thumb|200px|Secretary of War Newton Baker draws the first number of the lottery created by the 1917 Selective Draft Act.]]

On April 6, 1917, President [[Woodrow Wilson]], recently sworn into a second term of office for which he had run behind the slogan "He Kept Us Out of War," appeared between a joint session of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to ask for a [[declaration of war]] against [[Imperial Germany]]. Congress readily obliged the President's request, [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|voting to declare war on Germany]] by a margin of 373-50 in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and 82-6 in the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref>Francis Wickware (ed.), ''The American Year Book: 1918.'' Volume 8. New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1918; pg. 10.</ref>

This decision of the United States government to enter [[World War I]] was backed up with additional legislation imposing [[military conscription]] in America to staff the nation's wartime Army and Navy. On May 18, 1917, a [[selective service|draft]] bill became law.<ref name=P&F23>H.C. Peterson and Gilbert C. Fite, ''Opponents of War, 1917-1918.'' Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1957; pg. 23.</ref> The bill called for all eligible young men nationwide to register for the draft on a single day <U+2014> June 5, 1917.<ref name=P&F24>Peterson and Fite, ''Opponents of War,'' pg. 24.</ref> While isolated hotspots of anti-conscription activity sprung up in some urban centers,<ref name=P&F23 /> the registration process was generally an orderly affair, with the vast majority of young American men accepting their fate with what has been characterized as "a calm resignation."<ref name=P&F24 />

On July 20, 1917, a blindfolded [[Newton D. Baker]], the Wilson administration's [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], drew numbers choosing certain registered young men for mandatory military service. Opponents of American participation in the war continued their efforts to change the country's course, holding meetings and distributing [[pamphlets]].<ref name=P&F31>Peterson and Fite, ''Opponents of War,'' pg. 31.</ref> Among the leading organized forces in opposition to conscription and the war was the [[Socialist Party of America]], which at its April 1917 National Convention had declared its "unalterable opposition" to the war and urged the workers of the world to "refuse support to the governments in their wars."<ref>David A. Shannon, ''The Socialist Party of America: A History.'' New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 95.</ref>

===The situation in Oklahoma===
Although it was a young state, admitted into the union only in November 1907, there was already a strong radical tradition in Oklahoma, in which the impoverished [[tenant farmer|tenant farmers]] of the southeastern part of the state seized upon the millenarian fervor of the early Socialist Party in an attempt to improve their lives.<ref>Garin Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red: The Gospel of Socialism in the Oklahoma Countryside, 1910-1924.</ref> In the 1916 election, despite Woodrow Wilson's siphoning off a portion of the anti-war vote for the Democratic ticket, the Socialist Party garnered more than a quarter of the votes cast in the 1916 election in [[Seminole County, Oklahoma|Seminole County]] and 22% in neighboring [[Pontotoc County, Oklahoma|Pontotoc County]].<ref>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 303.</ref> 

Nor was the Socialist Party the only active organizers in the area <U+2014> in 1916 a radical tenant farmers' organization called the "Working Class Union (WCU)" claimed a membership of as much as 20,000 in Eastern Oklahoma alone.<ref name=White>Bertha Hale White, [http://www.marxisthistory.org/history/usa/parties/spusa/1922/0304-white-greencornreb.pdf "The Green Corn Rebellion in Oklahoma,"] ''The New Day'' [Milwaukee], v. 4, no. 9, whole no. 91 (March 4, 1922), pg. 68.</ref> The group's [[ideology]] blended what one historian has called "a muddled [[industrial unionism]] with traditional southern forms of countervigilantism, self-defense, and opposition to conscription" and arose as a complement to the radical [[syndicalism]] of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] <U+2014> an organization which did not seek to organize tenant farmers.<ref name=NAS78>Sellars (1998) ''Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies,'' pg. 78.</ref>

Tenant farmers were predominantly young <U+2014> the age group most impacted by conscription. Some 76% of Oklahoma farmers under age 24 rented their land, while 45% of those between the ages of 25 and 33 found themselves tenants.<ref name=NAS80>Sellars (1998) ''Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies,'' pg. 80.</ref> Most tenant farmers were white<ref name=NAS80 /> and African-American.<ref>Sellars (2002), ''Treasonous Tenant Farmers," pp. 2-3</ref> Many of these young "dirt farmers" found their economic prospects hopeless, squeezed between a usurious credit system practiced by stores and substantial crop liens inflicted by landlords.<ref name=NAS80 /> The depleted condition of Oklahoma's land forced the input of twice as much labor as the share-croppers of [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]] to generate comparable yields.<ref name=NAS80 /> Disaffection was rife and proposals for radical solutions found ready ears.<ref name=NAS80 />

Despite the WCU's highly questionable membership claims, ballooning to 35,000 for the whole state of Oklahoma,<ref name=SellarsGCR/> the group had by 1917 clearly established a solid foothold among the tenant farmers of Oklahoma. The organization was not a tame one, taking the form of [[secret society]], with activities which included [[night riding]] and the use of physical violence against its opponents.<ref name=Burbank135>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 135.</ref>

Hostilities between the radical rural supporters of the WCU and the conservative forces of the towns of the region ran high, with [[dynamite]] used against cattle dipping-vats late in 1915 in protest of a mandatory use of costly [[insecticide]] that some felt was as lethal to dipped cattle as to the [[tick|ticks]] and other parasites they carried.<ref name=Burbank136>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 136.</ref> The controversy was punctuated by a shotgun blast fired through the window of the Pontotoc County Attorney early in 1916.<ref name=Burbank140>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 140.</ref> Conservative voices declared the action to be an act of political terrorism, while radicals charged the shot to be a provocation, "part of a concocted plan on the part of the officials and two or three newspapers to wreck the Socialist Party by pulling off a fake attempted assassination."<ref name=Burbank140 />

Town dwellers, who had been subject to perennial attacks as "robbers, thieves, and grafters" by radical public speakers, were thoroughly convinced that the Socialists and the secret WCU were part of a single radical conspiracy to launch a long-desired revolution in their own locale.<ref name=Burbank140 />

The Muscogee Creek Nation at time of the rebellion was controlled by only 61 mixed blood Creek and intermarried white individuals.<ref>Sellars (2002), ''Treasonous Tenant Farmers," p. 13 (1108)</ref> August 3rd marked the end of the Muscogee Creek [[Green Corn Ceremony]].<ref name=jh224>Joyce and Harris, 224</ref>

In early August 1917, preceding the rebellion, large numbers of African-American, European-American, and Native American men gathered at the farm of John Spears in [[Sasakwa, Oklahoma|Sasakwa]] to plan a march upon Washington, DC to end the war.<ref name=SellarsGCR/><ref>Sellars (2002), ''Treasonous Tenant Farmers'', p. 3</ref>

===The rebellion===
[[File:Little River OK.jpg|thumb|200px|The Little River, near [[Sasakwa, Oklahoma]], the site of an ambush of a Seminole County sheriff and deputy.]]

The so-called Green Corn Rebellion may be said to have started on Thursday, August 2, 1917, when a Seminole County sheriff and his deputy were ambushed near the [[Little River (Oklahoma)|Little River]], a tributary of the Canadian river.<ref name=NAS77>Sellars (1998), ''Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies,'' pg. 77.</ref> Raiding parties followed this action, cutting telephone lines and burning railroad bridges.<ref name=NAS77 /> 

On Friday, August 3, exactly two weeks after the draft lottery in Washington, D.C., an armed gathering assembled near the adjoining borders of Pontotoc, Seminole, and Hughes counties in Southeastern Oklahoma.<ref name=Burbank144>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 144.</ref> The uprising seems to have been spurred by the agitation of the Working Class Union, which was reported in one newspaper as having called its supporters to arms with a manifesto which declared:

<blockquote>
"Now is the time to rebel against this war with Germany, boys. Boys, get together and don't go. Rich man's war. Poor man's fight. The war is over with Germany if you don't go and [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] is lost. Their great speculation is the only cause of the war."<ref>''Harlow's Weekly,'' August 15, 1917. Quoted in Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 145.</ref></blockquote>

Unfortunately, no documents written by WCU members have survived and the mentality of those taking up arms must be considered speculative.<ref name=Burbank145>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 145.</ref> Still, historians do speculate. Historian Garin Burbank argues that the coming of conscription threatened to decimate family economies by removing able-bodied young men needed to harvest cotton.<ref name=Burbank146>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 146.</ref> Moreover, Burbank argues, Socialist ideas had found its mark in Oklahoma, with many poor farmers earnestly believing from their experiences in daily life in the reality of "exploitation" and accepting the notion that the European war was little more than capitalist business enterprise writ large.<ref name=Burbank145 />

The country folk, in short, saw military conscription as an invasion of their rights, and they rebelled in an attempt to keep the government from taking away their sons.<ref>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pp. 144-145.</ref>

Arming themselves, an estimated 800 to 1000 rebels, "the vast majority of old American stock," met on the banks of the [[South Canadian River]] and made plans to head East, living off the land as they marched.<ref>The words and estimate for the number of participants are those of James Weinstein, ''The Decline of American Socialism, 1912-1925.'' New York: Monthly Review Press, 1967; pg. 139. Other estimates are lower.</ref> They would eat roasted "green corn" and barbecued beef on the way, so it was later said, eventually joining up with countless thousands of likeminded comrades who would together march on Washington, DC where they would overthrow "Big Slick" Woodrow Wilson, repeal the draft act, and end the war.<ref name=Burbank134>Burbank, ''When Farmers Voted Red,'' pg. 134.</ref>

These plans, if such a whimsical scheme may be called such, were instantly betrayed to local authorities by an informer.<ref name=Burbank134 /> A [[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse]] of townsmen was formed and headed to the river banks to meet the ostensible revolutionaries. The so-called rebellion proved anti-climactic, as historian Garin Burbank notes:

<blockquote>
"Catching sight of the advancing townsmen, the country people fired a few desultory shots and fled in disorder. This was the pathetic end of their overt resistance to the incursions of outside political authority."<ref name=Burbank134 /></blockquote>

The incident was over within a few hours and mass arrests of participants were begun.<ref name=NAS90>Sellars, ''Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies,'' pg. 90.</ref>

===Aftermath and legacy===
[[File:Canadian River Calvin Oklahoma.jpg|thumb|200px|The Canadian River in Southeastern Oklahoma, not far from the location of the abortive Green Corn Rebellion.]]

A total of three people were killed in the Green Corn Rebellion of August 1917,<ref name=SellarsGCR/>
<ref name=NAS90 /> one of whom was Clifford Clark, an African American tenant farmer.<ref>Chang 186</ref> Nearly 450 people were detained in connection with the incident, of whom 266 were released without charges being filed.<ref name=NAS90 /> Charges were levied against 184 participants, of whom about 150 were convicted or pled guilty, receiving jail and prison terms ranging from 60 days to ten years.<ref>Sellars (1998) ''Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies,'' pp. 90-91.</ref> Those identified as leaders of the uprising received the heaviest sentences.<ref name=NAS91>Sellars, ''Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies,'' pg. 91.</ref>

While most were paroled or pardoned after a short period, five men remained in the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Federal prison]] in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], in February 1922.

The so-called "rebellion" was used as a cudgel against the [[Socialist Party of Oklahoma]], with the party being blamed for the incident despite its largely spontaneous and external origins.<ref name=SellarsGCR /> This was one in a series of events that undermined the American socialist movement and fueled the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]].<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CO040.html "Communist Party."] ''Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' Accessed September 1, 2011.</ref>

The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] shared the brunt of popular indignation, despite the fact that the organization took no part in the Green Corn Rebellion and was related to the WCU only by virtue of the latter group having formed in response to the IWW's refusal to organize tenant farmers.<ref name=NAS78 /> The IWW was still blamed for every action of the WCU, however, and the bogey Green Corn Rebellion was ultimately used as a justification for further measures against the IWW nationally.<ref>Sellars, ''Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies,'' pp. 78-79.</ref>

An elderly Seminole-Muscogee Creek woman relayed to [[Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz]] that her uncle had been imprisoned after the rebellion. She is quoted, "The full moon of late July, early August it was, the Moon of the Green Corn. It was not easy to persuade our poor white and black brothers and sisters to rise up. We told them that rising up, standing up, whatever the consequences, would inspire future generations. Our courage, our bravery would be remembered and copied. That has been the Indian way for centuries, since the invasions. Fight and tell the story so that those who come after or their descendants will rise up once again. It may take a thousand years, but that is how we continue and eventually prevail."<ref name=jh224/>

A fictionalized account of the abortive revolt can be found in William Cunningham<U+2019>s novel, ''The Green Corn Rebellion,'' published by [[Vanguard Press]] in 1935. The novel was republished by [[University of Oklahoma Press]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/green-corn-rebellion-a-novel/oclc/427704506 ''The Green Corn Rebellion: A Novel,''] by William Cunningham. Norman,OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2010. OCLC no. 427704506.</ref>

[[Sam Marcy]], founder of [[Workers World Party]] upheld the Green Corn Rebellion as the ideal working class, anti-war struggle in his book "The Bolsheviks and War" published in 1985.<ref>Marcy, Sam.
