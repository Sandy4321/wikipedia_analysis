'''Fort Senneville''' is one of the outlying forts of [[Montreal|Montr<U+00E9>al]], [[Quebec|Qu<U+00E9>bec]], built by the [[Canada, New France|Canadiens]] of [[New France]] near the [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne rapids]] in 1671. 

The property was part of a [[fief]] ceded to Dugu<U+00E9> de Boisbriant in 1672 by the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Sulpicians]]. A large stone [[windmill]], which doubled as a [[watch tower]], was built on a hill by late 1686 and featuring [[machicolation]] and other [[castle]]-like features. The fort was burned down by [[Iroquois]] in 1691, with only the mill itself left standing.

Governor-General [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac|Frontenac]] ordered the construction of a second, more imposing fort in 1692. It was rebuilt in 1702-03 to protect the nearby fur trading post. With extensive [[cannon]]s and swiveling wall guns, it was the "most substantial castle-like fort" near Montr<U+00E9>al.<ref name="Chartrand38">Chartrand, p. 38</ref> It was eventually destroyed in 1776 by [[Benedict Arnold]], while under British rule, but the ruins have been maintained since then. In 2003, it was classified as a [[National historic site|historic site]].

==Background==
Thanks to the tireless work of French explorers, the colony of New France covered the largest area, but it was numerically inferior to the neighbouring [[New England]]. Consequently, a number of [[Military engineer|Ing<U+00E9>nieur du Roi]] were appointed to make the colony the best fortified in North America:<ref name="Chartrand4">Chartrand, p. 4</ref>

Qu<U+00E9>bec served as the only fortified city in the Americas, centred around the [[Citadelle of Quebec|Citadelle of Qu<U+00E9>bec]]. An unusual feature of [[Montreal|Montr<U+00E9>al]]'s defence was a string of 30 outlying forts to protect against the constant Iroquois threat to the expansion of French settlements.<ref name="Chartrand37">Chartrand, p. 37</ref> The majority of these were simple stockades, but as artillery was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of these were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Roughly four of these were substantial stone forts which served as defensive residences, sometimes considered "true castles", as well as imposing structures to prevent [[Iroquois]] incursions.<ref name="Chartrand37"/><ref name="Chartrand41"/> Initially, Fort Senneville was a French stockaded fort, built in 1671 about half a mile above the [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne rapids]].<ref name="QForts">[http://www.geocities.com/naforts/qc.html Qu<U+00E9>bec's Forts]</ref><ref name="Chartrand41">Chartrand, p. 41</ref> The property was part of a fief ceded to Dugu<U+00E9> de Boisbriant in 1672 by the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|S<U+00E9>minaire de Saint-Sulpice]], and subsequently relinquished in payment of a debt to two of the most significant figures in New France's history: Jacques Le Ber and Charles Le Moyne, who used the site as a fur-trading post.<ref name="heritage">[http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/ocpm/pdf/PD04/10f.pdf Cultural and Natural Heritage of the site]</ref>

A large stone windmill was built on a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the [[Ottawa River]], the Lake of Two Mountains and the mouth of the Des Prairies River.<ref name="Chartrand41"/> This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Qu<U+00E9>bec), with thick walls, square loopholes for [[musket]]s, with [[machicolation]] at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.<ref name="Chartrand41"/>

In October 1687, the nearby [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Fort Sainte-Anne]] and the Senneville mill were attacked by Iroquois, and although several settlers were killed, the enemy was beaten off.<ref name="Chartrand41"/> A second attack was more successful in 1691, and the fort was burned down. Only the mill itself was left standing.<ref name="Chartrand41"/>

==Second Fort==
[[Image:Benedict arnold 1776.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colonel]] [[Benedict Arnold]] in [[1776]], the year he destroyed the fort.]]
The attack had come shortly after the [[Battle of Quebec (1690)|1690 Battle of Qu<U+00E9>bec]], and an enraged Governor-General [[Frontenac]] ordered the construction of a second, more imposing fort.<ref name="Chartrand41"/> The fort was rebuilt in 1692 with thick stone walls and corner tower [[bastion]]s.<ref name="QForts"/> With extensive cannons and swivel wall guns, it was the "most substantial castle-like fort" near Montr<U+00E9>al.<ref name="Chartrand38">Chartrand, p. 38</ref>

It was never attacked again. The windmill was rebuilt in 1700, and was probably still in use until the 1780's.<ref name="QForts"/> In 1703, Jacques LeBer de Senneville constructed a large stone house and fort in order to improve and protect the fur-trading operations,<ref name="heritage"/> and the local seigneural manor house was built in 1706.<ref name="QForts"/> However, after the fall of New France in 1763, it was not used by the British as a military post. In 1776, Fort Senneville was destroyed by [[American Revolutionary War|American troops]] under [[Benedict Arnold]], as they retreated south after the [[Battle of the Cedars]].<ref name="QForts"/>

In 1865, the property was purchased as a summer residence by John Joseph Caldwell Abbott, former prime minister of Canada and Mayor of Montr<U+00E9>al. Sir Edward Seabourne Clouston purchased the domain from Abbott's estate in 1898.

==The site today==
It presently belongs to four great-grandchildren of Sir Edward Clouston - first general director of the Bank of Montr<U+00E9>al.<ref name="heritage"/> The ruins of the fort have been maintained by the Clouston, Todd, and Hackney families. The owners have allowed visitors to the location, although the site itself remains private property.<ref name="heritage"/> The ten-acre area today is important part to Montr<U+00E9>al's cultural and natural heritage for several reasons.<ref name="heritage"/>

In November 2003, the province of Qu<U+00E9>bec Minister of Culture and Communications Line Beauchamp recognized its historical significance by classifying it a "''[[National historic site#Canada|Site historique]]''".<ref name="heritage"/> The Ministery of Culture and Communications has commissioned studies on the historical ownership of the fort, and funded archaeological research and repairs to consolidate the structure of the ruin, recognising "the exceptional historic and prehistoric archaeological potential of the ruin and its surroundings".<ref name="heritage"/>

The site's value today includes its ecological and environmental significance, and its shoreline, which is in a semi-natural state, is part of the [[habitat]] for the rare [[map turtle]].<ref name="heritage"/> It is situated between the Lake of Two Mountains and the Senneville Forest ecoterritory, as described in Montr<U+00E9>al's Natural Spaces Policy. Therefore, it could be considered part of the wildlife corridor (''lien faunique'') between the lake and the Forest.
