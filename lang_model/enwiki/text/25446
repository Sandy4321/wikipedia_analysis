The '''winghead shark''' (''Eusphyra blochii'') is a [[species]] of [[hammerhead shark]], family [[Sphyrnidae]], named for the remarkably wide lobes on its head. It is the sole species in the genus ''Eusphyra''. A small and harmless species, the winghead shark is commercially fished throughout much of its range.

==Taxonomy==
[[Georges Cuvier]] first described a specimen of the winghead shark in [[1817]], as a footnote to his account of ''Squalus zygaena'' (=''Sphyrna zygaena'', the [[smooth hammerhead]]). Although his citation was not a proper [[binomial name]], Valenciennes interpreted it as ''Zygaena Blochii nobis'' when he described and illustrated the winghead shark in detail in [[1822]].<ref name="compagno">Compagno, Leonard J. V. (1984) ''Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date''. [[Rome]]: [[Food and Agricultural Organization]]. ISBN 9251013845.</ref> Compagno (1979, 1988) elevated the winghead shark to its own genus, ''Eusphyra'', although this was disputed by Dingerkus (1986) on the grounds that it made the genus ''[[Sphyrna]]'' [[paraphyletic]]. Since then, the winghead shark has been listed under its own genus or as a subgenus of ''Sphyrna'' in various sources.<ref name="martin"/>

A [[phylogenetic]] analysis based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] by Martin (1993) showed that, contrary to the traditional (and intuitive) interpretation that the hammerheads with small "hammers" (such as the [[bonnethead]]) represented intermediate forms between the [[requiem shark]]s and those species with larger "hammers", the winghead shark was in fact the earliest of the hammerheads to diverge from their [[carcharhinidae|carcharhinid]] ancestors. This suggests that the large hammer appeared suddenly in [[evolution]]ary history, and was later modified in the other species.<ref name="martin">Martin, R. Aidan. (February 24, 1998).

==Distribution and habitat==
The winghead shark is found in shallow water on the [[continental shelf|continental]] and insular shelves of the [[Western Indo-Pacific|Indo-West Pacific]], from the [[Persian Gulf]] to the [[Philippines]], north to [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], and south to [[Queensland]] and the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]].<ref name="compagno"/> It sometimes enters the [[brackish water]] of [[estuaries]].<ref name="fishbase">{{FishBase_species| genus = Eusphyra | species = blochii | month = May | year = 2006}}</ref>

==Description==
The extremely long and narrow lateral head blades of the winghead shark, called a "cephalofoil", distinguishes this shark from all other species. The width of the cephalofoil is 40-50% the body length; it is wing or arrow-shaped from above, with small bumps in front of the [[nostril]]s. Unlike in ''Sphyrna'', the nostrils are placed closer to the center of the cephalofoil than the ends, and have enormous lateral extensions that reach almost to the eyes. Its coloration is grey or grey-brown above, paler below.<ref name="compagno"/> This is a small shark, not more than 1.86 m long.<ref name="fishbase"/>

==Biology and ecology==
The cephalofoil of the winghead shark is so large as to be almost unwieldy, while the placement of the nostrils and the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] are wider than in non-hammerhead sharks (albeit more medial than in other hammerhead sharks). Along with its basal position in hammerhead phylogeny, this lends support to the idea that this structure originally evolved for a sensory, rather than hydrodynamic, function.<ref name="martin"/> The winghead shark feeds mainly on small [[teleost]] fishes, but also takes [[crustacean]]s and [[cephalopod]]s.<ref name="fishbase"/>

Like other hammerhead sharks, the winghead shark is [[viviparous]] with the [[embryo]]s nourished by a [[yolk sac]] [[placenta]]. Off [[Bombay]], the young are birthed just before the [[monsoon]] season in April and May and mating takes place during the monsoon from June to August, suggesting a [[gestation period]] of eight months.<ref name="compagno"/> Off [[Australia]], the females give birth in February and March, after a gestation period of 10-11 months.<ref name="stevens and lyle">{{cite journal |author=Stevens, J.D. and Lyle, J.M. |title=Biology of three hammerhead sharks (''Eusphyra blochii'', ''Sphyrna mokarran'' and ''S. lewini'') from Northern Australia |journal=Australian Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=129<U+2013>146 |date=1989 |accessdate=2008-10-19 |doi=10.1071/MF9890129}}</ref> Litters number 6 to 25 pups,<ref name="fishbase"/> with the young measuring 32-45 cm at birth.<ref name="compagno"/> Females reproduce every year.<ref name="stevens and lyle"/> Maturation occurs at around 110 cm.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Human interactions==
The winghead shark is probably harmless to humans. It is a common [[fisheries]] species in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]], and probably also in other parts of its range. It is caught with floating [[gillnet]]s, fixed bottom gill nets, stake nets, [[seine]]s, with floating and bottom [[longline fishing|longlines]], and probably on hook-and-line.<ref name="compagno"/> It is particularly common in catches off [[Kalimantan]],<ref name="fishbase"/> and comprise a small part of Australian commercial catches.<ref name="iucn"/> The meat is used for human consumption, the [[liver]] is a source of high-potency [[vitamin]] [[oil]], and the [[offal]] is probably used for [[fishmeal]].<ref name="compagno"/> There is no scientific data on its population status, though anecdotal accounts and market surveys suggest that it has likely declined in most of its range except Australia.<ref name="iucn"/>
