{{1922 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''1922 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[1922 college football season]]. In [[Fielding H. Yost]]'s 22nd season as head coach, Michigan compiled a record of 6<U+2013>0<U+2013>1 (4<U+2013>0 in [[Big Ten Conference]] games), outscored opponents 183<U+2013>13, and tied with [[1922 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] for the Big Ten championship.  On defense, the team did not allow its opponents to score a point in the first five games of the season, and its scoring defense of 1.8 points per game is among the lowest in Michigan football history.

Highlights of the 1922 season included participation in dedication games for [[Vanderbilt University]]'s [[Vanderbilt Stadium|Dudley Field]], the first large athletic stadium in the South, and [[Ohio State University]]'s [[Ohio Stadium]].  At the dedication game for Ohio Stadium, the Wolverines shut out the Buckeyes, 19<U+2013>0.

Halfback [[Harry G. Kipke|Harry Kipke]] led the team in scoring with 48 points in six games, handled punting responsibilities, and was also one of the team's best defensive players.  Kipke was a consensus [[1922 College Football All-America Team|All-American]], receiving first-team honors from [[Walter Camp]], ''Athletic World'', [[Walter Eckersall]], [[Norman E. Brown]], and Lawrence Perry.  Team captain and right end [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]] was also selected as a first-team All-American by ''Athletic World'' magazine based on polling of 250 coaches.  Left end [[Bernard Kirk]], who received first-team All-American honors from Eckersall, died of meningitis in December 1922 after sustaining a brain injury in an automobile crash.

==Season summary==
===Pre-season===
[[File:Fielding Yost 1915.png|thumb|right|135px|[[Fielding H. Yost]]]]
Months before the start of the 1922 season, reports circulated that [[Fielding H. Yost]] intended to resign as Michigan's head football coach.  He had served in that capacity since 1901 and had taken on additional responsibilities as the university's athletic director in 1921.  In late February 1922, Yost spoke publicly to deny the accuracy of the reports.  He added, "I have just begun my real work at Michigan, and I am not considering resigning."<ref>{{cite news|title=Yost Emphatically Denies That He Intends to Resign|date=February 28, 1922|url=}}</ref>

The months before the 1922 football season also brought change to athletic administration in the [[Big Ten Conference]].  The member schools created a new position for a commissioner of athletics to oversee rules compliance at all the member schools.  [[John L. Griffith]] was appointed as the first commissioner in the summer of 1922.  In August 1922, Yost, who was a member of the committee that chose Griffith, spoke publicly to reject suggestions that Griffith's appointment should be perceived as an indication that there were compliance problems that needed to be corrected.  Rather, Yost described the appointment as a "progressive move" toward solving future problems.  Yost noted, "At least ninety-five percent of the men are good, perhaps five percent are bad, yet we hear more about the five percent who go wrong than the much greater number who play the game on the square."<ref>{{cite news|title=Yost Sets 'Em Right: Says Conference Guide Wasn't Appointed Because of Crookedness|newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World|date=August 26, 1922|url=}}</ref>

Several key players from the [[1921 Michigan Wolverines football team|1921 team]] were lost to graduation.   These include halfback [[Eddie Usher]], who went on to pay for the [[Green Bay Packers]] in 1922, and fullback [[Frank Steketee]], who had been a first-team All-American as a freshman in 1918. Despite the loss of Usher and Steketee, the 1922 backfield was promising with [[Irwin Uteritz]], [[Harry G. Kipke|Harry Kipke]], [[Franklin Cappon]], and [[Doug Roby]] all returning from the 1921 team.  Michigan's biggest weakness going into the 1922 season was the center of its line.  All-American center [[Ernie Vick]] graduated and joined the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] baseball team in June 1922.<ref name=BR>{{cite news|title=Ernie Vick profile|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/v/vicker01.shtml}}</ref>  Also gone were starting right guard, Hugh Wilson, and starting left guard, [[Robert J. Dunne|"Duke" Dunne]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Teams Lose Many By Graduation: Track Hardest Hit as Eleven Men Get Degrees -- Six Football Stars Depart|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 6, 1932|url=}}</ref>  The 1923 ''Michiganensian'' summed up the challenges facing the 1922 team, "When the football season of 1922 opened, Coach Yost was confronted with two big problems, to build a line strong enough to withstand the onslaught of opposing backs and to beat Ohio State."<ref>1923 Michiganensian, "Review of the Season," p. 221.</ref>

Michigan opened the season on October 7, 1922, with a 48<U+2013>0 victory over the "Scientists" from [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Scientific School]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Crushes Case: Is Held Scoreless During First Quarter and Then Triumphs 48 to 0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 8, 1922|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B07E5DE1139E133A2575BC0A9669D946395D6CF&scp=3&sq=case&st=p}}</ref>  (Michigan opened its season with a home game against Case 16 times between 1902 and 1923.)  Facing an easy opponent in Case, head coach [[Fielding H. Yost]] opted to spend the day watching the Ohio State game in [[Columbus, Ohio]].  Yost was accompanied in Columbus by team captain [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]] and starting quarterback [[Irwin Uteritz]].  Two of Yost's assistants also spent the day on scouting missions, with [[George Little (American football coach)|George Little]] watching the Michigan Aggies and [[A. J. Sturzenegger]] watching Vanderbilt.  Second-year assistant [[Elton Wieman]] was left in Ann Arbor as the game-day coach against Case.<ref name=DFPC/>

The game was played in drizzling rain with a ball that was described as being "as slippery as the well-known greased pig."<ref name=DFPC/>  The first quarter was scoreless, as Michigan played defensive football, punting on first and second downs.  [[Harry G. Kipke|Harry Kipke]] attempted a drop-kick for a field goal late in the first quarter, but the kick was short.  In the second quarter, Kipke ran 26 yards around right end for the first touchdown.  On the next drive, [[Doug Roby]] scored Michigan's second touchdown on a 37-yard run, "arming off three tacklers and outrunning three others."<ref name=DFPC/>  Michigan's next possession began with a 43-yard kickoff return by Kipke and ended with a 15-yard touchdown run by Roby around the right end.  [[Ray Knode]] drop-kicked all three extra points in the first half, and Michigan led at halftime, 21<U+2013>0.<ref name=DFPC/>

On Michigan's first play from scrimmage in the second half, [[Herb Steger]] took the ball at midfield and ran the length of the field for a touchdown.  The ''Detroit Free Press'' described Steger "cleverly dodging, twisting, and straight arming" through half of the Case team and called it "the most sensational run of the contest."<ref name=DFPC>{{cite news|author=Lloyd Northard|title=Michigan Swamps Case Eleven Beneath 48-0 Score In Opener: Yostmen Gain 21-Point Lead in First Half; Kipke Records First Touchdown of Season by Specatcular 26-Yard Sprint|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|page=17|date=October 18, 1922|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/freep/access/1873174722.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Oct+8%2C+1922&author=LLOYD+NORTHARD&pub=Detroit+Free+Press+(1858-1922)&edition=&startpage=17&desc=Michigan+Swamps+Case+Eleven+Beneath+48-0+Score+In+Opener}}</ref>  Steger place-kicked for the extra point after his touchdown.  Later in the third period, [[Franklin Cappon]] intercepted a pass (his second interception in the quarter) and returned it 47 yards for a touchdown.  Knode missed the extra point, and Michigan led, 34-0, at the end of the third quarter.<ref name=DFPC/>

In the fourth quarter, Michigan scored twice.  The Wolverines' sixth touchdown came on a 30-yard run through left tackle by Kipke, and the final touchdown was scored by Roby on a 12-yard run around right end.  Knode kicked both of the extra points in the fourth quarter. Playing with an inexperienced line, Michigan was penalized several times for offside and holding.  Despite the penalties, the ''Detroit Free Press'' praised Ed VanDerVoort for opening holes on offense and being immovable on defense, [[Jack Blott]], who was "always under the plays" on defense, and [[James Edward Johns|Eddie Johns]], who played with only one day's practice.<ref name=DFPC/>  Michigan's 48 points were scored by Roby (18), Kipke (12), Steger (7), Cappon (6), and Knode (5).

Michigan's starting lineup against Wisconsin was Kirk (left end), Blahnick (left tackle), Rosatti (left guard), Blott (center), Johns (right guard), VanDervoort (right tackle), Neisch (right end), Knode (quarterback), Roby (left halfback), Kipke (right halfback), and Cappon (fullback).<ref name=DFPC/>

For the second game of the season, Michigan traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to play Vanderbilt.  The game matched Michigan head coach [[Fielding H. Yost]] against his former player and brother-in-law [[Dan McGugin]].  Owing to the familial relationship between Yost and McGugin, the two teams played each other nine times between 1905 and 1923.  The 1922 game was also the official dedication game for Vanderbilt's new stadium [[Vanderbilt Stadium|Dudley Field]], the first large athletic stadium in the South.<ref name=DFPV/><ref name=NYTV>{{cite news|title=Vanderbilt Christens Stadium By Tying Michigan, 0 to 0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 15, 1922|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F0CE3DB1139E133A25756C1A9669D946395D6CF}}</ref>

Vanderbilt under McGugin was one of the first great Southern football teams, putting together consecutive undefeated seasons in 1921 and 1922.  During those years, the Commodores shut out the leading football teams in the South, including Alabama in 1921 (14<U+2013>0), Texas in 1921 (20<U+2013>0), Tennessee in 1921 (14<U+2013>0), Georgia in 1922 (12<U+2013>0), Kentucky in 1922 (9<U+2013>0), and Sewanee twice (9<U+2013>0 and 26<U+2013>0).<ref>{{cite web|title=Vanderbilt Yearly Results (1920<U+2013>1924)|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/vanderbilt/yearly_results.php?year=1920}}</ref>

Michigan's starting lineup against Vanderbilt was Kirk (left end), Muirhead (left tackle), Blott (left guard), Slaughter (center), Steele (right guard), VanDervoort (right tackle), Goebel (right end), Uteritz (quarterback), Kipke (left halfback), Roby (right halfback), and Cappon (fullback).<ref name=DFPV>{{cite news|author=[[Sam Greene|Sam S.

After the scoreless tie with Vanderbilt, Michigan traveled to [[Columbus, Ohio]], and for the second week in a row participated in the dedication ceremonies for a new football stadium <U+2013> [[Ohio Stadium]].  Interest in the game was intensified due to the opening of the new stadium and because Ohio State had beaten Michigan three years in a row <U+2013> the Buckeyes' longest winning streak in the [[Michigan<U+2013>Ohio State football rivalry]] up to that time.  The animosity was also fueled by rumors that Ohio State officials had triggered a Big Ten investigation into the eligibility of Michigan halfback, [[Doug Roby]].<ref name=NYTOSU/>

More than two weeks before the game, Fielding Yost placed an order for an additional 5,000 seats for Michigan supporters, supplementing 10,000 seats that had already been allotted to Michigan.<ref>{{cite news|title=May Have Seats for 73,000 At Michigan - Ohio State Game|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 7, 1922|url=}}</ref>  A total of 16,000 Michigan supporters attended the game, shrinking Ann Arbor's population to less than half of its normal size.<ref name=OAP/><ref name=APOSU>{{cite news|title=Kipke Is Bright Star As Michigan Slaughters Ohio: Scores Two Touchdowns and a Field Goal for the Wolverine Cause|newspaper=Owosso Argus-Press (AP story)|date=October 23, 1922|url=}}</ref>  Some traveled on [[Pullman (car or coach)|Pullman car]]s pulled by special trains, and others traveled by automobile.  One newspaper reported on the exodus as follows:<blockquote>"Automobile parties will start from Ann Arbor on Friday and will form a steady parade between here and Columbus.

Michigan won, 19<U+2013>0, in a game that ''The New York Times'' wrote had "crowned the greatest day in mid Western football history."<ref name=NYTOSU/>  [[Harry G. Kipke|Harry Kipke]] and [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]] were the stars of the game, scoring all 19 points for Michigan -- two touchdowns and a field goal by Kipke and a field goal and an extra point by Goebel.  Both also played important roles in smothering Ohio State's vaunted passing game.  Ohio State attempted 20 passes, 10 of which were incomplete and three of which were intercepted.  Kipke intercepted  two passes, and his first touchdown came on a 45-yard interception return.  ''The New York Times'' wrote that "[t]he fleet, agile Kipke intercepted passes and tore through Ohio's scattered defense for long gains."<ref name=NYTOSU/>  Dick Meade, sports editor of ''[[The Toledo News-Bee]]'', wrote that Yost had "his great ace in the hole, the brilliant Kipke, who booted for distance and accuracy, who ran like the wind and who was a marvel of efficiency in sensing pass plays and breaking them up."<ref name=Meade/>
[[File:Paul Goebel.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Team captain [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]]]]
Goebel played in the game with an injured knee and wore a fitted steel hinge <U+2013> an early version of a knee brace.  "Before each game, Goebel liberally oiled the hinge to get free action," but his playing time was limited because "the constant action would dry the oil and then the steel would become so hot that Goebel could not continue playing."<ref name=Hinge>{{cite news|title=Knee Brace Lacks Oil; Player Quits|publisher=Modesto Evening News|date=December 12, 1922}}</ref>  Despite the limitations of the knee brace, Goebel blocked a punt in the first quarter and then kicked a long field goal from the 30-yard line for the game's first points. He also penetrated into the Ohio State backfield in the second quarter to recover a fumble.<ref name=Evans>{{cite news|author=Evans, Billy|title=Michigan Boasts Two Great Stars|publisher=The Star Publications (Chicago)|May 3, 1927}}</ref> As the game wore on, the Buckeyes "seemed to realize (Goebel's) importance in the Michigan lineup because he was forced to take plenty of punishment."<ref name=Evans/>  Sports columnist [[Billy Evans]] wrote: <blockquote>"No end in recent years has played a greater game (than) that which Goebel put up against Ohio State. For three periods Goebel was the mainspring of the Michigan eleven. He seemed to be in every play. It was always Goebel who was gumming things up for State. No man could go through an entire game at the speed with which Goebel played in the first three quarters. It was beyond the power of any human being. With a few minutes to play in the third period the big fellow practically collapsed. Even when three or four of his teammates were carrying him off the field the old spirit was still there. He tried to induce his teammates that he was able to play, and tried to break away from their grasp, but the punch was gone and he was forced to give way as the big crowd cheered him to the echo. If any one man made possible the defeat of State by Michigan, it was Captain Paul Goebel."<ref name=Evans/> </blockquote>

For its fourth game, Michigan defeated Illinois, 24<U+2013>0.  After being held scoreless in the first quarter, Michigan scored 24 points in the second and third quarters.  Harry Bullion, writing in the ''Detroit Free Press'', described the game as follows: "Like an avalanche, slow to start but a blizzard when it gained momentum, the Maize and Blue eleven literally crushed the Suckers,<ref>Bullion's reference to the Illinois players as "Suckers" was not an insult, but rather a reference to a nickname then commonly used to refer to residents of Illinois.  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Illinois was known as the "Sucker State" and its residents as "Suckers."  A history of the nickname can be found in Gov. Thomas Ford's "[http://www.illinoishistory.com/winnebagowar.html The Winnebago War and why Illinoisans are 'Suckers'].</ref> buried them, as it were, under a decisive defeat."<ref name=DFPill/>  Michigan's three touchdowns were scored by [[Franklin Cappon]], [[Bernard Kirk]], and [[Herb Steger]].  Cappon's touchdown was set up when [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]] recovered a fumbled punt on the Illinois 20-yard line and ran it back to the 12-yard line.  Cappon scored on his third run into the Illinois line.  Later in the second quarter, [[Jack Blott]] intercepted a pass on the Illinois 27-yard line, and a pass from Steger to Kirk brought the ball to the 12-yard line.  Goebel kicked a filed goal from the 15-yard line to give Michigan a 10-0 lead at halftime.

The second half opened with Illinois kicking off to Michigan.  Kirk caught the ball at either the 15-yard line,<ref name=NYTill/> or the 20-yard line,<ref name=DFPill/> and returned it 80 or 85 yards for a touchdown.  Illinois quarterback Dawson clutched at Kirk's ankles at the 12-yard line, but Kirk was able to shake free and fell into the end zone.  As Kirk fell across the goal line, the steel and concrete stands at Ferry Field vibrated vociferously as the crowd reacted to the play.  Bullion wrote that Kirk's 80-yard return "will take rank with the most brilliant football achievements of any of Michigan's illustrious sons of the gridiron."<ref name=DFPill/>  Michigan's third touchdown came on a fourth-down pass from [[Ray Knode]] to [[Herb Steger]].  Steger was reported to have been standing across the goal line "as clean as a hound's tooth unguarded."<ref name=DFPill/><ref name=TD>There is a discrepancy in game accounts as to who scored Michigan's final touchdown against Illinois. The ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' account indicates that the touchdown came on a pass from Knode to Steger, with Steger being credited with the touchdown.  The [[Associated Press]]'s account of the game, published in ''The New York Times'', indicates that the final touchdown pass was from Knode to Uteritz, with Uteritz being credited with the touchdown.  The "Scoring leaders" table in this article is based upon the account from the ''Detroit Free Press'' giving the touchdown to Steger.</ref>  Extra points were kicked by [[Paul G.

For its fifth game, Michigan defeated the team from Michigan Agricultural College, 63<U+2013>0.  Lloyd Northard wrote in the ''Detroit Free Press'' that "not in the past 10 years has an Aggie team been so utterly out-classed in every department of the game."<ref name=DFPMAC/>  Fulling embracing the passing game, Michigan threw 33 passes with 17 completions.  Northard wrote that the game at times "more resembled basketball than football" and called it "the greatest exhibition of aerial play ever witnessed on Ferry Field," setting Ferry Field records for both passes thrown and completed.<ref name=DFPMAC/>  

Michigan's first touchdown came on a 29-yard pass completion from [[Harry G. Kipke|Harry Kipke]] to [[Irwin Uteritz]].  Uteritz injured his ankle on the play and was replaced at quarterback by [[Ray Knode]].  [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]] place-kicked for the extra point.  On Michigan's second scoring drive, Kipke accounted for most of Michigan's 56-yard drive, and Knode ran for the touchdown from the one-yard line.  Goebel again place-kicked for the extra point.  At the start of the second quarter, Michigan drove 53 yards for its third touchdown.  The drive featured runs of 16 and 18 yards by Kipke around the ends and 17-yard gain on a pass from Kipke to [[Jackson Keefer]].  [[Franklin Cappon]] carried the ball across the goal line for the touchdown.  Goebel missed the extra point, and Michigan led, 20-0.  Later in the quarter, Michigan drove 66 yards for its fourth touchdown.  The drive featured a 46-yard gain on a pass from Knode to Goebel who was tackled at the Aggies' 20-yard line.  Cappon carried the ball over the goal line for his second touchdown of the quarter.  Kipke drop-kicked for the extra point, and Michigan led, 27-0.  Near the end of the first half, [[Stanley Muirhead]] blocked a punt on the Aggies' 12-yard line.  Michigan faked a field goal, and Goebel passed to Keefer for the touchdown.  Kipke missed the extra point, and Michigan led, 33-0, at halftime.<ref name=DFPMAC/>

During the third quarter, Michigan played with substitutes at every position.  

Michigan's nine touchdowns were scored by [[Ray Knode]] (2), [[Franklin Cappon]] (2), [[Irwin Uteritz]], [[Harry G. Kipke|Harry Kipke]], [[Herb Steger]], [[Jackson Keefer]], and LeRoy Neisch.  Extra points were kicked by [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]], Kipke (3), Knode, and Steger.  Steger also added a field goal.<ref name=DFPMAC/>

After a [[Bye (sports)#Gridiron football and Major League Baseball|bye week]], Michigan played Wisconsin at Ferry Field on November 18, 1922.  A week before the game, ''The New York Times'' reported that demand for tickets was so intense that even [[Henry Ford]] was unable to obtain seats.<ref>{{cite news|title=No Michigan Football Seats Left, Even for Henry Ford|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 11, 1922|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9506EFD71F39EF3ABC4952DFB7678389639EDE&scp=1&sq=michigan+%26+ford&st=p}}</ref>  The game drew a crowd of 42,000 spectators <U+2013> estimated to be "at least as large as the record breaking number" who attended the 1921 Michigan<U+2013>Ohio State game.  Michigan's head coach, Fielding Yost, traveled to watch Wisconsin play Minnesota one week earlier, and the Associated Press called the game "a clear example of the value of scouting football games," as Wisconsin had no plays that had not already been studied closely by Yost.<ref name=APWI>{{cite news|title=U. of M.

In the first half, defense dominated, and neither team scored.  A drive into Michigan territory during the second quarter was stopped when [[Jackson Keefer]] intercepted a Wisconsin pass.  In the second half, cloud cover brought darkness to the field.  Michigan opened up its offense with a passing attack that Yost had been developing for three weeks.<ref name=APWI/>  The Associated Press called Michigan's second half attack "one of the most brilliant ever seen on Ferry Field."<ref name=NYTWI>{{cite news|title=Wolverines Defeat Wisconsin Eleven: Michigan Captures Hard-Fought Gridiron Battle by the Score of 13 to 6|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1922|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04E1DE1E39E133A2575AC1A9679D946395D6CF&scp=2&sq=michigan+%26+wisconsin&st=p}}</ref>  In the third quarter, [[Harry G. Kipke|Harry Kipke]] led Michigan on a 65-yard scoring drive that included a 25-yard pass from [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]] to Kipke, a 10-yard pass from Kipke to Keefer, and runs of 10 and 11 yards by Kipke.  Fullback [[Franklin Cappon]] carried the ball from the one-yard line for the touchdown, and Goebel kicked the extra point from placement.  Michigan led 7<U+2013>0 at the end of the third quarter.<ref name=APWI/>  

Early in the fourth quarter, [[Irwin Uteritz]] threw to Kipke from mid-field, and Kipke ran 40 yards for Michigan's second touchdown.  The Associated Press wrote:<blockquote>"His run of nearly half the length of the field for a touchdown in the final period was all the most ardent seeker after football thrills could ask.  During the first 20 yards of the run Kipke eluded a number of Wisconsin players by dodging around them.  Then he fell in behind a trio of Wolverines who provided interference and his run was unbroken."<ref name=APWI/></blockquote>

Kipke's drop-kick for the extra point was unsuccessful, and Michigan led 13<U+2013>0.  Late in the fourth quarter, a punt by Kipke went out of bounds at Michigan's 42-yard line, and Wisconsin drove down the field to score the first points allowed by Michigan during the 1922 season. The touchdown was scored by Pulaski on a pass from Wallace Barr.  Merrill Taft's drop-kick for the extra point was blocked, and the game ended on the ensuing kick return.  Michigan won, 13<U+2013>6.<ref name=APWI/>

Only one penalty was called in the game, a 15-yard holding penalty against Wisconsin.<ref name=APWI/>  Former University of Chicago All-American [[Walter Eckersall]] served as the linesman.<ref name=NYTWI/>  After watching the game, Eckersall opined that Yost "has lost none of his cunning."<ref name=Eck/>  He cited two plays as evidence of the mental acuity of the Michigan team.  The first play followed a substitute coming into the game to replace Wisconsin's All-American end [[Gus Tebell]].  Uteritz faked a handoff to Cappon who dove into the middle of the line, drawing the Wisconsin substitute into the play while Kipke ran around the end.  The second play was "the old talking play" in which Michigan's team captain Goebel walked from his position at right end, appearing to reprimand Uteritz for the prior call.  According to Eckersall, "The Badger forwards relaxed in their charging positions and as they did so the ball was snapped and another large gain was made."<ref name=Eck>1923 Michiganensian, "Football," by Walter H. Eckersall, p. 218.</ref>

Michigan's starting lineup against Wisconsin was Kirk (left end), Rosatti (left tackle), Steele (left guard), Blott (center), Slaughter (right guard), Muirhead (right tackle), Goebel (right end), Uteritz (quarterback), Kipke (left halfback), Steger (right halfback), and Cappon (fullback).<ref name=NYTWI/>

Michigan finished its season on the road against [[1922 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]].  The Wolverines won, 16<U+2013>7, securing a tie with [[1922 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] for the Big Ten championship.  The 1922 Minnesota team was led by [[Earl Martineau]], who was a first-team halfback on the ''[[New York Tribune]]'''s [[1922 College Football All-America Team]] (and who later served as an assistant coach at Michigan from 1938<U+2013>1945).

In the first quarter, Minnesota recovered a fumble at Michigan's eight-yard line.  On second down from the seven-yard line, Otis McCreary ran between Michigan's left tackle and left guard for a touchdown.  [[Ray Eklund]] drop-kicked for the extra point, and Minnesota led, 7<U+2013>0.  In the second quarter, Martineau punted from his own endzone, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Minnesota 17-yard line.  Michigan drove to the one-yard line on runs by Harry Kipke and [[Franklin Cappon]].  Kipke ran it in on a sweep around Minnesota's left end for the touchdown.  [[Paul G. Goebel|Paul Goebel]]'s place-kick for the extra point was low, and Minnesota's lead was narrowed to 7<U+2013>6.  Late in the second quarter, [[Irwin Uteritz]] returned a punt 20 yards to Michigan's 46-yard line. The Wolverines then drove 54 yards, mostly on a 44-yard run by Cappon.  At the end of the drive, Cappon dove into the endzone from the one-foot line, and [[Jack Blott]] converted the extra point from a place-kick.  Michigan led 13<U+2013>7 at halftime.

In the second half, Michigan held Minnesota scoreless and intercepted five of Martineau's passes (three by Kipke and two by [[Jackson Keefer]]).  Michigan's final points were scored after a pass from Uteritz to [[Bernard Kirk]] took the ball to Minnesota's 17-yard line.  The drive was halted at the ten-yard line, and Blott kicked a field goal from the 20-yard line.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michigan Team Is Given An Ovation By Student Body: Yost Says He Has NO Idea When He Will Retire as Head Coach|newspaper=Owosso Argus-Press|date=November 27, 1922|page=8|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v88oAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VgYGAAAAIBAJ&pg=1935,2349392&dq=michigan+minnesota&hl=en}}</ref><ref name=NYTMN>{{cite news|title=Wolverines Beat Gophers, 16 to 7: Michigan Retains Its Claim, With Iowa, to 1922 Big Ten Championship|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 26, 1922|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403EEDC1E39E133A25755C2A9679D946395D6CF&scp=3&sq=michigan+%26+minnesota&st=p}}</ref><ref>1923 Michiganensian, "Review of Season," p. 225.</ref>
