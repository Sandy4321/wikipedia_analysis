==Life and career==
George Cook was born in [[Coventry]].Upon his discharge from the Royal Navy at the close of [[World War II]], Cook joined an amateur operatic society in Coventry. Encouraged by his success, he moved to London and studied voice.  

Cook joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company chorus in 1954, soon assuming the role of the Carpenter's Mate in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''. In 1955, he also began to play the mute role of the Associate in ''[[Trial by Jury]]''. Beginning in 1956, he added to his repertory the roles of Sergeant Bouncer in ''[[Cox and Box]]'', the Usher in ''Trial'', the Boatswain's Mate in ''Pinafore'', and Samuel in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''. 

In 1956 Cook began to play the role of Giorgio in ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', while also serving as understudy for the principal baritone roles. He also took on the role of Scynthius in ''[[Princess Ida]]'' in 1957, and the roles of Go-To in ''[[The Mikado]]'' and Sergeant of Police in ''Pirates'' in 1962.  Finally, in 1963, he added the role of Old Adam in ''[[Ruddigore]]''.  He regularly played these roles until he left the D'Oyly Carte organisation in 1969.

In addition, as understudy to [[Kenneth Sandford]], he often played Private Willis in ''[[Iolanthe]]'', King Hildebrand in ''Princess Ida'', Pooh-Bah in ''The Mikado'', Sir Despard Murgatroyd in ''Ruddigore'', Wilfred Shadbolt in ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', and Don Alhambra in ''The Gondoliers''.   

Cook was also known for crafting the Japanese-style fans used by D'Oyly Carte and numerous amateur G&S societies for productions of ''The Mikado'' throughout the UK and abroad. After leaving D'Oyly Carte, Cook sang with ''Gilbert and Sullivan for All'' in his spare time.  His wife joined the [[English National Opera]] chorus in 1984 and sang with that company for 13 years, into her 60s.
