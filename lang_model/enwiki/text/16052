'''''No-pan kissa''''' (<U+30CE><U+30FC><U+30D1><U+30F3><U+55AB><U+8336>, literally "no-panties cafe") is a Japanese term for cafes where the waitresses wear short skirts with no underwear.  The floors, or sections of the floor, are often mirrored.

==Concept==
Customers order drinks and snacks and may look at, but not generally touch, the staff.<ref name=allison1994>{{cite book | title=Nightwork: sexuality, pleasure, and corporate masculinity in a Tokyo hostess club | first=Anne | last=Allison | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1994 | isbn=0-226-01487-8 | pages=131<U+2013>132 }}</ref> The shops otherwise look like normal coffee shops, rather than sex establishments, although they charge around four times as much for coffee (typically 700 [[yen]] for a coffee). Previously most sex establishments had been establishments such as [[soapland]]s and [[pink salon]]s with professional prostitutes. ''No-pan kissa'' were a popular employment choice amongst some women because they paid well and generally required little sexual contact with the customers. Many employees were college students who were earning extra money.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==History==
The first one to open was in [[Osaka]] in 1980 <ref>{{cite book | title=Behind the mask: on sexual demons, sacred mothers, transvestites, gangsters, drifters and other Japanese cultural heroes | first=Ian | last=Buruma | publisher=Pantheon Books | year=1984 | isbn=0-394-53775-0 | page=111}}</ref> and then in [[Higashi-Nagasaki Station|Higashi-Nagasaki]] in [[Tokyo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Initially all of them were in remote areas outside the traditional entertainment districts. Within a year large numbers had opened in many more places, such as major railway stations.<ref>{{cite book | title=Neighborhood Tokyo | series=Studies of the East Asian Institute | first=Theodore C. | last=Bestor | publisher=Stanford University Press | year=1989 | isbn=0-8047-1797-4 | page=42 }}</ref>

In the peak of the boom in these shops in the 1980s, many started to have topless or bottomless waitresses. However, at this point the number of such shops started to decline rapidly.

A later development in certain ''no-pan kissa'' was the creation of small private rooms where the staff provided sexual services like [[oral sex]] or [[masturbation]].

Eventually such coffee shops gave way to [[fashion health]] clubs, and few, if any, remain. The [[New Amusement Business Control and Improvement Act]] came into force on February 13, 1985, which further restricted the sex industry, and protected the more traditional businesses.

==Variations==
In addition to ''no-pan kissa'', there have also been ''no-pan'' [[shabu-shabu]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m-YVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-RQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5251,3800843&dq=no-pan+shabu+shabu&hl=en | journal=New Sunday Times | title=Ministry officials 'demanded' sex club entertainment | date=28 January 1998 | accessdate=2012-12-28 }}</ref> and ''no-pan'' [[yakiniku]] restaurants;{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} and ''no-pan'' [[karaoke]].<ref name=allison1994/><ref name=allison2000>{{cite book | title=Permitted and prohibited desires: mothers, comics, and censorship in Japan | first=Anne | last=Allison | publisher=University of California Press | year=2000 | isbn=0-520-21990-2 | page=170 }}</ref>
