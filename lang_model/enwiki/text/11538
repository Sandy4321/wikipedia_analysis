'''Thomas Timothy "Tim" Holden''' (born March 5, 1957) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|PA|17}}, serving since 1993. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Holden is the [[wikt:Dean|Dean]] of the [[Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation]], as of 2012.<ref name=rh>{{cite news|first=Peter E.|last=Bortner|title=Holden seeks 11th term, says he stands for hard work |url=http://republicanherald.com/news/holden-seeks-11th-term-says-he-stands-for-hard-work-1.1303775 |work=[[Republican & Herald]]  |publisher= |date=2012-04-22 |accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref> On April 24, 2012, Holden was defeated in the Democratic primary in his attempt to be re-elected.<ref>Weisman, Jonathan.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Holden graduated from [[St. Clair, Pennsylvania|St. Clair Area High School]] in [[St. Clair, Pennsylvania]] in 1975. In 1980, he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[sociology]] from [[Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania]]. He became a licensed real estate agent, and later an insurance broker in 1983. He has worked as a probation officer and as [[Sergeant-at-Arms]] for the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]], and was the sheriff of [[Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Schuylkill County]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
In the 1990s, he represented [[Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district]] based in [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] and including [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks]] and Schuylkill counties. The district was populated mostly by [[Reagan Democrat]]s who were still willing to vote [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in most elections (it voted for [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992, [[Bob Dole]] in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]] and George W. Bush in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]), but Holden was re-elected four times without serious opposition.

;1992
After redistricting, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman [[Gus Yatron]] decided to retire. In the Democratic primary, Holden defeated Warren Haggerty and John Reusing 39%-32%-28%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=210024 |title=PA District 06 - D Primary Race - Apr 28, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee [[John E. Jones III]], a local government solicitor, 52%-48%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=28400 |title=PA District 6 Race - Nov 03, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

;1994
Holden won re-election to a second term by defeating Republican nominee Fred Levering 57%-43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29316 |title=PA District 6 Race - Nov 08, 1994 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

;1996
Holden won re-election to a third term by defeating Republican nominee Christian Leinbach, a staffer to U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.berks.pa.us/Dept/Commissioners/Pages/CommissionerLeinbach%27sBiography.aspx |title=Commissioner Leinbach's Biography |publisher=Co.berks.pa.us |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> 59%-41%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=29742 |title=PA District 6 Race - Nov 05, 1996 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

;1998
Holden won re-election to a fourth term by defeating Republican nominee John Meckley 61%-39%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30864 |title=PA District 6 Race - Nov 03, 1998 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

;2000
Holden won re-election to a fifth term by defeating Republican nominee Thomas Kopel 66%-34%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=605 |title=PA District 6 Race - Nov 07, 2000 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>

;2002
[[File:17th Congressional District.gif||300px|thumb|The previously make-up of the 17th Congressional District from 2003, which has been represented by Congressman Tim Holden.]]
Pennsylvania lost two districts after the [[2000 United States Census]]. The Republican-controlled [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly]] dismantled the 6th, splitting its territory among three other districts. The legislature considered placing Holden's home in Schuylkill County in the 11th District, a heavily Democratic area in northeastern Pennsylvania. This would have forced a primary matchup with [[Paul Kanjorski]], an eight-term Democrat who was slightly more liberal than Holden. Eventually, it moved Holden's home to the Republican-leaning [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]-based 17th District, represented by 10-term Republican [[George Gekas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec02/pennsylvania_8-30.html |title=Online NewsHour: Election 2002: High Stakes |publisher=Pbs.org |date=2002-08-30 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> On paper, the redrawn 17th appeared to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was a blatant [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]] intended to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% of his former territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% of the vote in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2002/races/pa_holden.html |title=Online NewsHour: The Pennsylvania 17th District Race - Tim Holden Biography |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, ''[[The Patriot-News]]'', endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited [[African American]] neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had never set foot in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.

;2004
Holden ran for re-election against Republican lawyer Scott Paterno, son of legendary [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] [[college football|football]] coach [[Joe Paterno]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04119/307826.stm |title=U.S. House races: Paterno's son beats crowded field in 17th |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=2004-04-28 |accessdate=2010-07-12 | first=Bill | last=Toland}}</ref> Paterno was actively supported by influential Republicans, and President Bush and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] came to the district several times to support him. Nevertheless, Holden won re-election by a comfortable margin even as Bush easily carried the district.

;2006
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006#17th Congressional district}}
Holden faced Republican Matthew Wertz, an [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|Afghanistan War]] veteran, in the 2006. However, Wertz dropped out of the race before the general election citing personal reasons and Holden went on to easily win re-election with 65% of the total vote.<ref name=har>{{cite news |first=Brett|last=Lieberman|authorlink=|title= State police retiree plans bid for Holden's seat|url= http://www.pennlive.com/news/patriotnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1183512312182680.xml&coll=1|work= [[Harrisburg Patriot-News]] |publisher= |date=2007-07-04 |accessdate=2007-08-02 }}</ref>

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#District 17}}
In 2008, he faced Republican Toni Gilhooley, a retired [[Pennsylvania State Police|Pennsylvania State Trooper]] and 25 year veteran of the force, whom he defeated with 64% of the vote (one percent less than the previous election).

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010#District 17}}
Holden was challenged by Republican nominee, [[Pennsylvania State Senate|State Senator]] [[Dave Argall]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dustin|last=Pangonis|authorlink=|title= 'No' vote on health care costs Holden primary endorsement from AFL-CIO |url= http://republicanherald.com/news/no-vote-on-health-care-costs-holden-primary-endorsement-from-afl-cio-1.710090|work= [[Republican & Herald]] |publisher= |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2010-04-02 }}</ref> Unlike other Democrats in Eastern Pennsylvania like [[Chris Carney]] and [[Patrick Murphy (politician)|Patrick Murphy]], Holden won re-election, and did so with a 12 point margin, defeating Argall 56% to 44%.

Before Holden won the general election, he faced a primary challenge within his own party from political activist Sheila Dow Ford, who ran to the left of Holden, eviscerating the Congressman for voting against the [[Affordable Care Act]] in [[March 2010]]. Holden defeated Ford by a margin of 65% to 35% in the primary to regain the Democratic nomination.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012#District 17}}
The 17th district which Holden represents was drastically reconfigured as a result of legislative redistricting done in the Pennsylvania legislature in late 2011 following the results of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]]. This redistricting took [[Harrisburg]] outside of the district while keeping most of Holden's hometown region, including St. Clair, while adding the cities of [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], [[Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Easton, Pennsylvania|Easton]], among other various towns in [[Luzerne County]], [[Lackawanna County]], [[Carbon County, Pennsylvania|Carbon County]], [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]] and [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton County]]. Under the new redistricting map, the portions of [[Berks County]], [[Dauphin County]], [[Lebanon County]], and [[Perry County, Pennsylvania|Perry County]], which Holden had represented since 2003, were removed from his district, which shifted to the northeast. As a result of these changes, Holden's district is now considerably more Democratic, nearing 60 percent Democratic registration.  

[[Moosic, Pennsylvania|Moosic]] Attorney [[Matt Cartwright (Pennsylvania politician)|Matt Cartwright]] defeated Tim Holden in the primary for the Democratic nomination on April 24th 2012. Holden's opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and climate change legislation are believed to have contributed to his defeat by a more liberal opponent.<ref name=NYTloss>{{cite news|title=2 House Democrats Defeated After Opposing Health Law|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/us/politics/2-house-democrats-defeated-after-opposing-health-law.html|accessdate=April 26, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2012|author=Jonathan Weisman}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Holden is a member of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]].<ref name="Issues">[http://www.timholden.com/issues Issues], ''Tim Holden for U.S. Congress</ref> As such, Holden is a more conservative Democrat than most of his colleagues in his party's caucus in the House of Representatives. Although he has often bucked his party's voting trend, Holden has supported Democratic priorities on a number of issues. While Holden voted with a minority of House Democrats in favor of the authorization for the use of U.S. force in [[Iraq]] in October 2002 for President [[George W. Bush]], he strongly opposed Bush's "surge" policy in January 2007. While Holden voted against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the signature legislative domestic policy achievement of President [[Barack Obama]], in March 2010, he did vote for the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]], signed into law by Obama, in February 2009. While Holden voted for legislation supported by President Bush that toughened bankruptcy laws and enacted the [[Halliburton loophole]], he voted for the [[Dodd<U+2013>Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], signed into law by President Obama, in July 2010. According to opencongreess.com, Holden has voted with the Democratic leadership in Congress 73 percent of the time in recent years. He is ranked as one of the top fifteen most conservative Democrats in the House by the ''[[National Journal]]''.

In 2011, Rep. Holden became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]]. <ref name="govtrack">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3261 Bill H.R.3261]; GovTrack.us;</ref> Holden withdrew his co-sponsorship of SOPA on January 18, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Summary & Status 112th Congress (2011 - 2012) H.R.3261 Cosponsors|work=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:1:./temp/~bd666m:@@@P{{!}}/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS;c=112||publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref> 

Holden represented the 6th District from 1993 until 2003, and following redistricting he has represented the 17th District.
