'''Edward III''' (13 November 1312 <U+2013> 21 June 1377) was one of the most successful [[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|English monarchs]] of the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]. Restoring royal authority after the disastrous reign of his father, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], Edward III went on to transform the [[Kingdom of England]] into the most efficient military power in Europe. His reign saw vital developments in legislature and government<U+2014>in particular the evolution of the English parliament<U+2014>as well as the ravages of the [[Black Death]]. He remained on the throne for 50 years; no English monarch had reigned for as long since [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], and none would again until [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], as King of the [[United Kingdom]].

Edward was crowned at the age of fourteen, following the [[deposition (politics)|deposition]] of his father. When he was only seventeen years old, he led a coup against his [[regent]], [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and began his personal reign. After defeating, but not subjugating, the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], he declared himself rightful heir to the French throne in 1338, starting what would be known as the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Following some initial setbacks, the war went exceptionally well for England; the victories of [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy|Cr<U+00E9>cy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] led up to the highly favourable [[Treaty of Br<U+00E9>tigny]]. Edward<U+2019>s later years, however, were marked by international failure and domestic strife, largely as a result of his inertia and eventual bad health.

Edward III was a temperamental man, but also capable of great clemency. He was, in most ways, a conventional king, mainly interested in warfare. Highly revered in his own time and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later [[Whig history|Whig historians]]. This view has turned, and modern [[historiography]] credits him with many achievements<ref name="ReferenceA">Mortimer, ''The Perfect King - The Life of Edward III, Father of the English Nation'', 1.</ref>.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Edward was born at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] on 13 November 1312, and was called '''Edward of Windsor''' in his early years. The reign of his father, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], was fraught with military defeat, rebellious barons and corrupt courtiers, but the birth of a male heir in 1312 temporarily strengthened Edward II's position on the throne.<ref>For an account of Edward II's later years, see Fryde, Natalie (1979). ''The Tyranny and Fall of Edward II, 1321<U+2013>1326''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-22201-X.</ref> To further this end, in what was probably an attempt by his father to shore up royal supremacy after years of discontent, Edward was created [[Earl of Chester]] at the age of only twelve days, and less than two months later, his father gave him a full household of servants for his court, so he could live independently as if he were a full adult Nobleman.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

On 20 January 1327, when the young Edward was fourteen years old, his mother the queen [[Isabella of France|Isabella]] and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]] [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] the king. Edward, now Edward III, was crowned on 1 February, with Isabella and Mortimer as [[regent]]s. Mortimer, the ''[[de facto]]'' ruler of England, subjected the young king to constant disrespect and humiliation. On 24 January 1328 the fifteen-year-old king married sixteen year old [[Philippa of Hainault]] at [[York Minster]].<ref>Michael, 'A Manuscript Wedding Gift from Philippa of Hainault to Edward III', 582.</ref>

Mortimer knew his position was precarious, especially after Philippa had a son on 15 June 1330.<ref>Ormrod, ''Reign of Edward III'', 6.</ref> Mortimer used his power to acquire noble estates and titles, many of them belonging to [[Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel]]. FitzAlan, who had remained loyal to Edward II in his struggle with Isabella and Mortimer, had been executed on 17 November 1326. However Mortimer's greed and arrogance caused many of the other nobles to hate him; all this was not lost on the young king.

The young, headstrong king had never forgotten the fate of his father, or how he himself had been treated as a child. At almost 18 years old, Edward was ready to take his revenge. On 19 October 1330, Mortimer and Isabella were sleeping at [[Nottingham Castle]]. Under the cover of night, a group loyal to Edward entered the fortress through a secret passageway and burst into Mortimer's quarters. Those conducting the coup arrested Mortimer in the name of the king, and he was taken to the [[Tower of London]]. Stripped of his land and titles, he was hauled before the 17-year-old king and accused of assuming royal authority over England. Edward's mother<U+2014>presumably pregnant with Mortimer's child<U+2014>begged her son for mercy to no avail. Without trial, Edward sentenced Mortimer to death one month after the coup. As Mortimer was executed, Edward's mother was exiled in [[Castle Rising]] where she reportedly miscarried. By his 18th birthday, Edward's vengeance was complete and he became de facto ruler of England.

===Early reign===
[[File:Edward III 1344 noble gold 33mm 6780mg.jpg|thumb|Gold [[Noble (English coin)|Noble]] of Edward III, 1344, 33mm, 6.78g.]]
Edward chose to renew the military conflict with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] in which his [[Edward II of England|father]] and [[Edward I of England|grandfather]] had engaged with varying success. Edward repudiated the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton|Treaty of Northampton]] that had been signed during the regency, thus renewing claims of English sovereignty over Scotland and resulting in the [[Second War of Scottish Independence]].

Intending to regain what the English had conceded, he won back control of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] and secured a decisive English victory at the [[Battle of Halidon Hill]] in 1333 against the forces of the boy-king [[David II of Scotland]]. Edward III was now in a position to put [[Edward Balliol]] on the throne of Scotland and claim a reward of 2,000 librates of land in the southern counties - the Lothians, Roxburghshire, Berwickshire, Dumfriesshire, Lanarkshire and Peebleshire. Despite the victories of Dupplin and Halidon, the Bruce party soon started to recover and by the close of 1335 and the [[Battle of Culblean]], the Plantagenet occupation was in difficulties and the Balliol party was fast losing ground.

At this time, in 1336, Edward III's brother [[John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall]] died. [[John of Fordun]]'s ''Gesta Annalia'' is alone in claiming that Edward killed his brother in a quarrel at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].

Although Edward III committed very large armies to Scottish operations, by 1337 the vast majority of Scotland had been recovered by the forces of David II, leaving only a few castles such as Edinburgh, Roxburgh and Stirling in Plantagenet possession. These installations were not adequate to impose Edward's rule and by 1338/9 Edward had moved from a policy of conquest to one of containment.

Edward faced military problems on two fronts; the challenge from the [[France|French]] monarchy was of no less concern. The French represented a problem in three areas: first, they provided constant support to the Scottish through the [[Auld Alliance|Franco-Scottish alliance]]. [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]] protected David II in exile, and supported Scottish raids in [[Northern England]]. Second, the French attacked several English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale invasion.<ref>Ormrod, ''Reign of Edward III'', 9.</ref> Finally, the English king's possessions in France were under threat<U+2014>in 1337, Philip VI confiscated the duchy of [[Aquitaine]] and the county of [[Ponthieu]].

Instead of seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, Edward laid  claim to the French crown as the only living male descendant of his deceased maternal grandfather, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]. The French, however, invoked the [[Salic law]] of succession and rejected the claim, pronouncing Philip IV's nephew, Philip VI, the true heir ([[Edward III of England#Family tree|see below]]) and thereby setting the stage for the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Edward incorporated England's coat of arms, rampant lions, and France's coat of arms, the fleurs de lys, and declared himself king of both England and France.<ref>Hanawalt, ''The Middle Ages: An Illustrated History'', 133.</ref>

[[File:Edward III becomes Vicar to the Emperor Ludwig V.jpg|thumb|Edward III becomes Vicar to the Emperor Ludwig IV.]]
In the war against France, Edward built alliances and fought by proxy through minor French princes. In 1338, [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] named him vicar-general of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and promised his support. These measures, however, produced few results; the only major military gain made in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at [[Battle of Sluys|Sluys]] on 24 June 1340, where 16,000 French soldiers and sailors died.

Meanwhile, the fiscal pressure on the kingdom caused by Edward's expensive alliances led to discontent at home. In response he returned unannounced on 30 November 1340. Finding the affairs of the realm in disorder, he purged the royal administration<ref>Fryde, N.M. (1978). "Edward III's removal of his ministers and judges, 1340<U+2013>1", ''British Institute of Historical Research'' 48, pp. 149<U+2013>61.</ref>, and defaulted on England's external debt (the first of only two defaults on such debt in all of English history)<ref>''This Time Is Different,'' Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009, p. 87</ref> which may have contributed to the collapse of [[Compagnia dei Bardi]]. These measures did not bring domestic stability, however, and a standoff ensued between the king and [[John de Stratford]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].

Edward, at the [[Parliament of England]] of April 1341, was forced to accept severe limitations to his financial and administrative prerogatives. Yet, in October of the same year, the king repudiated this statute, and Archbishop Stratford was politically ostracised. The extraordinary circumstances of the 1341 parliament had forced the king into submission, but under normal circumstances the powers of the king in medieval England were virtually unlimited, and Edward took advantage of this.<ref>Ormrod, ''Reign of Edward III'', 16.</ref>

===Fortunes of war===
[[File:Edward III Aquitaine 3860mg.jpg|thumb|Coin of Edward III as [[Duke of Aquitaine]], 3.86g.]]
After much inconclusive campaigning in [[Continental Europe]], Edward decided to stage a major offensive in 1346, sailing for [[Normandy]] with a force of 15,000 men.<ref>[[May McKisack|McKisack]], ''Fourteenth Century'', 132.</ref> His army [[Battle of Caen (1346)|sacked the city of Caen]] and marched across northern France. On 26 August he met the French king's forces in pitched battle at [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy|Cr<U+00E9>cy]] and won a decisive victory. Meanwhile, back home, [[William Zouche]], the Archbishop of [[York]] mobilized an army to oppose David II, who had returned, defeating and capturing him at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] on 17 October. With his northern border having been secured, Edward felt free to continue his major offensive against France, [[Siege of Calais|laying siege to the town of Calais]], which fell after almost a year<U+2014>probably the greatest single military operation undertaken by the English state in the Middle Ages{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}<U+2014>in August of 1347.

After the death of the Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV in October of 1347, his son [[Louis V, Duke of Bavaria]] negotiated with Edward to compete against the new German king [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], but Edward finally decided in May 1348 not to run for the German crown.

In 1348, the [[Black Death]] struck [[Europe]] with full force, killing a third or more of England's population.<ref>Hatcher, J. (1977) ''Plague, Population and the English Economy, 1348<U+2013>1530'' London: Macmillan ISBN 0-333-21293-2.</ref> This loss of manpower meant a halt to major campaigning. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labor cost. Attempting to cap wages, the king and parliament responded with the [[Ordinance of Labourers]] (1349) and the [[Statute of Labourers of 1351|Statute of Labourers]] (1351). The plague did not, however, lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift.<ref>Prestwich, ''Plantagenet England'', 553.</ref>

In 1356, Edward's oldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], won a great victory at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|battle of Poitiers]]. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed the French but captured the French king, [[John II of France|John II]]. After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, the French king was in English custody, and the French central government had almost totally collapsed. Whether Edward's claim to the French crown originally was genuine or just a political ploy,<ref>For a discussion of this question, see Prestwich, ''Plantagenet England'', 307<U+2013>10.</ref> it now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the [[Treaty of Br<U+00E9>tigny]], whereby he renounced his claims to the French throne but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.

===Later reign===
[[File:Edward III Black Prince 14thc.jpg|thumb|Edward III and [[Edward, the Black Prince]]]]
While Edward's early reign had been energetic and successful, his later years were marked by inertia, military failure and political strife. The day-to-day affairs of the state had less appeal to Edward than military campaigning, so during the 1360s Edward increasingly relied on the help of his subordinates, in particular [[William of Wykeham|William Wykeham]]. A relative upstart, Wykeham was made [[Lord Privy Seal]] in 1363 and [[List of Lord Chancellors and Lord Keepers|Lord Chancellor]] in 1367, though due to political difficulties connected with his inexperience, the Parliament forced him to resign the chancellorship in 1371.<ref>Ormrod, "Reign of Edward III", 90<U+2013>4; Ormrod, "Edward III", ''DNB''.</ref>

Compounding Edward's difficulties were the deaths of his most trusted men, some from the 1361<U+2013>62 recurrence of the plague. [[William Montacute, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montacute]], Edward's companion in the 1330 coup, was dead by 1344. [[William de Clinton, 1st Earl of Huntingdon|William de Clinton]], who had also been with the king at Nottingham, died in 1354. One of the earls of 1337, [[William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton|William de Bohun]], died in 1360, and the next year [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry of Grosmont]], perhaps the greatest of Edward's captains, succumbed to what was probably plague. Their deaths left the majority of the magnates younger and more naturally aligned to the princes than to the king himself.

The king's second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]], attempted to subdue by force the largely autonomous [[Hiberno-Norman|Anglo-Irish]] lords in [[Ireland]]. The venture failed, and the only lasting mark he left were the suppressive [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1366.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 231.</ref>

In France, meanwhile, the decade following the Treaty of Br<U+00E9>tigny was one of relative tranquillity, but on 8 April 1364 [[John II of France|John II]] died in captivity in England, after unsuccessfully trying to raise his own ransom at home. He was followed by the vigorous [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], who enlisted the help of the capable [[Constable of France|Constable]] [[Bertrand du Guesclin]].<ref>Ormrod, "Reign of Edward III", 27.</ref> In 1369, the [[Hundred Years' War|French war]] started anew, and Edward's younger son [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] was given the responsibility of a military campaign. The effort failed, and with the Treaty of Bruges in 1375, the great English possessions in France were reduced to only the coastal towns of Calais, Bordeaux and Bayonne.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 145.</ref>

Military failure abroad and the associated fiscal pressure of campaigning led to political discontent at home. The problems came to a head in the parliament of 1376, the so-called [[Good Parliament]]. The parliament was called to grant taxation, but the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. [[Lord Chamberlain]] [[William Latimer]] and [[Lord Steward]] [[John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville de Raby]] were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, [[Alice Perrers]], who was seen to hold far too much power over the aging king, was banished from court.<ref>Ormrod, "Reign of Edward III", 35<U+2013>7; McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 387<U+2013>94.</ref>

Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and [[Edmund de Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]], was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but by its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.<ref>The earlier belief that Gaunt "packed" parliament in 1377 is no longer widely held. See Wedgewood, J. C. (1930) "John of Gaunt and the packing of parliament", ''English Historical Review'' 45, pp. 623<U+2013>5.</ref>

Edward himself, however, did not have much to do with any of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the government.<ref name="Ormrod, Edward III, DNB">Ormrod, "Edward III", ''DNB''.</ref> Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large [[abscess]]. After a brief period of recovery in February, the king died of a stroke (some sources say [[gonorrhea]]<ref>Cantor, ''In the Wake of the Plague'', 38</ref>) at Sheen on 21 June.<ref name="Ormrod, Edward III, DNB"/> He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]], son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince himself had died on 8 June 1376.

==Achievements of the reign==

===Legislation===
The middle years of Edward's reign was a period of significant activity. Perhaps the best known piece of legislation was the [[Statute of Labourers of 1351]], which addressed the labour shortage problem caused by the [[Black Death]]. The statute fixed wages at their pre-plague level and checked peasant mobility by asserting that lords had first claim on their men's services. In spite of concerted efforts to uphold the statute, it eventually failed due to competition among landowners for labour.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 335.</ref> The law has been described as an attempt "to legislate against the law of [[supply and demand]]", making it doomed to failure.<ref>Hanawalt, B. (1986). ''The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 139. ISBN 0-19-503649-2.</ref> Nevertheless, the labour shortage had created a community of interest between the smaller landowners of the House of Commons and the greater landowners of the [[House of Lords]]. The resulting measures angered the peasants, leading to the [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381.<ref>Prestwich, M. (1981). "Parliament and the community of the realm in the fourteenth century", in Art Cosgrove and J.I. McGuire (eds.) ''Parliament & Community'', p. 20.</ref>

The reign of Edward III coincided with the [[Avignon Papacy|Babylonian Captivity of the papacy at Avignon]]. During the wars with France, opposition emerged in England against perceived injustices by a papacy largely controlled by the French crown. Papal taxation of the English Church was suspected to be financing the nation's enemies, while the practice of provisions <U+2014> the [[Pope]] providing benefices for clerics <U+2014> caused resentment in the English population. The [[Praemunire|statutes of Provisors and Praemunire]], of 1350 and 1353 respectively, aimed to amend this by banning papal benefices, as well as limiting the power of the papal court over English subjects.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 280<U+2013>81.</ref> The statutes did not, however, sever the ties between the king and the Pope, who were equally dependent upon each other.

Other legislation of importance includes the [[Treason Act 1351|Treason Act of 1351]]. It was precisely the harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 257.</ref> Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]]. This institution began before the reign of Edward III, but by 1350, the justices had been given the power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of [[felony]]. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.<ref>Musson and Ormrod, ''Evolution of English Justice'', 50<U+2013>54.</ref>

===Parliament and taxation===
{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}
[[Parliament of England|Parliament]] as a representative institution was already well established by the time of Edward III{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, but the reign was nevertheless central to its development{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. During this period membership in the English [[baron]]age, formerly a somewhat indistinct group, became restricted to those who received a personal [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|summons]] to parliament.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 186<U+2013>7.</ref> This happened as parliament gradually developed into a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] institution composed of a [[House of Lords]] and a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The widening of political power can be seen in the crisis of the Good Parliament, where the Commons for the first time <U+2014> albeit with noble support <U+2014> were responsible for precipitating a political crisis. In the process, both the procedure of [[impeachment]] and the office of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] were created. Even though the political gains were of only temporary duration, this parliament represented a watershed in English political history{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The political influence of the Commons originally lay in its right to grant taxes{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The financial demands of the Hundred Years' War were enormous - at one point leading to the king declaring bankruptcy - and the king and his ministers tried different methods of covering the expenses. The king had a steady income from [[Crown Estate|crown lands]], and could also take up substantial loans from Italian and domestic financiers. To finance warfare on Edward III's scale, however, the king had to resort to taxation of his subjects. Taxation took two primary forms: [[Tax|levy]] and [[customs]]. The levy was a grant of a proportion of all moveable property, normally a tenth for towns and a fifteenth for farmland. This could produce large sums of money, but each such levy had to be approved by parliament, and the king had to prove the necessity.<ref>Brown, ''Governance'', 70<U+2013>1.</ref> The customs therefore provided a welcome supplement, as a steady and reliable source of income. An 'ancient duty' on the export of wool had existed since 1275. [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had tried to introduce an additional duty on wool, but this unpopular ''maltolt'', or 'unjust exaction', was soon abandoned. Then, from 1336 onwards, a series of schemes aimed at increasing royal revenues from wool export were introduced. After some initial problems and discontent, it was agreed through the [[Statute of the Staple|Ordinance of the Staple]] of 1353 that the new customs should be approved by parliament, though in reality they became permanent.<ref>Brown, ''Governance'', 67<U+2013>9, 226<U+2013>8.</ref>

Through the steady taxation of Edward III's reign, parliament<U+2014>and in particular the Commons<U+2014>gained political influence{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. A consensus emerged {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present [[petition]]s for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This way the system was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.<ref>Harriss, ''King, Parliament and Public Finance'', 509<U+2013>17.</ref>

===Chivalry and national identity===
[[File:The Great Seal of Edward III.JPG|thumb|The Great Seal of Edward III]]
Central to Edward III's policy was reliance on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration. While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage, Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects.

Both Edward I and Edward II had conducted a policy of limitation, allowing the creation of few peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III's reign. The young king reversed this policy when, in 1337, as a preparation for the imminent war, he created six new [[earl]]s on the same day.<ref>[[K.B. McFarlane]] (1973) ''The Nobility of Later Medieval England'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, pp. 158-9 ISBN 0-19-822362-5.</ref> At the same time, Edward expanded the ranks of the peerage upwards, by introducing the new title of [[duke]] for close relatives of the king.

Furthermore, Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the [[Order of the Garter]], probably in 1348. A plan from 1344 to revive the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]] of [[King Arthur]] never came to fruition, but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter. [[Polydore Vergil]] tells of how the young [[Joan of Kent]], Countess of Salisbury <U+2014>the king's favourite at the time<U+2014>accidentally dropped her [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] at a ball at Calais. King Edward responded to the ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words ''honi soit qui mal y pense''<U+2014>shame on him who thinks ill of it.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 251-2. Another candidate for the owner of the original garter was her mother-in-law Catherine Grandisson, the Dowager Countess of Salisbury.</ref>

This reinforcement of the aristocracy must be seen in conjunction with the war in France, as must the emerging sense of national identity. Just as the war with Scotland had done, the fear of a French invasion helped strengthen a sense of national unity, and nationalise the aristocracy that had been largely Anglo-French since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]. Since the time of Edward I, popular myth suggested that the French planned to extinguish the [[English language]], and as his grandfather had done, Edward III made the most of this scare.<ref>Prestwich, ''Three Edwards'', 209<U+2013>10.</ref> As a result, the English language experienced a strong revival; in 1362, a [[Statute of Pleading]] ordered the English language to be used in law courts [http://languageandlaw.org/TEXTS/STATS/PLEADING.HTM] and, the year after, Parliament was for the first time opened in English.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 524.</ref> At the same time, the vernacular saw a revival as a literary language, through the works of [[William Langland]], [[John Gower]] and especially ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].

Yet the extent of this [[Anglicisation]] must not be exaggerated. The statute of 1362 was in fact written in the [[French language]] and had little immediate effect,[http://lucasianchair.org/papers/EME.html] and parliament was opened in that language as late as 1377.<ref>Prestwich, ''Plantagenet England'', 556.</ref> The Order of the Garter, though a distinctly English institution, included also foreign members such as [[John V, Duke of Brittany]] and Sir Robert of [[Namur (province)|Namur]].<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 253; Prestwich, ''Plantagenet England'', 554.</ref> Edward III<U+2014>himself bilingual<U+2014>viewed himself as legitimate king of both England and France, and could not show preferential treatment for one part of his domains over another.

==Assessment and character==
Edward III enjoyed unprecedented popularity in his own lifetime, and even the troubles of his later reign were never blamed directly on the king himself.<ref>Ormrod, ''Reign of Edward III'', 37.</ref> Edward's contemporary [[Jean Froissart]] wrote in his [[Froissart's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] that "His like had not been seen since the days of King Arthur".<ref>Ormrod, ''Reign of Edward III'', 38. Froissart's predecessor, Jean le Bel, who had served under the king in 1327, likewise called Edward "Arthur come again."</ref> This view persisted for a while, but, with time, the image of the king changed. The [[Whig history|Whig]] historians of a later age preferred constitutional reform to foreign conquest and discredited Edward for ignoring his responsibilities to his own nation. In the words of [[William Stubbs|Bishop Stubbs]]:

{{cquote|Edward III was not a statesman, though he possessed some qualifications which might have made him a successful one. He was a warrior; ambitious, unscrupulous, selfish, extravagant and ostentatious. His obligations as a king sat very lightly on him. He felt himself bound by no special duty, either to maintain the theory of royal supremacy or to follow a policy which would benefit his people. Like Richard I, he valued England primarily as a source of supplies.
::::::::::::William Stubbs, ''The Constitutional History of England''<ref>Stubbs, William. ''The Constitutional History of England'', quoted in McKisack, ''Edward III and the historians'', p. 3.</ref>}}

Influential as Stubbs was, it was long before this view was challenged. In a 1960 article, titled "Edward III and the Historians", [[May McKisack]] pointed out the [[Teleology|teleological]] nature of Stubbs' judgement. A medieval king could not be expected to work towards the future ideal of a parliamentary monarchy; rather his role was a pragmatic one<U+2014>to maintain order and solve problems as they arose. At this, Edward III excelled.<ref>McKisack, ''Edward III and the historians'', 4<U+2013>5.</ref> Edward had also been accused of endowing his younger sons too liberally and thereby promoting dynastic strife culminating in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. This claim was rejected by [[K.B. McFarlane]], who argued that this was not only the common policy of the age, but also the best.<ref>K.B. McFarlane (1981). ''England in the fifteenth century'', London: Hambledon Press, p. 238. ISBN 0-9506882-5-8.</ref> Later biographers of the king such as Mark Ormrod and [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]] have followed this historiographical trend. However, the older negative view has not completely disappeared; as recently as 2001, [[Norman Cantor]] described Edward III as an "avaricious and sadistic thug" and a "destructive and merciless force."<ref>Cantor, ''In the Wake of the Plague'', 37, 39.</ref>

From what we know of Edward's character, he could be impulsive and temperamental, as was seen by his actions against Stratford and the ministers in 1340/41.<ref>Prestwich, ''Plantagenet England'', 289.</ref> At the same time, he was well-known for his clemency; Mortimer's [[Roger de Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March|grandson]] was not only absolved, but came to play an important part in the French wars, and was eventually made a knight of the Garter.<ref>McKisack, ''Fourteenth Century'', 255.</ref> Both in his religious views and his interests, he was a conventional man. His favourite pursuit was the art of war, and, as such, he conformed to the medieval notion of good kingship.<ref>Ormrod, ''Reign of Edward III'', 44; Prestwich, ''Plantagenet England'', 290<U+2013>1.</ref>  As a warrior he was so successful that one modern military historian has described him as the greatest general in English history.<ref>Clifford J. Rogers, "England's Greatest General," MHQ SUMMER 2002, VOL: 14 NO: 4</ref> He seems to have been unusually devoted to his wife, [[Philippa of Hainault|Queen Philippa]]. Much has been made of Edward's sexual licentiousness, but there is no evidence of any infidelity on the king's part before [[Alice Perrers]] became his lover, and, by that time, the queen was already terminally ill.<ref>Mortimer, ''Perfect King'', 400<U+2013>1; Prestwich, ''Three Edwards'', 241.</ref> He is quite unusual among medieval English monarchs in having no known illegitimate children. This devotion extended to the rest of the family as well; in contrast to so many of his predecessors, Edward never experienced opposition from any of his five adult sons.<ref>Prestwich, ''Plantagenet England'', 290.</ref>

==Fictional portrayals==
Edward is the central character in the play ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'', sometimes attributed to [[William Shakespeare]]. He also appears as a boy in ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' by [[Christopher Marlowe]]. Edward is also the protagonist of [[William Blake]]'s early drama ''Edward the Third'', part of his ''[[Poetical Sketches]]'', published in 1783.  [[George Bernard Shaw]] portrayed Edward for dramatic purposes as, in Shaw's preface to ''The Six of Calais'', ''behaving himself like an unrestrained human being in a very trying situation''.

Edward III has rarely been portrayed on screen. He was portrayed by [[Charles Kent (actor)|Charles Kent]] in the 1911 silent short ''The Death of King Edward III'' and by [[Michael Hordern]] in the 1955 film ''[[The Dark Avenger]]'', about Edward, the Black Prince. As a boy he has been portrayed by [[St<U+00E9>phane Combesco]] in the 1982 French TV adaptation of Marlowe's play and by [[Jody Graber]] in [[Derek Jarman]]'s [[Edward II (film)|1991 version]].

Although he did not appear in the film, Edward is stated to be the son of Isabella and the Scottish rebel, [[William Wallace]], in the film ''[[Braveheart]]''. This is impossible, as Wallace died 7 years before Edward was born when Isabella was about 10 years old. It is extremely unlikely William Wallace and Isabella ever met.

Edward appears in the [[Bernard Cornwell]] novel ''[[Harlequin (novel)|Harlequin]]'' and in [[Maurice Druon|Maurice Druon's]] series of historical novels ''[[The Accursed Kings]]''. Actor [[Aur<U+00E9>lien Wiik]] played him in the 2005 French TV series adaptation of these novels.

Edward also appears in the Owen Archer mystery novel "The Lady Chapel" of [[Candace Robb]].

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Arms===
Like his father and grandfather before him, Edward's arms as heir-apparent were differenced by a label azure of three points, which he lost when he acceded the throne.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]</ref>. Part-way through his reign, in 1340, he altered those arms by quartering them with those of France, to signal his claim thereto.

==Family tree==
Edward was a descendant of [[Henry II of England]] by his son [[John of England]] as was his mother [[Isabella of France|Isabella]] by Henry's daughter [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]]. His relationship to the French Royal [[House of Capet]] is shown in the simplified family tree below. His line of descent from [[William the Conqueror]] can be seen at the [[English monarchs family tree]].
