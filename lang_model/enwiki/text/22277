'''Lionel Charles Hamilton Palairet''' (27 May 1870&nbsp;<U+2013> 27 March 1933) was an English [[History of English amateur cricket|amateur]] [[cricket|cricketer]] who played for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]]. A graceful right-handed batsman, he was selected to play [[Test cricket]] for [[England cricket team|England]] twice in 1902. Contemporaries judged Palairet to have one of the most attractive batting styles of the period. His obituary in ''The Times'' described him as "the most beautiful batsman of all time".<ref name=timesobit>The Times, Wednesday, Mar 29, 1933; pg. 6; Issue 46405; col D</ref> An unwillingness to tour during the English winter limited Palairet's Test appearances; contemporaries believed he deserved more [[Cricket cap|Test caps]].

Palairet was educated at [[Repton School]]. He played in the school cricket team for four years, as captain in the latter two, before going to [[Oriel College, Oxford]]. He achieved his cricketing [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] in each of his four years at Oxford, and captained the side in 1892 and 1893. For Somerset, he frequently opened the batting with [[Herbie Hewett]]. In 1892, [[Partnership (cricket)|they shared a partnership]] of 346 for the first wicket, an opening stand that set a record for the County Championship and remains Somerset's highest first-wicket partnership.{{efn|As of September 2013. |name="asof"}} In that season, Palairet was named as one of the "[[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Five Batsmen of the Year]]" by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]''.

Over the following decade, he was one of the leading amateur batsmen in England. He passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season on seven occasions, and struck two double centuries. His highest score, 292 runs against [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1895, remained a record for a Somerset batsman until 1948. His only Test matches were the fourth and fifth Tests against Australia in 1902: Australia won the fourth Test by three runs, and England won the fifth Test by one wicket. After 1904, he appeared infrequently for Somerset, though he played a full season in 1907 when he was chosen to captain the county. He retired from first-class cricket in 1909, having scored over 15,000 runs.

==Early life==
Lionel Palairet was born in [[Grange-over-Sands]], a popular [[seaside resort]] in [[Lancashire]], on 27 May 1870.<ref name="whoswho">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U215105 |title=Palairet, Lionel Charles Hamilton |work=Who Was Who.

Some of Palairet's early success can be attributed to his father, who paid the professionals [[Frederick Martin (cricketer)|Frederick Martin]] and [[William Attewell]], both later [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year]], to bowl at his two sons during the Easter holidays, to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season.<ref name="bailys"/> During the later part of the 1889 season, Palairet made his first appearances for [[Somerset County Cricket Club]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/260/Miscellaneous_Matches.html |title=Miscellaneous Matches played by Lionel Palairet (45) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> At the time, Somerset were a second-class county, and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second-class opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/4/Other_matches_in_England_1889.html |title=Other matches in England 1889 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> Although a Lancastrian by birth, Palairet's family home was at [[Cattistock]] in [[Dorset]], and it was in the south west that he chose to play his cricket.<ref name="bailys">{{cite journal |url=http://archive.org/stream/bailysmagazines29unkngoog#page/n379/mode/2up |title=Mr. Lionel Charles Hamilton Palairet |journal=Baily's Magazine of Sports and Pastimes |publisher=Vinton |location=London |volume=LXXV |issue=495 |year=1901 |month=May |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> On completion of his studies at Repton, he attended [[Oriel College, Oxford]].<ref name="whoswho"/>

==Cricket career==

===University and county cricketer===
Palairet was selected for the [[Oxford University Cricket Club|university cricket team]] during his first year at Oxford, and made his first-class debut against the touring [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] in May 1890.<ref name="fcm">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/260/First-Class_Matches.html |title=First-Class Matches played by Lionel Palairet (267) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> Palairet scored six and nought and took one wicket in the match which Australia won by an innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3544.html |title=Oxford University v Australians: Australia in England 1890 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> In his next match, Palairet improved, top-scoring for Oxford in their first innings against the [[Gentlemen v Players|Gentlemen]] with his first half-century in first-class cricket, 54 runs batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number eight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3550.html |title=Oxford University v Gentlemen of England: University Match 1890 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> He only passed 50 runs in one other innings for Oxford that summer, a score of 72 against the MCC,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3586.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Oxford University: University Match 1890 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> and in all matches for the university that season scored 285 runs at an average of 19.00.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/ENG/1890_f_Batting_by_Average.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding in England for 1890 (Ordered by Average) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> Batting averages in 1890 were lower than usual due to the poor weather, and Palairet's average placed him fourth among Oxford's team; his 285-run total was the team's second highest aggregate. Palairet won his [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]]<U+2014>the awarding of the Oxford "colours" to sportsmen<U+2014>by appearing in the 1890 [[The University Match (cricket)|University match]] against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge]], a game in which he had little success.<ref>Bolton (1962), pp. 133<U+2013>135.</ref> Somerset  played thirteen matches in the season,  won twelve of them and [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tied]] the other. Palairet played in ten of these games, and on his first appearance scored a [[Century (cricket)|century]] against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]]. Somerset's achievements led to their admission to first-class cricket for 1891.<ref name="bailys"/>

Oxford's batting was described by the Oxford cricket historian Geoffrey Bolton as "unreliable" during 1891, Palairet's second year at the university. Palairet's batting average of 15.78 placed him fifth amongst his peers, and he once again struggled in the University match, scoring two and eleven.<ref>Bolton (1962), pp. 136<U+2013>139.</ref> Although he generally batted as part of the middle order for Oxford, he invariably opened the innings for Somerset alongside his captain, [[Herbie Hewett]].

In 1892 Palairet was elected captain of the Oxford team, and according to ''[[Wisden Cricketers Almanack|Wisden]]'', "had a most brilliant season."<ref name="coty"/> Palairet used himself heavily as a bowler for the university; only [[George Berkeley (cricketer)|George Berkeley]] bowled more deliveries.<ref name="Bolton1892">Bolton (1962), pp. 140<U+2013>144.</ref> He took five wickets in an innings for the first of two occasions during his career in the first innings of Oxford's match against the Gentlemen,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3795.html |title=Oxford University v Gentlemen of England: University Match 1892 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> and followed it up with four wickets in each innings against Lancashire, a match in which he also scored a half-century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3802.html |title=Oxford University v Lancashire: University Match 1892 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> He recorded the best bowling figures of his first-class career in the return match against Lancashire, taking six wickets for 84 runs at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3824.html |title=Lancashire v Oxford University: University Match 1892 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> and in the following game against Sussex, Bolton says, "Palairet played two beautiful innings and bowled to some effect".<ref name="Bolton1892"/> Facing Cambridge in the University match, he was out without scoring in the first innings, but centuries from [[Malcolm Jardine]] and [[Vernon Hill]] took Oxford to 365. Cambridge were dismissed for 160, and were forced to [[follow on]], whereupon they reached 388, leaving Oxford requiring 184 runs to win. Palairet, who had injured himself while fielding, opted not to open the batting, promoting [[Frank Phillips (cricketer)|Frank Phillips]] in his place. Oxford started poorly, falling to 17 for two, but coming in at number five, Palairet batted for an hour and a half to score 71 runs and help his side to victory. He topped the batting averages for Oxford in 1892, scoring 509 runs at 36.35, and his 28 wickets came at 22.28.<ref name="Bolton1892"/>

Palairet's university performances were good enough to earn him selection for [[Gentlemen v Players|the Gentlemen against the Players]] in the prestigious matches at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] and [[The Oval]].<ref name="fcm"/> Returning to Somerset, he struck a century against Gloucestershire in early July,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3842.html |title=Gloucestershire v Somerset: County Championship 1892 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> In late August, playing [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]], Palairet scored 132 out of a partnership of 346 with Hewett,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3881.html |title=Somerset v Yorkshire: County Championship 1892 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> establishing a record for the first wicket in first-class cricket, surpassing [[W.

In contrast to the previous year, 1893 was an unsuccessful one for Oxford. The university side failed to win a single match, and despite favourable batting conditions, none of the batsmen scored a century. Palairet was second in the batting averages, scoring 276 runs at 21.23. Bolton questioned the team selections that year under Palairet's captaincy, particularly for the University match, in which he believed a stronger team could have been chosen.<ref name="Bolton1893">Bolton (1962), pp. 144<U+2013>147.</ref> Cambridge had a powerful team, containing eight of their players from the previous year, and adding [[Arthur Jones (cricketer)|Arthur Jones]] and [[K. S. Ranjitsinhji]]. Oxford lost the match by 266 runs, with only Palairet and Fry scoring more than 12 runs for the side.<ref>Chesterton, Doggart (1989), p. 114.</ref> 

In his four years at Oxford, Palairet appeared for the university 31 times in first-class cricket and accrued 1,291 runs at an average of 23.05. He scored nine half-centuries, with a top-score of 75 [[not out]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/260/f_Batting_by_Team.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding For Each Team by Lionel Palairet |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> He claimed 52 wickets at 25.03<U+2014>significantly lower than his career average<U+2014>and took the only five-wicket hauls of his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/260/f_Bowling_by_Team.html |title=First-class Bowling For Each Team by Lionel Palairet |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> While at Oxford, he also gained a Blue in athletics, running in the three-mile race against Cambridge in 1892.

===Leading amateur batsman===
Over the following seasons, Palairet moved to "the front rank of amateur batsmen," according to W. G. Grace.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grace |first1=W.G. |authorlink1=W. G. Grace |title='W.G.'

The subsequent 1901 season was, statistically, his best.

===England recognition===
[[File:Lionel Palairet by Leslie Ward.jpg|right|thumb|Palairet caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1903|alt=A caricature of Palairet wearing his cricketing whites, with a light red cap and a blue jacket with white stripes.]]
The English summer of 1902 was badly affected by rain, making batting more difficult.<ref>Altham, Swanton (1938), p. 244.</ref> Through the whole season, Palairet did not score a first-class century, though he did score over 1,000 runs.<ref name="batbs"/> He was once again instrumental in inflicting defeat on Yorkshire: on what [[Sir Home Gordon, 12th Baronet|Sir Home Gordon]] described as a "rain-ruined wicket", Palairet scored 25 and 24 during a match in which only Braund also reached double-figure scores in both innings. ''Wisden'' described the pair's batting as "admirable", and it helped secure a Somerset victory by 34 runs; for the second successive year, Somerset were the only side to beat Yorkshire in the County Championship.<ref>Green (1980), pp. 279<U+2013>280.</ref>

Palairet was selected to appear for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|touring Australians]] in the week prior to the first Test of the series. He scored 39 and 44 in a drawn match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/5/5915.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Australians: Australia in British Isles 1902 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> He was not chosen to play in any of the first three Tests, but was called up for the fourth match, at Old Trafford. Palairet, Ranjitsinhji and [[Fred Tate]] replaced Fry, [[George Hirst]] and [[Gilbert Jessop]]; the ''Wisden'' match report indicates that dropping Fry was a necessary decision, but that Hirst and Jessop should both have played.<ref name="Green2932">Green (1980), pp. 29<U+2013>32.</ref> In ''A History of Cricket'', Altham is more direct in claiming that Palairet should not have been chosen: "The selectors, it is now agreed, made a questionable choice in preferring Lionel Palairet to an all-rounder such as Hirst."<ref>Altham, Swanton (1938), p. 245.</ref> On his Test debut, Palairet opened the batting and scored six runs in the first innings, one of five victims to fall to [[Jack Saunders]] and [[Hugh Trumble]] in the first 45 minutes of England's innings. In the second innings, Palairet once again opened, though with a different partner: MacLaren replaced [[Bobby Abel]]. The pair made scored 44 runs together, though ''Wisden'' noted that "the difficulty they experienced in playing the bowling made one apprehensive". Palairet was bowled by Saunders, and England were eventually dismissed for 120, four runs short of victory.<ref name="Green2932"/>

For the next Test match<U+2014>the fifth and final  of the series<U+2014>Palairet retained his place, with Hirst and Jessop  restored to the side.<ref name="Green3235">Green (1980), pp. 32<U+2013>35.</ref> The Australians batted throughout the first day  for a total of 324 runs. Overnight  rain then made batting  difficult, and England totalled  183 on the second day. Palairet was dismissed for 20 by Trumble, whose bowling Altham praised as magnificent.<ref>Altham, Swanton (1938), pp. 246<U+2013>247.</ref>  Australia  also struggled in their second innings, and  England required 263 runs to win the match. Palairet was dismissed for six, the third batsman to be bowled by Trumble in the innings, at which point England's score was 10 for 3 wickets. Lower order runs from the recalled Jessop and Hirst recovered the innings, and England won by one wicket.<ref name="Green3235"/> In Palairet's only other match against Australia that summer,  for Somerset, he scored 44 and 90 in a drawn game at Taunton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6015.html |title=Somerset v Australians: Australia in British Isles 1902 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> He made no further Test appearances, and completed his brief Test career with 49 runs at an average of 12.25,<ref name="caprof">{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/260/260.html |title=Player Profile: Lionel Palairet |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> against an Australian side that has been described as among the best Test teams prior to the Second World War.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20111002/sports/sports8.html |title=The greatest team of all time |work=The Gleaner |publisher=Gleaner Company |last=Becca |first=Tony |date=2 October 2011 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>

===Later county career===
In 1903, Palairet played eleven first-class matches. His only century of the season came against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]], when he scored 114  in the second innings, having struck a half-century in the first.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6341.html |title=Somerset v Surrey: County Championship 1903 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref> He passed 50 on three other occasions, and finished the year with 637 runs at 35.38.<ref name="batbs"/> He appeared more frequently the following year, in which he scored 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the final time of his career.<ref name="batbs"/> He opened the season with a century against Gloucestershire, scoring 166 runs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6417.html |title=Gloucestershire v Somerset: County Championship 1904 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref> During the Bath cricket festival, he scored 111, and shared an opening partnership of 161 with Braund during a ten-wicket loss to Lancashire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6460.html |title=Somerset v Lancashire: County Championship 1904 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref> Against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] later that month, he scored the second, and final, first-class double century of his career. Opening the batting for Somerset, he reached 203; more than Worcestershire had managed in their first innings, before being dismissed. Somerset won the match by an innings and 114 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/6/6493.html |title=Worcestershire v Somerset: County Championship |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref> The cricket historian David Foot describes 1904 and the subsequent few seasons as undistinguished for Somerset;<ref name="Foot79">Foot (1986), p. 79.</ref> between then and the First World War, the club never finished higher than tenth in the County Championship.<ref>Foot (1986), p. 218.</ref> Palairet missed most of the cricket in 1905 and 1906, to concentrate on his work as a [[land agent]] for the [[Earl of Devon]].<ref name="Foot79"/> He played three times in 1905; against the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1905|touring Australians]], [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]], while in 1906 he played one match, against Yorkshire.<ref name="fcm"/> At the end of 1906, Woods, who had captained Somerset since 1894, retired. Despite his limited appearances over the previous couple of years, Palairet was appointed as Woods' replacement for 1907.<ref name="Foot8284">Foot (1986), pp. 82<U+2013>84.</ref>

During the 1907 season, Palairet played in all of Somerset's County Championship matches, and also appeared for the county against the [[South African cricket team in England in 1907|touring South African side]]. The club struggled to find eleven eligible players for some of their matches, and at one stage were forced to recall [[Ted Tyler]] to the side <U+2013> Tyler had not played for Somerset for four years, and had only played five matches since 1900.<ref name="Foot8284"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/208/First-Class_Matches.html |title=First-Class Matches played by Ted Tyler (185) |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> Palairet himself had a disappointing year; his batting average of 21.33 was the lowest in any season in which he played ten or more matches. He passed 50 in an innings on only three occasions,<ref name="batbs"/> one of these being 116 runs against Kent at [[Angel Ground|Tonbridge]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/7/7236.html |title=Kent v Somerset: County Championship 1907 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> the final century of his first-class career.<ref name="batbs"/> At the end of the season, in which Somerset finished fourteenth of sixteen teams in the County Championship, Palairet resigned the captaincy.

Often considered by commentators to be the benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hGQOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA119&dq=Yorkshire+lost+two+Palairet#v=onepage&q=Palairet&f=false |title=Background of Cricket |author=[[Sir Home Gordon, 12th Baronet|Gordon, Sir Home]] |year=1939 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |page=60}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Great Cricketers |editor-last=Batchelor |editor-first=Denzil |year=1970 |publisher=Eyre & Spottiswoode (Publishers) Ltd |isbn=0-413-26510-2 |page=44}}</ref> In his book, ''[[The Jubilee Book of Cricket]]'', Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots, and describes his methods in places, using them as the model which young players should adopt.<ref>Ranjitsinhji (1897), pp. 53, 151, 157, 185, 301.</ref> He played predominantly off the front foot,{{efn|A batsman is said to "play off the front foot" when their weight is over their front foot; which the one furthest from the stumps, and closest to the bowler.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bXwymN30LGgC&pg=PT49#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Understanding Cricket |last=Hickey |first=Julia |isbn=1-905540-08-6 |publisher=Coachwise Limited |year=2006 |page=57}}</ref>}} and tended to be less effective on soft pitches. He favoured shots on the [[Fielding (cricket)|off side]], particularly the off drive and cover drive.<ref name="wisdenobit"/> During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as [[off theory]], of bowling the ball just outside the off [[Stump (cricket)#Part of the wicket|stump]]. The strength of Palairet's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was a key factor in limiting his range of [[Fielding (cricket)|leg side]] shots.<ref name="windsor">{{cite journal|url=http://archive.org/stream/acd6136.0006.001.umich.edu#page/156/mode/2up |title=Cricketers I Have Met |last=Fry |first=C.

For a time early in his career, he attempted to play more powerfully, but then returned to his forward style. Despite this, he remained capable of hitting the ball out of the [[County Ground, Taunton|County Ground]] in Taunton and into the [[River Tone]] at one end or the [[Church of St. James, Taunton|churchyard]] at the other.<ref name="windsor"/> Although considered a stylish batsman, Palairet was described by Foot as having "the minimum of extrovert flourish" and "no quaint mannerisms", both factors he considered relevant in Palairet's limited Test appearances. Throughout his career, Palairet shunned improvisation, and played well-establish, orthodox cricket shots. He remained absolutely still at the crease while preparing to play a shot, a feature later seen in [[Viv Richards]]' batting.<ref>Foot (1986), p. 38.</ref> 

==Personal life==
Palairet married Caroline Mabel Laverton, the daughter of William Henry Laverton, a prominent cricket patron in Wiltshire, in 1894. The pair had two children: Evelyn Mabel Hamilton, born in 1895, and Henry Edward Hamilton the following year.<ref name="hug"/> Palairet's brother, [[Richard Palairet|Richard]], played first-class cricket for Somerset between 1891 and 1902, albeit without as much success as Lionel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/230157.html |title=Obituaries in 1955 |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref> In addition to cricket, Palairet maintained an interest in a range of other sports; a 1901 profile of him in ''Baily's Magazine'' records that foxhunting was his primary sporting interest.<ref name="bailys"/> After his retirement from cricket, Palairet became a prominent [[golf]]er in the south-west. He was the first chairman of the Devon County Golf Union upon its formation in 1911, captained Devon at golf either side of the First World War, from 1914 through until 1926, and was also president of the Union from 1923 until 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devongolfunion.org.uk/past_officers |title=Past Officers |publisher=Devon County Golf Union |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> He developed the idea of an inter-club team championship within Devon, and donated the prize, which remains named the Palairet Trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devongolfunion.org.uk/history |title=History of the Union |publisher=Devon County Golf Union |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> During the First World War, he had command of a Remount Depot at [[Powderham Castle|Powderham]], the seat of the Earl of Devon.<ref name="repton"/> He died in Exmouth on 27 March 1933, aged 62.<ref name=timesobit/><ref name="wisdenobit"/>
