'''New York State Route&nbsp;82''' (NY&nbsp;82) is a [[state highway]] in the eastern [[Hudson Valley]] of [[New York]], [[United States]]. It begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 52|NY&nbsp;52]] northeast of the [[Fishkill (village), New York|village of Fishkill]], bends eastward towards [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]], and then returns westward to end at a junction with [[U.S. Route 9 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;9]], [[New York State Route 9H|NY&nbsp;9H]], and [[New York State Route 23|NY&nbsp;23]] at Bell Pond, near [[Claverack, New York|Claverack]]. NY&nbsp;82 meets the [[Taconic State Parkway]] twice; it is the only state highway that has more than one exit with the parkway.

NY&nbsp;82 was assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]]. An alternate route of NY&nbsp;82 from South Millbrook to [[Pine Plains (CDP), New York|Pine Plains]], designated as '''New York State Route&nbsp;82A''', was assigned at the same time. Part of NY&nbsp;82A was replaced by the new [[U.S. Route 44 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;44]] by 1935. The routings of NY&nbsp;82 and NY&nbsp;82A were swapped in the mid-1930s, but the change was reverted in the mid-1960s. Ownership and maintenance of NY&nbsp;82A was transferred from the state of New York to [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] in 1980, at which time it was redesignated as '''County Route&nbsp;83'''.

==Route description==
===Dutchess County===
NY 82 begins at an intersection with NY 52 in [[Brinckerhoff, New York|Brinckerhoff]]. The route proceeds to the northeast, paralleling the path of the [[Fishkill Creek]] through southern [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]]. At the [[East Fishkill, New York|East Fishkill]] hamlet of Hopewell Junction, NY 82 briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 376|NY 376]] before separating from the waterway east of the hamlet. NY 82 continues north to the community of Arthursburg, where it meets the [[Taconic State Parkway]] at an interchange. Past the exit, the two roads begin to follow parallel routings through the center of the county. To the north in [[Billings, New York|Billings]], NY 82 intersects [[New York State Route 55|NY 55]] before continuing onward toward the village of [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]]. South of Millbrook, NY 82 turns to the west at an intersection with [[New York State Route 343|NY 343]]. Midway between Millbrook and the Taconic Parkway, NY 82 meets [[U.S. Route 44 (New York)|U.S. Route 44]] and overlaps the route for a short distance to the west. The two routes separate just east of where US 44 meets the parkway.<ref name="gmaps">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=NY-82+N&daddr=NY-82+N+to:NY-82+N+to:42.174496,-73.75857&geocode=FdDreQIduNSY-w%3BFSbtewId5pea-w%3BFXr1gQIdf-ab-w%3B&hl=en&mra=dme&mrcr=1&mrsp=3&sz=17&via=1&sll=42.175975,-73.756531&sspn=0.004341,0.011362&ie=UTF8&ll=41.788721,-73.44223&spn=0.559068,1.454315&z=10 |title=Map of NY 82|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref>

[[Image:NY-82.jpg|left|thumb|NY 82 looking south, near [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]]]]
North of the split with US 44, NY 82 leaves the vicinity of the parkway and begins parallel the [[Wappinger Creek]] as it heads through the northern extent of Dutchess County. At [[Pine Plains (CDP), New York|Pine Plains]], the creek terminates while NY 82 intersects [[New York State Route 199|NY 199]] in the center of the hamlet. NY 82 turns east, forming a brief overlap with NY 199 before splitting outside of the community. Shortly after leaving NY 199, NY 82 passes into [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]].<ref name="gmaps"/>

===Columbia County===
[[Image:NY-82 2.jpg|right|thumb|Signage for NY 82 near Millbrook]]
Within Columbia County, NY 82 maintains a predominantly northwest-southeast routing. From the county line northward, NY 82 passes through [[Ancramdale, New York|Ancramdale]] and [[Ancram, New York|Ancram]] prior to meeting the Taconic Parkway a second time near the [[Lake Taghkanic State Park]] in [[West Taghkanic, New York|West Taghkanic]]. Past the Taconic, NY 82 continues onward to [[Bell Pond, New York|Bell Pond]], where it terminates at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 9 (New York)|U.S. Route 9]], [[New York State Route 9H|NY 9H]], and [[New York State Route 23|NY 23]].<ref name="gmaps"/>

==History==
===Origins and establishment===
In 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] created Route&nbsp;1, an unsigned [[legislative route]] extending from [[New York City]] to [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]]. Route&nbsp;1 left modern [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] at the [[Amenia (CDP), New York|hamlet of Amenia]] and followed what is now [[U.S. Route 44 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;44]] west to Smithfield Valley Road. From there, the route headed north through the town of [[North East, New York|North East]] and northwest through the [[Pine Plains (town), New York|town of Pine Plains]] to the [[Pine Plains (CDP), New York|community of Pine Plains]] by way of Smithfield Valley Road. Route&nbsp;1 continued northward on Silvernails and Gallatinville Roads and modern County Route&nbsp;7 to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Ancram, New York|Ancram]], where it turned northeast to follow today's CR&nbsp;7 toward [[Copake, New York|Copake]].<ref name="1909book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA53 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law  |year=1909 |publisher=J.

In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], the portion of Route&nbsp;1 between Pine Plains and Ancram became part of NY&nbsp;82, a new route extending from the vicinity of the [[Fishkill (village), New York|village of Fishkill]] in the south to the town of [[Livingston, New York|Livingston]] in the north.<ref name="gb" /><ref name="1930map">{{cite map |title=Road Map of New York |year=1930 |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company of New York]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> At the same time, the segment of old Route&nbsp;1 from Amenia to Pine Plains became part of NY&nbsp;82A, an alternate route of NY&nbsp;82 between the hamlets of South Millbrook and Pine Plains by way of Amenia.<ref name="gb">''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref>

===Realignments and maintenance transfers===
By 1935, the portions of NY&nbsp;82 and NY&nbsp;82A between Washington's Hollow and Amenia were incorporated into the new US&nbsp;44. As a result, NY&nbsp;82A was truncated to begin at US&nbsp;44 near Amenia while NY&nbsp;82 [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped US&nbsp;44 from South Millbrook to Washington's Hollow.<ref name="1935map">{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide <U+2013> New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> The routings of NY&nbsp;82 and NY&nbsp;82A between South Millbrook and Pine Plains were swapped by 1938, with the route via Amenia becoming NY&nbsp;82 and the route via [[Stanford, New York|Stanford]] becoming NY&nbsp;82A. From South Millbrook to Amenia, NY&nbsp;82 overlapped US&nbsp;44.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York Road Map for 1938 |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1938 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref>

NY&nbsp;82 has been realigned twice between Pine Plains and Ancram since its assignment. By 1935, the route was altered to bypass Gallatinville Road and continue on Silvernails Road to the hamlet of Silvernails, where it met modern County Route&nbsp;7.<ref name="1935map" /> In the early 1950s, NY&nbsp;82 was changed to exit Pine Plains to the east by way of an overlap with [[New York State Route 199|NY&nbsp;199]]. At Hammertown, the two routes split and NY&nbsp;82 continued north to Ancram by way of Ancramdale. Between Ancramdale and Ancram, NY&nbsp;82 replaced [[New York State Route 201 (1930<U+2013>1950s)|NY&nbsp;201]],<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Sunoco]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1952}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]] |edition=1955<U+2013>56 |year=1954}}</ref> a route originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering.<ref name="1930map" />

In the mid-1960s, NY&nbsp;82 and NY&nbsp;82A were restored to their ca. 1935 alignments, with NY&nbsp;82 routed through Washington's Hollow and NY&nbsp;82A beginning in Amenia.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York and Metropolitan New York |publisher=[[Sinclair Oil|Sinclair]] |year=1964 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1968 |edition=1969<U+2013>70 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> On April&nbsp;1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY&nbsp;82A was transferred from the state of [[New York]] to [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Also transferred from the state to the county was the portion of NY&nbsp;82's original routing in Pine Plains between NY&nbsp;199 and Silvernails Road.<ref name="law">{{cite web |author=[[New York State Legislature]] |url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS |title=New York State Highway Law <U+00A7> 341 |accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> Following the swap, NY&nbsp;82A was redesignated as County Route&nbsp;83 while NY&nbsp;82's former routing in Pine Plains became CR&nbsp;83A.<ref name="pine plains quad">{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=y49 |title=Pine Plains Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1989 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref>

As part of the above highway maintenance swap, the state assumed maintenance of the portion of NY&nbsp;82 from NY&nbsp;199 to the [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] line. At the same time, the state also acquired ownership of the segment of NY&nbsp;82 in Columbia County between the Dutchess County line and CR&nbsp;7 in Ancram as part of a separate swap with Columbia County. Both segments had previously been county-maintained.<ref name="law" />

NY&nbsp;82 originally entered the hamlet of South Millbrook instead of bypassing it to the west. Its former routing into the community is now County Route&nbsp;111 and known as "Old Route&nbsp;82".<ref name="millbrook quad">{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=z49 |title=Millbrook Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1989 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref>
