=== Background ===
Following the [[2007 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], the [[Formula One]] teams headed to [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] for a three-day test. Nine teams participated, with the exception of [[Honda Racing F1|Honda]] and [[Super Aguri F1|Super Aguri]], who opted to test at the [[Circuito Permanente de Jerez|Jerez circuit]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Honda, Super Aguri kick off Jerez test |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/59981 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref> Neither [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] nor [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]] were fastest on the first two days at Silverstone, rather it was [[Toyota F1|Toyota]] that was fastest on both of the days.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Beer |title=Ralf leads first day of Silverstone test |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/59977 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Trulli keeps Toyota on top at Silverstone |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/59992 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-20 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref> However, on the third and final day of testing [[Felipe Massa]] put Ferrari on top with a time of 1:20.805.

Off track Ferrari launched a [[2007 Formula One espionage controversy|criminal investigation]] in [[Modena]] against their own employee [[Nigel Stepney]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |coauthors=Biranit Goren |title=Ferrari's Stepney faces criminal enquiry |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60025 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref> Stepney's lawyer ruled out sabotage claims,<ref>{{cite news |first=Michele |last=Lostia |coauthors=Jonathan Noble |title=Stepney lawyer rules out sabotage claims |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60078 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-23 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref> and Stepney said it was part of a "dirty tricks" campaign.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Stepney says he has done nothing wrong |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60114 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-24 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref>

There was also controversy at the rear-end of the grid, as [[Spyker F1|Spyker]] asked the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) to look at the new updates that were put on the Super Aguri at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]] to see whether the Aguri team are receiving current Honda parts.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Spyker want FIA to look at Aguri updates |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60247 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref> On Saturday, Super Aguri's managing director Daniel Audetto said "We have rules <U+2013> they [Spyker] can just protest.

=== Practice ===
Ferrari dominated both practice sessions on the Friday, with R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen fastest in the first Practice Session and [[Felipe Massa]] was fastest in the second Practice Session. Behind the Ferraris, Alonso was third in his McLaren, but seven tenths behind, with his team-mate and World Championship leader [[Lewis Hamilton]] sixth, but lost nearly an hour of the session due to car trouble. The two McLarens were split by [[David Coulthard]] and [[Nico Rosberg]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Ferrari dominate first practice <U+2013> France |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60245 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref>

Hamilton managed to recover from his morning trouble to post the fourth fastest time in the second Practice Session on Friday afternoon. The Ferraris were still leading, but Massa was fastest, just 0.035 seconds ahead of R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen. However, one of the major surprises came from [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]], as [[Scott Speed]] posted the third quickest time, with [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]] posting the fifth quickest time. During the session, Liuzzi was involved in a bizarre incident with [[Anthony Davidson]]; Davidson exited his garage, and smashed his Super Aguri into the side of Liuzzi's Toro Rosso; knocking his front wing off in the accident.<ref>{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Cooper |coauthors=Jonathan Noble |title=Davidson blames tight pitlane for crash |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60290 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Alonso finished the second practice session eighth.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Ferrari stay on top in practice 2 <U+2013> France |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60260 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref>

In the final practice session on Saturday morning, Hamilton managed to beat Ferrari, with the Englishman ahead of second-placed Massa by 0.063 seconds. Hamilton and the two Ferraris completed the top three, but Alonso was again down in eighth, having missed nearly the whole of the session with a faulty brake sensor.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Glendenning |title=Minor setback for Alonso in practice |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60321 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref> The [[Renault F1|Renaults]] sparked a return to form with [[Heikki Kovalainen]] and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] fourth and fifth, both ahead of rivals BMW, who were sixth and fifteenth respectively.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Beer |title=Hamilton fastest in third practice <U+2013> France |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60318 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref>

=== Qualifying ===
Both [[Spyker F1|Spykers]] and both [[Super Aguri F1|Super Aguris]] were knocked out of the first phase of qualifying, along with [[Alexander Wurz]]'s [[Williams F1|Williams]] and [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]]'s Toro Rosso. For Super Aguri's [[Takuma Sato]], it did not matter where he qualified, as he was docked ten places, due to overtaking [[Jenson Button]] under yellow flags at the last Grand Prix.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Davidson frustrated by pitlane woes |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60343 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Spykers [[Adrian Sutil]] was hoping for a wet race after an unspectacular qualifying.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Sutil relying on rain to move up |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60330 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> At the front end of the grid, the McLarens were first and fourth, with Hamilton on top, and the Ferraris splitting them in third and fourth. [[Heikki Kovalainen]] rounded out the top five.

[[David Coulthard]] failed to complete a single timed lap in the second part of qualifying due to a gearbox problem, and started sixteenth.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Coulthard rues reliability issues |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60335 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Both [[Honda F1|Hondas]] were knocked out also, along with [[Mark Webber]], [[Scott Speed]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]]. Both [[Jenson Button|Button]] and [[Rubens Barrichello|Barrichello]] were happier with the upgraded Honda, with Button saying "the car is certainly better than the last race in Indianapolis, although the positions don't reflect that".<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Drivers say upgraded Honda is a step forward |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60350 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Hamilton was again fastest in Part two, with team-mate Alonso down in fifth. Massa, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen and [[Robert Kubica|Kubica]] rounded out the top four.

After topping the first two parts of qualifying, Hamilton dropped to second in the third and final part, with Massa taking pole position, just 0.070 ahead of the Englishman. Massa stated in the post-Qualifying press conference that "it looks like we [Ferrari] are back and fighting",<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Massa delighted with return to form |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60325 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> with Hamilton believing pole was possible had he not made a mistake at Turn 15.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Hamilton believes pole was possible |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60329 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen qualified third as he lost time on one corner, which he called "all my fault".<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Raikkonen: error cost me front row slot |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60332 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-06-30 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Alonso was unable to complete a single lap in the session due to a gearbox problem.

Three people were killed in a helicopter crash at the circuit on Saturday night. They were [[Emmanuel Longobardi]], a PR operative; the pilot Pierre Bennehard; and Simon MacGill, a New Zealand national. A Bridgestone employee and his niece were injured.<ref>{{cite news |title=Three dead after helicopter crash |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60377 |work=Autosport |publisher=Haymarket|date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Bridgestone employee injured in air crash |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60389 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Longobardi was a popular member of the [[Formula One]] Paddock.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Cooper |title=Emmanuel Longobardi: 1970<U+2013>2007 |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60453 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-03 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref>

[[Adrian Sutil]] in the Spyker opted to start from the pitlane. Massa got off to the best possible start and retained his lead, but R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen passed Hamilton into Turn One. At the back of the field, [[Anthony Davidson]] hit the back of [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]]'s [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]]. The Toro Rosso came back onto the track and smashed into the side of the [[Super Aguri F1|Super Aguri]]. Liuzzi said afterwards that "all we can do is wait for Silverstone and hope that the definite improvement we have made with the car pays off".<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Liuzzi laments early exit |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60391 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> At the Adelaide hairpin, [[Jarno Trulli]] rammed into the back of [[Heikki Kovalainen]]. Trulli was out, but Kovalainen continued at the back of the field. Trulli apologised to Kovalainen after the race, and declared it "a racing accident".<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Trulli apologises to Kovalainen |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60393 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> The tangle promoted Alonso up to eighth.

[[Robert Kubica]] was quickly losing ground on the two [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferraris]] and Hamilton. Alonso passed [[Nico Rosberg|Rosberg]] for seventh, and quickly closed in on [[Nick Heidfeld|Heidfeld]], but stayed behind him until he pitted on Lap 16. Alonso attempted to get past on Lap&nbsp;five, but ran wide, giving the position back to the German. Hamilton also pitted on Lap 16, with Massa pitting on Lap 19 and R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen on Lap 21.

R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen decreased Massa's lead back down from four&nbsp;seconds to two&nbsp;seconds. Alonso passed both Heidfeld and [[Giancarlo Fisichella|Fisichella]] in the middle section of the race. In the second round of stops, R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen pitted two laps after Massa. These two laps extra gave R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen the lead after his second stop, with Massa now second. Alonso pitted for the second time on lap 35. Heidfeld and Fisichella pitted several laps later, and both of them got out in front of Alonso. [[Christijan Albers]] had an unusual accident, his car left the pit lane with the fuel rig attached without being detached by the pit crews.  Eventually, he drove to the side of the track and retired.

R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen won the race from team-mate Massa, with Hamilton third. This marked Ferrari's first one-two of the season. Massa stated that the race win was lost "because of traffic",<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Massa says backmarkers cost him win |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60386 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> while team-mate R<U+00E4>ikk<U+00F6>nen stated he was "much happier with the car", as he became the first Finn to win the race.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Raikkonen aims to keep momentum going |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60387 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Kubica was a lonely fourth, with Fisichella, Heidfeld, Alonso and [[Jenson Button|Button]] rounding out the points.<ref>{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Beer |title=Raikkonen leads Ferrari 1<U+2013>2 in France |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60384 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Despite it being Button's first points of 2007, he said that he was "not getting too excited about it".<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Noble |title=Button not too excited despite first point |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60390 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> Despite finishing seventh, Alonso was still confident about his title chances, saying that he hoped the "two points are important at the end of the season".<ref>{{cite news |first=Pablo |last=Elizalde |title=Alonso still confident about title chances |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/60385 |publisher=Autosport.com |date=2007-07-01 |accessdate=2007-07-06 }}</ref>
