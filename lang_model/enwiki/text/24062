I feel fortunate to be at Ohio State. I love being here. We want to be the best we can every day."</ref> Groce started his coaching career as an assistant with his alma mater, [[Taylor University]], under Paul Patterson from 1993 to 1996. His next job was an assistant at [[North Carolina State University]] under [[Herb Sendek]] from 1996 to 2000.  He then moved on to [[Butler University]] to join his good friend [[Thad Matta]] and was there just one season (2000<U+2013>01). Together they then moved onto [[Xavier University (Cincinnati)|Xavier University]] where he was an assistant from 2001 to 2004, and moved again with Matta to [[Ohio State University]] as an assistant from 2004 to 2008.
