{{other people|Charles French}}

'''Charles French''' (21 October 1851 &ndash; 27 October 1925) was a politician in [[Ireland]], serving as Member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

The eldest son of [[Charles French, 3rd Baron de Freyne]] by his wife Catherine Maree, French was born before his parents' marriage on 17 May 1854 and so was not eligible to succeed to the title of [[Baron de Freyne]], which passed to his younger brother, [[Arthur French, 4th Baron de Freyne|Arthur]], in 1868. He married Constance Eleanor Chichester on 21 January 1880. 

French was elected to represent [[Roscommon (UK Parliament constituency)|County Roscommon]] in a Parliamentary by-election, 24 June 1873, and held the seat until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general election]].
