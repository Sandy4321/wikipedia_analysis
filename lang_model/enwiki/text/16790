'''Ilyas Ibrahim''' ([[Dhivehi]]: <U+0787><U+07A8><U+078D><U+07B0><U+0794><U+07A7><U+0790><U+07B0> <U+0787><U+07A8><U+0784><U+07B0><U+0783><U+07A7><U+0780><U+07A8><U+0789><U+07B0> ) (born [[December 18]], [[1945]]) is the current [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Laamu Atoll]] and brother-in-law of ex-President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom]]. He also served as the MP for [[Mal<U+00E9>]] from 1980 to 1995.

==Background==
His sister [[Nasreena Ibrahim]] has been the First Lady of the Maldives since 1977. His brother [[Abbas Ibrahim]] was the speaker of the Maldivian Parliament, was also a former minister. According to critics of nepotism in Gayyoom's government, the Endherimaage brothers were given such posts not because they were qualified for it but because of Nasreena Ibrahim's power as a First Lady. {{Fact|date=April 2007}}

In 1993 when Ilyas Ibrahim became Gayoom's only principal rival for the presidency election, he was subsequently tried in absentia for violation of the constitution, found guilty of treason and sentenced to more than 15 years banishment.<ref>[http://www.ipu.org/hr-e/158/158mld2.htm Human rights of parliamentarians<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
