'''Gerald Eugene Sloan''', better known as '''Jerry Sloan''' (born [[March 28]] [[1942]]), is an [[United States|American]] [[National Basketball Association]] coach. He is one of professional [[basketball]]'s most successful coaches, with a career regular-season win<U+2013>loss record of 1086<U+2013>717 (as of the end of the 2007<U+2013>08 NBA season), placing him fourth on the list of all-time most-winning NBA coaches. Sloan collected his 1,000th career win against the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in a 101-79 victory, which made him only the fifth coach in NBA history to surpass this milestone.  After [[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom Kelly]] stepped down as manager of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in [[2001]], Sloan became the longest tenured head coach in major league sports with a single franchise. The 2007-08 season will be his 20th at the helm of the Jazz.

==Personal Life==

He married his high school sweetheart, Bobbye Sloan.  They had three children and were married 41 years.  After a well publicized six year battle against breast cancer, she died of pancreatic cancer in 2004. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1824471]  In 2006, he married Tammy Jessop, in Salt Lake City.[http://www.121s.com/viewtopic.php?t=12837]

==Playing career==
Born and raised in [[McLeansboro, Illinois|McLeansboro]], [[Illinois]], Sloan played [[college basketball]] at the [[University of Evansville]]. He was the leading scorer for the Purple Aces in each of his three seasons as a starter, amassing 15.5 points per contest. He led the college twice to the NCAA Division II Tournament and was voted a second team All-American during his senior season.

Sloan was originally selected in the third round of the [[1964 NBA Draft]] by the [[Baltimore Bullets]]. He decided to stay in college, and was then selected by the Bullets again in the [[1965 NBA Draft]] with the sixth overall pick.  He played just one season for the Bullets, then went on to play for the [[Chicago Bulls]] during the Bulls' formative years. He was the first player selected by the Bulls in the expansion draft, earning him the nickname "The Original Bull." Sloan was known for his tenacity on defense, and led the expansion team to the playoffs in its first season. 

Sloan enjoyed a good NBA career, playing in two All-Star Games, being named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team four times and the All-Defensive Second team twice. He also led the Bulls to the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] on various occasions and helped them to win one [[1974-75 NBA season|division title]], the only one the franchise has earned outside the Michael Jordan era.  Sloan averaged 9.1 rebounds per game in his second season, and his career rebounding average of 7.4 rebounds per game is unusually high for a guard. He is currently fourth on the Bulls' all-time scoring list. Sloan recorded two [[triple double]]s during his career, and scored a career-high 43 points in a 1969 game versus the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. 

A hard-nosed contract negotiator, Sloan earned a reputation of somewhat of a hustler while playing with the Bulls. His playing career was cut short by successive knee injuries, and he turned his attention to coaching. Because of his influential career with the Bulls, the franchise retired Sloan's No. 4 jersey, the first jersey retired by the Bulls.

==Coaching career==
Immediately after retiring, Sloan was hired by the Bulls as a scout. After one season in this role, he became an assistant coach with the team. In 1979, Sloan moved up the ranks to become head coach of the Chicago franchise. He was head coach of the Bulls for less than three seasons, winning 94 games and losing 121. He led the team to the playoffs in his second year, but was fired after a poor start during the next campaign.

After departing Chicago, Sloan became a scout for the [[Utah Jazz]] for one season. He then became coach of the [[Evansville Thunder]] of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] for the 1984 season before returning to the rank of Utah assistant. After [[Frank Layden]]'s retirement from the [[Utah Jazz]] in [[1988]] as head coach, the Jazz chose Sloan to be his successor. Sloan enjoyed a highly successful run of sixteen consecutive seasons of taking his team to the playoffs, and he has coached such players as [[Karl Malone]], [[John Stockton]], [[Jeff Hornacek]], [[Antoine Carr]], [[Tom Chambers]], [[Mark Eaton (basketball)|Mark Eaton]], and [[Jeff Malone]] during the process. 

Sloan has led the Jazz to six division championships and ten seasons with over fifty wins. He also took the Jazz to the [[NBA Finals]] twice, losing in the [[1997]] and [[1998]] championships, both times to his old team, the [[Michael Jordan]]-led Bulls. By the end of this period, he had joined [[Pat Riley]] and [[Phil Jackson]] as the only coaches with ten or more seasons winning fifty or more games.  After the retirement of long-time Jazz anchors Stockton and Malone, Sloan coached a younger group of budding stars, including [[Carlos Boozer]], [[Andrei Kirilenko (basketball)|Andrei Kirilenko]] and, later, [[Deron Williams]].

In spring of 2004, Sloan and his team were involved in a battle for the eighth spot in the NBA's western conference for that season, which would have given Sloan his seventeenth straight trip to the playoffs.  The Jazz were tied with the [[Denver Nuggets]] for the eighth and last spot of the playoffs with three games to go in the regular season. The Jazz lost these final two games, causing Sloan to miss the playoffs for the first time in eighteen seasons as Jazz coach.  After leading a young, dismantled team to an unexpected 42-40 record, he finished just behind [[Hubie Brown]] of the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in voting for the 2004 [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]], an award that he has still never won, despite his success.

After disappointing seasons in 2004-05 and 2005-06, the strong play of the Jazz in the 2006-07 season had renewed speculation from some sportswriters that Sloan would be a strong candidate for NBA Coach of the Year in 2007.  But Sloan lost the award to Sam Mitchell, coach of the Toronto Raptors, who led his team to a franchise-record-tying 47 victories and their first Atlantic Division title.  Sloan lost by 93 points, 394-301.  Third place runner up was Avery Johnson of the Dallas Mavericks with 268 points.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2847536 ESPN - Mitchell edges Sloan for coaching honor - NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Sloan and the Jazz advanced to the Western Conference finals on May 15, 2007 with a 100-87 win over the [[Golden State Warriors]]. It's the sixth time in franchise history that Utah advanced to the conference finals, all coming under Sloan.

Sloan said that he will be back to coach the Jazz next year during the 2008-2009 [[NBA]] season.
