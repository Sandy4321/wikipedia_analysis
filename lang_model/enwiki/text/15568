The '''history of Europe''' covers the people inhabiting the ''[[European continent]]'' since it was first populated in ''[[prehistoric]]'' times to the present, with the first '''''[[Homo sapiens]]''''' arriving between 45,000 and 25,000 BC.

The earliest settlers to [[Prehistoric Europe]] came during the [[paleolithic]] era. The arrival of agriculture around 7000 BC ushered in the [[neolithic age]]. [[Neolithic Europe]] lasted for 4000 years, overlapping with metal-using cultures that gradually spread throughout the continent.  Technological advances during the prehistoric age tended to arrive from the [[Middle East]], spreading gradually to the northwest. Some of the best-known civilizations of prehistoric Europe were the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]], which flourished during the [[Bronze Age]] until they [[Bronze Age collapse|collapsed]] in a short period of time around 1200 BC.[[File:Abraham Ortelius Map of Europe.jpg|thumb|right|Europe depicted by [[Antwerp]] cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1595|203x203px]]
The period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the rise of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout Asia. Northern and western Europe were dominated by the [[La T<U+00E8>ne culture]], a precursor to the [[Celts]]. Rome, a small city-state traditionally [[Founding of Rome|founded]] in 753 BC, would grow to become the [[Roman Republic]] in 509 BC and would succeed Greek culture as the dominant Mediterranean civilization. The events during the rule of [[Julius Caesar]] led to reorganization of the Republic into the [[Roman Empire]]. This empire was later divided by the emperor [[Diocletian]] into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] empires. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Germanic peoples]] of northern Europe grew in strength and repeated attacks led to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in AD 476, a date which traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]].

During the Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire survived, though modern historians refer to this state as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In Western Europe, Germanic peoples moved into positions of power in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the [[Franks]] would rise to a position of [[hegemony]] over western Europe, the [[Frankish Empire]] reaching its peak under [[Charlemagne]] around AD 800. This empire was later divided into several parts; [[West Francia]] would evolve into the [[Kingdom of France]], while [[East Francia]] would evolve into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a precursor to modern Germany. The British Isles were the site of several large-scale migrations. Native Celtic peoples had been marginalized during the period of [[Roman Britain]], and when the Romans abandoned the British Isles during the 400s, waves of Germanic [[Anglo-Saxons]] migrated to southern Britain and established a series of petty kingdoms in what would eventually develop into the [[Kingdom of England]] by AD 927. During this period, the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025<U+2013>1385)|Poland]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] were organized as well.

The [[Viking Age]], a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, dominated the period from the late 700s to the middle 1000s. Chief among the Viking states was the Empire of [[Cnut the Great]], a Danish leader who would become king of England, Denmark, and Norway. The [[Normans]], a Viking people who settled in Northern France and founded the [[Duchy of Normandy]], would have a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the [[Norman conquest of England]] to [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Southern Italy and Sicily]]. Another Scandinavian people, the [[Rus' people]], would go on to found [[Kievan Rus']], an early state which was a precursor for the modern country of Russia. As the Viking Age drew to a close, the period known as the [[Crusades]], a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back into Christian rule, began. Several [[Crusader states]] were founded in the eastern Mediterranean. These were all short-lived. The Crusaders would have a profound impact on many parts of Europe. Their [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 brought an abrupt end to the Byzantine Empire. Though it would later be re-established, it would never recover its former glory. The Crusaders would establish trade routes that would develop into the [[Silk Road]] and open the way for the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. Crusader missions to the Baltic lands would establish the [[State of the Teutonic Order]]. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberia]] for Christendom.

Eastern Europe in the [[High Middle Ages]] was dominated by the rise, and later fall, of the [[Mongol Empire]]. Led by [[Genghis Khan]], the Mongols were a group of [[steppe nomad]]s that established a decentralized empire that, at its height, extended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic seas in Europe. The Kievan Rus' state had broken up, replaced by several small warring states. In the face of the [[Mongol conquests]], many of these states paid [[tribute]] to the Mongols, becoming effective vassals. As Mongol power waned towards the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] rose to become the strongest of the numerous Russian principalities and republics and would itself grow into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1547. The [[Late Middle Ages]] represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In Scandinavia, the [[Kalmar Union]] dominated the political landscape, while England fought with Scotland in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and with France in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In Central Europe, the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian union]] became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman Empire, which was an [[elective monarchy]], came to be dominated by the [[House of Habsburg]], who would turn it into a hereditary position in all but name. Russia continued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands as well. In the Balkans, the [[Ottoman Empire]], a Turkish state originating in [[Anatolia]], encroached steadily on former Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.

Beginning roughly in the 14th century in [[Florence]], and later spreading through Europe with the development of the [[printing press]], a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology, with the rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] sundered the English Church, allying in ensuing religious wars between German and Spanish rulers. The [[Reconquista]] of Portugal and Spain led to a series of oceanic explorations resulting in the [[Age of Discovery]] that established direct links with Africa, the Americas, and Asia, while religious wars continued to be fought in Europe,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/population_30YW.htm |title=Thirty Years War |publisher=Historylearningsite.co.uk |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> which ended in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The [[Spanish crown]] maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on the continent until the signing of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], which ended a conflict between Spain and France that had begun during the Thirty Years' War.  An unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place around Europe and indeed the world in the period between 1610 and 1700. Observers at the time, and many historians since, have argued that wars caused the revolutions.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, "States Make War But Wars Also Break States,"''Journal of Military History'' (2010) 74#1 pp 11<U+2013>34</ref>

Political change in continental Europe was spurred by the [[French Revolution]] under the motto ''[[libert<U+00E9>, <U+00E9>galit<U+00E9>, fraternit<U+00E9>]]''. The ensuing French leader, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], conquered and enforced reforms through war up to 1815.

The period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. In France and the United Kingdom, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]] activity developed. The last vestiges of [[serfdom]] were abolished in [[Serfdom in Russia|Russia]] in 1861,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O48-serf.html |title=Serf | work=A Dictionary of World History |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> and [[Balkan]] nations began to regain independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Germany and Italy unified into nation states, and most European states had become [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] by 1871. Rivalry in a scramble for empires spread. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] was precipitated by a series of struggles among the [[Great Powers]]. War and poverty triggered the [[Russian Revolution]] which led to the formation of the [[communism|communist]] [[Soviet Union]]. Hard conditions imposed on Germany by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Great Depression]] led to the rise of [[fascism]] in Germany as well as in Italy, Spain, and other countries. The rise of [[irredentist]] regimes such as [[Nazi Germany]] led to a [[Second World War]].

Following the end of the Second World War, Europe was divided by the [[Iron Curtain]]. The Central-East was dominated by communist countries under the Soviet Union's economic and military leadership, while the rest was dominated by capitalist countries under the economic and military leadership of the United States. Both of the leading countries were superpowers. Most non-communist European countries came under US protection via [[NATO]] and formed the [[European Economic Community]] amongst themselves. Portugal, belonging to the part of Europe led by the US, remained linked to the idea of the [[socialist state]]; socialist parties also governed other countries in the West and North of Europe from time to time. There were also a number of neutral countries in Europe, including Finland, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Ireland, Austria and Switzerland. In late 1989, the Fall of Communism began in countries allied with the USSR: Poland, Hungary and Romania. The Soviet Union itself fell a little later, in 1990<U+2013>1991, and countries which had been Soviet republics became independent. As a consequence Europe's economic integration deepened, the continent became depolarised and the [[European Union]] expanded to include many of the formerly communist European countries, in 2004 and 2007.

[[File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aurochs]] in [[Palaeolithic]] [[cave painting]]s in  [[Lascaux]], France.]]

''[[Homo erectus]]'' migrated from Africa to Europe before the emergence of modern humans{{reference needed|date=October 2013}}. The bones of the earliest Europeans are found in [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], dated at 1.8 million years ago. [[L<U+00E9>zignan-la-C<U+00E8>be]] in France and [[Kozarnika]] in Bulgaria are also amongst the oldest Palaeolithic sites in Europe.

The earliest appearance of [[anatomically modern humans|anatomically modern people]] in Europe has been dated to 35,000 BC, usually referred to as the Cro-Magnon man. Some locally developed transitional cultures ([[Szeletian]] in Central Europe and [[Ch<U+00E2>telperronian]] in the Southwest) use<!-- "used"? --> clearly [[Upper Palaeolithic]] technologies at very early dates.

Nevertheless, the definitive advance of these technologies is made by the [[Aurignacian]] culture. The origins of this culture can be located in what is now [[Bulgaria]] (proto-Aurignacian or [[Bachokirian]]) and Hungary (first full Aurignacian). By 35,000 BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last [[Neanderthals]] seem to have been forced to retreat during this process to the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

Around 24,000 BC two new technologies/cultures appeared in the south-western region of Europe: [[Solutrean]] and [[Gravettian]]. The Gravettian technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the Middle East, Anatolia, and the Balkans.
[[File:Neolithic expansion.svg|thumb|Map showing the Neolithic expansions from the 7th to the 5th millennium BC, including the [[Cardium Pottery|Cardium Culture]] in blue.]]
Around 16,000 BC, Europe witnessed the appearance of a new culture, known as [[Magdalenian]], possibly rooted in the old Aurignacian one. This culture soon superseded the Solutrean area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The [[Hamburg culture]] prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC.
Around 12,500 BC, the [[W<U+00FC>rm glaciation]] ended. Slowly, through the following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing the environment of prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000 BC, when it quickly evolved into two ''microlithist'' cultures: [[Azilian]] ([[Federmesser]]), in Spain and southern France, and then [[Sauveterrian]], in northern France and Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the [[Lyngby culture|Lyngby complex]] succeeded the Hamburg culture with the influence of the [[Federmesser]] group as well. Evidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the [[Balkans]]. The [[Neolithic]] reached Central Europe in the 6th millennium BC and parts of Northern Europe in the 5th and 4th millennium BC.

===Lepenski Vir <U+2013> Vin<U+010D>a <U+2013> Cucuteni cultures 7000<U+2013>2750 BC===
[[Lepenski Vir]] (<U+041B><U+0435><U+043F><U+0435><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438> <U+0412><U+0438><U+0440>, ''Lepen Whirl'') is an important [[Mesolithic]] [[archaeological site]] located in [[Serbia]] in the central [[Balkan]] [[peninsula]]. It consists of one large settlement with around ten satellite villages. The evidence suggests the first human presence in the locality around 7000 BC with the [[archaeological culture|culture]] reaching its peak between 5300 BC and 4800 BC. In 7000 BC the settlement had a population under 100, In later periods the problems of overpopulation of the original settlement became evident, This is clearly evident in the layout of the Lepenski Vir settlement. The village is well planned. All houses are built according to one complex geometric pattern.  136 buildings, settlements and altars were found in the initial excavations in 1965<U+2013>1970.
The Lepenski Vir culture were a forerunner to the [[Vin<U+010D>a-Turda<U+0219> culture]], dated to the period 5500<U+2013>4500 BC in the same area of the [[Balkans]],  during the Vin<U+010D>a era the area sustained population growth led to an unprecedented level of settlement size and density along with the population of areas that were bypassed by earlier settlers. Vin<U+010D>a settlements were considerably larger than any other contemporary European culture, in some instances surpassing the cities of the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] and early [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern Bronze Age]] a millennium later. The largest sites, more than 29 hectares, may have had populations of up to 2,500 individuals.<ref name="Chapman 1981 Population and Settlement">{{Harvnb|Chapman|1981|pp=40<U+2013>51}}.</ref>
According to [[Marija Gimbutas]], the Vin<U+010D>a culture was part of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]] <U+2013> a relatively homogeneous, peaceful and [[Matriarchy|matrifocal]] culture that occupied Europe during the Neolithic. According to this theory its period of decline was followed by an invasion of warlike, horse-riding [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] tribes from the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]].<ref name="Gimbutas">{{Harvnb|Gimbutas|1976}}.</ref>
The Vin<U+010D>a site of [[Plo<U+010D>nik (archaeological site)|Plo<U+010D>nik]] has produced the earliest example of copper tools in the world. Copper ores were mined on a large scale at sites like [[Rudna Glava (archaeological site)|Rudna Glava]], but only a fraction were smelted and cast into metal artefacts <U+2013> and these were ornaments and trinkets rather than functional tools, which continued to be made from [[Lithic reduction|chipped stone]], bone and antler. It is likely that the primary use of mined ores was in their powdered form, in the production of pottery or as bodily decoration.<ref name="Chapman 1981 Village Crafts and Industry".<ref>Haarmann, Harald: ''Geschichte der Schrift'', C. H. Beck, 2002, ISBN 3-406-47998-7, p. 20</ref>

This period is associated with the [[Vin<U+010D>a symbols]], which are conjectured to be an early form of [[proto-writing]] alongside with the [[Dispilio Tablet]] (5260 BC) from northern Greece not far from The Vinca Culture, the [[T<U+0103>rt<U+0103>ria tablets]] dating back to around 5300 BC. This means that the Vin<U+010D>a finds predate the proto-Sumerian [[pictogram|pictographic]] script from [[Uruk]] (modern [[Iraq]]), which is usually considered as the oldest known script, by more than a thousand years.
The [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] 5508<U+2013>2750 BC was the first big civilisation in Europe and among the earliest in the world. It was a late [[Neolithic]] [[archaeological civilization]]{{clarify|date=October 2012}} from the [[Carpathian Mountains]] to the [[Dniester]] and [[Dnieper]] regions in modern-day [[Romania]], Moldova, and [[Ukraine]], encompassing an area of more than {{convert|350000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26839697/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/years-ago-neolithic-optical-art-flourished/ |title=7,000 years ago, Neolithic optical art flourished |publisher=MSNBC |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref> At its peak the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture built the largest settlements in [[Neolithic Europe]], some of which had populations of up to 15,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Fulford | first = Robert | title = What we don't know can't hurt us | newspaper = National Post | location = Toronto | pages = | date = 17 March 2009 | url = http://www.robertfulford.com/2009-03-17-museums.html | issn = 1486-8008 | accessdate = 17 May 2009}}</ref> Likewise, their density was very high, with the settlements averagely spaced 3 to 4 kilometres apart.<ref name="Mallory">{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth|year= 1989|publisher= Thames and Hudson|location= London|isbn= 0-500-05052-X|oclc= 246601873}}</ref>

==Minoans and Mycenae 2700<U+2013>1100 BCE==
[[File:Tholos of Atreus.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Treasury of [[Atreus]], or Tomb of Agamemnon in Mycenae 1250 BCE]]

The first well-known literate civilization in Europe was that of the Minoans. The [[Minoan civilization]] was a [[Bronze Age]] civilization that arose on the island of [[Crete]] and flourished from approximately the 27th century BCE to the 15th century BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 |title=Ancient Crete|publisher=Oxfordbibliographiesonline.com |date=15 February 2010 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref>  It was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century through the work of the British archaeologist [[Arthur Evans]]. [[Will Durant]] referred to it as "the first link in the European chain".<ref>Durant, ''The Life of Greece'' (''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, (New York: Simon & Schuster) 1939:11.</ref>

The Minoans were replaced by the [[Mycenaean civilization]] which flourished during the period roughly between 1600 BCE, when [[Helladic]] culture in mainland Greece was transformed under influences from Minoan Crete, and 1100 BCE.  The major Mycenaean cities were [[Mycenae]] and [[Tiryns]] in Argolis, [[Pylos]] in Messenia, [[Athens]] in Attica, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] and [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenus]] in Boeotia, and [[Iolkos]] in Thessaly. In [[Crete]], the Mycenaeans occupied [[Knossos]].

Quite unlike the Minoans, whose society benefited from trade, the Mycenaeans advanced through conquest. Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior [[aristocracy]]. Around 1400 BCE, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, centre of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script (called [[Linear A]]) to write their early form of [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Linear B]].

The Mycenaean civilization perished with the [[Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze-Age civilization]] in the eastern shored of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the [[Dorian invasion]], although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well. Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after [[Helladic period#Late Helladic III (LHIII)|LH III C]], when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BCE, occurs after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BCE opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the ''[[Greek Dark Ages]]'' of traditional historiography.

==Classical antiquity==
{{Main|Classical antiquity}}

[[File:Parthenon from south.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]], an [[Ancient Athens|ancient Athenian]] Temple on the [[Acropolis]] (hill-top city) fell to Rome in 176 BC]]

The Greeks and the Romans left a legacy in Europe which is evident in European languages, [[Western philosophy|thought]], law and minds. Ancient Greece was a collection of city-states, out of which the original form of democracy developed. [[Classical Athens|Athens]] was the most powerful and developed city, and a cradle of learning from the time of [[Pericles]]. Citizens' forums debated and legislated policy of the state, and from here arose some of the most notable classical philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], the last of whom taught [[Alexander the Great]].

Through his military campaigns, the king of the kingdom of [[Macedon]], Alexander,  spread Hellenistic culture and learning to the banks of the [[River Indus]]. But the [[Roman Republic]], strengthened through victory over [[Carthage]] in the [[Punic Wars]] was rising in the region. Greek wisdom passed into Roman institutions, as Athens itself was absorbed under the banner of the Senate and People of Rome ([[Senatus Populusque Romanus]]).

The Romans expanded from Arabia to Britannia. In 44 BC as it approached its height, its leader [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] on suspicion of subverting the Republic, to become dictator. In the ensuing turmoil, [[Octavian]] usurped the reins of power and fought the Roman Senate. While proclaiming the rebirth of the Republic, he had ushered in the transfer of the Roman state from a republic to an empire, the [[Roman Empire]], which lasted for more than four centuries until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic period}}
[[File:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Alexander Mosaic|mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] battling [[Darius III]]]]
The [[Hellenic civilisation]] was a collection of city-states or [[poleis]] with different governments and cultures that achieved notable developments in government, philosophy, science, mathematics, politics, sports, theatre and music.

The most powerful city-states were [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Athens was a powerful Hellenic city-state and governed itself with an early form of [[direct democracy]] invented by [[Cleisthenes]]; the citizens of Athens voted on legislation and executive bills themselves. Athens was the home of [[Socrates]],<ref name="enc1911">{{cite web| url = http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Socrates_%28philosopher%29| work = 1911 Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica| title = Socrates|year=1911| accessdate = 4 March 2008}}</ref> [[Plato]], and the [[Platonic Academy]].

The Hellenic city-states established colonies on the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and the Mediterranean ([[Asia Minor]], Sicily and Southern Italy in [[Magna Graecia]]), and in the 5th century BC their eastward expansions led to retaliation from the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]]. During the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], the Hellenic city-states formed alliances among each other and defeated the Persian Empire at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. Some Greek city-states formed the [[Delian League]] to continue fighting Persia, but Athens' position as leader of this league led Sparta to form the rival [[Peloponnesian League]]. The [[Peloponnesian War]]s ensued, and the Peloponnesian League was victorious. Subsequently, discontent with [[Spartan hegemony]] led to the [[Corinthian War]] and the defeat of Sparta at the [[Battle of Leuctra]].

Hellenic infighting left Greek city states vulnerable, and [[Philip II of Macedon]] united the Greek city states under his control. The son of Philipp II, [[Alexander the Great]], invaded [[Iran|Persia]], Egypt and [[India]], and increased contact with people and cultures in these regions marked the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]].

===The rise of Rome===
{{Main|Ancient Rome|Roman Republic|Roman Empire}}
[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] addresses the [[Roman Senate]] to denounce [[Catiline]]'s conspiracy to overthrow the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], by [[Cesare Maccari]]]]

Much of Greek learning was assimilated by the nascent Roman state as it expanded outward from Italy, taking advantage of its enemies' inability to unite: the only challenge to Roman ascent came from the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]], and its defeats in the three [[Punic Wars]] marked the start of Roman [[hegemony]]. First governed by [[Roman kings|kings]], then as a senatorial republic (the [[Roman Republic]]), Rome finally became an empire at the end of the 1st century BC, under [[Augustus]] and his [[authoritarian]] successors.

The [[Roman Empire]] had its centre in the Mediterranean, controlling all the countries on its shores; the northern border was marked by the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. Under emperor [[Trajan]] (2nd century AD) the empire reached its maximum expansion, controlling approximately {{convert|5900000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land surface, including [[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Dacia (Roman province)|Romania]] and parts of [[Mesopotamia]]. A period of [[Pax Romana|peace]], [[Roman civilization|civilisation]] and an efficient [[centralised government]] in the subject territories ended in the 3rd century, when a [[Crisis of the Third Century|series of civil wars]] undermined Rome's economic and social strength.

In the 4th century, the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] were able to slow down the process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul). Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in 313 with the [[Edict of Milan]], thus setting the stage for the [[Christian Church|Church]] to become the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in about 380.

===Decline of the Roman Empire===
{{Main|Decline of the Roman Empire|Crisis of the Third Century}}

The Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell. [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], surrendered to the Germanic King [[Odoacer]]. The British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] argued in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) that the Romans had become decadent, they had lost civic virtue.

Gibbon said that the adoption of Christianity, meant belief in a better life after death, and therefore made people lazy and indifferent to the present. "From the eighteenth century onward", Glen W. Bowersock has remarked,<ref>Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' '''49'''.8 (May 1996:29<U+2013>43) p. 31.</ref> "we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears." It remains one of the greatest historical questions, and has a tradition rich in scholarly interest.

Some other notable dates are the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the [[Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against [[Alaric I]], the death of [[Stilicho]] in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of [[Justinian I]], the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a "fall", the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures | volume=A: To 1500|author=Hunt, Lynn|coauthors=Thomas R.

===Late Antiquity and Migration Period===
{{Main|Late Antiquity|Migration Period}}
[[File:Invasions of the Roman Empire 1.png|thumb|A simplified map of migrations from the 2nd to the 5th century. See also the [[:File:World 820.png|map of the world in 820 AD]].]]

When Emperor Constantine had reconquered Rome under the banner of the [[Christian cross|cross]] in 312, he soon afterwards issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, declaring the legality of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In addition, Constantine officially shifted the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma- it was later named Constantinople ("City of Constantine").

In 395 [[Theodosius I]], who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire, and from thenceforth, the empire would be split into two halves: the [[Western Roman Empire]] centred in [[Ravenna]], and the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) centred in Constantinople. The Western Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by Germanic tribes (see: [[Migration Period]]), and in 476 finally fell to the [[Heruli]] chieftain [[Odoacer]].

[[File:Europa in 526.png|thumb|left|Map showing Europe in 526 AD with the three dominating powers of the west]]
Roman authority in the Western part of the Empire collapsed and the western provinces soon were to be dominated by three great powers, the [[Franks]] ([[Merovingian dynasty]]) in [[Francia]] 481<U+2013>843 AD (covered much of present France and Germany), the [[Visigothic kingdom]] 418<U+2013>711 AD in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]] 493<U+2013>553 AD in [[Italy]] and parts of [[Balkan]] this kingdom were later replaced by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] 568<U+2013>774 AD.
These new powers of the west were the continuers of the Roman traditions until they evolved into a merge of Roman and Germanic cultures. In Italy [[Theodoric the Great]] began the cultural romanization of the new world he had built, he made [[Ravenna]] a center of Romano-Greek culture of art and his court fostered a flowering of literary and the philosophical in [[Latin]]. In Iberia, [[Chindasuinth|King Chindasuinth]] created the [[Visigothic Code]].
<ref>http://books.google.dk/books?id=2o5V2GWlaFIC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=franks+continuers+of+the+roman+traditions&source=bl&ots=vf8IfSaffp&sig=u8czjiAfERfWudH-t1iGcqR3YsY&hl=da&sa=X&ei=pNS3UJP0Aajk4QTCy4H4CA&ved=0CGQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=franks%20continuers%20of%20the%20roman%20traditions&f=false</ref>

In Western Europe, a political structure was emerging: in the power vacuum left in the wake of Rome's collapse, localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked. [[Tithe]]s were paid to the lord of the land, and the lord owed duties to the regional prince. The tithes were used to pay for the state and wars.

This was the [[feudalism|feudal]] system, in which new princes and kings arose, the greatest of which was the Frank ruler [[Charlemagne]]. In 800, Charlemagne, reinforced by his massive territorial conquests, was crowned Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) by [[Pope Leo III]], effectively solidifying his power in western Europe.

Charlemagne's reign marked the beginning of a new Germanic Roman Empire in the west, the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Outside his borders, new forces were gathering. The [[Kievan Rus']] were marking out their territory, a [[Great Moravia]] was growing, while the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] were securing their borders.

For the duration of the 6th century, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] (see [[Roman<U+2013>Persian Wars]]), followed by the onslaught of the arising Islamic [[Caliphate]] ([[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]). By 650, the provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Palestine and Syria]] were lost to the [[Rashidun army|Muslim forces]], followed by [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy]] in the 7th and 8th centuries (see [[Muslim conquests]]). The Arab invasion from the east was stopped after the intervention of [[Bulgarian Empire]] (see [[Tervel of Bulgaria]]).

[[File:Europe 814.svg|thumb|Map of Europe in 814, as the [[Frankish Empire]] reached its peak, while [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] faced the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic conquest]]]]
The Middle Ages are commonly dated from the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] (or by some scholars, before that) in the 5th century to the beginning of the [[early modern period]] in the 16th century, marked by the rise of [[nation state]]s, the division of Western Christianity in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the rise of [[humanism]] in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web|work=Enyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-58260/history-of-Europe |title=History of Europe:: The Middle Ages |date= |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref>

Many modern European states owe their origins to events unfolding in the Middle Ages; present European political boundaries are, in many regards, the result of the military and dynastic achievements during this tumultuous period.

===Byzantium===
{{Main|Byzantine Empire}}
[[File:Hagia Sophia Southwestern entrance mosaics 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantine I]] and [[Justinian I]] offering their fealty to the Virgin Mary inside the [[Hagia Sophia]]]]

Many consider Emperor [[Constantine I]] (reigned 306<U+2013>337) to be the first "[[Byzantine Emperor]]". It was he who moved the imperial capital in 324 from [[Nicomedia]] to [[Byzantium]], re-founded as Constantinople, or Nova Roma ("[[New Rome]]").<ref>Fletcher, Banister, "Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture", Architectural Press; 20 edition (11 September 1996), ISBN 978-0-7506-2267-7, pp 172</ref> The city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] itself had not served as the capital since the reign of [[Diocletian]]. Some date the beginnings of the Empire to the reign of [[Theodosius I]] (379<U+2013>395) and Christianity's official supplanting of the pagan [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], or following his death in 395, when the empire was split into two parts, with capitals in Rome and Constantinople. Others place it yet later in 476, when [[Romulus Augustulus]], traditionally considered the last western Emperor, was deposed, thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the [[Greek East]]. Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of [[Heraclius]] (c. 620) when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions. In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of hellenization and increasing [[Christianisation]] was already under way. The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453.
The [[Plague of Justinian]] was a [[pandemic]] that afflicted the [[Byzantine Empire]], including its capital [[Constantinople]], in the years 541<U+2013>542. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people across the world.<ref>[http://dpalm.med.uth.tmc.edu/courses/BT2003/BTstudents2003_files%5CPlague2003.htm The History of the Bubonic Plague]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1996/plague.htm |title=Scientists Identify Genes Critical to Transmission of Bubonic Plague |publisher=.niaid.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=31 January 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007012619/http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/1996/plague.htm |archivedate = 7 October 2007}}</ref> It caused [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]] to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ralph R.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Early Middle Ages|Muslim Conquest}}
The Early Middle Ages span roughly five centuries from 500 to 1000.<ref>Events used to mark the period's beginning include the sack of Rome by the [[Goths]] (410), the deposition of the last western [[Roman Emperor]] (476), the [[Battle of Tolbiac]] (496) and the [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>554)|Gothic War]] (535<U+2013>552). Particular events taken to mark its end include the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Otto I the Great]] (962), the [[East<U+2013>West Schism|Great Schism]] (1054) and the [[Norman conquest of England]] (1066).</ref> [[File:Europe around 650.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Europe around 650]]

From the 7th century Byzantine history was greatly affected by the rise of Islam and the [[Caliphates]]. Muslim [[Arabs]] first invaded historically Roman territory under [[Ab<U+016B> Bakr]], first Caliph of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], who entered [[Roman Syria]] and [[Roman Mesopotamia]]. Under [[Umar]], the second Caliph, the Muslims decisively conquered Syria and Mesopotamia, as well as [[Roman Palestine]], [[Roman Egypt]], and parts of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Africa Province|Roman North Africa]]. This trend continued under Umar's successors and under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], which conquered the rest of Mediterranean North Africa and most of the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Iberian Peninsula]]. Over the next centuries Muslim forces were able to take further European territory, including [[Cyprus in the Middle Ages|Cyprus]], Malta, [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]], and [[history of Islam in southern Italy|Sicily and parts of southern Italy]].<ref>Kennedy, Hugh (1995). "The Muslims in Europe". In McKitterick, Rosamund, ''The New Cambridge Medieval History: c.500-c.700'', pp. 249<U+2013>272. Cambridge University Press. 052136292X.</ref>

The Muslim conquest of Hispania began when the [[Moors]] (mostly [[Berber people|Berbers]] with some [[Arab]]s) invaded the Christian [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom of [[Iberian peninsula|Hispania]] in the year 711, under their Berber leader [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]]. They landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his superior, [[Musa ibn Nusair]]. During the eight-year campaign most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was brought under Muslim rule <U+2013> save for small areas in the northwest ([[Asturias]]) and largely [[Basque people|Basque]] regions in the [[Pyrenees]]. In 711 the [[Visigothic]] [[Hispania]], was very weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne, starring two Visigoth suitors. The Muslims took advantage of the crisis that crossed the [[Hispania|Hispano]]-[[Visigothic]] society, to carry out their plan of invasion.  This territory, under the Arab name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad]] empire.

The unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717<U+2013>718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. In 722 [[Don Pelayo]], a [[nobleman]] of Visigothic origin, formed an army of 300 [[Astures|Astur]] soldiers, to confront Munuza's Muslim troops. In the [[battle of Covadonga]], the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire. The Christian victory marked the beginning of the [[Reconquista]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], whose first sovereign was Don Pelayo. The conquerors intended to continue their expansion in Europe and move northeast across the Pyrenees,  but were defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frank]]ish leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the '[[Abb<U+0101>sids]] and most of the Umayyad clan massacred.

A surviving Umayyad prince, [[Abd-ar-rahman I]], escaped to Spain and founded a new Umayyad dynasty in the [[Caliph of Cordoba|Emirate of Cordoba]], (756). Charles Martel's son, [[Pippin the Short]] retook [[Narbonne]], and his grandson Charlemagne established the [[Marca Hispanica]] across the Pyrenees in part of what today is [[Catalonia]], reconquering [[Girona]] in 785 and [[Barcelona]] in 801. The Umayyads in Spain proclaimed themselves caliphs in 929. During this period, most of Europe was [[Christianised]], and the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]" following the fall of Rome took place. The establishment of the [[Frankish Empire]] by the 9th century led to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] on the continent.

The [[Holy Roman Empire]] emerged around 800, as [[Charlemagne]], king of the [[Franks]], was crowned by the pope as emperor. His empire based in modern France, the [[Low Countries]] and Germany expanded into modern Hungary, Italy, [[Bohemia]], Lower Saxony and Spain. He and his father received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted help against the [[Lombards]]. The pope was officially a vassal of the [[Byzantine Empire]], but the Byzantine emperor did (could do) nothing against the Lombards.

To the east, [[Bulgaria]] was established in 681 and became the first [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] country. The powerful [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the Balkans for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe. The Empire created the [[Cyrillic script]] during the 10th century AD, at the [[Preslav Literary School]]. Two states, [[Great Moravia]] and [[Kievan Rus']], emerged among the Slavic peoples respectively in the 9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the [[Viking]]s who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the [[longship]]s. The [[Invasion#Magyar invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] pillaged mainland Europe, the [[Pechenegs]] raided Bulgaria, Rus States and the [[Arab]] states. In the 10th century independent kingdoms were established in Central Europe, for example, Poland and [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Hungarians had stopped their pillaging campaigns; prominent also included [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] in the [[Balkans]].  The subsequent period, ending around 1000, saw the further growth of [[feudalism]], which weakened the Holy Roman Empire.

In the eastern Europe, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in 921, after [[Alm<U+0131><U+015F> I]] converted to Islam under the missionary efforts of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]].<ref>Gerald Mako, "The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199<U+2013>223.</ref>

[[Slavery in early medieval Europe]] had mostly died out in western Europe about the year 1000 AD, replaced by [[serfdom]]. It lingered longer in England and in peripheral areas linked to the Moslem world, where slavery continued to flourish. Church rules suppressed slavery of Christians.  Most historians argue the transition was quite abrupt around 1000, but some see a gradual transition from about 300 to 1000.<ref>Seymour Drescher and Stanley L. Engerman, eds. ''A Historical Guide to World Slavery'' (1998) pp 197-200</ref>

===High Middle Ages===

[[File:Europe map 1092.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Europe in 1092]]
[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|Europe in 1097, as the [[First Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]] commences]]
The slumber of the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] was shaken by renewed crisis in the Church. In 1054, the [[East<U+2013>West Schism]], an insoluble split, occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in [[Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Constantinople]] (nowadays Istanbul).

The High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a [[Medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century.
From about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The [[Viking]]s had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic [[Apostolic Kingdom]] of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]], major barbarian incursions ceased.

In the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the "great clearances", vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the [[Elbe]] river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded [[Crusader states|European colonies]] in the [[Levant]], the majority of the [[Reconquista|Iberian Peninsula was conquered]] from the Muslims, and the [[Normans]] colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.

The High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. the most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of [[Gothic architecture]], which evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]]. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian [[city-state]]s, such as [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]. The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the [[Seljuq Turks|infidels]], who occupied the [[Holy Land]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]] led [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of [[Scholasticism]].

====A divided church====
{{Main|East<U+2013>West Schism|Norman conquest of England}}
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicts the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the events leading to it]]

The Great Schism between the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by [[Pope Leo IX]] asserting authority over three of the seats in the [[Pentarchy]], in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empire's borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion. [[Antioch]] had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed a right and a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the [[filioque]] clause in the [[Nicene Creed]] which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over [[liturgy|liturgical]]. The Schism of Roman Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] followed centuries of estrangement between Latin and Greek worlds.

Further changes were set afoot with a redivision of power in Europe. [[William the Conqueror]], a [[Duke of Normandy]] invaded England in 1066. The Norman Conquest was a pivotal event in [[History of England|English history]] for several reasons.  This linked England more closely with continental Europe through the introduction of a Norman aristocracy, thereby lessening Scandinavian influence. It created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe and engendered a sophisticated governmental system.  Being based on an island, moreover, England was to develop a powerful navy and trade relationships that would come to constitute a vast part of the world including India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many key naval strategic points like [[Bermuda]], [[Suez]], Hong Kong and especially [[Gibraltar]].  These strategic advantages grew and were to prove decisive until after the [[Second World War]].

====Holy wars====

[[File:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|The [[Siege of Antioch]], from a medieval miniature painting, during the [[First Crusade]]]]
After the [[East<U+2013>West Schism]], [[Western Christianity]] was adopted by newly created kingdoms of Central Europe: [[Poland]], Hungary and [[Bohemia]]. The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and Emperor. The geographic reach of the Roman Catholic Church expanded enormously due to conversions of pagan kings (Scandinavia, [[Lithuania]], Poland, Hungary), Christian [[Reconquista]] of [[Al-Andalus]], and [[crusades]]. Most of Europe was Roman Catholic in the 15th century.

Early signs of the rebirth of civilisation in western Europe began to appear in the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the economic and cultural growth of independent [[city-state]]s such as [[Venice#History|Venice]] and [[History of Florence|Florence]]; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation (usually marked by rivalry between the monarchy, the aristocratic feudal lords and the church) actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in their own cultural vernaculars, instead of the traditional [[Latin]]. Notable figures of this movement would include [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Christine de Pizan]] (born Christina da Pizzano), the former writing in Italian, and the latter, although an Italian (Venice), relocated to France, writing in French. (See [[Reconquista]] for the latter two countries.) On the other hand, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.

The 13th and 14th century, when the [[Mongol Empire]] came to power, is often called the ''Age of the Mongols''. Mongol armies expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]]. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |date= |accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref> [[Kipchak-Cuman Confederation]], Hungary, and Poland (which had remained sovereign state). Mongolian records indicate that Batu Khan was planning a complete conquest of the remaining European powers, beginning with a winter attack on Austria, Italy and Germany, when he was recalled to [[Mongolia]] upon the death of Great Khan [[<U+00D6>gedei Khan|<U+00D6>gedei]].

[[File:Pestilence spreading 1347-1351 europe.png|thumb|left|The spread of the "Black Death" from 1347 to 1351 through Europe]]

The Late Middle Ages span the 14th and 15th centuries. Around 1300, centuries of European prosperity and growth came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[Great Famine of 1315<U+2013>1317]] and the [[Black Death]], reduced the population by as much as half according to some estimates. Along with depopulation came social unrest and [[endemic warfare]]. France and England experienced serious peasant risings: the [[Jacquerie]], the [[Peasants' Revolt]], and the [[Hundred Years' War]]. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]. Collectively these events are sometimes called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].<ref>Cantor, p. 480.</ref>

Beginning in the 14th century, the [[Baltic Sea]] became one of the most important [[trade route]]s. The [[Hanseatic League]], an alliance of trading cities, facilitated the absorption of vast areas of Poland, [[Lithuania]] and other [[Baltic states]] into trade with other European countries. This fed the growth of powerful states in this part of Europe including Poland-Lithuania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Muscovy later on. The conventional end of the [[Middle Ages]] is usually associated with the fall of the city [[Constantinople]] and of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The Turks made the city the capital of their [[Ottoman Empire]], which lasted until 1922 and included [[Egypt]], Syria and most of the [[Balkans]]. The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], also sometimes referred to as the Turkish wars, marked an essential part of the history of the continent as a whole.

==Early modern Europe==

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]]]
The Early Modern period spans the centuries between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]],  roughly from 1500 to 1800, or from the discovery of the [[New World]] in 1492 to the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.
The period is characterised by the rise to importance of science and increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], secularised civic politics and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise, beginning in northern Italian republics such as [[Genoa]]. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church.
The period includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[European colonisation of the Americas]] and the [[European witch-hunts]].

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance}}
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] depicts his vision for the perfectly proportioned man]]

Despite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress within the arts and sciences. A renewed interest in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] texts led to what has later been termed the [[Italian Renaissance]].

The Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [[early modern period]]. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and [[middle Europe]] during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual enquiry.

The Italian [[Petrarch]] (Francesco di Petracco), deemed the first full-blooded Humanist, wrote in the 1330s: "I am alive now, yet I would rather have been born in another time." He was enthusiastic about Greek and Roman antiquity.  In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by the feeling that the inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild. [[Matteo Palmieri]] wrote in the 1430s: "Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age." The renaissance was born: a new age where learning was very important.

The Renaissance was inspired by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]].  The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance<U+2014>a rebirth of civilization itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert A. Nisbet|title=History of the Idea of Progress|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QDRWfZ9Ydw0C&pg=PA103|year=1980|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=103}}</ref>

Important political precedents were also set in this period. [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]]'s political writing in ''[[The Prince]]'' influenced later absolutism and real-politik.  Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.

In all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought<U+2014>the immediate past being too "Gothic" in language, thought and sensibility.

During this period, Spain experienced the epoch of greatest splendor cultural of its history. This epoch is known as the [[Golden Age|Spanish Golden age]] and took place between the sixteenth and seventeenth.

===Exploration and trade===
{{Main|Age of Discovery}}
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|[[Cantino planisphere]], 1502, earliest chart showing explorations by [[Vasco da Gama|Gama]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[Pedro <U+00C1>lvares Cabral|Cabral]]]]

Toward the end of the period, an era of discovery began. The growth of the [[Ottoman Empire]], culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, cut off trading possibilities with the east. Western Europe was forced to discover new trading routes, as happened with Columbus's travel to the Americas in 1492, and [[Vasco da Gama]]'s circumnavigation of [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and Africa in 1498.

The numerous wars did not prevent European states from exploring and conquering wide portions of the world, from Africa to Asia and the newly discovered Americas. In the 15th century, Portugal led the way in geographical exploration along the coast of Africa in search for a maritime route to India, followed by Spain near the close of the 15th century; dividing their exploration of world according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] of 1494.<ref>[http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html Translation of the Treaty of Tordesillas] by [[Frances Gardiner Davenport]]</ref> They were the first states to set up colonies in America and [[factory (trading post)|trading posts (factories)]] along the shores of Africa and Asia, establishing the first direct European diplomatic contacts with Southeast Asian states in 1511, China in 1513 and Japan in 1542. In 1552, Russian tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] conquered two major [[Tatar]] khanates, [[Khanate of Kazan]] and the [[Astrakhan Khanate]], and the [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s voyage of 1580 led to the annexation of the Tatar [[Siberian Khanate]] into Russia; the Russians would soon after conquer the rest of [[Siberia]].
Oceanic explorations were soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606<ref>MacKnight, CC (1976). ''The Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers in Northern Australia''. Melbourne University Press.</ref> and New Zealand in 1642.

===Reformation===
{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}
[[File:95Thesen.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Ninety-Five Theses]] of German monk [[Martin Luther]], which criticized the Catholic Church]]
[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|left|thumb|350px|Map of Europe in 1648]]

Spreading through Europe with the development of [[printing press]], knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. The most common dating begins in 1517, when Luther published ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', and concludes in 1648 with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] that ended years of [[European wars of religion|European religious wars]].<ref>Euan Cameron, ''The European Reformation'' (1991)</ref>

During this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the [[Protestant Reformation]]. It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than [[Martin Luther]] began to emerge as well like [[John Calvin]] whose [[Calvinism]] had influence in many countries and King [[Henry VIII of England]] who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the [[Anglican Church]] (contrary to popular belief, this is only half true; his daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] finished the organization of the church). These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralised and powerful.

The Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the [[Counter-Reformation]], which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic Dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the [[Jesuits]], who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of [[St Philip Neri]], who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the Church institutions within their kingdoms.

Unlike many European countries, the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Hungary, were more tolerant. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided between Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.

Another important development in this period was the growth of pan-European sentiments. Em<U+00E9>ric Cruc<U+00E9> (1623) came up with the idea of the [[European Council]], intended to end wars in Europe; attempts to create lasting peace were no success, although all European countries (except the Russian and Ottoman Empires, regarded as foreign) agreed to make peace in 1518 at the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]]. Many wars broke out again in a few years. The Reformation also made European peace impossible for many centuries.

[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Europa regina]], 1570 print by [[Sebastian M<U+00FC>nster]] of [[Basel]]]]

Another development was the idea of 'European superiority'. The ideal of civilisation was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilised; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]] interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. [[Francis Bacon]] and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup> In the 15th century, at the end of the Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the [[New Monarchs]] who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand the Parliament in the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements between territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.

===Mercantilism and colonial expansion===
{{Main|Mercantilism}}
[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|left|Animated map showing the evolution of [[Colonial empire]]s from 1492 to the present]]

The [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] states (Spain and Portugal) were able to dominate [[New World]] (American) colonial activity in the 16th century. The Spanish constituted the first global empire and during the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth century, Spain was the most powerful nation in the world, but was increasingly challenged by [[British colonisation of the Americas|British]], [[French colonisation of the Americas|French]], and the short-lived [[New Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[New Sweden|Swedish]] colonial efforts of the 17th and 18th centuries.  New forms of trade and expanding horizons made new forms of [[Federalism|government]], [[Constitutionalism|law]] and [[Mercantilism|eco]] [[Free market|nomics]] necessary.

Colonial expansion continued in the following centuries (with some setbacks, such as successful wars of independence in the [[American Revolution|British American colonies]] and then later [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico]], [[Argentine War of Independence|Argentina]], [[Brazilian Independence|Brazil]], and [[Latin American wars of independence|others]] amid the European turmoil of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). Spain had control of a large part of North America, all of Central America and a great part of South America, the Caribbean and the [[Philippines]]; Britain took the whole of Australia and New Zealand, most of India, and large parts of Africa and North America; France held parts of Canada and India (nearly all of which was lost to Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|in 1763]]), [[French Indochina|Indochina]], large parts of Africa and Caribbean islands; the Netherlands gained the [[Indies|East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and islands in the Caribbean; Portugal obtained Brazil and several territories in Africa and Asia; and later, powers such as Germany, Belgium, Italy and Russia acquired further colonies.

This expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them. [[Mercantilism|Trade]] flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of the Spain's total budget.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conquest in the Americas|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013228023117|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The European countries fought wars that were largely paid for by the money coming in from the colonies. Nevertheless, the profits of the [[Slave trade#The Americas|slave trade]] and of plantations of the [[West Indies]], then the most profitable of all the British colonies, amounted to less than 5% of the [[British Empire]]'s economy (but was generally more profitable) at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 18th century.

Smith, eds. 1997"/><ref name="Trevor Aston 1965"/> The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the largest state in Europe, temporarily disappeared. In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the Spanish empire, the world's first global empire. In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy (England, Scotland, Ireland, and its North American colonies) rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. The crises spread far beyond Europe<U+2014>for example Ming China, the most populous state in the world, collapsed. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Parker suggests that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially global cooling.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, "Crisis and Catastrophe: The Global Crisis of the Seventeenth Century Reconsidered," ''American Historical Review'' (2008) 113#4 pp. 1053<U+2013>1079.</ref><ref>J.

===Enlightenment===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
[[File:Encyclopedie de D'Alembert et Diderot - Premiere Page - ENC 1-NA5.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Encyclop<U+00E9>die]]'', published in France in 1751, presented a [[Figurative system of human knowledge|taxonomy of human knowledge]] inspired by [[Francis Bacon]]]]

Throughout the early part of this period, capitalism (through [[Mercantilism]]) was replacing [[feudalism]] as the principal form of economic organisation, at least in the western half of Europe. The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a [[Commercial Revolution]]. The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which culminated in the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the [[French Wars of Religion]], which ended in the triumph of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon Dynasty]]. England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] to a moderate [[Anglicanism]]. Much of modern day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is notable in this time for its [[religious tolerance|religious indifference]] and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.<!--this paragraph is still pretty bad-->

The [[Thirty Years' War]] was fought between 1618 and 1648, principally on the territory of today's Germany, and involved most of the major [[power (international)|European powers]]. Beginning as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in [[Bohemia]], it gradually developed into a general war involving much of Europe, for reasons not necessarily related to religion.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9072150/Thirty-Years-War "Thirty Years' War"], ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]''</ref> The major impact of the war, in which [[mercenary]] armies were extensively used, was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and [[Infectious disease#Mortality from infectious diseases|disease]] devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the [[Low Countries]], Bohemia and Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved. Between one-fourth and one-third of the German population perished from direct military causes or from illness and starvation related to the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historymedren.about.com/library/text/bltxtgermany16.htm |title=Germany <U+2013> The Thirty Years' War <U+2013> The Peace of Westphalia |publisher=Historymedren.about.com |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}</ref> The war lasted for thirty years, but the conflicts that triggered it continued unresolved for a much longer time.
[[File:Herman Moll Map of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], Europe's borders were still stable in 1708]]
After the [[Peace of Westphalia]] which ended the war in favour of nations deciding their own religious allegiance, [[Political absolutism|Absolutism]] became the norm of the continent, while parts of Europe experimented with constitutions foreshadowed by the [[English Civil War]] and particularly the [[Glorious Revolution]]. European military conflict did not cease, but had less disruptive effects on the lives of Europeans. In the advanced northwest, [[the Enlightenment]] gave a philosophical underpinning to the new outlook, and the continued spread of literacy, made possible by the [[printing press]], created new secular forces in thought. Again, the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth would be an exception to this rule, with its unique quasi-democratic [[Golden Freedom]]. But in 1648 beginning of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in Ukraine, at this time in the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which continues until 1654, and results is concluded in the city of [[Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi|Pereyaslav]] during the meeting between the [[Cossacks]] of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Zaporozhian Host]] and [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexey I]] of Russia the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]].
[[File:Map of Europe in 1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Map of Europe in [[1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres|1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World]]]]
Europe in 16th and 17th century was an arena of conflict for domination in the continent between Sweden, the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This period saw a gradual decline of these three powers which were eventually replaced by new enlightened absolutist monarchies, Russia, [[Prussia]] and Austria. By the turn of the 19th century they became new powers, having [[Partitions of Poland|divided Poland]] between them, with Sweden and Turkey having experienced substantial territorial losses to Russia and Austria respectively as well as pauperisation. Numerous Polish Jews emigrated to France, Germany and America, founding Jewish communities in places where they had been expelled from during the Middle Ages.

The "[[The long 19th century|long nineteenth century]]", from 1789 to 1914 sees the drastic social, political and economic changes initiated by the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and following the reorganisation of the political map of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the rise of Nationalism, the rise of the [[Russian Empire]] and the peak of the [[British Empire]], paralleled by the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]]. Finally, the rise of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] initiated the course of events that culminated in the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914.

===Industrial Revolution===
{{Main|Industrial Revolution}}
[[File:Dore London.jpg|thumb|London's chimney sky in 1870, by [[Gustave Dor<U+00E9>]]]]
The Industrial Revolution was a period in the late 18th century and early 19th century when major changes in agriculture, manufacturing, and transport affected [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] and cultural conditions in Britain and subsequently spread throughout Europe and North America and eventually the world, a process that continues as industrialisation. In the later part of the 18th century the manual labour based economy of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] began to be replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It started with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Once started it spread. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads and railways. The introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by coal) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity.<ref>Business and Economics.

===Political revolution===
{{Main|American Revolution|French Revolution|Napoleonic Wars}}
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right|The storming of the [[Bastille]] in the French Revolution of 1789]]
French intervention in the [[American Revolutionary War]] had bankrupted the state. After repeated failed attempts at financial reform, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] was persuaded to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], a representative body of the country made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The members of the Estates-General assembled in the [[Palace of Versailles]] in May 1789, but the debate as to which voting system should be used soon became an impasse. Come June, the third estate, joined by members of the other two, declared itself to be a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and swore an [[Tennis Court Oath|oath]] not to dissolve until France had a constitution and created, in July, the [[National Constituent Assembly]]. At the same time the people of Paris revolted, famously storming the [[Bastille]] prison on 14 July 1789.

At the time the assembly wanted to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], and over the following two years passed various laws including the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], and a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|fundamental change]] in the relationship between France and Rome. At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people, but as anti-royalism increased along with threat of foreign invasion, the king, stripped of his power, decided to flee along with his family. He was recognised and brought back to Paris. On 12 January 1793, having been convicted of treason, he was executed.

On 20 September 1792 the [[National Convention]] abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]] the National Convention created the [[Committee of Public Safety]], controlled by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] of the [[Jacobin Club]], to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre the committee initiated the [[Reign of Terror]], during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles, and those convicted by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], often on the flimsiest of evidence. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary [[war in the Vend<U+00E9>e|insurrections]] were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the [[Thermidorian Reaction|coup of 9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.

[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|left|thumb|The [[Battle of Waterloo]], where [[Napoleon]] was defeated by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] in 1815]]
[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was France's most successful general in the Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of Italy and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 he returned from Egypt and on [[18 Brumaire]] (9 November) overthrew the government, replacing it with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], in which he was First Consul. On 2 December 1804, after a failed assassination plot, he crowned himself [[First French Empire|Emperor]]. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria ([[Third Coalition]]), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time failure to lure the superior British fleet away from the [[English Channel]], ending in a decisive French defeat at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October put an end to hopes of an invasion of Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (''see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]'') and dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, a [[Fourth Coalition]] was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]]. The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] divided Europe between France and Russia and created the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].

On 12 June 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|invaded Russia]] with a [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]] of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by [[Cossacks]], and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a [[Sixth Coalition|seven nation army]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the [[Six Days' Campaign]] and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of [[Elba]]. He returned to France on 1 March 1815 (''see [[Hundred Days]]''), raised an army, but was comprehensively defeated by a British and Prussian force at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815.

[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Cheering the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Berlin]]
After the defeat of revolutionary France, the other great powers tried to restore the situation which existed before 1789. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], the major powers of Europe managed to produce a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] among the various European empires. This was known as the [[Metternich]] system. However, their efforts were unable to stop the spread of revolutionary movements: the middle classes had been deeply influenced by the ideals of the French revolution, the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought important economical and social changes, the lower classes started to be influenced by socialist, communist and [[anarchism|anarchistic]] ideas (especially those summarised by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''), and the political ideas of the new capitalists became liberalism. Further instability came from the formation of several nationalist movements (in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, etc.) seeking national unification and/or liberation from foreign rule. As a result, the period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. One of the biggest revolutions was in Greece, which had been under Ottoman rule until the early 19th century. On 25 March 1821 (the day of [[Annunciation]] in the Greek Orthodox Church), the Greeks rebelled and declared their independence, led by Theodore Kolokotronis, but did not win the resulting war until 1829. The major European powers saw the Greek war of independence, with its accounts of Turkish atrocities, in a romantic light. Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon I, returned from exile in the United Kingdom in 1848 to be elected to the French parliament, and then as "Prince President" in a coup d'<U+00E9>tat elected himself Emperor, a move approved later by a large majority of the French electorate. He helped in the unification of Italy by fighting the Austrian Empire and joined the [[Crimean War]] on the side of the United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire against Russia. His empire collapsed after being defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], during which Napoleon III himself was captured. In Versailles, King [[Wilhelm I of Prussia]] was proclaimed [[German Emperor|Emperor of Germany]], and the modern state of Germany was born. Even though most revolutions in this period were defeated, most European states had become [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] (rather than absolute) monarchies by 1871, and Germany and Italy had developed into nation-states. The 19th century also saw the [[British Empire]] emerge as the world's first global power due in a large part to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

===Imperialism===
{{Main|Colonial Empires|History of colonialism|Habsburg Empire|Russian Empire|French colonial empire|British Empire|Dutch Empire|Italian colonial empire|German colonial empire}}
[[File:Afrikakonferenz.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Conference (1884)]] headed by [[Otto von Bismarck]] that regulated European colonization in Africa during the [[New Imperialism]] period]]

[[Colonial empires]] were the product of the European [[Age of Discovery]] from the 15th century. The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the [[Renaissance]]. Both the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.

Subsequent major European colonial empires included the [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|British]] empires. The latter, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved transportation technologies of the time. At its height, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], [[German colonial empire|Germany]], and [[Italian colonial empire |Italy]], pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were comparatively smaller than those mentioned above. By the 1860s, the [[Russian Empire]] became the largest contiguous state in the world, and its later successors (first the Soviet Union, then the Russian Federation) continued to be so ever since. Today, Russia has nine [[time zone]]s, stretching slightly over half the world's longitude.

By the mid-19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had declined enough to become a target for the others (see [[History of the Balkans]]). This instigated the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 and began a tenser period of minor clashes among the globe-spanning empires of Europe that eventually set the stage for the [[First World War]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] carried out a series of wars that resulted in the creation of [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] as nation-states, significantly changing the balance of power in Europe. From 1870, [[Otto von Bismarck]] engineered a German hegemony of Europe that put France in a critical situation. It slowly rebuilt its relationships, seeking alliances with Russia and Britain to control the growing power of Germany. In this way, two opposing sides&mdash;the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] and the [[Triple Entente|Triple Entente of 1907]]&mdash;formed in Europe, improving their military forces and alliances year-by-year.

==World Wars and Cold War==
{{See also|20th century}}
[[File:trencheswwi2.jpg|thumb|Trenches were defences against machine guns and artillery in the [[First World War]]]]
The "[[short twentieth century]]", from 1914 to 1991, included the [[First World War]], the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. The First World War drastically changed the map of Europe, ending four major land empires (the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires) and leading to the creation of nation-states across Central and Eastern Europe. The [[October Revolution]] in Russia and the resulting [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] led to the creation of the Soviet Union and the rise of the international communist movement. Later, the [[Great Depression]] caused fascist dictatorships to take power across central Europe, leading to the Second World War. That war ended with the division of Europe between East and West, and also caused the gradual collapse of several [[colonial empire]]s, with the British and French (and other) empires ending in [[decolonisation]] <U+2013> the independence of new states from 1947 to 1970. The fall of Soviet Communism between 1989 and 1991 left the West as the winner of the [[Cold War]] and enabled the [[reunification of Germany]] and an accelerated process of a [[European integration]] that is continuing today, but with German economic dominance.

===First World War===
{{Main|World War I|Home front during World War I}}

After the relative peace of most of the 19th century, the rivalry between European powers, compounded by a rising nationalism among ethnic groups, exploded in August 1914, when the [[First World War]] started. Over 65 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914<U+2013>1918; 20 million soldiers and civilians died, and 21 million were seriously wounded.<ref>[[Chris Clark (historian)|Christopher Clark]], ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2013) p xxiii</ref>  On one side were Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Bulgaria]] (the [[Central Powers]]/[[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]), while on the other side stood [[Serbia]] and the ''[[Triple Entente]]'' <U+2013> the loose coalition of France, Britain and Russia, which were joined by Italy in 1915, Romania in 1916 and by the United States in 1917. The Western Front involved especially brutal combat without any territorial gains by either side. Single battles like Verdun and the Some killed hundreds of thousands of men while leaving the stalemate unchanged. Heavy artillery and machine guns caused most of the casualties, supplemented by poison gas. Czarist Russia collapsed in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. After eight months of liberal rule, the [[October Revolution]] brought [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Bolsheviks to power, leading to the creation of the Soviet Union in place of the disintegrated Russian Empire. With American entry into the war in 1917 on the Allied side, and the failure of Germany's spring 1918 offensive, Germany had run out of manpower, while an average of 10,000 American troops were arriving in France every day in summer 1918. Germany's allies, [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], surrendered with their empires dissolved. Germany finally surrendered as well on 11 November 1918.<ref>Overviews include David Stevenson,  ''Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy'' (2005) and Ian F. W. Beckett, ''The Great War: 1914<U+2013>1918'' (2nd ed. 2007)</ref><ref>For reference see Martin Gilbert, ''Atlas of World War I'' (1995)  and Spencer Tucker, ed., ''The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia'' (1996)</ref> Historians still debate who was to blame for the war, but the victors forced Germany to admit guilt and pay war reparations.

The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58 billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25 billion. Among the Allies, Britain spent $21 billion and the U.S. $17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.<ref>Gerd Hardach, ''The First World War, 1914-1918'' (1977) p 153, using estimated made by H.

===Paris Peace Conference===
{{main|Paris Peace Conference, 1919}}

The world war was settled by the victors at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.  Two dozen nations sent delegations, and there were many nongovernmental groups, but the defeated powers were not invited.<ref>Margaret Macmillan, [[Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War]] (2002)</ref> 

The "[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]" were President [[Woodrow Wilson]] of the United States, Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] of Great Britain, [[George Clemenceau]] of France, and, of least importance, Italian Prime Minister [[Vittorio Orlando]]. They met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which in turn were ratified by the others.<ref> by Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1958) p 363</ref>

The major decisions were the creation of the [[League of Nations]]; the six peace treaties with defeated enemies, most notable the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as  [[League of Nations mandate|"mandates"]], chiefly to Britain and France; and the drawing of new national boundaries (sometimes with plebiscites) to better reflect the forces of nationalism.<ref>Sally Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918-1933'' (2nd ed. 2003)</ref><ref>Zara Steiner, ''The Lights that Failed: European International History 1919-1933'' (2007)</ref>

===Interwar===

[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|right|Europe in 1919]]
In the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) the winners imposed relatively hard conditions on Germany and recognised the new states (such as [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Finland]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]]) created in central Europe from the defunct German, Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires, based on national (ethnic) self-determination. It was a peaceful era with a few small wars before 1922 such as the [[Polish<U+2013>Soviet War]] (1919<U+2013>1921). Prosperity was widespread, and the major cities sponsored a youth culture called the "[[Roaring Twenties]]" that was often featured in the cinema, which attracted very large audiences.

The Allied victory in the First World War seem to mark the triumph of [[History of Liberalism|liberalism]], not just in the Allied countries themselves, but also in Germany and in the new states of Eastern Europe. Authoritarian militarism as typified by Germany had been defeated and discredited. Historian Martin Blinkhorn argues that the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of "cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the League of Nations."  However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new [[Communist International|communist movement]] taking inspiration from the Russian Revolution. Later, fascism took power in Italy in 1925, and similar authoritarian regimes were established in the 1930s in Germany, Portugal, Austria, Poland, Greece, the Baltic countries and Spain. By 1940, there were only four liberal democracies left on the European continent: France, Finland, Switzerland and Sweden.<ref>Martin Blinkhorn, ''The Fascist Challenge'' in Gordon Martel, ed. ''A Companion to Europe: 1900<U+2013>1945'' (2011) p 313 </ref>

===Great Depression: 1929<U+2013>1939===
{{main|Great Depression}}
After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], nearly the whole world sank into a [[Great Depression]], as prices fell, profits fell, and unemployment soared. The worst hit sectors included heavy industry, export-oriented agriculture, mining and lumbering, and construction. World trade fell by two thirds.<ref>Charles Kindleberger, ''The World in Depression, 1929<U+2013>1939'' (2nd ed. 1986)</ref>

Liberalism and democracy were discredited. In most of Europe, as well as in Japan and most of Latin America, nation after nation turned to dictators and authoritarian regimes. The most momentous change of government came when Hitler and his Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. A major civil war took place in [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]], with the nationalists winning. The League of Nations was helpless as Italy conquered Ethiopia and Japan seized Manchuria in 1931 and took over most of China starting in 1937.<ref>David Clay Large, ''Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s'' (1991)</ref>

The [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936<U+2013>1939) was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the rebels (the Nationalists), led by [[Francisco Franco]], won in 1939. There was military intervention as Italy sent land forces, and Germany sent smaller elite air force and armoured units to the Nationalists.  The Soviet Union sold armaments to the leftist Republicans on the other side, while the Communist parties in numerous countries sent soldiers to the "[[International Brigades]]." The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted the left, the communist movement and many liberals against Catholics, conservatives, and fascists. Britain, France and the US remained neutral and refused to sell military supplies to either side. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.<ref> Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'' (1970) pp 262<U+2013>76</ref>

===World War II===
{{main|World War II|Home front during World War II}}
In the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938, Britain and France adopted a policy of [[appeasement]] as they gave Hitler what he wanted out of Czechoslovakia in the hope that it would bring peace. It did not. In 1939 Germany took over the rest of Czechoslovakia and appeasement policies gave way to hurried rearmament as Hitler next turned his attention to Poland.

[[File:AmericanAndSovietAtElbe.jpg|right|thumb|American and Soviet troops [[Elbe Day|meet in April 1945]], east of the [[Elbe River]].]]
After allying with Japan in the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and then also with Mussolini's Italy in the "[[Pact of Steel]]", and finally signing a [[Molotov<U+2013>Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression treaty]] with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Hitler launched the [[Second World War]] on 1 September 1939 by attacking Poland. To his surprise Britain and France declared war on Germany, but there was little fighting during the "Phoney War" period. War began in earnest in spring 1940 with the successful Blitzkrieg conquests of Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, and France. Britain remained alone but refused to negotiate, and defeated Germany's air attacks in the  [[Battle of Britain]]. Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941. Despite initial successes, the German army was stopped close to Moscow in December 1941.<ref>I. C. B. Dear and M. R. D. Foot, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) covers every country and major campaign.</ref>

Over the next year the tide was turned and the Germans started to suffer a series of defeats, for example in the siege of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]]. Meanwhile, Japan (allied to Germany and Italy since September 1940) attacked Britain and the United States on 7 December 1941; Germany then completed its over-extension by declaring war on the United States. War raged between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] (British Empire, Soviet Union, and the United States). The Allied Forces won in North Africa, invaded Italy in 1943, and recaptured France in 1944. In the spring of 1945 Germany itself was invaded from the east by the Soviet Union and from the west by the other Allies. As the Red Army conquered the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in Berlin, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered in early May.<ref>Norman Davies, ''No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe, 1939<U+2013>1945'' (2008)</ref> World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, causing [[World War II casualties|between 50 and 80 million deaths]], the majority of whom were civilians (approximately 38 to 55 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm |title=Second'&#39;Second Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm'&#39; |publisher=Users.erols.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>

This period was also marked by systematic genocide. In 1942<U+2013>45, separately from the war-related deaths, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] succeeded in killing an additional number of over 11 million civilians, including the [[The Holocaust|majority of the Jews of Europe]] and [[Porajmos|Gypsies]] as well as millions of [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Polish]] and [[Generalplan Ost|Soviet]] Slavs.  Meanwhile in the 1930s the Soviet system of [[Gulag|forced labour]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|expulsions]] and [[Holodomor|allegedly engineered famine]] had a similar death toll.  During and after the war millions of civilians were affected by forced population transfers.<ref>Dinah Shelton, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity'' (3 vol. 2004)</ref>

===Cold War===
{{Main|Cold War|NATO|Marshall Plan|European Economic Community}}
[[File:Berlin Wall 1961-11-20.jpg|thumb|East German construction workers building the Berlin Wall, 20 November 1961]]
The world wars ended the pre-eminent position of the old European powers in the world. At the [[Yalta Conference]], Europe was divided into spheres of influence between the victors of World War II, and soon became the principal zone of contention in the [[Cold War]] between the two power blocs, the [[Western countries]] and the [[Communist bloc]]. The United States and the majority of European liberal democracies at the time (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, West Germany etc.) established the [[NATO]] military alliance. Later, the Soviet Union and its satellites in Europe ([[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Romania]]) established the [[Warsaw Pact]] as a counterpoint to NATO. Each alliance was intended to defend against a potential invasion by the other.

[[Communist state]]s were established in the East, while parliamentary democracy became the dominant form of government in the West, and proved highly popular there until the turmoil of the late 1960s. Most historians point to its success as the product of exhaustion, economic prosperity, or the constraints imposed by the Cold War. Martin Conway also adds that an important impetus came from the anti-Nazi wartime political coalitions.<ref>Martin Conway, "The Rise and Fall of Western Europe's Democratic Age, 1945<U+0096><U+2013>1973," ''Contemporary European History'' (2004) 13#1 pp 67<U+2013>88.</ref>

Western Europe launched a process of political and economic integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which grew and evolved into the [[European Union]], and the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107>]] movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, ending the USSR, which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The most violent dissolution happened in [[Yugoslavia]], in the Balkans. Four ([[Slovenia]], Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995. In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. In the post<U+2013>Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact.

Looking at the half century after the war historian [[Walter Laqueur|Walter Lacquer]] concluded:
:"The postwar generations of European elites aimed to create more democratic societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services in a way that prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had every reason to be proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized.  Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values<U+2014>or so it appeared at the time."<ref>Walter Laqueur, "The Slow Death of Europe", ''The National Interest'' [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-the-euro-the-least-europes-worries-5767 16 August 2011 online]</ref>

The post-war period also witnessed a significant rise in the standard of living of the Western European working class. As noted by one historical text, "within a single generation, the working classes of Western Europe came to enjoy the multiple pleasures of the consumer society."<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VwDQ3jAGMX0C&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=John+Maynard+keynes+working+class&source=bl&ots=R0We3ZQt1j&sig=gxEPBC_eEsEG2aBk5TVtS2y_vag&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YaYuUNjFIOHN0QXD6IHgDA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=John%20Maynard%20keynes%20working%20class&f=false</ref>

Western Europe's industrial nations in the 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain under the leadership of prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations at the time of her death in 2013.<ref> David Priestland, <U+201C>Margaret Thatcher?<U+201D> <U+2018><U+2019>BBC History Magazine<U+2019><U+2019> 1 May 2013</ref>

==Recent history==
{{Further|History of the European Union}}

[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Germans standing on top of the [[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], November 1989; it would begin to be torn apart in the following days.]]
Following the end of the Cold War, the [[European Economic Community]] pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries. In 1993, the [[Maastricht Treaty]] established the [[European Union]], succeeding the EEC and furthering political co-operation. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic market via the [[European Economic Area]]. These countries also entered the [[Schengen Agreement]] which lifted border controls between member states.<ref name="Europa History 90-99">{{cite web |title=A Europe without frontiers |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 June 2007}}</ref>

Another major innovation in the Maastricht Treaty was the creation of a single currency for most EU members. The euro was created in 1999 and replaced all previous currencies in 2002. The most notable exception to the currency union was the United Kingdom, which also did not participate in the Schengen Agreement.

However, the EU's desire to work on foreign policy was undermined due to its failure to act during the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] wars, and its division over whether to support the United States lead [[Iraq War]]. European NATO countries were frequently criticized by the United States for insufficient military expenditure, and for not sending enough troops to support NATO's [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|war in Afghanistan]]. Europe meanwhile decided to reap the benefits of its post<U+2013>Cold War [[peace dividend]] and instead supported the development of international law, for example [[European Union and the International Criminal Court|through the International Criminal Court]].

In 2004, the EU [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|enlarged to include 10 new countries]], eight developing former-communist countries (including three which were part of the Soviet Union itself) along with [[Malta]] and the divided island of [[Cyprus]]. These were followed by [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|another two former-communist countries in 2007]]. NATO likewise expanded to include these countries, despite protestations from Russia which was growing more assertive. Russia engaged in a number of bilateral disputes about gas supplies with [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] which endangered gas supplies to Europe. Russia also engaged in [[2008 South Ossetia war|a minor war with Georgia]] in 2008.

However, with the influx of new members in 2004, together with awarding Turkey candidate status, public opinion in the EU turned against enlargement. This was reflected in part by the rejection of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in [[Referendums related to the European Union|referendums]] in France and the Netherlands. The constitution's replacement, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], was also voted down by the Irish before they reversed their decision in 2009. This caused the period up to 2009 to be dominated by "institutional navel gazing" by the EU and a rise in [[euroskepticism]] in some states. The Lisbon Treaty did however enhance the EU's capacity for foreign policy action.

Opposition to Turkish membership of the EU developed in parallel to an increasing unease as to how Europe deals with Islam. [[Al Qaeda]] inspired attacks in [[London bombings of 7 July 2005|London]] and [[Madrid train bombings|Madrid]], together with a perception that Europe's large Muslim minority was not integrating, contributed to a change in public opinion in some countries. Belgium enacted a ban on the [[Burqa]], also pursed by France, while Switzerland [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland|banned minarets]]. The Danish publication of [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoons portraying prophet Muhammad]] further damaged relations with Europe's Muslim population, and the Islamic world at-large.

In 2008, the EU's [[eurozone]] entered its first recession, sparking a debate about its future. Due to the limited [[National accounts|ability]] of the smaller EU nations (most notably [[Economy of Greece#2010<U+2013>present government debt crisis|Greece]]) handling their debts in the recessionary climate, member nations agreed to set up a [[bail out]] mechanism and study proposals for more [[fiscal integration]]. Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Great Britain, Spain (the so-called [[PIGS (economics)|PIGS nations]]) have large debts. In May 2010, the German parliament agreed to loan 22.4 billion euros to Greece over three years, with the stipulation that Greece follow strict austerity measures.
