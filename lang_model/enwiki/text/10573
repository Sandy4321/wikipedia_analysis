A '''playing card''' is a piece of specially prepared heavy [[paper]], thin cardboard, or thin plastic, figured with distinguishing motifs and used as one of a set for playing [[card game]]s. Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling.

A complete set of cards is called a '''pack''' or '''deck''', and the subset of cards held at one time by a player during a game is commonly called a '''hand'''. A deck of cards may be used for playing a great variety of [[card game]]s, some of which may also incorporate [[gambling]]. Because playing cards are both standardized and commonly available, they are often adapted for other uses, such as [[magic (illusion)|magic tricks]], [[cartomancy]], or building a [[house of cards]].

The front (or "face") of each card carries markings that distinguish it from the other cards in the deck and determine its use under the rules of the game being played. The back of each card is identical for all cards in any particular deck, and usually of a single color or formalized design. Usually every card will be smooth however some '''decks''' have [[braille]] to allow blind people to read the card number and suit. The back of playing cards is sometimes used for advertising.<ref>[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/display?irn=78990 National Museum of Australia: Playing cards featuring logo of the FJ Holden]</ref> For most games, the cards are assembled into a deck, and their order is [[randomization|randomized]] by [[Shuffle|shuffling]].

Ancient Chinese "money cards" have four "suits": coins (or cash), strings of coins (which may have been misinterpreted as sticks from crude drawings), myriads (of coins or of strings), and tens of myriads (where a myriad is 10000). These were represented by [[ideogram]]s, with numerals of 2<U+2013>9 in the first three suits and numerals 1<U+2013>9 in the "tens of myriads". Wilkinson suggests that the first cards may have been actual paper currency which were both the tools of gaming and the stakes being played for,<ref name="wilkinson">{{Harvnb|Wilkinson|1895}}</ref> as in [[trading card]] games. The designs on modern [[Mahjong tiles]] likely evolved from those earliest playing cards. However, it may be that the first deck of cards ever printed was a Chinese [[domino]] deck, in whose cards we can see all the 21 combinations of a pair of dice. In [[Kuei-t'ien-lu]], a Chinese text [[redaction|redacted]] in the 11th century, we find that dominoes cards were printed during the Tang Dynasty, contemporary to the [[History of typography in East Asia|first printed books]]. The Chinese word ''p<U+00E1>i'' (<U+724C>) is used to describe both paper cards and gaming tiles.

===Introduction into Europe===
{{See|Tarot}}
Playing cards first entered [[Europe]] in the late 14th century, probably from [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]], with suits very similar to the tarot suits of Swords, Staves, Cups and Coins (also known as disks, and [[pentacle]]s) and those still used in traditional [[Italy|Italian]], [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] decks.<ref>[[Donald Laycock]] in ''Skeptical<U+2014>a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, ISBN 0731657942, p. 67</ref> The first documentary evidence is a ban on their use in 1367, [[Bern|Bern, Switzerland]]. Wide use of playing cards in Europe can, with some certainty, be traced from 1377 onwards.<ref name=Banzhaf>{{Citation |last1=Banzhaf |first1=Hajo |title=Il Grande Libro dei Tarocchi |year=1994 |publisher=Hermes Edizioni |location=Roma |language=Italian |isbn=8-8793-8047-8 |page=16 |DUPLICATE DATA: page=192 }}</ref>

The [[Mamluk|Mameluke]] deck contained 52 cards comprising four "suits": polo sticks, coins, swords, and cups. Each suit contained ten "spot" cards (cards identified by the number of suit symbols or "pips" they show) and three "court" cards named ''malik'' (King), ''n<U+0101>'ib malik'' (Viceroy or Deputy King), and ''th<U+0101>n<U+012B> n<U+0101>'ib'' (Second or Under-Deputy). The Mameluke court cards showed abstract designs not depicting persons (at least not in any surviving specimens) though they did bear the names of military officers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

A complete pack of Mameluke playing cards was discovered by Leo Mayer in the [[Topkap<U+0131> Palace]], [[Istanbul]], in 1939;<ref name="bifao38">{{Citation|title=Le Bulletin de l<U+2019>Institut fran<U+00E7>ais d<U+2019>arch<U+00E9>ologie orientale|last=Mayer|first=Leo Ary|url=http://www.ifao.egnet.net/bifao/38/|year=1939|volume=38|pages=113<U+2013>118|accessdate=2008-09-08|postscript=.}}</ref> this particular complete pack was not made before 1400, but the complete deck allowed matching to a private fragment dated to the 12th or 13th century. In effect it is not a complete deck, but there are cards of three packs of the same style.<ref>International Playing Cards Society Journal, 30-3, page 139</ref>

[[File:Ganjifa1.jpg|thumb|250px|Various [[Ganjifa]] cards from [[Dashavatara]] set, with ten suits depicting the ten [[Avatar]]s of the god [[Vishnu]]]]
It is not known whether these cards influenced the design of the Indian cards used for the game of [[Ganjifa]], or whether the Indian cards may have influenced these. Regardless, the Indian cards have many distinctive features: they are round, generally hand painted with intricate designs, and comprise more than four suits (often as many as thirty two, like a deck in the [[Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum]], painted in the [[Mewar]], a city in [[Rajasthan]], between the 18th and 19th century. Decks used to play have from eight up to twenty suits).

===Spread across Europe and early design changes===
[[Image:ItalianSancaiBowlMid15thCentury.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Italians playing cards, [[Sancai]]-type bowl, Northern Italy, mid-15th century.]]
In the late 14th century, the use of playing cards spread rapidly throughout Europe. Documents mentioning cards date from 1371 in Spain, 1377 in [[Switzerland]], and 1380 in many locations including [[Florence]] and [[Paris]].<ref>[http://trionfi.com/0/p/01/]</ref><ref>[http://trionfi.com/0/p/02/]</ref> A 1369 Paris ordinance [on gaming?] does not mention cards, but its 1377 update does. In the account books of [[Joanna, Duchess of Brabant|Johanna, duchess of Brabant]] and [[Wenceslaus I of Luxemburg|Wenceslaus I, duke of Luxemburg]], an entry dated May 14, 1379, reads: "Given to Monsieur and Madame four peters, two forms, value eight and a half moutons, wherewith to buy a pack of cards". In his book of accounts for 1392 or 1393, Charles or Charbot Poupart, treasurer of the household of [[Charles VI of France]], records payment for the painting of three sets of cards.<ref>Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser & Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.135. Simon & Schuster, New York. ISBN 0684801647.</ref>

The earliest cards were made by hand, like those designed for Charles VI; this was expensive. Printed woodcut decks appeared in the 15th century. The technique of printing [[woodcut]]s to decorate fabric was transferred to printing on [[paper]] around 1400 in Christian Europe, very shortly after the first recorded manufacture of paper there, while in [[Islamic Spain]] it was much [[Old master print|older]]. The earliest dated European woodcut is 1418. No examples of printed cards from before 1423 survive. But from about 1418 to 1450<ref name="trionfi20">[http://trionfi.com/0/p/20/ Early Card painters and Printers in Germany, Austria and Flandern (14th and 15th century)]</ref> professional card makers in [[Ulm]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Augsburg]] created printed decks. Playing cards even competed with devotional images as the most common uses for [[woodcut]] in this period.

Most early woodcuts of all types were coloured after printing, either by hand or, from about 1450 onwards, stencils. These 15th century playing cards were probably painted.

The [[Master of the Playing Cards]] worked in Germany from the 1430s with the newly invented [[printmaking]] technique of [[engraving]]. Several other important [[engraver]]s also made cards, including [[Master ES]] and [[Martin Schongauer]]. Engraving was much more expensive than woodcut, and engraved cards must have been relatively unusual.

[[File:Georges de La Tour 029.jpg|thumb|250px|The Cheat with the Ace of Clubs, [[Georges de La Tour]] (1593<U+2013>1652).]]
In the 15th century in Europe, the [[suit (cards)|suits]] of playing cards varied; typically a deck had four suits, although five suits were common and other structures are also known. In Germany, hearts (Herz/Rot), bells (Schellen), leaves (Gr<U+00FC>n), and acorns (Eichel) became the standard suits and are still used in Eastern and Southeastern German decks today for [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Schafkopf]], [[Doppelkopf]], and other games. [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] cards of the 15th century used swords, batons (or wands), cups, and coins (or rings). The [[Tarot deck|Tarot]], which included extra trump cards, was invented in Italy in the 15th century.

The four [[suit (cards)|suits]] now used in most of the world&nbsp;<U+2014> [[spades (suit)|spades]], [[hearts (suit)|hearts]], [[diamonds (suit)|diamonds]], and [[clubs (suit)|clubs]]&nbsp;<U+2014> originated in France in approximately 1480. The ''tr<U+00E8>fle'' (club) was probably copied from the acorn and the ''pique'' (spade) from the leaf of the German suits. The names "pique" and "spade", however, may have derived from the sword of the Italian suits.<ref>[http://trionfi.com/0/p/16/]</ref> In England, the French suits were eventually used, although the earliest decks had the Italian suits [Chatto, link not provided].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Also in the 15th century, Europeans changed the court cards to represent European royalty and attendants, originally "king", "chevalier" (knight), and "knave". The original meaning of ''knave'' was ''male child'', so in this context the character could represent the "prince", son to the King and Queen; the meaning ''servant'' developed later.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barrington|first=Daines|authorlink=Daines Barrington|title=Archaeologia, or, Miscellaneous tracts relating to antiquity|volume=8|year=1787|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]]|location=|page=141}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|edition=2|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=knave, n, 2}}</ref> In a German pack from the 1440s, Queens replace Kings in two of the suits as the highest card. Fifty-six-card decks containing a King, Queen, Knight, and Valet (from the French tarot court) were common.

Court cards designed in the 16th century in the manufacturing centre of [[Rouen]] became the standard design in England, while a Parisian design became standard in France. Both the Parisian and Rouennais court cards were named after historical and mythological heroes and heroines. The Parisian names have become more common in modern use, even with cards of Rouennais design.

===Later design changes===
[[Image:5 of Hearts - Vanity Fair.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[transformation playing card]] from the 1895 ''Vanity Fair'' deck.]]
[[Image:Musee-historique-lausanne-img 0126.jpg|thumb|250px|Playing cards have been used as vehicles for political statements. Here, a playing card of the [[French Revolution]] symbolising freedom of religion and brotherhood.]]
In early games the kings were ''always'' the highest card in their suit. However, as early as the late 14th century special significance began to be placed on the nominally lowest card, now called the [[Ace]], so that it sometimes became the highest card and the Two, or Deuce, the lowest. This concept may have been hastened in the late 18th century by the [[French Revolution]], where games began being played "ace high" as a symbol of lower classes rising in power above the royalty.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The term "Ace" itself comes from a dicing term in [[Anglo-Norman language]], which is itself derived from the Latin ''as'' (the smallest unit of coinage). Another dicing term, ''trey'' (3), sometimes shows up in playing card games.

Corner and edge indices enabled people to hold their cards close together in a fan with one hand (instead of the two hands previously used). For cards with Latin suits the first pack known is a deck printed by Infirerra and dated 1693 (International Playing Cards Society Journal 30-1 page 34), but were commonly used only at the end of 18th century. Indices in the Anglo-American deck were used from 1875, when the New York Consolidated Card Company patented the Squeezers, the first cards with indices that had a large diffusion. However, the first deck with this innovation was the Saladee's Patent, printed by Samuel Hart in 1864.

Before this time, the lowest court card in an English deck was officially termed the ''Knave'', but its abbreviation ("Kn") was too similar to the King ("K") and thus this term did not translate well to indices. However, from the 17th century on the Knave had often been termed the ''Jack'', a term borrowed from the [[English Renaissance]] card game [[All Fours]] where the Knave of trumps has this name. All Fours was considered a game of the lower classes, so the use of the term Jack at one time was considered vulgar. The use of indices, however, encouraged a formal change from Knave to [[Jack (playing card)|Jack]] in English decks. In decks for non-English languages, this conflict does not exist; the [[French tarot]] deck for instance labels its lowest court card the "Valet", which is the "squire" to the Knight card (not seen in 52-card decks) as the Queen is paired with the King.

This was followed by the innovation of reversible court cards. This invention is attributed to a French card maker of [[Agen]] in 1745. But the French government, which controlled the design of playing cards, prohibited the printing of cards with this innovation. In central Europe (trappola cards), Italy (tarocchino bolognese) and in Spain the innovation was adopted during the second half of 18th century. In Great Britain the deck with reversible court cards was patented in 1799 by Edmund Ludlow and Ann Wilcox. The Anglo-American pack with this design was printed around 1802 by Thomas Wheeler.<ref>International Playing Cards Society Journal XXVII-5 p. 186 and International Playing Cards Society Journal 31-1 p. 22</ref> Reversible court cards meant that players would not be tempted to turn upside-down court cards right side up. Before this, other players could often get a hint of what other players' hands contained by watching them reverse their cards. This innovation required abandoning some of the design elements of the earlier full-length courts.

During the French Revolution, the traditional design of Kings, Queens, and Jacks became Liberties, Equalities, and Fraternities. The radical French government of 1793 and 1794 saw themselves as toppling the old regime and a good revolutionary would not play with Kings or Queens, but with the ideals of the revolution at hand. This would ultimately be reversed in 1805 with the rise of Napoleon.

The United States introduced the [[joker (playing card)|joker]] into the deck. The stylings of the joker and its function are almost identical to [[The Fool (tarot card)|the Fool]] from the original French Tarot deck, which had been removed in the transformation to the standard 52-card French deck. It was devised for the game of [[Euchre]], which spread from Europe to America beginning shortly after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was very popular by the mid-19th century. In Euchre, the highest trump card is the Jack of the trump suit, called the ''right bower'' (or bauer); the second-highest trump, the ''left bower'', is the Jack of the suit of the same color as trumps. The joker was invented c. 1870 as a third trump, the ''best bower'', which ranked higher than the other two ''bowers''. The name of the card is believed to derive from ''juker'', a variant name for Euchre.<ref name="uspchist">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070826144858/http://www.usplayingcard.com/gamerules/briefhistory.html US Playing Card Co. - A Brief History of Playing Cards] (archive.org mirror)</ref><ref name=beal_joker>Beal, George. ''Playing cards and their story.'' 1975. New York: Arco Publishing Comoany Inc. p. 58</ref>

In the 19th century, a type of card known as a [[transformation playing card]] became popular in Europe and America. In these cards, an artist incorporated the pips of the non-face cards into an artistic design.

===Symbolism===
Popular legend holds that the composition of a deck of cards has religious, mystical, or astrological significance.

Thus each suit of 13 cards represents the 13 months of the lunar year. Since the [[Sidereal]] [[lunar month]] may be approximated to 28 days, each suit is equal to 364 days of the year.

Similarly the whole deck of the 52 cards represents the 52 weeks of the year. Therefore the whole deck is also equal to 364 days of the year. For reference see the "[[positivist calendar]]".

The Ace is symbolically <U+201C>[[Alpha and Omega]]<U+201D> or <U+201C>the Beginning and End<U+201D>.

==Current==
{{See also|Suit (cards)}}
===French===<!-- Some card game infoboxes may have different names to this-->
The primary deck of 52 playing cards in use today includes 13 ranks of each of the four French [[suit (cards)|suits]], clubs ({{Clubs}}), diamonds ({{Diams}}), hearts ({{Hearts}}) and spades ({{Spades}}), with reversible Rouennais "court" or [[face cards]]. Each suit includes an [[ace]], depicting a single symbol of its suit; a king, queen, and jack, each depicted with a symbol of their suit; and ranks two through ten, with each card depicting that number of symbols (''pips'') of its suit. As well as these 52 cards, commercial decks often include two [[Joker (playing card)|jokers]] which are removed in preparation for most popular games. The jokers are usually distinguishable by colour.

====Sizes====
The most common sizes for playing cards are poker size (2<U+00BD>in <U+00D7> 3<U+00BD>in; 63&nbsp;mm <U+00D7> 88&nbsp;mm, or B8 size according to [[ISO 216]]) and bridge size (2<U+00BC>in <U+00D7> 3<U+00BD>in, approx. 56&nbsp;mm <U+00D7> 88&nbsp;mm), the latter being narrower, and thus more suitable for games such as [[bridge (game)|bridge]] in which a large number of cards must be held concealed in a player's hand. Other sizes are also available, such as a smaller size (usually 1<U+00BE>in <U+00D7> 2<U+215D>in, approx. 44&nbsp;mm <U+00D7> 66&nbsp;mm) for [[solitaire]], tall narrow designs for travel and larger ones for card tricks. <!-- Text added by [[Pandamonia]], formerly [[Halfakers]] No citation needed. -->The weight of an average B8-sized playing card is 0.063 oz (1.8g), a deck 3.3 oz (94g).<!-- End added text -->

====Styling====
Modern playing cards carry index labels on opposite corners to facilitate identification of the cards when they overlap and so that they appear identical for players on opposite sides. These stylings, together with the popular imagery on the court cards are labelled as "English" or "Anglo-American" and are the most popular forms of the French deck, especially in countries that speak English. Various alternative stylings include indices at all four corners, court indices in different languages, different court imagery or perhaps novelty stylings, but it should be noted that in all these cases, they are still indeed French decks.

[[Image:Playing Cards.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Typical Anglo-American playing cards.]]

The embellished design and manufacturer's logo commonly displayed on the [[Ace of Spades]] began under the reign of [[James I of England]], who passed a law requiring an insignia on that card as proof of payment of a [[tax]] on local manufacture of cards. Until August 4, 1960, decks of playing cards printed and sold in the [[United Kingdom]] were liable for taxable duty and the Ace of Spades carried an indication of the name of the printer and the fact that taxation had been paid on the cards due to [[Stamp Act 1765]]. The packs were also sealed with a government [[duty]] wrapper.

Though specific design elements of the court cards are rarely used in game play and many differ between designs, a few are notable. The Jack of Spades, Jack of Hearts, and King of Diamonds are drawn in profile, while the rest of the court are shown in full face; these cards are commonly called "one-eyed". When deciding which cards are to be made wild in some games, the phrase "acey, deucey, [[one-eyed jack]]" (or "deuces, aces, one-eyed faces") is sometimes used, which means that [[ace]]s, twos, and the one-eyed jacks are all wild. The King of Hearts is the only King with no mustache, and is also typically shown with a [[sword]] behind his head, making him appear to be stabbing himself. This leads to the nickname "suicide king".<ref>[http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~daf/i-p-c-s.org/faq/suicide.php The "Suicide King"], at "Playing-cards Frequently Asked Questions", International Playing-Card Society, 2007.</ref> The axe held by the King of Diamonds is behind his head with the blade facing toward him.  He is traditionally armed with an axe while the other three kings are armed with swords, and thus the King of Diamonds is sometimes referred to as "the man with the axe" because of this. This is the basis of the trump "[[one-eyed jack]]s and the man with the axe".  The Jack of Diamonds is sometimes known as "laughing boy".<ref>[http://monkeyofmars.wordpress.com/category/games/ Games <U+00AB> A cache of random trivia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The [[Ace of Spades]], unique in its large, ornate spade, is sometimes said to be the death card, and in some games is used as a trump card. The [[Queen (playing card)|Queen of Spades]] usually holds a [[scepter]] and is sometimes known as "the bedpost queen", though more often she is called "Black Lady". In many decks, the Queen of Clubs holds a flower. She is thus known as the "flower Queen", (though in many playing cards from Germany and Sweden she is depicted with a fan) though this design element is among the most variable; the standard Bicycle Poker deck depicts all Queens with a flower styled according to their suit.

[[Image:GNOME Aisleriot Solitaire.png|thumb|250px|Solitaire card games are available on many [[operating systems]].]]

There are theories about whom the court cards represent. For example, the Queen of Hearts is believed by some to be a representation of [[Elizabeth of York]]<U+2014>the [[Queen consort]] of [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII of England]], or it is sometimes believed to be a representation of [[Anne Boleyn]], the second wife of Henry VIII. The United States Playing Card Company suggests that, in the past, the King of Hearts was [[Charlemagne]], the King of Diamonds was [[Julius Caesar]], the King of Clubs was [[Alexander the Great]], and the King of Spades was the Biblical [[King David]] (see [[King (playing card)]]). However, the Kings, Queens, and Jacks of standard Anglo-American cards today do not represent anyone in particular. They stem from designs produced in [[Rouen]] before 1516, and, by 1540<U+2013>67, these Rouen designs show well executed pictures in the court cards with the typical court costumes of the time. In these early cards, the Jack of Spades, Jack of Hearts, and King of Diamonds are shown from the rear, with their heads turned back over the shoulder so that they are seen in profile; however, the Rouen cards were so badly copied in England that the current designs are gross distortions of the originals.

Other oddities such as the lack of a moustache on the King of Hearts also have little significance. The King of Hearts did originally have a moustache, but it was lost by poor copying of the original design.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Similarly, the objects carried by the court cards have no significance. They merely differentiate one court card from another and have also become distorted over time.

Some decks include additional design elements; [[casino]] [[blackjack]] decks may include markings intended for a machine to check the ranks of cards. Many casino decks and solitaire decks have four indices instead of the usual two<!--four indices uncommon in continental Europe-->. Some decks have larger indices, often for use in [[stud poker]] games, where being able to read cards from a distance is a benefit and hand sizes are small.
Some decks use [[four-color deck|four colors]] for the suits in order to make it easier to tell them apart: The most common set of colors for poker is black spades, red hearts, blue diamonds and green clubs (<span style="color:black">{{Unicode|<U+2660>}}</span><span style="color:red">{{Unicode|<U+2665>}}</span><span style="color:blue">{{Unicode|<U+2666>}}</span><span style="color:green">{{Unicode|<U+2663>}}</span>). Another common color set is borrowed from the German suits and uses green spades (leaves) and yellow diamonds (bells) with red hearts and black clubs (<span  style="color:black">{{Unicode|<U+2663>}}</span><span style="color:green">{{Unicode|<U+2660>}}</span><span style="color:red">{{Unicode|<U+2665>}}</span><span style="color:yellow">{{Unicode|<U+2666>}}</span>).

When giving the full written name of a specific card, the rank is given first followed by the suit, e.g., "Ace of Spades". Shorthand notation may list the rank first "A<U+2660>" (as is typical when discussing [[poker]]) or list the suit first (as is typical in listing several cards in bridge) "<U+2660>AKQ".

Tens may be either abbreviated to T or written as 10.

====Piquet====
The [[piquet deck]] is a subset of the French-suited 52-card deck, with all values from 2 through 6 in each suit removed. The resulting 32-card deck is notable for its use in a variety of games; a trick-taking game from the 14th century, [[Piquet]], gave the deck its most common name, and the game of [[Belote]], currently the most popular card game in France, also uses this deck. West German players adopted the deck for the game of [[Skat (card game)|Skat]] (the traditional Skat deck uses German suits; see below). Two of these decks are used in the game of [[Bezique]].

====Pinochle/Doppelkopf====
The game of [[Pinochle]], which evolved from the French game [[Bezique]], uses a deck composed of two copies of each Anglo-American card with values from 9 through King and Ace. A deck with the same composition, but different card art, is available in Europe for the very popular German game of [[Doppelkopf]], which derived from the game [[Sheepshead]] and is related to [[Skat (card game)|Skat]].

===Tarot===
{{Main|Tarot}}
[[Image:Tarots cards deal.jpg|thumb|250px|Some modern French-style 78-card [[Tarot Nouveau|Tarot]] cards.]]
[[Image:Tarockkarten in der Hand eines Spielers.jpg|thumb|250px|Some modern Austrian-style 40-card or 54-card [[Tarock]] cards.]]
The 78-card [[Tarot]] deck, and subsets of it, are used for a variety of European trick-taking games. The Tarot is distinguished from most other decks by the use of a separate trump suit of 21 cards, and one Fool, whose role varies according to the specific game. Additionally, it differs from the 52-card deck in the use of one additional court card in each suit, the Cavalier or Knight. In Europe, the deck is known primarily as a playing card deck; in the Americas, the deck is primarily known for its use in [[cartomancy]]; the trumps and fool comprising the [[Major Arcana]] while the 56 suited cards make up the [[Minor Arcana]].

The origins of the tarot deck are thought to be [[Italy|Italian]], with the oldest surviving examples dating from the mid 15th century in Milan, and using the traditional Latin [[suit (cards)|suits]] of Swords, Cups, Coins and Staves (representing the four main classes of feudal society; military, clergy, mercantile trade, and agriculture). It is generally thought that the tarot was invented between 1411 and 1425 by adding trump cards to a deck format that was already popular in Italy as of this period, having been introduced from North Africa in the mid 14th century. The deck spread from Italy to Germanic countries, where the Latin suits evolved into the suits of Leaves (or Shields), Hearts (or Roses), Bells, and Acorns, and a combination of Latin and Germanic suit pictures and names resulted in the internationally recognized French suits of Spades, Hearts, Diamonds and Clubs. It was a simplification of this French-suited tarot deck by removing the trumps that resulted in the English deck, popularized by British colonization and the gentleman's game Brag. The English deck would eventually become the internationally recognized 52-card deck.

The trumps originally represented characters and ideals of increasing power, from the Magician and High Priestess of the 1 and 2 of trumps to the Sun, Judgement and the World at the high end. Allegorical meanings for each card existed as of the earliest days of the deck, but it wasn't until the late 18th century that the works of [[Antoine Court de Gebelin]] made decks based on the [[Tarot de Marseille]] popular for [[divination|divinatory]] purposes.

From this point, the evolution of decks for cartomancy and for gaming diverged; the "reading tarots" based on the symbolic designs of the [[Tarot de Marseille]] (which were modified slightly to produce the widely known [[Rider-Waite]] deck) kept the older style of full-length character art, specific character meanings for the 21 trumps, and the use of the Latin suits (although most of the reading tarots in use today derive from the French Tarot de Marseille). On the other hand, "playing tarots", especially those of France and the Germanic regions, had by the end of the 19th century evolved into a form more resembling the modern playing card deck, with corner indices and easily identifiable number and court cards. The use of the traditional characters cards for the trumps was largely discarded in favor of more whimsical scenes. The [[Tarot Nouveau]] is an example of the current style of playing tarot, though the artwork and design of this deck can be traced back to the 1890s. The Italian and Spanish Tarocchi decks, however, have largely kept the traditional character identifications of each trump, as well as the Latin suits, though these decks are used almost exclusively for gaming. Tarocco Bolognese and Tarocco Piedmontese are examples of Italian-suited playing tarot decks.

Sets consisting of 56 Tarot playing card have 14 cards of each suit: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.

[[Image:Carte bergamasche.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A set of Carte Bergamasche]]
===Italian===
Italian playing cards most commonly consist of a deck of 40 cards (4 suits going 1 to 7 plus 3 face cards), and are used for playing Italian regional games such as [[Scopa]] or [[Briscola]]. 52 (or more rarely 36) card sets are also found in the north. Since these cards first appeared in the late 14th century when each region in Italy was a separately ruled province, there is no official Italian pattern. There are sixteen official regional patterns in use in different parts of the country (about one per [[Regions of Italy|region]]). These sixteen patterns are split amongst four regions:
* Northern Italian Suits <U+2014> [[Trieste|Triestine]], [[Treviso|Trevigiane]], [[Trento|Trentine]], Primiera [[Bologna|Bolognese]], [[Bergamo|Bergamasche]], [[Brescia]]ne
* Spanish-like Suits <U+2014> [[Naples|Napoletane]], [[Sardinia|Sarde]], [[Romagna|Romagnole]], [[Sicily|Siciliane]], [[Piacenza|Piacentine]].
* French Suits <U+2014> [[Genoa|Genovesi]], [[Lombardy|Lombarde]] or [[Milan]]esi, [[Tuscany|Toscane]], [[Piedmont|Piemontesi]].
* German Suits <U+2014> [[Salzburg|Salisburghesi]] used in [[South Tyrol]]

The suits are coins (sometimes suns or sunbursts) ('''Denari''' in Italian), swords ('''Spade'''), cups ('''Coppe''') and clubs (sometimes batons '''Bastoni'''), and each suit contains an ace (or one), numbers two through seven, and three face cards. The face cards are:
* Re (''king''), the highest valued&nbsp;<U+2014> a man standing, wearing a crown
* Cavallo (lit. ''horse'') [italo-Spanish suits] <U+2014> a man sitting on a horse / or Donna (lit. ''woman'' from Latin ''domina'' = ''mistress'') [French suits] <U+2014> a standing woman with a crown
* Fante (lit. ''infantry soldier'') <U+2014> a younger figure standing, without a crown

The Spanish-like-suit knave (''fante'' - the lowest face card) is depicted as a woman, and is sometimes referred to as ''donna'' like the next higher face card of the French-suit deck; this, when coupled with the French usage, which puts a queen, also called ''donna'' (woman) in Italian and not ''regina'' (queen), as the mid-valued face card, can very occasionally lead to a swap of the value of the French-suit ''donna'' (or more rarely of the international-card Queen) and the knave (or jack).

Unlike Anglo-American cards, some Italian cards do not have any numbers (or letters) identifying their value. The cards' value is determined by identifying the face card or counting the number of suit characters.

===Spanish===
[[Image:Spanish deck printed in Valencia, in 1778.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Replica of a Spanish deck printed in Valencia, in 1778.]]

The traditional [[Baraja (playing cards)|Spanish deck]] (referred to as ''baraja espa<U+00F1>ola'' in Spanish) uses Latin suit symbols. Being a [[Latin suited cards|Latin-suited deck]] (like the Italian deck), it is organized into four ''palos'' (suits) that closely match those of the Italian-suited Tarot deck: ''oros'' ("golds" or coins), ''copas'' (beakers or cups), ''espadas'' (swords) and ''bastos'' (batons or clubs). Certain decks include two "comodines" ([[joker (playing card)|jokers]]) as well.

The cards (''cartas'' in Spanish) are all numbered, but unlike in the standard Anglo-French deck, the card numbered 10 is the first of the court cards (instead of a card depicting ten coins/cups/swords/batons); so each suit has only twelve cards. The three court or face cards in each suit are as follows: ''la sota'' ("the knave" or jack, numbered 10 and equivalent to the Anglo-French card J), ''el caballo'' ("the horse", horseman, knight or cavalier, numbered 11 and used instead of the Anglo-French card Q; note the Tarot decks have both a queen and a knight of each suit, while the Anglo-French deck uses the former, and the Spanish deck uses the latter), and finally ''el rey'' ("the king", numbered 12 and equivalent to the Anglo-French card K). However, most Spanish games involve forty-card decks, with the 8s and 9s removed, similar to the standard Italian deck.

The box that goes around the figure has a mark to distinguish the suit without showing all of your cards: The cups have one interruption, the swords two, the clubs three, and the gold none. This mark is called "la pinta" and gave rise to the expression: ''le conoc<U+00ED> por la pinta'' ("I knew him by his markings").
[[File:Baraja-40-cards.jpg|thumb|250px|Spanish deck.]]
The Baraja have been widely considered to be part of the occult in many Latin-American countries, yet they continue to be used widely for card games and gambling, especially in Spain, which does not use the Anglo-French deck. Among other places, the Baraja have appeared in ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' and other Hispanic and Latin American literature. The Spanish deck is used not only in Spain, but also in other countries where Spain maintained an influence (''e.g.'', [[Mexico]], [[Chile]] [[Argentina]] and most of [[Hispanic America]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Puerto Rico]]) [http://www.pagat.com/class/latin.html 1]. Among the games played with this deck are: ''el [[mus (card game)|mus]]'' (a very popular and highly regarded [[vying game]] of [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] origin), ''[[briscola|la brisca]]'', ''la [[pocha]]'', ''el [[tute]]'' (with many variations), ''el [[gui<U+00F1>ote]]'', ''la [[escoba]] del quince'' (a [[trick-taking game]]), ''el [[julepe]]'', ''el [[cinquillo (card game)|cinquillo]]'', ''las [[siete y media]]'', ''la [[mona (card game)|mona]]'', ''el truc'' (or ''[[truco]]''), ''el [[cuajo]]'' (a [[matching card game|matching]] game from the Philippines), ''el [[Jam<U+00F3>n (game)|jam<U+00F3>n]]'', ''el [[Tonto (card game)|tonto]]'', ''el [[hijoputa]]'', ''el [[mentiroso]]'', ''el [[cuco]]'', ''las [[parejas]]'' and ''las [[cuarenta]]'' (a [[Card game#Fishing games|fishing game]], the national card game of [[Ecuador]]).

In Spain, games of Anglo-American origin such as poker and blackjack are played with the international 52-card deck, which is called a ''baraja de poker''.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the national game is [[Jass]]. It is played with decks of 36 cards. West of the [[Br<U+00FC>nig-Napf-Reuss line]], a French-style 36-card deck is used, with numbers from 6 to 10, Jacks, Queens, Kings and Aces. The same kind of deck is used in [[Graub<U+00FC>nden]] and in parts of [[Thurgau]].
[[image:Schafkopf_Tarock_bayerisches_Bild.jpg|thumb|250px|Bavarian playing cards]]
In [[Central Switzerland]], [[Canton of Z<U+00FC>rich|Zurich]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]] and [[Eastern Switzerland]], the prevalent deck consists of 36 playing cards with the following suits: Roses, Bells, Acorns and Shields (in German: Rosen, Schellen, Eichel und Schilten). The ranks of the alternate deck, from low to high, are: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ("Banner"), ''Unter'' (lower jack), ''Ober'' (higher jack), King and Ace.

===German===
[[File:Skatblatt_Turnierbild.jpg|thumb|250px|Official Skat tournament deck. Pictures and symbols look like the French deck, suit colours however are changed.]]
[[Germany|German]] suits may have different appearances. Many Eastern and Southern Germans prefer decks with Hearts, Bells, Leaves, and Acorns (for Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, and Clubs), as mentioned above. In the game [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[German Democratic Republic|East German]] players used the German deck, while players in Western Germany mainly used the French deck. After the reunification a compromise deck was created for official Skat tournaments, with French symbols but German colors (green Spades and yellow Diamonds).<ref name=pcg1>[http://playingcards.freewebpages.org/cards19.htm Andy's Playing Cards - Shapes, Sizes and Colors]</ref> [[Bavarian]] playing cards (dvouhlav<U+00E9> hrac<U+00ED> karty in Czech) are also widespread in the Czech Republic.

===Central European=== <!-- [[William tell (play)]] links here -->
The cards of [[Culture of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Culture of Austria|Austria]], [[Culture of Slovenia|Slovenia]], the [[Culture of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], Northern [[Culture of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Culture of Slovakia|Slovakia]], Western [[Culture of Romania|Romania]], [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]] in [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[Vojvodina]] in [[Culture of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[South Tyrol]]
use the same suits (Hearts, Bells, Leaves and Acorns) as the cards of Southern and Eastern Germany. They usually have a deck of 32 or 36 cards. The numbering includes VII, VIII, IX, X, Under, Over, King and Ace. Some variations with 36 cards have also the number VI. The VI in bells also has the function like a [[joker (playing card)|joker]] in some games and it is named ''Welli'' or ''Weli''.

These cards are illustrated with a special picture series that was born in the times before the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], when revolutionary movements were awakening all over in Europe. The Aces show the four [[season]]s: the Ace of Hearts is Spring, the Ace of Bells is Summer, the Ace of Leaves is Autumn and the Ace of Acorns is Winter. The characters of the Under and Over cards were taken from the drama ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'', the legendary Swiss freedom fighter, written by [[Friedrich Schiller]] in 1804, which was shown at Kolozsv<U+00E1>r, [[Hungary]] (now [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]) in 1827. It was long believed that the card was invented in [[Vienna]] at the Card Painting Workshop of [[Ferdinand Piatnik]], however in 1974 the very first deck was found in an English private collection, and it has shown the name of the inventor and creator of deck as J<U+00F3>zsef Schneider, a Master Card Painter at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], and the date of its creation as 1837. Had he not chosen the Swiss characters of Schiller's play, had he chosen Hungarian heroes or freedom fighters, his deck of cards would never have made it into distribution, due to the heavy censorship of [[Austria-Hungary|the government at the time]]. Interestingly, although the characters on the cards are Swiss, these cards are unknown in Switzerland.

Games that are played with this deck in Hungary include [[Skat (card game)|Skat]], [[Ulti]] (aka Ultim<U+00F3>), [[Snapszer]] (or 66), [[Zs<U+00ED>roz<U+00E1>s]], Fire, [[Prefer<U+00E1>nsz]], [[Maka<U+00F3>]], [[L<U+00F3>rum]], [[Piros pacsi]] (Red paw), [[Piros papucs]] (Red slipper) and [[<U+00D6>tlead<U+00E1>s]]. In [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] these cards are also commonly used for a game called [[Belot]] (also popular in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Armenia]]). 

In Czech republic these cards are called ''mari<U+00E1><U+0161>ky'' or ''mari<U+00E1><U+0161>ov<U+00E9> karty'' (both means ''cards for Mari<U+00E1><U+0161>''), or sometimes ''pikety''. The cards are used for almost all common card games in Czech lands, including the most famous [[Sechsundsechzig|Mari<U+00E1><U+0161>]], and very popular games like [[Mau Mau (card game)|pr<U+0161><U+00ED>]] or ''Oko bere'' (slightly different Czech version of [[Blackjack]]).

The most common game played in Western Romania (Transylvania and Banat) is [[Cruce]], a variation of Snapszer, most commonly played in 2 pairs, with team members facing each other, hence the name (Cruce = Romanian for ''Cross'').

===Russia===
In Russia and many countries of the former USSR, the Russian 36-card deck is the most common one. Its numbering includes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Valet (Jack), Dama (Queen), Korol (King) and Tuz (Ace). The suits are identical to French ones. This deck is used for several Russian card games such as ''[[Durak]]'' or ''Ochko'' (a variant of Blackjack).
Another common Russian deck is the Preferans deck that is used for the card [[Preferans|game of the same name]]. It begins with sevens and is identical to the Piquet deck.

===East Asia===
The standard 52-card deck is commonly known as a "poker" deck in [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[South Korea]]. Alternatively, a more common name in Japan and Korea for the same deck is trump (<U+30C8><U+30E9><U+30F3><U+30D7> torampu, <U+D2B8><U+B7FC><U+D504> teureompeu respectively) which comes from the term [[trump card]]. These cards are most often used for [[baccarat]] and [[blackjack]] in casinos, or deciding the order of play or challenge in games of billiards. Poker itself and other western games are relatively unknown; however, there do exist East Asian games using the poker deck, such as [[Daifugo]] and [[Two-ten-jack]]. Home and online card games in east Asia such as Koi-Koi and Go-Stop use a [[Karuta]], such as [[hanafuda]], [[uta-garuta]] or [[kabufuda]] deck in Japan, and the equivalent [[hwatu]] deck in Korea.

===Mongolia===
Mongolia's most popular card game is called ''Muushigand''.  It uses a 32-card deck in four suits with the ranks in order from lowest to highest being 7, 8, 9, 10, <U+0411><U+043E><U+043E><U+043B> (Jack), <U+0425><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D> (Queen), <U+041D><U+043E><U+0451><U+043D> (King) and <U+0422><U+0430><U+043C><U+0433><U+0430> (Ace).  For 2 or 5 players, all 32 cards are used, but for 3 players, only 24 are used, and for four players, 28.

The game starts with each player at a score of 15.  The object of each round is to win as many tricks as possible.
If a player wins no tricks, his score is increased by 5.  The player who first reaches 0 points or less wins the game.

===India===
Playing cards is a common pastime in India. Playing cards are referred to as [[Taash]] in the language Hindi. The most popular card game in India is [[Indian Rummy]]. There are several popular card games in India including Bluff, Twenty nine, Bridge etc.

===Accessible playing cards===
Playing cards have been adapted for use by the [[visually impaired]] by the inclusion of [[large-print]] and/or [[braille]] characters as part of the card. Both standard card decks and decks for specific games such as [[Uno (card game)|UNO]] are commonly adapted. Large-print cards are also commonly used by the elderly. In addition to increasing the size of the suit symbol and the denomination text, large-print cards commonly reduce the visual complexity of the images for simpler identification. They may also omit the patterns of pips in favor of one large pip to identify suit. Oversize cards are sometimes used but are uncommon. These can assist with ease of handling and to allow for larger text.

No universal standards for braille playing cards exist. There are many national and producer variations. In most cases each card is marked with two braille characters in the same location as the normal corner markings. The two characters can appear in either vertical (one character below another) or horizontal (two characters side by side). In either case one character identifies the card ''suit'' and the other the card ''denomination''. 1 for ''ace'', 2 through 9 for the numbered cards, X or the letter O for ten, J for ''jack'', Q for ''queen'', K for ''king''. The suits are variously marked using D for ''diamond'', S for ''spade'', C or X for ''club'' and H or K for ''heart''.

==Production techniques==
The typical production process for a new deck starts with the choice between the most suitable material: [[card stock]] or [[plastic]].

Cards are printed on unique sheets that undergo a varnishing procedure in order to enhance the brightness and glow of the colors printed on the cards, as well as to increase their durability.

In today<U+2019>s market, some high-quality products are available. There are some specific treatments on card surfaces, such as [[calendering]] and linen finishing, that guarantee performance for either professional or domestic use.

The cards are printed on sheets, which are cut and arranged in bands (vertical stripes) before undergoing a cutting operation that cuts out the individual cards. After assembling the new decks, they pass through the corner-rounding process that will confer the final outline: the typical rectangular playing-card shape.

Finally, each deck is wrapped in [[cellophane]], inserted in its case and is ready for the final distribution.
