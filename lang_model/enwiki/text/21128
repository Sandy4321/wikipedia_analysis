The '''music of Paraguay''' has a long history.

==Folk music==

The [[Paraguayan polka]] combines ternary and binary rhythms, whereas the European only uses binary. The most famous style of music is the [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]], created by the Paraguayan musician [[Jos<U+00E9> Asunci<U+00F3>n Flores]] in 1925. The Guarania accomplishes this by using a combination of slow rhythms and melodies of [[melancholia]] character. Other popular genres of traditional music in Paraguay are the [[zarzuela]] and the "Paraguayan Songs", which are derived from the Paraguayan polka.<ref>South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean (Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Volume 2) Publisher: Routledge; Har/Com edition (October 1, 1998)

===Instruments===
The Spanish [[guitar]] and European [[harp]] are among the most popular instruments, while dances include the lively [[polka]] and distinctive [[bottle dance]], which involves the performer twirling a bottle around her head.  Composer and guitarist [[Agust<U+00ED>n Barrios]] is perhaps the country's best known export.

====Paraguayan harp====
The Paraguayan harp deserves special mention as a popular instrument with a national style associated with it. The harp in South America dates back to at least 1556-7, possibly as early as the beginning of the 16th century. These harps had 26 to 38 strings, though most typically no fewer than 36. It was frequently used in church music in place of the [[organ (musical instrument)|organ]] or [[harpsichord]]. The Paraguayan harp is a simplified variation of the instrument, with 38 strings tuned to one major diatonic scale.

===Rock===

Several world-popular genres of music, such as [[rock music|rock]] are fairly new in the Paraguayan music scene. This is because of the fierce [[dictatorship]] enforced by former President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] during his mandate from 1954 to 1989, in which he banned all forms of liberal expressions. Despite that, a few rock groups were formed in the 1970s such as ''The Aftermad's'' and ''The Blue Caps''. It wasn't until Stroessner's downfall in 1989 that rock groups emerged. In the 1990s groups such as Chris Patik, Enemigos de la Klase, Deliverans, El Templo, Dogma, Sham<U+00E1>n, Turkish Blend and [[Slow Agony]] became popular. In the new millennium, Paraguayan rock bands have gained a strong following thanks to the big rock festivals such as "Pilsen Rock" and "Quilmes Rock", which gather around 60,000 spectators for every edition. The bands have even gathered some international success by touring throughout [[Latin America]] and even making small [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]s in the [[United States]]. The most popular rock bands as of now are [[Rolando Chaparro]], [[Flou]], [[Revolber]], [[Ripe Banana Skins]], [[Area 69 (Band)|Area 69]], [[Paiko (band)|Paiko]], [[Salamandra (Band)|Salamandra]], [[Gaia (band)|Gaia]], and NOD. The real rock bands are 220 Voltios, Sucios y Desprolijos, Steinkrug, Linaje, Black Manzana, and Alto Voltaje.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Classical music===
The main exponents are [[Agust<U+00ED>n Barrios Mangor<U+00E9>]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Asunci<U+00F3>n Flores]] and [[Juan Carlos Moreno]]. Silva studied abroad and reproduced, in the guarani vocal form, the indigenous music, based on the European technique. Moreno composed works inspired on popular themes in a romantic classical path.<ref>Monitor. Enciclopedia Salvat para todos. ISBN 84-7137-223-1 (1965)</ref>
