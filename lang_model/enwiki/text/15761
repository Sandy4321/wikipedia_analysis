'''Tom Boric''' is a former [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] better known as '''Paul Diamond''' who is best known being one half of the tag team <U+201C>Badd Company<U+201D> with [[Pat Tanaka]] and for his time in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] as '''Kato''', one half of [[The Orient Express]] also with Pat Tanaka.

==Career==
Boric was born in [[Yugoslavia]] (the region now known as [[Croatia]]) in 1961 and grew up wanting to follow in his father<U+2019>s footsteps and become a [[Association football|soccer]] player. When Boric was 13 years old the family emigrated from Croatia to [[Canada]], settling down in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. Tom got a full soccer scholarship to [[Old Dominion University]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].<ref name="Canoe">{{cite web| url = http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBios/diamond.html | title = Paul Diamond returns to his roots | accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Doug Lunney (Winnipeg Sun)}}</ref> After only three semesters at college, Tom got drafted to play [[goalkeeper]] for the recently formed [[Calgary Boomers]] of the [[North American Soccer League]]. After the Boomers folded in 1981, Boric moved on to the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975-1993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] whom he played for until the NASL closed in 1984.<ref name="Canoe"/>

After his professional soccer career ended, Boric began training for a professional wrestling career at a [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]] wrestling school run by [[Boris Malenko]] along with his two sons [[Joe Malenko]] and [[Dean Malenko]] who all had a hand in training him.<ref name="Canoe"/After training, Boric began wrestling as "Paul Diamond" in 1985. His first break came in the Texas All-Star Wrestling promotion in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. Initially he formed a tag team called "American Breed" with [[Nick Kiniski]] (son of legendary wrestler [[Gene Kiniski]]). Neither Diamond and Kiniski were actually American, (Diamond is Coatian/Canadian while  Kiniski is Canadian) so the team name was quite ironic.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/tasw/tasw3.htm | title = Texas All-Star Wrestling part 3 | accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Chuck Merkich | quote = American Force, which consisted of Paul Diamond and Nick Kiniski, who were ironically, both Canadians.}}</ref> The team won the [[Texas All-Star USA Tag Team Championship|TASW Tag Team Championship]] from the Maoris (Tudui and Wakahi) on [[May 25]], 1985 and held them until [[Alberto Madril|Al Madrill]] and [[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.|Chavo Guerrero]] took the titles from them on [[June 5]], 198.5<ref name="Titles">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories  | publisher=Archeus Communications  | year=4th Edition 2006 | isbn=0-9698161-5-4 }}</ref> The titles would be vacated later that same month when Chavo Guerrero refused to wrestle in a rematch against Diamond and Kiniski because Chavo<U+2019>s father [[Gory Guerrero]] was the special referee chosen for the match. Madrill teamed up with Black Gorman instead but lost the match. After the match, Madrill attacked Chavo Guerrero splitting the team and forcing the titles to be held up. When Madrill won the rights to name a new partner he chose to give the titles to <U+201D>American Breed<U+201D> instead, only now American Breed consisted of Paul Diamond and a rookie named [[Shawn Michaels]],<ref name="HBK">{{cite book | author= [[Shawn Michaels]] & Aaron Feigenbaum | title= Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story  | publisher= WWE Books| year= 2005| isbn=978-1416516866}}</ref> as Kiniski had left the promotion a few weeks prior.<ref name="Titles"/> Diamond and Michaels lost and then regained the titles from the <U+201C>Masked Hoods<U+201D> ([[Aldo Ortiz|Ricky Santana]] and Tony Torres)<ref name="Titles"/> before being beaten for the titles on [[January 27]], [[1986]] by Al Madrill and Magnificent Zulu.<ref name="Titles"/> Both Michaels and Diamond began to add more to their wrestling skills, thanks in part to fellow wrestler [[Chris Adams (wrestler)|Chris Adams]], who split his time between [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] and Texas All-Star at the time.

===Badd Company===
In 1986, Diamond moved on to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] where he worked for [[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Jerry Jarrett]]<U+2019>s [[Continental Wrestling Association]]. In the fall of 1986 Diamond teamed up with a young [[Jeff Jarrett]] to win the [[CWA/AWA International Tag Team Championship]] from [[Tarzan Goto]] and [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Akio Sato]] on [[November 3]], 1986. The team lost the titles back to Goto and Sato less than 2 weeks later.<ref name="Titles"/> In late 1986, the tag team specialist Diamond was teamed up with [[Pat Tanaka]], who was also seen as a tag team specialist, to form <U+201C>Badd Company".<ref name="Tag">{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005| isbn=978-1-5502-2683-6}}</ref> They held the federation's tag team titles four times and the two won the CWA/AWA International Tag Team Championship, beating Tarzan Goto and Akio Sato on [[December 15]], [[1986]]. The first reign was short lived as [[The Bushwhackers]] ([[Brian Wickens|Luke Williams]] and [[Butch Miller (wrestler)|Butch Miller]]) defeated the young duo on [[January 10]], [[1987]].<ref name="Titles"/> Badd Company quickly regained the titles only to lose them to Tarzan Goto and Akio Sato on [[February 5]], [[1987]].<ref name="Titles"/> The third run with the tag team titles came on [[May 9]], 1987 when the team beat Mark Starr in a handicap match,<ref name="Titles"/> but lost them back to Mark Starr and his new tag team partner Billy Joe Travis. Badd Company had one last run with the International tag team titles as they won the vacant titles on [[May 25]], 1987<ref name="Titles"/> and held them until [[July 6]], 1987 where they lost the titles to [[Bill Dundee]] and [[Rocky Johnson]] (who were the last International tag team champions).

Badd Company also won the CWA<U+2019>s main tag team titles in Memphis, when they defeated Jeff Jarrett and Billy Joe Travis for the [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship]] on [[August 8]], 1987.<ref name="Titles"/> Tanaka and Diamond soon lost them as [[the Nasty Boys]] took the gold from them just over a month later<ref name="Titles"/>.

===AWA===
After working as a team for almost a year, Badd Company moved on from the CWA to the [[American Wrestling Association]]. In the AWA they were given identical ring gear, and were accompanied by flamboyant manager [[Diamond Dallas Page]], who always had a number of valets, known as [[The Diamond Dolls]], with him.<ref name="Tag"/>

The team's first feud was against [[The Rockers|The Midnight Rockers]], whom they defeated for the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]] on [[March 19]] [[1988]]<ref name="Titles"/>. During their year long title reign, Badd Company would feud heavily with [[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.|Chavo]] and [[Mando Guerrero]] and the team known as '''Top Gun''' ([[Ricky Rice]] and [[Derrick Dukes]]). They teamed with [[Debra Miceli|Madusa Miceli]] to face the team of Top Gun and [[Wendi Richter]] at the only AWA PPV,  [[SuperClash#SuperClash III|SuperClash III]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/awa/superclash.html#sc3 | title = AWA SuperClash Results (III) | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> Both Badd Company<U+2019>s Tag Team Title and Wendi Richter<U+2019>s [[AWA World Women's Championship]] were on the line, but since Richter pinned Miceli, Badd Company remained the champions. Diamond and Tanaka<U+2019>s reign ended on [[March 25]], [[1989]] as they lost to <U+201C>the Olympians" ([[Brad Rheingans]] and [[Ken Patera]]).<ref name="Titles"/> Shortly after losing their titles they split from Page, and had a short feud against each other before wrestling in singles competition until early 1990.

===WWF===
Diamond signed with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1990, working mainly on the lower card against a rookie [[Dustin Rhodes]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1990 | accessdate =2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (September 21, 1990) Dustin Rhodes pinned Paul Diamond at 7:03 with a flying forearm and an elbow drop}}</ref> [[Hillbilly Jim]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1990 | accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (March 22, 1990) Hillbilly Jim pinned Paul Diamond}}</ref> and [[Al Perez]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1990 | accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (March 24, 1990) Al Perez pinned Paul Diamond}}</ref> usually in a losing role. When Akio Sato decided to leave the US wrestling scene in the later days of 1990, it left Pat Tanaka without a partner in [[The Orient Express]]. The WWF decided to reunite the team known as [[Badd Company]], only this time with Paul Diamond wearing a mask to hide the fact that he was not [[Asian people|Asian]] and using the name of Kato,<ref name="Tag"/> During this time, the team had a very well received match with their old enemies the Rockers at the [[Royal Rumble (1991)|1991 Royal Rumble]] <ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#91 | title = WWF Royal Rumble Results (1991) | accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> and another good match against the [[The Hart Foundation#The New Foundation|New Foundation]] at the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]] <ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#92 | title = WWF Royal Rumble Results (1992) | accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref>  <U+2013> which were the only two PPV appearances for the New Orient Express.

Sato briefly rejoined the team in 1991 to team with Tanaka and Kato for a series of 6-man tag-team matches on WWF house shows,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1991 | accessdate=2007-04-03| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = Ricky Steamboat, Davey Boy Smith, & Kerry Von Erich defeated the Orient Express (Kato, Tanaka, & Sato) (w/ Mr. Fuji) when Steamboat pinned Kato with the flying crossbody at 10:28}}</ref> but left the WWF after only a handful of matches. Tanaka would leave the WWF in early 1992.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1992 | accessdate=2007-04-03| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = February 17, 1992: Virgil defeated Pat Tanaka via submission with the Million $ Dream at 7:16 (this was Tanaka<U+2019>s last match in the WWF)}}</ref>

=== Max Moon ===
In the fall of 1992, Diamond got a brand new [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] in "Maximillian Moon" ("Max Moon" for short). Diamond wasn<U+2019>t originally intended to play Max Moon. It was a gimmick created for [[Konnan]], but Konnan left the WWF after a backstage disagreement. Since Diamond fit the costume, he was chosen to take over the character.<ref name="WrestleCrap">{{cite book | author=[[RD Reynolds]] and Randy Baer | title=Wrestlecrap <U+2013> the very worst of pro wrestling | publisher=ECW Press| year=2003 | isbn=1-55022-584-7 }}</ref> The suit was a very elaborate powder blue bodysuit with markings that were supposed to look like a [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] and white protruding rings around his arms making him look rather <U+201D>outlandish. <ref >{{cite book | author=[[RD Reynolds]] and Randy Baer | title=Wrestlecrap <U+2013> the very worst of pro wrestling | publisher=ECW Press| year=2003 | isbn=1-55022-584-7 | quote = weird rings around his it<U+2019>s arms, making Diamond look as though he was ribbed like one of those condoms <U+201C>made for her pleasure<U+201D> | page=164}}</ref> The elaborate outfit also came with two wrist devices that shot out fireworks and a [[jet pack]] that was supposed to make Max Moon look like a man of the future. 

Diamond made his debut on [[September 2]], 1992, introduced initially as <U+201D>The Comet Kid<U+201D>, defeating perennial [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]] [[Duane Gill]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1992 | accessdate =2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = September 2, 1992: The Comet Kid (Max Moon) pinned Duane Gill at 1:54 with a running fireman's carry into a forward roll )}}</ref> The <U+201C>Comet Kid<U+201D> name only stuck for one appearance as he was introduced as <U+201C>Maximilian Moon<U+201D> the next time he wrestled.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1992 | accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = September 1, 1992: Max Moon pinned Jerry Fox at 2:35 with a fireman's carry into a forward roll (1st time the Comet Kid is referred to as Max Moon)}}</ref> Diamond (as Max Moon) would wrestle and defeat [[Terry Taylor]] in a series of house show matches during the rest of 1992, but otherwise, his biggest victories came against [[Rick Martel]]<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1992 | accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = September 22, 1992: Max Moon defeated Rick Martel via disqualification at 6:00 when the referee saw Martel using the tights for leverage}}</ref> and [[Barry Darsow|Repo Man]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/92.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1992 | accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = October 13, 1992: Max Moon defeated Repo Man via disqualification when Repo used his bull rope}}</ref> both by disqualification.

=== ECW ===
Diamond and Pat Tanaka reunited as <U+201C>Badd Company" to work for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|Eastern Championship Wrestling]] (the forerunner to <U+201C>Extreme Championship Wrestling") in late 1993. The team made their debut at ''NWA Bloodfest: Part 1'' on [[October 1]], [[1993]] where they beat "Bad Breed" ([[Ian Rotten|Ian]] and [[Axl Rotten]]).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1993d.html#100193 | title = ECW Show Results October <U+2013> December 1993 | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> Tanaka and Diamond got a shot at the [[ECW Tag Team Championship|ECW Tag Team Champions]] [[Tony Stetson]] and Johnny Hotbody later in the night, which Badd Company lost.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1993d.html#100193 | title = ECW Show Results October <U+2013> December 1993 | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

The next night at ''NWA Bloodfest: Part 2'', Badd Company fought against [[The Public Enemy (professional wrestling)|Public Enemy]] ([[Rocco Rock]] and [[Johnny Grunge]]) in one of their very early matches.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1993d.html#100293 | title = ECW Show Results October <U+2013> December 1993 | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> Later in the show, Badd Company and the Public Enemy would clash again, this time in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Multi-competitor match variations|Three way]], [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] that also included Bad Breed.

As 1993 turned to 1994, Badd Company set their sights on ECW Tag Team Champions [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] and [[Tazz|The Tasmaniac]]; they defeated them twice in non-title matches.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1994a.html#010894| title = ECW Show Results January <U+2013> March 1994 | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ecw/results/1994a.html#010894| title = ECW Show Results January <U+2013> March 1994 | accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref> At "The Night the Line was Crossed" on [[February 5]], 1994, Tanaka and his one night only partner [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]] defeated Sullivan and The Tasmaniac.

=== WCW ===
By the time Badd Company wrestled its last match for ECW, Tanaka and Diamond had already signed with [[World Championship Wrestling]]; Tanaka had even made his on screen debut as <U+201C>Tanaka-San".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm | title = WCW Show Results 1994| accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = March 24, 1994: WCW US Champion Steve Austin defeated Tanaka-san}}</ref> Paul Diamond showed up with the Kato mask on using the name <U+201C>Haito" (sometimes spelled "Hyeeto") only days after their last ECW match.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw94.htm | title = WCW Show Results 1994| accessdate=2007-04-07| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = March 30, 1994: Arn Anderson defeated Hyeeto (Paul Diamond) via disqualification when Tanaka-san interfered}}</ref> The duo reprized their <U+201C>Orient Express" gimmick but could not use the name since the WWF owned the copyright to it.

Diamond worked for Jerry Lawler<U+2019>s promotions in Memphis after working for WCW, first for the [[United States Wrestling Association]] where he held the [[USWA World Tag Team Championship]] alongside [[Steve Doll|Steven Dunn]] <ref name="Titles"/>.
