== Career biography ==
While sick with strep throat as a child, Jim Butcher's sisters introduced him to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[List of Star Wars books|The Han Solo Adventures]]'' novels to pass the time, thus beginning his fascination with fantasy and [[science fiction]].<ref name="Dead Beat">{{cite book

Tolkien]], [[Lloyd Alexander]], and [[C.S. Lewis]], among others, as major influences),<ref name="Dead Beat" /> he wrote the first book in ''The Dresden Files''<U+2014>about a professional [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] in modern-day [[Chicago]]<U+2014>as an exercise for a writing course in 1996 at the age of 25.

For two years, Butcher floated his manuscript amongst various publishers before hitting the convention circuit to make contacts in the industry. After meeting Butcher in person, Ricia Mainhardt, the agent who discovered [[Laurell K. Hamilton]], agreed to represent him, kick-starting his writing career.<ref name="about jim">{{cite web

In addition, he contributed a short story for publication in ''My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding'' with [[Charlaine Harris]] and [[Sherrilyn Kenyon]], among others, scheduled for release in October 2006.

=== The Dresden Files series ===
Six months after Butcher was signed by Mainhardt, ''[[Storm Front]]'', the first novel in ''The Dresden Files'', was picked up by [[ROC (publisher)|ROC]] for publishing. It was released as a paperback in April of 2000. ''Fool Moon'' followed nine months later on January 1, 2001, and the third book, ''Grave Peril'', appeared on store shelves in September of that year. Thereafter, the release schedule slowed, with ''Summer Knight'' appearing on September 3, 2002. The fifth and sixth books, ''Death Masks'' and ''Blood Rites'', appeared in August of 2003 and 2004, respectively. Coinciding with the release of ''Blood Rites'', Butcher published a Harry Dresden short story, entitled ''Restoration of Faith'', on his website, chronicling Harry's life before ''The Dresden Files'' as a private eye for Ragged Angel Investigations.<ref name="restoration of faith">{{cite web

=== The Codex Alera series ===
After the success of Dresden, Butcher returned to the traditional fantasy genre with his second series, ''Codex Alera''. The series chronicles the life of a young man named Tavi from the Calderon Valley of Alera on the world of Carna. The people of Alera have grown complacent with the trappings of empire (the story is based loosely on the late [[Roman Empire]]) and their control of powerful elemental forces known as furies. On March 3, 2003, Jim Butcher announced that [[Ace Books|Ace]] won a bidding war against rival publisher [http://www.randomhouse.com/delrey/ Del Ray] for the rights to the series.<ref name="codexalera">{{cite web
