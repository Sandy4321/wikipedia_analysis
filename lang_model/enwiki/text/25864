'''''Adore''''' is the fourth studio [[album]] from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] [[alternative rock]] band [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. [[Virgin Records]] released the album on [[June 2]], [[1998]] in the [[United States]]. ''Adore'' is the Pumpkins' only album not to feature original [[drummer]] [[Jimmy Chamberlin]]. ''Adore'' marked a change in sound for The Smashing Pumpkins; [[Greg Kot]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine noted that the album "isn't just a transitional record; it's a complete break with the past."<ref name="rolling stone review">{{cite web

For the release, the band shed their alternative [[hipster]] image for a more subdued [[Goth subculture|Gothic]] look.

However, the album was well received by critics, and received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Performance|Best Alternative Music Performance]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1999|1999 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> and their first foray into electronic music. The song marked a departure from the typically [[guitar]]-oriented [[alternative rock]] sound of ''[[Gish]]'' and ''[[Siamese Dream]]''. Meanwhile, the band gave interviews stating that ''Mellon Collie'' would be the last conventional Pumpkins record,<ref>Di Perna, Alan. "Zero Worship," ''Guitar World''. December 1995.</ref> and [[James Iha]] later remarked that "The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music."<ref>Graff, Gary. "Smashing Pumpkins<U+2014>Rave of the Future," ''Guitar World''. December 1996.</ref>

Unexpectedly, the band fired drummer Jimmy Chamberlin.<ref name="Eonline">{{cite web

A year later, the Pumpkins released "[[The End is the Beginning is the End]]", a single for the ''[[Batman and Robin]]'' soundtrack, and "[[Eye (song)|Eye]]", a single for the ''[[Lost Highway]]'' soundtrack. Both songs incorporated electronic elements, yet retained the hard rock elements of the band's previous material; one reviewer called the two singles "balls-out, full-energy chargers" and wrote off the Pumpkins' previous remarks that the upcoming album would "rock" less.<ref name="pfork" /> Following the release of the single, The Smashing Pumpkins began to record the follow-up to ''Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness''; one of the best-selling albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web

==Recording==
In August 1997, the remaining band members entered ''Chicago Trax Recording'' and ''Hinge'' in Chicago, with temporary replacement drummer [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] and producer [[Brad Wood]] &mdash;with whom Corgan previously had worked in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web

===Music===
''Adore'' is different in approach and style from previous Pumpkins albums. Distorted guitars are rarely present on the album, only appearing dominantly in the guitar solo for "[[For Martha]]"<ref name="rolling stone review" /> and "[[Ava Adore]]". Corgan explained the new sound by remarking that he was not "talking to teenagers anymore. I'm talking to everyone now. It's a wider dialogue. I'm talking to people who are older than me and younger than me, and our generation as well."<ref name="Starla" />

Piano is present in most songs, particularly "Annie Dog", "For Martha", "Blank Page" and "Crestfallen".<ref name="rolling stone review" /> The track "Appels + Oranjes" is completely [[synthesizer|synthesized]] - performed entirely on electronic instruments apart from Corgan's vocals. The track "Tear" was a song that was left off the ''[[Lost Highway]]'' soundtrack in favour of the electronic song "[[Eye (song)|Eye]]". The unreleased song "Blissed and Gone" is represented only by a brief piano instrumental titled "[[17 (song)|17]]".<ref>{{cite web

Apart from being the first album without Jimmy Chamberlin, ''Adore'' was the first album to not include writing contributions from Iha.<ref name="booklet">''Adore'' booklet and [[liner notes]].</ref> Iha was at the time writing for his solo album ''[[Let It Come Down (James Iha album)|Let It Come Down]]''. However, he did contribute the track "Summer", which was released as a b-side to the single "[[Perfect (song)|Perfect]]". Critic Greg Kot noted that "Iha's quirky guitar accents and Wretzky's unflashy resolve [. . .] give ''Adore'' a warmth and camaraderie no other Pumpkins album can match."<ref name="seeds">Kot, Greg.

The band headed to [[London]] to film a video for the album's first single "Ava Adore". Their highest budgeted video yet, "Ava Adore" featured a large cast of extras and was filmed in one continuous shot. The three Pumpkins showed off a new image adopted for the new album - an almost [[Gothic fashion|Gothic]] look, featuring elegant robes and make-up. While in [[Europe]], The Smashing Pumpkins began their tour for ''Adore'', just before its release, performing on [[BBC]]'s "[[Later with Jools Holland]]".<ref>{{cite web

''Adore'' was released to most of the world on [[June 1]], [[1998]] and in the U.S. on [[June 2]]. Some radio stations even aired the album in its entirety the night before. As was becoming increasingly common with larger bands, the album was leaked on the Internet some weeks before the release. The video for "Perfect" was shot in [[Los Angeles]] in July of 1998.<ref>{{cite web

In America, the Pumpkins did not perform at unconventional venues as they had done on the European and Pacific legs of their tour. However, for the American tour, the Pumpkins donated 100% of the ticket proceeds to charity. In every city they performed in the Pumpkins would pick a local charity and designate it as the recipient of the night's concert. In the end, the Pumpkins, with the help of their fans, raised over $2.8 million for charity.<ref>{{cite web

The new song set was made up mainly of ''Adore'' songs. Although some ''Adore'' songs were played every night or almost every night, others were played sparingly or never at all. No songs prior to ''Mellon Collie'' were performed, which eliminated some of the band's biggest hits including "[[Today (song)|Today]]" and "[[Disarm]]"; however, both "Today" and "Disarm" were eventually performed - acoustically - near the end of the tour, in late 1998.<ref>{{cite web

After eight weeks, it dropped out of the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Top 40. Promotion for ''Adore'' finished by the end of 1998, a particularly short run for an album when considering the 2 year touring and promotion schedule for ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]''. It finished with merely two singles - a third, "[[Crestfallen (song)|Crestfallen]]", was released to radio stations but never released as a commercial single.<ref name="Starla" /> Billy Corgan would later remark that he "tried to take a progressive step with Adore and internally didn't get the support I needed."<ref>{{cite web

''Adore''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lyrics are generally seen as an improvement over the lyrics in previous Smashing Pumpkins albums.

''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. Pg. 80. ISBN 0-306-81271-1</ref> said when reviewing the album, "Either the music on ''Adore'' is strong enough to outweigh the lyrics [. . .] and typically whiny singing, or those lyrics and singing have gotten better. Probably a little of both."<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 83</ref> Later in 2000, DeRogatis told Corgan in an interview, "It's my contention that with ''Adore'' and [follow-up album] ''MACHINA'', you took a big leap forward as a lyricist."<ref>DeRogatis, pg. 88</ref> Ryan Schreiber of [[Pitchfork Media]], who criticized ''Mellon Collie'' as "lyrical rock-bottom,"<ref>{{cite web

In terms of commercialism, ''Adore'' was not a success, especially when compared to the Pumpkins' previous albums ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' and ''[[Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness]]''. Despite this, ''Adore'' still remains a staple of The Smashing Pumpkins' catalogue. Songs from the album were still performed in subsequent tours for ''[[Machina/The Machines of God]]'' with Jimmy Chamberlin who rejoined the band in November 1998.<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Spcrestfallen.jpg|thumb|180px|"Crestfallen" promotional single cover.<!-- FAIR USE of Spcrestfallen.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Spcrestfallen.jpg for rationale -->]]
Art direction for the album is credited to Frank Olinsky, Billy Corgan, and Corgan's then-girlfriend and frequent collaborator [[Yelena Yemchuck]].<ref name="booklet" /> The photography for the album and singles was shot by Yelena Yemchuck.<ref name="booklet" /> The cover of the album, and subsequent singles and radio promo singles all feature a woman in black and white. The vinyl release features a slightly different cover than the CD cover: a different photo of the model, more color and the absence of the album title (although some versions of the cover do show the title). In color, it is evident that the model is seated in a giant [[hibiscus]] flower, something not as apparent on the CD cover. This alternate album cover is similar to the artwork for the "[[Daphne Descends]]" promotional single.

The artwork in the album booklet contains several photographs of the band, as well as a pictures of a goat, buildings, a lone tree, and someone in a window. The band members photos include a shot of them on a grassy hill beneath a bare tree, and a close-up of Corgan, while a photo of D'arcy wearing a sheer blouse reveals her breasts. All of the photos in the booklet are black and white, sometimes placed against a purple background.<ref name="booklet" />
