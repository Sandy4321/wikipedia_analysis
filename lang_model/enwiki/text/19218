The '''Temple Society of Concord''', commonly referred to as Temple Concord, is a [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jewish]] congregation located at 910 Madison Street, [[Syracuse, New York]].

==Early history==

Temple Concord was founded in 1839 by [[History of the Jews in Germany|German immigrants]] drawn to upstate New York by the new [[Erie Canal]]. The small group gathered in a back room of a local store for meetings and worship services. By 1841 they had moved to the second floor of a member<U+2019>s home on Mulberry Street, from where they hired their first religious leader (he was not formally trained or ordained as a rabbi). The group incorporated and first took the name <U+201C>Comrades of Peace<U+201D> and shortly thereafter Keneseth Shalome, which they translated in formal English as Temple Society of Concord.{{citation needed}}

In 1851, the congregation erected its first purpose-built synagogue building at Harrison and Mulberry Streets. The cost was $10,000, a substantial sum at the time.  

The present classical-style sanctuary at the corner of Madison Street and University Avenue, with an attached social hall, was designed by Syracuse-based  architect Alfred Taylor and New york-based consulting architect [[Arnold W. Brunner]]. Construction began in 1910 and the building was dedicated in September 23, 1911.  It was built at a cost of $100,000.<ref name=temple/> The social hall was expanded and a classroom building added in the 1920s. The Hiram and Mabel Weisberg Religious School, designed by Edward C. Roock, was built on the east side of the complex in 1960.

The Benjamin M. Bernstein Memorial Chapel was built ca. 2000 inside the former 1920s education building.  Allen Kosoff was the architect, and John Dobbs designed the stained glass windows. 

The 1910-11 building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 27, 2009.<ref name="weeklyactions">[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/nrlist.htm National Register of Historic Places: Weekly List Actions]</ref>
