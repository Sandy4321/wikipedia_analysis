The '''Dakar-Niger Railway''' connects [[Dakar]], ([[Senegal]]) to [[Koulikoro]], ([[Mali]]). It serves many cities in Senegal (including [[Thi<U+00E8>s]]) and Mali (including [[Kayes]], [[Kita, Mali|Kita]], [[Kati]], [[Bamako]]). The line covers a course of 1,287 km of which 641 km lies in Mali.

== History ==

Construction work on the Dakar-Niger Railway began at the end of the [[19th century]] under the French general [[Joseph Gallieni|Gallieni]], commander of [[French Sudan]]. 

The railroad connected the [[Niger River]] with the port of [[Dakar]], allowing the transport of [[raw material]]s across the globe. The line was completed at the beginning of the 20th century, the Kayes-Koulikoro section being inaugurated in [[1904]], but the final section of line did not open until [[1924]].

In [[1947]], the railroad workers went on a several-month [[strike action|strike]] to obtain the same rights as the French railwaymen.  The successful strike was celebrated as a turning point in the anti-colonial struggle by Senegalese writer [[Ousmane Semb<U+00E8>ne]] in his [[1960]] novel ''[[Les Bouts de bois de Dieu]]''.

With the independence of [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]], after the break-up of the [[Mali Federation]], control of the railroad was divided between two national organisations, the ''[[R<U+00E9>gie des Chemin de fer du Mali]] (RCFM)'' and the ''[[R<U+00E9>gie S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>galaise]]''. 

An agreement between Senegal and Mali in [[1962]] determined the common exploitation of the line by the two railway companies.

== Transrail ==

The difficulties of management and the lack of investment have led to a degradation of the infrastructure and [[rolling stock]] and numerous delays.  In [[October 2003]], Senegal and Mali entrusted the management of the network to a Franco-Canadian consortium, [[Transrail]].

In spite of Transrail's obligation to maintain a passenger service, Transrail intends to concentrate on the transport of [[good (accounting)|goods]].  Many stations have been closed and the numbers of connections reduced, creating difficulties for isolated communities.
