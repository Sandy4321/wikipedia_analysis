A '''personal computer [[game]]''' (also known as a '''computer game''' or simply '''PC game''') is a [[video game]] played on a [[personal computer]], rather than on a [[video game console]] or [[arcade machine]]. Computer games have evolved from the simple graphics and gameplay of early titles like ''[[Spacewar!]]'', to a wide range of more visually advanced titles.<ref name="ESApressrelease">{{cite press release | title = Computer and Video Game Software Sales Reach Record $7.3 Billion in 2004| publisher =[[Entertainment Software Association]] | date = January 26, 2005 | url =http://www.theesa.com/archives/2005/02/computer_and_vi.php | accessdate =2006-10-15}}</ref>

PC games are created by one or more [[video game developer|game developer]]s, often in conjunction with other specialists (such as [[game artist]]s) and either published independently or through a third party [[video game publisher|publisher]]. They may then be distributed on physical media such as [[digital versatile disc|DVD]]s and [[compact disc|CD]]s, as Internet-downloadable [[shareware]], or through online delivery services such as [[Direct2Drive]] and [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]]. PC games often require specialized hardware in the user's computer in order to play, such as a specific generation of [[graphics processing unit]] or an [[Internet]] connection for online play, although these [[system requirements]] vary from game to game.

Computer games and [[game addiction]] are often the subject of criticism, focusing largely on the influence of objectionable content and prolonged gameplay on [[minor]]s. The [[Entertainment Software Association]] and other groups maintain that parents are responsible for moderating their children's behaviour, although the controversy has prompted attempts to control the sale of certain games in the [[United States]].<ref name="freespeech">{{cite web| url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060825-7597.html| title = Judge rules against Louisiana video game law| accessdate = 2006-09-02| year = 2006| month = August}}</ref>

==History==

{{main|History of video games}}
===Early growth===
[[Image:Spacewar1.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed for the [[PDP-1]] in 1961, is often credited as being the first ever computer game. The game consisted of two player-controlled spaceships maneuvering around a central star, each attempting to destroy the other.]]
Although personal computers only became popular with the development of the [[microprocessor]], [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[minicomputer]]s, computer gaming has existed since at least the 1960s. One of the first computer games was developed in [[1961]], when [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] students Martin Graetz<!--- "martin graetz used to be a broken link. ---> and [[Alan Kotok]], with MIT employee [[Steve Russell]], developed ''[[Spacewar!]]'' on a [[PDP-1]] computer used for statistical calculations.<ref name="spacewar">{{cite book | author = Levy, Steven | year = 1984 | title = [[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]] | publisher = Anchor Press/Doubleday | id = ISBN 0-385-19195-2 }}</ref>

The first generation of PC games were often [[text game|text adventures]] or [[interactive fiction]], in which the player communicated with the computer by entering commands through a keyboard.  The first text-adventure, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'', was developed for the [[PDP-11]] by Will Crowther in [[1976]], and expanded by Don Woods in [[1977]].<ref name="adventure">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009.html |year=2007 | title=Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original 'Adventure' in Code and in Kentucky |accessdate=2007-09-29|author= Jerz, Dennis | work = Digital Humanities Quarterly}}</ref>   By the 1980s, personal computers had become powerful enough to run games like ''Adventure'', but by this time, graphics were beginning to become an important factor in games.  Later games combined textual commands with basic graphics, as seen in the SSI [[Gold Box]] games such as ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'', or ''[[Bard's Tale (1985)|Bard's Tale]]''.

By the mid-1970s, games were developed and distributed through [[hobbyist]] groups and gaming magazines, such as ''[[Creative Computing]]'' and later ''[[Computer Gaming World]]''. These publications provided game code that could be typed into a computer and played, encouraging readers to submit their own software to competitions.<ref name="codesubmission">{{cite news |title=Computer Gaming World's RobotWar Tournament |url=http://static.filefront.com/cgw/1981_1112_issue1.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[Computer Gaming World]] |page=17 | date=October, 1982 | accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref>

===Industry crash===
{{main|Video game crash of 1983}}
As the video game market became flooded with poor-quality games created by numerous companies attempting to enter the market, and over-production of high profile releases such as the [[Atari 2600]] adaptation of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Atari 2600)|E.T.]]'' and [[Pacman]] grossly underperformed, the popularity of personal computers for education rose dramatically. In 1983, consumer interest in video games dwindled to historical lows, as interest in computer games and the MTV-fueled music industry rose.<ref name="crash">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedoteaters.com/p3_stage6.php |title=Player 3 Stage 6: The Great Videogame Crash |accessdate=2006-08-16 |date=1999-04-07}}</ref>

The effects of the crash were largely limited to the console market, as established companies such as [[Atari]] posted record losses over subsequent years. Conversely, the home computer market boomed, as sales of low-cost colour computers such as the [[Commodore 64]] rose to record highs and developers such as [[Electronic Arts]] benefited from increasing interest in the platform.<ref name="crash" />

The console market experienced a resurgence in the United States with the release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. In Europe, computer gaming continued to boom for many years after.,,<ref name="crash"/>

===New genres===
Increasing adoption of the [[computer mouse]], driven partially by the success of games such as the highly successful ''[[King's Quest]]'' series, and high resolution [[bitmap]] displays allowed the industry to include increasingly high-quality [[GUI|graphical interfaces]] in new releases. Meanwhile, the [[Commodore Amiga]] computer achieved great success in the market from its release in 1985, contributing to the rapid adoption of these new interface technologies.<ref name="amiga">{{cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/amiga1000.html |title=Commodore Amiga 1000 Computer |accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref>

[[Image:Wolfenstein 3D title screen.png|thumb|right|250px|''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', released as [[Personal computer game#Shareware|shareware]] by [[id Software]] in 1992, is widely regarded as having popularised the [[first person shooter]] genre of computer games.]]
Further improvements to game artwork were made possible with the introduction of the first [[sound card]]s, such as [[AdLib]]'s Music Synthesizer Card, in 1987. These cards allowed [[IBM PC compatible]] computers to produce complex sounds using [[FM synthesis]], where they had previously been limited to simple tones and beeps. However, the rise of the [[Creative Labs]] [[Sound Blaster]] card, which featured much higher sound quality due to the inclusion of a [[PCM]] channel and [[digital signal processor]], led AdLib to file for bankruptcy in 1992.

The year before, [[id Software]] had produced one of the first [[first-person shooter]] games, ''[[Hovertank 3D]]'', which was the company's first in their line of highly influential games in the genre. The same team went on to develop ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' in 1992, which helped to popularize the genre, kick-starting a genre that would become one of the highest-selling in modern times.<ref name="fpssales">{{cite web| url =http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8241 | title =Analysts: FPS 'Most Attractive' Genre for Publishers | accessdate =2006-08-17 | last =Cifaldi | first =Frank | date =2006-02-21}}</ref> The game was originally distributed through the [[shareware|shareware distribution model]], allowing players to try a limited part of the game for free but requiring payment to play the rest, and represented one of the first uses of [[texture mapping]] graphics in a popular game, along with ''[[Ultima Underworld]]''.<ref name="texturemapping">{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2003/05/05/doom/index.html?pn=2 |title=Masters of "Doom" |accessdate=2006-09-23 |last=James |first=Wagner}}</ref>

While leading [[Sega]] and [[Nintendo]] console systems kept their CPU speed at 3-7&nbsp;[[clock rate|MHz]], the [[Intel 80486|486]] PC processor ran much faster, allowing it to perform many more calculations per second. The 1993 release of ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' on the PC was a breakthrough in 3D graphics, and was soon ported to various game consoles in a general shift toward greater realism.<ref name="realismshift">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepilgrimage.com/Consolehistory2.htm |title=Console history |accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

Many early PC games included extras such as the peril-sensitive sunglasses that shipped with ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. These extras gradually became less common, but many games were still sold in the traditional over-sized boxes that used to hold the extra "[[feelies]]". Today, such extras are usually found only in Special Edition versions of games, such as Battlechests from [[Blizzard Entertainment| Blizzard ]].<ref name="feelies">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/print/62/11 |title=Feelies |accessdate=2006-09-24 |last=Varney |first=Allen}}</ref>

===Contemporary gaming===
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Cod4 game engine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The high quality graphics of ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare]]'' demonstrate the complex visual effects common in modern PC games.]] -->
By 1996, the rise of [[Microsoft Windows]] and success of 3D console titles such as ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' sparked great interest in [[3D acceleration|hardware accelerated 3D graphics]] on the PC, and soon resulted in attempts to produce affordable solutions with the [[ATI]] ''Rage'', [[Matrox]] ''Mystique'' and [[S3 ViRGE|Silicon Graphics]] ''ViRGE''. [[Tomb Raider]], which was released in 1996, was one of the first third person shooter games and was praised for its revolutionary graphics. As 3D graphics libraries such as [[DirectX]] and [[OpenGL]] matured and knocked proprietary interfaces out of the market, these platforms gained greater acceptance in the market, particularly with their demonstrated benefits in games such as ''[[Unreal]]''.<ref name="unreal">Shamma, Tahsin. [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/unreal/review.html Review of Unreal], Gamespot.com, June 10, 1998.</ref> However, major changes to the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, by then the market leader, made many older [[MS-DOS]]-based games unplayable on [[Windows NT]], and later, [[Windows XP]] (without using an [[emulator]], such as [[DOSbox]]).<ref name="dosincompatibility">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/games/expert/durham_og.mspx |title=Getting Older Games to Run on Windows XP |accessdate=2006-09-22 |last=Durham, Jr. |first=Joel |date=2006-05-14}}</ref>

The faster graphics accelerators and improving [[Central processing unit|CPU]] technology resulted in increasing levels of realism in computer games. During this time, the improvements introduced with products such as [[ATI]]'s [[Radeon R300]] and [[NVidia]]'s [[GeForce 6 Series]] have allowed developers to increase the complexity of modern [[game engine]]s. PC gaming currently tends strongly toward improvements in 3D graphics.<ref name="graphicstrend">{{cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/articles/3D/3DGraphicsTrens.shtm |title=Brief Glimpse into the Future of 3D Game Graphics |accessdate=2006-09-23 |last=Necasek |first=Michal |date=2006-10-30}}</ref>

Unlike the generally accepted push for improved graphical performance, the use of [[physics engine]]s in computer games has become a matter of debate since announcement and 2005 release of the [[AGEIA]] [[PhysX]] [[physics processing unit|PPU]], ostensibly competing with [[middleware]] such as the [[Havok (software)|Havok physics engine]]. Issues such as difficulty in ensuring consistent experiences for all players,<ref name="ppumultiplayer">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060514-6828.html |title=Tim Sweeney ponders the future of physics cards |accessdate=2006-08-22 |last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |date=2006-05-14}}</ref> and the uncertain benefit of first generation PhsyX cards in games such as ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter]]'' and ''[[City of Villains]]'', prompted arguments over the value of such technology.<ref name="grawppubenchmark">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=245 |title=AGEIA PhysX PPU Videos - Ghost Recon and Cell Factor |accessdate=2006-08-22 |last=Shrout |first=Ryan |date=2006-05-02 }}</ref><ref name="covppubenchmark">{{cite web|url=http://anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2828 |title=PhysX Performance Update: City of Villains  |accessdate=2006-09-13 |last=Smith |first=Ryan |date=2006-09-07 }}</ref>

Similarly, many game publishers began to experiment with new forms of marketing. Chief among these alternative strategies is [[Episodic games|episodic gaming]], an adaptation of the older concept of [[expansion pack]]s, in which game content is provided in smaller quantities but for a proportionally lower price. Titles such as ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'' took advantage of the idea, with mixed results rising from concerns for the amount of content provided for the price.<ref name="episodereactions">{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2aftermath/review.html|title=Half Life 2: Episode One for PC Review|accessdate=2006-09-02|year=2006|month=June}}</ref>

==PC game development==
{{main|Game development}}
Game development, as with [[console game]]s, is generally undertaken by one or more [[video game developer|game developer]]s using either standardised or proprietary tools. While games could previously be developed by very small groups of people, as in the early example of [[Wolfenstein 3D]], many popular computer games today require large development teams and budgets running into the millions of dollars.<ref name="devcosts">{{cite web| url =http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060405/wardell_01.shtml | title =Postmortem: Stardock's
Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords | accessdate =2006-09-13 | last =Wardell | first =Brad | date =2006-04-05}}</ref>

PC games are usually built around a central piece of software, known as a [[game engine]],<ref name="gameengine">{{cite web| url =http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,594,00.asp | title =Game Engine Anatomy 101, Part I   | accessdate =2006-09-22 | last =Simpson | first =Jake | Month =April| Year =2002}}</ref> that simplifies the development process and enables developers to easily port their projects between platforms. Unlike most consoles, which generally only run major engines such as [[Unreal Engine technology#Unreal Engine 3.0|Unreal Engine 3]] and [[RenderWare]] due to restrictions on [[homebrew]] software, personal computers may run games developed using a larger range of software. As such, a number of alternatives to expensive engines have become available, including [[open source]] solutions such as [[Crystal Space]], [[OGRE Engine|OGRE]] and [[DarkPlaces]].

===User-created modifications===
[[Image:Counter-Strike Box.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Counter-Strike]]'', a total-conversion mod for [[Valve Software]]'s ''[[Half-Life]]'', achieved great popularity online and was subsequently purchased by Valve.]]
{{main|Mod (computer gaming)}}
The multi-purpose nature of personal computers often allows users to modify the content of installed games with relative ease. Since console games are generally difficult to modify without a proprietary [[software development kit]], and are often protected by legal and physical barriers against tampering and [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew software]],<ref name="modlegality">{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/21/ps2_mod_chip_win/|title=Judge deems PS2 mod chips illegal in UK|accessdate=2006-09-22|year=2004|month=July}}</ref><ref name="modbarriers">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050910-5296.html|title=Xbox 360 designed to be unhackable|accessdate=2006-09-22|year=2005|month=October}}</ref> it is generally easier to modify the personal computer version of games using common, easy-to-obtain software. Users can then distribute their customised version of the game (commonly known as a ''mod'') by any means they choose.

The inclusion of map editors such as [[UnrealEd]] with the retail versions of many games, and others that have been made available online such as [[GtkRadiant]], allow users to create modifications for games easily, using tools that are maintained by the games' original developers. In addition, companies such as [[id Software]] have released the [[source code]] to older game engines, enabling the creation of entirely new games and major changes to existing ones.<ref name="q3source">{{cite news |title=Quake 3 Source Code Released |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/38305| date=August, 2005 | accessdate= 2006-10-22}}</ref>

Modding had allowed much of the community to produce game elements that would not normally be provided by the developer of the game, expanding or modifying normal gameplay to varying degrees. One notable example is the [[Hot Coffee mod]] for the PC port of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', which enables access to an abandoned sex minigame by simply modifying a [[bit]] of the game's data file.

==Distribution==
===Physical distribution===
Computer games are typically sold on standard storage media, such as [[compact disc]]s, [[DVD]], and [[floppy disk]]s.<ref>{{cite web|
url=http://www.iconocast.com/News_Files/BNews6_21_06/Biz1.htm|
title= The Next Billion Dollar Videogame  Opportunity|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> These were originally passed on to customers through [[mail order]] services,<ref name="mailorder">{{cite news |first=Dana |last=Lombardy |title=Inside the Industry |url=http://static.filefront.com/cgw/1984_0910_issue18.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[Computer Gaming World]] |page=6 | date=October, 1984 | accessdate= 2006-10-15}}</ref> although retail distribution has replaced it as the main distribution channel for video games due to higher sales.<ref name="retailsales">{{cite news |first=Dana |last=Lombardy |title=Inside the Industry |url=http://static.filefront.com/cgw/1982_0910_issue6.pdf |format=PDF |work=[[Computer Gaming World]] |page=2 | date=October, 1982 | accessdate= 2006-10-15}}</ref> Different formats of [[floppy disk]]s were initially the staple storage media of the 1980s and early 1990s, but have fallen out of practical use as the increasing sophistication of computer games raised the overall size of the game's data and program files.

The introduction of complex [[graphics engine]]s in recent times has resulted in additional storage requirements for modern games, and thus an increasing interest in [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s as the next compact storage media for personal computer games. The rising popularity of DVD drives in modern PCs, and the larger capacity of the new media (a single-layer DVD can hold up to 4.7 [[gigabyte]]s of data, more than five times as much as a single CD), have resulted in their adoption as a format for computer game distribution. To date, CD versions are still offered for most games, while some games offer both the CD and the DVD versions.

===Shareware===
{{main|Shareware|Game demo}}
Shareware marketing, whereby a limited or demonstration version of the full game is released to prospective buyers without charge, has been used as a method of distributing computer games since the early years of the gaming industry and was seen in the early days of [[Tanarus]] as well as many others. Shareware games generally offer only a small part of the gameplay offered in the retail product, and may be distributed with gaming magazines, in retail stores or on developers' websites free of charge.

In the early 1990s, shareware distribution was common among fledging game companies such as [[Apogee Software]], [[Epic Games|Epic Megagames]] and [[id Software]], and remains a popular distribution method among smaller game developers. However, shareware has largely fallen out of favor among established game companies in favour of traditional retail marketing, with notable exceptions such as [[Big Fish Games]] and [[PopCap Games]] continuing to use the model today.<ref>{{cite news|

[[Image:Steam3beta.PNG|thumb|250px|right|The [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]] content delivery system allows users to preload games prior to their release.]]

===Online delivery===
With the increased popularity of the [[Internet]], online distribution of game content has become more common.<ref>{{cite web|
url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/2005/09/22/news_6134035.html?sid=6134035 |
title=Spot On: The (new) dawn of digital distribution|date=June 18, 2003 |author=Brendan Sinclair|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> Retail services such as [[Direct2Drive]] and [[Download.com]] allow users to purchase and download large games that would otherwise only be distributed on physical media, such as [[DVD]]s, as well as providing cheap distribution of shareware and demonstration games. Other services, allow a subscription-based distribution model in which users pay a monthly to download and play as many games as they wish.

The [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]] system, developed by [[Valve Corporation]], provides an alternative to traditional online services. Instead of allowing the player to download a game and play it immediately, games are made available for "pre-load" in an encrypted form days or weeks before their actual release date. On the official release date, a relatively small component is made available to unlock the game. Steam also ensures that once bought, a game remains accessible to a customer for many years, while the traditional mediums of floppy disk and CD-ROM are susceptible to unrecoverable damage and misplacement.

==Computer game genres==
{{seealso|Computer and video game genres}}
<!--NOTE: List of game genres has been removed per suggestion on the talk page.-->
The [[real time strategy]] genre, which accounts for more than a quarter of all PC games sold,<ref name="ESApressrelease" /> has found very little success on video game consoles, with releases such as [[Starcraft 64]] failing in the marketplace. Strategy games tend to suffer from the design of console controllers, which do not allow fast, accurate movement.<ref name="nintendo">{{cite web | author = Joe Fielder| title = StarCraft 64| work = Gamespot.com |date = [[2000-05-12]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/n64/strategy/starcraft64/review.html?q=starcraft%2064| accessdate = 2006-08-19}}</ref> 

Conversely, [[Computer and video game genres#Action|action]] games have found considerable popularity on video game consoles, making up nearly a third of all console video games sold in 2004, compared to just four percent on the computer. Sports games have also found greater support on game consoles compared to personal computers.<ref name="ESApressrelease" />

</ol>]]{{main|Personal computer}}
===Hardware===
Modern computer games place great demand on the computer's hardware, often requiring a fast [[central processing unit]] (CPU) to function properly. CPU manufacturers historically relied mainly on increasing [[clock rate]]s to improve the performance of their processors, but had begun to move steadily towards [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] CPUs by [[2005 in video gaming|2005]]. These processors allow the computer to simultaneously process multiple tasks, called [[thread (computing)|thread]]s, allowing the use of more complex graphics, artificial intelligence and in-game physics.<ref name="multicore trend">{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2377&p=4|title=Xbox 360 designed to be unhackable|accessdate=2006-09-22|year=2005|month=October}}</ref><ref name="graphicstrend" />

Similarly, 3D games often rely on a powerful [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU), which accelerates the process of drawing complex scenes in realtime. GPUs may be an integrated part of the computer's [[motherboard]], the most common solution in laptops,<ref name="integrated gpus">{{cite web|url=http://hardware.earthweb.com/chips/article.php/3570161|title=Platform Trends: Mobile Graphics Heat Up|accessdate=2006-10-22|year=2005|month=December}}</ref> or come packaged with a discrete graphics card with a supply of dedicated [[Video RAM]], connected to the motherboard through either an [[accelerated graphics port|AGP]] or [[PCI-Express]] port. It is also possible to use multiple GPUs in a single computer, using technologies such as [[NVidia]]'s [[Scalable Link Interface]] and [[ATI]]'s [[ATI CrossFire|CrossFire]].

[[Sound card]]s are also available to provide improved audio in computer games. These cards provide improved [[3D audio effect|3D audio]] and provide audio enhancement that is generally not available with integrated alternatives, at the cost of marginally lower overall performance.<ref name="soundcard performance">{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/multimedia/showdoc.aspx?i=2518&p=10|title=X-Fi and the Elite Pro: SoundBlaster's Return to Greatness|accessdate=2006-10-22|year=2005|month=August}}</ref> The [[Creative Labs]] [[SoundBlaster]] line was for many years the ''de facto'' standard for sound cards, although its popularity dwindled as PC audio became a commodity on modern motherboards.

[[Physics processing unit]]s (PPUs), such as the [[AGEIA]] [[PhysX]] card, are also available to accelerate physics simulations in modern computer games. PPUs allow the computer to process more complex interactions among objects than is achievable using only the CPU, potentially allowing players a much greater degree of control over the world in games designed to use the card.<ref name="PPUs">{{cite web|url=http://hardware.earthweb.com/chips/article.php/3570161|title=Platform Trends: Mobile Graphics Heat Up|accessdate=2006-10-22|year=2005|month=December}}</ref>

Virtually all personal computers use a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[computer mouse|mouse]] for user input. Other common gaming peripherals are a headset for faster communication in online games, [[joystick]]s for [[flight simulator]]s, [[steering wheel]]s for driving games and [[gamepad]]s for console-style games.

===Software===
Computer games also rely on [[third-party]] software such as an [[Operating System|operating system (OS)]], [[device driver|device drivers]], [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and more to run. Today, the vast majority of computer games are designed to run on the [[Microsoft Windows]] OS. Whereas earlier games written for [[MS-DOS]] would include code to communicate directly with hardware, today [[API|abstract programming interfaces (APIs)]] provide an interface between the game and the OS, simplifying game design. Microsoft's [[DirectX]] is an API that is widely used by today's computer games to communicate with sound and graphics hardware. [[OpenGL]] is a [[cross-platform]] API for graphics rendering that is also used. The version of the graphics card's [[device driver|driver]] installed can often affect game performance and [[gameplay]]. It is not unusual for a game company to use a third-party [[game engine]], or third-party libraries for a game's [[game ai|AI]] or [[game physics|physics]].

===Multiplayer===
====Local area network gaming====
Multiplayer gaming was largely limited to [[local area network]]s (LANs) before cost-effective [[broadband Internet access]] became available, due to their typically higher [[bandwidth]] and lower [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] than the dial-up services of the time. These advantages allowed more players to join any given computer game, but have persisted today because of the higher latency of most Internet connections and the costs associated with broadband Internet.

LAN gaming typically requires two or more personal computers, a [[router]] and sufficient networking cables to connect every computer on the network. Additionally, each computer must have a [[network card]] installed or integrated onto its motherboard in order to communicate with other computers on the network. Optionally, any LAN may include an external connection to the Internet.

====Online games====
{{mainarticle|Online game}}
Online multiplayer games have achieved popularity largely as a result of increasing [[broadband internet|broadband]] adoption among consumers. Affordable high-bandwidth Internet connections allow large numbers of players to play together, and thus have found particular use in [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online RPGs]], [[Tanarus]] and persistent online games such as [[World War II Online]].

Although it is possible to participate in online computer games using dial-up [[modem]]s, broadband internet connections are generally considered necessary in order to reduce the latency between players (commonly known as "lag"). Such connections require a broadband-compatible modem connected to the personal computer through a [[network interface card]] (generally integrated onto the computer's [[motherboard]]), optionally separated by a [[router]]. Online games require a virtual environment, generally called a "game server." These virtual servers inter-connect gamers, allowing real time, and often fast paced action. To meet this subsequent need, [[Game server|Game Server Providers (GSP)]] have become increasingly more popular over the last half decade. While not required for all gamers, these servers provide a unique "home," fully customizable (such as additional modifications, settings, etc) - giving the end gamers the experience they desire. Today there are over 500,000 game servers hosted in North America alone. <ref>[http://www.steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats&cc=US Steam: Game and Player Statistics<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Emulation===
{{main|Emulator}}
Emulation software, used to run software without the original hardware, are popular for their ability to play legacy video games without the consoles or operating system for which they were designed. Console emulators such as [[NESticle]] and [[MAME]] are relatively commonplace, although the complexity of modern consoles such as the [[Xbox]] or [[Playstation]] makes them far more difficult to emulate, even for the original manufacturers.<ref name="xboxemulation">{{cite web| url = http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/xbox360_05.asp| title = Xbox 360 Review| accessdate = 2006-09-12| year = 2005| month = November}}</ref>

Most emulation software mimics a particular hardware architecture, often to an extremely high degree of accuracy. This is particularly the case with classic home computers such as the [[Commodore 64]], whose software often depends on highly sophisticated low-level programming tricks invented by game programmers and the [[demoscene]].

==Controversy==

{{main|Video game controversy}}
Computer games have long been a source of controversy, particularly related to the violence that has become commonly associated with video gaming in general. The debate surrounds the influence of objectionable content on the social development of [[minor]]s, with organisations such as the [[American Psychological Association]] concluding that video game violence increases children's aggression,<ref>{{cite web | author=[[American Psychological Association]] | url=http://www.psychologymatters.org/videogames.html | title= Violent Video Games - Psychologists Help Protect Children from Harmful Effects }}</ref> a concern that prompted a further investigation by the [[Center for Disease Control]] in September 2006.<ref name="cvgaggressionresearch">{{cite web| url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060918-7771.html

[[Game addiction|Video game addiction]] is another cultural aspect of gaming to draw criticism, as it can have a negative influence on health and on social relations and in the most extreme cases has led to death as a result of prolonged gameplay.<ref name="addictiondeaths">{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4137782.stm
