'''''Title TK''''' is the third album by the American band [[the Breeders]], released in May 2002. The group's second album, ''[[Last Splash]]'', came out in 1993. In the years following this, various band members left, and by sometime in 1997, singer and songwriter [[Kim Deal]] was the only regular member remaining. Throughout that year, Deal spent time in studios with numerous musicians and [[recording engineer|engineers]] to try to record a follow-up album. However, her reportedly demanding standards, drug use, and other difficult behavior alienated those she worked with.

In 1999, joined by her sister [[Kelley Deal|Kelley]], Deal began recording sessions with engineer [[Steve Albini]] in Chicago. She later decided that she needed a backing group, and by chance met members of the band [[Fear (band)|Fear]] at a bar in New York. Fear members Mando Lopez and Richard Presley, as well as Los Angeles musician [[Jose Medeles]], joined the Breeders' line-up with the Deal sisters. The group continued recording with Albini in 2001, and the output from these sessions was supplemented with two tracks recorded in Hollywood with engineers Andrew Alekel and Mark Arnold. Ten of the twelve songs on the album are credited solely to Kim Deal; the other two were written by all five band members.

The songs on ''Title TK'', which feature austere instrumentation and unpredictable musical flourishes, often possess a somber, intimate feel. Reviewers have commented on the unconventional and enigmatic, as well as dark but sometimes funny, character of the lyrics. Themes cited for the album include road trips and beer drinking. Harmonies between Kim and Kelly Deal are prominent throughout the songs, with Kim's vocals described as rough but endearing.

''Title TK'' generated three singles. It reached the top 100 in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Australia, and No. 130 in the United States. Critical appraisal of the album has mostly been positive.

==Background and initial recording attempts==
[[File:Kim Deal Smoke.jpg|thumb|right|Kim Deal's initial attempts to record the third Breeders' album were hampered in part by her drug use and bad relationships with recording personnel.<ref name=smith>{{harvnb|Smith|2002}}</ref>]]Between the formation of the Breeders in 1989 and the release of ''Title TK'' in 2002, the group underwent several personnel changes, with vocalist and songwriter [[Kim Deal]] the only constant member. Their debut album, 1990's ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'', included members [[Tanya Donelly]] and [[Britt Walford]], who later left, replaced by Kim's sister [[Kelley Deal]] and [[Jim Macpherson]] by the time of 1993's ''[[Last Splash]]''.<ref name=albini>{{harvnb|Albini|2002}}</ref><ref name=erlewine>{{harvnb|Erlewine}}</ref> Kelley Deal and original member [[Josephine Wiggs]] left in 1995, and Kim formed [[the Amps]] as a side project.<ref name=albini/><ref name=erlewine/> When she reformed the Breeders the following year, the group initially kept the Amps' line-up of Deal, Macpherson, Luis Lerma, and Nate Farley.<ref name=erlewine/> (Between 1989 and 1996, [[Carrie Bradley]] was also sometimes in the band.)<ref name=albini/><ref name=erlewine/>

Throughout 1997, Deal attempted to record tracks for a forthcoming album.<ref name=albini/> By this time, she had reportedly become difficult to work with, and had adopted very demanding musical standards for her bandmates.<ref name=smith/><ref name=klosterman>{{harvnb|Klosterman|2002|p=84}}</ref> At least two of the former Amps<U+2014>Macpherson and Farley<U+2014>quit in 1997 due to the unpleasant atmosphere of the recording sessions,<ref name=smith/><ref name=aston>{{harvnb|Aston|2013|p=556}}</ref> and were replaced by a series of other musicians throughout the year.<ref name=smith/><ref name=albini/> The 1997 sessions took place at four different New York studios, which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees for studio time, hotels, and moving musical equipment between locations.<ref name=smith/>

In addition to the various musicians who parted ways with Deal in 1997, multiple recording engineers also did the same, due to her difficult behavior and increased drug use.<ref name=smith/><ref name=aston/> The first engineer that she hired was Mark Freegard, who had helped to record ''Last Splash''.<ref name=smith/><ref name=aston/> Freegard reports that Deal was "totally lost" and that after seven weeks in the studio, there were no usable recordings.<ref name=aston/> Two subsequent engineers, [[John Agnello]] and [[Bryce Goggin]], had each worked with Deal in 1995 on parts of the Amps' ''[[Pacer (album)|Pacer]]'' release.<ref>{{harvnb|Pacer CD booklet}}</ref> Agnello quit the 1997 sessions after ongoing frustration, culminating when Deal disappeared for several days.<ref name=smith/> Goggin was put off by Deal's "futile&nbsp;... standards";<ref name=klosterman/> when she was unsatisfied with a drumming performance (by the percussionist of [[the Flaming Lips]]) that Goggin thought was outstanding, he told her to go home and master the drums herself.<ref name=smith/><ref name=klosterman/> Deal followed his advice, and went back to her hometown of [[Dayton, Ohio]], to practice the instrument.<ref name=smith/><ref name=klosterman/>

==Subsequent recording and coalescence of the group==
[[File:Albini-Shellac-7.jpg|thumb|right|Steve Albini was the main engineer for the ''Title TK'' sessions.]]Deal then spent "a lost year" in which she "[went] AWOL in New York".<ref name=aston/> She began recording again in 1999, first in Austin, Texas, and then at [[Electrical Audio]] studio in Chicago with [[Steve Albini]],<ref name=albini/> who she had previously worked with on ''Pod'',<ref>{{harvnb|Pod Credits}}</ref> ''Pacer'',<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|1996}}</ref> and [[Pixies|the Pixies]]' ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Surfer Rosa Credits}}</ref> Although Kim Deal performed most of the instrumental parts herself at these 1999 sessions, Kelley also had some involvement.<ref name=TitleTKliner/><ref name=albini/> They recorded "The She", "Forced to Drive", and "Too Alive" in Chicago; Deal's drum performance on the latter track was from the Texas session.<ref name=TitleTKliner/>

Deal liked the songs recorded so far, but realized she would not be able to tour without a band.<ref name=smith/> She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000.<ref name=smith/> By chance, she met members of the group [[Fear (band)|Fear]] at a bar<ref name=smith/><ref name=draper>{{harvnb|Draper|2002}}</ref><U+2014>drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando Lopez, and guitarist Richard Presley<ref name=albini/><U+2014>and invited them to [[jam session|jam]] with her at the studio she was renting.<ref name=klosterman/><ref name=Kot>{{harvnb|Kot|2001}}</ref> Deal decided that she wanted to continue playing with these musicians,<ref name=klosterman/> and within three months, moved to Los Angeles, where Fear was based.<ref name=smith/><ref>{{harvnb|Breeders Bounce Back With 'Title TK'}}</ref> Soon after, Kelley also joined the new Breeders line-up.<ref name=klosterman/> For much of the rest of the year, the ensemble practiced and wrote songs.<ref name=albini/> Jaimez was involved in other musical projects, and decided that he did not have enough time for the Breeders;<ref name=albini/> he was replaced by Los Angeles drummer [[Jose Medeles]].<ref name=albini/>

The five Breeders returned to Chicago in mid-2001 to continue recording with Albini.<ref name=Kot/> "Little Fury", "London Song", "Off You", "Put on a Side", "Full on Idle", "T and T", and "Huffer" were recorded during the 2001 session.<ref name=TitleTKliner/> At some point in 2000 to 2002, the group also spent time at the Grandmaster Recording Ltd. studio in Hollywood, resulting in "Son of Three" and "Sinister Foxx"; the engineers at this session were Mark Arnold and Andrew Alekel.<ref name=TitleTKliner/> Kelley has stated that "Little Fury" and "Sinister Foxx" started as "just ideas" by her and Kim that turned into full collaborations by the group<ref name=draper/><U+2014>all five musicians received songwriting credits on these tracks.<ref name=TitleTKliner/> Kim Deal is credited as sole songwriter on the remaining ten tracks,<ref name=TitleTKliner/> although other band members contributed musical ideas as well.<ref name=draper/> Another song from the ''Title TK'' sessions, "Fire the Maid", written by Kelley,<ref name=draper/> was performed in concert in 2000 and 2001,<ref>{{harvnb|Freek|2000}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Klein|2001}}</ref> but was not included on the album.<ref name=draper/>

While recording ''Title TK'', Kim Deal adopted a philosophy she calls "[[All Wave]]".<ref name=albini/> This approach stipulates that only analog recording processes, and no computer manipulation, may be used.<ref name=albini/> Deal has said that she likes "interesting mistakes" in song production, and that her beliefs about recording are "a reaction&nbsp;... to everything sounding so straight and clean in most records today".<ref name=Kot/> The album's [[audio mastering|mastering]] was also done using analog processes, by Albini and Steve Rook, at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref name=TitleTKliner/>

==Music and lyrics==
[[File:Breeders Kim Deal.jpg|thumb|left|Mando Lopez and Kim Deal (shown here in concert in 2004) and the other Breeders delivered restrained, expressive performances during the ''Title TK'' sessions.<ref name=robinson>{{harvnb|Robinson|2002}}</ref><ref name=moores>{{harvnb|Moores|2013}}</ref>]]The sound of ''Title TK'' has been described as "skeletal",<ref name=robinson/><ref name=Christgau>{{harvnb|Christgau}}</ref> "minimalist",<ref name=moores/><ref name=Willis>{{harvnb|Willis|2002}}</ref> and "stripped down",<ref name=Phares/><ref name=klosterman/> with the band using restrained instrumentation for expressive effect.<ref name=robinson/><ref name=moores/> Throughout the album, one-off and unexpected musical ideas are common: "keyboards buzz from out of nowhere, guitars hit bum notes intentionally, basslines amble up and down the scale, sometimes two at a time";<ref name=Bryant>{{harvnb|Bryant|2002}}</ref> on the track "Put on a Side": "At 1.28 there is a distorted chug. At 2.29 a drum-roll. Neither of these introduces anything, continues or reappears. They just pop up and then evaporate like accidental fireworks."<ref name=moores/> The songs, which are "sad"<ref name=robinson/><ref name=moores/><ref name=berger>{{harvnb|Berger|2002}}</ref> and "intimate",<ref name=Phares/><ref name=moores/><ref name=clarke>{{harvnb|Clarke, Betty 2002}}</ref> have a relaxed and unpolished character.<ref name=Willis/><ref name=Bryant/> Music writers have noted on one hand the divergence in speed and levity from song to song,<ref name=Phares/><ref name=klosterman/><ref name=draper/> and on the other, the unified feel of the album as a whole.<ref name=robinson/><ref name=miaclarke>{{harvnb|Clarke, Mia 2002}}</ref>

{{Listen|filename=Breeders_Off_You.ogg|title="Off You"|description=The songs on ''Title TK'', including "Off You", feature "minimalist" instrumentation,<ref name=moores/><ref name=Willis/> and one-off, unexpected musical embellishments, such as the "bizarre solitary synthesiser splodge" heard here.<ref name=moores/> Reviewers have commented on the "intimate"<ref name=Phares/><ref name=moores/><ref name=clarke/> and "sad"<ref name=robinson/><ref name=moores/><ref name=berger/> feel of the album and the "weary" quality of Kim Deal's singing.<ref name=Bryant/><ref name=berger/><ref name=cibula/>}}

Reviewers have also commented on the unorthodox character of the words and lyrical structures on ''Title TK''. These "cut-up"<ref name=moores/> and "sweetly sinister lullaby"<ref name=miaclarke/> lyrics are "full of sugary syllables and unfinished sentences".<ref name=clarke/> The overall effect of the lyrics has been described as "poetry"<U+2014>such as the lines "If I find the door / I am the son of Go" in "Son of Three"<ref name=cibula>{{harvnb|Cibula|2002}}</ref> and "Round up holler girl / Ah I will sing / Title TK / If I don't black out / Dumb made for fucking / And missing from the party / That boy spun out" in "Little Fury"<ref name=moores/><U+2014>but also as "cryptic"<ref name=Phares/> and as "imagistic baffle".<ref name=Christgau/> While some critics have highlighted dark themes in the lyrics,<ref name=clarke/><ref name=miaclarke/><ref name=Abbott>{{harvnb|Abbott|2002}}</ref> others have commented on the humor on the album.<ref name=Willis/><ref name=berger/> Themes reviewers have heard in the songs include road trips,<ref name=clarke/><ref name=miaclarke/> absence,<ref name=moores/> and beer drinking.<ref name=Christgau/><ref name=Abbott/>

The singing on the album includes prominent harmonies between the Deal sisters.<ref name=smith/><ref name=draper/><ref name=Willis/> These harmonies interweave their very similar voices,<ref name=Phares/> and create a "bittersweet"<ref name=draper/> and "haunting" effect.<ref name=Willis/> Kim Deal's singing on ''Title TK'' has been called "rasp[y]",<ref name=Bryant/> "weary",<ref name=Bryant/><ref name=berger/><ref name=cibula/> and "more sandpaper than sugar".<ref name=Phares/> Reviewers have also heard a "hopeful",<ref name=berger/><ref name=cibula/> "sweet",<ref name=berger/> and "melting"<ref name=miaclarke/> quality to her voice. Her vocal delivery on "Off You" has been described as "heartbreaking"<ref name=Willis/><ref name=berger/> and "fragile".<ref name=moores/>

Critics have mostly responded positively to the album. Betty Clarke of ''[[The Guardian]]'' singles out the "separation of sounds" on tracks such as "T and T" and "Off You" as the best aspect of the album, and writes that ''Title TK'' is "a welcome return to punky pop that knows how to flex some melodic muscle".<ref name=clarke/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Arion Berger, while emphasizing the pain and melancholy present in the songs, praises the record as "absolutely beautiful".<ref name=berger/> ''[[NME]]'' reviewer John Robinson hears the album as "tuneful&nbsp;... and impressively empty sounding, the arrangements of the tunes showcasing skeletal guitar and drum patterns and Deal's remarkable voice".<ref name=robinson/> Matt Cibula of [[PopMatters]] "really like[s]" ''Title TK'', and opines that it sounds "buzzy and funny and swaggering in that special Albini uber-geek sort of way".<ref name=cibula/> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' critic Brian Garrity comments that ''Title TK'' "retains the offbeat charm that has always been at the center of the band's appeal".<ref name=Garrity/> More negatively, Melanie McFarland of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' asserts that the Breeders "haven't solidified [their magic] with ''Title TK''" and that "all Breeders albums have mood swings, but this one has too many".<ref name=McFarland/>
''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's Steve Kandell characterizes the album as "a little unsure of itself", and points to the Breeders' re-recording of ''[[Pacer (album)|Pacer]]''{{'}}s "Full on Idle" as evidence that "the creative coffers weren't exactly spilling over" for Deal.<ref name=Kendell/>
