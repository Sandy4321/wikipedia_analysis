'''Lorrin Andrews Thurston''' ([[1857]]<U+2013>[[1931]]), was a lawyer born and raised in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] who published the ''Pacific Commercial Advertiser'' (forerunner of the present-day ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]''). The child of missionaries to Hawai{{okina}}i, Thurston played a prominent role in the revolution that transformed Hawai{{okina}}i from a monarchy into a sovereign constitutional republic.

As Interior Minister of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i, Thurston authored the [[Bayonet Constitution]] of 1887 that effectively stripped the monarch [[King Kal<U+0101>kaua]] of all executive power and gave American and European immigrants the right to vote. Later, he led the self-titled [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] that overthrew [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] in [[1893]].  Alleged involvement of the [[United States Marine Corps]] in the matter was apologized for a century later by the [[U.S. Congress]] in the controversial [[Apology Resolution]] of 1993. Thurston was involved with the drafting of the constitution for the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|Provisional Government of Hawai{{okina}}i]] and headed the commission sent to [[Washington, DC]] to negotiate American annexation. He helped draft the constitution of the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]], and after annexation, retired to private life. As principal owner and editor of the ''Advertiser'', he was a promoter of the tourist and pineapple industries. His fortunes rose considerably as a result of the Islands' annexation by the United States.

Thurston is credited with developing Hawai{{okina}}i's sugar cane plantations and railroads and bringing the first electric street cars to [[Honolulu]]. He was also a volcano enthusiast, building the Volcano House (today a hotel at the rim of [[Kilauea|K&#299;lauea]] volcano's summit caldera) and bringing officials and delegations from the United States to see the volcano. He was friends with [[Thomas Jaggar]] and supported the [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] during its early years. The Thurston [[lava tube]] in [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]] is named after him.

Thurston's daughter Margaret was the mother of [[Thurston Twigg-Smith]].
