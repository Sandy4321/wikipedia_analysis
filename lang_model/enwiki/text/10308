'''Caf<U+00E9> Kranzler''' is a famous caf<U+00E9> on [[Kurf<U+00FC>rstendamm]] in the [[Charlottenburg]] district of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

Today not much is left of the original Caf<U+00E9> Kranzler opened in 1834 by [[Archduchy of Austria|Austrian]]-born confectionist Johann Georg Kranzler (1795<U+2013>1866) on [[Unter den Linden]] No. 25 at the corner of [[Friedrichstra<U+00DF>e]] in the present-day [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] district. Including a sun terrace, an ice-cream parlour and a smokers' room, it swiftly gained the reputation of being one of the city's finest caf<U+00E9>s. In 1932 a branch was opened in Charlottenburg in the rooms of the former ''Caf<U+00E9> des Westens'' on Kurf<U+00FC>rstendamm.

In 1944 the parent house in Mitte was completely destroyed during the [[Battle of Berlin (air)|Battle of Berlin]], today it is the site of the [[Westin Hotels|Westin]] Grand Hotel. However after the war the Charlottenburg branch in then [[West Berlin]] went on to become a major tourist attraction in its own right, the current flat-roofed building was erected in 1958. Nevertheless the Caf<U+00E9> Kranzler has fallen victim to the massive redevelopment programme which has been changing the face of Berlin since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989. In 2000 it reopened as a small bar in the rotunda on the second floor, built-in the ''Neues Kranzler Eck'' shopping centre designed by [[Helmut Jahn]].
