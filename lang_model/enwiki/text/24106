The '''BFW M.20''' (also known as the '''Messerschmitt M 20''' after the designer's surname) was a [[Germany|German]] single-engine, high-wing [[monoplane]] 10-seat [[Airliner|passenger transport aircraft]], developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] used it throughout the 1930s on a variety of routes.

==Design and development==
The M 20<ref name= "JRS"/> was designed by [[Willy Messerschmitt]] at [[Bayerische Flugzeugwerke]], primarily for use with Luft Hansa which had ordered two in advance of the first flight. It was a development of the [[Messerschmitt M 18|BFW M.18d]] eight-seater equipped with a single 375&nbsp;kW (500&nbsp;hp) upright [[Inline engine (aviation)|inline]] water-cooled [[BMW VI]]a engine. It had a high, [[Cantilever#In aircraft|cantilever]] wing based around a robust D-section box formed from a single [[Duralumin|dural]] [[Spar (aviation)|spar]] and dural skin forward to the [[leading edge]]. The [[fuselage]] was all-metal, with a mostly dural frame covered with metal sheeting<ref name="Flt28"/> providing rectangular cross-section accommodation, with four square windows a side, for eight passengers. The single-axle main [[undercarriage]] was strutted vertically to the wing.

The aircraft made its maiden flight on 26 February 1928 but was lost when pilot Hans Hackmack bailed out at low altitude and was killed after the surface stripped from part of the wing. A second M.20 was flown on 3 August 1928, and became the first of two M.20a series to fly with Luft Hansa.

Encouraged by their performance, Luft Hansa ordered 12 more, enlarged, M.20b aircraft. These carried 10 passengers in a fuselage with five windows a side. It had [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] on the wing and a more rounded [[vertical stabilizer|vertical tail]].

==Operational history==
The Luft Hansa M.20s<ref name="JRS"/> entered service in 1929 on routes that went from [[Switzerland]] via Germany to the [[Netherlands]] and from Stuttgart via [[Marseille]] to [[Barcelona]]. From the mid-1930s, they were operating German internal and holiday routes. Two were still flying such routes in 1942.

One former Luft Hansa airframe went to Brazil with [[Varig]] in 1937.<ref name="JRS"/><ref>http://www.goldenyears.ukf.net/reg_D-8.htm</ref> It crashed in 1948,<ref>http://www.goldenyears.ukf.net/reg_PP-.htm</ref> the only M 20 to survive the war.

===The Messerschmitt-Milch relationship===
Hans Hackmack, who died in the first flight of the M 20, was a close friend of [[Erhard Milch]], the head of Luft Hansa and the German civil aviation authorities. Milch was upset by the lack of response from Messerschmitt and this led to a lifelong hatred towards him. Milch eventually cancelled all contracts with Messerschmitt and forced BFW into bankruptcy in 1931. However, the German re-armament programs and Messerschmitt's friendship with [[Hugo Junkers]] prevented a stagnation of the careers of him and BFW, which was started again in 1933. Milch still prevented Messerschmitt's takeover of the BFW until 1938, hence the designation "Bf" of early Messerschmitt designs.{{cn|date=January 2013}}
