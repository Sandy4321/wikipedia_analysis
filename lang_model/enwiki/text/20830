'''''Paradise''''' is the third [[extended play]] (EP) by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Lana Del Rey]], following ''[[Kill Kill]]'' (2008) and ''[[Lana Del Rey (EP)|Lana Del Rey]]'' (2011). Slated to be released on November 12, 2012, through [[Universal Music]], it was produced by [[Rick Nowels]], Justin Parker, and [[Rick Rubin]]. The nine tracks will be available in [[Music download|digital download format]], [[Compact Disc|audio CD]], and [[Vinyl record|vinyl]], as a standalone EP and as part of a two-disc box set for a reissuing of Del Rey's sophomoric album ''[[Born to Die (Lana Del Rey album)|Born to Die]]''.

The EP's [[lead single]] is "[[Ride (Lana Del Rey song)|Ride]]", a [[downtempo]] [[pop ballad]] produced by Rick Rubin and co-written by "[[Video Games (song)|Video Games]]" author [[Justin Parker]]. The video for "Ride" premiered at a promotional event in Santa Monica on October 10, airing online two days later. Critics condemned the video for containing [[antifeminism]] themes and [[prostitution]] advocacy. 

A [[Cover version|cover]] of the [[1950s#Music|popular 1950s track]], "[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]", and an original track, "Burning Desire", were included on the EP as [[promotional single]]s. An ancillary [[music video]] for "Blue Velvet" was used in a commercial for clothing line [[H&M]] to help promote the EP. For the [[2012 Paris Motor Show]], Del Rey served as a model for the [[Jaguar F-Type]] [[luxury automobile]] and performed "Burning Desire" as another avenue of promotion. "Burning Desire" also serves as the [[soundtrack]] for an [[eponymous]]ly titled [[short film]] starring [[Damian Lewis]] scheduled for a 2013 release. A teaser trailer was released to Del Rey's official [[YouTube]] channel with snippets of each song featured on the EP. Even before its release, the song "Cola" received media attention due to the controversial nature of its [[lyrics]]. The track was confirmed to be the EP's second single several days after its release.

In an interview with ''[[RTVE]]'' on June 15, 2012, Del Rey announced she has been working on a new album due in November, and that five tracks have already been written, two of them being "Will You Still Love Me When I'm No Longer Young and Beautiful" and "In the Land of Gods and Monsters" and the other track titled "I Sing the Body Electric", which was performed and announced as one of her songs at the BBC Radio1's Hackney Weekend. In an interview with Tim Blackwell for Nova FM in Melbourne, Australia, Del Rey added that her upcoming November release would not be a new album, but more like an EP, which she described as the Paradise Edition of ''Born to Die''. Del Rey stated that the new release would have around seven new songs.<ref name="RTVE">{{cite web |url=http://www.rtve.es/radio/20120615/lana-del-rey-electrica-amon-tobin-calentando-motores-para-su-espectacular-show-sonar/536599.shtml |title=Lana del Rey, el<U+00E9>ctrica y Amon Tobin calentando motores para su espectacular show en S<U+00F3>nar|publisher=[[RTVE]]|language=[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|date=June 15, 2012 |accessdate=June 19, 2012}}</ref>

In general, the EP received mixed reviews. The singles and promotional singles were congratulated, while the album as a whole was criticized. Gil Kaufman of [[MTV]] wrote that "[the reissue] is as mellow and languorous... as she was on her debut." On the snippet video, he said, "...the new songs gives a peek at the gangster Nancy Sinatra's ongoing fascination with a sleepy, seductive sound and lyrics that mix old-fashion girl group obsession with sometimes profane, shocking new-school swagger."<ref name=mtvparadise/> ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]'' said the song titles were predictably pokerfaced.<ref name=stuff/> "Ride" received widely positive reviews, with the only qualms circling around the unrealistic cover art and coy song title. Of the cover art, Jessica Sager of PopCrush said it's unclear how the tire swing is suspended, with no visible trees nearby. Sager highlighted rumors circulating the internet about the [[music video]] for the single being recorded in [[Valley of Fire]] in [[Clark County, Nevada]].<ref>{{cite web|fist=Jessica|last=Sager|title=Three New Lana Del Rey Tracks Leak as <U+2018>Ride<U+2019> Single Art Hits the Web|url=http://popcrush.com/lana-del-rey-three-tracks-ride-single-art/|work=PopCrush|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref> [[Contactmusic.com]] noticed the track adheres to Del Rey's trademark sound, stating that the notion of her even having a trademark after one commercially successful album indicates that "we haven't seen the last of her just yet". Of the production itself, it was said that "Ride" is more accomplished than Del Rey's previous endeavors, with the strengths of the track outshining the flaws.

John Bush, the Allmusic reviewer, canned the lyrical content of ''Paradise''. For example, he highlighted the lyrics of "Body Electric", which state: "[[Elvis]] is my daddy/ [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]]'s my mother/ [[Jesus]] is my bestest friend/ We get crazy every Friday night/ [[Drop It Like It's Hot|drop it like it's hot]] in the pale moonlight.", as being "[[cliche]]" and "babyish", a trend pervading the entire album.<ref name=allreview/> On a positive note, Bush proposed that "Blue Velvet" proved Del Rey was more than capable of performing vocally when given tasteful content.<ref name=allreview/> Wrapping up the review, Bush concluded that, overall, Del Rey has lyrically remained in a stasis, with the album serving as fodder for her hype and image. According to Bush, Del Rey embodied the album with a [[simile]] from Gods & Monsters: "Like a groupie incognito posing as a real singer, [[Life imitating art|life imitates art]]."<ref name=allreview/> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the EP "surprisingly strong".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Mikael|title=Perspective: Christina Aguilera, Lana Del Rey play with personas|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-1113-aguilera-del-rey-20121113,0,89437.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref> ''[[Digital Spy]]'' said: 

{{Cquote|Current single "Ride" finds her wearing The Boss's influence on her sleeve most plainly with its galloping verses and sweeping melody, albeit delivered with Lana's '50s-styled Hollywood demeanour.{{sic}} Elsewhere, there's more talk of bad boys, cherry pie and other old fashioned glamourisms{{sic}} much like its parent album, but there's still progression to be found. The multiple hooks in "Cola" feel polished without compromising her rebellious nature (she opens it with the line: "My p***y tastes like Pepsi-Cola"), while the booming "Body Electric" sees her revisiting her Marilyn Monroe persona with more believable results than previous attempts. She treads close to being kooky for the sake of kooky on "Yayo", but when she gets it right in the case of "Bel Air" - a snowy, [[Tim Burton]]-inspired ballad - Lana proves there's plenty more to be excited for on album two.<ref name=digireview/>}}

Pointing out the weaknesses of "Blue Velvet" and "Yayo", [[LGBT]] lifestyle magazine ''[[So So Gay]]'' thought this about ''Paradise'' as a whole: "The existing themes, stunning musicality, and lyrical strength of the original are complimented by a series of new tracks that give the listener 'more of the same'."<ref name=sosogay>{{cite web|last=B|first=Jon|title=Album Review: Lana Del Rey - Born to Die (The Paradise Edition)|url=http://sosogay.co.uk/music-review/album-review-lana-del-rey-born-to-die-the-paradise-edition/|work=[[So So Gay]]|publisher=So So Gay Ltd.|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>
