{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Mahavatar Babaji''' ([[IAST]]: Mah<U+0101>vat<U+0101>r B<U+0101>b<U+0101>j<U+012B>) is the name given to an Indian [[saint]] by [[Lahiri Mahasaya|Shy<U+0101>macharan Lahir<U+012B>]] and several of his disciples<ref>[[Yukteswar Giri]], Ram Muzumdar, Kebalananda, and Pranabananda Giri</ref> who met Mahavatar Babaji between 1861 and 1935. Some of these meetings were described by [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] in his book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'', including a first hand telling of Yogananda's own meeting with Mahavatar Babaji.<ref name=yogananda>Yogananda, Paramahansa, ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 2005.

Mahavatar Babaji's given name is unknown, so those who met him during that period all called him by the title first given to him by Lahir<U+012B>.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/> "Mahavatar" means "great avatar", and "Babaji" simply means "revered father". Some of the encounters included two or more witnesses<U+2014>discussions between those who met Mahavatar Babaji indicate that they all met the same person.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=pranabananda/><ref name=yukteswarbio/>

==Childhood==

There are very few accounts of Babaji's childhood, one source of information is the book ''Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga tradition'' by [[Marshall Govindan]].<ref name="Govindan2001">{{cite book

Ramaiah founded on 17 October 1952, (they claim <U+2013> at the request of Babaji) a new organisation, "Kriya Babaji Sangah," dedicated to the teaching of Babaji's Kriya Yoga. They claim that in 1953 Mahavatar Babaji told them that he had been born on 30 November 203 CE in a small coastal village now known as Parangipettai, in Tamil Nadu, India.<ref name="NeelakantanRamaiah2006">{{cite book

In the writings of Paramahansa Yogananda in his ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', many references were made to Mahavatar Babaji including from Lahir<U+012B> and Yukteshwar.<ref name=yogananda/> 
In his book ''The Second Coming of Christ'', Yogananda states that Jesus Christ went to India and conferred with Mahavatar Babaji. This would make Babaji at least 2000 years old.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |authorlink= |title=The Second Coming of Christ: The Resurrection of the Christ Within You p. |year=2004 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-87612-555-0}}</ref>
According to Govindan's book, Babaji Nagaraj's father was the priest of the village's temple. Babaji revealed only those details which he believed to be formative as well as potentially instructive to his disciples. Govindan mentioned one incident like this: "One time Nagaraj's mother had got one rare [[jackfruit]] for a family feast and put it aside. Babaji was only 4 years old at that time. He found the jackfruit when his mother was not around and ate it all. When his mother came to know about it, she flew in blind rage and stuffed a cloth inside Babaji's mouth, nearly suffocating him, but he survived. Later on he thanked God for showing him that she was to be loved without attachment or illusion. His Love for his mother became unconditional and detached."<ref name="Govindan2001"/>

When Nagaraj was about 5 years old, someone kidnapped him and sold him as a slave at Calcutta (Now [[Kolkata]]). His new owner however was a kind man and he freed Nagaraj shortly thereafter. Nagaraj then joined a small group of wandering [[Sannyasa|sanny<U+0101>sin]] due to their radiant faces and love for God. During the next few years, he wandered from place to place, studying holy scriptures like the [[Vedas]], [[Upanishad]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], [[Bhagavad Gita]].

==Quest for self realisation==
According to Marshall Govindan's book, at the age of eleven, he made a difficult journey by foot and boat with a group of ascetics to [[Kataragama]], Sri Lanka. Nagaraj met Siddha [[Bhogarnathar]] and became his disciple. Nagaraj performed intensive yogic [[sadhana]] for a long time with him. Bhogarnather inspired Nagaraj to seek his initiation into Kriya Kundalini Pranayam from Siddha [[Agastya]]. Babaji became a disciple of Siddha Agastya. Nagaraj was initiated into the secrets of Kriya Kundalini Pranayama or "Vasi Yogam". Babaji made a long pilgrimage to [[Badrinath]] and spent eighteen months practising yogic [[kriya]] taught to him by Siddha Agastya and Bhogarnathar. Babaji attained self-realization shortly thereafter.<ref name="Govindan2001"/>

They (who?) also claim that these revelations were made by Babaji himself to S.A.A. Ramaiah, a young graduate student in geology at the University of Madras and V.T. Neelakantan, a famous journalist, and close student of Annie Besant, President of the Theosophical Society and mentor of Krishnamurti. Babaji was said to have appeared to each of them independently and then brought them together to work for his Mission in 1942.<ref>{{cite web |title=Babaji's Kriya Yoga |url=http://www.babajiskriyayoga.net/english/about-babaji.htm}}</ref>

==Reports of meetings, 1861<U+2013>1966==

===Shy<U+0101>macharan Lahir<U+012B>===
{{Main|Lahiri Mahasaya}}
The first reported encounter with Mahavatar Babaji was in 1861, when Shy<U+0101>macharan Lahir<U+012B> (called "Mah<U+0101>saya" by disciples, devotees, and admirers) was posted to [[Ranikhet]] in his work as an accountant for the British government. One day while walking in the hills of [[Dunagiri]] above Ranikhet, he heard a voice calling his name. Following the voice up the mountain, he met a "tall, divinely radiant [[sadhu]]."<ref name=lahiribio/> He was amazed to find that the sadhu knew his name.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/> This sadhu was Mahavatar Babaji.

Mahavatar Babaji told Lahir<U+012B> that he was his guru from the past, then initiated him into [[Kriya Yoga]] and instructed Lahiri to initiate others. Lahiri wanted to remain with Mahavatar Babaji, who told him instead that he must return to the world to teach Kriya Yoga and that "Kriya Yoga [[sadhana]] would spread through the people of the world through his (Lahiri's) presence in the world."<ref name=lahiribio/>

Lahir<U+012B> reported that Mahavatar Babaji did not give his name or background, so Lahiri gave him the title "Mahavatar Babaji." Many sadhus in India are called Babaji, and sometimes even "Babaji Maharaj", which has caused confusion between Mahavatar Babaji and other sadhus with similar names.<ref name=lahiribio/>

Lahir<U+012B> had many meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, recounted in several books, including Paramhansa Yogananda's ''Autobiography of a Yogi'',<ref name=yogananda/> ''Yogiraj Shyama Charan Lahiri Mahasaya'' (Lahiri's biography),<ref name=lahiribio/> and ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri'',<ref name=purana>Chatterjee, Ashoke Kumar, ''Purana Purusha: Yogiraj Sri Shama Churn Lahiri''. Yogiraj Publications, 2004. ISBN 81-87563-01-X.</ref> among others.

The references of Sri Lahiri mahasaya in Sampoorna Sripada Vallabha Charitam, as the guru of Sri Shirdi Saibaba and initiating him to kriya yoga.

===Disciples of Shy<U+0101>macharan Lahir<U+012B>===

Several disciples of Shy<U+0101>macharan Lahir<U+012B> also said that they had met Babaji. Through discussion with each other, and the fact that some of these encounters included two or more witnesses, they confirmed that the person they saw was the same sadhu that Lahir<U+012B> called Mahavatar Babaji.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/><ref name=kebalanandabio>{{cite book |last=Giri |first=Satyananda |title=Yogacharya Shastri Mahasaya: a short biographical sketch of Hamsaswami Kebalanandaji Maharaj |publisher=Yoganiketan |year=2004}}</ref>

In 1894, at the [[Kumbha Mela]] in Allahabad, [[Yukteswar Giri]], a disciple of Lahir<U+012B>, met Mahavatar Babaji. He was surprised by the striking resemblance between Lahir<U+012B> and Mahavatar Babaji.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=yukteswarbio/> Others who met Babaji also commented on the resemblance.<ref name=lahiribio/> It was at this meeting that Mahavatar Babaji instructed Sri Yukteswar to write the book that was to become ''Kaivalya Darshanam'', or ''The Holy Science''.<ref name=yukteswar/> Yukteswar had two more meetings with Mahavatar Babaji, including one in the presence of Lahiri Mahasaya.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=yukteswarbio/><ref name=lahiribio/>

Pranabananda Giri, another disciple of Lahir<U+012B>, also met Mahavatar Babaji in the presence of Lahir<U+012B>, at Lahir<U+012B>'s home. Pranavananda asked Mahavatar Babaji his age. Mahavatar Babaji responded that he was about 500 years old at that time.<ref name=pranabananda/>

Keshabananda, a disciple of Lahir<U+012B>, tells of meeting Mahavatar Babaji in the mountains near [[Badrinath]] around 1935, after he became lost wandering in the mountains.<ref name=yogananda/> At that meeting, Pranabananda reported that Babaji gave him a message for Paramahansa Yogananda, that "I won't see him this time, as he is eagerly hoping; but I shall see him on some other occasion."<ref name=yogananda/> In his book ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', Paramahansa Yogananda wrote that Mahavatar Babaji visited him before his journey to America and addressed him saying, "You are the one I have chosen to spread the message of Kriya Yoga in the West."<ref name=yogananda/>

Other disciples of Lahir<U+012B> who reported meetings with Mahavatar Babaji include Kebalananda Giri<ref name=kebalanandabio/> and Ram Gopal Muzumdar, who recounted meeting Mahavatar Babaji and his sister, whom he called Mataji.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/> In addition, a disciple of [[Trailanga Swami]], Shankari Mata (also called Shankari Mai [[-ji|Jiew]]) met Mahavatar Babaji while visiting Lahiri Mahasaya.<ref name=yogananda/><ref name=lahiribio/>

==Traditional legends==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Puja to Babaji Mahavatar.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Puja is being conducted to the idol of Babaji Mahavatar]] -->
Legendary powers and age have been attributed to Mahavatar Babaji by the disciples of Lahir<U+012B>. These stories have led many to believe that Mahavatar Babaji is a legendary person, rather than a real sadhu that was seen by numerous witnesses from 1861 to 1935.

Paramahansa Yogananda, in his Autobiography, described Mahavatar Babaji's role on earth:
<blockquote>The Mahavatar is in constant communion with Christ; together they send out vibrations of redemption, and have planned the spiritual technique of salvation for this age. The work of these two {{Sic|?|hide=y|fully|-}}illumined masters<U+2013>one with the body, and one without it<U+2013>is to inspire the nations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds, religious sectarianism, and the boomerang-evils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the trend of modern times, especially of the influence and complexities of Western civilization, and realizes the necessity of spreading the self-liberations of yoga equally in the West and in the East.</blockquote>

In addition, Babaji is reputed to be ageless, according to some accounts, and about 500 years old around the late 1800s, according to Pranabananda.<ref name=pranabananda/> Yogananda reports that, according to the disciples of Lahir<U+012B>, nobody knows Babaji's age, family, place of birth, true name, or other details "dear to the annalist's heart."<ref name=yogananda/>

According to Yogananda's autobiography, he has a sister called Mataji (meaning "Holy Mother") who also has lived throughout the centuries. Her level of spiritual attainment is comparable to her brother's, and she lives in a state of spiritual ecstasy in an underground cave. Although only three pages in the book are dedicated to her, she is described by Ram Gopal as "young and surpassingly lovely" as well as a "glorious woman."<ref name=yogananda>Yogananda, Paramahansa, ''Autobiography of a Yogi'', 2005. Chapter 33 ISBN 978-1-56589-212-5.</ref> 

Yogananda frequently prayed out loud to "Babaji-Krishna."<ref>Yogananda, Paramahansa: various articles (''Praecepta Lessons'', Volume 1, 1934) and recordings (''One Life Versus Reincarnation'' [CD]. ISBN 0-87612-439-2).</ref>

==Visiting Mahavatar Babaji's cave at Kukuchina==

Kukuchina (locals spell it out as Kukurchina) is a hamlet which is around 20 kms from Dwarahat. At the 15th km from Dwarahat on the way to Kukuchina is the Dunagiri Mandir. Kukuchina is the most nearest point which could be reached through road and to start the trek to Babaji's cave. If travelling from Delhi, the easiest way is to board the Ranikhet Express, which leaves Old Delhi railway station at 2230 hrs for Kathgodam. It is better to get down at Haldwani, the station prior to Kathgodam, because it is from Haldwani bus-stand buses leave for Dwarahat or Ranikhet. It is understood that there is one State owned roadways bus which leaves for Kukuchina directly from Haldwani, at 0730 hrs. However, it reaches Kukuchina in the late evening and after halting for the night at Kukuchina itself, it leaves Kukuchina for Haldwani the next day early morning at 0630 hrs and reaches Haldwani around 1400 hrs. The one way fare from Haldwani to Kukuchina is around Rs.230/- (as on May 2015). Alternately, if countinous journey is not preferred, one can reach Ranikhet from Haldwani, which takes approximately 6 hours and then from Ranikhet to Dwarahat which may take another 90 minutes. From Dwarahat one has to board a shared jeep which may charge somewhere between Rs. 40 to Rs. 50 for one way travel upto Kukuchina. For those who can afford for taxi, can hire taxi from Haldwani railway station itself, which do needs a good homework on the tariff and a pretty bargain. 


The Yogoda Satsanga Ashram at Dwarahat is nearly 1.5 kms away from Dwarahat bus stand. Members of the Satsanga alone have the privilege to stay at this ashram. Non-members can either prefer to stay at Dwarahat, which preferably has choice of hotels / resort (primitive range) or if one desires to stay away from the hustle bustle of market, Joshi restaurant at Kukuchina is suggested. This is a paying guest house, wherein the tariff for one night varies from Rs. 750 to 1800 depending upon the accommodation. There are rooms and cottages in the guest house. The guest house consist of a meditation hall too, which facilitates group meditation, if you plan a group trek to Babaji's cave. Very simple food (dal & roti) can be ordered in advance to Shri Joshi, who runs the guest house. Caution, there is no choice other than Joshi's guest house, if you want to buy food. Cooking your own food is also ruled out. Beware! if you are one who would need medical attention, there is no medical help available, except for the Gods whose abode is in the adjacent Himalayas.


Morning is the best time to start the trek towards Babaji's cave; because the weather in the hills is unpredictable. 25 meters from Joshi restaurant (actually a tea shop), there are 2 trek paths - one to Pandav Kholi and other to Babaji's cave. The entry to Pandav Kholi can be identified by a small welcome arch at the beginning of the trek; whereas to Babaji's cave, it is a simple pathway. The distance from Joshi's restaurant to Babaji's cave is around 2.5 kms to 3.0 kms. Walking all alone the entire path, one can immerse oneself in the scenic beauty of the mountains and thus get into that much needed meditation mood. The entire path is mostly deserted, except you can find one or two cattle boys or girls. The entire path is a mixture of sand & gravel. Sign boards in small size which indicate direction to the cave could be found to your left. However, these sign boards are not so prominent. After 30 to 40 minutes of the trek one may feel exhausted; for the normal trekkers it is advised that they carry along with them water or energy drinks. They can sit and relax for a few minutes and then proceed. After all you are there to enjoy the journey to the cave. By sitting and relaxing one can have a view of the majestic posture of the mountains and the tall mountains will make you feel humble. A normal trekker may take anywhere between 60 to 90 minutes to reach Babaji's cave. Before reaching the cave you will be coming across Smriti Bhavan which is a concrete structure. If desired one can meditate here also.


Sitting with closed eyes within Babaji's cave is a bliss. You choose to meditate, pray or simply sit and observe yourself. It is simply peace within the cave. The silence of the mountains perked up with croaking voice of insects and humming of bees makes it a perfect stage to meditate. It is suggested to leave the cave by 2.00 pm because it is better to reach Kukuchina before dusk starts settling down. Those who are physically and mentally strong can adventure to climb further up to reach Pandav Kholi which is another 60 to 90 minute climb; but there are no sign boards on the path from Babaji's cave to Pandav Kholi (8800 ft above sea level). Having a magi at Joshi's restaurant after the trek will quench your hunger and provide the physical energy to have a good sleep in the room or cottage.

==Modern claims and popular references==

Mahavatar Babaji was one of the many people featured on the cover of The Beatles' 1967 album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.<ref>http://www.spaciousplanet.com/world/guide/who-are-all-those-people-in-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band</ref>

In Book 3 of ''[[Conversations with God]]'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is suggested that Babaji may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead.<ref>Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.</ref>

In the Book ''Ultimate Journey'' (1994), by [[Robert Monroe]] Monroe visits a person through his astral projection (although no name is mentioned) who turns out to have lived one single life for 1800 years, which would suggest that he was born around 203 CE.

The 2002 [[Tamil film]] ''[[Baba (2002 film)|Baba]]'' written by [[Rajinikanth]] was based on Babaji.
[[Swami Maheshwarananda]] writes in his book ''The hidden power in humans'', that the Guru of the legendary Babaji is Sri Alakh Puriji.<ref>[[Swami Maheshwarananda]], ''The hidden power in humans'', Ibera Verlag, page 245. ISBN 3-85052-197-4</ref>

In his autobiography ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan master: a yogi's autobiography'' (2010), [[Sri M]] (Mumtaz Ali) narrates his meeting with Babaji near Neelkant hill.<ref>Sri M (Mumtaz Ali), ''Apprenticed to a Himalayan master: a yogi's autobiography'', Magenta Press, 2010, ISBN 8-19100-960-9</ref> In his book, Sri M gave description of Babaji as golden complexioned, bare-bodied, except for a shinning white loin cloth that barely reached the knees, and flowing brown hair that fell to his shoulders. He mentioned that a lovely scent emanated from Babaji and he looked divine.

The rock band ''[[Supertramp]]'' composed a song called "Babaji" in reference to Mahavatar Babaji.
