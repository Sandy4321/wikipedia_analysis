'''Charles Francis Adams, Sr.''' ([[August 18]], [[1807]] <U+2013> [[November 21]], [[1886]]) was an [[United States|American]] lawyer, politician, diplomat and writer.<ref>[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 6</ref>  He was the son of President [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Louisa Adams|Louisa Catherine Johnson]] and the grandson of President [[John Adams]] and [[Abigail Adams]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Boston]], and attended [[Boston Latin School]] and [[Harvard College]], where he graduated in 1825. He then studied law with [[Daniel Webster]], and practiced in Boston. He wrote numerous reviews of works about American and British history for the ''[[North American Review]].''

Adams was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in 1841, served in the [[Massachusetts Senate|state senate]] 1844<U+2013>1845, founded and edited the journal ''Boston Whig'' in 1846, and was the unsuccessful nominee of the [[Free Soil Party]] for [[Vice President of the United States]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1848|1848]].  In [[U.S. presidential election, 1872|1872]], he was again nominated for Vice President, this time by the so-called "Straight-Out Democrats," who were Democrats alienated by the Presidential candidacy of [[Horace Greeley]].<ref>http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1872&minper=0&f=0&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections. 1872 Presidential General Election Results (2005).</ref>

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Adams was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1858, where he chaired the Committee on Manufactures. He resigned to become Lincoln's minister (ambassador) to the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Court of St. James (Britain)]] from 1861 to 1868. Powerful Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]] had wanted the position, and became alienated from Adams. Britain had already recognized Confederate belligerency, but Adams was instrumental in maintaining British [[Neutral country|neutrality]] and preventing British diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy during the [[American Civil War]].  Adams and his son, [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]], who acted as his private secretary, also were kept busy monitoring Confederate diplomatic intrigues and the construction of rebel [[commerce raiders]] by British shipyards.

Back in Boston, Adams declined the presidency of [[Harvard University]], but became one of its overseers in 1869. In 1870 Charles Francis Adams built the first [[presidential library]] in the United States, to honor his father John Quincy Adams. The Stone Library includes over 14,000 books written in twelve languages. The library is located in the "Old House" at [[Adams National Historical Park]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]. During the [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876 electoral college controversy]], he sided with [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Samuel J. Tilden]] over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] for the [[President of the United States|presidency]].

Charles Francis Adams died in Boston on [[November 21]], [[1886]], and was interred in [[Mount Wollaston Cemetery]], Quincy.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Charles Francis Adams.
