It was released on DVD on February 5, 2008. 

==Plot==
The movie follows the story of Buddy and Molly's offspring in [[Washington]]. After saying goodbye to their owners one morning, the puppies decide to play [[hide-and-seek]] when Budderball finds an ice-cream truck. Rosebud spots the hapless canine and follows him in an attempt to help. Hilarity ensues when Buddha finds them both in the truck and B-Dog and Mud-Bud end up in the truck which is shipping to [[Alaska]]. 

In Alaska, the Buddies meet Shasta, a young husky whose owner wants nothing more than to [[Mushing|mush]]. The puppies take a vote to help a grateful Shasta to pursue his dreams. Unfortunately, as Shasta has no parents, this puts the puppies in a predicament as there is nobody to teach them how to become snow dogs and the local population of older puppies sneers at the thought of them learning how. Luckily, they find Talon, his father's mentor, in the mountains. Although initially reluctant, Shasta manages to persuade Talon into teaching the over-zealous puppies into becoming his new [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]]s by reminding him that "It's not the size of the dog that counts but the heart of team".

When Shasta introduces his owner, Adam, to his new sleigh team, the child is delighted at the prospect of his dreams coming true and the team pursue vigorous training routines  often to comedic effect.

Adam begins building a new sleigh with his team of hard-working puppies. Talon proudly watches as the team's efforts come to fruition and it seems as though they are cooperating as a team. The older town huskeys, however, are not impressed and begin to plan their downfall. They reveal to the Buddies that Shasta's parents died when the ice beneath them shattered to dishearten them.

Back in Washington, Buddy and Molly find Budderball's toy American football on the back of the ice-cream truck and proceed to take the same route the puppies did to Alaska.

Talon calls the puppies to the mountain late one night to view the [[aurora borealis|Northern Lights]] before he departs telling Shasta that he knows all he needs to know and that he can become the great leader that his father was. The following morning, the puppies enter the race with Adam. After being reminded by how treacherous the race is by the [[sheriff]], the puppies begin their trek.

Meanwhile, Buddy and Molly go looking for the puppies in Alaska where the rescue dog Bernie informs them of their participation in the race and, without further hesitation, the trio try to find the puppies. Adam's father also begins looking for his son.

The team manage to make it to the midway checkpoint without much difficulty.
The sheriff finally checks his email and finds out that the puppies in his town are actually the missing puppies from Washington. The [[snowstorm]] becomes more and more dangerous as Adam's father gets snowed in and Adam's main competitor and owner of the rival snow dogs begins cheating by sabotaging the competing sleds. Adam and the team take shelter in an [[igloo]] provided by an [[inuit]] until the storm subsides. They come head to head with their opponent, Jean George and Adam gets injured.

Adam then recovers. Jean George's dogs, the bullies from earlier get into trouble when the ice beneath them shatters. Jean George continues and abandons his dogs while Adam and the puppies begin a rescue operation despite Shasta's fears of his parents' deaths. The puppies pull the dogs out of the icy waters and Jean George resumes the race without any gratitude.

Jean George's dogs realize they owe nothing to their owner and everything to Shasta and the Buddies, and so, slow down causing Jean George to lose the race.
Adam is victorious and the Buddies reunite with Buddy and Molly. Jean George gives out to his dogs and they respond in kind by chasing him around the Arctic. All seven Buddies return home via airplane.They land and live happily ever after.

==Controversy==
Disney imported 20 under-aged golden retriever puppies from New York State, into Vancouver, Canada for the filming of the movie. A second group of 8 puppies, of eight weeks of age were brought to set one week later from Washington State.  Many of the puppies contracted the highly contagious [[parvovirus]], against which puppies are usually vaccinated at 8 weeks of age. At least 15 puppies showed signs of the illness, including parasitic infections of giardia and coccidia, and all were removed from the set. Three were [[euthanasia|euthanized]] for [[intussusception]] before the parvo outbreak, one for suspected parvo (but not confimred by necropsy) and one puppy who was returned to the breeder without being used reportedly died of parvo. The American Humane Association enforced the removal of the first two sets of puppies, and after a four week delay, during which time all puppies were quarantined until they were healthy, Disney hired 8 older puppies to continue filming. These puppies were joined by puppies from the second group who did not get ill from parvovirus and filming was completed. Five puppies died during the making of the movie.<ref>[http://www.americanhumane.org/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/snowbuddies.html American Humane Association Statement on Snow Buddies]</ref>
