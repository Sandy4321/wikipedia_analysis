'''Leslie Edward "Les" Claypool''' (born [[September 29]], [[1963]] in [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]]) is a [[musician]], best known for his work with the [[alternative metal]] band [[Primus (band)|Primus]]. Claypool's mastery of the [[Bass guitar|electric bass]] has brought him into the spotlight with his funky, creative playing style. Claypool mixes finger-tapping, [[flamenco]]-like strumming, and a [[Larry Graham]]-like slap technique to develop his own unique style and has earned respect as one of [[Rock music|rock]]'s premier bass talents, becoming an influence for younger bassists in recent years.  He is a [[multi-instrumentalist]], [[novelist]], music [[Record producer|producer]], [[actor]], and [[film director]].

Claypool has also self produced and engineered his solo releases from his own studio "Rancho Relaxo." In 2006 was the release of a full-length feature film ''[[Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo|Electric Apricot]]'' written and directed by Claypool as well as a debut novel ''[[South of the Pumphouse]]''.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Claypool was born [[September 29]] [[1963]] in [[Richmond, California]],
but was raised in [[El Sobrante, California]] in a working class family with a history of working as auto mechanics. His early education included Collins Elementary School and De Anza High School. Les's parents divorced when he was a young child, but he says that he had a decent childhood, citing that he was never abused or severely bullied.

Claypool was able to develop his [[Slapping|slap technique]] through listening to players like [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[Larry Graham]]. He also bought his first [[Carl Thompson (guitarist)|Carl Thompson]] bass, his trademark four string bass. (He now owns six, including a multi-wood fretless 6-string called the [[Rainbow Bass]].)

In 1986, after the death of [[Metallica]] bassist [[Cliff Burton]], Claypool auditioned to play bass for Metallica, playing the song "Master of Puppets" on his bass. In Metallica's [[Behind the Music]], Claypool said that during the audition he wanted the others to "jam on some [[Isley Brothers]] tunes," after which [[Lars Ulrich]] asked whether he's "not really used to playing this kind of music." [[James Hetfield]] remarked that Claypool didn't win the job because "he was too good."

===Primus===
{{main|Primus (band)}}
[[Primus (band)|Primus]] began as Primate with Les Claypool, guitarist [[Todd Huth]] and various drummers, most notably [[Jay Lane]], in the mid-1980s, though Huth and Lane left shortly thereafter to pursue other projects. Claypool replaced them with guitarist [[Larry LaLonde]] and eclectic drummer [[Tim Alexander]] in 1989. Primus began selling out local clubs with their out-of-control live act and irreverent approach to music (their catchphrase was "Primus sucks!").

From 1989 to 2000, Primus steadily became one of the most bizarre bands to gain significant mainstream airplay, headlining [[Lollapalooza]] in 1993, appearing on [[David Letterman]] and [[Conan O'Brien]] in 1995, and even making an appearance at [[Woodstock '94]] where they performed their ''[[Pork Soda]]'' hit "[[My Name Is Mud]]" and were pelted with mud (Claypool claims to have mud still in his speakers). Also, in 1997, they were asked to play, and record, the theme song for the  animated television show ''[[South Park]]''. Claypool and [[Tom Waits]] have recorded on each other's records since 1991 and have continued to do so.  In 1999 he let Activision use the song "Jerry Was a Race Car Driver" on the hit video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.  

In 2000 Primus went on indefinite hiatus. A few months later in October Claypool officially disbanded them.

In late 2003 Claypool reunited with former [[Primus (band)|Primus]] drummer [[Tim Alexander]] and guitarist [[Ler LaLonde|Larry LaLonde]] to record a DVD/EP called ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]]'', which Claypool described as the first DVD with supplementary music, as opposed to the contrary. The band staged a two month tour in which they performed two sets per show, the second consisting of their 1991 release ''[[Sailing the Seas of Cheese]]'' in its entirety. They continued touring into 2004, even performing their 1990 release ''[[Frizzle Fry]]'' in its entirety.

In Mid-August of 2006, a DVD release entitled ''Blame It on the Fish'' was added to the listings of Amazon and other online shops. Shortly thereafter, the website ''The PRP'' reported that a rumor had surfaced implying that the band was quietly planning a North American tour for November/December 2006.<ref>{{cite web | title=Those Damn Blue Collared Tours | url=http://www.theprp.com/oldnews/41111168.shtml | accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> 

On October 17, 2006, Primus released both their first greatest hits CD ''[[They Can't All Be Zingers]]'' and their third DVD ''[[Blame It on the Fish (DVD)|Blame It on The Fish]],'' subtitled ''An Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour De Fromage.''

''They Can't All Be Zingers'' includes sixteen digitally remastered songs that span their entire career, including a previously unreleased and extended version of "[[Shake Hands with Beef]]," the [[Tom Waits]] collaboration "Coattails of a Deadman," and "Mary the Ice Cube" from the 2003 DVD and EP ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]].''

Claypool has let the video game ''[[Guitar Hero 2]]'' use the Primus song, "John the Fisherman," one of two songs in the game using the actual recording instead of a cover.

''Blame It on the Fish: An Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour De Fromage'' contains live footage from the band's 2003 reunion tour, interview segments and behind the scenes footage. The DVD includes a 70 minute feature film and 90 minutes of bonus material, including a 30 minute [[mockumentary]] about the band in 2065. ''Blame It on the Fish'' is directed by [[Matthew J. Powers]], who directed ''Never Been Done'', a documentary about [[Jon Comer]].

[[Primus: The Beat A Dead Horse Tour 2006]] began in November 2006 and was completed the following December.

Les Claypool let the DC snowboard team use the Primus song "Jerry Was a Race Car Driver" in their 2007 movie "DC Mt. Lab 1.5"

===Solo work===
====1994 - 2001====
=====Sausage=====
In 1994, Claypool teamed up with guitarist Todd Huth and drummer Jay Lane to create an early Primus sound. Songs such as "Riddles are Abound Tonight" and "toyz 1988" (now known as "Toys Go Winding Down") gave way to a whole new breed of music.

=====Holy Mackerel=====
In 1996 Claypool produced, engineered and released a solo album, "Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel presents" ''[[Highball with the Devil]]''. Claypool is credited with bass, drums and vocals on several tracks as well as guitar. Also on the album are [[M.I.R.V.|Mark "Mirv" Haggard]], [[Adam Gates]], [[Jay Lane]], Joe Gore, [[Charlie Hunter]] and [[Henry Rollins]]. The accompanying tour included Haggard and Gates on guitars with [[Bryan "Brain" Mantia]] on drums. Mantia was also a new member of Primus at that time.
=====Oysterhead=====
{{main|Oysterhead}}
In April 2000, Claypool collaborated with [[Trey Anastasio]] (of [[Phish]]) and [[Stewart Copeland]] (of [[The Police]]) as [[Oysterhead]]. Claypool and Anastasio had been looking for an opportunity to collaborate. Each had a mutual interest in playing with Copeland who had been a rock idol of their teen years. Also, Claypool and Copeland had an established friendship. Oysterhead were originally intended as a one time performance during [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival|Jazz Fest]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. Though timid of the band's sudden and surprising popularity they eventually decided to record and tour.<ref name="frogs&oysters">[http://www.jambase.com/Articles/Story.aspx?StoryID=859 FROGS & OYSTERS: A LES CLAYPOOL INTERVIEW] Mike Powers, ''jambase.com'', 1/26/01, Retrieved [[January 26]] [[2008]]</ref> They released one studio album, ''[[The Grand Pecking Order]]'', and toured before disbanding in 2001. They re-united for one performance at the 2006 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]].
=====The Frog Brigade=====
{{main|Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade}}
In May 2000 Claypool formed [[Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade]], an experimental ensemble in the vein of The Mothers of Invention.  Claypool was asked to put together a band for the Mountain Aire Festival in [[Angels Camp, California]]. The band "of the most incredible guys (he) could possibly find" debuted that Memorial Day weekend and played a number of other festivals including [[moe.#moe.down|moe.down]].<ref name="frogs&oysters" /> Originally he was going to call the band "Les Claypool's Thunder Brigade." Claypool states:<blockquote>I originally was going to do the two drummer thing with [[Tim Alexander|Herb]] and [[Jack Irons]], so I was gonna call it the Les Claypool Thunder Brigade. Michael Bailey from [[Bill Graham Presents]] said to me that it may sound a bit too heavy for the Mountain Aire crowd and to perhaps try something a little different that had to do with the event itself. Since it was home of the Calaveras County Frog Jump... hence the Frog Brigade and then it evolved into Colonel Les Claypool<U+2019>s Fearless Flying Frog Brigade.<ref name="frogs&oysters" /></blockquote>

The Primus hiatus allowed him to return to his musical roots, playing songs by bands like [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], and [[The Beatles]]. Claypool has called the Frog Brigade his "[[mid-life crisis]] band."  From a set of October shows recorded at The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco Claypool released two Frog Brigade live albums, one being a cover of [[Pink Floyd|Pink Floyd's]] ''[[Animals (album)|Animals]]''. The line-up included [[Todd Huth]], [[Eenor]], [[Jeff Chimenti]], [[Jay Lane]], [[Skerik]] and Claypool. 

The Frog Brigade is also noted for Claypool's being accepted into the [[jam band]] scene.<ref>''Jambands'', Dean Budnick, Backbeat Books, 2003, pp 248-9</ref> ''[[Live Frogs Set 1]]'' won "Best Live Album" at the second annual [[Jammys]]. Jay Lane and Jeff Chimenti are both members of [[Bob Weir]]'s band [[Ratdog]]. Claypool performed with "The Rat Brigade" when opening for Ratdog once in 2000 and again in 2007. The Rat Brigade includes Claypool, drummer Lane and keyboardist Chimenti, with guest appearances by saxophonist Kenny Brooks and Bob Weir. Both years Claypool also guested on the Ratdog set.

====2002 - 2005====
In 2002 Claypool released a studio album of the Frog Brigade, ''[[Purple Onion]]''. Musicians on multiple tracks for ''Purple Onion'' include Eenor, [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Mike Dillon]], Skerik, Jay Lane, Ben Barnes and Sam Bass (Dillon and Skerik were both from [[Critters Buggin]] while Barnes and Sam Bass were from [[Deadweight (U.S. band)|Deadweight]]). This album includes "Whamola" which later appeared as a remix for the theme of [[South Park]] [[List_of_South_Park_episodes#Season_10:_2006|Season 10]].
===== C2B3 =====
{{main|Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains}}
Also in 2002 Claypool collaborated with virtuoso guitarist [[Buckethead]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]/[[Talking Heads]] keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]], and former [[Primus (band)|Primus]] drummer [[Bryan Mantia]] under the name [[Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains]] ("C2B3"). Their concerts pushed the improvisational envelope by preparing no material and not rehearsing beforehand. At one of their shows they prepared sandwiches onstage for the audience to eat.

C2B3 re-united in 2004 to record ''[[The Big Eyeball in the Sky]]'', an album with equal parts instrumental and vocal songs. The band began an 18-state [http://www.c2b3.com/tour/ tour] of the [[United States|US]] on [[September 24]], [[2004]]. The album features only one guest, the child-like multi-instrumentalist [[Gabby La La]] (noted as Gabby Lang on [[Les Claypool's Frog Brigade]]'s [[Purple Onion]]) on vocals and sitar. She also opened on every show (sometimes to scathingly negative reviews) during the 2004 tour as a solo act with sometimes members of C2B3.

Claypool also [[Record producer|produced]] and performed on [[Gabby La La]]'s first album, ''[[Be Careful What You Wish For...]]''. Gabby La La is the first artist Les has signed to his label since Charlie Hunter in 1993. He has performed select shows with her (including the 2005 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]]) and added her to his then new touring band, [[Les Claypool's Fancy Band|Les Claypool & His Fancy Band]]. The 2005 Fancy Band line-up also included Skerik, Dillon and Lane.

At the end of 2005, Claypool released ''[[5 Gallons Of Diesel]]'', a video retrospective of all of his work away from Primus.

==== 2006 ====
===== ''Electric Apricot'' =====
{{main|Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo}}
Claypool's first attempt at a feature length film, ''[[Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo]]'', was shown on various film festivals in the late spring of 2006. The movie is a spoof of the jam band scene centered on the fake band, Electric Apricot, in the mockumentary tradition of ''[[Spinal Tap]]''.<ref name="jambasearticle">[http://www.jambase.com/Articles/Story.aspx?StoryID=8945&pagenum=0 "Les Claypool: The Art of Falling"]. ''[[JamBase]]''. 2006. Retrieved [[February 2]], [[2008]].</ref> The group performed low-key shows in the [[California]] area (most recently [[High Sierra Music Festival]]) for the filming of the movie. The members of the band are characterized as Steve Hampton Trouzdale (Adam Gates) on bass and vocals, Steve "Gordo" Gordon (Brian Kehoe) on guitar and vocals, Herschal Tambor Brillstien (Jonathan Korty) on keyboards and vocals, and of course Lapland "Lapdog" Miclovik (Les Claypool) on drums and vocals. The film debuted on March 15. During a question and answer session at the Tiburon Film Festival where the film debuted Claypool said that the yet unreleased DVD would have an accompanying soundtrack CD.  The film has won other awards as well including Best Feature (audience choice) at the [[Malibu, California#Arts and culture|Malibu Film Festival]].  Claypool also said that the band would possibly perform a few select shows, but a tour is unlikely as Adam Gates has a job at [[Pixar]] which makes touring difficult.
===== ''Of Whales and Woe'' and the Fancy Band =====
{{main|Of Whales and Woe|Les Claypool's Fancy Band}}
On May 30, 2006 Claypool released a solo album, ''[[Of Whales and Woe]]'', with guest appearances by Skerik, Mike Dillon and Gabby La La. This album includes the song "Robot Chicken," which is the theme song of the popular [[Adult Swim]] show. His son Cage and his daughter Lena even make a special appearance on the song "Back Off Turkey." The release was followed by a tour of the U.S. with the following lineup: Les Claypool - bass, vocals; Skerik - sax; Mike Dillon - vibraphone, percussion; Gabby La La - sitar, theremin; [[Paulo Baldi]] - drums. This lineup is called [[Les Claypool's Fancy Band]] and did national tours in both 2006 and 2007. A live DVD, ''[[Fancy (DVD)|Fancy]]'', recorded from the 2006 tour was released in 2007. The audio track includes a mix of both soundboard and [[Bootleg recording#Authorized live bootlegs|taper recordings]].

===== ''South of the Pumphouse'' =====
{{main|South of the Pumphouse}}
Claypool's first book, ''[[South of the Pumphouse]]'', was released on [[July 1]], 2006 by [[Akashic Books]]. Copies of the book were sold during Claypool's 2006 tour of U.S.A. following the release of ''[[Of Whales and Woe]]''. The book is a dark, clever tale of brothers, murder, drugs, and fishing, and it has been likened to the work of [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. Claypool gave his [http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002501410 first interview] about the book to The Book Standard, on May 11, 2006. ''[[South of the Pumphouse]]'' is currently in its fifth printing.

==== 2007 - present ====
Besides touring in the Summer of 2007 nationally with the Fancy Band, Claypool performed that October with a version of the band, dubbed the Fancy Trio. The trio consisted of Les, Skerik on saxophone, and Mike Dillon on drums, vibraphone and percussion. They played at [http://www.the-echoproject.com The Echo Project], an inaugural ecologically minded 3-day festival in [[Fairburn]], Ga on The Boukeart family farm. The set was similar to that of The Fancy Band's tours, culling from Les' solo and Frog Brigade albums, as well containing a cover of "[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]" by [[Madness]] and teases of other songs, including several Primus tunes, throughout their improvisational jams.

For many years Claypool has done a New Years Eve show at [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco, California]]. More recently the New Years Eve show has been an Annual New Year's Eve Hatter's Ball featuring a hat contest. [[December 31]] [[2007]] was the 3rd such annual event.

In 2008 a United States tour spanned from [[February 29]] to [[April 5]]. It kicked off at the Neighborhood Theatre in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and ended at [[The Warfield]] in [[San Francisco, California]]. The 2008 tour was a quartet featuring Claypool, Dillon, Skerik and Baldi. 

''[[Pig Hunt]]'' is a film directed by James Isaac to be released in 2008. Claypool contributes previously unreleased material and plays the role of "The Preacher".<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022883/ Pig Hunt] at [[IMDB]]</ref><ref>[http://www.pighuntmovie.com/ Pig Hunt] - official site</ref>

Les composed all of the music for the upcoming [[Wii]] game [[Mushroom Men]], to be released in October 2008. <ref>www.lesclaypool.com</ref>

===Personal life===
He lives near the village of [[Occidental, California|Occidental]] in [[Sonoma County, California]] with his wife, Chaney Claypool, his son, Cage Oliver Claypool, and his daughter Lena Tallulah Claypool. His home is called "Rancho Relaxo" after a [[Homer Alone|Simpsons episode where Marge gets sent to a spa of the same name]]. He records most of his music at his home. He is famous for his wacky sense of humor and overall very [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] personality. He has recently been very open about his [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] politics and his dissatisfaction with current president [[George W. Bush]].

Claypool is an avid fisherman and even appeared as a special guest on a 2004 taping of [[Fly Fishing the World]] filmed in [[Idaho]] and a 2005 taping in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. Both episodes are available on the extras section of [[5 Gallons Of Diesel]].
