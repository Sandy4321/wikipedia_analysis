'''Keyhole Island''' ({{coord|68|47|S|67|20|W|display=inline,title}}) is a small rocky [[island]] lying 5 nautical miles (9&nbsp;km) southeast of the [[Terra Firma Islands]] in the southwest part of [[Mikkelsen Bay]], off the west coast of [[Graham Land]]. First surveyed in 1948 by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] (FIDS), who applied this name because of the presence of an ice arch formed by the icecap on this island.
