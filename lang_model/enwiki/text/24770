A '''library''' is a collection of sources, resources, and services, and the structure in which it is housed; it is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, or a private individual.  In the more traditional sense, a library is a [[Category of sets|collection]] of [[books]].  It can mean the collection, the building or room that houses such a collection, or both. The term "library" has itself acquired a secondary meaning: "a collection of useful material for common use," and in this sense is used in fields such as [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[Library (electronics)|electronics]] and [[Library (biology)|biology]]. 

Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to <U+2014> or cannot afford to <U+2014> purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of [[librarian]]s who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs.

However, with the sets and collection of media and of [[data storage device|media]] other than books for [[recording|storing information]], many libraries are now also repositories and access points for [[map]]s, [[print room|prints]], or other [[documents]] and various storage media such as [[microform]] (microfilm/microfiche), [[audio tape]]s, [[compact disc|CDs]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[videotape]]s, [[DVD]]s, and [[video games]].  Libraries may also provide public facilities to access subscription databases and the [[Internet]].

Thus, modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to [[information]] in many formats and from many sources. They are understood as extending beyond the physical walls of a building, by including material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing tremendous amounts of knowledge with a variety of digital tools.

==Early history==
===Antiquity===
[[File:BNCF 7.JPG|thumb|[[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library of Florence]] in [[Italy]].]]
The first two libraries were composed for the most part, of published [[document|records]], a particular type of library called [[archives]].  Archaeological findings from the ancient [[city-states]] of [[Sumer]] have revealed temple rooms full of [[clay tablet]]s in [[cuneiform script]].  These archives were made up almost completely of the records of commercial transactions or inventories, with only a few documents touching theological matters, historical records or legends.  Things were much the same in the government and temple records on [[papyrus]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].

The earliest discovered private archives were kept at [[Ugarit]]; besides correspondence and inventories, texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes. There is also evidence of libraries at [[Nippur]] about 1900 B.C. and those at [[Nineveh]] about 700 B.C. showing a [[library classification]] system.<ref>''The American International Encyclopedia'', J.J. Little & Ives, New York 1954, Volume IX</ref>  

Over 30,000 clay tablets from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] have been discovered at [[Nineveh]] <ref>http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/research_projects/ashurbanipal_library_phase_1.aspx "Assurbanipal Library Phase 1", British Museum One</ref>, providing archaeologists with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work.  Among the findings were 
the [[Enuma Elish]] , also known as ''the Epic of Creation,''<ref>Epic of Creation in Dalley, Stephanie. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989: pg.233-81</ref> which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creation, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]<ref>Epic of Gilgamesh in Dalley, Stephanie. ''Myths from Mesopotamia.'' Oxford, 1989: pg.50-135</ref>, a large selection of <U+201C>omen texts<U+201D> including ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' which <U+201C>contained omens dealing with the moon, its visibility, eclipses, and conjunction with planets and fixed stars, the sun, its corona, spots, and eclipses, the weather, namely lightning, thunder, and clouds, and the planets and their visibility, appearance, and stations.<U+201D><ref>Van De Mieroop, Marc. A History of the Ancient Near East ca. 3000-323 BC. Oxford,UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd., 2007: pg. 263
</ref>, and astronomic/astrological texts, as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists, bilingual vocabularies, lists of signs and synonyms, and lists of medical diagnoses.

===Libraries in Persian Empire===
During the [[Achaemenid Persian Empire]] (558<U+2013>330 BC) the religious and scientific books of [[Persia]] since [[Zoroaster]], were archived in the libraries of "Ganj-i-hapigan" in [[Takht-i-Suleiman]] and "Dez-i-Napesht" in [[Persepolis]].<ref>Denkard (4:15) [http://avesta.org/denkard/dk4.html link]</ref> These books were probably in the fields of [[philosophy]], [[astronomy]], [[alchemy]] and [[medical sciences]], the fields in which [[Magus]] of [[Persia]] were master in. After the invasion of [[Persia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] all these books were burned. It has been mentioned in the book [[Arda Viraf]] that <ref>Arda Viraf (1:1:4-8) [http://www.avesta.org/mp/viraf.html link]</ref>: 
<blockquote>
"He came to Persia  with severe cruelty and war and devastation... and destroyed the metropolis and empire, and made them desolate... all the avesta and zand, written upon prepared cow-skins and with gold ink, was deposited in the archives... he burned them up."
</blockquote>
In [[Iran|Persia]] many libraries were established by the [[Zoroastrian]] elite and the [[Persian Kings]]. Among the first ones was a royal library in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. One of the most important public libraries established around 667 AD in southwestern [[Iran]] was the [[Library of Gundishapur]]. It was a part of a bigger scientific complex located at the [[Academy of Gundishapur]]..

===Libraries in the Hellenic world and Rome===
Private or personal libraries made up of [[non-fiction]] and [[fiction]] books (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives) appeared in [[classical Greece]] in the 5th century BC. The celebrated book collectors of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] were listed in the late second century in ''[[Deipnosophistae]]:''<ref>Epitome of Book I</ref>

<blockquote>[[Polycrates of Samos]] and [[Peisistratos (Athens)|Pisistratus]] who was tyrant of Athens, and Euclides who was himself also an Athenian<ref>Not the familiar [[Euclid]].</ref> and Nicorrates of Samos and even the kings of [[Pergamum|Pergamos]], and [[Euripides]] the poet and [[Aristotle]] the philosopher, and Nelius his librarian; from whom they say our countryman<ref>The writer was Alexandrian; the sophisticates in ''Deipnosophistae'' were at a banquet in Rome.</ref> [[Ptolemy Philadelphus|Ptolem<U+00E6>us, surnamed Philadelphus]], bought them all, and transported them, with all those which he had collected at Athens and at Rhodes to his own beautiful Alexandria.<ref>See [[Library of Alexandria]].</ref></blockquote> 

All these libraries were Greek; the cultivated Hellenized diners in ''Deipnosophistae'' pass over the libraries of Rome in silence. By the time of Augustus there were public libraries near the forums of Rome: there were libraries in the [[Porticus Octaviae]] near the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Biblioteca Ulpiana in the [[Forum of Trajan]]. The state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the [[Roman Forum]] and the [[Capitoline Hill]]. 

Private libraries appeared during the late republic: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by non-reading owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime, but displayed the scrolls in bookcases (''armaria'') of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: "by now, like bathrooms and hot water, a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house (''[[domus]]'').<ref>Seneca, ''De tranquillitate animi'' ix.4-7.</ref>  Libraries were amenities suited to a villa, such as Cicero's at Tusculum, [[Maecenas]]'s several villas, or [[Livy the Younger]]'s, all described in surving letters. At the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]], apparently the villa of Caesar's father-in-law, the Greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash; archaeologists speculate that a Latin library, kept separate from the Greek one, may await discovery at the site.

In the West, the first public libraries were established under the [[Roman Empire]] as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor.   Unlike the Greek libraries, readers had direct access to the scrolls, which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room. Reading or copying was normally done in the room itself.  The surviving records give only a few instances of lending features.  As a rule Roman public libraries were bilingual:  they had a Latin room and a Greek room.  Most of the large [[Roman bath]]s  were also cultural centers, built from the start with a library, with the usual two room arrangement for Greek and Latin texts.  

Libraries were filled with [[parchment]] [[scroll (parchment)|scrolls]] as at [[Library of Pergamum]] and on [[papyrus]] scrolls as at [[Alexandria]]: export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce.  There were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public (like the [[Library of Alexandria]], once the largest [[Great libraries of the ancient world|library in the ancient world]]), but on the whole collections were private.  In those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks.  In all recorded cases the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers, who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway.

In the sixth century, at the very close of the [[Classical period]], the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of [[Constantinople]] and Alexandria. [[Cassiodorus]], minister to Theodoric, established a monastery at Vivarium in the heel of Italy with a library where  he attempted to bring Greek learning to Latin readers and preserve texts both sacred and secular for future generations. As its unofficial librarian, Cassiodorus not only collected as many manuscripts as he could, he also wrote treatises aimed at instructing his monks in the proper uses of reading and methods for copying texts accurately. In the end, however, the library at Vivarium was dispersed and lost within a century. 

Through [[Origen]] and especially the scholarly presbyter [[Pamphilus of Caesarea]], an avid collector of books of Scripture, the theological school of Caesarea won a reputation for having [[Pamphilus of Caesarea|the most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time]], containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: [[Gregory Nazianzus]], [[Basil the Great]], [[Jerome]] and others came to study there.

With education firmly in Christian hands, however, many of the works of classical antiquity were no longer considered useful. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  Old texts were washed off the valuable parchment and papyrus, which were reused, forming [[palimpsests]]. As scrolls gave way to the new book-form, the [[codex]], which was universally used for Christian literature, old manuscript scrolls were cut apart and used to stiffen leather bindings. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Ancient Chinese libraries===
Little is known about early [[China|Chinese]] libraries{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, save what is written about the imperial library which began with the [[Qin Dynasty]].  One of the curators of the imperial library in the [[Han Dynasty]] is believed to have been the first to establish a library classification system and the first book notation system.  At this time the library catalog was written on scrolls of fine [[silk]] and stored in silk bags.

===Islamic libraries===
{{Refimprovesect|date=September 2009}}
Upon the rise of [[Islam]], libraries in [[Islamic Golden Age|newly Islamic lands]] knew a brief period of expansion in the Middle East, [[North Africa]], [[Sicily]] and [[Spain]]. Like the Christian libraries, they mostly contained books which were made of [[paper]], and took a [[codex]] or modern form instead of scrolls; they could be found in mosques, private homes, and universities. In Aleppo, for example, the largest and probably the oldest mosque library, the Sufiya, located at the city's Grand Umayyad Mosque, contained a large book collection of which 10,000 volumes were reportedly bequeathed by the city's most famous ruler, Prince Sayf al-Dawla.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mosque libraries: An Historical Study|author=Sibai M. |year=1987|publisher=Mansell Publishing Limited,p.71}}</ref> Some mosques sponsored [[public library|public libraries]]. [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s bibliography ''Fihrist'' demonstrates the devotion of medieval Muslim scholars to books and reliable sources; it contains a description of thousands of books circulating in the Islamic world circa 1000, including an entire section for books about the doctrines of other religions. Unfortunately, modern Islamic libraries for the most part do not hold these antique books; many were lost, [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|destroyed by Mongols]], or removed to European libraries and museums during the colonial period.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World|author=John L. Esposito (ed.)|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-506613-8}}</ref>

By the 8th century first [[Iranians]] and then [[Arab]]s had imported the craft of [[papermaking]] from China, with a [[paper mill]] already at work in [[Baghdad]] in 794. By the 9th century completely [[public libraries]] started to appear in many Islamic cities. They were called "halls of Science" or ''dar al-'ilm''. They were each endowed by [[Islam]]ic sects with the purpose of representing their tenets as well as promoting the dissemination of secular knowledge.  The 9th century [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] of [[Iraq]], even ordered the construction of a <U+2018>zawiyat qurra'' literally an enclosure for readers which was `lavishly furnished and equipped.' ''In [[Shiraz]] Adhud al-Daula (d. 983) set up a library, described by the medieval historian, [[al-Muqaddasi]], as''`a complex of buildings surrounded by gardens with lakes and waterways. The buildings were topped with domes, and comprised an upper and a lower story with a total, according to the chief official, of 360 rooms....  In each [[Departmentalization|department]], [[catalogue]]s were placed on a shelf... the rooms were furnished with carpets...'.<ref>{{cite book|title=AL-Muqaddasi: Ahsan al-Taqasim|author=de Goeje(ed.)|year=1906|publisher=BGA, III|unused_data=|Leiden, p.449}}</ref> ''The libraries often employed translators and copyists in large numbers, in order to render into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] the bulk of the available [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Roman and [[Sanskrit]] non-fiction and the classics of literature. This flowering of Islamic learning ceased centuries later when learning began declining in the [[Islamic world]], after many of these libraries were destroyed by [[Mongol invasions]]. Others were victim of wars and religious strife in the Islamic world.'' ''However, a few examples of these medieval libraries, such as the libraries of [[Chinguetti]] in [[West Africa]], remain intact and relatively unchanged even today. Another ancient library from this period which is still operational and expanding is the [[Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi]] in the Iranian city of [[Mashhad]], which has been operating for more than six centuries.''

A number of distinct features of the modern library were introduced in the Islamic world, where libraries not only served as a collection of manuscripts as was the case in ancient libraries, but also as a public library and [[lending library]], a centre for the instruction and spread of sciences and ideas, a place for meetings and discussions, and sometimes as a [[lodging]] for scholars or [[boarding school]] for pupils. The concept of the [[library catalog]]ue was also introduced in medieval Islamic libraries, where books were organized into specific [[genre]]s and categories.<ref>{{citation|last=Micheau|first=Francoise|contribution=The Scientific Institutions in the Medieval Near East|pages=988<U+2013>991}} in {{Citation |last1=Morelon |first1=R<U+00E9>gis |last2=Rashed |first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0415124107 |pp=985-1007}}</ref>

The contents of these Islamic libraries were copied by Christian monks in Muslim/Christian border areas, particularly Spain and Sicily.  From there they eventually made their way into other parts of Christian [[Europe]].  These copies joined works that had been preserved directly by Christian monks from Greek and Roman originals, as well as copies Western Christian monks made of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] works.  The resulting conglomerate libraries are the basis of every modern library today.

===Medieval Christian libraries===
{{Refimprovesect|date=September 2009}}

[[File:Bibl. Malatestiana 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Malatestiana Library]] ({{lang-it|'Biblioteca Malatestiana'}}), in [[Cesena]], is the first [[Europe]]an civic library<ref>http://www.stradavinisaporifc.it/cesena.asp</ref>.]]

With the retrenchment of literacy in the Roman west during the fourth and fifth centuries, fewer private libraries were maintained, and those in unfortified [[Roman villa|villas]] proved to be among their most combustible contents.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] and before the rise of the large Western [[Christianity|Christian]] [[monastery]] libraries beginning at [[Montecassino]], libraries were found in scattered places in the Christian [[Middle East]].

Medieval library design reflected the fact that these manuscripts <U+2014>created via the labor-intensive process of hand copying<U+2014> were valuable possessions. Library architecture developed in response to the need for security. Librarians often chained books to [[lectern]]s, [[armaria]] (wooden chests), or [[bookshelf|shelves]], in well-lit rooms. Despite this protectiveness, many libraries were willing to lend their books if provided with security deposits (usually money or a book of equal value). Monastic libraries lent and borrowed books from each other frequently and lending policy was often theologically grounded. For example, the Franciscan monasteries loaned books to each other without a security deposit since according to their vow of poverty only the entire order could own property. In 1212 the council of Paris condemned those monasteries that still forbade loaning books, reminding them that lending is "one of the chief works of mercy." <ref>{{cite book|title=Books and Their Makers in the Middle Ages|author=Geo. Haven Putnam|year=1962|publisher=Hillary}}</ref>

Lending meant more than just having another work to read to librarians; while the work was in their possession, it could be copied, thus enriching the library's own collection.  The book lent as a counter effort was often copied in the same way, so both libraries ended up having an additional title.

The early libraries located in monastic [[cloister]]s and associated with [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] were collections of lecterns with books chained to them. Shelves built above and between back-to-back lecterns were the beginning of [[bookpress]]es. The chain was attached at the fore-edge of a book rather than to its spine. Book presses came to be arranged in [[carrel desk|carrels]] (perpendicular to the walls and therefore to the windows) in order to maximize lighting, with low bookcases in front of the windows. This ''stall system'' (fixed bookcases perpendicular to exterior walls pierced by closely spaced windows) was characteristic of [[England|English]] institutional libraries. In [[Continental Europe|Continental]] libraries, bookcases were arranged parallel to and against the walls. This ''wall system'' was first introduced on a large scale in Spain's [[El Escorial]].

===Early modern libraries===
[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s movable type innovation in the 1400s revolutionized bookmaking. From the 15th century in central and northern Italy, the assiduously assembled libraries of [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and their enlightened patrons provided a nucleus around which an "[[academy]]" of scholars congregated in each Italian city of consequence. [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]] established his own collection, which formed the basis of the [[Laurentian Library]].<ref>[http://www.history-magazine.com/libraries.html Survivor: The History of the Library]</ref> In Rome, the papal collections were brought together by [[Pope Nicholas V]], in separate Greek and Latin libraries, and housed by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], who consigned the [[Vatican Library|Bibliotheca Apostolica Vaticana]] to the care of his librarian, the humanist [[Bartolomeo Platina]] in February 1475.<ref>This section on Roman Renaissance libraries follows Kenneth M. Setton, "From Medieval to Modern Library" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' '''104'''.4, Dedication of the APS Library Hall, Autumn General Meeting, November, 1959 (August 1960:371-390) p372ff.</ref> In the 16th century [[Pope Sixtus V|Sixtus V]] bisected Bramante's [[Cortile del Belvedere]] with a cross-wing to house the Apostolic Library in suitable magnificence. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw other privately-endowed libraries assembled in Rome: the Vallicelliana, formed from the books of Saint [[Filippo Neri]], with other distinguished libraries such as that of [[Cesare Baronio]], the Biblioteca Angelica founded by the Augustinian [[Angelo Rocca]], which was the only truly public library in Counter-Reformation Rome; the Biblioteca Alessandrina with which [[Pope Alexander VII]] endowed the [[University of Rome]]; the Biblioteca Casanatense of the Cardinal [[Girolamo Casanate]]; and finally the Biblioteca Corsiniana founded by the bibliophile [[Pope Clement XII|Clement XII Corsini]] and his nephew Cardinal Neri Corsini, still housed in Palazzo Corsini in via della Lungara. 

A lot of factors combined to create a "golden age of libraries" between 1600 and 1700: The quantity of books had gone up, as the cost had gone down, there was a renewal in the interest of classical literature and culture, nationalism was encouraging nations to build great libraries, universities were playing a more prominent role in education, and renaissance thinkers and writers were producing great works. Some of the more important libraries include the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford, the Library of the [[British Museum]], the [[Biblioth<U+00E8>que Mazarine|Mazarine Library]] in Paris, and the [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]] in Italy, the [[Prussian State Library]], the [[M.E. Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library]] of St. Petersburg, and many more.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Information and Storage Retrieval|author=Stockwell, Foster |date=2000|North Carolina: McFarland & Company}}</ref>

==Types of libraries==

Libraries can be divided into categories by several methods: 
;by the entity (institution, municipality, or corporate body) that supports or perpetuates them
** [[Academic library|academic libraries]]
** corporate libraries
** government libraries, such as [[national library|national libraries]]
** [[historical society]] libraries
** [[Private library|private libraries]]
** [[public library|public libraries]]
** [[School library|school libraries]]
** [[special library|special libraries]]
;by the type of documents or materials they hold
** [[data library|data libraries]]
** [[digital library|digital libraries]]
** picture (photograph) libraries
** slide libraries
** [[list of tool-lending libraries|tool libraries]]
;by the subject matter of documents they hold
** architecture libraries
** fine arts libraries
** [[Law library|law libraries]]
** [[Medical library|medical libraries]]
** theological libraries (See: [[Theological Libraries and Librarianship]])
;by the users they serve
** military communities
** users who are blind or visually/physically handicapped (see [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]])
;by traditional professional divisions:
** [[Academic libraries]] <U+2014> These libraries are located on the campuses of colleges and universities and serve primarily the students and faculty of that and other academic institutions. Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part.
** [[public library|Public libraries]] or ''public lending libraries'' <U+2014> These libraries provide service to the general public and make at least some of their books available for borrowing, so that readers may use them at home over a period of days or weeks. Typically, libraries issue [[library card]]s to community members wishing to borrow books.  Many public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time. 
** [[Research library|Research libraries]] <U+2014> These libraries are intended for supporting scholarly research, and therefore maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary material. Research libraries are most often [[academic libraries]] or [[national libraries]], but many large [[special library|special libraries]] have research libraries within their special field and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries.
** [[School library|School libraries]] <U+2014> Most public and private primary and secondary schools have libraries designed to support the school's curriculum.   
** [[Special library|Special libraries]] <U+2014> All other libraries fall into this category.  Many private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work. Special libraries may or may not be accessible to some identified part of the general public. Branches of a large academic or research libraries dealing with particular subjects are also usually called "special libraries": they are generally associated with one or more academic departments. Special libraries are distinguished from  [[special collections]], which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and similar material.

Many institutions make a distinction between ''circulating libraries'' (where materials are expected and intended to be loaned to patrons, institutions, or other libraries) and ''collecting libraries'' (where the materials are selected on a basis of their natures or subject matter). Many modern libraries are a mixture of both, as they contain a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is often more specialized, as well as restricted to the library premises. 

==Public libraries==
[[File:Wik 24 police, biblioteka.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Public Library of [[Police County]] in [[Police, Poland|Police]], a town in [[Pomerania]], [[Poland]].]]
{{Main|Public library}}

The earliest example in England of a library to be endowed for the benefit of users who were not members of an institution such as a cathedral or college was the [[Francis Trigge Chained Library]] in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], established in 1598. The library still exists and can justifiably claim to be the forerunner of later public library systems.The beginning of the modern, free, open access libraries really got its start in the U.K. in 1847. [[Parliament]] appointed a committee, led by William Ewart, on Public Libraries to consider the necessity of establishing libraries through the nation: In 1849 their report noted the poor condition of library service, it recommended the establishment of free public libraries all over the country, and it led to the Public Libraries Act in 1850, which allowed all cities with populations exceeding 10,000 to levy taxes for the support of public libraries. Another important act was the 1870 Public School Law, which increased literacy, thereby the demand for libraries, so by 1877, more than 75 cities had established free libraries, and by 1900 the number had reached 300.<ref>{{cite book|title=The History of Libraries in the Western World|author=Harris, Michael H.|year=1984|city=London|publisher=Scarecrow Press}}</ref> This finally marks the start of the public library as we know it. And these acts led to similar laws in other countries, most notably the U.S.

1876 is a well known year in the history of librarianship in the United States.  The [[American Library Association]] was formed, as well as ''The American Library Journal'', [[Melvil Dewey]] published his decimal based system of classification, and the United States Bureau of Education published its report, "Public libraries in the United States of America; their history, condition, and management."  During the post-Civil War years, there was a rise in the establishment of public libraries, a movement led chiefly by newly formed [[women's club]]s.  They contributed their own collections of books, conducted lengthy fundraising campaigns for buildings, and lobbied within their communities for financial support for libraries, as well as with legislatures and the [[Carnegie Library]] Endowment founded in the 20th century.<ref>Paula D. Watson, <U+201C>Founding Mothers:  The Contribution of Women<U+2019>s Organizations to Public Library Development in the United States<U+201D>, ''Library Quarterly'', Vol. 64, Issue 3, 1994, p.236</ref>  They led the establishment of 75-80 percent of the libraries in communities across the country.<ref>Teva Scheer, <U+201C>The <U+201C>Praxis<U+201D> Side of the Equation: Club Women and American Public Administration<U+201D>, ''Administrative Theory & Praxis'', Vol. 24, Issue 3, 2002, p.525</ref>  The American Library Association continues to play a major role in libraries to this day, and Dewey's classification system, although under heavy criticism of late, still remains the prevailing method of classifing used in the United States. 

As the number of books in libraries increased, so did the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting, giving birth to the ''stack system'', which involved keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room.  This arrangement arose in the 19th century.  Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty).  The introduction of [[Electric light|electrical lighting]] had a huge impact on how the library [[lighting in libraries|operated]].  The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks.  As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space. 

[[Library 2.0]], a term coined in 2005, is the library's response to the challenge of Google and an attempt to meet the changing needs of users by using [[web 2.0]] technology.  Some of the aspects of Library 2.0 include, commenting, tagging, bookmarking, discussions, using social software, plug-ins, and widgets.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cohen, L.B.|title=A Manifesto for our time|year=2007|journalol=American Libraries|vume=38|pages=47<U+2013>9}}</ref> Inspired by web 2.0, it is an attempt to make the library a more user-driven institution.

Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their budget cut by state legislature.  Funding has dwindled so bad that some smaller public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.  While most donations made to public libraries are from private benefactors, they still receive very little in the way of state funding.  One of the more recent efforts that has been made to aid public libraries is the [http://www.attorney.org Attorney].org Save-A-Library campaign in which they will profile public libraries from around the country in hopes of raising donations.

Libraries have materials arranged in a specified order according to a [[library classification]] system, so that items may be located quickly and collections may be browsed efficiently. Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored.  These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public. Others require patrons to submit a "stack request," which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks.

Larger libraries are often broken down into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional [[librarian]]s. 
* Circulation - Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.
* Collection Development - Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.
* Reference - Staffs a [[reference desk]] answering user questions (using structured [[reference interview]]s), instructing users, and developing library programming. Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are [[children's literature]], [[young adult literature]], and [[genealogy]] materials.
* Technical Services - Works behind the scenes cataloguing and processing new materials and deaccessioning weeded materials.
* Stacks Maintenance - Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services.  Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.
===Management===
Basic tasks in [[library management]] include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), [[library classification]] of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems. More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming).
===Standardization===

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has published several standards regarding the management of libraries through its Technical Committee 46 (TC46<ref>http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48750</ref>), which is focused on "libraries, documentation and information centres, publishing, archives, records management, museum documentation, indexing and abstracting services, and information science". The following is a partial list of some of them:<ref>http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=48750</ref>

==Library use==
[[File:TTUSWlibrary.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Texas Tech University#Campus|Vietnam Center and Archive]], which contains the largest collection of Vietnam War-related holdings outside the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], catalogs much of its material on the Internet.]]
Patrons may not know how to fully use the library's resources. This can be due to some individuals' unease in approaching a staff member.  Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use.  An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness.  In United States [[public library|public libraries]], beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the [[library instruction]] movement, which advocated library user education. One of the early leaders was [[John Cotton Dana]]. The basic form of library instruction is generally known as [[information literacy]].

Libraries inform their users of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information.  Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card [[library catalog|catalog]] <U+2014> a cabinet containing many drawers filled with [[index card]]s that identified books and other materials.  In a large library, the card catalog often filled a large room.  The emergence of the [[Internet]], however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalog databases (often referred to as "webcats" or as [[online public access catalog]]s, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access.  This style of catalog maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as [[digital library|digital libraries]] and [[distributed library|distributed libraries]], as well as older libraries that have been retrofitted.  Electronic catalog databases are criticized by some who believe that the old card catalog system was both easier to navigate and allowed retention of information, by writing directly on the cards, that is lost in the electronic systems.  This argument is analogous to the debate over paper books and [[e-book]]s.  While libraries have been accused of precipitously throwing out valuable information in card catalogs, most modern ones have nonetheless made the move to electronic catalog databases.  Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing the resources across a series of shelves.  Once a user has located a resource within the catalog, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically; a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems or RFID tagging.

[[Finland]] has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world.  Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.<ref>[http://www.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=26046 The humble Number One: Finland <U+2014> Virtual Finland<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In the U.S., public library users have borrowed roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978.  From 1978 to 2004, book circulation per user declined approximately 50%.  The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline.<ref>[http://galbithink.org/libraries/circulation.htm Statistics on Book Circulation Per User of U.S. Public Libraries Since 1856<!-- Bot generated title -->] from galbithink.org</ref>

===Shift to digital libraries===

In the past couple of years, more and more people are using the Internet to gather and retrieve data.  The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the average person's use of physical libraries.  Between 2002 and 2004, the average American academic library saw its overall number of transactions decline approximately 2.2%.<ref>Applegate, Rachel. "Whose Decline? Which Academic Libraries are "Deserted" in Terms of Reference Transactions?" Reference & User Services Quarterly 2nd ser. 48 (2008): 176-89. Print.</ref> Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away.  For example, The University of California Library System saw a 54% decline in circulation between 1991 to 2001 of 8,377,000 books to 3,832,000.<ref>University of California Library Statistics 1990<U+2013>91, University-wide Library Planning, University of California Office of the President (July 1991): 12; University of California Library Statistics July 2001, 7, http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/00-01.pdf (accessed July 17, 2005); University of California Library Statistics July 2004, 7, http://www.slp.ucop.edu/stats/03-04.pdf (accessed July 17, 2005).</ref>

These facts might be a consequence of the increased availability of e-resources.  In 1999-2000, 105 ARL university libraries spent almost $100 million on electronic resources, which is an increase of nearly $23 million from the previous year.<ref>"ARL Libraries Spend Nearly $100 Million on Electronic Resources," ARL Bimonthly Report 219, Association of Research Libraries (December 2001), http://www.arl.org/newsltr/219/eresources.html (accessed July 17, 2005).</ref> A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8 million in revenue.<ref>Striphas, Ted. The Late Age of Print: Everday Book Culture From Consumerism to Control. New York City: Columbia UP, 2009. Print.</ref>  Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in Cushing Academy<U+2019>s decision to dispense with its library of printed books <U+2014> more than 20,000 volumes in all <U+2014> and switch over entirely to digital media resources.<ref>Nash, Richard. "Books: "An Outdated Technology?" Weblog post. The Late Age of Print. 4 Sept. 2009. Web. 19 Nov. 2009. <http://www.thelateageofprint.org/2009/09/04/books-outdated-technology/></ref>

One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities. There have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library.  As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet, their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased. There is no doubt that finding information by simply searching the Internet is much easier and faster than reading an entire book. In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them then going to the library. Also, 75% of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet.  While the retrieving information from the Internet may be efficient and time saving than visiting a traditional library, research has shown that undergraduates are most likely searching only .03% of the entire web.<ref>Troll, Denise A. "How and Why are Libraries Changing?" Digital Library Federation. Library Information Technology- Carnegie Melon, 9 Jan. 2001. Web. 29 Nov. 2009. <http://www.diglib.org/use/whitepaper.htm></ref> The information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library.
