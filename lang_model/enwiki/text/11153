[[Image:York Minster close.jpg|thumbnail|right|220px|Historically, city status in England and Wales was associated with the presence of a [[cathedral]], such as [[York Minster]].]]

'''City status in the [[United Kingdom]]''' is granted by the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] to a select group of communities. The status does not apply automatically on the basis of any particular criteria, although in [[England and Wales]] it was traditionally given to towns with [[List of Church of England dioceses|diocesan cathedrals]]. This association between having a cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when [[Henry VIII]] founded dioceses (and therefore cathedrals) in six English towns and also granted them all city status by issuing [[letters patent]].

== History ==
Until the 16th century, a town was recognised as a city by the English Crown if it had a [[List of Church of England dioceses|diocesan cathedral]] within its limits. This means some cities today are very small, because they were unaffected by population growth during the [[industrial revolution]] <U+2014> notably [[Wells]] (population about 10,000)  and [[St David's]] (population about 2,000) (see [[Smallest cities in the United Kingdom]]).  After the sixteenth century, no new dioceses (and no new cities) were created until the nineteenth century, but the practice was revived with the creation of the diocese of [[Ripon]] in 1836. A string of new dioceses and cities followed. This process was changed in 1888 to allow [[Birmingham]] and other large settlements that did not have cathedrals to become cities (Birmingham's parish church later became a cathedral).

The presence of a cathedral in a [[Scotland|Scottish]] town before the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] led often, but not universally, to its recognition as a city. [[Dornoch]], for instance, has never generally been called a city despite having had a pre-Reformation cathedral. The status of [[royal burgh]] was, in terms of privileges, more relevant in Scotland than the status of city. After the Reformation, city status crystallized and no changes were made until the nineteenth century.

City status in Ireland tended historically to be granted by royal charter. There are many towns in Ireland with [[Church of Ireland]] cathedrals which have never been called cities. In spite of this, the seat of the [[Primate of All Ireland]], [[Armagh]], was considered a city (despite its never having been granted a charter) until this status was lost in a local government reorganization in the nineteenth century. The only historic city with a charter in present-day Northern Ireland is [[Derry]], which was renamed "Londonderry" by its city charter.

== City status conferment ==
[[City]] status is conferred by [[letters patent]] and not by a royal charter (except historically in Ireland) but there are some cities in England and Wales that predate the historical monarchy, and have been regarded as cities since "[[time immemorial]]".

The holding of city status brings no especial benefits other than the right to be called a city.  All cities have to be re-issued with letters patent reconfirming city status following local government re-organisation where the original city has been abolished. This process was followed by a number of cities since 1974, and [[York]] and [[Hereford]]'s status was confirmed in both 1974 and again in the 1990s. Failure to do so leads to the loss of city status as happened at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in 1998 (see below), and also previously in [[St. David's]] and [[Armagh]], although both of these latter have regained city status since losing it. All three of these had been cities since time immemorial before the loss of city status.

Charters originated as [[charters of incorporation]], allowing a town to become an incorporated [[borough]], or to hold [[market]]s.  Some of these charters recognised officially that the town involved was a city.  Apart from that recognition, it became accepted that such a charter could make a town into a city.  The earliest examples of these are [[Hereford]] and [[Worcester, England|Worcester]], both of which date their city status to 1189.

The formal definition of a city has been disputed, in particular by inhabitants of towns that  have been regarded as cities in the past but are not generally considered cities today.  Additionally, although the Crown clearly has the right to bestow 'official' city status, some have doubted the right of the Crown to define the word "city" in the United Kingdom.  In informal usage, "city" can be used for large towns or conurbations that are not formally cities.  The best-known example of this is [[London]], which contains two cities (the '''[[City of London]]''', and the '''[[City of Westminster]]''') but is not itself a city.

== Officially-designated cities ==
There are currently 66 officially-designated cities in the UK, of which eight have been created since 2000 in competitions to celebrate the new [[3rd millennium|millennium]] and Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]'s [[Golden Jubilee]]. The designation is highly sought after, with over 40 communities submitting bids at recent competitions.

== Modern practice of granting city status  ==
Towns that became seats of bishoprics in the twentieth century, such as [[Chelmsford]], [[Guildford]], and [[Blackburn]], were not automatically granted city status. However, well into the twentieth century it was often assumed that the presence of a cathedral was sufficient to elevate a town to city status, and that for cathedral cities the city charters were recognising its city status rather than granting it.  On this basis, the [[1911 Encyclopedia Britannica]] said that [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] (diocese established 1884) and [[St Asaph]] (an historic diocese) are cities.  These towns were never granted letters patent recognising this by the Crown, and so when the letters patent became the important criterion they were no longer generally considered cities.

In 1911 an application for city status by [[Portsmouth]] was refused. Explaining the [[Home Secretary]]'s reason for not recommending the King to approve the petition, the [[Lord Advocate]] stated:

<blockquote>..during the reign of his late Majesty it was found necessary, in order to maintain the value of the distinction, to lay down a rule as to the minimum population which should ordinarily, in connexion with other considerations, be regarded as qualifying a borough for that higher status.<ref>''House of Commons - Status of Portsmouth'', The Times, June 21, 1911</ref></blockquote>

In 1927 a [[Local Government (County Boroughs and Adjustments) Act 1926|Royal Commission on Local Government]] was examining local authority areas and functions in England and Wales. The question arose as to which towns were entitled to be called cities, and the chairman, the [[Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow|Earl of Onslow]], wrote to the [[Home Office]] to seek clarification. The Home Office replied with a memorandum which read:

<blockquote>The title of a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction. It has no connexion with the status of the borough in respect of local government and confers no powers or privileges. At the present time and for several centuries past the title has been obtained only by an express grant from the Sovereign effected by letters patent; but a certain number of cities possess the title by very ancient prescriptive right. There is no necessary connexion between the title of a city and the seat of a bishopric, and the creation of a new see neither constitutes the town concerned a city nor gives it any claim to the grant of letters patent creating it a city.<br />
<br />
If a town wishes to obtain the title of a city the proper method of procedure is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and in exceptional circumstances that the title is given.<ref>''Functions of local authorities. Memorandum from Health Ministry'', The Times, 17 June, 1927</ref></blockquote>

A town can now apply for city status by submitting an application to the [[Lord Chancellor]], who makes recommendations to the sovereign. Such competitions are usually held to mark special events, such as [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]]s, royal jubilees or the [[2000|Millennium]].

===Lord Mayors===
[[Image:LordMayorOxford20040228CopyrightKaihsuTai.png|thumb|right|250px|Only 28 cities have ceremonial [[Mayors in the United Kingdom|Lord Mayors]]. Patrick John Stannard (Lord Mayor of [[Oxford]]) wears the chain of that office, 2004]]
Some cities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have the further distinction of having a [[Mayors in the United Kingdom|Lord Mayor]] rather than a simple [[Mayor]] - in Scotland, the equivalent is the [[Lord Provost]].  Lord Mayors have the right to be [[style (manner of address)|styled]] "The Right Worshipful The Lord Mayor".  The Lord Mayors and Provosts of [[Belfast]], [[Cardiff]], [[City of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[City of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[City of London]], and [[York]] all have the further right to be styled "[[The Right Honourable]] the Lord Mayor" (or Provost), though they are not members of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] as this style usually indicates.  The style is associated with the office, not the person holding it, so "The Right Worshipful Joe Bloggs" would be incorrect.

There are currently 66 recognised cities (including 30 Lord Mayoralties or Lord Provostships) in the UK:  50 cities (23 Lord Mayoralties) in [[England]], five cities (two Lord Mayoralties) in [[Wales]], six cities (four Lord Provostships) in [[Scotland]] and five cities (one Lord Mayoralty) in [[Northern Ireland]].

In [[Ireland]], as a historical result of English rule, the head of local government of [[Dublin]] is also the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]]. Whilst previously retaining the formal title of [[Right Honourable]], this was repealed in 2001. In addition, there is also a [[Lord Mayor of Cork]].

===The Former City of Rochester===
[[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] was recognised as a city from 1211 to 1998. On [[April 1]] [[1974]] the city council was abolished, becoming part of the [[City of Rochester-upon-Medway|Borough of Medway]], a [[Districts of England|local government district]] in the county of [[Kent]]. However, under [[letters patent]] the former city council area was to continue to be styled the "City of Rochester" to "perpetuate the ancient name" and to recall "the long history and proud heritage of the said city".<ref>Letters Patent dated [[March 18]], [[1974]], text retrieved from [http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/ Medway Council archives website]</ref> The city was unique, as it had no council or charter trustees and no mayor or civic head. In 1979 the Borough of Medway was renamed as [[Rochester-upon-Medway]], and in 1982 further letters patent transferred the city status to the entire borough.<ref>Letters Patent dated [[January 25]], [[1982]], text retrieved from [http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/ Medway Council archives website]</ref> On [[April 1]], [[1998]], the existing local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]] were abolished and became the new [[unitary authority]] of [[Medway]].  Since it was the local government district that officially held city status under the 1982 letters patent, when it was abolished, it also ceased to be a city.  The other local government districts with city status that were abolished around this time ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[Hereford]]) had decided to appoint [[Charter Trustees]] to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty.  However, Rochester upon Medway City Council had decided not to.   Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, they discovered that Rochester was not on the [[Lord Chancellor's Office]]'s list of cities.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/england/1991827.stm BBC News - Thursday, 16 May, 2002 - Error costs Rochester city status]</ref><ref>   [http://www.medway.gov.uk/orc20030304r-5.pdf?file=10698 Medway Council - REGENERATION AND COMMUNITY OVERVIEW AND SCRUTINY COMMITTEE - DATE 4 MARCH 2003 - TITLE OF REPORT ROCHESTER CITY STATUS]</ref>

===Pretenders===
* After its unsuccessful attempt to gain city status, the [[town]] of [[Reading, Berkshire]] started using the phrase "City Centre" on its buses and car park signs. Reading's immediate urban area has in excess of 230,000 inhabitants, making it one of the 20 largest settlements in the UK and larger than many sizeable cities including [[Southampton]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Derby]].
* In its planning, the government of the day intended [[Milton Keynes]] to be a "new city" in scale, it was referred to as such in contemporary supporting papers, but was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] in 1967 as a [[New Town]]. It has used the term "City Centre" on its buses and road signs for many years, mainly to avoid confusion with the centres of its pre-existing constituent towns. 
* [[Chelmsford]]'s [[Chelmsford Cathedral|cathedral]] dates only from 1914 (although the building is much older) and does not have city status: nevertheless its local football team calls itself [[Chelmsford City F.C.]].
* [[Dunfermline]] styles itself "A Twinned City" on the signs welcoming visitors to the town: see note 10. {{fn|(10)}}
*[[Ballymena]] in [[Northern Ireland]] has been known informally as "The City of the Seven Towers" since the nineteenth century.<ref>[http://www.ballymena.gov.uk/timeline.asp Ballymena Borough Council Timeline]</ref>

==List of officially-designated cities==
The following are the officially-designated cities in the United Kingdom, as at 2004. Cities which have held such status since [[time immemorial]] are indicated with "TI" in the column headed "Year granted city status". The column headed "(Diocesan) cathedral" shows the applicable diocesan cathedrals that were the grounds for the granting of city status, ie cathedrals of the [[Church of England]] or the formerly established [[Church in Wales]], or pre-Reformation cathedrals in the [[Church of Scotland]], in the case of cities recognised prior to 1888.  Certain cities also have [[Roman Catholic]] cathedrals, but these are not listed.  As from  1888, the presence of a cathedral ceased to be a relevant factor in granting city status and all entries after this date are, therefore, marked ''not applicable''. Cities which have acquired cathedrals since 1888 are [[Birmingham]], [[Bradford]], [[Derby]], [[Leicester]], [[Newport]], [[Portsmouth]] and [[Sheffield]], while [[Llandaff Cathedral]] was included within the boundaries of the city of Cardiff in 1922.

{{fnb|(4)}} [[Bath Abbey]] and [[Westminster Abbey]] are no longer cathedrals.

{{fnb|(5)}} Coventry has had three cathedrals: the first, St Mary's from 1043 to 1539; the second, St Michael's, from 1918 to 1940, when it was destroyed by German bombardment; and its replacement, also St Michael's, built alongside the old cathedral, consecrated in 1962.

{{fnb|(6)}} Note that the [[City of London]] covers only the "square mile", and is usually just referred to as "the City". The larger conurbation of [[London|Greater London]] has no city charter, and consists of the City of London, the [[City of Westminster]] and 31 other [[London borough]]s.

{{fnb|(10)}} According to the ''Municipal Year Book, 1972'' the [[royal burgh]]s of Perth and Elgin officially enjoyed city status. The royal burghs of [[Brechin]], [[Dunfermline]] and [[Kirkwall]] had also been officially described as "cities". As all burghs were abolished in 1975, these areas are now often called "former cities". Although Brechin does not have city status, the [[community council]] formed for the area uses the title "City of Brechin and District".

{{fnb|(12)}} The Provost of Stirling is the civic head of the entire Stirling council area, although city status only extends to the town of Stirling.

{{fnb|(13)}} Armagh had previously enjoyed city status, with [[Saint Patrick's Protestant Cathedral, Armagh|St Patrick's Cathedral]] the site of the metropolitan primate of all [[Ireland]]. The city status was lost in 1840 when the city corporation was abolished. However, the successor [[urban district]] council and district council frequently used the title of city without official sanction prior to 1994.

==City councils==
The holding of city status gives a settlement no special rights other than that of calling itself a "city".  Nonetheless, this appellation carries its own prestige and consequently,  competitions for the status are hard fought.

Most cities have "city councils", which have varying powers depending upon the type of settlement. There are [[unitary authority|unitary authorities]] (including [[metropolitan borough|metropolitan]] and [[London boroughs]]) that are responsible for all local government services within their area. (The only [[London borough]] having city status is the [[City of Westminster]]). Many cities have ordinary [[Non-metropolitan district|district councils]], which share power with [[county council]]s. At the bottom end of the scale, some cities have [[civil parish]] councils, with no more power than a [[village]].

Some cities have no council at all. Where they used to have a city council but it has been abolished they may have [[Charter Trustees]], drawn from the local district council, who appoint the mayor and look after the city's traditions.

Most "cities" are not, in fact, [[city|cities]] in the traditional sense of the word (that is, a large urban area) but are [[districts of England|local government districts]] which have  city status and which often encompass large rural areas. Examples are the [[City of Canterbury]] and [[City of Wakefield]]. The largest "city" district in terms of area is the [[City of Carlisle]], which covers some 400 square miles (1040&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of mostly rural landscape in the north of England, and is larger than smaller counties such as [[Merseyside]] or [[Rutland]]. The [[City of Sheffield]] contains part of the [[Peak District National Park]]. This is however merely a curiosity and has had no impact on the general usage of the word "city" in the UK, which has unambiguously retained its urban meaning in [[British English]]. Residents of the rural parts of the "City of Carlisle" and the like might be aware of the name of their local council, but would not consider themselves to be inhabitants of a city with a small "c". 

Equally, there are some cities where the local government district is in fact smaller than the historical or natural boundaries of the city. Four examples of this are [[Manchester]] (where the traditional area associated includes areas of the neighbouring authorities of Trafford, Tameside, Oldham, Bury and the City of Salford), [[Glasgow]] (where suburban areas of the city are located in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire), [[Wolverhampton]] (areas of the neighbouring authorities of Walsall, Dudley and South Staffordshire) and most obviously, [[London]] (Greater London outside the City of London).

This contrasts with the situation in the United States, where the primary meaning of the word "city" is any area contained within [[city limits]], completely disregarding whether or not that area is recognisable as a traditional "city".  

Due to the widespread interest in information about towns and cities, and for comparisons between urban populations and with those living outside towns, the Government at each census produces a report [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/ks_ub_ad.asp Key Statistics for Urban Areas] that separates the population of the actual town or city from the population of the area controlled by the council bearing its name.

==Applications for city status==
City status grants have been used to mark special royal and other occasions.  [[Swansea]] was granted city status in 1969 to mark the investiture of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles, Duke of Cornwall]] as [[Prince of Wales]]. At the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]] in [[1977]], [[Derby]] was granted the honour. The use of formal competitions for city status is a recent practice. The first competition was held in 1992, to mark the fortieth anniversary of the Queen's reign. [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] was the winner. In 1994 two historic seats of Bishoprics <U+2014> [[St David's]] and [[Armagh]] <U+2014> were granted city status.  They had been considered cities historically, but this status had lapsed. For the city applications in 2000, held to celebrate the [[millennium]], the following towns and boroughs requested city status:

*''England'': [[Blackburn]], [[Blackpool]], [[Bolton]], [[Brighton & Hove]], [[Chelmsford]], [[Colchester]], [[Croydon]], [[Doncaster]], [[Dover]], [[Guildford]], [[Ipswich]], [[Luton]], [[Maidstone]], [[Medway]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Milton Keynes]], [[Northampton]], [[Preston]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Shrewsbury and Atcham]], [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]], [[Stockport]], [[Swindon]], [[Telford and Wrekin]], [[Warrington]], [[Wolverhampton]].
*''Scotland'': [[Ayr]], [[Inverness]], [[Paisley]], [[Stirling]].
*''Wales'': [[Aberystwyth]], [[Machynlleth]], [[Newport]], [[Newtown]], [[St Asaph]], [[Wrexham]].
*''Northern Ireland'': [[Ballymena]], [[Lisburn]].
The three winners were [[Brighton & Hove]], [[Wolverhampton]], and [[Inverness]], which were subsequently dubbed "Millennium Cities".

For the 2002 applications, held to celebrate the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee]], the entrants included all of the above towns except [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]], together with [[London Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich]] and [[Wirral (borough)|Wirral]] in England, [[Dumfries]] in Scotland and [[Carrickfergus]], [[Coleraine]], [[Craigavon]] and [[Newry]] in Northern Ireland.  There was controversy in the rest of the UK <U+2014> especially in [[Wales]] <U+2014> over the fact that two of the three winners of the 2000 competition were [[England|English]] towns, so 2002 was run as four separate competitions. The winners in Great Britain were [[Preston]] in England, [[Newport]] in Wales, and [[Stirling]] in Scotland. In [[Northern Ireland]] it was decided to award city status to two entrants: [[Lisburn]] (predominantly unionist) and [[Newry]] (predominantly nationalist) so that offence would not be caused to either community. [[Exeter]] was awarded Lord Mayoralty status in a separate application.

==Cathedral towns==
===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===

In relation to the fact that being the seat of a [[List of Church of England dioceses|Church of England diocese]] is no longer sufficient or necessary to gain city status, a number of cathedral towns exist. In Ireland, as noted above, possession of a diocesan cathedral has never (except in the anomalous case of Armagh) been sufficient to attain this status. Towns with cathedrals may nevertheless be referred to as "cities" by their inhabitants <U+2014> particularly in the case of St Asaph and Rochester.

Additionally [[Llandaff]], which is now part of the [[Cardiff|City of Cardiff]] local government district, is home to [[Llandaff Cathedral]].

The [[1911 Encyclopedia Britannica]] refers to Llandaff, Southwell and St Asaph as cities, along with [[Armagh, County Armagh|Armagh]] and [[Lisburn]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. (The latter two achieved city status formally in 1994 and 2002 respectively.)

There are four towns in Northern Ireland with Church of Ireland Cathedrals that do not have city status <U+2014> [[Clogher]], [[Downpatrick]], [[Dromore]] and [[Enniskillen]].

In total there are [http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/Cathedrals/CathedralsTable3.htm 17 English, Welsh and Northern Ireland towns] that have city status but do not have Anglican cathedrals within their borders - [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] (a former cathedral), [[Brighton & Hove]], [[Cambridge]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[City of Lancaster|Lancaster]], [[City of Leeds|Leeds]], [[Newry]], [[Nottingham]], [[Plymouth]], [[Preston]], [[Salford]], [[Southampton]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]], [[Swansea]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] (but Westminster Abbey was a cathedral briefly during the reign of Henry VIII) and [[Wolverhampton]].

===Scotland===
The [[national church]] of [[Scotland]], the [[Church of Scotland]], is [[presbyterian]] in governance with no [[bishop]]s or [[dioceses]], and thus has [[Kirk#High Kirk|high kirks]] rather than [[cathedrals]]. However the pre-[[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] dioceses do have extant cathedrals.

Perth is often called a city, the ''fair city of Perth''. Additionally, [[St. Andrews]], [[Brechin]] and [[Elgin,_Moray|Elgin]] are often referred to as cities, as they have (ruined) pre-Reformation cathedrals. In the past Elgin, Brechin and Perth were all cities.

[[Stirling]], which was awarded city status in 2002, has never had a cathedral.

==Large towns==
As noted above, in ordinary discourse, "city" can refer to any large settlement, with no fixed limit.

There are certain towns which have large urban areas, which could qualify for city status on the grounds of their population size. Some have applied for city status and had the application turned down. Northampton is one of the most populous urban districts not to be a London Borough, metropolitan borough, unitary authority or city; on this basis the council claims that it is the largest town in England.

At every census the government produces the report [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/ks_ub_ad.asp Key Statistics for Urban Areas] which shows that the following are the largest ten urban sub-areas outside London not a part of a city or having a city as a component:

* [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] <U+2014> 232,662
* [[Dudley]] <U+2014> 194,919
* [[Northampton]] <U+2014> 189,474
* [[Luton]] <U+2014> 185,543
* [[Milton Keynes]] (urban area) <U+2014> 184,506
* [[Walsall]] <U+2014> 174,994
* [[Bournemouth]] <U+2014> 167,527
* [[Southend-on-Sea]] <U+2014> 160,257
* [[Swindon]] <U+2014> 155,432
* [[Huddersfield]] - 146,234 

See [[List of English cities by population]] for further such examples in England.

It should be noted that city status is usually not granted to urban areas, but to local government areas such as civil parishes and boroughs, the boundaries, and hence populations, of which are not necessarily the same.  The [[City of Stirling]] and the [[City of Inverness]] provide counterexamples here. [[Stirling Council]]'s application for city status was specifically for the urban area of the (now former) [[Royal Burgh of Stirling]] - proposed city boundaries were included, and so not all of the [[council area]] has city status.

This leads to the oddity whereby city status can be granted to areas that are not generally regarded as towns.  Historical or "federal cities" of this type would be [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] and [[Brighton & Hove]] - in all these cases the borough was formed and then city status granted to it afterwards.

The largest local authorities to have applied for city status in the recent competitions are 

*[[London Borough of Croydon]] <U+2014> 330,587
*[[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral]] <U+2014> 312,293
*[[Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster]] <U+2014> 286,866
*[[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport]] <U+2014> 284,528
*[[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton]] <U+2014> 261,037
*[[Medway|Borough of Medway]] <U+2014> 249,488
*[[London Borough of Southwark]] <U+2014> 244,866
*[[London Borough of Greenwich]] <U+2014> 214,403
*[[Milton Keynes (borough)|Borough of Milton Keynes]] <U+2014> 207,057
*[[Northampton|Borough of Northampton]] <U+2014> 194,458
*[[Warrington|Borough of Warrington]] <U+2014> 191,084
*[[Luton|Borough of Luton]] <U+2014> 184,371
*[[Swindon (borough)|Borough of Swindon]] <U+2014> 180,051
*[[Telford & Wrekin|Borough of Telford & Wrekin]] - 161,600
