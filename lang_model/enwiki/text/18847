"'''We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again'''" is a song by Jeffrey Comanor from the album ''A Rumor In His Own Time'', which debuted in September 1976. Written by Comanor, the song describes a couple who spend a night together, one which the narrator wishes would "never end". Both the song, which [[Epic Records]] released as a single, and album failed to chart. Discovered four months later by [[Arista Records]] President [[Clive Davis]], "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" was covered by soft rock duo [[Deardorff & Joseph]] for their [[Deardorff & Joseph (album)|eponymous debut album]]. After Deardorff & Joseph disbanded, Marcia Day, who managed [[Maureen McGovern]], became the manager of Deardorff, while Susan Joseph, who managed [[England Dan & John Ford Coley]], became the manager of Joseph. Both McGovern and England Dan & John Ford Coley released covers of "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" in February 1978; while McGovern's failed to chart, Dan & Coley's spent six weeks at number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' US [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening chart]], reached number two on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Canada Adult Contemporary chart, and went to numbers nine and eleven on the magazines' respective overall charts.

==Original release==
Lyricist and composer Jeffrey Comanor recorded "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" for the album ''A Rumor In His Own Time'', which debuted in September 1976. Produced by [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]] and released on [[Epic Records]], both the album and the single failed to chart. "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" describes a couple that spends a night together, one which the narrator wishes "would never end".<ref name="Single">{{cite AV media |people=Kyle Lehning, Jeffrey Comanor, Marshall Morgan, Tom Knox, Dan Seals, and John Ford Coley |year=1978 |title=We'll Never Have To Say Goodbye Again |medium=Vinyl record |publisher=Big Tree Records }}</ref> Comanor, who wrote the song, stated that his lyrical inspiration originated from a girl he dated who owned a wooden [[KLH (company)|KLH]] radio that continued to play music quietly when he attempted to turn it off. When Comanor's next girlfriend, Molly, left the city where he lived, he remembered their last night together and how he "hated that night to end": a combination of the two memories formed the introductory lyrics of the song.<ref name="CoverBattle">{{cite journal|title=Cover Battle Erupts|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|page=3|last=Grein|first=Paul|volume=90|number=8|date=February 25, 1978|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSQEAAAAMBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Art of Songwriting|last1=Kelley|first1=Casey|last2=Hodge|first2=David|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76lKgSfX9m8C|publisher=Penguin|year=2011|isbn=978-1-101-54337-5}}</ref>

==Covers==
After its release, [[Arista Records]] President [[Clive Davis]] found the song and wanted [[Melissa Manchester]] to record a cover; instead, he gave it to [[Deardorff & Joseph]], a group that previously opened for [[Seals and Crofts]], and they recorded it for their [[Deardorff & Joseph (album)|eponymous debut album]]. Released as a single in January 1977, the song peaked at number twenty-two on the US [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening chart]] for two weeks in April 1977.<ref name="CoverBattle" /><ref name="DJUSAC">{{cite journal|title=Easy Listening|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|page=28|volume=89|number=15|date=April 16, 1977|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyMEAAAAMBAJ}}</ref>

Nineteen months after its initial debut, [[England Dan & John Ford Coley]] covered the song for the album ''[[Some Things Don't Come Easy]]''.

In February, [[Maureen McGovern]] also recorded a cover that Epic Records released as a single. After Deardorff & Joseph separated, Marcia Day, who managed McGovern, became the manager of Danny Deardorff, while Susan Joseph, who managed Dan & Coley, became the manager of Marcus Joseph. According to Day, Susan told her that "We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again" would "absolutely not" be Dan & Coley's next single, and that McGovern could release a cover; Susan, however, states that she did not know of its plans for future release.<ref name="CoverBattle" /> On March 17, 1978, McGovern promoted her song on season four of the variety [[talk show]] ''[[Dinah!]]'', which aired on [[NBC]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 124 |series=Dinah! |first1=Dinah |last1=Shore |first2=Phyllis |last2=Diller |first3=Don |last3=Meredith |first4=Maureen|last4=McGovern |season=4 |network=NBC |date=March 17, 1978}}</ref> Described by Epic as the "title song" to McGovern's newest album, the cover did not appear on her [[Maureen McGovern (album)|next album]] and the single failed to chart.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Epic Records|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|page=19|volume=90|number=7|date=February 18, 1978|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSQEAAAAMBAJ}}</ref>
