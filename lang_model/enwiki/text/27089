of the sets were sold, but by 1984 their impact was both visible and audible. One could scarcely attend a public or private religious function in Banaras that year without hearing, over the obligatory loudspeaker system, the familiar strains of Murli Manohar Svarup's orchestration and Mukesh's mellifluous chanting.</ref><ref>Lutgendorf 1991, p. 411<U+2013>412: On January 25, 1987, a new program premiered on India's government-run television network, Doordarshan... it was the first time that television was used to present a serialized adaption of a religious epic. The chosen work was the Ramayan and the major source for the screenplay was the Manas. Long before the airing of the main story concluded on July 31, 1988, the Ramayan had become the most popular program ever shown on Indian television, drawing an estimated one hundred million viewers and generating unprecedented advertising revenues. Throughout much of the country, activities came to a halt on Sunday mornings and streets and bazaars took on a deserted look, as people gathered before their own and neighbors' TV sets.... The phenomenal impact of the Ramayan serial merits closer examination than it can be given here, but it is clear that the production and the response it engendered once again dramatized the role of the epic as a principal medium not only for individual and collective religious experience but also for public discourse and social and cultural reflection.</ref>

==Transliteration and etymology==

The Sanskrit name of Tulsidas can be transliterated in two ways. Using the [[IAST]] transliteration scheme, the name is written as ''Tulas<U+012B>d<U+0101>sa'', as pronounced in Sanskrit. Using the [[Hunterian transliteration|Hunterian]] transliteration scheme, it is written as ''Tulsidas'' or ''Tuls<U+012B>d<U+0101>s'', as pronounced in [[Hindi]]. The name is a [[Sanskrit compounds|compound]] of two Sanskrit words: [[Ocimum tenuiflorum|Tulas<U+012B>]], which is an Indian variety of the [[basil]] plant considered auspicious by [[Vaishnava]]s (devotees of god [[Vishnu]] and his [[avatar]]s like Rama),<ref>{{cite book | last=Flood | first=Gavin D. | title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey, United States of America | edition=Illustrated | year=2003 | page=331 | isbn=0-631-21535-2, 9780631215356}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Simoons | first=Frederick J. | title=Plants of life, plants of death | publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press | location=Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America | year=1998 | edition=1st | pages=7<U+2013>40 | isbn=0-299-15904-3, 9780299159047}}</ref> and [[Dasa#Dasa.2C in Hinduism|D<U+0101>sa]], which means ''slave'' or ''servant'' and by extension, ''devotee''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Monier-Williams | first=Sir Monier |title = A Sanskrit-English dictionary: etymologically and philologically arranged with special reference to cognate Indo-European languages | page=477 | authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams | year=2005 | origyear = 1899 | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | location=New Delhi, India | isbn=81-208-3105-5, 9788120831056}}</ref> Tulsidas, thus means a servant of the plant Tulsi.

Tulsidas himself has given only a few facts and hints about events of his life in various works. Till late nineteenth century, the two widely known ancient sources on Tulsidas' life were the ''Bhaktamal'' composed by Nabhadas between 1583 and 1639, and a commentary on ''Bhaktamal'' titled ''Bhaktirasbodhini'' composed by Priyadas in 1712.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi">{{cite book| last=Lutgendorf | first1=Philip | year=1994 | editor1-first=Winand M. | editor1-last=Callewaert | editor2-first=Rupert | editor2-last=Snell | title=According to Tradition: Hagiographical Writing in India | publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag | isbn=3-447-03524-2, 9783447035248 | location=Wiesbaden, Germany | pages=65<U+2013>85 | chapter=The quest for the legendary Tulsid<U+0101>s}}</ref> Nabhadas was a contemporary of Tulsidas and wrote a six-line stanza on Tulsidas describing him as an incarnation of Valmiki. Priyadas' work was composed around a hundred years after the death of Tulsidas and had eleven additional stanzas, describing seven miracles or spiritual experiences from the life of Tulsidas.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/> During the 1920s, two more ancient biographies of Tulsidas were published based on old manuscripts <U+2013> the ''Mula Gosain Charit'' composed by Veni Madhav Das in 1630 and the ''Gosain Charit'' composed by Dasanidas (also known as Bhavanidas) around 1770.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/> Veni Madhav Das was a disciple and contemporary of Tulsidas and his work gave a new date for Tulsidas' birth. The work by Bhavanidas presented more narratives in greater detail as compared to the work by Priyadas. In the 1950s a fifth ancient account was published based on an old manuscript, the ''Gautam Chandrika'' composed by Krishnadatta Misra of Varanasi in 1624.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/> Krishnadatta Misra's father was a close companion of Tulsidas. The accounts published later are not considered authentic by some modern scholars, whereas some other scholars have been unwilling to dismiss them. Together, these five works form a set of traditional biographies on which modern biographies of Tulsidas are based.<ref name="lutgengorf-tulsi"/>

===Incarnation of Valmiki===

Tulsidas is believed to be a reincarnation of  [[Valmiki]].<ref name="jonesryan-tulsi"/> In the Hindu scripture ''[[Bhavishya Purana|Bhavishyottar Purana]]'', the god [[Shiva]] tells his wife [[Parvati]] how Valmiki, who got a boon from Hanuman to sing the glory of Rama in vernacular language, will incarnate in future in the [[Kali Yuga]] (the present and last [[Yuga]] or epoch within a cycle of four Yugas).<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth">Rambhadracharya 2008, p. xxv.</ref>

Nabhadas wrote in the ''Bhaktamal'' (literally, ''the Garland of Saints'') that Tulsidas was the incarnation of Valmiki in the Kali Yuga.<ref name="lutgendorf-tulsi"/><ref>Growse 1914, p. v.</ref><ref name="Prasad 2008, p. xix">Prasad 2008, p. xix.</ref><ref name="lamb-p38">Lamb 2002, p. 38</ref> The [[Ramanandi]] sect believes that it was Valmiki himself who incarnated as Tulsidas in the Kali Yuga.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/>

According to a traditional account, Hanuman went to Valmiki several times to hear him sing the Ramayana, but Valmiki turned down the request saying that Hanuman being a monkey was unworthy of hearing the epic.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/> After the victory of Rama over [[Ravana]], [[Hanuman]] went to the Himalayas to continue his worship of Rama.

===Early life===

====Birth====

Tulsidas was born on the seventh day of the bright half of the lunar Hindu month [[Shraavana]] (July<U+2013>August).<ref name="lochtefeld"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-birth">Gita Press Publisher 2007, p. 25.</ref> Although as many as seven places are mentioned as his birthplace, most scholars identify the place with [[Rajapur, Uttar Pradesh|Rajapur]] ([[Chitrakuta]]), a village on the banks of the [[Yamuna]] river in modern-day [[Uttar Pradesh]].<ref name="pandey-tulsibirth"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/><ref name="sivananda">{{cite web | url=http://www.divyajivan.org/articles/siva/tulsidas_article.htm | title=Goswami Tulsidas By Swami Sivananda | accessdate=July 12, 2011 | last=Sivananda | first=Swami | publisher=Sivananda Ashram, Ahmedabad}}</ref> His parents were Hulsi and Atmaram Dubey. Most sources identify him as a [[Saryupareen Brahmin]] of the [[Parashar]] ''[[Gotra]]'' (lineage), although some sources claim he was a [[Kanyakubja Brahmins|Kanyakubja]] or [[Sanadhya Brahmin|Sanadhya]] Brahmin.<ref name="pandey-tulsibirth"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/><ref name="sivananda"/>

There is difference of opinion among biographers regarding the year of birth of Tulsidas. Many sources rely on Veni Madhav Das' account in the ''Mula Gosain Charita'', which gives the year of Tulsidas' birth as [[Bikram Samwat|Vikrami Samvat]] 1554 (1497 CE).<ref name="ralhan-early">Ralhan 1997 pp. 187<U+2013>194.</ref> These sources include Shivlal Pathak, popular editions of Ramcharitmanas (Gita Press, Naval Kishore Press and Venkateshvar Press), Edwin Greaves, [[Hanuman Prasad Poddar]], Ramanand Sarasvati, Ayodhyanath Sharma, [[Ramchandra Shukla]], Narayandas, and [[Jagadguru R<U+0101>mabhadr<U+0101>c<U+0101>rya|Rambhadracharya]].<ref name="pandey-tulsibirth"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-birth"/> A second group of biographers led by Sant Tulsi Sahib of Hathras and [[George Abraham Grierson|Sir George Grierson]] give the year as Vikram 1589 (1532 CE).<ref name="pandey-tulsibirth"/><ref name="ralhan-early"/> These biographers include Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, Ramghulam Dwivedi, James Lochtefeld, [[Sivananda Saraswati|Swami Sivananda]] and others.<ref name="pandey-tulsibirth"/><ref name="lochtefeld"/><ref name="sivananda"/> A third small group of authors which includes [[Horace Hayman Wilson|H. H. Wilson]], Garse De Tasse and Krishnadatta Mishra gives the year as Vikram 1600 (1543 CE).<ref name="pandey-tulsibirth"/>

The year 1497 appears in most current-day biographies and in popular culture. Biographers who disagree with this year argue that it makes the life span of Tulsidas equal 126 years, which in their opinion is ''unlikely if not impossible''. In contrast, Ramchandra Shukla says that an age of 126 is not impossible for [[Mahatma]]s (''great souls'') like Tulsidas. The [[Government of India]] and provincial governments celebrated the 500th birth anniversary of Tulsidas in the year 1997 CE, according to the year of Tulsidas' birth in popular culture.<ref name="pandey-tulsibirth"/>

====Childhood====

Legend goes that Tulsidas was born after staying in the womb for twelve months, he had all thirty two teeth in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were like that of a five-year old boy, and he did not cry at the time of his birth but uttered ''Rama'' instead.<ref name="sivananda"/><ref name="shukla-early">Shukla 2002, pp. 27<U+2013>30.</ref><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early">Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. xxvi<U+2013>xxix.</ref><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early">Gita Press Publisher 2007, pp. 25<U+2013>27.</ref><ref name="tripathi-early">Tripathi 2004, pp. 47<U+2013>50.</ref> He was therefore named '''''Rambola''''' (literally, ''he who uttered Rama''), as Tulsidas himself states in '''Vinayapatrika'''.<ref  name="vp76">Poddar 1997, pp. 112<U+2013>113 (Stanza 76).</ref> As per the '''''Mula Gosain Charita''''', he was born under the ''Abhuktam<U+016B>la'' constellation, which according to [[Jyotisha]] (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly">Pandey 2008, pp. 34<U+2013>44.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bhat | first=M.

'''Chuniya''' took the child to her village of '''Haripur''' and looked after him for five and a half years after which she died.<ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/> Rambola was left to fend for himself as an impoverished orphan, and wandered from door to door begging for alms.<ref name="ralhan-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/> It is believed that the goddess Parvati assumed the form of a Brahmin woman and fed Rambola every day.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/>

====Initiation from guru and learning====

At the age of five years, Rambola was adopted by Narharidas, a Vaishnava ascetic of [[Ramananda]]'s monastic order who is believed to be the fourth disciple of Ramananda,<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/> or alternately, the disciple of Anantacharya.<ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/> Rambola was given the ''Virakta Diksha'' (Vairagi initiation) with the new name of Tulsidas.<ref name="shukla-early"/> Tulsidas narrates the dialogue that took place during the first meeting with his guru in a passage in the ''Vinayapatrika''.<ref name="ralhan-early"/><ref name="vp76"/> When he was seven years old, his [[Upanayana]] ("sacred thread ceremony")  was performed by Narharidas on the fifth day of the bright half of the month of [[Magha (month)|Magha]] (January<U+2013>February) at [[Ayodhya]], a pilgrimage-site related to Rama. Tulsidas started his learning at Ayodhya. After some time, Narharidas took him to a particular ''Varaha Kshetra'' (a holy place with temple dedicated to [[Varaha]] - the boar avatar of Vishnu), where he first narrated the Ramayana to Tulsidas.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/> Tulsidas mentions this in the Ramcharitmanas.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 80.</ref>

Most authors identify the Varaha Kshetra referred to by Tulsidas with the Varaha temple on the second entrance of the pilgrimage of [[Chitrakuta#Kamadgiri|Kamadgiri]] in Chitrakuta.<ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/> Some biographers believe this Sukarkshetra is the ''[[Soron]]'' Varaha Kshetra in modern-day [[Kanshi Ram Nagar District|Kanshi Ram Nagar]],<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/> while some others believe it to be Paska-Rajapur Varaha Kshetra in current-day [[Gonda district|Gonda]].<ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/> Tulsidas further mentions in the Ramcharitmanas that his guru repeatedly narrated the Ramayana to him, which led him to understand it somewhat.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-early"/>

Tulsidas later came to the sacred city of Varanasi and studied [[Vy<U+0101>kara<U+1E47>a|Sanskrit grammar]], four [[Veda]]s, six [[Vedanga]]s, Jyotisha and the six schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] over a period of 15<U+2013>16 years from guru Shesha Sanatana who was based at the Pancaganga Ghat in Varanasi.<ref name="shukla-early"/> Shesha Sanatana was a friend of Narharidas and a renowned scholar on literature and philosophy.<ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="tripathi-early"/><ref name="pandey-tulsiearly"/><ref name="ralhan-testament">Ralhan 1997 pp. 197<U+2013>207.</ref> After completing his studies, Tulsidas came back to his birthplace Rajapur with the permission of Shesha Sanatana.

====Marriage and renunciation====

According to the ''Mula Gosain Charita'' and some other works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the [[Jyeshta]] month (May<U+2013>June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE).<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-early"/> Ratnavali was the daughter of Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the [[Bharadwaja]] Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of [[Kaushambi district]].<ref name="shukla-early"/><ref name="pandey-marriage">Pandey 2008, pp. 44<U+2013>49.</ref><ref name="tripathi-later">Tripathi 2004, pp. 51<U+2013>55</ref> They had a son named ''Tarak'' who died as a toddler.<ref name="tripathi-later"/> Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother.

===Later life===

====Travels====
After renunciation, Tulsidas spent most of his time at Varanasi, Prayag, Ayodhya, and Chitrakuta but visited many other nearby and far-off places. He traveled across India to many places, studying different people, meeting saints and Sadhus and meditating.<ref name="ralhan-quest">Ralhan 1997, pp. 194<U+2013>197.</ref> The ''Mula Gosain Charita'' gives an account of his travels to the [[Char Dham|four pilgrimages]] of Hindus ([[Badrinath]], [[Dwarka]], [[Puri]] and [[Rameshwaram]]) and the [[Himalayas]].<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="shukla-later">Shukla 2002, pp. 30<U+2013>32.</ref> He visited the [[Lake Manasarovar|Manasarovar lake]] in current-day [[Tibet]], where tradition holds he had [[Dar<U+015B>ana|Darshan]] (sight) of [[:hi:<U+0915><U+093E><U+0915><U+092D><U+0941><U+0936><U+0941><U+0923><U+094D><U+0921><U+093F>|Kakabhushundi]],<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later">Gita Press Publisher 2007, pp. 27<U+2013>29.</ref> the crow who is one of the four narrators in the Ramcharitmanas.<ref name="lutgendorf-narrators">Lutgendorf 1991, p. 25.</ref>

====Darshan of Hanuman====
Tulsidas hints at several places in his works, that he had met face to face with Hanuman and Rama.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref>Pradas 2008, p. 878, quoting J. L. Brockington: ... for in his more personal ''Vinayapatrika'' Tulasi alludes to having visions of Rama.</ref> The detailed account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the ''Bhaktirasbodhini'' of Priyadas.<ref name="lutgendorf-darshan">Lutgendorf 1991, pp. 49<U+2013>50.</ref> According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a [[Preta]] (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon.<ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/><ref name="growse-darshan">Growse 1914, p. ix.</ref> Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/>

That evening Tulsidas noted that the first listener to arrive at his discourse was an old leper, who sat at the end of the gathering. After the Katha was over, Tulsidas quietly followed the leper to the woods. In the woods, at the spot where the Sankat Mochan Temple stands today,<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later">Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. xxix<U+2013>xxxiv.</ref> Tulsidas firmly fell at the leper's feet, shouting "I know who you are" and "You cannot escape me".<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/><ref name="growse-darshan"/> At first the leper feigned ignorance but Tulsidas did not relent. Then the leper revealed his original form of Hanuman and blessed Tulsidas. When granted a boon, Tulsidas told Hanuman he wanted to see Rama face to face. Hanuman told him to go to Chitrakuta where he would see Rama with his own eyes.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/><ref name="lutgendorf-darshan"/><ref name="growse-darshan"/>

At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas bows down to a particular Preta and asks for his grace (Ramcharitmanas, Doha 1.7). According to Rambhadracharya, this is the same Preta which led Tulsidas to Hanuman.<ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/>

====Darshan of Rama====
As per Priyadas' account, Tulsidas followed the instruction of Hanuman and started living in an Ashram at [[Chitrakuta#Ramghat|Ramghat]] in Chitrakuta. One day Tulsidas went to perform the [[Parikrama (religious practice)|Parikrama]] (circumambulation) of the [[Chitrakuta#Kamadgiri|Kamadgiri]] mountain. He saw two princes, one dark and the other fair, dressed in green robes pass by mounted on horsebacks. Tulsidas was enraptured at the sight, however he could not recognize them and took his eyes off them. Later Hanuman asked Tulsidas if he saw Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] on horses. Tulsidas was disappointed and repentful. Hanuman assured Tulsidas that he would have the sight of Rama once again the next morning.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/> Tulsidas recalls this incident in a song of the ''Gitavali'' and laments how "his eyes turned his own enemies" by staying fixed to the ground and how everything happened in a trice.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/>

On the next morning, Wednesday, the new-moon day of Magha, Vikram 1607 (1551 CE) or 1620 (1564 CE) as per some sources, Rama again appeared to Tulsidas, this time as a child. Tulsidas was making sandalwood paste when a child came and asked for a sandalwood [[Tilaka]] (a religious mark on the forehead). This time Hanuman gave a hint to Tulsidas and he had a full view of Rama. Tulsidas was so charmed that he forgot about the sandalwood. Rama took the sandalwood paste and put a Tilaka himself on his forehead and Tulsidas' forehead before disappearing.<ref name="ralhan-quest"/><ref name="shukla-later"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/><ref name="rambhadracharya-tulsi-later"/>

====Darshan of Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja====
In Vikram 1628 (1572 CE), Tulsidas left Chitrakuta for Ayodhya where he stayed during the ''Magha Mela'' (the annual fair in January). Six days after the Mela ended, he had the Darshan of the sages [[Yajnavalkya]] and [[Bharadwaja|Bharadvaja]] under a banyan tree.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-later"/> In one of the four dialogues in the Ramcharitmanas, Yajnavalkya is the speaker and Bharadvaja the listener.<ref name="lutgendorf-narrators"/> Tulsidas describes the meeting between Yajnavalkya and Bharadvaja after a Magha Mela festival in the Ramcharitmanas, it is this meeting where Yajnavalkya narrates the Ramcharitmanas to Bharadvaja.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 48<U+2013>49 (Ramcharitmanas 1.44.1<U+2013>44.6)</ref>

===Literary life===
[[File:Gosvami Tulsidas.jpg|thumb|Tulsidas composes one of his works. Statue at Manas Mandir, Chitrakuta, Satna, India.]]

Tulsidas started composing poetry in Sanskrit in Varanasi on the Prahlada Ghat. Tradition holds that all the verses that he composed during the day, would get lost in the night. This happened daily for eight days. On the eighth night, Shiva - whose famous [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] is located in Varanasi -  is believed to have ordered Tulsidas in a dream to compose poetry in the vernacular instead of Sanskrit. Tulsidas woke up and saw both Shiva and Parvati who blessed him. Shiva ordered Tulsidas to go to Ayodhya and compose poetry in Awadhi. Shiva also predicted that Tulsidas' poetry would fructify like the [[Sama Veda]].<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry">Gita Press Publisher 2007, pp. 29<U+2013>32.</ref> In the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas hints at having the Darshan of Shiva and Parvati in both dream and awakened state.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 66 (Ramcharitmanas 1.15).</ref>

====Composition of ''Ramcharitmanas''====
In the year Vikram 1631 (1575 CE), Tulsidas started composing the Ramcharitmanas in Ayodhya on Tuesday, [[Ramnavami]] day (ninth day of the bright half of the [[Chaitra]] month, which is the birthday of Rama). Tulsidas himself attests this date in the Ramcharitmanas.<ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 38<U+2013>39: <U+0938><U+0902><U+092C><U+0924> <U+0938><U+094B><U+0930><U+0939> <U+0938><U+0948> <U+090F><U+0915><U+0924><U+0940><U+0938><U+093E><U+0964> <U+0915><U+0930><U+0909><U+0901> <U+0915><U+0925><U+093E> <U+0939><U+0930><U+093F> <U+092A><U+0926> <U+0927><U+0930><U+093F> <U+0936><U+0940><U+0938><U+093E><U+0965> <U+0928><U+094C><U+092E><U+0940> <U+092D><U+094C><U+092E> <U+092C><U+093E><U+0930> <U+092E><U+0927><U+0941> <U+092E><U+093E><U+0938><U+093E><U+0964> <U+0905><U+0935><U+0927><U+092A><U+0941><U+0930><U+0940> <U+092F><U+0939> <U+091A><U+0930><U+093F><U+0924> <U+092A><U+094D><U+0930><U+0915><U+093E><U+0938><U+093E><U+0965> <U+091C><U+0947><U+0939><U+093F> <U+0926><U+093F><U+0928> <U+0930><U+093E><U+092E> <U+091C><U+0928><U+092E> <U+0936><U+094D><U+0930><U+0941><U+0924><U+093F> <U+0917><U+093E><U+0935><U+0939><U+093F><U+0902><U+0964> <U+0924><U+0940><U+0930><U+0925> <U+0938><U+0915><U+0932> <U+0907><U+0939><U+093E><U+0901> <U+091A><U+0932><U+093F> <U+0906><U+0935><U+0939><U+093F><U+0902><U+0965> (Ramcharitmanas, 1.34.4<U+2013>1.34.6)</ref> He composed the epic over two years, seven months and twenty-six days, and completed the work in Vikram 1633 (1577 CE) on the [[Vivaha Panchami]] day (fifth day of the bright half of the [[Agrahayana|Margashirsha]] month, which commenrates the wedding of Rama and his wife [[Sita]]).<ref name="tripathi-later"/><ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/>

Tulsidas came to Varanasi and recited the Ramcharitmanas to Shiva (Vishwanath) and Parvati ([[Annapoorna devi|Annapurna]]) at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. A popular legend goes that the Brahmins of Varanasi, who were critical of Tulsidas for having rendered the Sanskrit Ramayana in the vernacular, decided to test the worth of the work. A manuscript of the Ramcharitmanas was kept at the bottom of pile of Sanskrit scriptures in the sanctum sanctorum of the Vishvanath temple in the night, and the doors of the sanctum sanctorum were locked. In the morning when the doors were opened, the Ramcharitmanas was found at the top of the pile. The words ''Satyam Shivam Sundaram'' (Sanskrit: <U+0938><U+0924><U+094D><U+092F><U+0902> <U+0936><U+093F><U+0935><U+0902> <U+0938><U+0941><U+0928><U+094D><U+0926><U+0930><U+092E><U+094D>, literally "truth, auspiciousness, beauty") were inscribed on the manuscript with the signature of Shiva. The words were also heard by the people present.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/><ref>Lutgendorf 1991, pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref><ref>Lamb 2002, p. 39</ref>

Per traditional accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi were still not satisfied, and sent two thieves to steal the manuscript.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/><ref name="macfie-theft">Macfie 2004, pp. xxiii<U+2013>xxiv.</ref> The thieves tried to break into the Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> The thieves had a change of heart and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were.<ref name="macfie-theft"/> Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend [[Todar Mal|Rai Todar Mal]], the finance minister of [[Akbar]], and donated all his money.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.<ref name="macfie-theft"/>

====Last compositions====
Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was afflicted by acute pain all over his body, especially in his arms. He then composed the ''Hanuman Bahuk'', where he describes his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas.<ref name="pandey-tulsilater">Pandey 2008, pp. 51<U+2013>58.</ref> He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also afflicted by ''Bartod'' boils (Hindi: <U+092C><U+0930><U+0924><U+094B><U+0921><U+093C>, furuncles caused by pulling out of the hair), which may have been the cause of his death.<ref name="pandey-tulsilater"/>

The [[Vinaya Patrika|Vinaypatrika]] is considered as the last compositions of Tulsidas, believed to be written when Kali Yuga started troubling him.<ref name="gp-rcm-tulsi-poetry"/> In this work of 279 stanzas, he beseeches Rama to give him Bhakti ("devotion"), and to accept his petition. Tulsidas attests in the last stanza of ''Vinaypatrika'' that Rama himself signed the manuscript of the work.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 341<U+2013>342 (Stanza 279): <U+092E><U+0941><U+0926><U+093F><U+0924> <U+092E><U+093E><U+0925> <U+0928><U+093E><U+0935><U+0924> <U+092C><U+0928><U+0940> <U+0924><U+0941><U+0932><U+0938><U+0940> <U+0905><U+0928><U+093E><U+0925><U+0915><U+0940> <U+092A><U+0930><U+0940> <U+0930><U+0918><U+0941><U+0928><U+093E><U+0925> <U+0939><U+093E><U+0925> <U+0938><U+0939><U+0940> <U+0939><U+0948> (Tulsidas bows his head with elation, the orphan has been redeemed, for the signature of Rama's hand has been made [on the Vinaypatrika]).</ref> The 45th stanza of the Vinaypatrika is sung as the evening [[Aarti]] by many Hindus.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 64<U+2013>65.</ref>

===Death===

Several manuscripts of the Ramcharitmanas are claimed to have been written down by Tulsidas himself. Grierson wrote in the late nineteenth century, two copies of the epic were said to have existed in the poet's own handwriting. One manuscript was kept at Rajapur, of which only the ''Ayodhyakand'' is left now, which bears marks of water. A legend goes that the manuscript was stolen and thrown into Yamuna river when the thief was being pursued, and only the second book of the epic could be rescued.<ref name="prasad-sgg">Prasad 2008, p. 850, quoting George Grierson.</ref> Grierson wrote that the other copy was at Malihabad in [[Lucknow]] district, of which only one leaf was missing.<ref name="prasad-sgg"/> Another manuscript of the ''Ayodhyakanda'' claimed to be in the poet's own hand exists at Soron in Etah district, one of the places claimed to be Tulsidas' birthplace.  One manuscript of ''Balakanda'', dated Samvat 1661, nineteen years before the poet's death, claimed to be corrected by Tulsidas, is at Ayodhya. Some other ancient manuscripts are found in Varanasi, including one in possession of the Maharaja of Benares that was written in Vikram 1704 (1647), twenty-four years after the death of Tulsidas.<ref name="prasad-sgg"/>

<!-- Why is this needed if it is yet unpublished? Gita Press has published all of them.
The entire collection of compositions by Tulsi Das, consisting of 13 books, has been translated into English (as poems) by [[Binda Prasad Khattri]] (1898-1985). The work is however, yet unpublished.

===Nirguna and Saguna Brahman===

[[File:Ramcharitmanas Verses - II.jpg|thumb|right|Verses from Ramcharitmanas equating the Saguna Brahman and Nirguna Brahman, at the entrance of a temple in [[Bhopal]].|250px]]
As per Tulsidas, the [[Nirguna Brahman]] (quality-less impersonal God) and [[Saguna Brahman]] (personal God with qualities) are one and the same. It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this <U+2013> the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow <U+2013> both of which have a form.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 84<U+2013>85.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 149 (Ramcharitmanas 1.116.1<U+2013>1.116.3): <U+0938><U+0917><U+0941><U+0928><U+0939><U+093F> <U+0905><U+0917><U+0941><U+0928><U+0939><U+093F> <U+0928><U+0939><U+093F><U+0902> <U+0915><U+091B><U+0941> <U+092D><U+0947><U+0926><U+093E><U+0964> <U+0917><U+093E><U+0935><U+0939><U+093F><U+0902> <U+092E><U+0941><U+0928><U+093F> <U+092A><U+0941><U+0930><U+093E><U+0928> <U+092C><U+0941><U+0927> <U+092C><U+0947><U+0926><U+093E><U+0965> <U+0905><U+0917><U+0941><U+0928> <U+0905><U+0930><U+0942><U+092A> <U+0905><U+0932><U+0916> <U+0906><U+091C> <U+091C><U+094B><U+0908><U+0964> <U+092D><U+0917><U+0924> <U+092A><U+094D><U+0930><U+0947><U+092E> <U+092C><U+0936> <U+0938><U+0917><U+0941><U+0928> <U+0938><U+094B> <U+0939><U+094B><U+0908><U+0965> <U+091C><U+094B> <U+0917><U+0941><U+0928> <U+0930><U+0939><U+093F><U+0924> <U+0938><U+0917><U+0941><U+0928> <U+0938><U+094B><U+0907> <U+0915><U+0948><U+0938><U+0947><U+0964> <U+091C><U+0932> <U+0939><U+093F><U+092E> <U+0909><U+092A><U+0932> <U+092C><U+093F><U+0932><U+0917> <U+0928><U+0939><U+093F><U+0902> <U+091C><U+0948><U+0938><U+0947><U+0965>.</ref> Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake <U+2013> the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 520<U+2013>521.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 647 (Ramcharitmanas 4.17.2): <U+092B><U+0942><U+0932><U+0947> <U+0915><U+092E><U+0932> <U+0938><U+094B><U+0939> <U+0938><U+0930> <U+0915><U+0948><U+0938><U+0947><U+0964> <U+0928><U+093F><U+0930><U+094D><U+0917><U+0941><U+0928> <U+092C><U+094D><U+0930><U+0939><U+094D><U+092E> <U+0938><U+0917><U+0941><U+0928> <U+092D><U+090F> <U+091C><U+0948><U+0938><U+0947><U+0965>.</ref> In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasha about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasha adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism).

===Rama as Brahman===
At several places in Tulsidas' works, Rama is seen to be the higher than Vishnu and not as an [[avatar]] of Vishnu, which is the general portrayal of Rama.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 875, quoting Frank Whaling: Theologically, Tulasidasa continues the process, begun in the ''Adhyatma [Ramayana]'', whereby Rama is seen to be higher than Vishnu. We see this in Tulasi's stress upon the Name of Rama; we see it also in Tulasi's assertions that Rama is Brahman whereas Vishnu is not. ... Tulasi uses the word Rama in the sense of God, ... The usual comparison has been between Rama and Christ, but perhaps an apter comparison is between Rama and the Christian God, for in terms of Ramology, Rama is equivalent to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Bakker| first=Freek L. | isbn=90-04-16861-3, 9789004168619 | title = The challenge of the silver screen: an analysis of the cinematic portraits of Jesus, Rama, Buddha and Muhammad: Volume 1 of Studies in religion and the arts | edition=Illustrated | location=Leiden, The Netherlands | year=2009 | publisher=BRILL | page=123 | quote=It is clear that Rama transcends Vishnu in the Manas.

===Vedanta, World and Maya===

In the Sundarkand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that Rama is knowable by [[Vedanta]].<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 533.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 660</ref> 

As per Tulsidas, Rama is the efficient and material cause (''Nimitta'' and ''Upadana'') of the world, which is real since Rama is real.<ref name="singh-jagat">Singh 2008, pp. 272<U+2013>273.</ref> In several verses of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas says that the animate and inanimate world is a manifestation of Rama, and the universe is the cosmic form of Rama. Authors interpret these verses to mean that the world is real according to Tulsidas, in keeping with the [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosophy of [[Ramanuja]].<ref>Shukla 2002, pp. 50<U+2013>51.</ref><ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 510, 588<U+2013>589.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 632<U+2013>633, 728<U+2013>729.</ref> However, at some places in the Ramcharitmanas and Kavitavali, Tulsidas compares the world to a night or a dream and says it is ''Mithya'' (false or unreal). Some commentators interpret these verses to mean that in Tulsidas' opinion the world is unreal as per the ''Vivartavada'' doctrine of [[Adi Shankara]], while some others interpret them to mean that the world is transient yet real as per the ''Satkhyativada'' doctrine of Ramananda.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 82, 307, 500.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, pp. 101, 377<U+2013>378, 621.</ref> Uday Bhanu Singh concludes that in Tulsidas' view, the world is essentially the form of Rama and appears to be different from Rama due to [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. Its visible form is transient, which is what Tulsidas means by ''Mithya''.<ref name="singh-jagat"/> In the Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas says that the world in itself is neither true (''Satya''), nor false (''Asatya''), nor both true and false together (''Satyasatya'') <U+2013> one who casts aside all these three illusions, knows oneself. This has been interpreted to mean that as per Tulsidas, the entire world is a [[Lila (Hinduism)|Lila]] of Rama.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 144<U+2013>145 (Stanza 111).</ref> At the beginning of the Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas performs ''Samasti Vandana'' (obeisance to all beings) in which he bows down to the world also, saying it is "pervaded by" or "born out of" Sita and Rama.<ref>Lutgendorf 1991, p. xi.</ref><ref>Prasad 2008, p. 8.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 12.</ref> As per some verses in Ramcharitmanas and Vinaypatrika, when a [[Jiva]] (living being) knows the Self, ''Maya'' and  Rama, it sees the world as being pervaded by Rama.<ref name="singh-jagat"/> 

In the Balkand episode of the marriage of the princes of Ayodhya with the princesses of Mithila, Tulsidas presents a metaphor in which the four brides are compared with the four states of consciousness <U+2013> the waking state (''Jagrat''), sleep with dreams (''Swapna''), dreamless sleep (''Sushupti'') and the fourth self-conscious state ([[Turiya]]). The four grooms are compared with the presiding divinity (''Vibhu'') of the four states <U+2013> ''Vishva'', ''Taijasa'', ''Prajna'' and ''Brahman''. Tulsidas says as the four states of consciousness with their presiding divinities reside in the mind of a Jiva, so the four brides with their grooms are resplendent in the same pavilion.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 221.</ref><ref>Rambhadracharya 2008, p. 275.</ref>

Tulsidas identifies Maya with Sita, the inseparable energy of Rama which takes avatar along with Rama.<ref name="singh-maya">Singh 2008, p. 272.</ref> In his view, Maya is of two types <U+2013> Vidya and [[Avidya]]. ''Vidya Maya'' is the cause of creation and the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya is the cause of illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is under the control of Maya.<ref name="singh-maya"/> Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with [[Vaishnava]] teachers of Vedanta.<ref name="singh-maya"/>

===Views on other Hindu deities===

As per Tulsidas, there is no incompatibility between devotion to Rama and attachment to Shiva.<ref>Prasad 2008, p. 579 (Ramcharitmanas 6.2): Those who are devoted to Shankara and are hostile to me, and those who are opposed to Shiva but would fain be my servants, shall have their abode in the deepest hell for a full aeon.</ref><ref>Lutgendorf 1991, p. 48: I have noted that a major theme of Tulsi's epic is the compatibility of the worship of Ram/Vishnu with that of Shiva.</ref> Tulsidas equates the Guru as an incarnation of Shiva,<ref name="Prasad 2008, p. 1">Prasad 2008, p. 1</ref> and a considerable part of the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas is devoted to the narrative of Shiva including the abandonment of Sati, the penance of Parvati, the burning of Kamadeva and the marriage of Parvati and Shiva.<ref>Prasad 2008, pp. 40<U+2013>77 (Ramcharitmanas 1.48<U+2013>1.104).</ref> In addition, Tulsidas venerates the whole Hindu pantheon. The Ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of Ganesh, Sarasvati, Parvati, Shiva, the Guru, Valmiki and Hanuman.<ref name="Prasad 2008, p. 1"/> At the beginning of the Vinayapatrika, he bows to Ganesh, Surya, Shiva, Devi, Ganga, Yamuna, Varanasi and Chitrakoot, asking them for devotion towards Rama.<ref>Poddar 1997, pp. 1<U+2013>24 (Stanzas 1<U+2013>24).</ref>

===Bhakti===

The Lord is to be approached by faith ([[bhakti]]) single minded devotion and surrender of self in perfect love, and all actions are to be purified of self-interest in contemplation of Him.  Show love to all creatures, and thou wilt be happy; for when thou lovest all things, thou lovest the Lord, for He is all in all. The soul is from the Lord, and is submitted in this life to the bondage of works ([[karma]]); Mankind, in their obstinacy, keep binding themselves in the net of actions, and though they know and hear of the bliss of those who have faith in the Lord, they do not attempt the only means of release.  The bliss to which the soul attains, by the extinction of desire, in the supreme home, is not absorption in the Lord, but union with Him in abiding individuality.  This is emancipation ([[mukti]]) from the burden of birth and rebirth, and the highest happiness. But the practical end of all his writings is to inculcate bhakti addressed to Rama as the great means of salvation and emancipation from the chain of births and deaths, a salvation which is as free and open to men of the lowest caste as to [[Brahmin]]s.

The Hindi poetess [[Mahadevi Verma]] said commenting on Tulsidas that in the turbulent Middle Ages, India got light from Tulsidas. She further went on to say that the Indian society as it exists today is an edifice built by Tulsidas, and the Rama as we know today is the Rama of Tulsidas.<ref>Pandey 2008, p. 11: <U+0907><U+0938> <U+0938><U+0928><U+094D><U+0926><U+0930><U+094D><U+092D> <U+092E><U+0947><U+0902> <U+0938><U+0941><U+092A><U+094D><U+0930><U+0938><U+093F><U+0926><U+094D><U+0927> <U+0915><U+0935><U+092F><U+093F><U+0924><U+094D><U+0930><U+0940> <U+092E><U+0939><U+093E><U+0926><U+0947><U+0935><U+0940> <U+0935><U+0930><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E> <U+0915><U+093E> <U+0915><U+0925><U+0928> <U+0926><U+094D><U+0930><U+0937><U+094D><U+091F><U+0935><U+094D><U+092F> <U+0939><U+0948> <U+2013> <U+0939><U+092E><U+093E><U+0930><U+093E> <U+0926><U+0947><U+0936> <U+0928><U+093F><U+0930><U+093E><U+0936><U+093E> <U+0915><U+0947> <U+0917><U+0939><U+0928> <U+0905><U+0928><U+094D><U+0927><U+0915><U+093E><U+0930> <U+092E><U+0947><U+0902> <U+0938><U+093E><U+0927><U+0915>, <U+0938><U+093E><U+0939><U+093F><U+0924><U+094D><U+092F><U+0915><U+093E><U+0930><U+094B><U+0902> <U+0938><U+0947> <U+0939><U+0940> <U+0906><U+0932><U+094B><U+0915> <U+092A><U+093E><U+0924><U+093E> <U+0930><U+0939><U+093E> <U+0939><U+0948><U+0964> <U+091C><U+092C> <U+0924><U+0932><U+0935><U+093E><U+0930><U+094B><U+0902> <U+0915><U+093E> <U+092A><U+093E><U+0928><U+0940> <U+0909><U+0924><U+0930> <U+0917><U+092F><U+093E>, <U+0936><U+0902><U+0916><U+094B><U+0902> <U+0915> <U+0918><U+094B><U+0937> <U+0935><U+093F><U+0932><U+0940><U+0928> <U+0939><U+094B> <U+0917><U+092F><U+093E>, <U+0924><U+092C> <U+092D><U+0940> <U+0924><U+0941><U+0932><U+0938><U+0940> <U+0915><U+0947> <U+0915><U+092E><U+0902><U+0921><U+0932> <U+0915><U+093E> <U+092A><U+093E><U+0928><U+0940> <U+0928><U+0939><U+0940><U+0902> <U+0938><U+0942><U+0916><U+093E> ... <U+0906><U+091C> <U+092D><U+0940> <U+091C><U+094B> <U+0938><U+092E><U+093E><U+091C> <U+0939><U+092E><U+093E><U+0930><U+0947> <U+0938><U+093E><U+092E><U+0928><U+0947> <U+0939><U+0948> <U+0935><U+0939> <U+0924><U+0941><U+0932><U+0938><U+0940><U+0926><U+093E><U+0938> <U+0915><U+093E> <U+0928><U+093F><U+0930><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E><U+0923> <U+0939><U+0948><U+0964> <U+0939><U+092E> <U+092A><U+094C><U+0930><U+093E><U+0923><U+093F><U+0915> <U+0930><U+093E><U+092E> <U+0915><U+094B> <U+0928><U+0939><U+0940><U+0902> <U+091C><U+093E><U+0928><U+0924><U+0947>, <U+0924><U+0941><U+0932><U+0938><U+0940><U+0926><U+093E><U+0938> <U+0915><U+0947> <U+0930><U+093E><U+092E> <U+0915><U+094B> <U+091C><U+093E><U+0928><U+0924><U+0947> <U+0939><U+0948><U+0902><U+0964></ref>
