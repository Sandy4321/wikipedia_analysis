"'''Marge vs. the Monorail'''" is the twelfth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]] and originally aired on January 14, 1993. The plot focuses around Springfield's purchase of  a [[monorail]] from a conman, and Marge's dislike of the purchase. It was written by [[Conan O'Brien]] and directed by [[Rich Moore]]. [[Leonard Nimoy]] [[guest star]]s as himself and [[Phil Hartman]] guest stars as [[List of one-time characters in The Simpsons#Lyle_Lanley|Lyle Lanley]].

==Plot==
After being caught dumping nuclear waste in the city park by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]], [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] is fined three million dollars. A town meeting is immediately held so that the citizens can decide what to spend the money on and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] suggests that the city use the money to fix up Main Street, which is in poor condition. The town shows enthusiasm for this idea and is about to vote for it when suddenly a sleazy silver-tongued, fast talking gentleman named [[List of one-time characters in The Simpsons#Lyle_Lanley|Lyle Lanley]] suggests that the town construct a city [[monorail]]. He leads them in a song, which convinces the town to buy the monorail.

Even though Lanley succeeds in winning over the entire town, including skeptical Lisa, Marge is unhappy with the purchase, believing that the monorail is unsafe. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement that suggests he become a monorail conductor, and Homer, claiming it to be a lifelong dream, immediately agrees. After a three week course described by Lanley as "intensive", Homer is named the monorail conductor. Still feeling uneasy about the monorail, Marge decides to visit Lyle Lanley and discovers a notebook that reveals Lanley<U+2019>s true intentions of running off with [[bags of money]] while everyone else falls victim to a faulty monorail. Marge immediately drives to [[List of fictional places on The Simpsons#North Haverbrook|North Haverbrook]], which Lanley mentioned was a previous purchaser of one of his monorails. Once she arrives, Marge discovers that the town is in ruins, and that those still living there deny that they ever had a monorail, despite the fact that the town is covered in advertisements for it. While exploring, she meets Sebastian Cobb, the man who designed Lanley's monorail. He explains that Lanley cut costs everywhere when building it, and that the entire thing is a scam.

At the maiden voyage of the monorail, the entire town has come out, including [[Leonard Nimoy]]. Lanley grabs his money and jumps in a taxi, which takes him to the airport. The monorail leaves just before Marge and Cobb arrive. At first things run smoothly, but the controls malfunction, causing the monorail to accelerate dangerously. Meanwhile, Lanley<U+2019>s flight makes a brief unscheduled stop in North Haverbrook, where Lanley is immediately recognized and beaten down by the locals. Back in Springfield, Cobb tells Homer that in order to stop the train, he needs to find an anchor. Homer grabs the giant "M" from the side of the Monorail and uses it as an anchor. Eventually, it latches onto a giant doughnut, stopping the monorail and saving its passengers.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|page=173}}</ref>

Conan O'Brien first pitched this episode at a story retreat - to Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who said the episode was a little crazy and thought he should try some other material first. Conan had previously pitched episodes where [[Lisa's Rival|Lisa had a rival]] and where [[Marge Gets a Job|Marge gets a job at the Plant and Burns falls in love with her]]; both went well. [[James L. Brooks]] "absolutely loved" this episode when Conan presented it.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Marge vs. the Monorail"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Casting===
Leonard Nimoy was not originally considered for the role as the celebrity at the maiden voyage of the monorail, as the writing staff did not think he would accept, because [[William Shatner]] had previously turned the show down. Instead, [[George Takei]] was asked to guest star as he had done the show once before. After demanding several script changes,<ref name="Reiss">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Marge vs. the Monorail"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Takei declined, saying he did not want to make fun of public transportation as he was a member of the board of directors of the [[Southern California Rapid Transit District]]. As a result, the staff went to Nimoy, who accepted.<ref name="Jean"/>

==Cultural references==
The episode starts with a tribute song to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' as Homer heads home from work and crashes his car into a [[chestnut]] tree.<ref name="bbc"/> Later, [[Leonard Nimoy]] makes a guest appearance as himself. References are made to his role in ''[[Star Trek]]'', and an allusion to his role as the host of ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]'' from 1976 to 1982. Kyle Darren, the caricature of [[Luke Perry]] star of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', appears as well.<ref name="leaving74">Mullen, p. 74</ref>

The episode is also a partial spoof of ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'', with "The Monorail Song" strongly resembling the Music Man's "Trouble" and with Lyle Lanley being a doppelganger for Harold Hill.<ref name="bbc"/> When Mr. Burns is brought into the court room, he is restrained in the same way as [[Hannibal Lecter]] in the film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.<ref name="bbc"/> Smithers and Burns make their exit from the town hall with the use of a grapple-hook in a reference to Tim Burton's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', with Burns as Vicki Vale. The commentary states that Homer's Monorail conductor uniform is based on uniforms from ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name="Moore">{{cite video | people=Moore, Rich|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Marge vs. the Monorail"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>
