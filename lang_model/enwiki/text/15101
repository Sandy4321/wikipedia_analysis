==History==
The area of [[Iowa County, Iowa]] that became known as Holbrook was settled by Irish immigrants or descendants of Irish immigrants.  Thomas Hanson, one of those settlers, brought the priest from [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]] in his lumber wagon and Mass was celebrated in his home. People from the surrounding area would gather for the Mass. The parish was established in 1843 and plans to erect a church were begun.<ref name= oldstmichaels.com >{{cite web |url=http://oldstmichaels.com/history/church/ |title=St. Michael's Church |publisher=Friends of Old St. Michael<U+2019>s |accessdate=2010-06-07 |last= |first= }}</ref>
A small frame church was built in what is now St. Michael<U+2019>s Cemetery, near the site of the present church building.  The Rev. Mathias Hannon, who came to Holbrook from Iowa City for the first time in 1853, described the church thus, "I said mass within before the floor was laid, had the beautiful snow for carpet, and a pine box for an altar in fact a place as forlorn as the stable wherein the Savior was born. There was no more than fourteen families." <ref name= oldstmichaels.com />

Bishop [[Mathias Loras]] of the[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque|Diocese of Dubuque]] assigned the Rev. Peter J. Sullivan as the first resident pastor.  He built the current church building in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style in 1867. The building is constructed of [[brick]], measures 90 by 50 feet and cost about $2,000 to build.  The pastor himself donated the paintings for the [[Stations of the Cross]], which cost $1,000.<ref name= oldstmichaels.com /> They are no longer in the church and what happened to them is unknown.

The parish became part of the Davenport Diocese when it was established in 1881.  Alterations were made to the buildings as the years continued.  The bell, which is still in the tower, was cast in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1882.    A new [[dome]] was placed on top of the bell tower during the pastorate of the Rev. Thomas King (1889<U+2013>1909). During the pastorate of the Rev. Edward Gaule (1909<U+2013>1917) a new sanctuary with new altars were added to the church. The new bell tower, the third one constructed on this site, was added at this time as well.  An addition was added on to the rectory when the Rev. John J. Moriarity (1917<U+2013>1922) was pastor.  The Rev. James M. Ryan (1922<U+2013>1927) added [[stucco]] to the exterior of the church during his pastorate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldstmichaels.com/history/pastors/ |title=Pastors of St. Michael<U+2019>s |publisher=Friends of St. Michael<U+2019>s |accessdate=2010-06-07 |last= |first= }}</ref>

In 1885 Bishop [[Henry Cosgrove]] assigned the Rev. [[James J. Davis (Catholic bishop)|James Davis]] as the pastor.  He was an Irish immigrant who came to the Dubuque Diocese shortly after his ordination in 1878.  At the time St. Joseph<U+2019>s in [[Parnell, Iowa|Parnell]] was a mission to St. Michael<U+2019>s, and Davis built both the school and church there.  He also built the front part of the present rectory in Holbrook.  Four years later he was transferred to St. Margaret<U+2019>s Cathedral in [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]].  He would be the cathedral<U+2019>s [[rector]] and direct the construction of the new [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Davenport, Iowa)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].  The people of Holbrook considered the transfer a demotion seeing as St. Margaret<U+2019>s was a smaller parish.<ref name=Schmidt>{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Madeleine M.|title=Seasons of Growth: History of the Diocese of Davenport |volume= |year=1981 |publisher=Diocese of Davenport|location=Davenport, Iowa|page=159}}</ref>  Father Davis went on to become [[coadjutor bishop]] in 1904 and then Bishop of Davenport in 1906.

As the 20th century progressed the rural population of Iowa decreased, and the Holbrook area was no different.  Toward the end of the century St. Michael<U+2019>s was clustered with other parishes in the area and served by a single priest.  Finally in the 1990s it was determined that there were no longer enough people to keep the parish open.  In a little over a century St. Michael<U+2019>s went from being <U+201C>the largest and best parish in the diocese<U+201D> <ref name=Schmidt/> to closing.  The parish buildings were sold to the Friend<U+2019>s of St. Michael<U+2019>s, who are now responsible for their upkeep.
