'''Holstein Kiel''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[List of football clubs in Germany|club]] in the city of [[Kiel]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. 

==History==
===Foundation to WW2===
Founded on October 7, [[1900]], ''1. Kieler Fussball Verein von 1900'' was an offshoot of the sports and gymnastics club ''Kieler M<U+00E4>nnerturnvereins von 1844''. The club quickly became competitive and in [[1912]] they captured the German championship with a 2:1 overtime semi-final victory over defending champions ''[[Viktoria 89 Berlin]]'', followed by a 1:0 win in the final over the previous year's champions ''[[Karlsruher FV]]''.

After [[World War I]], ''FV Kiel'' merged with another local club, ''FC Holstein'' ([[1902]]), to form the current club, ''Kieler Sportvereinigung Holstein von 1900 e.V.''. The team made regular, but unfruitful, appearances in the early rounds of the national playoffs through the 20's. In [[1930]], they played their way to another final, this time losing 4:5 to ''[[Hertha BSC Berlin]]''. The following year saw them only as far as the semi-finals.

Shortly after this, German football was re-organized into sixteen top flight divisions under the [[Third Reich]]. ''Kiel'' played in the Gauliga Nordmark and consistently delivered solid top-five finishes, but were frustrated in their pursuit of a division title. In [[1942]], the Gauliga Nordmark was broken up into the Gauliga Hamburg and Gauliga Schleswig-Holstein. No longer in the company of ''[[Hamburger SV]]'' and other strong teams from the city, ''Kiel'' immediately captured the title of the new division and defended it over the next two seasons until the end of [[World War II]] brought play to a halt across the country.

Those titles earned ''Kiel'' entry into the national playoff rounds. They made their best run in [[1943]] when they advanced as far as the semi-finals before being put out by eventual champions ''[[Dresdner SC]]''. The team captured third place by defeating ''[[First Vienna FC|FC Vienna Wien]]''. They next year they were eliminated early on, and no final was played in [[1945]].

===Postwar to present===
That would be all the glory there was for ''Holstein'' for many years. They have been primarily a tier II and III club into the present day. They captured the German amateur championship in [[1961]] and had a failed oppourtunity to make the [[Bundesliga (football)|Bundesliga]] in [[1965]] after winning the Regionalliga Nord (II). After a few seasons in Oberliga Hamburg (IV) in the late 90's they returned to Regionalliga Nord (III), narrowly missing promotion to the second Bundesliga in the 2005/06 season.
