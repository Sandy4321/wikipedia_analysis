'''Ferdinando Nicola Sacco''' (April 22, 1891-August 23, 1927) and '''Bartolomeo Vanzetti''' (June 11, 1888-August 23, 1927) were [[anarchists]] who were convicted of murdering two men during a 1920 [[armed robbery]] in [[Massachusetts]]. After a controversial trial and a series of appeals, the two [[Italian]] [[immigrants]] were executed on August 23, 1927.<ref name="Dattilio">[[#refDattilio|D'Attilio]].</ref><ref name="NYTimes1927">[[#refNYTimes1927|New York Times, 1927-08-23]]</ref>

There is highly politicized dispute over their guilt or innocence, and regardless guilt or innocence, whether or not the trials were fair.<ref name="Montgomery1960">[[#refMontgomery1960|Montgomery 1960 p. v]].</ref><ref name="Young1985">[[#refYoung1985|Young & Kaiser 1985 preface]].</ref> The dispute focuses on small details and contradictory evidence, and historians have not, as of 2010, reached consensus.

==Overview==
Sacco and Vanzetti were accused of the murders of Frederick Parmenter, a paymaster, and Alessandro Berardelli, a security guard, at the Slater-Morrill Shoe Company, on Pearl Street in [[South Braintree, Massachusetts]] during the afternoon of April 15, 1920.  Vanzetti was further charged with the theft of $15,776.51 from the company.

Police suspicions regarding the South Braintree robbery and a previous one in South Bridgewater centered on local Italian anarchists.<ref>Avrich, Paul, ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton: Princeton University Press (1996), ''Interview of Charles Poggi'', pp. 132-133</ref>  While neither Sacco nor Vanzetti had any previous criminal record, the authorities knew them as radical [[militant]]s and adherents of [[Luigi Galleani]]. Police speculated about a connection between the crimes and the recent activities of the Galleanist anarchist movement, thinking that the robberies were made to gain funds for a bombing campaign.

The two men were arrested in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]] on May 5, 1920, after appearing at a garage to pick up a car that police believed was used in the robberies.  Both had pistols on them, along with anarchist literature, and Vanzetti was carrying shotgun shells, such as those used in the holdup.

Vanzetti was tried initially for armed robbery and convicted.  Both men were then tried for the murders and convicted.  After several failed appeals, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in the [[electric chair]] on August 23, 1927.  Celestine Madeiros, who had confessed to the murders, was executed the same day.

==Background==
Sacco was a shoe-maker born in [[Torremaggiore]], [[Province of Foggia|Foggia]], who emigrated to the United States at the age of seventeen.<ref>''The New York Times'', March 5, 1922</ref> Vanzetti was a [[fishmonger]] born in [[Villafalletto]], [[Province of Cuneo|Cuneo]], who arrived in the United States at age twenty. Both men arrived in the U.S. in 1908, although they did not meet until the middle of 1917.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
  
[[Image:Sacco e Vanzetti.PNG|frame|left|Sacco and Vanzetti]]
The men were followers of [[Luigi Galleani]], an Italian anarchist who advocated revolutionary violence, including [[bombing]] and [[assassination]]. Galleani published ''Cronaca Sovversiva'' (''Subversive Chronicle''), a periodical that advocated violent revolution, and an explicit bomb-making manual called ''La Salute <U+00E8> in voi!''. At the time, Italian anarchists ranked at the top of the United States government's list of dangerous enemies.  Since 1914, they had been identified as suspects in several violent bombings and assassination attempts, including an attempted mass poisoning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Publication of ''Cronaca Sovversiva'' was suppressed in July 1918, and the government deported Galleani and eight of his closest associates on June 24, 1919.<ref name="writing.upenn.edu">[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/sacvan.html University of Pennsylvania]</ref>

Remaining Galleanists either sought to avoid arrest by becoming inactive or going underground, or remained active.  For three years, perhaps 60 Galleanists waged an intermittent campaign of violence against US politicians, judges, and other federal and local officials, especially those who had supported deportation of alien radicals. Among the dozen or more violent acts was the bombing of [[US Attorney General]] [[A. Mitchell Palmer]]'s home on June 2, 1919. In that incident, one Galleanist, Carlo Valdonoci, a former editor of ''Cronaca Sovversiva'' and an associate of Sacco and Vanzetti, was killed.  The bomb intended for Attorney General Palmer exploded in Valdonoci's hands.  Radical pamphlets entitled "Plain Words" signed "The Anarchist Fighters" were found at the scene of this and several other midnight bombings that night.<ref name="writing.upenn.edu"/>

Several Galleanist associates were suspected or interrogated about their roles in the bombing incidents. Two days before Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested, a Galleanist named [[Andrea Salsedo]] fell to his death from the [[Justice Department]]'s [[Bureau of Investigation]] offices on 15 Park Row in New York City. People speculated that Salsedo may have been pushed out the window or dropped as he was held by his ankles during interrogation, a well-known "[[third-degree]]" technique. Roberto Elia, another Galleanist under arrest, was later deposed in the inquiry. He testified that Salsedo had committed suicide for fear of betraying the others.<ref>David Felix supported this idea. David Felix, ''Protest: Sacco-Vanzetti and the Intellectuals'' (1965), 75-76, 80.</ref> Salsedo worked in the Canzani Printshop in [[Brooklyn]], where federal agents traced the "Plain Words" leaflet.

The Galleanists knew that Salsedo had been held, and reportedly beaten, for two months, which led to rumors that Salsedo and his comrade Roberto Elia had made important disclosures concerning the bomb plot of June 2. The rumors about the confessions were later confirmed by Attorney General Palmer to encourage fear.  The Galleanist plotters realized that they would have to go underground and dispose of any incriminating evidence. Sacco and Vanzetti were found to have correspondence with several Galleanists; one letter warned Sacco to destroy all mail after reading.

==Arrests==
On April 16, one day after the robbery-murders, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Federal Immigration Service]] called local police chief Michael E. Stewart to discuss Galleanist anarchist Ferruccio Coacci, whom he had arrested on their behalf two years earlier. Coacci had succeeded in postponing his deportation until April 15, 1920, the day of the Braintree holdup. The FIS asked Stewart to investigate Coacci's excuse that he had failed to report for deportation because his wife had fallen ill. Stewart sent two policemen to Coacci's house on April 16.

They found Coacci's wife in good health.  Coacci insisted on being arrested for immediate deportation. As he had an alibi for the robbery: his timecard showed he was at work on April 15, he was deported on April 18.  Suspicious, Stewart returned to the Coacci residence on April 20, where he found "Mike Boda" (an alias of [[Mario Buda]], the chief Galleanist bombmaker) renting the house. Buda volunteered that Coacci's wife had left in a hurry. Under questioning, Buda admitted owning a .32 caliber Spanish automatic pistol and possessing a diagram of a Savage automatic, such as the one used in the murders. Buda said he owned a 1914 Oakland, which was being repaired. Police thought two cars had been kept at the now empty Coacci garage, and believed a Buick and smaller car were used during the holdup. 

When Stewart discovered that Coacci had worked for both the plants that had been robbed, he returned with the Bridgewater police, but Buda had disappeared, along with his possessions and furniture.
[[Image:Save Sacco and Vanzetti.jpg|thumb|300px|Protest for Sacco and Vanzetti in London, 1921]]
The police had instructed the Johnson garage, where the impounded cars were held, to notify them when the owners came to collect the 1914 Oakland. On May 5, 1920 Buda arrived at the garage with three other men, later identified as Sacco, Vanzetti and Riccardo Orciani. Police were alerted but the men sensed a trap and fled. Buda escaped on a motorcycle with Orciani.  He later resurfaced in Italy in 1928. Tracked onto a streetcar, Sacco and Vanzetti were soon arrested. Vanzetti claimed that the revolver he was carrying was for protection. To avoid deportation, the pair denied being allied with anarchists. 

Following the indictment of Sacco and Vanzetti, anarchists in other countries began violent retaliation. In 1921, a booby trap bomb mailed to the American [[ambassador]] in Paris exploded, wounding his valet.<ref>''New York Times''. "Bomb For Herrick Wounds His Valet In His Paris Home." October 19, 1921. Years later, the sender of the bomb was revealed to be May Picqueray (1893-1983), a militant anarchist and editor of ''Le R<U+00E9>fractaire''.</ref> Other bombs sent to American embassies were defused. In 1926, a bomb destroyed the house of Samuel Johnson, the brother of the Simon Johnson who had called police the night of Sacco and Vanzetti's arrest.

==First trial==
Only Vanzetti was tried for the attempted robbery in South Bridgewater. Others arrested produced persuasive alibis, like Sacco's time-card proving he was at work. The presiding judge was [[Webster Thayer]], who had criticized a jury for acquitting an anarchist in a trial he presided at two months earlier. Vanzetti's lawyer was [[James Vahey]], a distinguished Boston trial lawyer and former two-time candidate for governor of Massachusetts and former law partner of the prosecuting attorney Frederick Katzmann. 

The defense produced sixteen witnesses <U+2014> Italians from Plymouth who claimed they had bought eels for the Christmas holiday from him.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}{{When|date=January 2010}}{{Who|date=January 2010}}

The prosecution presented several witnesses who put Vanzetti at the scene of the attempted robbery. The prosecution also presented shotgun shells found on Vanzetti when he was arrested.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} 

Vanzetti was found guilty and Judge Thayer sentenced him to a term of 12 to 15 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Judge Thayer allegedly stated to the jury "This man, (Vanzetti) although he may not have actually committed the crime attributed to him, is nevertheless culpable, because he is the enemy of our existing institutions."<ref>Boyer, Richards. ''Labor's Untold Story''. United Front: San Francisco, 1955</ref> There is no record of this statement in the full trial transcript.

Years later, shortly before his execution in 1927, Vanzetti said that Vahey "sold me for thirty golden money like Judas sold Jesus Christ" and charged that Vahey conspired with the prosecutor "to agitate still more the passion of the juror, the prejudice of the juror" towards "people of our principles, against the foreigner, against slackers."<ref>Amerika-Institut: [http://www.amerikanistik.uni-muenchen.de/studium/lehre/kursmaterial/material_kult/gkkultur2/syllabus/09.pdf ''Last Statements (1927), Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti''], accessed June 22, 2010. "[[Slacker]]" was the contemporary term for "draft dodger."</ref> Vanzetti also claimed his lawyer convinced him not to testify on his own behalf, fearing that his anarchist politics might sway the jury against him. Vanzetti's failure to take the witness stand is thought to have convinced the jury of his guilt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Second trial==
Later Sacco and Vanzetti both stood trial for murder in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]] for the South Braintree killings, with [[Webster Thayer]] again presiding. (Thayer had asked to be assigned the trial.)  Well aware of the Galleanists' reputation for constructing dynamite bombs of extraordinary power, Massachusetts authorities took great pains to defend against a possible bombing attack. Workers outfitted the Dedham courtroom where the trial was to be held with cast-iron bomb shutters (painted to match the wooden ones fitted elsewhere in the building) and heavy, sliding steel doors that could protect that section of the courthouse from blast effect in the event of a bomb attack. Each day during the trial, Sacco and Vanzetti were escorted in and out of the courtroom under a heavy armed guard.

Vanzetti again claimed that he had been selling fish at the time of the Braintree robbery. Sacco claimed that he had been in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in order to gain a passport from the Italian [[Consul (representative)|consulate.]] He had claimed to have had lunch in Boston's North end with several friends, each of whom testified on his behalf. Prior to the trial, Sacco's lawyer, Fred Moore, went to great lengths to contact the consulate employee Sacco said he had talked with on the afternoon of the crime. Moore's friend found the man back in Italy. The clerk said he remembered Sacco because of the unusually large passport photo he presented. The clerk also remembered the date <U+2014> April 15, 1920. Moore's friend tried to get the clerk to return to America to testify but the clerk, in ill health, refused. What could have been key alibi testimony by a reputable clerk was reduced to a sworn deposition read aloud in court and quickly questioned by the prosecution, which claimed Sacco's visit to the consulate could not be established with certainty. The prosecution also pointed out that Sacco's dinner companions were fellow [[anarchist]]s.

Much of the trial focused on material evidence, notably bullets, guns, and a cap. Prosecution witnesses testified that the .32-caliber bullet that had killed Berardelli was of a brand so obsolete that the only bullets similar to it that anyone could locate to make comparisons were those in Sacco's pockets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Yet ballistics evidence, which was presented in exhaustive detail, was equivocal. Prosecutor Frederick Katzmann, after initially promising he would not try to link any fatal bullet with Sacco's gun, changed his mind after the defense arranged test firings of the gun. Sacco, claiming he had nothing to hide, had allowed his gun to be test-fired, with experts for both sides present, during the trial's second week. The prosecution then matched bullets fired through the gun to those taken from one of the slain guards. In court, two prosecution experts swore that one of the fatal bullets, quickly labeled Bullet III, matched one of those test-fired. Two defense experts said the bullet did not match.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Years later, defense lawyers would suggest that the fatal bullet had been substituted by the prosecution. Noting that witnesses swore to seeing one gunman pump bullets into Berardelli, they asked how only one of four bullets found in the deceased could have come from Sacco's gun.

Even more doubt surrounded Vanzetti's gun. Since all of the bullets found at the scene were .32 caliber and Vanzetti's gun was .38 caliber, there was no direct evidence tying Vanzetti's gun to the crime scene.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sacco Guilty, Vanzetti Innocent? |first=Francis |last=Russell |journal=American Heritage |volume=13 |issue=4 |month=June |year=1962 |pages=111 |quote=About the gun found on Vanzetti there is too much uncertainty to come to any conclusion. Being of .38 caliber, it was obviously not used at South Braintree, where all the bullets fired were .32's}}</ref> The prosecution claimed it had originally belonged to the slain guard and that it had been stolen during the robbery. No one testified to seeing anyone take the gun, but the guard, while carrying $15,776.51 in cash through the street, had no gun on him when found dead. The prosecution traced the gun to a Boston repair shop where the guard had dropped it off a few weeks before the murder. The defense, however, was able to raise doubts, noting that the repair shop had no record of the gun ever being picked up and that the guard's widow had told a friend that he might not have been killed had he claimed his gun. Still, the jury believed this link as well.

The prosecution's final piece of material evidence was a flop-eared cap claimed to have been Sacco's. Sacco tried the cap on in court and, according to two newspaper sketch artists who ran cartoons the next day, it was too small, sitting high on his head. But Katzmann insisted the cap fitted Sacco and continued to refer to it as his.

Further controversy clouded the prosecution witnesses who identified Sacco at the scene of the crime. One, a bookkeeper named Mary Splaine, precisely described Sacco as the man she saw firing from the getaway car. Yet cross examination revealed that Splaine had refused to identify Sacco at the inquest and had seen the getaway car for only a second and from nearly a half-block away. While a few others singled out Sacco or Vanzetti as the men they had seen at the scene of the crime, far more witnesses, both prosecution and defense, refused to identify them.
 
After deliberating for only three hours, then breaking for dinner, the jury returned with a guilty verdict. Supporters later insisted Sacco and Vanzetti had been convicted for their anarchist views, yet every juror insisted anarchism had played no part in their decision. First degree murder in Massachusetts was a [[Capital punishment|capital]] crime. Sacco and Vanzetti were therefore bound for the electric chair unless the defense could find new evidence.

==Motions and appeals ==

Appeals and  protests continued for the next six years. While the prosecution staunchly defended the verdict, the defense, led by radical attorney [[Fred Moore (attorney)|Fred Moore]], continued to develop evidence that raised doubts. Three key prosecution witnesses stated that they had been coerced into identifying Sacco at the scene of the crime, but when confronted by District Attorney Katzmann they denied any coercion. One of them, Lola Andrews, a nurse, told authorities that she was forced to sign an affidavit stating she had wrongfully identified Sacco and Vanzetti. She signed a counter-affidavit the following day. Another, Lewis Pelser, described how he had submitted to alleged prosecutorial coercion while drunk and signed a counter-affidavit shortly thereafter. 

In 1924, controversy continued when it was discovered that someone had switched the barrel of Sacco's gun with that of another Colt automatic used for comparison.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sacco Guilty, Vanzetti Innocent? |first=Francis |last=Russell |journal=American Heritage |volume=13 |issue=4 |month=June |year=1962 |pages=107 |quote=At the conclusion of the investigation Thayer passed no judgment as to who had switched the barrels but merely noted that the rusty barrel in the new pistol had come from Sacco's Colt.}}</ref> Other appeals focused on the jury foreman and a prosecution ballistics expert. In 1923, the defense filed an affidavit from a friend of the jury foreman who swore that prior to the trial, the man had said of Sacco and Vanzetti, "Damn them, they ought to hang them anyway!" That same year, a state police captain retracted his trial testimony linking Sacco's gun to the fatal bullet. Captain William Proctor claimed that he never meant to imply the connection and had repeatedly told Katzmann there was no such connection, but that the prosecution had crafted its trial questioning to disguise his true assessment.

The conduct of trial judge Webster Thayer also buttressed calls for a new trial. During the trial, many had noted how Thayer seemed to loathe defense attorney Fred Moore. Thayer frequently denied Moore's motions, lecturing the California-based lawyer on how law was conducted in Massachusetts. Once Thayer  told astonished reporters that "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" According to the sworn affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti "Bolsheviki!" and saying he would "get them good and proper". Following the verdict, ''Boston Globe'' reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a scathing protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. The ''[[New York World]]'' attacked Thayer as "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case."<ref>''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B11FB3F5F1A7A93CBA8178FD85F478385F9& "Judge Thayer Dies in Boston at 75," April 19, 1933], accessed Dec 20, 2009</ref>

In 1924, after denying all five motions for a new trial, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at his ''alma mater'' of Dartmouth. "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day?" the judge said. "I guess that will hold them for a while! Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them!" The outburst was not disclosed until 1927.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

For their part, Sacco and Vanzetti seemed to alternate between moods of defiance, vengeance, resignation, and despair. The June 1926 issue of ''Protesta Umana'' published by their Defense Committee carried an article signed by Sacco and Vanzetti that appealed for retaliation by their colleagues. In the article, Vanzetti stated "''I will try to see Thayer death'' [sic] before his pronunciation of our sentence" and asked fellow anarchists for "''revenge, revenge in our names and the names of our living and dead.''"<ref>Watson, Bruce. ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Men, the Murders, and the Judgment of Mankind'' (NY: Viking Press, 2007, ISBN 0670063533, 9780670063536, p. 264</ref> In a reference to [[Luigi Galleani]]'s bomb-making manual (covertly titled ''La Salute <U+00E8> in voi!''), the article concluded "Remember, La Salute <U+00E8> in voi!". Both Sacco and Vanzetti wrote dozens of letters sincerely expressing their innocence. Sacco, in his awkward prose, and Vanzetti in his eloquent but flawed English, insisted they had been framed because they were anarchists.

While in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] prison, Sacco met a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] convict named [[Celestino Madeiros]]. Late in 1925, Madeiros claimed to have committed the crime of which Sacco was accused. Medeiros, whose vague confession contained many anomalies, provided the defense with an alternative theory, that the Braintree murders were the work of a gang. 

Prior to April 1920, gang leader Joe Morelli and his men had been robbing shoes from factories in Massachusetts, including the two in Braintree where the murders occurred. Investigators discovered that Morelli bore a striking resemblance to Sacco.  Several witnesses for both the prosecution and defense mistook his mug shot for Sacco's. When questioned in prison in 1925, Morelli denied any involvement, but six years later he allegedly confessed to a New York lawyer.<ref>In 1973, further evidence against the Morelli gang emerged. A mobster's memoir quoted Morelli's brother Frank as confessing to the Braintree murders.</ref> Judge Thayer denied the appeal for a new trial based on the Madeiros confession; further appeals to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court were also denied.

Vanzetti said in his last speech to Judge Thayer on April 19, 1927:

:"I would not wish to a dog or a snake, to the most low and misfortunate creature of the earth&ndash;I would not wish to any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical, and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian, and indeed I am an Italian... If you could execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already."

Many famous [[socialist]]s and [[intellectual]]s, including [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[H. G. Wells]], campaigned for a retrial, without success. Harvard law professor and future [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] also argued for a retrial for the two men, writing a scathing criticism of Thayer and the trial in the ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' in 1927. Chief Justice of the United States [[William Howard Taft]] and some others who believed the pair guilty considered Frankfurter<U+2019>s article to be the foundation of most intellectuals' criticism of the Sacco and Vanzetti case.<ref>Robert Grant, ''Fourscore: An Autobiography'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1934), 366-74</ref>

On April 8, 1927, their appeals exhausted, Sacco and Vanzetti were sentenced to death in the [[electric chair]].

==Governor<U+2019>s Advisory Committee==
[[Image:Alvin T Fuller.png|thumb|300px|Massachusetts Governor<br>[[Alvin T. Fuller]]]]
In response to public protests that greeted the execution order,  Massachusetts Governor [[Alvin T. Fuller]] faced last minute appeals to grant clemency to Sacco and Vanzetti. On June 1, 1927, he appointed an Advisory Committee of three: President [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, President [[Samuel Wesley Stratton]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and Probate Judge [[Robert Grant (novelist)|Robert Grant]]. They were tasked with reviewing the trial to determine whether it had been fair. Lowell's appointment was generally well received, for though he had controversy in his past he had also at times demonstrated an independent streak. The defense attorneys considered resigning when they determined that the Committee was biased against the defendants, but some of the defendants' most prominent supporters, including Harvard Law Professor [[Felix Frankfurter]] and Judge [[Julian Mack|Julian W. Mack]] of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, persuaded them to stay because Lowell "was not entirely hopeless."<ref>Herbert B. Ehrmann, ''The Case That Will Not Die: Commonwealth vs. Sacco and Vanzetti'' (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1969), 485</ref>

One of the defense attorneys, though ultimately very critical of the Committee's work, thought the Committee members were not really capable of the task the Governor set for them: "No member of the Committee had the essential sophistication that comes with experience in the trial of criminal cases....The high positions in the community held by the members of the Committee obscured the fact that they were not really qualified to perform the difficult task assigned to them." He also thought  that the Committee, particularly Lowell, imagined it could use its fresh and more powerful analytical abilities to outperform the works of those who had worked on the case for years, even finding evidence of guilt that professional prosecutors had discarded.<ref>Ehrmann, 255-6, 375, 512, 525ff.</ref>

Grant was another establishment figure, a probate court judge from 1893 to 1923 and an Overseer of [[Harvard University]] from 1896 to 1921, and the author of a dozen popular novels.<ref>''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A15F63A54107A93C2AB178ED85F448485F9& "Ex-Judge Grant, Boston Novelist," May 20, 1940], accessed Dec. 20, 2009</ref> Some criticized Grant's appointment to the Committee, with one defense lawyer saying he "had a black-tie class concept of life around him," but [[Harold Laski]] in a conversation at the time found him "moderate." Others cited evidence of xenophobia in some of his novels, references to "riff-raff" and a variety of racial slurs. His biographer allows that he was "not a good choice," not a legal scholar, and handicapped by age. Stratton, the one member who was not a Boston Brahmin, maintained the lowest public profile of the three and hardly spoke during its hearings.<ref>Bruce Watson, ''Sacco and  Vanzetti: The Men, the Murders, and the Judgment of Mankind'' (NY: Viking, 2007), 311-3</ref>

After two weeks of hearing witnesses and reviewing evidence, the trio determined that the trial had been fair and a new trial was not warranted. They assessed the charges against Thayer as well. Their criticism, using words provided by Judge Grant,<ref>Robert Grant, ''Fourscore: An Autobiography'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1934), 372</ref> would hardly sound harsh to those outside the legal profession: "He ought not to have talked about the case off the bench, and doing so was a grave breach of judicial decorum." But they also found some of the charges about his statements unbelievable or exaggerated, and they determined that anything he might have said had no impact on the trial. The panel's reading of the trial transcript convinced them that Thayer "tried to be scrupulously fair." The Committee also reported that the trial jurors were almost unanimous in praising Thayer<U+2019>s conduct of the trial.<ref>''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70616F83C5D167A93C5A91783D85F438285F9& "Advisers Hold Guilt Shown," Aug. 7, 1927], accessed Dec. 20, 2009; Later Grant allowed that he was "amazed and incensed" at the biased comments Judge Thayer made outside the courtroom.</ref>

A defense attorney later noted ruefully that the release of the Committee's report "abruptly stilled the burgeoning doubts among the leaders of opinion in New England."<ref>Ehrmann, 539;</ref> Supporters of the convicted men denounced the Committee. [[Harold Laski]] said the decision represented Lowell's "loyalty to his class."

==Execution and aftermath==
Both Sacco and Vanzetti refused a priest but both men went peacefully and proudly to their deaths. Sacco's final words were "Viva l'anarchia!" and "Farewell, mia madre."{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Vanzetti, in his final moments, gently shook hands with guards and thanked them for their kind treatment, read a statement proclaiming his innocence, and finally said, "I wish to forgive some people for what they are now doing to me."{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Their bodies were cremated. Sacco's ashes are in Torremaggiore, the town of his birth. The location of Vanzetti's ashes is unknown.<ref>Findagrave: [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7063780 Nicola Sacco], accessed June 2, 2010; [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7062442 Bartolomeo Vanzetti], accessed June 2, 2010</ref> 
Fellow Galleanists did not take news of the executions with equanimity. At the funeral parlor in Hanover Street, a wreath announced ''Aspettando l'ora di vendetta'' (Awaiting the hour of vengeance).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

A few days after the executions, Sacco's widow thanked [[Italian anarchist]] [[Severino Di Giovanni]] by letter for his support and added that the director of the tobacco firm ''Combinados'' had offered to produce a cigarette brand named "Sacco & Vanzetti".<ref name=Pigna/> On November 26, 1927, Di Giovanni and his comrades bombed a Combinados tobacco shop shortly afterwards.<ref name=Pigna/>

Following the sentencing of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1927, a package bomb addressed to Governor Fuller was intercepted in the Boston post office. Three months later, bombs exploded in the New York subway, in a Philadelphia church, and at the home of the mayor of Baltimore. One of the jurors in the Dedham trial had his house bombed, throwing him and his family from their beds. Less than a year after the executions, a bomb destroyed the front porch of the home of executioner Robert Elliott. As late as 1932, Judge Thayer's home was wrecked and his wife and housekeeper injured in a bomb blast.<ref name="ReferenceA">''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D1FFC3A5516738DDDA10A94D1405B828FF1D3& "Bomb Menaces Life of Sacco Case Judge," September 27, 1932], accessed Dec. 20, 2009</ref> Afterward, Thayer lived permanently at his club in Boston, guarded 24 hours a day until his death.

Intellectual and literary supporters of Sacco and Vanzetti continued to speak out. In 1936, on the day when Harvard celebrated its 300th anniversary, 28 Harvard alumni issued a statement attacking the University's retired President Lowell for his role on the Governor's Advisory Committee in 1927. They included [[Heywood Broun]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Granville Hicks]], and [[John Dos Passos]].<ref>Bruce Watson, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Men, the Murders, and the Judgment of Mankind'' (NY: Viking, 2007), 311-5, 325-7, 356; ''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40B13FC3C5413728DDDA80894DA405B888BF1D3& "Lowell's Papers on Sacco and Vanzetti Are Released," Feb. 1, 1978], accessed Dec. 28, 2009; ''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A10F73F58107A93CBA81782D85F428385F9& "Assail Dr. Lowell on Sacco Decision," Sept. 19, 1936], accessed Dec. 28, 2009</ref>

==Historical viewpoints==
Many historians, especially legal historians, have concluded the Sacco and Vanzetti prosecution, trial, and aftermath constituted a blatant disregard for political [[civil liberties]], especially Thayer's decision to deny a retrial. Judge Webster Thayer, who heard the case, allegedly described the two as "[[anarchist]] bastards."<ref>Joe Nickell, John F. Fischer. ''Crime Science: Methods of Forensic Detection''. [[University Press of Kentucky]] (December 17, 1998), ISBN 0813120918, ISBN 978-0813120911, p. 103.

Both men had previously fled to Mexico, changing their names in order to evade draft registration required for citizenship application, a fact used against them by the prosecutor in their trial for murder. This implication of guilt by the commission of unrelated acts is one of the most persistent criticisms leveled against the trial. Sacco and Vanzetti's supporters would later argue that the men merely fled the country to avoid persecution and conscription, their critics, to escape detection and arrest for militant and seditious activities in the United States. But other anarchists{{Who|date=June 2010}} who fled with them revealed the probable reason in a 1953 Book:

<blockquote>Several score Italian anarchists left the United States for Mexico. Some have suggested they did so because of cowardice. Nothing could be more false. The idea to go to Mexico arose in the minds of several comrades who were alarmed by the idea that, remaining in the United States, they would be forcibly restrained from leaving for Europe, where the revolution that had burst out in Russia that February promised to spread all over the continent.<ref>Un Trentennio di Attivita Anarchica (1914-1945) (Thirty Years of Anarchist Activities) Cesena, Italy, 1953</ref></blockquote>

Some critics felt that the authorities and jurors were influenced by strong [[Anti-Italianism|anti-Italian prejudice]] and prejudice against immigrants widely held at the time, especially in New England. Fred Moore compared the chances of an Italian getting a fair trial in Boston to a black person getting one in the American South.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Against charges of racism and racial prejudice, others pointed out that both men were known anarchist members of a militant organization, members of which had been conducting a violent campaign of bombing and attempted assassinations, acts condemned by the Italian-American community and Americans of all backgrounds. Though in general anarchist groups did not finance their militant activities through bank robberies, a fact noted by the investigators of the Bureau of Investigation, this was not true of the ''Galleanist'' group, as Mario Buda readily admitted to an interviewer:  "''Andavamo a prenderli dove c'erano''" ("We used to go and get it [money] where it was") <U+2014> meaning factories and banks.<ref>Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton: Princeton University Press (1996), ''Interview of Charles Poggi'', pp. 132-133</ref>  

Others believe that the government was really prosecuting Sacco and Vanzetti for the robbery-murders as a convenient excuse to put a stop to their militant activities as ''Galleanists'', whose bombing campaign at the time posed a lethal threat, both to the government and to many Americans. Faced with a secretive underground group whose members resisted interrogation and believed in their cause, Federal and local officials using conventional law enforcement tactics had been repeatedly stymied in their efforts to identify all members of the group or to collect enough evidence for a prosecution.

Most historians believe that Sacco and Vanzetti were involved at some level in the Galleanist bombing campaign, although their precise roles have not been determined.<ref>Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]] (1996)</ref>  The Galleanists' bombmaker, Mario Buda, reportedly told a friend in 1955, "''Sacco c'era''" (Sacco was there).<ref>Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton: Princeton University Press (1996), pp. 132-133 ("Interview of Charles Poggi")</ref> 
Today, their case is seen as one of the earliest examples of using widespread [[protests]] and mass movements to try to win the release of [[convicted]] persons. The Sacco-Vanzetti case also exposed the inadequacies of both the legal and law enforcement system in investigating and prosecuting members and alleged members of secret societies and terrorist groups, and contributed to calls for the organization of national data collection and counterintelligence services.

When the letters Sacco and Vanzetti wrote appeared in print in 1929, journalist [[Walter Lippmann]] commented: "If Sacco and Vanzetti were professional bandits, then historians and biographers who attempt to deduce character from personal documents might as well shut up shop. By every test that I know of for judging character, these are the letters of innocent men."<ref>Marion Denman Frankfurter and Gardner Jackson, eds., ''The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti'' (NY: Vanguard Press, 1929), xi</ref>

==Later investigations==
One additional piece of evidence supporting the possibility of Sacco's guilt arose in 1941 when anarchist leader [[Carlo Tresca]], a member of the Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee, told [[Max Eastman]], "''Sacco was guilty but Vanzetti was innocent''.."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
" Eastman published an article recounting his conversation with Tresca in [[National Review]] in 1961. Later, others would confirm being told the same information by Tresca. Others pointed to an ongoing feud between Tresca and the Galleanisti, claiming the famous anarchist was just trying to get even.

In 1952, labor organizer [[Anthony Ramuglia]] admitted that a Boston anarchist group had asked him to be a false alibi witness for Sacco."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Though he had agreed, he had then remembered that he had been in jail at that time, and his [[perjury]] could therefore be proven, so he was removed from the alibi list.

In addition, in October 1961, [[ballistics test]]s were run with improved technology using Sacco's [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] [[Semi-automatic firearm|automatic]]. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed Berardelli in 1920 was fired from Sacco's pistol.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sacco Guilty, Vanzetti Innocent?|first=Francis|last=Russell|journal=American Heritage|volume=13|issue=4|month=June|year=1962|pages=110|quote=Making independent examinations, Jury and Weller both concluded that 'the bullet marked III was fired in Sacco's pistol and in no other.'}}</ref> Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported this finding {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. This resulted in some scholars of the case to conclude that Sacco may in fact be guilty {{Who|date=January 2009}}.

The relevance of this evidence was challenged in 1988, when [[Charlie Whipple]], a former ''[[The Boston Globe|Boston Globe]]'' editorial page editor, revealed a conversation that he had when he worked as a [[reporter]] with Sergeant [[Edward J. Seibolt]]  in 1937. According to Whipple, Seibolt admitted that the police ballistics experts had switched the murder weapon, but Seibolt indicated that he would deny this if Whipple ever printed it. At the time, Whipple was unfamiliar with the specific facts of the case, and it is not known if Seibolt was actually recalling Albert Hamilton's testimony and behavior on the stand when Hamilton apparently switched Sacco's gun barrel with that of another Colt automatic.

Sacco's .32 Colt pistol is also claimed to have passed in and out of police custody, and to have been dismantled several times, both in 1924 prior to the gun barrel switch, and again between 1927 and 1961. The central problem with these charges is that the match to Sacco's gun was based not only on the 0.32 Colt pistol but also on the same-caliber bullet that killed Berardelli as well as spent casings found at the scene.

In addition to tampering with the pistol, the gun switcher/dismantler would have had also to access police evidence lockers and exchange the bullet from Berardelli's body and all spent casings retrieved by police, or else locate the actual murder weapon, then switch barrel, firing pin, ejector, and extractor, all before Goddard's examination in 1927 when the first match was made to Sacco's gun. However, doubters of Sacco's guilt have repeatedly pointed to a single anomaly &mdash; that several witnesses to the crime insisted the gunman, alleged to be Sacco, fired four bullets into Berardelli. "He shot at Berardelli probably four or five times," one witness said. "He stood guard over him."{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} If this was true, many ask,{{Who|date=February 2009}} how could only one of the fatal bullets be linked to Sacco's gun? In 1927, the defense raised the suggestion that the fatal bullet had been planted, calling attention to the awkward scratches on the base of the bullet that differed from those on other bullets. The Lowell Commission dismissed this claim as desperate but in 1985, historians [[William Kaiser]] and [[David Young]] made a compelling case for a switch in their book ''Post-Mortem: New Evidence in the Case of Sacco and Vanzetti''. 

Further evidence concerning the Morelli gang came to light in 1973 when a former mobster published a confession by Frank "Butsy" Morelli, Joe's brother. "We whacked them out, we killed those guys in the robbery," Butsy Morelli told Vincent Teresa. "These two greaseballs Sacco and Vanzetti took it on the chin."{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Yet there are others who revealed different opinions, further muddling the case. In November, 1982 [[Francis Russell]], author of a book on the case, received a letter from Ideale Gambera. Gambera revealed that his father, [[Giovanni Gambera]], who had died in June 1982, was a member of the four-person team of anarchist leaders that met shortly after the arrest of Sacco and Vanzetti to plan for their defense. In his letter to Russell, Gambera claimed, "everyone [in the anarchist inner circle] knew that Sacco was guilty and that Vanzetti was innocent as far as the actual participation in killing."{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Russell had originally written about the case, arguing that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent, but further research led him to write a 1975 book, asserting that Sacco was, in fact, guilty. Russell used the Gambera revelation as the basis of a new book in 1986, in which he claims that the case is "solved," and presents his view that Sacco was one of the shooters, while Vanzetti was an [[accessory after the fact]]. While Russell's 1975 book was praised, even by those who disagreed with his conclusion, for being balanced and well-reasoned, his 1986 book was much more negatively received.

Months before he died, the distinguished jurist [[Charles E. Wyzanski, Jr.]], who had presided for 45 years on the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, wrote to Russell stating "I myself am persuaded by your writings that Sacco was guilty." The judge's assessment was significant, because he was one of [[Felix Frankfurter]]'s "Hot Dogs," and Justice Frankfurter had advocated his appointment to the federal bench.<ref>Newby, Richard.

==Dukakis proclamation==
In 1977, as the 50th anniversary of the executions approached, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] asked the Office of the Governor's Legal Counsel to report on "whether there are substantial grounds for believing<U+2013>at least in the light of the legal standards of today<U+2013>that Sacco and Vanzetti were unfairly convicted and executed" and to recommend appropriate action.<ref>"Report to the Governor" (1977), 757</ref> The resulting "Report to the Governor in the Matter of Sacco and Vanzetti" detailed grounds for doubting that the trial was conducted fairly in the first instance and argued as well that such doubts were only reinforced by "later-discovered or later-disclosed evidence."<ref>"Report to the Governor" (1977), 761</ref> The Report questioned prejudicial cross-examination that the trial judge allowed, the judge's hostility, the fragmentary nature of the evidence, and eyewitness testimony that came to light after the trial. It found the judge's charge to the jury troubling for the way it emphasized the defendants behavior at the time of their arrest and highlighted certain physical evidence that was later called into question.<ref>"Report to the Governor" (1977), 761-9</ref> The Report also dismissed the argument that the trial had been subject to judicial review, noting that "the system for reviewing murder cases at the time...failed to provide the safeguards now present."<ref>"Report to the Governor" (1977), 768-73</ref>

Based on recommendations of the Office of Legal Counsel, Dukakis declared August 23, 1977, the 50th anniversary of their execution, Nicola Sacco and Bartomomeo Vanzetti Memorial Day.<ref>"Proclamation by the Governor" (1977), 797-9</ref>

==The involvement of Upton Sinclair==
Upton Sinclair maintained a consistent position in asserting the innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti. In 2005, a letter from [[Upton Sinclair]] to his attorney John Beardsley, Esq., became public. Some claimed{{Who|date=January 2010}} that the contents of the letter were a new or "original" development,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, though everything in the letter was mentioned in a 1975 biography of Upton Sinclair.{{Which?|date=January 2010}}

Writing the letter in 1929, Sinclair revealed that he had talked to Fred Moore, one of Sacco and Vanzetti's attorneys, after the executions. "Alone in a hotel room with Fred, I begged him to tell me the full truth....He then told me that the men were guilty, and he told me in every detail how he had framed a set of alibis for them....I faced the most difficult ethical problem of my life at that point; I had come to Boston with the announcement that I was going to write the truth about the case." Sinclair also said he was "completely na<U+00EF>ve about the case, having accepted the defense propaganda completely."<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/01/28/uptonsinclair-boston.html "Upton Sinclair at Boston"], CBC January 28, 2006. Additional papers in Sinclair's archives at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] show the ethical quandary he confronted. {{cite news |first=Jean |last=Pasco |title=Sinclair Letter Turns Out to Be Another Expos<U+00E9>: Note found by an O.C. man says The Jungle author got the lowdown on Sacco and Vanzetti |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/24/local/me-sinclair24 |date=2005-12-24 |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

In January 2006, more of the Sinclair-Beardsley letter became public. It showed that Sinclair doubted Moore: "I realized certain facts about Fred Moore. I had heard that he was using drugs. I knew that he had parted from the defense committee after the bitterest of quarrels....Moore admitted to me that the men themselves had never admitted their guilt to him, and I began to wonder whether his present attitude and conclusions might not be the result of his brooding on his wrongs."<ref>History News Network: [http://hnn.us/roundup/comments/21325.html "Roundup: Talking About History"], accessed June 9, 2010; republication of Greg Mitchell "Sliming a Famous Muckraker: The Untold Story," ''Editor & Publisher'', January 30, 2006</ref> Sinclair also spoke with Moore's former wife who assured him that her husband had never expressed doubts about his clients' innocence either during or after the trial.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Later tributes==
A memorial committee attempted to present a plaster cast executed in the 1937 by [[Gutzon Borglum]], the sculptor [[Mount Rushmore]], to Massachusetts governors and Boston mayors in 1937, 1947, and 1957 without success. On August 23, 1997, on the 70th anniversary of the Sacco and Vanzetti executions, Boston's first [[Italian-American]] Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] and the Italian-American Acting Governor of Massachusetts [[Paul Cellucci]] unveiled the work at the [[Boston Public Library]], where it remains on display. "The city's acceptance of this piece of artwork is not intended to reopen debate about the guilt or innocence of Sacco and Vanzetti," Menino said. "It is intended to remind us of the dangers of miscarried justice, and the right we all have to a fair trial."<ref>Evie Gelastopoulos, "Sacco, Vanzetti memorial unveiled," in ''Boston Herald'', August 24, 1997.</ref> The event occasioned a renewed debate about the fairness of the trial in the editorial pages of the ''Boston Herald''.<ref>"Editorial: Sacco, Vanzetti skepticism," in ''Boston Herald'', August 21, 1997; Peter B.

There is also a mosaic mural of the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti on the main campus of Syracuse University. 

The "Sacco and Vanzetti Century" was an American anarchist military unit in the [[Durruti Column]] that fought in the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref>Beevor, Antony, ''The Battle for Spain'' (Penguin Books, 2006),127</ref>

There are many objects in the [[former USSR]] named after "Sacco and Vanzetti", for example a factory producing pencils in [[Moscow]], a [[kolkhoz]] in [[Donetsk]] region, [[Ukraine]], and a street in [[Yekaterinburg]]. There are also numerous towns that have streets named after Sacco and Vanzetti.
