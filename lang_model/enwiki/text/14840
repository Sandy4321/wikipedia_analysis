{{About|the British intelligence organization|other uses|Defense intelligence (disambiguation)}}
'''Defence Intelligence'''  is a key member of the [[United Kingdom Intelligence Community]] but differs from the agencies ([[Secret Intelligence Service|SIS]], [[GCHQ]], and the [[MI5|Security Service]]) in that it is not a stand-alone organisation but is a constituent part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD). The organisation employs a mixture of civilian and military staff and is funded within the Defence budget. Like the rest of the MOD Defence Intelligence was subject to the 2008 'Streamlining' initiative in which 20-25 percent of Central London staff were cut. The organisation was formerly known as the Defence Intelligence Staff or DIS but changed its name in early 2010.

Defence Intelligence is a collector of intelligence through its Intelligence Collection Group (ICG) however this function is carried out mainly to support its primary role which is the conduct of 'all-source' [[intelligence analysis]] and assessment. This draws from a variety of overt and covert sources to provide written products and advice in support of military operations, contingency planning, and to inform defence policy and procurement decisions. The maintenance of the ability to give timely strategic warning of politico-military and scientific and technical developments with the potential to affect UK interests is a vital part of the process. DI's assessments are also used outside the MOD to support the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and assist the work of other Government Departments (OGDs) and International partners (such as [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]).

It is this 'all-source' analysis function which distinguishes Defence Intelligence from other organisations which focus predominantly on 'single-source' intelligence.

==Organisation==
Defence Intelligence is headed by the Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) who is a serving [[three-star rank|three-star military officer]] and who, as the MOD's 'intelligence process owner', is also responsible for the overall co-ordination of intelligence activities throughout the Armed Forces and single Service Commands. He is supported by two deputies - one civilian and one military. The civilian Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence (DCDI) is responsible for Defence Intelligence analysis and production, the military Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff - Intelligence Capabilities (ACDS(IC) ) is responsible for intelligence collection, mapping and training. Air Marshal [[Chris Nickols]] is the current CDI.

===Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence (DCDI)===
DCDI manages the analysis and production directorates of Defence Intelligence (known as the Defence Intelligence Analytical Staff or DIAS).  These include directorates for:
-	Strategic Assessments
-	Capability (weapons systems and platforms) Assessments
-	Counter Proliferation
-	Operations
-	Development and Support

DCDI is currently Mr Nick Gurr.

===Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff - Intelligence Capabilities (ACDS (IC))===
ACDS (IC) is responsible for the provision of specialised intelligence, imagery and geographic support services, and for the intelligence and security training of the Armed Forces. ACDS (IC) is currently Maj Gen Jerry Thomas. In addition to a Head Office policy staff he is responsible for two major groupings within Defence Intelligence:

====The Intelligence Collection Group (ICG)====
The ICG Headquarters is at [[Feltham]], [[Middlesex]] and the whole organisation makes up the largest sub-element of Defence Intelligence. It is responsible for the collection of [[Signals intelligence|Signals]], [[Geospatial intelligence|Geospatial]], [[Imagery intelligence|Imagery]] and [[Measurement and signature intelligence|Measurement and Signature Intelligence]] and comprises:
- The Defence Geographic Centre (DGC)
- The Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre ([[JARIC|JARIC, The National Imagery Exploitation Centre]])
- Joint Aeronautic and Geospatial Organisation (JAGO)
- Joint Services Signals Organisation (JSSO)
- Defence HUMINT Organisation (DHO)

In particular the Defence HUMINT Organisation (DHO) is a Tri-Service organisation that provides specialist support to military operations. The DHO manages strategic aspects of defence human intelligence and is under the command of a Colonel. It is based at the Feltham ICG Headquarters and consists of 350 staff who are drawn from across the three services.

The Joint Services Signals Organisation (JSSO) conducts research into new communications systems and techniques in order to provide operational support to static and deployed units. The JSSO is located at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire under the command of a Group Captain with some 1,600 staff drawn from all three services.

JAGO provides force elements from 42 Engineer Regiment (Geographic) as geographic sub-units and individuals operating specialist equipments to augment organic deployed headquarters capabilities, both in the UK and overseas. 

The tri-service HQ JAGO is located at Hermitage, near Newbury in Berkshire and is commanded by an Army Colonel and is composed of three elements:
HQ JAGO commands and controls the organisation's current and future activities. It focuses on the development of GEOINT, geospatial and aeronautical in-service capabilities, exploiting synergies wherever possible.
It provides career and technical management support to relevant service staffs across Defence. The HQ comprises 12 military and 12 civilian staff.
42 Engineer Regiment (Geographic) maintains sub-units and individuals at readiness for deployment and to support exercises. All support is provided by 3 regular Royal Engineer Geographic Squadrons and a Territorial Army Geographic Squadron.
It further provides routine Station support functions to HQ JAGO and the Defence College of Intelligence Royal School of Military Survey (DCI RSMS). The Regiment comprises 390 military personnel and soldiers and 75 civilian staff. No.1 Aeronautical Information and Documentation Unit (No1 AIDU) produces standard and non-standard products and services from 4 Flights; 2 Editorial Flights, a Production and Finishing Flight and a Support Flight. No1 AIDU comprises 108 RAF Officers and Air Cartographer and 35 civilians.

====Defence Intelligence and Security Centre (DISC)====
The DISC, at [[Chicksands]], [[Bedfordshire]], was created 1 October 1996 and provides a single defence focal point for intelligence, security, languages and photography training in the UK. The organisation consists of a headquarters, the Defence College of Intelligence and a specialist operational intelligence capability. DISC is co-located with the headquarters of the [[British Army]]'s [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]]. In 1998/99, it employed 484 staff and its net operating cost was <U+00A3>27 million.
