==Biography==
===Early life===
Chris Lu was born June 12, 1966 in [[New Jersey]].<ref name="NYT1201" /> In 1974, his family moved to the Fallsmead neighborhood of {{city-state|Rockville|Maryland}},<ref name="WP1214">{{Citation  | last = Hendrix  | first = Steve  | title = For Some on Obama Team, Capital Is Close to Home  | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]  | pages = C01  | year = 2008  | date = 2008-12-14  | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/13/AR2008121301988.html}}</ref> where he grew up. Lu is the son of Eileen and Chien-Yang Lu, both of whom are of [[China|Chinese]] dissent and were living in [[Taiwan]], but immigrated to the [[United States of America|United States]] to attend college during the 1960s. Lu's grandfather, Wang Ren-Yuan, was the [[attorney general]] of the [[Republic of China]] from 1960 to 1966 and served as first Representative of the [[Legislative Yuan]] from [[Tianjin|Tianjin District]] during the period of [[Kuomintang]] rule in China. Lu said he was heavily influenced by his father, who worked as an electrical engineer but loved literature and history; the two would read biographies of famous statesmen together and watch the evening news together every night.<ref name="WorldJournal">{{Citation  | last = Chiu  | first = Christine  | title = Chinese-American Chief of Staff Chris Lu assists Obama  | newspaper = [[World Journal]]  | pages = A-3  | year = 2008  | date = 2008-04-20  | url = http://www.asianamericansforobama.com/meet-obamas-legislative-director-chris-lu}}</ref>

In 1984, Lu graduated from [[Thomas S. Wootton High School]], where he served on the debate team.<ref name="WP1214" /> Lu attended [[Woodrow Wilson School]] at [[Princeton University]], where he was the senior news editor of the ''[[Daily Princetonian]]''. Lu's ambition for a political career developed at Princeton, particularly during his internship in the [[Capitol Hill]] office of [[U.S. Senate|Senator]] [[Charles Mathias]]; Lu's college roommate predicted Lu would eventually become a senator himself.<ref name="DailyPrincetonian">{{cite news|title=Obama taps Lu '88 to help run transition|author=Cornelia Hall|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/11/07/22024/|date=2008-11-07|accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> Lu graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1988,<ref name="ObamaFor">[http://obama.3cdn.net/28278b9940416a812f_fqm6y92e9.pdf "Kaleo O Aapi: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders."] ''[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama for America]]'', official campaign literature, pg.4, July 25, 2008.</ref> after writing a senior thesis on press coverage of presidential campaigns.<ref name="DailyPrincetonian" /> Lu then attended [[Harvard Law School]], where he was one of [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's]] classmates from 1988 to 1991. The two did not know each other well at the time, but as Obama was the first [[African American]] president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', Lu was familiar with Obama and admired his talents.<ref name="WorldJournal" />

===Career===
After graduating ''[[cum laude]]'' from Harvard in 1991,<ref name="ObamaFor" /> Lu began his career as a law clerk to Judge [[Robert Cowen]] in the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]]. In 1992, he began working as a litigation attorney at [[Sidley Austin]], a Washington, D.C.-based law firm with more than 1,800 lawyers worldwide. Lu worked in the Washington, D.C., office and stayed at the firm until 1997,<ref name="ChangeDotGov">{{cite web|url=http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/obama_biden_transition_team_announces_more_white_house_staff/|title=Obama-Biden Transition Team announces more White House staff|publisher=Change.gov|accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref> during which time he met Kathryn Thomson, whom he eventually married. Barack Obama and his wife, [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]], also worked at Sidley Austin, in the firm's [[Chicago]] office.<ref name="WorldJournal" />

In 1997, Lu left Sidley Austin and took his first job in the political arena as deputy chief counsel for Representative Henry Waxman and the Democratic staff of the Government Reform Committee of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name="WorldJournal" /> Lu conducted several high-profile investigations during his tenure, including investigations into campaign fundraising during the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential election]], the [[Enron scandal|collapse of Enron]] and substandard nursing home conditions.<ref name="ObamaFor" /> While continuing to work for the committee, Lu also served as special adviser for communications to Senator John Kerry during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]. One of his primary duties there was coordinating the activities of families of [[September 11 attacks|September 11 attack]] victims supporting the Kerry campaign.<ref name="ObamaFor" />

===Barack Obama's Senate office===
After Barack Obama was elected as U.S. Senator of [[Illinois]], Lu left his job at the Government Reform Committee in 2005 to join Obama's office as legislative director.<ref name="ChangeDotGov" /> Lu developed a strong admiration for Obama, of whom he said, "With his quick and incisive mind, Obama is the most intelligent person that I have ever met (in the political arena)."<ref name="WorldJournal" /> As legislative director, Lu led a 15-person group and was responsible for overseeing the drafting of all legislation and floor speeches for Obama. His responsibilities also included advising Obama on all votes and policy decisions.<ref name="ObamaFor" /> When weighing difficult votes, Obama had Lu and his other staff members assemble together and argue about the issue in front of him. David Mendell, a ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reporter and Obama biographer, said Lu was among the "moderate voices in this atmosphere of smart young staffers."<ref name="Mendell">{{cite book |last1=Mendell |first1=David |authorlink1=David Mendell |title=[[Obama: From Promise to Power]] |edition=1st |year=2007 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=[[New York City]] |language=[[English language|English]] |isbn= 0060858206 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=311 |chapter=Chapter 22: The Senator}}
</ref> Lu advised Obama to vote in favor of the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] because he felt it would have been politically wiser to support it, but Obama ultimately voted against it.<ref name="Mendell" />

Lu said of his role as legislative director, "It's one of the most fun jobs in the Senate (but) it's also an incredibly difficult job because you have to know something about any given thing going on in the Senate at the time ... It takes a couple years off your life."<ref name="DailyPrincetonian" /> After one year with the Senate, Lu told ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' Obama was frustrated with "how the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] aren't interested in the issues that he thinks are important to the American people."<ref name="NYT1201" /> Lu also explained part of the appeal of Obama was that "he's like a [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach test]]: you see in him what you want."<ref name="NYT1201" /> During his time on Capitol Hill, Lu met Obama advisors and future White House staffers [[Pete Rouse]] and [[Phil Schiliro]], both of whom Lu considers among his most influential mentors.<ref name="NYT1201" />

Lu eventually became acting chief of staff in Obama's Senate office.<ref name="ChangeDotGov" /> When Obama announced his [[Barack Obama presidential primary campaign, 2008|candidacy for president]] in February 2007, Lu did not move over to the campaign right away, but remained to continue running Obama's operations in the Senate; Lu said of Obama at that time, "Even while he was running for president, he had a day job."<ref name="DailyPrincetonian" /> Lu was a policy advisor for the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]] while simultaneously managing his Senate duties.<ref name="ChangeDotGov" />

===Obama presidential administration===
After Obama's victory, Lu became Executive Director of the [[Presidential transition of Barack Obama|Obama-Biden Transition Project]], a position that was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the transition.<ref name="ChangeDotGov" /> Obama imposed strict conflict-of-interest restrictions on the transition team and left Lu largely responsible for enforcing them; any officials who even appeared to have a conflict of interest in working with the Obama administration had to seek a waiver specifically from Lu.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Kirkpatrick  | first = David D.  | title = In Transition, Ties to Lobbying  | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]  | year = 2008  | date = 2008-11-14  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/us/politics/15transition.html?scp=5&sq=Chris%20Lu&st=cse}}</ref> During the transition period, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter Michael Falcone wrote, "By now, Mr. Lu knows the president-elect's record better than almost anyone."<ref name="NYT1201" />

Obama selected Lu to serve as [[Cabinet Secretary]], making him one of the highest-ranking Asian Americans in the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|administration]]. Lu's responsibilities included representing Obama's positions to each of the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] secretaries and agencies and coordinating a common [[White House]] agenda among them.<ref name="NYT1201" /> [[Marc Ambinder]], associate editor of ''[[The Atlantic]]'', said of Lu, "when agency heads have a problem, or when the White House has a problem with an agency head, Mr. Lu will be the first person who's called, or calls."<ref name="Atlantic1119">{{Citation  | last = Ambinder  | first = Marc  | title = Axelrod, Brown, Craig, Lu Announced  | newspaper = [[The Atlantic]]  | year = 2008  | date = 2008-11-19  | url = http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/11/_david_axelrod_senior_advisor.php}}
</ref> Ambinder also said the position would likely serve as a stepping stone to a more important frontline position for Lu.<ref name="Atlantic1119" />

===Personal life===
Chris Lu is married to Kathryn Thomson, an environmental lawyer. Lu is an avid runner and has participated in 18 [[marathon|marathons]] between 2002 and 2008, including the [[Marine Corps Marathon]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="NYT1201" /> Lu has lived in [[Virginia]], Maryland and Washington, D.C., but said he thinks of himself as a Marylander.<ref name="WP1214" />
