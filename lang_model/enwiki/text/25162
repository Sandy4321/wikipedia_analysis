'''Canek''' (born [[June 19]], [[1952]]), also known as '''El Canek''', is a masked [[Mexican]] [[professional wrestler]] and former Mixed Martial Arts fighter currently performing part time for [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]].<ref>[http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/e/el-canek.html Online World of Wrestling<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

==Professional wrestling career==
In 1972, he debuted as "El Universitario" at the age of 18. In 1973, he would change his name to Canek, a name inspired by the [[Mayan Indian]] leader [[Jacinto Canek]].<ref>[http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/107083.canek-un-gran-luchador-mexicano.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dcanek%2Bmayan%2Bjacinto%2Blucha%2Blibre%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26rlz%3D1B3GGGL_enUS247US248%26sa%3DG%26pwst%3D1 Canek, a great Mexican fighter]</ref>

As the major heavyweight working for the [[Universal Wrestling Association]] promotion, he became one of [[Lucha Libre]]'s biggest attractions during the 1980s. 

Canek started his rise to stardom after winning the National Light Heavyweight Title by defeating Dr. Wagner on [[January 15]], [[1978]]. He would lose that title on [[June 20]] of that same year to his rival [[Dos Caras]]. On [[September 27]], [[1978]], Canek would gain international exposure by defeating [[Lou Thesz]] to win his first of fifteen [[UWA World Heavyweight Championship]] titles that he would hold during his career. At around the same time, the UWA made a talent trading agreement with [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]. Japanese superstars like [[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Riki Ch<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]] would travel to Mexico to face Canek, while Canek would travel to Japan to face stars like [[Tiger Mask]] and [[Tatsumi Fujinami]]. Canek's matches against foreign superstars drew such large crowds that UWA would continue using this same formula for more than a decade. 

Although the UWA ceased to exist in 1995, Canek continued defending and trading the UWA title, although his June 2004 loss at the hands of former partner [[Dr. Wagner, Jr.]] may signal a long break in Canek's monopoly as Dr. Wagner Jr. remains the reigning title holder.

Canek holds victories over several international stars including [[Lou Thesz]], [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Andr<U+00E9> the Giant]], [[Rodney Anoa'i|Yokozuna]], [[Big Van Vader]], [[Owen Hart]] and Japanese stars [[Tatsumi Fujinami]], [[Riki Ch<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]] and [[Masanori Toguchi|Kim Duk]]. During the 90's, [[Canek]] had a very long feud with [[Mil Mascaras]] who he never defeated. He famously bodyslammed both Andre the Giant and Yokozuna (under the name Kokina).

Canek has also competed in [[MMA]] matches in Japan and even owns a win against [[Osamu Tachihikari]].

Canek signed a contract with AWC wrestling in late 2007.  He won the AWC Heavyweight Championship but lost it a few weeks later.  In early March he retired due to an incident.
