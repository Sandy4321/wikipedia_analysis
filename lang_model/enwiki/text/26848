'''''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]''''' is a [[British television]] music competition to find new singing talent; the winner of which receives a <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million recording contract with the [[Syco Music]] record label.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/essex/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_9281000/9281554.stm|title=X Factor winner Matt Cardle hailed by his Essex family|date=13 December 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 December 2010}}</ref> The seventh series started on [[ITV]] on 21 August 2010 and ended on 12 December 2010. The winner was [[Matt Cardle]] and his debut single "[[When We Collide]]" was released after the final. Cardle was mentored throughout by [[Dannii Minogue]], who won as mentor for the second time. A total of 15,448,019 votes were cast throughout the series. It was presented by [[Dermot O'Leary]], with spin-off show ''[[The Xtra Factor]]'' hosted by [[Konnie Huq]] on [[ITV2]], who took over from [[Holly Willoughby]].

The competition was split into several stages: auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses and live shows. Auditions took place throughout June and July 2010, with [[Simon Cowell]], [[Louis Walsh]] and [[Cheryl Cole]] returning as judges. Special guest judges were brought in to replace Minogue, who was on maternity leave. Cole missed the auditions in Manchester and bootcamp because she had malaria. Following bootcamp, successful acts were split into four categories: Boys (male soloists aged 16 to 28), Girls (female soloists aged 16 to 28), Over-28s (soloists aged 29 and over) and Groups. Minogue returned for the judges' houses stage, and each judge mentored eight acts through judges' houses. The live shows started on 9 October 2010. Four acts eliminated at judges' houses were brought back as wildcards, making this the first series to have 16 acts perform in the live shows. This series was the last with Cowell, Minogue and Cole as judges, as [[Gary Barlow]], [[Kelly Rowland]] and [[Tulisa Contostavlos]] replaced them in [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|series 8]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://xfactor.itv.com/2010/news/article/read_cheryl-cole-joins-the-x-factor-usa_item_101017.htm|title=Cheryl Cole joins The X Factor USA|date=May 2011|work=The X Factor|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="news.com.au">{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/minogue-drops-uk-to-keep-aus-tv/story-fn7mjoe2-1226056425305|title=Minogue's shock split with TV show|last=NewsCore|date=16 May 2011|work=[[news.com.au]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>

This was the first series of the show to be filmed in [[High-definition television|high definition]], and was simulcast on [[ITV1 HD]] and [[STV HD]]. From October, ''The Xtra Factor'' was also shown in high definition, simulcast on the new channel [[ITV2 HD]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1299863/ITV-launch-subscription-HD-channels-Sky.html|title=ITV to launch swathe of new subscription-only HD channels on Sky|date=4 August 2010|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|location=London|accessdate=4 August 2010|first=Liz|last=Thomas}}</ref> It was sponsored by [[TalkTalk]] in the United Kingdom and [[Dominos Pizza]] in Ireland.

This series proved to be highly controversial, with many people complaining about the use of [[pitch correction]] software on the broadcast of contestants' auditions, the decision to form two groups out of rejected soloists, the rejection of popular contestant Gamu Nhengu at judges' houses and Cole's failure to vote to eliminate an act in week 5 of the live shows. Controversy also surrounded contestants Shirlena Johnson, who was axed over fears for her mental health, and [[Treyc Cohen]], who was reported to already have a record deal when the live shows started. There were also accusations of fixing, which were denied by the show's producers. It was the most watched series to date, with an average of 14.13&nbsp;million viewers per episode. The final was watched by 17.71&nbsp;million people, making it the highest rated television episode of 2010 in the UK.

The live shows took place at [[The Fountain Studios]] in [[Wembley]], north-west London.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1329109/X-FACTOR-2010-Katie-Waissel-X-Factor-finalists-wig-ahead-Elton-John-themed-live-show.html|title=Katie Waissel and the X Factor finalists wig-out ahead of double eviction results show|last=Thompson|first=Jodie|date=12 November 2010|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=12 November 2010|location=London}}</ref> They started on 9 October 2010, with contestants performing on the Saturday night shows and the results being announced on the Sunday night shows. As previously, each week had a different song theme. The two acts with the fewest public votes were in the bottom two and sang again in the "final showdown". The songs they performed in the bottom two were of their own choice and did not necessarily follow that week's theme. The four judges then each chose one act from the bottom two that they wanted to be eliminated from the show. If each act received an equal number of judges' votes, the result was deadlocked and the act with the fewest public votes was eliminated. The first live show was extended to two and a half hours to include a surprise twist,<ref name="Madonna">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a279722/madonna-to-appear-on-x-factor-live-show.html|title=Madonna 'to appear on X Factor live show'|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|date=1 October 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=4 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> namely that each judge was given a wildcard, allowing them to bring back one rejected act from judges' houses, thus bringing the number of finalists up from twelve to sixteen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a281256/four-x-factor-wildcard-acts-revealed.html|title=Four 'X Factor' wildcard acts revealed|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|date=9 October 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=9 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> Owing to the addition of the wildcards, the first two results were double eliminations. The eighth result was also a double elimination.<ref name="week 8 double" /> In the case of a double elimination, instead of the bottom two, the bottom three were announced and the act with the fewest votes was automatically eliminated.

===Controversy and criticism===
The seventh series of ''The X Factor'' sparked several heated controversies, with over 5000 complaints registered with [[Ofcom]] throughout the series. A spokesperson told the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper that ITV bosses were worried about the number of complaints as claims that the show had become "seedy and oversexed" and accusations of fixing would tarnish the image of the show and ITV.<ref name="Love"/>

====Contestants====
On 25 August, it was announced that contestant Shirlena Johnson had been asked to leave the show because of concerns over her mental health, that she had apparently kept hidden from the producers. Johnson's successful audition was broadcast on 21 August. Johnson's mother claimed that producers knew of Johnson's medical history as they requested her general practitioner's details at bootcamp, but producers said the medical report arrived late. A spokesperson said, "The welfare of contestants is of paramount importance, and for this reason it has been agreed that Shirlena Johnson should not continue in the competition."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1306004/X-FACTOR-2010-Shirlena-Johnsons-mother-claims-bosses-knew-mental-illness.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=Mother of X Factor contestant Shirlena brands show 'cruel' and claims bosses KNEW of daughter's mental illness|last=McConnell|first=Donna|coauthors=Nathan, Sara|date=25 August 2010|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=25 August 2010|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://xfactor.itv.com/2010/news/article/read_shirlena-leaves-the-show_item_100771.htm|title=Shirlena leaves the show|work=[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]|publisher=[[ITV]]|date=25 August 2010|accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref>

The decision to form two groups, Belle Amie and One Direction, from soloists at the end of the bootcamp stage was branded unfair by some of the other groups, as neither had entered the competition as groups. The controversy deepened after Cowell put through both Belle Amie and One Direction and picked just one of the original applicants.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/203418/X-Factor-bands-that-Simon-created-make-last-12|title=X Factor bands that Simon created make last 12|last=Parkinson|first=Dan|date=4 October 2010|work=[[Daily Express]]|publisher=Northern & Shell|accessdate=4 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> Cowell defended the decision, saying that the existing groups were not good enough and other groups such as [[The Wanted]] and the [[Spice Girls]] were created similarly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/156292/X-FACTOR-NEEDS-BAD-GIRLS/|title=X Factor needs bad girls|last=Dyke|first=Peter|date=1 October 2010|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern & Shell]]|accessdate=3 October 2010|location=London}}</ref>

More controversy erupted after the ''[[News of the World]]'' reported that after failing to qualify in 2009, Treyc Cohen signed a management deal with Artimis Music Management Ltd that landed her a recording contract in October that year with [[Birmingham]]-based Ajoupa Records and she released a single entitled "A Time to Be Heard".<ref name="signcheat">{{cite news |url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/showbiz/xfactor/1072426/Singer-Treyc-already-has-a-record-deal-and-has-released-a-CD.html|title=Sign of a cheat|first=Tom |last=Latchem|coauthor=Basnett, Guy |date=10 October 2010 |work=[[News of the World]]|publisher=[[News Group Newspapers]]|location=London}}</ref> The rules of ''The X Factor'' strictly forbid record deals while a contestant is on the show.

====Judges' actions====
Controversy was caused when Cole chose not to send popular contestant Gamu Nhengu through to the live shows. Nhengu was an early favourite to win and many viewers were angered that Waissel and Cher Lloyd were put through despite failing to complete their performances at judges' houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a280074/forums-angry-about-gamu-x-factor-axe.html|title=Forums angry about Gamu 'X Factor' axe|last=Fletcher|first=Ales|date=4 October 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> Around 1,000 people complained to ITV and by 7 October, 220,000 had joined a [[Facebook]] page called "Gamu Should Have Got Through".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/10/07/x-factor-cheryl-cole-and-simon-cowell-fall-out-over-gamu-nhengu-axeing-115875-22614674/|title=X Factor: Cheryl Cole and Simon Cowell fall out over Gamu Nhengu axeing|last=Jefferies|first=Mark|coauthors=Bryant, Tom|date=7 October 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=8 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> Cole reportedly became the target of death threats,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a280560/cheryl-cole-targeted-by-death-threats.html|title=Cheryl Cole 'targeted by death threats'|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=6 October 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> and took extra security precautions in her home as well as at ''The X Factor''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/tv/201675-cheryl-cole-receives-death-threats-over-gamu-decision/|title=Cheryl Cole receives death threats over Gamu decision|date=8 October 2010|work=[[stv.tv]]|publisher=[[STV Group plc]]|accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> Bookmaker [[Paddy Power]] were forced to give odds on Nhengu winning the show after a large number of bets were placed,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a280419/betting-frenzy-on-x-factor-gamu.html|title=Betting frenzy on 'X Factor' Gamu|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|date=5 October 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 October 2010|location=London}}</ref> and made her the favourite to win, but all punters had their losing bets refunded when Nhengu was not chosen as Cole's wildcard.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/features/Gamu+Favourite+To+Win+X+Factor+Despite+Not+Even+Being+On+The+Show-13626.html|title=Gamu Favourite To Win X Factor.

More than 1,000 viewers complained to ITV and more than 2,000 to Ofcom when, in week 5 of the live shows, Cole refused to vote off either act in the bottom two (Cohen and Waissel) and was not allowed to vote last and force a deadlock. A spokesperson for ''The X Factor'' explained: "A judge can abstain from placing a vote. [Cole] made it clear that she would not send anyone home and therefore abstained from voting. [O'Leary] went back to her to clarify that it was going to go to a majority vote if she did that. [Cole] was unable to take the vote to deadlock as deadlock requires a valid active vote."<ref name="majority verdict" /> However, a ''Daily Mail'' poll of 6890 people showed that 4795 of them wanted Cole to be sacked for refusing to vote. O'Leary revealed that during the previous commercial break, when the bottom two was known to the producers, they realised that Cole might abstain and decided in that if she did, they would go to a majority vote.<ref name="majority verdict">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1328268/X-FACTOR-2010-Producers-ordered-Dermot-majority-verdict.html|title=How producers rigged X Factor voting shambles: Dermot was ordered to take majority verdict after Cheryl refused to vote|last=Todd|first=Ben|date=10 November 2010|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=10 November 2010|location=London}}</ref> After the series ended, voting statistics showed that Waissel received fewer votes than Cohen, meaning that if the result had gone to deadlock, Waissel would have been eliminated instead of Cohen.<ref name="Truth about voting">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/dec/13/the-x-factor-voting|title=The X Factor: the truth about voting|date=13 December 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=15 December 2010|location=London}}</ref>

====Accusations of fixing====
After O'Leary's revelation that producers had rehearsed what would happen if Cole abstained in week 5, allegations were made that the result was rigged for Waissel to stay, but a furious Cowell denied this claim, saying he would never want to defraud viewers and said the situation had "been blown out of proportion".<ref name="Furious Cowell">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1328610/X-FACTOR-2010-Simon-Cowell-furious-Dermot-OLeary-stokes-fixing-claims.html|title=Simon Cowell 'furious' after Dermot O'Leary stokes X Factor fixing claims|last=Nathan|first=Sara|date=11 November 2010|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=11 November 2010|location=London}}</ref> O'Leary defended himself and the show on [[Twitter]], saying "We never know which way the judges are going to vote. Ever. The only thing I know is who's in the bottom two when I'm given the card. I don't know which judge to go to until I'm called and the judges, including [Cowell], don't know the vote or who we're coming to next. It's that simple."<ref name="Furious Cowell" /> The following week, ''[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]'' magazine printed a report claiming that Cowell was aware of the public votes before the judges make their votes, and several other media reports contained rumours of the show being fixed. ''The X Factor''{{'s}} bosses instructed their lawyers to file a formal complaint to the [[Press Complaints Commission]] against ''Heat'', saying that the article was a lie, that very few people know the actual public voting results and conspiracy theories being printed in the media are "total and utter rubbish".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.beehivecity.com/newspapers/x-factor-look-to-quell-fix-allegations-with-pcc-complaint1954352/|title=X Factor look to quell Cowell fix allegations with PCC complaint|last=Glanfield|first=Tim|date=16 November 2010|work=Beehive City|publisher=Honeycomb Publishing & Media|accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> ''Heat'' printed an apology in their 1 January 2011 issue and accepted that Cowell was unaware of the votes cast until after the final.<ref>{{cite journal|date=30 December 2010|journal=[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]|location=London|issue=609|page=13|issn=1465-6264|accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref>

There were accusations from viewers of fixing during the semi-final when O'Leary announced that only the public's votes would decide which contestants would make it through to the final, but the next day this was changed and there was a final showdown. The show's official website also stated that it would be decided by public vote, and Walsh confirmed it on a radio show earlier in the week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a291620/cher-mary-sing-off-sparks-x-factor-anger.html|title=Cher, Mary sing-off sparks 'X Factor' anger|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|date=6 December 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 December 2010|location=London}}</ref> It was the first time in the show's history that the judges were given a vote in a semi-final.

{{blockquote|"It's always our sole intention to try and make the show as entertaining and hopefully exciting every week. Our main focus is to ensure that the contestants are given every opportunity to benefit from being on the show and show their talent. Throughout the series I have met with fans of the show on a regular basis and have listened and acted on their feedback. I believe they have enjoyed the changes in the show this year and I feel it's been a better series as it hasn't followed the same pattern as before. This year we decided to give four contestants a second chance and introduce them as wild card entrants on the first live show. And having 16 finalists rather than just 12 meant that we introduced both single and double eliminations. We decided for the first time some weeks ago to put four people into the final and this meant having five semi-finalists. We also felt it would be fairer that there would be a sing-off rather than automatic elimination as there were more contestants. I understand new decisions are seen as controversial by our viewers but it stops the show becoming boring. As the excitement heats up, debates begin but I do want to assure people that the show is definitely not fixed. The sing-off on Sunday was something that was always going to happen regardless of who was in the bottom two. The contestants all prepared their save-me songs on Monday last week. It was always going to be sad for whoever left. [...] I have always listened to and respected our viewers and have always believed viewers ultimately make the right decision. I hope the viewers trust the show that this is a fair competition."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/12/08/dear-mirror-readers-115875-22768831/|title=X Factor fix row: Read Simon Cowell's open letter to Daily Mirror readers|last=Cowell|first=Simon|authorlink=Simon Cowell|date=8 December 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=8 December 2010|location=London}}</ref>}}

===Praise and awards===
In its 7 December 2010 issue, ''[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]'' magazine said series 7 of ''The X Factor'' had been the best series to date, citing many of the controversies, plus events such as Lloyd singing on a spiral staircase, Wagner's "ludicrous" performances and Walsh likening Richardson to "a little [[Lenny Henry]]", as moments that helped make it "the most deliriously, thrilling, controversial and demented yet. [...] This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better."<ref>{{cite journal|date=7 December 2010|title=Everybody's talking about...

His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said "No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they really know the programme's stars. With only approximately 30 minutes of screentime, Gamu had managed to capture the hearts of millions. Whatever you think of Simon Cowell's programmes, you have to give them credit for achieving that."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/realitybites/a292426/x-factor-best-of-2010-countdown-5-1.html|title='X Factor' Best of 2010 Countdown (5-1)|last=Fletcher|first=Alex|date=12 December 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=13 December 2010|location=London}}</ref>
