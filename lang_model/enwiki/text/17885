Leif was the son of [[Erik the Red]] and his wife Thjodhild, and the grandson of [[<U+00DE>orvaldr <U+00C1>svaldsson|Thorvald Asvaldsson]].

Thorvald Asvaldsson was banished from Norway for [[manslaughter]] and went into exile in Iceland accompanied by young Erik.

== Discovering Vinland ==
[[File:Christian-krohg-leiv-eriksson.jpg|thumb|220px|''Leiv Eiriksson discovers America'', by [[Christian Krohg]] (1893).]]
Leif and his crew travelled from Greenland to Norway in 999. Blown off course to the [[Hebrides]] and staying for much of the summer, he arrived in Norway and became a ''[[Hird|hirdman]]'' of King [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]]. Leif also converted to [[Christianity]], and was given the mission of introducing the religion to Greenland.<ref name="snl"/><ref name="sm419">Somerville & McDonald, 2010, pp. 419<U+2013>420.</ref> The ''[[Saga of Erik the Red]]'' and the ''[[Saga of the Greenlanders]]'', both thought to have been written around 1200,<ref>{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Lindkvist|page=212|editor-first=Knut|editor-last=Helle|chapter=Early political organisation|title=The Cambridge History of Scandinavia: Prehistory to 1520|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47299-9}}</ref> contain different accounts of the voyages to ''[[Vinland]]''.<ref name="sm350">Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 350.</ref><ref>Short, 2010, p. 203.</ref> The two only known strictly historical mentions of ''Vinland'' are found in the work of [[Adam of Bremen]] c. 1075 and in the ''[[<U+00CD>slendingab<U+00F3>k|Book of Icelanders]]'' compiled c. 1122 by [[Ari <U+00DE>orgilsson|Ari the Wise]].<ref name="vinhis">{{cite web|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/history.html|title=Vinland History|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|work=[[National Museum of Natural History]]|accessdate=November 23, 2011}}</ref> According to the ''Saga of Erik the Red'', Leif apparently saw ''Vinland'' for the first time after being blown off course on his way to introduce Christianity to Greenland.<ref name="sm419"/>

According to a literal interpretation of [[Einar Haugen]]'s translation of the two sagas in the book ''Voyages To Vinland'', Leif Ericson was not the first European to discover America, nor the first to make landfall there: Leif had heard the story of merchant [[Bjarni Herj<U+00F3>lfsson]] who claimed to have sighted land to the west of Greenland after having been blown off course. Bjarni reportedly never made landfall there, however. Later, when travelling from Norway to Greenland, Leif was also blown off course, to a land that he did not expect to see, where he found "self-sown wheat fields and grapevines". He next rescued two men who were shipwrecked in this country, and went back to Greenland (and Christianised the people there).<ref>http://www.archive.org/stream/voyagestovinland013593mbp/voyagestovinland013593mbp_djvu.txt</ref> Consequently, if this is to be trusted, Bjarni Herj<U+00F3>lfsson was the first European to see America beyond Greenland, and the two unnamed shipwrecked men were the first people known to Europeans to have made landfall there.

Leif then approached Bjarni, purchased his ship, gathered a crew of thirty-five men, and mounted an expedition towards the land Bjarni had described.<ref name="short34">Short, 2010, pp. 203<U+2013>204.</ref> Leif's father Erik was set to join him, but dropped out after he fell from his horse on his way to set sail, an incident he interpreted as a bad [[omen]].<ref>Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 352.</ref> Leif followed Bjarni's route in reverse, and landed first in a rocky and desolate place he named ''[[Helluland]]'' (Flat-Rock Land; possibly [[Baffin Island]]). After venturing further by sea, he landed the second time in a forested place he named ''[[Markland]]'' (Forest Land; possibly [[Labrador]]). Finally, after two more days at sea, he landed in a place Leif named ''Vinland'' (Wineland). There, Leif and his crew built a small settlement which was called ''[[Leifsbudir|Leifsb<U+00FA>dir]]'' (Leif's Booths) by later visitors from Greenland. After having wintered over in ''Vinland'', Leif returned to Greenland in the spring with a cargo of grapes and timber.<ref name="short34"/><ref>Somerville & McDonald, 2010, pp. 352<U+2013>354.</ref> On the return voyage, Leif rescued an Icelandic castaway and his crew, earning Leif the nickname "Leif the Lucky".<ref>Somerville & McDonald, 2010, p. 354.</ref>

[[File:Authentic Viking recreation.jpg|thumb|left|195px|Modern recreation of the Norse site at L'Anse aux Meadows.]]
Research done in the early 1960s by Norwegian explorer [[Helge Ingstad]] and his wife, archaeologist [[Anne Stine Ingstad]], identified a Norse settlement located at the northern tip of Newfoundland. It has been suggested that this site, known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], is Leif's settlement of ''Leifsb<U+00FA>dir''. The Ingstads demonstrated that Norsemen had reached America about 500 years before [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1328355/Helge-Ingstad.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|title=Helge Ingstad|date=March 30, 2001|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref><ref name="s207">Short, 2010, p. 207.</ref> Later archaeological evidence suggests that ''Vinland'' may have been the areas around the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]], and that the L'Anse aux Meadows site was a ship repair station and waypoint for voyages there.

The ''Saga of Erik the Red'' mentions two other settlements in ''Vinland'': a settlement called ''[[Straumfj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>|Straumfjord]]'', which lay beyond ''Kjalarnes'' promontory and the [[Wonderstrands]], and one called ''H<U+00F3>p'' which was located even farther south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/vikings/voyage/subset/vinland/sagas.html|title=Vinland Sagas|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|work=[[National Museum of Natural History]]|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}</ref>

==Legacy==
=== Norse and medieval Europe ===
Leif's successful expedition in Vinland encouraged [[Norse colonization of the Americas|other Norsemen to also make the journey]]. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, so-called ''[[Skr<U+00E6>ling|skr<U+00E6>lingjar]]'', was made by Leif's brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing.<ref name="s2036"/> In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to ''Markland'' for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries.<ref>Schledermann, Peter. (1996). Voices in Stone. ''A Personal Journey into the Arctic Past''. Komatik Series no. 5. Calgary: The Arctic Institute of North America and the University of Calgary.</ref><ref>Sutherland, Patricia. (2000). "The Norse and Native Norse Americans". In William W. Fitzhugh and Elisabeth I. Ward, eds., ''Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga'', pp. 238-247. Washington, DC: The Smithsonian Institution.</ref> The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it was assumed to be public knowledge, or both.<ref name="vinhis"/> Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as [[Adam of Bremen]] made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.<ref name="s2036">Short, 2010, pp. 203-206.</ref>

=== United States ===
[[File:LeifErikson1968stamp.jpg|upright|thumb|100px|US stamp issued on Leif Erikson Day, 1968.]]
Stories of Leif's journey to North America had a profound effect on the identity and self-perception of later [[Scandinavian American|Nordic Americans]] and Nordic immigrants to the [[United States]].<ref name="dregni"/> The first statue of Leif (by [[Anne Whitney]])<ref>Forbes, Alan and Ralph M. Eastman, "Some Statues of Boston: Reproductions of some of the statues for which Boston is famous, with information concerning the personalities and events memorialized", State Street Trust Company, Boston MA 1946 and Forbes, Alan and Ralph M. Eastman, "Other Statues of Boston", State Street Trust Company, Boston MA 1947.</ref> was erected in [[Boston]] in 1887, as many believed that Vinland could have been located at [[Cape Cod]];<ref name="dregni"/> not long after, [[Leif, the Discoverer (Whitney)|another casting of Whitney's statue]] was erected in [[Milwaukee]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Buck |first1=Diane M |last2=Palmer |first2=Virginia A |title=Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook |publisher=The State Historical Society of Wisconsin |location=Madison |year=1995 |pages=9<U+2013>12 |isbn=978-0870202766}}</ref> A statue was also erected in [[Chicago]] in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] to coincide with the arrival of a reconstructed Viking ship from [[Bergen]], Norway.<ref name="dregni"/> Another work of art made for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the painting ''Leiv Eiriksson oppdager Amerika'' by [[Christian Krohg]], was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the [[National Gallery of Norway]] in 1900.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Leiv Eiriksson oppdager Amerika|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Leiv_Eiriksson_oppdager_Amerika|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref>

For the centenary of the first official immigration of Norwegians to America, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] stated at the 1925 [[Minnesota State Fair]], to a crowd of 100,000 people, that Leif had indeed been the first European to discover America.<ref name="dregni"/> Further statues of Leif were erected at the [[Minnesota State Capitol]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] in 1949, near [[Lake Superior]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] in 1956, and in downtown [[Seattle]].<ref name="dregni"/>

The date October 9 has been used to remember Leif Ericson in the United States. In 1929, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] passed a bill to make October 9 "Leif Erikson Day" in the state; the bill was signed by Governor [[Walter J. Kohler, Sr.]] in May of the same year.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.nb.no/leiveriksson/leiv_carl.html|first=Carl G. O.|last=Hansen|title=My Minneapolis|year=1956|chapter=Leif Erikson Comes to the Front|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref> That date was not chosen to commemorate any event in the life of the explorer. Rather, it marked the first organized immigration from Norway to the United States when the ship ''[[Restauration (ship)|Restauration]]'', coming from [[Stavanger]], arrived in New York Harbor on October 9, 1825.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Leif Erikson Day, 2009|publisher=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary]]|date=October 7, 2009|accessdate=November 20, 2011|first=Barack|last=Obama|authorlink=Barack Obama|accessdate=November 20, 2011|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/presidential-proclamation-leif-erikson-day}}</ref> In 1964 the [[United States Congress]] authorized and requested the president to proclaim October 9 of each year as "[[Leif Erikson Day]]".<ref name="dregni"/>
