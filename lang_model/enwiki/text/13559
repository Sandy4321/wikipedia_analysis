The '''1869 Atlantic hurricane season''' was the earliest season in the [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane database]] in which there were at least ten [[tropical cyclone]]s.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Initially there were only three known storms in the year, but additional research uncovered the additional storms.<ref name="year">{{cite web|author=Jos<U+00E9> Fern<U+00E1>ndez Partag<U+00E1>s|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=2003|title=Year 1869|accessdate=2011-03-12|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/Partagas/1865-1870/1869.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Meteorologist [[Christopher Landsea]] estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Chris Landsea]]|journal=[[Eos (journal)|Eos]]|volume=88|number=18|date=2007-05-01|page=197 - 208|title=Counting Atlantic Tropical Cyclones Back to 1900|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-01-18|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/landsea-eos-may012007.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> All activity occurred in a three month period between the middle of August and early October. 

Out of the ten tropical storms, seven reached hurricane intensity, of which four made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the United States. The strongest hurricane was a Category&nbsp;3 on the modern-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] which struck [[New England]] at that intensity, one of four storms to do so. It left heavy damage, killing at least one person. The most notable hurricane of the season was the [[1869 Saxby Gale]], which was predicted nearly a year in advance. The hurricane was one of six to produce hurricane force winds in Maine, where it left heavy damage and flooding. The Saxby Gale left 37&nbsp;deaths along its path, with its destruction greatest along the [[Bay of Fundy]]; there, the hurricane produced a 70.9&nbsp;ft (21.6&nbsp;m) high tide near the head of the bay.

The first tropical cyclone of the season was observed on August&nbsp;12, about 500&nbsp;mi (800&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Cape Race]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Its entire track was unknown, and its existence was only confirmed for 24&nbsp;hours, based on three ship reports. The second, a [[barque]] with the name "Prinze Frederik Carl", sustained damage to all of its sails. The [[Hurricane Research Division]] (HRD) assessed the storm to have moved northeastward in its limited duration, and based on the ship reports estimated peak winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h); this would make it a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the modern-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]].<ref name="year"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

By August&nbsp;16, a strong hurricane was located in the northwestern [[Gulf of Mexico]] south of [[Louisiana]]. With estimated winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h), it tracked westward and struck [[Texas]] on [[Matagorda Island]] before passing near [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]]. The hurricane quickly weakened over land and dissipated late on August&nbsp;17.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} Damage from the hurricane was heaviest in Refugio and [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]]. In the latter city, strong waves damaged wharves and boats while the [[storm surge]] flooded the streets with about {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water. Intense winds knocked down several houses as well as a church, and many buildings lost their roofs. In [[Sabine Pass, Texas|Sabine Pass]], the winds ruined a variety of fruit crops.<ref name="tx">{{cite web|author=[[David M.

===Hurricane Three===
The third hurricane of the season was only known due to it affecting one ship. A vessel in the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] reported a hurricane on August&nbsp;27, about halfway between Bermuda and the [[Azores]]. The storm was estimated to have been moving north-northwestward with winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h), although its entire track is unknown.<ref name="year"/>{{Clear}}

A tropical storm was first observed on September&nbsp;1 to the east of the Bahamas. There, it left heavy damage to a brig sailing from [[Nassau]] to [[New York]]. The storm tracked generally northeastward, affecting another ship with damaging on September&nbsp;2 near Bermuda. The storm's entire track is unknown.<ref name="year"/>{{Clear}}

On September&nbsp;4, a hurricane was located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, moving north-northwestward. The next day, it moved ashore in southeastern [[Louisiana]] with winds estimated at 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h), passing west of [[New Orleans]]. It dissipated early on September&nbsp;6. The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path that caused flooding. In addition, strong winds uprooted trees and damaged fences. High tides flooded [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] with {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water.<ref name="year"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}{{Clear}}

On September&nbsp;7, three ships observed hurricane force winds over the western Atlantic Ocean, between the Bahamas and Bermuda. The storm moved northward, impacting several other ships as it paralleled the east coast of the United States; one of them reported a pressure of 956&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] (28.24&nbsp;[[Inch of Mercury|inHg]]), which indicated the system was an intense hurricane.<ref name="year"/> Late on September&nbsp;8, it reached a peak intensity of 115&nbsp;mph (185nbsp;km/h) with a pressure of 950&nbsp;mbar (28.05&nbsp;inHg).

A ship about halfway between South America and Cape Verde reported a hurricane on September&nbsp;11. The storm tracked generally west-northwestward, affecting several other ships with damaging winds. On September&nbsp;15, a ship traveling from [[St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] to [[England]] encountered the hurricane and observed a minimum [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of 979&nbsp;mbar (28.90&nbsp;inHg);{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}<ref name="year"/> this suggested peak winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="meta"/> By September&nbsp;16 the hurricane had weakened slightly as its track turned to the north and northeast.

===Tropical Storm Eight===
The only basis for identifying the eighth tropical cyclone of the season was from a report by the bark "Crescent Wave". On September&nbsp;14, the ship encountered strong winds and heavy rainfall about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. At the time, the storm was at least {{convert|600|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the previous hurricane.<ref name="year"/>

===Tropical Storm Nine===
On October&nbsp;1, the brig "Jenny" observed "a revolting gale lasting 3&nbsp;days" off the south coast of [[Puerto Rico]], which indicated a tropical storm in the region.

The final hurricane of the season was first observed on October&nbsp;4 by a ship off the southeast coast of North Carolina.

The hurricane was referred as Saxby's Gale after Lieutenant S.M. Saxby of the [[Royal Navy]] predicted in November&nbsp;1868 that an unusually violent storm would produce very high tides on October&nbsp;5; he did not specify the location, however. Although heavy damage occurred New England, the devastation was greatest in Atlantic Canada along the [[Bay of Fundy]]. The hurricane produced a [[storm surge]] of around {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}},<ref name="year"/><ref name="meta"/> which, in combination with the winds, the low pressure, and being in a region of naturally occurring high tides, produced a 70.9&nbsp;ft (21.6&nbsp;m) high tide near the head of the bay.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon A.
