Putri became the first Indonesian taekwondo fighter to set an official debut at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney]], where she competed in the [[Taekwondo at the 2000 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's 49 kg|women's flyweight]] class (49 kg). She moved directly into the quarterfinals with a first round bye, but crashed out in an immediate 2<U+2013>7 defeat to Denmark's Hanne H<U+00F8>gh Poulsen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sydney 2000: Taekwondo <U+2013> Women's Flyweight (49kg)|url=http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/Masters/tk/TKresults.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|work=[[Sydney 2000]]|publisher=[[LA84 Foundation]]|pages=47<U+2013>51|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=No more medals for Indonesia

When [[South Korea]] hosted the [[2002 Asian Games]] held in [[Busan]], Putri secured Indonesia's only bronze medal in the sport, after she was soundly beaten by Thailand's [[Yaowapa Boorapolchai]] in the semifinal of the [[Taekwondo at the 2002 Asian Games <U+2013> Women's 51 kg|women's 51-kg division]], adding this accolade to her silver from the [[2002 Asian Taekwondo Championships|Asian Championships]] a few months earlier.

At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], Putri qualified for her second Indonesian squad in the [[Taekwondo at the 2004 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's 49 kg|women's flyweight]] class (49 kg).
