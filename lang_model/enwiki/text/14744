'''SM U-111''' was one of the 329 [[submarine]]s serving in the Imperial German Navy ([[Kaiserliche Marine]]) in [[World War I]]. She took part in the [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|First Battle of the Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=111|title=U-111|accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>

Completed at Kiel early in January 1918, she went to the Kiel School for shakedown and training until March, when she joined [[4th Submarine Flotilla (Germany)|''4. Flotille'']].<ref>Koerver.</ref> She was monitored continuously by [[Room 40|British Naval Intelligence]] (Room 30), on which her movement reports are based. All her operations took place in 1918.

She departed 26 March on her first war patrol, operating in the Irish Sea and western entrance to the [[English Channel]], sinking two steamers and returning to Kiel and 23 April.<ref>Koerver.</ref> Her second patrol began 27 May, sailing fro [[Heligoland Bight]] ''via'' [[Muckle Flugga]] to the western English Channel. She sank at least one confirmed steamer, and returned the same way, arriving 24 June.<ref>Koerver.</ref> Her third patrol, between 25 August and 29 September, was ''via'' Fastnet and Scillies into the Irish Sea, where she was hampered by British [[anti-submarine warfare|A/S]] patrols and obtained no sinkings.<ref>Koerver.</ref>

''U-111'' surrendered at Harwich 20 November, after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]].<ref>Koerver.</ref>
