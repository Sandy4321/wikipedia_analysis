==History==
===Formation and ''Morbid Visions'' (1984<U+2013>1986)===
Sepultura was formed in 1984 at [[Belo Horizonte]], the capital city of [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil.<ref name= barcinski16>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 16.</ref> At the core of the band were brothers [[Max Cavalera|Max]] and [[Igor Cavalera]], the impoverished sons of model V<U+00E2>nia and Graciliano, a well-to-do Italian [[Diplomacy|diplomat]] whose fatal heart attack left his family in financial dire straits.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 14.</ref>  Graciliano's death deeply affected his sons, providing them the impetus to start a band.<ref>{{cite album-notes|title= Roots|albumlink= Roots (Sepultura album)|bandname= [[Sepultura]]|year= 2005|notestitle=The Roots of Sepultura|url=|first=Steffan|last=Chirazi|pages=p. 13|format=CD booklet|publisher= [[Roadrunner Records]]|location= New York, New York}}</ref> They chose "Sepultura" as the group's name after Max Cavalera was translating the lyrics of the [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]] song "Dancing on Your Grave".<ref name= Barcinski17>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 17.</ref>

The brothers' early likes included popular heavy rock artists of the early 1980s, such as [[Van Halen]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Mot<U+00F6>rhead]], [[AC/DC]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]].<ref name=barcinski16>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 16.</ref> Their listening habits changed dramatically after being introduced to [[Venom (band)|Venom]]. As Igor Cavalera put it,

{{cquote|I remember the first time I listened to Venom, it was on a friend's borrowed tape. It was similar to Mot<U+00F6>rhead, only a lot heavier. I remember someone saying: it's the devil's Mot<U+00F6>rhead! After we got acquainted with Venom, we stopped listening to Iron Maiden and all that lighter stuff.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 19.</ref>}}

From then on the Cavaleras rapidly started listening to bands such as [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], [[Metallica]], [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 26.</ref>

After constant band member changes, Sepultura established a temporary line-up of Max on electric guitar, Igor on drums, vocalist [[Wagner Lamounier]], and bassist [[Paulo Jr.]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 21.</ref> Lamounier exited the band in March 1985 after disagreements with the band, and moved on to become the frontman of the Brazilian [[black metal]] pioneering band [[Sarc<U+00F3>fago]]. After his departure, Max took over the vocal duties. [[Jairo Guedes]] was the invited to join the band as their lead guitarist.<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 28.</ref>

After about a year of performing, Sepultura signed to Cogumelo Records in 1985. Later that year, they released ''[[Bestial Devastation]]'', a shared EP with fellow Brazilian band Overdose. In 1986, the band released their debut full-length album, ''[[Morbid Visions]]'', which is widely considered as one of the first pure [[death metal]] albums.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} It was initially released in the United States on [[New Renaissance Records]], a record label owned by [[Ann Boleyn (Singer)|Ann Boleyn]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}

New Renaissance Records was heavily criticized by the media for signing and promoting Sepultura. However, their song "Troops of Doom" gained them higher airplay.{{Fact|date=February 2009}}

===''Schizophrenia'', ''Beneath the Remains'', and ''Arise'' (1987<U+2013>1992)===
In early 1987, Jairo Guedes quit the band; Sepultura's lead guitarist had by then lost interest in playing death metal. Immediately after leaving Sepultura, Guedes formed Hanky Panky, a "[[cock rock]]" group in the vein of [[Ratt]] and [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]].<ref>Barcinski & Gomes (1999), page 47.</ref> Guedes later on joined brazillian thrash stahlwarts The Mist, Overdose and Eminence.<ref>{{cite web |url=

The band's second studio album, ''[[Schizophrenia (Sepultura album)|Schizophrenia]]'', was released in 1987. It saw a stylisitc change towards a more thrash metal-oriented sound, while still keeping the death metal elements of ''Morbid Visions''. The album was a critical success,{{Fact|date=February 2008}} which led them to being signed to [[Roadrunner Records]]. With Roadrunner distributing ''Schizophrenia'' worldwide, Sepultura reached new and more numerous audiences of metal fans.

This stylistic change and critical success was cemented by the band's third studio album, ''[[Beneath the Remains]]'', which was released in 1989. It was followed by a long European and American tour. Their first US show was held on October 31, 1989 at [[the Ritz]] in New York City, opening for Danish black metal band [[King Diamond]]. It is hailed by ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine as one of the all-time top 20 thrash metal albums<ref>''Terrorizer'' #109 (2003), page 35 (author unknown)</ref>, as well as a gaining a place in their all-time top 40 death metal records.<ref name= terrorizer151>Hinchcliffe 2006, page 54</ref>

Sepultura moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]] in 1990, and began recording material for their fourth studio album, ''[[Arise (album)|Arise]]''. By the time it was released in 1991, the band become one of the most critically-praised thrash/death metal bands of the time, in spite of a lack of mainstream success.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} The album was also their first to chart on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'', reaching #119.<ref>{{cite web |url=

===''Chaos A.D.'' and ''Roots'' (1993<U+2013>1997)===
Sepultura's fifth album, ''[[Chaos A.D. (album)|Chaos A.D.]]'', was released in 1993. It saw a departure from their death/thrash metal style,<ref>Barcinski & Gomes 1999, page 131.</ref> mixing it with [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[hardcore punk]] elements.<ref name= haagsma1993>{{cite web |url=

In 1994, Max and Igor, aided by Alex Newport of [[Fudge Tunnel]], released an even more industrial-oriented album, ''[[Point Blank (Nailbomb album)|Point Blank]]'', in 1994 under the name [[Nailbomb]]. Nailbomb performed only one full live gig, and the performance was released as ''[[Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide]]''. The band also played selected tracks live on Sepultura's 1994 tour with Fudge Tunnel as guests.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Sepultura's death/thrash departure continued with their sixth album, ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'', which was released in 1996. The band further innovated by experimenting with elements of the music of Brazil's indigenous peoples, with a slower, downtuned metal sound.

Later that year, the band played on the [[Donnington]] main stage alongside [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Paradise Lost]], [[Type O Negative]], [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], and [[Fear Factory]]. However, at the height of Sepultura's fame, a series of events broke the band apart. Just after the release of ''Roots'', Sepultura decided to fire their manager, Gloria, Max Cavalera's wife.

Internal tensions within the band occurred throughout the latter half of 1996,{{Fact|date=February 2008}} and at the end of a successful tour of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], at [[Brixton Academy]] on December 16, 1996, the band told Max that they would not renew Gloria's management contract. He then left the band, and subsequently formed a new one, [[Soulfly]]. The other members announced that they would continue under the Sepultura name and were searching for a replacement.

===''Against'', ''Nation'' and ''Roorback'' (1998<U+2013>2005)===
Sepultura chose [[Derrick Green]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] to fill in as their frontman and vocalist. With the new line up, the band recorded their seventh album, ''[[Against (album)|Against]]'', which was released in 1998. The album was commercially less successful than its two predecessors.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} Aided by Max's departure, the band saw a further change in their thrash metal elements.

The band's eighth album, ''[[Nation (album)|Nation]]'', released in 2001, sold poorly. This is probably in part due to having a more pure-thrash metal sound than its predecessors. It would be their last studio album released through Roadrunner Records.

A recording of Max's last live show with the band, ''[[Under A Pale Grey Sky]]'', was later released in 2002 by their former record label, against the wishes of the band.

After recording ''[[Revolusongs]]'', an EP of covers in 2002, the band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Roorback]]'', in 2003. Despite having greater critical acclaim than its predecessors, sales remained low. It was their first album released through [[SPV GmbH|SPV Records]].

In 2005, the band played in [[Dubai]] for the annual [[Dubai Desert Rock Festival]].

In November of that year, a live Double-[[DVD]] and Double-[[CD]], ''[[Live in S<U+00E3>o Paulo]]'', was released. This was the first official live album from the band. <!-- Under a Pale Grey Sky isn't considered "official" due to not being endorsed by the band --> The release of the album marked the first involvement of the new "Sepularmy" street team in promotion of Sepultura. The Sepularmy is unrelated to any of the band members or its record label, and its members are motivated purely by the desire to share the band's music and message around the world.

===''Dante XXI'' and ''A-Lex'' (2006<U+2013>present)===
Sepultura's tenth album, ''[[Dante XXI]]'', was released on March 14, 2006. It is a [[concept album]] based around [[Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Music videos for the songs "[[Convicted in Life]]" and "[[Ostia]]" were released, following on from the album's concept.

In a recent interview in ''[[Revolver Magazine]]'', Max Cavalera stated that Igor and himself would reunite with the original lineup. There were also rumors that the new line up would play on the main stage at [[Ozzfest#Ozzfest 2007|Ozzfest 2007]]. However, this was denied by Kisser and the proposed reunion did not occur.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62221 |title=There Will Be No Sepultura Reunion In 2007|date= 2006-11-15|publisher= [http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net BLABBERMOUTH.NET]|accessdate = 2007-07-13}}</ref>

Sepultura released A-Lex on 26 January 2009, being the first album without any Cavalera member. It is a new concept album based on the book 'A Clockwork Orange'. The album was recorded at Trama Studios in S<U+00E3>o Paulo, Brazil, with producer Stanley Soares.

The band was one of the featured musical guests at the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2008]] on November 13. They performed a cover of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]" and a new song called "We've Lost You" from their album ''A-Lex''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=108884|title=Sepultura Performs at Latin Grammy Awards; Video Available|date=2008-11-14|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref> The 9th annual [[Latin Grammy Awards]] ceremony was held at the [[Toyota Center (Houston)|Toyota Center]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] and aired on [[Univision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=108632|title=Sepultura to Perform New Song at Latin Grammy Awards in Houston|date=2008-11-10|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref>
