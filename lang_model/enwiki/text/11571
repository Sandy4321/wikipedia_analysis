{{Discrimination}}

'''Lynching in the United States''' refers, primarily, to the practice in the 19th and 20th centuries of the humiliation and killing of people by mobs acting outside the law. These murders, most of them unpunished, often took the form of [[hanging]] and burning. To demonstrate a ritual of power, mobs sometimes tortured the victim. 

[[Lynching]] became highly associated with Southern efforts to retain and enforce [[white supremacy]] after the power shifts of the Civil War. In their defeat, whites resisted allowing full legal rights to African Americans. The aftermath of war increased social and economic volatility. The formal end of the war meant that groups shifted to other means to try to resist Federal occupation and changes to the law. 

Economic depression in the late 19th century added to pressures which produced lynching.  Numbers of lynchings rose again in the early 20th century out of fear and hatred during times of rapid and dramatic social changes, when people were competing for work, territory and social place.

The [[Civil Rights]] aspects of the short [[Reconstruction]] that immediately followed the [[American Civil War]], and then again later in the mid-20th century aroused anxieties among white citizens about African American political power. Mobs intimidated and lynched African American citizens and white allies during both these periods. Lynchings during the 1960s galvanized public support for the Civil Rights Movement and legislation.

At the turn of the 20th century in the [[United States]], lynchings were photographed. Picture [[postcards]] were frequently mailed in reinforcement of white supremacy. The practice of sending postcards featuring the victims of mobs was so repugnant that the [[U.S. Postmaster General]] banned the postcards.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,42301,00.html] 

=== Social characteristics ===
[[Image:1774 lynching.jpg|left|thumb|1774 [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]  print depicting the [[tarring and feathering]] of [[Boston]] [[Commissioner]] of [[Customs]] [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] four weeks after the [[Boston Tea Party]].]]
There were often three motives for lynchings in the United States. The first was the social aspect: punishing some social wrong or perceived social wrong (such as a violation of [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]) to restore social order. 

Another motive was the economic aspect. For example, upon successful lynching of a African American farmer or immigrant merchant, the land would be available and the market opened for white Americans. In much of the Deep South lynchings peaked in the late 19th century, as whites turned to terrorism to dissuade blacks from voting and to enforce Jim Crow laws.  In the Mississippi Delta lynchings of blacks increased in the early 20th century as white planters tried to enforce control of labor. 

Lynchings occurred in frontier areas where legal recourse was distant.  In the West cattle barons took the law into their own hands by hanging those they perceived as cattle thieves.  

Journalist and anti-lynching crusader [[#Anti-lynching movement|Ida B. Wells]] wrote in the 1890s that black lynching victims were accused of [[rape]] or attempted rape only about one-third of the time. The most prevalent accusation was murder or attempted murder, followed by a list of infractions that included verbal and physical aggression, spirited business competition and independence of mind. White lynch mobs formed to restore the perceived social order.<ref name="whowaslynched">[http://www.nellpainter.com/nell/cv/articles/32_WhoWasLynched.html "Who Was Lynched?"] by Nell Painter</ref>

The activities of lynch mobs included beatings, dismemberment, [[torture]], and destruction of property. Murder became the common end of lynch mob "policing." Law-enforcement authorities sometimes participated directly or held victims in jail until a mob formed to carry out the murder.

In the view of social historian [[Michael J. Pfeifer]] the United States had two legal systems running in parallel, a legal one in the courts and an illegal one. Both were racially polarized, and both operated to enforce white social dominance.<ref name="capital-punishment">[http://academic.evergreen.edu/p/pfeiferm/home.htm http://academic.evergreen.edu/p/pfeiferm/home.htm], accessed February 20, 2007.</ref>

== Frontier ==
There is much debate over the violent history of lynchings on the frontier, obscured by the [[mythology]] of the [[American Old West]]. Compared to the myths, real lynchings in the early years of the western United States did not focus as strongly on "rough and ready" crime prevention, and often shared many of the same racist and partisan political dimensions as lynchings in the South and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. In unorganized territories or sparsely settled states, security was often provided only by a [[United States Marshal Service|federal marshal]] who might, despite the appointment of deputies, be hours or even days away by horse. 

Lynchings in the Old West were often carried out against accused criminals in custody. Lynching did not so much substitute for an absent legal system as to provide an alternative system that favored a particular social class or racial group. One historian writes, "Contrary to the popular understanding, early territorial lynching did not flow from an absence or distance of law enforcement but rather from the social instability of early communities and their contest for property, status, and the definition of social order."<ref name="pfeifer-frontier-quote">Pfeifer, Michael J. ''Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947'', Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2004</ref>

[[Image:lynching-of-casey-and-cora.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Charles Cora and James Casey are lynched by the Committee of Vigilance, San Francisco, 1856.]]
The [[San Francisco Vigilance Movement]], for example, has traditionally been portrayed as a positive response to government corruption and rampant crime.  Revisionists have argued that it created more lawlessness than it eliminated. It also had a strongly [[nativist]] tinge, initially focused against the [[Irish American|Irish]] and later evolving into mob violence against [[Chinese American|Chinese]] and [[Mexican]] immigrants.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

During the [[California Gold Rush]], at least 25,000 Mexicans had been longtime residents of California. The Treaty of 1848 expanded American territory by one-third. To settle the war, Mexico ceded all or parts of Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Wyoming to the United States. In 1849, California became a state within the United States. 

Many of the Mexicans who were native to what would become a state within the United States were experienced [[miners]] and had had great success mining gold in California. Their success aroused animosity by white prospectors who intimidated Mexican miners with the threat of violence and committed violence against some. Between 1848 and 1860, at least 163 Mexicans were lynched in California alone.<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_2_37/ai_111897839/pg_9</ref>One particularly infamous lynching occurred on [[July 5]], [[1851]] when a Mexican woman named [[Josefa Segovia]] was lynched by a mob in [[Downieville]], [[California]]. She was accused of killing a white man who had attempted to assault her after breaking into her home.<ref> http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awas12/latinas.html</ref>

Another well-documented episode in the history of the American West is the [[Johnson County War]], a dispute over land use in [[Wyoming]] in the 1890s. Large-scale ranchers, with the complicity of local and federal [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politicians, hired mercenary soldiers and assassins to lynch the small ranchers (mostly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]) who were their economic competitors and whom they portrayed as "cattle rustlers."

== Reconstruction (1865-1877) ==
[[Image:Kkk-carpetbagger-cartoon.jpg|right|thumb|A cartoon threatening that the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] would lynch [[carpetbagger]]s. Tuscaloosa, Alabama, ''Independent Monitor'', 1868.]]
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], lynching became particularly associated with the South and with the first Ku Klux Klan, which was founded in 1866.

The first heavy period of lynching in the South was between 1868 and 1871. White Democrats attacked black and white Republicans.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}  To prevent ratification of new constitutions, the opposition tried to harass and prevent people from voting. Failed [[terrorist]] attacks led to a massacre during the 1868 elections, with the systematic murder of about 1,300 voters across various southern states ranging from [[South Carolina]] to [[Arkansas]].

After this partisan political violence had ended, lynchings in the South focused more on race than on partisan politics.  They could be seen as a latter-day expression of the [[slave patrol]]s, the bands of poor whites who policed the slaves and pursued escapees.  The lynchers sometimes murdered their victims but sometimes whipped them to remind them of their former status as slaves.<ref name="whipping">Dray, Philip.''At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America'', New York: Random House, 2002</ref> White vigilantes often made nighttime raids of African American homes in order to confiscate firearms.  Lynchings to prevent freedmen and their allies from voting and bearing arms can be seen as extralegal ways of enforcing the [[Black Codes]] and the previous system of social dominance.  The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]] Amendments in 1868 and 1870 had invalidated the Black Codes.  As white Democrats came back to power, they passed Jim Crow laws.

[[Image:Misissippi ku klux.jpg|left|thumb|Three Ku Klux Klan members arrested in [[Tishomingo County, Mississippi]], September 1871, for the attempted murder of an entire family]]
After years of terror, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1871]].  This permitted authorities to use [[martial law]] in some counties in South Carolina, where the Klan was the strongest.  At about this time, the Klan dissipated.  Vigorous federal action and the disappearance of the Klan had a strong effect in reducing lynching.  From 1868 to 1876, most years had 50-100 lynchings, but from 1877 to 1888, the toll ranged from 1 to 17 victims per year.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

==1877 to World War I==
[[Image:lynching-1889.jpg|right|thumb|George Meadows, Lynching victim, 1889]]
Most lynchings during the 1800s and early 20th century were of African Americans in the South. They reflected the tensions of massive changes imposed from outside and the inability of many whites to deal with power shifts resulting from the war.  They also were a result of long economic stress due to falling cotton prices through much of the 19th century, as well as financial depression in the 1890s. 

The late 19th and early 20th century history of the Mississippi Delta showed both frontier influence and actions directed at repressing African Americans.  After the Civil War, 90% of the Delta was still undeveloped.  Both whites and tens of thousands of African Americans migrated there for a chance to buy land in the backcountry.  It was frontier wilderness, heavily forested and without roads for years. Before the turn of the century, lynchings often took the form of frontier justice and were directed at transient workers as well as residents.  Thousands of workers were brought in to do lumbering and work on levees.  Whites were lynched at a rate 35.5% higher than their proportion in the population, most often accused of crimes against property (chiefly theft), and then of murder.  During the Delta's frontier era, blacks were lynched at a rate lower than their proportion in the population, unlike in the rest of the South.  They were most often accused of murder or attempted murder in half the cases, and rape in 15%.<ref>John C. Willis, ''Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2000, pp.154-155</ref> 

There was a clear seasonal pattern to the lynchings, with the colder months being the deadliest. As noted, cotton prices fell during the 1880s and 1890s, increasing economic pressures. "From September through December, the cotton was picked, debts were revealed, and profits (or losses) realized... Whether concluding old contracts or discussing new arrangements, [landlords and tenants] frequently came into conflict in these months and sometimes fell to blows."<ref>John C. Willis, ''Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2000, pp.154-156</ref> The winter months were when murder was most cited as a cause for lynching.  After 1901, as economics shifted, blacks were disfranchised, and more blacks became renters and sharecroppers in the Delta, only African Americans were lynched.  The frequency increased from 1901 to 1908.  "In the twentieth century Delta vigilantism finally became predictably joined to white supremacy."<ref>John C. Willis, ''Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2000, p.157</ref>

After a wave of increased immigration to the US in the late 19th century, [[Italian-Americans]] also became lynching targets, chiefly in the South. On [[March 14]], [[1891]], eleven Italian-Americans were lynched in [[New Orleans]] after a jury acquitted them in the murder of a New Orleans police chief <ref>[http://www.odmp.org/officer.php?oid=6389 odmp.org]</ref> [[David Hennessy]].  The eleven were falsely accused of being associated with the [[Mafia]]. This incident was the largest mass lynching in U.S. history. A total of twenty Italians were lynched in the 1890s. Although most lynchings of Italian-Americans occurred in the South, Italians did not immigrate there in great numbers. Isolated lynchings of Italians also occurred in New York, [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Colorado]]. 

Particularly in the West, Chinese immigrants, East [[India]]ns, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and Mexicans were also lynching victims.  The lynching of Mexicans and [[Mexican Americans]] in the Southwest was long overlooked in American history.  This was likely due to the overwhelming issues in the South and the fact that [[Tuskegee Institute]], which kept the most complete records, noted the victims as simply black or white. Mexican, Chinese, and Native American lynching victims were recorded as white.<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_2_37/ai_111897839/pg_2</ref> 

Researchers estimate 597 Mexicans were lynched between 1848 and 1928. Mexicans were lynched at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 of population between 1880 and 1930. This statistic was second only to that of the African American community, which endured an average of 37.1 per 100,000 of population during that period. Between 1848 and 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 of population.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-111897839.html</ref>

Henry Smith, a troubled ex-slave, was one of the most famous lynched African Americans. He was lynched at [[Paris (Texas)|Paris]], Texas, in 1893 for allegedly killing Myrtle Vance, the three-year-old daughter of a Texas policeman, after the policeman had assaulted Smith.<ref>[http://www.americanlynching.com/treatment.htm American Lynching]</ref> Smith was not tried in a court of law. A large crowd followed the lynching, as was common then, in the style of public executions. Henry Smith was fastened to a wooden platform, tortured for fifty minutes by red-hot iron brands, then finally burned alive while over 10,000 spectators cheered.<ref>[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5487/ Burned at stake.] A black man pays for town's outrage.</ref> 

=== Enforcing Jim Crow ===
After 1876, the frequency of lynching decreased somewhat as white Democrats assumed political power throughout the South, but 1892 was a peak year.  The threat of lynching was used to terrorize freedmen and whites alike to maintain re-asserted dominance by whites.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Southern Republicans in Congress had sought to protect black voting rights by using Federal troops for enforcement.  A congressional deal to elect [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] as President in 1876 included a pledge to end Reconstruction in the South.  The [[Redeemers]], white Democrats who often included [[White Cappers]] and Ku Klux Klan members, began to break apart the political power that blacks and white Republicans had gained during Reconstruction.  Lynchings supported the power reversal and were public demonstrations.

Another reaction against Reconstruction was the creation of the [[Jim Crow laws]] beginning in the 1890s.  Terror and lynching were used to enforce both these formal laws and a variety of [[Jim Crow etiquette|unwritten rules of conduct]] meant to assert white domination.  In most years from 1889 to 1923, there were 50-100 lynchings annually across the South.  

Racial tensions had an economic base. In attempting to reconstruct the plantation economy, planters were anxious to control labor. They did not know how to work as managers rather than masters. In addition, agricultural depression was widespread and the price of cotton kept falling after the Civil War into the 1890s.  Lynchings erupted when farmers tried to terrorize the laborers, especially when times came to settle and they couldn't pay wages, but tried to keep laborers from leaving.

In 1887, 10,000 workers at sugar plantations in [[Louisiana]], organized by the [[Knights of Labor]], went on strike for an increase in their pay to $1.25 per day.  Most of the workers were African American , but some were white. This seemed to anger Governor [[Samuel Douglas]], who declared that "God Almighty has himself drawn the color line." The militia was called in but then withdrawn. A lynch mob in [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]] killed between 20 and 300 people. An African American newspaper described the scene:<ref name="thibodaux-massacre">Zinn, 2004; [http://www.dougriddle.com/essays/sk20021220.html http://www.dougriddle.com/essays/sk20021220.html], accessed February 20, 2007.</ref>
:"Six killed and five wounded" is that the daily papers here say, but from an eye witness to the whole transaction we learn that no less than thirty-five Negroes were killed outright.  Lame men and blind women shot; children and hoary-headed grandsires ruthlessly swept down!  The Negroes offered no resistance; they could not, as the killing was unexpected.  Those of them not killed took to the woods, a majority of them finding refuge in this city."

Fewer than 1 percent of lynch mob participants were convicted by local courts. Trial juries in the southeastern United States were typically all-white. More to the point, since lynchings were a form of community action, for years juries did not separate themselves from the larger community. Often juries never let the matter go past the inquest. 

In a typical example in 1892 in Port Jervis, New York, a police officer tried to stop the lynching of a black man who had been wrongfully accused of assaulting a white woman. The mob responded by putting the noose around the officer's neck as a way of scaring him. At the inquest, the officer identified eight people who had participated in the lynching, including the former chief of police, but the jury determined that the murder had been carried out "by person or persons unknown."<ref name="port-jervis">Pfeifer, 2004, p. 35.</ref>]

More than 85 percent of the estimated 5,000 lynchings in the post-Civil War period occurred in the Southern states. 1892 was a peak year when 161 African Americans were lynched.

[[Image:Lynching-of-will-james.jpg|left|thumb|330px|The circus-style lynching of Will James, [[Cairo, Illinois]], 1909.]]

Often victims were lynched by a small group of white vigilantes late at night. Sometimes, however, lynchings became mass spectacles with a circus-like atmosphere because they were intended to emphasize a majority power. Children often attended these public lynchings.  A large lynching might be announced beforehand in the newspaper.  There were cases in which a lynching was started early so that a newspaper reporter could make his deadline. Photographers sold photos for postcards to make  extra money. The event was publicized so that the intended audience, African Americans and whites who might fear the Klan, was warned to stay in their places. These postcards were so popular that they became an embarrassment nationally. The US postmaster officially banned them in 1908. Like other forbidden mailings, lynching postcards continued for some time past their banning, to the 1930s.

Fewer than 1 percent of lynch mob participants were ever convicted by local courts. Trial juries in the southeastern United States were typically all-white.  More to the point, since lynchings were a form of community action, for years juries did not separate themselves from the larger community. Often juries never let the matter go past the inquest.

[[Image:duluth-lynching-postcard.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Postcard of the [[Duluth lynchings]].]]
Not all lynchings in the United States took place in the South. In [[Duluth, Minnesota]], on [[June 15]], [[1920]], three young African American travelers were lynched after having been jailed and accused of having raped a white woman.  The alleged "motive" and action by a mob were consistent with the "community policing" model. A book titled ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' documented the events.

Although the rhetoric surrounding lynchings included justifications about protecting white women, the actions basically erupted out of fears of social change and used victims as scapegoats. As attitudes were changing, in 1930 some white women formed the [[Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching]] to repudiate the claim that they needed to be protected by this method.<ref> name="southernwomen">http://lists.econ.utah.edu/pipermail/margins-to-centre/2005-February/000201.html</ref>

According to an article, April 2, 2002, in ''Time'':
:"There were lynchings in the Midwestern and Western states, mostly of Asians, Mexicans, Native Americans and even whites. But it was in the South that lynching evolved into a semiofficial institution of racial terror against blacks. All across the former [[Confederacy]], blacks who were suspected of crimes against whites--or even "offenses" no greater than failing to step aside for a white man's car or protesting a lynching--were tortured, hanged and burned to death by the thousands. In a prefatory essay in ''Without Sanctuary'', historian [[Leon F. Litwack]] writes that between 1882 and 1968, at least 4,742 [[African Americans]] were murdered that way.

At the turn of the 20th century in the [[United States]], lynching was photographic sport, and picture [[postcards]] of brutalized dead bodies swinging from trees and burned at the stake were mailed as commonly as email is sent today. The practice of sending postcards with the pictures featuring the victims of mob murderers was so repugnant, even the [[U.S. Postmaster General]] banned the practice of mailing those postcards.[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,42301,00.html] The practice was so base, a writer for ''Time'' noted that even the [[Nazis]] "did not stoop to selling souvenirs of [[Auschwitz]], but lynching scenes became a burgeoning subdepartment of the postcard industry. By 1908, the trade had grown so large that the U.S. Postmaster General banned the cards from the mails." 

In ''Without Sanctuary'', a book of lynching postcards collected by [[James Allen]], Pullitzer Prize-winning historian [[Leon F. Litwack]] wrote:
:"The photographs stretch our credulity, even numb our minds and senses to the full extent of the horror, but they must be examined if we are to understand how normal men and women could live with, participate in, and defend such atrocities, even reinterpret them so they would not see themselves or be perceived as less than civilized. The men and women who tortured, dismembered, and murdered in this fashion understood perfectly well what they were doing and thought of themselves as perfectly normal human beings. Few had any ethical qualms about their actions. This was not the outburst of crazed men or uncontrolled barbarians but the triumph of a belief system that defined one people as less human than another. For the men and women who comprised these mobs, as for those who remained silent and indifferent or who provided scholarly or scientific explanations, this was the highest idealism in the service of their race. One has only to view the self-satisfied expressions on their faces as they posed beneath black people hanging from a rope or next to the charred remains of a Negro who had been burned to death. What is most disturbing about these scenes is the discovery that the perpetrators of the crimes were ordinary people, not so different from ourselves - merchants, farmers, laborers, machine operators, teachers, doctors, lawyers, policemen, students; they were family men and women, good churchgoing folk who came to believe that keeping black people in their place was nothing less than pest control, a way of combating an epidemic or virus that if not checked would be detrimental to the health and security of the community."

=== Early State and Federal action ===
President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] made public statements against lynching in 1903, following George White's death in [[Delaware]], and in his sixth annual [[State of the Union]] message on [[December 4]], [[1906]].  He triggered a [[filibuster]] in the [[United States Senate]] in 1902 during the consideration of his "Philippines Bill" by intimating that lynching was taking place there.  In 1903 he refrained from commenting on the use of the issue in Southern political campaigns.

Roosevelt did make public a letter he wrote to Governor [[Winfield T. Durbin]] of [[Indiana]], in which he said:

[[Image:TR LtCol 1898.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was against the lynchings.]]
::: {{cquote|My Dear Governor Durbin, ...permit me to thank you as an American citizen for the admirable way in which you have vindicated the majesty of the law by your recent action in reference to lynching... All thoughtful men... must feel the gravest alarm over the growth of lynching in this country, and especially over the peculiarly hideous forms so often taken by mob violence when colored men are the victims <U+2013> on which occasions the mob seems to lay more weight, not on the crime but on the color of the criminal... There are certain hideous sights which when once seen can never be wholly erased from the mental retina. The mere fact of having seen them implies degradation... Whoever in any part of our country has ever taken part in lawlessly putting to death a criminal by the dreadful torture of fire must forever after have the awful spectacle of his own handiwork seared into his brain and soul. He can never again be the same man.}} 

Durbin had successfully used the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] to disperse the lynchers.  Further, Durbin publicly declared that the accused murderer&mdash;an African American man&mdash;was entitled to a fair trial. Theodore Roosevelt's efforts cost him political support among white people, especially in the South. In addition, threats against him increased so that the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] increased the size of his detail.<ref name="increased">Morris, Edmund; '''Theodore Rex'''; pp. 110-11, 246-49, 250, 258-59, 261-62, 472.</ref>

==WWI to WWII==

=== New Klan ===

In 1915, three events highlighted social tensions: the trial and lynching of [[Leo Frank]], the release of the film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', and the revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].  

[[Image:Birth-of-a-nation-klan-and-black-man.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'']]

The 1915 murder near [[Atlanta, Georgia]] of factory manager Leo Frank, an American Jew, was one of the more notorious lynchings of a white man. Sensational newspaper accounts stirred up anger about  Frank, charged in the murder of [[Mary Phagan]], a girl employed by his factory.  He was convicted of murder after a questionable trial in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. His appeals failed. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]' dissent condemned the intimidation of the jury as failing to provide due process of law.  After the governor commuted Frank's sentence to life imprisonment, a mob calling itself the Knights of Mary Phagan kidnapped Frank from the prison farm, and lynched him. 

[[Image:LeoFranknewspaper.jpg|left|thumb|Cover of the ''Atlanta Constitution'' with Leo Frank]]
Georgia politician and publisher [[Thomas E. Watson|Tom Watson]] used sensational coverage of the Frank trial to create power for himself. By playing on people's anxieties, he also built support for revival of the Ku Klux Klan. The new Klan was inaugurated in 1915 at a [[Stone Mountain|mountaintop]] meeting near Atlanta, and was comprised mostly of members of the Knights of Mary Phagan. [[D. W. Griffith]]'s 1915 film ''The Birth of a Nation'' glorified the original Klan and garnered much publicity.  

More importantly, the Klan grew because of people's anxieties and fear about the rapid pace of change, due to the pressure of white and black migrants moving into rapidly industrializing cities of the South, plus greatly increased immigration from southern and eastern Europe and African Americans in the Great Migration entering northern and midwestern industrial cities. The Klan grew rapidly in major cities of the Midwest and West as well as the South, and it reached a peak of membership and influence about 1925. It became most successful and strongest in those cities that had a rapid pace of growth from 1910-1930.<ref>Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915-1930.''

===Resistance===

[[Image:Idawells.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Ida B. Wells-Barnett led a crusade against lynching.]]
By the late 19th century, African Americans had the political experience and confidence to begin to push back against what was a dramatic decrease in civil rights. In 1888, the [[Tuskegee Institute]] began to assiduously document lynchings, a practice it continued until 1968. <ref name="wexler1">Editorial by Laura Wexler, "A Sorry History: Why an Apology From the Senate Can't Make Amends," Washington Post, Sunday, June 19, 2005, page B1; http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/18/AR2005061800075.html</ref>  Journalist [[Ida B. Wells|Ida B. Wells-Barnett]] was shocked when three of her friends in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] were lynched because their [[grocery]] store competed successfully with a white-owned store.  Outraged, Wells-Barnett began a global anti-lynching campaign that raised awareness of the social injustice.

Race riots in the North in 1919 reflected strong postwar social and economic tensions, with job competition among returning veterans, old and new immigrants, and new black and white migrants from the South, together with fierce competition for social place and crowded housing in many cities.<ref>Kenneth T.

Some African Americans fought back, believing that the government would never protect them against lynching.  In Southside Chicago, a young black [[Chicago]]an Eugene Williams, paddled a raft in [[Lake Michigan]] into "white territory," and drowned after being hit by a rock thrown by a young white man. Witnesses pointed out the killer to a police officer. When he refused to make an arrest, an indignant black mob attacked the officer.<ref name="chicagoriot1">Chicago Daily Tribune, http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/4975/</ref> [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919|Violence broke out across the city]].  Police did not take action quickly enough or sometimes at all.  Mobs of white men, many of them organized around Irish clubs and gangs, began pulling African Americans at random off of trolley cars.  Having learned from the 1917 East St. Louis riot, the city shut down the streetcars to reduce those attacks. Southside mobs attacked African American businesses, and beat victims with baseball bats and iron bars. African Americans fought back.  In the rioting, 23 African Americans and 15 whites were killed. <ref name="whipping"/>

African American resistance against lynching carried substantial risks. In 1921 in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], a group of African American citizens attempted to stop a lynch mob from taking [[Dick Rowland]], a 19-year old assault suspect, out of jail. In a scuffle between a white man and an armed African American veteran, the white man was killed. [[Tulsa Race Riot|Whites retaliated]] by rioting, during which they burned 1,256 homes and as many as 200 businesses in the segregated [[Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma|Greenwood]] district. Confirmed dead were 39 people - 26 African Americans and 13 whites. Recent investigations suggest the number of African American deaths may have been much higher. Dick Rowland was saved, however, and was later exonerated.

While the KKK increased rapidly into the early 1920s and achieved notoriety in many major cities of the Midwest as well as South, many states and cities acted strongly against the organization. In most areas, KKK organizations declined steeply and rapidly after 1925, especially as some cities published membership lists, passed laws against wearing of masks, and otherwise acted against the KKK.

[[Image:chicago-race-riot.jpg|frame|left|A white gang looking for blacks during the [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919]].]]
By the 1930s the number of lynchings had dropped to about ten per year in Southern states. With the election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as President in 1932, anti-lynching advocates such as [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] and [[Walter Francis White]], who had campaigned for him, hoped he would support their campaign to end lynching.  

Senators [[Robert F. Wagner]] and [[Edward P. Costigan]] drafted the Costigan-Wagner bill to require local authorities to protect prisoners from lynch mobs. Virtually all Southern senators blocked the proposed bill.  It proposed to make lynching a Federal crime and thus take it out of state administration. The Southern senators used a [[filibuster]] to prevent a vote on the bill. 

A lynching in [[Miami, Florida]], changed the political climate in Washington. On [[July 19]], [[1935]], Rubin Stacy, a homeless African-American tenant farmer, knocked on doors begging for food. After resident complaints, six [[Dade County]] deputies took Stacy into custody. While he was in custody, a lynch mob took him out of the jail and murdered him. Although the faces of his murderers could be seen in a photo taken at the lynching site, the murder of Rubin Stacy was not prosecuted. [http://www.strangefruit.org/rubin_stacy.htm] 

Stacy's murder galvanized anti-lynching activists, but President Franklin Roosevelt did not support the federal anti-lynching bill.  He was concerned that support would cost him Southern votes in the 1936 [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 election]]. He believed that he could accomplish more for more people by getting re-elected.

In 1939 Roosevelt proceeded to create the Civil Rights Section of the [[Justice Department]]. It started prosecutions to combat lynching but failed to win any convictions until 1946.<ref name="wexler2">Wexler, Laura.  ''Fire in a Canebrake: The Last Mass Lynching in America'', New York: Scribner, 2003</ref>

In the 1930s, [[communism|communist]] organizations, including a legal defense organization called the [[International Labor Defense]] (ILD), organized support to stop lynching. (see [[The Communist Party and African-Americans]]). The ILD defended the [[Scottsboro Boys]], as well as three black men accused of rape in [[Tuscaloosa]] in 1933. In the Tuscaloosa case, two defendants were lynched under circumstances that suggested police complicity. The ILD lawyers themselves narrowly escaped lynching. The ILD lawyers aroused passionate hatred among many Southerners because they were considered to be interfering with local affairs.  In a remark to an investigator, a white Tuscaloosan was quoted, "For New York Jews to butt in and spread communistic ideas is too much."<ref name="whipping"/>

==World War II to present==
[[Image:fbi-lynching-poster.jpg|thumb|200px|right|FBI poster asking for information in the 1946 lynching at Moore's Ford Bridge, Georgia.]]

===Federal action===
After [[World War II]], the federal government began to take its first productive actions against lynching.

In 1946, the Civil Rights Section of the Justice Department gained its first successful prosecution against a lyncher. Florida constable Tom Crews was sentenced to a $1,000 fine and one year in prison for civil rights violations in the killing of an African American farm worker.

In 1946, a mob of white men shot and killed two young African American men and two young African American women near Moore's Ford Bridge in [[Walton County, Georgia]].  This lynching shocked the nation and was a key factor in President [[Harry Truman]]'s making civil rights a priority.<ref name="wexler2">Wexler, 2003.</ref> In 1947, the Truman Administration published a report titled "''[[To Secure These Rights]]''," which advocated, among other civil rights reforms, making lynching a federal crime. 

Although in 1924 Truman had paid a $10 membership fee to join the Ku Klux Klan (-when it promoted itself as a fraternal organization), when a Klan officer demanded that Truman pledge not to hire any [[Catholics]] if he was reelected as county judge, Truman refused. Truman had commanded many men who were Catholic in World War I and personally knew their worth. His membership fee was returned and he never joined.<ref name="trumanklan">Wade, 1987, p. 196, gave a similar account,  but suggested that the meeting was a regular Klan one. An interview with Truman's friend Hinde at the Truman Library's web site ([http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/hindeeg.htm http://www.trumanlibrary.org/oralhist/hindeeg.htm], retrieved June 26, 2005) portrayed the meeting  one-on-one at the Hotel Baltimore with a Klan organizer named Jones. Truman's biography, written by his daughter Margaret(Truman, 1973), agreed with Hinde's version but did not mention the $10 initiation fee.  The biography included a copy of a telegram from O.L. Chrisman stating that reporters from the [[Hearst]] papers had questioned him about Truman's past with the Klan. He said he had seen Truman at a Klan meeting, but that "if he ever became a member of the Klan I did not know it."</ref> In the 1940's the Klan openly criticized Truman for his efforts in promoting civil rights. 

In April 2006, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] confirmed that it had an investigation in progress relating to the 1946 Moore's Ford case.<ref name="bluestein">{{cite news | first=Greg, Associated Press | last=Bluestein | title=FBI reexamines '46 lynchings by white mob |date=April 14, 2006 | publisher=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/04/14/fbi_reexamines_46_lynchings_by_white_mob/ }}</ref>

===Lynching and the Cold War===
<!-- [[image:robeson10.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Paul Robeson]] This image was definitely used to indicate the person and not the stamp, and as such is probably a copyvio. --> 

With the beginning of the [[Cold War]] after WWII, the [[Soviet Union]] criticized the [[United States]] for the frequency of lynchings of black people. In a meeting with President [[Harry Truman]] in 1946, [[Paul Robeson]] urged him to take action against lynching. Soon afterward the mainstream white press attacked Robeson for his sympathies toward the Soviet Union. 

In 1951, the [[Civil Rights Congress]] (CRC) spoke to the [[United Nations]] in a presentation entitled "[[We Charge Genocide]]", in which they argued that because the US government failed to act against lynching, it was guilty of [[genocide]] under Article II of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|UN Genocide Convention]].

[[Image:viola-liuzzo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Anthony and [[Viola Liuzzo]], 1949.]]  

In the postwar years, some U.S. politicians and appointed officials appeared more worried about possible communist connections among  anti-lynching groups than about lynching crimes. The [[FBI]] branded [[Albert Einstein]] a communist sympathizer for joining [[Paul Robeson]]'s [[American Crusade Against Lynching]].<ref name="einstein">Fred Jerome, ''The Einstein File'', St. Martin's Press, 2000; foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/einstein.htm</ref> 

During early years of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]  resorted to outright lying to smear [[civil rights]] workers and other opponents of lynching. For example, the FBI spread false information in the press that lynching victim [[Viola Liuzzo]] had been a member of the [[Communist Party]], had abandoned her five children, and was involved in sexual relationships with African Americans in the civil rights movement.<ref name="liuzzosmear">Detroit News, September 30, 2004; http://www.detnews.com/2004/metro/0409/30/c01-289311.htm</ref>
Some people in the FBI believed they were stirring up racial animosity by linking white women with African American men.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

===Civil Rights Movement===
By the 1950s, the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] was gaining momentum. A 1955 case that sparked public outrage about injustice was that of [[Emmett Till]], a fourteen-year-old Chicagoan.  Spending the summer with relatives in [[Money, Mississippi]], he was attacked and killed for having crossed a social boundary (one he wouldn't know since he didn't live there) when he allegedly whistled at a white woman.  Two defendants were tried, but acquitted. People in other parts of the country were horrified that a boy could have been killed for such an event. 

The civil rights movement attracted students to the South from all over the country to work on voter registration and other issues.  The intervention of people from outside the communities and threat of social change aroused fear and resentment among many whites. In June 1964, [[Mississippi civil rights worker murders|three civil rights workers]] disappeared in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]]. They had been investigating the arson of a black church being used as a "[[Freedom School]]." Six weeks later their bodies were found in a partially constructed dam near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. [[Michael Schwerner]] and [[Andrew Goodman]] of [[New York]], and [[James Chaney]] of [[Meridian, Mississippi]] had been members of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]].  They had been dedicated to [[non-violent]] direct action against [[racial discrimination]]. The US prosecuted 18 men with a Ku Klux Klan conspiracy to deprive the victims of their civil rights under 19th c. Federal law, in order to conduct the trial in Federal court. Seven men were convicted but received light sentences. Two men were released because of a deadlocked jury.  The remainder were acquitted. In 2005, 80-year-old [[Edgar Ray Killen]], one of the men who earlier went free, was convicted of manslaughter for the killings and sentenced to 60 years in [[prison]].

===After the Civil Rights Movement===
[[Image:kkk-donald-cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|An inflammatory KKK cartoon from [[The Fiery Cross (newsletter)|The Fiery Cross]] that was used as evidence in the civil trial resulting from Michael Donald's murder.]]
Although lynchings became rare following the civil rights movement and changing social mores, they have occurred. In 1981, two KKK members in [[Alabama]] randomly picked out a 19-year-old black man, [[Michael Donald]], and murdered him.  This was to retaliate for a jury's acquittal of a black man accused of murdering a police officer. The Klansmen were caught, prosecuted, and convicted.  A $7 million judgment in a subsequent civil suit against the Klan bankrupted the local subgroup, the [[United Klans of America]].<ref name="donald">[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAkkk.htm http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAkkk.htm], retrieved June 26, 2005.</ref>

In 1998, [[Shawn Allen Berry]], [[Lawrence Russel Brewer]], and ex-convict [[John William King]] murdered [[James Byrd, Jr.]] in [[Jasper, Texas|Jasper]], [[Texas]]. Byrd was a 49-year-old father of three, who had accepted an early-morning ride home with the three men.  They arbitrarily attacked him and dragged him to his death behind their truck.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/US/9902/22/dragging.death.03/ CNN:Dragging death]</ref>  The three men dumped their victim's mutilated remains in the town's segregated African American cemetery and then went to a barbecue.<ref>[http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=275 Texas Observer]</ref> 
Local authorities immediately treated the murder as a [[hate crime]] and requested FBI assistance. The murderers were caught and stood trial. Brewer and King were sentenced to death. Berry received life in prison.

On [[June 13]], [[2005]], the [[United States Senate]] formally apologized for its failure in previous decades to enact a Federal anti-lynching law.  Earlier attempts to pass such legislation had been defeated by filibusters by powerful Southern senators.  Prior to the vote, Louisiana Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] noted, "There may be no other injustice in American history for which the Senate so uniquely bears responsibility."<ref name="senate-apology">Washington Post, June 14, 2005, page A12. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301720.html http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301720.html], retrieved June 26, 2005.</ref> The resolution was passed on a voice vote with 80 senators cosponsoring. The resolution expressed "the deepest sympathies and most solemn regrets of the Senate to the descendants of victims of lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity and the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the United States."

== Statistics ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ku Klux Klan]] -->
Tuskegee Institute, which is today known as Tuskegee University, is the institution that has been recognized as the official expert charged with documenting lynching since 1882, and has defined conditions that constitute a recognized lynching: 
:"There must be legal evidence that a person was ''killed''. That person must have met death ''illegally.'' A group of ''three or more persons'' must have participated in the killing. The group must have acted under the ''pretext of service to Justice, Race, or Tradition."''
Tuskegee remains the single complete source of statistics and records on this crime since 1882, and is the source for all other compiled statistics. As of 1959, which was the last time that their annual Lynch Report was published, a total of 4,733 persons had died as a result of lynching since 1882. To quote the report, 
:"Except for 1955, when three lynchings were reported in Mississippi, none has been recorded at Tuskegee since 1951. In 1945, 1947, and 1951, only one case per year was reported. The most recent case reported by the institute as a lynching was that of Emmett Till, 14, a Negro who was beaten, shot to death, and thrown into a river at [[Greenwood, Mississippi]] on [[August 28]], [[1955]]... For a period of 65 years ending in 1947, at least one lynching was reported each year. The most for any year was 231 in 1892. From 1882 to 1901, lynchings averaged more than 150 a year. Since 1924, lynchings have been in a marked decline, never more than 30 cases, which occurred in 1926...."<ref name="1926...">1959 Tuskegee Institute lynch Report as reported in the Montgomery Advertiser; April 26, 1959, and published in '''''100 Years Of Lynching''' by Ralph Ginzburg (1962, 1988).</ref>

The following graph gives the number of lynchings and racially motivated murders in each decade from 1865 to 1965. Data for 1865-1869 and 1960-1965 are partial decades.
<ref name="lynching-numbers">data compiled from [http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/lynching_century.htm http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/lynching_century.htm], retrieved June 26, 2005</ref>

[[Image:Lynchings-graph.png|frame|250px|center|Lynchings and racially-motivated murders in each decade from 1865 to 1965]]

The same source gives the following statistics for the period from 1882 to 1951. Eighty-eight percent of victims were black and 10% were white. Fifty-nine percent of the lynchings occurred in the Southern states of [[Kentucky]] (neutral in the Civil War), [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]].  Lynching was not uncommon in the West and Midwest but was virtually nonexistent in the northeast, except for isolated instances. 

The most common reasons given by mobs for the lynchings were murder and rape.  As documented by Ida B. Wells, such charges were often pretexts for lynching blacks who violated [[Jim Crow]] etiquette or engaged in economic competition with whites.  Other common reasons given included arson, theft, assault, and robbery; sexual transgressions ([[miscegenation]], adultery, cohabitation); "race prejudice," "race hatred," "racial disturbance;" informing on others; "threats against whites;" and violations of the color line ("attending white girl," "proposals to white woman").

Tuskegee's method of categorizing most lynching victims as either black or white in publications and data summaries meant that the mistreatment of some minority and immigrant groups was obscured. In the West, for instance, Mexican, Native Americans, and Chinese were more frequent targets of lynchings than African Americans, but their deaths were included among those of whites. Similarly, although Italian immigrants were the focus of violence in Louisiana when they started arriving in greater numbers, their deaths were not identified separately.  In earlier years whites who were subject to lynching were often targeted because of suspected political activities or support of freedmen, but they were generally considered members of the community in a way new immigrants were not.

== Popular culture ==
=== Famous fictional treatments ===
In ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]'', a seminal novel that helped create the genre of [[American Old West|Western]] [[novel]]s in the U.S., the protagonist participates in the lynching of an admitted cattle thief, who had been his close friend, during the [[Johnson County War]].  The lynching is represented as a necessary response to the government's corruption and lack of action, but the protagonist feels it to be a horrible duty.  He is especially stricken by the bravery with which the thief faces his fate, and the heavy burden it places on his heart forms the emotional core of the story.

Following the commercial and critical success of ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', African American director and writer [[Oscar Micheaux]] responded in 1919 with ''[[Within Our Gates]]''. The climax of the film is the lynching of a black family after one member of the family is wrongly accused of murder. While the film was a commercial failure at the time and was technically crude, it is considered historically significant and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].

In ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', Tom Robinson, a black man wrongfully accused of rape, narrowly escapes lynching because of his lawyer's bravery, and the disarmingly innocent behavior of the lawyer's daughter. The lawyer tells his daughter that he is not angry at the mob, because once the feeling of mob violence gets into people, they do not act normally. Robinson is later killed while attempting to escape from prison, after having been wrongfully convicted.

In ''[[Fury (1936 movie)|Fury]]'', German expatriate [[Fritz Lang]] depicts a lynch mob hanging innocent men, apparently modeled on a [[Brooke Hart|1933 lynching]] in [[San Jose, California]], that was captured on [[newsreel]] footage and in which [[Governor of California]] [[James Rolph]] refused to intervene.

In ''[[The Ox-Bow Incident]]'', two drifters are drawn into a posse formed to find the murderer of a local man, and suspicion centers on three innocent cattle [[rustler]]s who are then lynched, deeply affecting the drifters. The novel was filmed in 1943 as a wartime defense of American values versus the characterization of [[Third Reich|Nazi Germany]] as mob rule.

[[Regina M. Anderson]]'s ''Climbing Jacob's Ladder'' was a play performed by the [[Krigwa players]], a Harlem theater company, about a lynching.  Several lynchings are depicted in [[Peter Matthiessen]]'s ''Killing Mr. Watson'' trilogy.

[[Lynd Ward]]'s 1932 book ''Wild Pilgrimage'' (printed in woodblock prints, with no text) includes three prints of the lynching of several black men.

In [[Irving Berlin]]'s 1933 musical ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'', a ballad about lynching, "[[Supper Time]]" was introduced by [[Ethel Waters]].  Waters wrote in her 1951 autobiography, ''His Eye Was on the Sparrow'', "if one song could tell the story of an entire race, that was it."

==="Strange Fruit"===
Among artistic works that grappled with lynching was the song "[[Strange Fruit]]", recorded by [[Billie Holiday]] and written by [[Abel Meeropol]] in 1939 (lyrics protected by copyright).

Although Holiday's regular label of Columbia declined, Holiday recorded it with Commodore. The song became identified with her and was one of her most popular ones.  The song became an anthem for the anti-lynching movement.  It also contributed to activism of the [[American civil rights movement]]. A documentary about lynching, entitled ''[http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/strangefruit/ Strange Fruit]'' and produced by Public Broadcasting Service, aired on U.S. television.

==Laws==
For most of the history of the United States, lynching was rarely prosecuted, as the same people who would have had to prosecute were generally on the side of the action. When it was prosecuted, it was under state murder statutes. In one example in  1907-09, the U.S. Supreme Court tried its only criminal case in history, {{ussc|203|563|[[United States v. Shipp|U.S. v. Sheriff Shipp]]}}. Shipp was found guilty of criminal contempt for lynching Ed Johnson in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].

Starting in 1909, legislators introduced more than 200 bills to make lynching a Federal crime, but they failed to pass, chiefly because of Southern legislators' opposition. Under the Franklin D. Roosevelt Administration, the Civil Rights Section of the Justice Department tried, but failed, to prosecute lynchers under Reconstruction-era civil rights laws.  The first successful Federal prosecution of a lyncher for a civil rights violation was in 1946.  By that time, the era of lynchings as a common occurrence had ended. 

Many states now have specific anti-lynching statutes. California, for example, defines lynching, punishable by 2-4 years in prison, as "the taking by means of a riot of any person from the lawful custody of any peace officer," with the crime of "riot" defined as two or more people using violence or the threat of violence. A lyncher could thus be prosecuted for several crimes arising from the same action, e.g., riot, lynching, and murder. Although lynching in the historic sense is virtually nonexistent today, the lynching statutes are sometimes used in cases where several people try to wrest a suspect from the hands of police in order to help him escape, as alleged in a [[July 9]], [[2005]], violent attack on a police officer in San Francisco.<ref name="anarchist-attack">[http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/news/070905_nw_officer_injured.html http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/news/070905_nw_officer_injured.html], retrieved July 13, 2005.</ref> 

South Carolina law defines second degree lynching as "[a]ny act of violence inflicted by a mob upon the body of another person and from which death does not result shall constitute the crime of lynching in the second degree and shall be a felony. Any person found guilty of lynching in the second degree shall be confined at hard labor in the State Penitentiary for a term not exceeding twenty years nor less than three years, at the discretion of the presiding judge."<ref name="South Carolina law">South Carolina Code of Laws section 16-3-220 ''Lynching in the second degree'' http://www.scstatehouse.net/code/t16c003.htm#16-3-220, retrieved October 27, 2007.</ref> In 2006, five white teenagers were given various sentences for the second degree lynching of a young black man in South Carolina. <ref name="Gaffney Ledger">Guilty:Teens enter pleas in lynching case http://www.gaffneyledger.com/news/2006/0111/front_page/001.html, retrieved June 29, 2007.</ref>
