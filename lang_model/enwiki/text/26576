In production and development, '''open source''' is a [[philosophy]], or [[Pragmatism|pragmatic methodology]] that promotes free redistribution and access to an end product's design and implementation details{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Before the phrase ''open source'' became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of terms for the concept; ''open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]], and the attendant need for massive retooling of the computing [[source code]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weber|2004}}</ref> Opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive communities.<ref>The complexity of such communication relates to [[Brooks' law]], and it is also described by [[Eric S. Raymond]], "Brooks predicts that as your number of programmers N rises, work performed scales as N but complexity and vulnerability to bugs rises as N-squared. N-squared tracks the number of communications paths (and potential code interfaces) between developers' code bases."{{spaced ndash}}[http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-revenge.html "The Revenge of the Hackers"]. 2000.</ref>
The [[open-source software movement]] arose to clarify the environment that the new [[copyright]], [[licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues created.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Generally, open source refers to a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design. Open source code is typically created as a collaborative effort in which programmers improve upon the code and share the changes within the community. Open source sprouted in the technological community as a response to proprietary software owned by corporations.

The open-source model includes the concept of concurrent yet different agendas and differing approaches in production, in contrast with more centralized models of [[Software developer|development]] such as those typically used in commercial software companies.<ref>[[Eric S. Raymond|Raymond, Eric S.]] {{cite book|author=Eric S.

A main principle and practice of [[open-source software development]] is [[peer production]] by bartering and collaboration, with the end-product, source-material, "[[blueprints]]", and documentation available at no cost to the public.

==History==
{{Main|History of free and open-source software}}
{{bad summary}}

The concept of free sharing of technological information existed long before computers. For example, cooking recipes have been shared since the beginning of human culture.

In the early years of automobile development, a group of capital [[monopoly|monopolists]] owned the rights to a [[2 cycle|2-cycle]] gasoline engine patent originally filed by [[George B. Selden]].<ref name="carculture">{{cite book |author=James J. Flink |title=The Car Culture |publisher=MIT Press |year=1977 |isbn=0-262-56015-1 }}</ref>
By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit. In 1911, independent automaker [[Henry Ford]] won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the [[Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association]]) was formed.<ref name="carculture" />
The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US auto manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money between all the manufacturers.<ref name="carculture" />
By the time the US entered World War 2, 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared between these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).<ref name="carculture" />

Very similar {{vague|date=January 2012}} to [[open standards]], researchers with access to [[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) used a process called [[Request for Comments]] to develop telecommunication network protocols. This collaborative process of the 1960s led to the birth of the [[Internet]] in 1969.

Early instances of the free sharing of source code include [[IBM]]'s source releases of its [[operating system]]s and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software.<ref>{{cite book |last= Fisher|first=Franklin M. |coauthors=James W. McKie, Richard B. Mancke |title= IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History|publisher= Praeger|year =1983 |isbn =0-03-063059-2 |pages=172<U+2013>9}}
IBM unbundled (began charging for) software June 23, 1969</ref><ref>[http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html Dave Pitts' IBM 7090 support]{{spaced ndash}}An example of distributed source: Page contains a link to [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS]] source, including [[COBOL]] and [[FORTRAN]] compilers.</ref>

In a foreshadowing of the Internet, software with source code included became available on [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] networks in the 1980s. This was sometimes a necessity; distributing software written in [[BASIC]] and other [[interpreted language]]s can only be distributed as source code as there is no separate portable executable binary to distribute.

Example of BBS systems and networks that gathered source code, and setup up boards specifically to discuss its modification includes [[WWIV]], developed initially in BASIC by [[Wayne Bell (computer specialist)|Wayne Bell]]. A culture of "modding" his software and distributing the mods, grew up so extensively that when the software was ported to first [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], then [[C++]], its source code continued to be distributed to registered users, who would share mods and compile their own versions of the software.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This may have contributed to its being a dominant system and network, despite being outside the [[Fidonet]] umbrella that was shared by so many other BBS makers.

The sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via [[UUCP]], [[Usenet]], and [[irc]], and [[gopher (protocol)|gopher]]. [[BSD]], for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed.  [[Linux]] followed in this model.

The label "open source" was adopted by a group of people in the [[free software]] movement at a strategy session<ref name=osihistory>{{cite web

The group of individuals at the session included [[Christine Peterson]] who suggested "open source", Todd Anderson, [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]], Sam Ockman, [[Michael Tiemann]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. Over the next week, Raymond and others worked on spreading the word. [[Linus Torvalds]] gave an all-important sanction the following day. Phil Hughes offered a pulpit in ''[[Linux Journal]]''. [[Richard Stallman]], pioneer of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.<ref name=osihistory/><ref name="rmsdissent">{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |publisher=fsf.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref> Those people who adopted the term used the opportunity before the release of Navigator's source code to free themselves from the ideology of the term "free software".

In February 1998, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.<ref name="raymondCall">{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> The [[Open Source Initiative]] was formed shortly thereafter by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens.<ref name=osihistory/>

The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]]. Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",<ref name=opensourcesummit>{{cite web|url=http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html |title=Open Source Summit LG #28 |publisher=Linuxgazette.net |date=1998-04-10 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>
The event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Eric Allman]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Paul Vixie]], [[Jamie Zawinski]] of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source." The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. 

Starting in the early 2000s, a number of companies began to publish a portion of their source code to claim they were open source, while keeping key parts closed. This led to the development of the now widely used terms ''[[free open source software|free open-source software]]'' and ''[[commercial open-source software]]'' to distinguish between truly open and hybrid forms of open source.{{Or|date=January 2010}}

==Economic analysis==
{{main|Open-source economics}}
Most economists agree that open-source candidates have an [[information good]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Granstrand|first=Ove|title=The economics and management of intellectual property : towards intellectual capitalism|year=1999|publisher=E. Elgar|location=Cheltenham, UK|isbn=1-85898-967-1}}</ref> (also termed "knowledge good") aspect. In general, this suggests that the original work involves a great deal of time, money, and effort. However, the cost of reproducing the work is very low, so that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost{{spaced ndash}}this is referred to as the [[marginal cost]] of a product. [[Copyright]] creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production.  This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work, without needing to find a single customer that can bear the entire cost.  Conventional copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a [[derivative work]] - such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a [[remix]] of a song - but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so.

Being organized effectively as a [[consumers' cooperative]], the idea of open source is to eliminate the access costs of the consumer and the creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright.  Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works.  Additionally some proponents argue that open source also relieves society of the administration and enforcement costs of copyright.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Organizations such as [[Creative Commons]] have websites where individuals can file for alternative "licenses", or levels of restriction, for their works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/ |title=About The Licenses |publisher=Creative Commons |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>
These self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement. Thus, on several fronts, there is an efficiency argument to be made on behalf of open-sourced goods.

However, others argue that because consumers do not pay for the copies, creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production, and thus have no economic incentive to create in the first place.  By this argument, consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available at all. In practice, content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies, or an open license. Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development, such as the [[pharmaceutical industry]] (which depends largely on [[patent]]s, not copyright for intellectual property protection) are almost exclusively proprietary.

Alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary model.  Examples include:

* Creation for its own sake - for example, [[Wikipedia]] editors add content to satisfy their own curiosity or because they are bored.  Artists have a drive to create.  Both communities benefit from free starting material.
* Voluntary after-the-fact donations - used by [[shareware]], [[street performer]]s, and [[public broadcasting]] in the United States.
* Patron - For example, [[open access]] publishing relies on institutional and government funding of research faculty, who also have a professional incentive to publish for reputation and career advancement.  Works of the U.S. federal government are automatically released into the [[public domain]].
* [[Freemium]] - Give away a limited version for free and charge for a premium version (perhaps using a [[dual license]])
* Give away the product and charge for something related - charge for support of open-source [[enterprise software]], give away music but charge for concert admission 
* Give away work in order to gain market share - used by artists, in corporate software to spoil a dominant competitor (for example in the [[browser wars]] and the [[Android operating system]])
* For own use - Businesses or individual software developers often create software to solve a problem, bearing the full cost of initial creation.  They will then open source the solution, and benefit from the improvements others make for their own needs.  Communalizing the maintenance burden distributes the cost across more users; [[free rider problem|free riders]] can also benefit without undermining the creation process.

===Case study===
An investigation of open-source [[industrial symbiosis]] was performed by Doyle and Pearce using [[Google Earth]]. Their paper<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~pearce/papers/2009%20OES%20Doyle%20Open%20source%20IS.pdf |title="Utilization of Virtual Globes for Open Source Industrial Symbiosis"] from Pearce Research Group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]|publisher=Mse.mtu.edu|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> found that [[virtual globe]]s coupled with open-source waste information can be used to:

# Reduce [[embodied energy]] of transport by reducing distances to recycling facilities
# Choose end-of-life at recycling facilities rather than landfills
# Establish industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks on known by-product synergies

==Applications==
Many fields of study and social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. But [[Eric Raymond]] and other founders of the open-source movement have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling. The broader impact of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.

The open-source movement has inspired increased [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and liberty in [[biotechnology]] research, for example by [[CAMBIA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/470.html |title='Open-Source Practices for Biotechnology' - Cambia - Enabling Innovation |publisher=Cambia |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua M.|title=Open Source Research in Sustainability|journal=Sustainability: the Journal of Record|date=1 August 2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=238<U+2013>243|doi=10.1089/sus.2012.9944}}</ref> It has also given rise to the rapidly expanding [[open-source hardware]] movement. In the book ''[[Democratizing Innovation]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=10446 |title=The MIT Press &#124; 50 years of publishing |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> it is argued that a trend toward democratized innovation in physical products (e.g. open-source hardware) is occurring like the free and open-source software movement, and that the difference between [[crowdsourcing]] and open source is that open-source production is a cooperative activity initiated and voluntarily undertaken by members of the public. One of the primary geographically diverse communities that is utilizing this developmental method is the scientific community; using open-source hardware to reduce the cost of scientific equipment.<ref>Pearce, Joshua M. 2012. <U+201C>[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1303.summary Building Research Equipment with Free, Open-Source Hardware.]<U+201D> ''Science'' '''337''' (6100): 1303<U+2013>1304.[http://mtu.academia.edu/JoshuaPearce/Papers/1867941/Open_Source_Research_in_Sustainability open access]</ref>

==Society and culture==
{{duplication}}
{{Original research|discuss=Talk:Open-source#History of the term 2|date=May 2012}}
Open-source culture is the creative practice of appropriation and free sharing of found and created content. Examples include [[collage]], [[found footage]] film, music, and [[appropriation art]]. Open-source culture is one in which fixations, works entitled to copyright protection, are made generally available. Participants in the culture can modify those products and redistribute them back into the community or other organizations.

The rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve appropriation, and therefore require access to content that is often [[copyright]]ed, and increasingly restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the [[United States]]) and penalties, such as those articulated in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf |title=The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>

Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under [[fair use|fair-use]] doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a "[[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]]" among cultural practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/ |title=Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>

In the late 20th century, cultural practitioners began to adopt the intellectual property licensing techniques of free software and open-source software to make their work more freely available to others, including the [[Creative Commons]].

The idea of an "open-source" culture runs parallel to "[[Free Culture movement|Free Culture]]," but is substantively different. ''Free culture'' is a term derived from the [[free software movement]], and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in "the Good life") and ends.

One way of achieving the goal of making the fixations of cultural work generally available is to maximally utilize technology and [[digital media]]. In keeping with [[Moore's law]]'s prediction about processors, the cost of digital media and storage plummeted in the late 20th Century. Consequently, the [[marginal cost]] of digitally duplicating anything capable of being transmitted via digital media dropped to near zero. Combined with an explosive growth in [[personal computer]] and technology ownership, the result is an increase in general population's access to digital media. This phenomenon facilitated growth in open-source culture because it allowed for rapid and inexpensive duplication and distribution of culture. Where the access to the majority of culture produced prior to the advent of digital media was limited by other constraints of proprietary and potentially "open" mediums, digital media is the latest technology with the potential to increase access to cultural products. Artists and users who choose to distribute their work digitally face none of the physical limitations that traditional cultural producers have been typically faced with. Accordingly, the audience of an open-source culture faces little physical cost in acquiring digital media.

Open-source culture precedes [[Richard Stallman]]'s codification of free software with the creation of the [[Free Software movement]]. As the public began to communicate through [[Bulletin Board Systems]] (BBS) like [[FidoNet]], places like Sourcery Systems BBS were dedicated to providing source code to [[Public Domain]], [[Shareware]] and [[Freeware]] programs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Essentially born out of a desire for increased general access to digital media, [[Internet|the Internet]] is open-source culture's most valuable asset. It is questionable whether the goals of an open-source culture could be achieved without the Internet. The global network not only fosters an environment where culture can be generally accessible, but also allows for easy and inexpensive redistribution of culture back into various communities. Some reasons for this are as follows.

First, the Internet allows even greater access to inexpensive digital media and storage. Instead of users being limited to their own facilities and resources, they are granted access to a vast network of facilities and resources, some free. Sites such as [[ccMixter]] offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a [[Creative Commons]] license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Open source software development{{spaced ndash}}Just another case of collective invention?|url=http://ccmixter.org/about|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fccmixter.org%2Fabout&date=2011-12-22|archivedate=2011-12-22}}</ref>  Second, users are granted unprecedented access to each other. Older analog technologies such as the [[telephone]] or [[television]] have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have. In the case of television there is little, if any interaction between users participating on the network. And in the case of the telephone, users rarely interact with any more than a couple of their known peers. On the Internet, however, users have the potential to access and meet millions of their peers. This aspect of the Internet facilitates the modification of culture as users are able to collaborate and communicate with each other across international and cultural boundaries. The speed in which digital media travels on the Internet in turn facilitates the redistribution of culture.

Through various technologies such as [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[blogs]], cultural producers can take advantage of vast [[social networks]] to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Gnutella]] take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.

===Government===
* [[Open politics]] (sometimes known as ''Open-source politics'') is a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs, email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters. There is also an alternative conception of the term ''Open-source politics'' which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the open-source software movement.
* [[Open-source governance]] is similar to open-source politics, but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information.

===Ethics===
Open-source ethics is split into two strands:
* Open-source ethics as an ethical school{{spaced ndash}}Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an open-source approach. Ess famously even defined the AoIR Research Guidelines as an example of open-source ethics.<ref>[http://flosshub.org/sites/flosshub.org/files/berry2.pdf Berry (2004) Internet Ethics: Privacy, Ethics and Alienation{{spaced ndash}}An Open Source Approach.] (PDF file)</ref>
* Open-source ethics as a professional body of rules{{spaced ndash}}This is based principally on the computer ethics school, studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular.<ref>{{cite journal |author=El-Emam, K |title=Ethics and Open Source |journal=Empirical Software Engineering |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=2001 |url=http://springerlink.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=hf0bld3qlk0unn8f8x2m&referrer=parent&backto=issue,2,12;journal,14,33;linkingpublicationresults,1:100262,1#ContactOfAuthor1}}</ref>

===Media===
[[Open-source journalism]] formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, reflecting ''[[open-source intelligence]]'' a similar term used in military intelligence circles. Now, ''open-source journalism'' commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of [[online journalism]], rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the December 25, 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as [[user generated content|user created content]] and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Linux]].

[[Blog|Weblogs]], or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or [[file transfer]] required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as [[LiveJournal]] or [[WordPress]], utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes "open sourcing" even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.

[[Messageboards]] are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are [[spamming|spammers]]. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use [[phpBB]], which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life{{spaced ndash}}for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.

[[OpenDocument]] is an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being [[Vendor lock-in|locked into]] a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their [[software license|licensing]] terms to something less favorable.

[[Open source film|Open-source movie production]] is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie [[Elephants Dream]] is said to be the "world's first open movie",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantsdream.org/ |title=Elephants Dream |publisher=Elephants Dream |date=2006-08-13 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> created entirely using [[open-source technology]].

An open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material, [[footage]], and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit "[[The American Revolution]]," which went into production in 2005, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.<ref>"Web Power to the People," The Boston Herald, September 29, 2005</ref><ref>"The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston," Boston Globe, Op-Ed, July 18, 2009.</ref><ref>"'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors," Boston Herald, August 11, 2009</ref><ref>"WBCN and The American Revolution," The Huffington Post, August 11, 2009</ref> The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative. Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca |title=Watch Documentaries and Animated Films Online |publisher=NFB.ca |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>
[[Open source film|Open-source film-making]] refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a film-maker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.

[[Open-IPTV]] is [[IPTV]] that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.

===Education===
Within the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the "intellectual commons" (analogous to the [[Creative Commons]]). Proponents of this view have hailed the [[Connexions]] Project at [[Rice University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare]] project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Eugene Thacker]]'s article on "open-source DNA", the "Open Source Cultural Database", [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]]'s [[Khan Academy]] and [[Wikipedia]] as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.

[[Open-source curriculum|Open-source curricula]] are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.

Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the [[Jisc|Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)]] has developed a policy on open-source software. JISC also funds a development service called [[OSS Watch]] which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open-source software.

===Innovation communities===
The principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] described the four basic elements of the community{{spaced ndash}}universalism (an international perspective), communalism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today. These principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]]{{spaced ndash}}the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The Budapest Open Access Initiative is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet. The [[National Institutes of Health]] has recently proposed a policy on "Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information." This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered{{spaced ndash}}the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.

Farmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farmavita.net/content/view/336/84/ |title=Pharmaceutical Licensing Network - Open Source Pharmaceuticals - New Business Model |publisher=Farmavita.Net |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref> The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs. It will be limited to generic (off-patent) medicines with established use. By the definition, medicinal product have a "well-established use" if is used for at least 15 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In that event, the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals]], and the [[lightning rod]] to the public domain.

New NGO communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool. One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members.<ref>[http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

[[Open innovation]] is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting R&D in a common pool. The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/membersminutes/20070920MembersMeeting/07.09.12-Eclipse-Open-Innovation.pdf |title=Eclipse|publisher=Eclipse.org|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>

===Arts and recreation===
Copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities. Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yogaunity.org |title=Open Source Yoga Unity - Home |publisher=Yogaunity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>
