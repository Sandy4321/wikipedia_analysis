Interdisciplinary research conducted at UH includes [[superconductivity]], space commercialization, [[biomedical engineering]], economics, education, petroleum exploration, and virtual technology.

==History==
===Founding===
The University of Houston began as Houston Junior College (HJC).  On [[March 7]], [[1927]], trustees of the [[Houston Independent School District]] [[Board of Education]] unanimously passed a resolution that authorized the founding and operating of a junior college.  The junior college was operated and controlled by the [[Houston Independent School District]] (HISD).<ref name="Handbook of Texas">[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/UU/kcu3.html University of Houston-University Park]. Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved 16 October 2007.</ref><ref name="Homecoming 2007 Timeline">[http://www.advancement.uh.edu/homecoming/2007/timeline.htm UH Timeline]. University of Houston. Retrieved 16 October 2007.</ref>

Originally HJC was located in [[San Jacinto High School]] and offered only night courses.<ref name="UH Through Time: Events">[http://info.lib.uh.edu/sca/digital/time/events.html UH Through Time: Events]. University of Houston Libraries. Retrieved 16 October 2007.</ref>  Its first session began [[March 7]], [[1927]], with an enrollment of 232 students and 12 faculty.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" />  This session was primarily held to educate the future teachers of the junior college, and no freshmen were allowed to enroll.  A more accurate date for the official opening of HJC is [[September 19]], [[1927]], when enrollment was opened to all persons having completed the necessary educational requirements.<ref name="Roarin 07">[http://www.mycougarconnection.com/homecoming/history.htm Discover UH's Heritage & History].  UH Alumni Organization. Retrieved 16 October 2007.</ref>  The first president of HJC was Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer, who was the dominant force in establishing the [[junior college]].<ref name="Handbook of Texas" />

===University beginnings===
[[Image:University of Houston in 1934.jpg|thumb|left|The University of Houston administrative offices at [[San Jacinto High School]] in 1934]]
The junior college became eligible to become a [[university|four-year institution]] in October 1933 when Governor Miriam A. Ferguson signed House Bill 194 into law.  On [[April 30]], [[1934]], HISD's Board of Education adopted a resolution to make the school a four-year institution, and Houston Junior College became the University of Houston.<ref name="Roarin 07" />

UH's first session as a four-year institution began [[June 4]], [[1934]], at San Jacinto High School with an enrollment of 682. In 1934, the first campus of the University of Houston was established at the Second Baptist Church at Milam and McGowen.  The next fall, the campus was moved to the South Main Baptist Church, on Main between Richmond and Eagle, where it stayed for the next five years.<ref name="Roarin 07" />

The University of Houston moved to its present campus in 1939. Its first building, the Roy Gustav Cullen Building, was dedicated on [[June 4]], [[1939]], and classes began the next day.  The first full semester of classes began officially on Wednesday, [[September 20]], [[1939]].<ref name="Roarin 07" />

The next step was the creation of the University of Houston as an institution separate from HISD. On [[July 26]], [[1943]], the Board of Education adopted a resolution establishing an Advisory Board of the University of Houston consisting of 15 members. On [[March 12]], [[1945]], Senate Bill 207 was signed into law, removing the control of the University of Houston from HISD and placing it into the hands of 15 HISD-approved regents.<ref name="Roarin 07" /> In 1945, the university, which had grown too large and complex for
the Houston school board to administer, became a private school. In March 1947, the regents authorized creation of a School of Law at the University, now called the UH Law Center. In 1949, a gift of $1.5 million from the M. D. Anderson Foundation for erection of a library building for UH. By 1950, the educational plant at UH consisted of 12 permanent buildings. Enrollment was more than 14,000 with a full-time faculty of more than 300.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" />

===State university===
[[Image:UH Religion Center.jpg|thumb|The [[A.D. Bruce]] Religion Center was named after the former President of UH]]
In 1953, the University established [[KUHT]], the first educational [[television]] station in the nation.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" /> During this period, however, the university as a private institution was facing financial troubles. Tuition failed to cover rising costs, and in turn, tuition increases caused a drop in enrollment. After a lengthy battle between supporters of the University of Houston, led by school president [[A.D. Bruce]],<ref name="txarchives">[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uhua/00001/hua-00001.html A.D. Bruce Speeches Collection, 1954-1961]. Texas Archival Resources Online. Retrieved 25 June 2007.</ref> and forces from [[state university|state universities]] geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on [[May 23]], [[1961]], enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" />

In 1977, the [[University of Houston System]] was established, with the University of Houston named as its flagship university.<ref name="UH at a Glance" />  The University of Houston was known as University of Houston&ndash;University Park from 1985 to 1988. This name change was an effort by the UH administration to give the flagship institution of the University of Houston System a distinctive name that would eliminate confusion with the other three UHS universities. While these three universities ([[University of Houston<U+2013>Downtown|UH<U+2013>Downtown]], [[University of Houston<U+2013>Clear Lake|UH<U+2013>Clear Lake]], and [[University of Houston<U+2013>Victoria|UH<U+2013>Victoria]]) share the root name "University of Houston," they are essentially autonomous institutions, and they each have their own president.

===Modern day===
In 1997, the UH System and the University of Houston administrations merged. That same year, Arthur K. Smith became the first person to hold both the UH System chancellorship and University of Houston presidency simultaneously. Smith was responsible for overseeing the successful merger of the UH System and UH administrations, the launching of the "Learning. Leading." image campaign, the planning and construction of major buildings at all UH System universities, a growth in external funding for research, and an increase in student enrollment.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uh.edu/admin/media/newsroom/announcement/presidents1.html | title = University of Houston Presidents | publisher = University of Houston System | accessdate = 2007-10-16 }}</ref>

As of 1997, the University of Houston System administration is located in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building on the University of Houston campus. On [[June 1]], [[2007]], former UH President and Chancellor Dr. Jay Gogue left UH and UH System to become President of [[Auburn University]]. The University of Houston System Board of Regents appointed John M. Rudley, vice chancellor/vice president for administration and finance, to serve as Interim UH System Chancellor and Interim UH President.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uh.edu/admin/media/nr/2007/05may/051707johnrudleyinterimleader.html | title = John Rudley Named as Interim Leader of UH and UH System | publisher = University of Houston | accessdate = 2007-10-16 }}</ref>

After months of searching, on [[October 15]], [[2007]], Dr. Renu Khator, who had served as the provost and senior vice president at the [[University of South Florida]], was selected for the position of UH System chancellor and UH president.<ref name="Noted Political Science Scholar">{{cite web | title=Scholar and Administrator Selected as Sole Nominee

At the game, members of the opposing team discovered what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent.  UT went on to win this game 28-7, and UH students began using the sign as notice that they would remember the taunts.  In 1968, at their second meeting, the Cougars, holding up the now-adopted symbol of UH pride, played UT to a 20-20 tie. UH did not play UT again until 1976, the first year UH was a member of the [[Southwest Conference]].  In front of a record crowd, UH defeated UT 30-0.  This solidified the use of the Cougar Paw as a tradition.<ref name="Traditions" />
