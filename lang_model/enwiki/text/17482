'''Apple Springs''' is a small [[unincorporated area|unincorporated town]] in [[Trinity County, Texas|Trinity County]], [[Texas]], [[United States]].  The town was founded shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] as May Apple Springs.  The town rose to a population of 285 in 1965, and then progressively declined to about 130 people, with nine business, in the 1990s.

==Schools==
Apple Springs is home to [[Apple Springs Independent School District]].  The district has two schools, Apple Springs Elementary School (pre-kindergarten to grade 6) and [[Apple Springs High School]] (grades 7 to 12), with approximately 140-165 students. In 2004-2005, the school district received an "Academically Acceptable" rating from the Texas Education Agency (TEA). In 2002, Apple Springs High School was recognized by ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' one of the top ten high schools in Texas in its economic group, based on ranking by the National Center for Educational Accountability.

==History==
Trinity County history began in 1852 when Jonathon Roach left his wife Mary Boone Roach and their children at Sumpter Texas while he captained river boats on the Trinity River. Although he died 2 years later, Mary stayed there until their boys returned from the Civil War. Unable to bear the reconstruction, they moved to the deep woods of North Cedar near Burketown. One of their sons, Thomas was knowledgeable about medicine and could tell time day or night without a watch. He was a good farmer and acquired enough land to provide "extras" for his family.
Around 1900, the Southern Pine Lumber Co. built a train road from Diboll into North Cedar and built 2 camps along the road. One of these camps was near some natural springs that were surrounded by May Apple Bushes (a name give to Bois D'Arc trees). The area came to be known as May Apple Springs (When a post office opened in 1884 the name was shortened to Apple Springs). The camps were self contained units with stores, blacksmith shops, and ice houses.

When the camp closed in WWI, they sold the section houses and house cars to "locals". The Apple Springs Telephone Co was formed by William Warren and later purchased by Burr Roach. His brother owned a store and sent 6 of his 7 children to college. Several local boys served in WWI and, upon their return, prohibition came making  moonshine brewing and bootlegging commonplace. In fact, North Cedar on a Mason Jur meant as much as  "four roses" on a bottle. 
During this time, schools held box suppers, churches held "preachings" and singing schools. People with large houses held dances. Henry Hrville was the most popular "caller" of the square dances and started his calls with "Partners in you places like horses in their traces - if I live a hundred year, I hope I die a-pullin' in the gear!"
WWII brought more changes as people found work away from the land, but money was still scarce. Many people said they couldn't tell much change from The Depression.
