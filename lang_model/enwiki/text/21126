'''''The Mummy''''' is a 1999 American  [[adventure film]] written and directed by [[Stephen Sommers]] and starring [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Rachel Weisz]], [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] and [[Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)|Kevin J. O'Connor]], with [[Arnold Vosloo]] in the title role as the reanimated [[mummy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v179644|work=Allmovie|title=The Mummy|accessdate=December 8, 2012|author=Deming, Mark|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]}}</ref> It is a loose remake of [[The Mummy (1932 film)|the 1932 film of the same name]] which starred [[Boris Karloff]] in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror series, the film eventually grew into a [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] adventure film.

Filming began in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]], on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the [[Sahara]]. The visual effects were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], who blended film and [[computer-generated imagery]] to create the titular Mummy. [[Jerry Goldsmith]] provided the orchestral score.

''The Mummy'' opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43&nbsp;million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; the film went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a [[2001 in film|2001]] sequel, ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'', as well as ''[[The Mummy: The Animated Series]]'', and the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. Seven years later, the third installment, ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'', opened on August 1, [[2008 in film|2008]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] also opened a [[roller coaster]], ''[[Revenge of the Mummy]]'', in 2004. [[Novelization]]s of the film and its sequels were written by [[Max Allan Collins]].

==Plot==
In [[Thebes, Egypt]], 1290 BC, high priest [[Imhotep (character)|Imhotep]] engaged in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti I]]. When the Pharaoh discovered their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murdered the monarch. As Seti's guards arrive, Imhotep fled while Anck-su-Namun [[Suicide|killed herself]], intending for Imhotep to [[resurrect]] her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep and his priests stole her corpse and travelled to [[Hamunaptra]], the city of the dead, where they began the resurrection ceremony. However, they were intercepted by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed and Anck-su-Namun's soul was sent back to the Underworld. Imhotep's priests were [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|mummified]] alive. Imhotep was sentenced to immortal agony, condemned to suffer the Hom Dai curse, having his [[tongue]] removed and then being buried alive with flesh-eating [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetles]]. He was buried under high security, sealed away in a [[sarcophagus]] at the feet of a statue of the [[Egyptian pantheon|Egyptian god]] [[Anubis]], and kept under strict surveillance by warriors known as the [[Medjay|Medjai]]; for all humanity would be doomed should he resurface.

In 1923, well over 3000 years after Imhotep was buried, a unit of the [[French Foreign Legion]] battle with [[Tuareg_people|Tuareg]] nomads at Hamunaptra. The unit is swiftly overwhelmed, leaving only two survivors: cowardly Hungarian thief [[List of The Mummy characters#Beni Gabor|Beni Gabor]] flees, while his American friend and soldier [[List of The Mummy characters#Richard "Rick" O'Connell|Rick O'Connell]] is cornered. The nomads suddenly flee in terror when they hear sinister whispers, and Rick quickly follows them when the ground appears to come to life. Watching from afar, the [[Medjay|Medjai]], watching over the Tourages and the Legion, decide to let the desert kill O'Connell.

Three years later, [[List of The Mummy characters#Jonathan Carnahan|Jonathan Carnahan]] presents his sister [[List of The Mummy characters#Evelyn "Evie" Carnahan O'Connell|Evelyn]], a Cairo librarian and aspiring [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]], an intricate box and map which Jonathan says he found in Thebes. After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he stole it from an American adventurer, soon revealed to be Rick O'Connell, who survived the desert only to end up in prison. Evelyn and Jonathan visit Rick; he tells them that he knows the location of the city, and makes a deal with Evelyn to lead them there, once Evelyn saves him from being hanged.

Rick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where the group encounters a band of American [[treasure hunters]] led by the famed British Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni, who O'Connell is less than pleased to discover on the boat. Shortly after reaching Hamunaptra, the expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay. Ardeth warns them of the evil buried in the city, but despite his warning, the two expeditions continue to excavate in separate portions of the city. Evelyn searches for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book reportedly capable of taking life away, but comes across the remains of Imhotep instead. The team of Americans, meanwhile, discover a chest with ancient engravings that Chamberlain deciphers as saying that any and all who open the box are cursed if Imhotep is awakened. While Beni refuses to assist them and flees, the Americans open the chest to find the black [[Book of the Dead]], accompanied by [[canopic jar]]s carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs. Chamberlain steals the Book of the Dead while each of the Americans pockets a jar as loot.

At night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep. A cloud of locusts descends on the city, devouring the local diggers and trapping the two expeditions inside the pyramid. One of the Americans, Burns, is left behind in the confusion and is attacked by Imhotep, losing his eyes and tongue. The Medjai rescue Burns, and escort the expeditions back to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni, who bargains with Imhotep; the antagonist promises not to kill Beni in return. Imhotep absorbs the life from the American expedition, returning to full strength, and bringing the 10 plagues back to Egypt. Seeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum. After Evelyn reveals that Imhotep referred to her as Anck-su-Namun in Hamunaptra, Ardeth and museum curator Terrence Bay hypothesize that Imhotep wants to resurrect his lover again and will do so by sacrificing Evelyn. Evelyn muses that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him again. As they deduce the location of the Book, Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves. Evelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the lives of the rest of the group. Imhotep goes back on his word and leaves his slaves to kill the group anyway. However, Rick discovers an entrance to the sewers and they escape. Terrence sacrifices himself to buy the others time to escape.

Imhotep, Evelyn and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth. Evelyn is rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests, and she reads from the Book of Amun-Ra. Imhotep becomes mortal again and Rick stabs him, forcing him into the River of Death. Rapidly decaying, Imhotep leaves the world of the living, vowing revenge with the same words he carved into his sarcophagus, ''Death is only the beginning''. While looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand. The heroes escape, although they lose the Book of Amun-Ra in the process.  Rick and Evelyn kiss and, with Jonathan, ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.

==Production==

===Origins===
In 1992, producer James Jacks decided to update the original ''Mummy'' film for the 1990s.<ref name="Cinescape">{{cite news|title=''The Mummy'' That Wasn't|publisher=Cinescape|date=May 3, 1999}}</ref> [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] gave him the go-ahead, but only if he kept the budget around $10&nbsp;million.<ref name="Hobson">{{cite news|last=Hobson|first=Louis B|title=Universal rolls out new, improved ''Mummy''|publisher=[[Calgary Sun]]|date=May 1, 1999 }}</ref> The producer remembers that the studio "essentially wanted a low-budget horror franchise";<ref name="Hobson"/> in response, Jacks recruited horror filmmaker/writer [[Clive Barker]] on board to direct. Barker's vision for the film was violent, with the story revolving around the head of a contemporary art museum who turns out to be a cultist trying to reanimate mummies.<ref name="Cinescape"/><ref name="Slotek">{{cite news|last=Slotek|first=Jim|title=Unwrapping ''The Mummy''| publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=May 2, 1999 }}</ref> Jacks recalls that Barker's take was "dark, sexual and filled with mysticism",<ref name="Hobson"/> and that, "it would have been a great low-budget movie".<ref name="Slotek"/> After several meetings, Barker and Universal lost interest and parted company. Filmmaker [[George A. Romero]] was brought in with a vision of a zombie-style horror movie similar to ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', but this was considered too scary by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture.<ref name="Hobson"/>

[[Joe Dante]] was the next choice, increasing the budget for his idea of [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] as a brooding Mummy.<ref name="Hobson"/> This version (co-written by [[John Sayles]]) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story.<ref name="Slotek"/> It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, making it to the final product.<ref name="Cinescape"/> However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15&nbsp;million and rejected Dante's version. Soon after, [[Mick Garris]] was attached to direct but eventually left the project,<ref name="Chase">{{cite news|last=Chase|first=Donald|title=What Have They Unearthed?|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 3, 1999}}</ref> and [[Wes Craven]] was offered the film but turned it down.<ref name="Slotek"/> Then, Stephen Sommers called Jacks in 1997 with his vision of ''The Mummy'' "as a kind of [[Indiana Jones]] or ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time".<ref name="Hobson"/> Sommers had seen the original film when he was eight, and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale.<ref name="Snead">{{cite news|last=Snead|first=Elizabeth|title=Updating A Well-Preserved Villain|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=May 7, 1999}}</ref> He had wanted to make a ''Mummy'' film since 1993, but other writers or directors were always attached. Finally, Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his idea to Universal with an 18-page treatment.<ref name="Cinescape"/> At the time, Universal's management had changed in response to the box office failure of ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'', and the loss led the studio to want to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|first=Liane|last=Bonin|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84361,00.html|title=That's a Wrap|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1999-05-07|accessdate= 2008-04-01}}</ref> Universal liked this idea so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget from $15&nbsp;million to $80&nbsp;million.<ref name="Argent">{{cite news|last=Argent|first=Daniel|title=Unwrapping ''The Mummy'': An Interview with Stephen Sommers|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|year=1999}}</ref>

===Principal photography===
Filming began in [[Marrakech, Morocco]] on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17&nbsp;weeks. Photography then moved to the [[Sahara desert]] outside the small town of Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before completion of shooting on August 29, 1998.<ref name="behind">{{cite web|title=Behind the Scenes|work=The Mummy Official Site|publisher=Universal Studios|year=1999|url=http://www.mummyvideo.com/bhs/| accessdate=2007-05-24 }}</ref> The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions.<ref name="Portman">{{cite news|last=Portman|first=Jamie|title=''Mummy'' Unearths Horror, Humour|publisher=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=May 5, 1999 }}</ref> To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours.<ref name="Braund"/> Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.<ref name="Portman"/>

Brendan Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged. Weisz remembered, "He [Fraser] stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated."<ref name="Jones, Alison"/> The production had the official support of the Moroccan army, and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them,<ref name="Slotek"/> a fact Sommers disclosed to the cast only after shooting had finished.<ref name="show me 3">{{cite web|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273360_3,00.html|title=Show Me The Mummy (page 3)|author=Staff|date=1999-05-14|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2008-04-01}}</ref>

Production Designer Allan Cameron found a dormant volcano near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the location because, "A city hidden in the crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out in the middle of the desert you would never see it. You would never think of entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano."<ref name="behind"/> A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at [[Shepperton Studios]], where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes.<ref name="behind"/> Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] which doubled for the [[Giza]] Port on the [[River Nile]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1999/10/the-mummy-1999/|title=Kent Film Office The Mummy Film Focus}}</ref> This set was {{convert|600|ft|m|0}} in length and featured "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".<ref name="behind"/>

===Special effects===
The filmmakers reportedly spent $15&nbsp;million of the $80&nbsp;million budget on special effects, provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]];<ref name="modern mummy"/><ref name="Slotek2">{{cite news|last=Slotek|first=Jim|title=''Mummy'' Unwraps a New Fraser "Cartoon" Character|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=1999-05-09}}</ref> the producers wanted a new look for the Mummy so that they would avoid comparisons to past movies.<ref name="modern mummy"/> John Andrew Berton, Jr., [[Industrial Light & Magic]]'s Visual Effects Supervisor on ''The Mummy'', started developing the look three months before filming started. He said that he wanted the Mummy "to be mean, tough, nasty, something that had never been seen by audiences before". Berton used [[motion capture]] in order to achieve "a menacing and very realistic Mummy".<ref name="behind"/> Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could see exactly how he moved and replicate it.<ref name="modern mummy">{{cite journal|first=Estelle|last=Shay|title=Thoroughly modern Mummy|journal=[[Cinefex]]|date=April 1999|issue=77|pages=71<U+2013>76|quote=On the special effects used in the film, and on the company who made them, Industrial Light & Magic. }}</ref>

To create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing and you can see right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do."<ref name="behind"/> Vosloo described the filming as a "whole new thing" for him; "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree."<ref name="show me 3"/> Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.<ref name="Portman"/>

'''''The Mummy: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was composed and conducted by [[Jerry Goldsmith]], with orchestrations provided by [[Alexander Courage]].<ref name=amg/> The soundtrack was released by [[Decca Records]] on May 4, 1999.

[[Roger Ebert]], a film critic of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing "There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=''The Mummy''|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=1999-05-07|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990507/REVIEWS/905070303/1023|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref> Likewise, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B-" grade and said, "''The Mummy'' would like to make you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=''The Mummy''|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=May 7, 1999|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,64020,00.html|accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> Bob Graham of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.<ref>{{cite news|author=Graham, Bob|title='Mummy' -- It's Alive|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=1999-05-07|accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref>

[[Stephen Holden]] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "This version of ''The Mummy'' has no pretenses to be anything other than a gaudy comic video game splashed onto the screen. Think ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with cartoon characters, no coherent story line and lavish but cheesy special effects. Think ''Night of the Living Dead'' stripped of genuine horror and restaged as an Egyptian-theme Halloween pageant. Think ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' grafted onto a [[Bing Crosby]]-[[Bob Hope]] road picture (''The Road to Hamunaptra''?) and pumped up into an epic-size genre spoof."<ref>{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|title=Sarcophagus, Be Gone: Night of the Living Undead|publisher=The New York Times|date=May 7, 1999|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E0D7103CF934A35756C0A96F958260&scp=3&sq=The+Mummy&st=nyt|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref> Publications like ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' and ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' came to the conclusion that despite good acting and special effects, the movie lacked cohesion;<ref name=observer/><ref>{{cite news|author=Savlov, Mark|title=The Mummy|publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=1999-05-07|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A142860|accessdate=2008-03-12}}</ref> talking about the special effects, the ''Observer'' lamented "If only generating a soul for the film itself were so easy."<ref name=observer>{{cite news|author=Hinson, Hal|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999-05-13/film/mummy-dearest/|title=Mummy dearest|publisher=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=1999-05-07|accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> Other publications such as ''[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]'' felt that Industrial Light and Magic's lock on special effects proved detrimental to ''The Mummy''; "The mummy", Ernest Larson wrote for the ''Jump Cut'', "is standard-issue I.L.&M.".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ernest|last=Larsen|title=The Mummy: traffic in mummies|journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]]|url=http://ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/Mummy.html|date=July 2000| issue=43|pages=12<U+2013>15, 128 |accessdate=2008-04-09}}</ref> Kim Newman of the [[British Film Institute]] judged the picture inferior to the original, as all the time was spent on special effects, instead of creating the atmosphere which made the original film such a classic.<ref name="bfi"/> ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film two out of four stars and felt that it was "not free of stereotypes",<ref name="usa today"/> a sentiment with which the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] concurred.<ref name="bfi">{{cite web|author=Newman, Kim|date=1999-06-01|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/152|title=Sight and Sound: The Mummy|work=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=2008-04-04}}</ref> "If someone complains of a foul odor, you can be sure an Arab stooge is about to enter a scene.

[[Image:Mummy the Ride.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to ''[[Revenge of the Mummy (Hollywood)|Revenge of the Mummy]]'' at Universal Studios Hollywood.]]
''The Mummy''{{'}}s box office performance led to numerous sequels and spinoffs. In 2001, the sequel ''[[The Mummy Returns]]'' was released; the film features most of the surviving principal characters, as a married Rick and Evelyn confront Imhotep and the [[Mathayus (Scorpion King)|Scorpion King]].<ref name="rolling stone- mummy return"/> The film also introduced the heroes' son, [[Characters related to The Mummy#Alexander 'Alex' O'Connell|Alex]].<ref name="rolling stone- mummy return">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949327/review/5949328/the_mummy_returns|title=The Mummy Returns|author=Travers, Peter|date=2001-05-09|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2008-04-01|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071203140113/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949327/review/5949328/the_mummy_returns |archivedate = December 3, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> The two films inspired both an [[The Mummy: The Animated Series|animated series]] which lasted two seasons, and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] prequel, ''[[The Scorpion King]]'' (2002), telling the story of the Akkadian warrior as he was crowned king.

A second sequel, called ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'', was released on August 1, 2008. The story takes place in China with the ''Terracotta Emperor'' inspiring the villain, while Rachel Weisz was replaced with [[Maria Bello]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Garrett, Diane|author2=Fleming, Michael  |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962923.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Fraser returns for 'Mummy 3'|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2007-04-11|accessdate=2007-04-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Fleming, Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117964831.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Bello replaces Weisz in 'Mummy'|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2007-05-13|accessdate=2007-05-13 }}</ref> A prequel to ''The Scorpion King'', ''[[The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior]]'', was released [[direct-to-DVD]]. Both films were poorly received by critics.

Two video game adaptations of ''The Mummy'' were published by [[Konami]] and [[Vivendi Games|Universal Interactive]] in 2000: an [[Action game|Action]] [[Adventure game|Adventure]] for the [[PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer game|PC]] developed by [[Rebellion Developments]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psx.ign.com/objects/014/014640.html|title=The Mummy (PSX)|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> as well as a [[Game Boy Color]] [[puzzle game]] developed by Konami Nagoya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/action/mummy/index.html|title=The Mummy (GBC)|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> The film also inspired a [[roller coaster]], ''Revenge of the Mummy'' in three [[Universal Studios Theme Parks]]: [[Revenge of the Mummy (Hollywood)|Hollywood, California]]; [[Revenge of the Mummy (Florida)|Orlando, Florida]]; and [[Revenge of the Mummy (Universal Studios Singapore)|Sentosa, Singapore]]. On April 4, 2012, Universal announced their plans to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the franchise.<ref>Kroll, Justin, Snieder, Jeff, [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052291 "U sets 'Mummy' reboot with Spaihts"], Variety.com, Published 2012-04-04, Retrieved 2012-05-04.</ref>
