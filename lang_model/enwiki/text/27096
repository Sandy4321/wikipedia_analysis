{{Audio|narvik.ogg|'''Narvik'''}} is the third largest [[List of towns and cities in Norway|city]] and [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Nordland]] [[Counties of Norway|county]], [[Norway]] by population. The [[administrative centre]] of the municipality is the city of Narvik.  Other villages in the municipality include [[Ankenesstranda]], [[Beisfjord]], [[Bjerkvik]], [[Bj<U+00F8>rnfjell, Nordland|Bj<U+00F8>rnfjell]], [[Elveg<U+00E5>rd]], [[H<U+00E5>kvik]], [[Hergot]], [[Straumsnes, Narvik|Straumsnes]], and [[Vidrek]].  The [[Elveg<U+00E5>rdsmoen]] army camp is located near [[Bjerkvik]].

Narvik is located on the shores of the [[Ofotfjorden]]. The municipality is part of the [[Districts of Norway|traditional district]] of [[Ofoten]] of [[Northern Norway]], inside the [[Arctic Circle]].  The municipaltiy of Narvik borders the municipality of [[Ballangen]] to the southwest, [[Evenes]] to the northwest, [[Bardu]] and [[Gratangen]] (in [[Troms]] county) to the north, and [[Norrbotten County]] ([[Lapland, Sweden|Lapland]]) in [[Sweden]] to the south and east.

==General information==
[[File:Narvik city centre.jpg|thumb|left|Central Narvik in summer.]]
The municipality of Narvik was established on 1 January 1902 when the village of Narvik received [[List of towns and cities in Norway|city status]] and was separated from the large municipality of [[Ankenes]].  Initially, the city-municipality of Narvik had 3,705 residents.   On 1 January 1974, the municipality of Ankenes was merged with the city-municipality of Narvik, forming a new, larger municipality of Narvik.  After the merger, the new municipality of Narvik had 19,780 residents.  On 1 January 1999, a small area of Narvik (population: 9) was transferred to [[Evenes]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyr<U+00E5>]]|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name="ssb pop">{{cite web|title=1805 Narvik.

==History==
[[File:Narvik1.jpg|thumb|left|Near Narvik city centre; [[Ankenes]] is seen across the bay]]
The history of Narvik as a settlement began in the [[Stone Age]]. Not very much is known about these people, but the [[Viking]]s lived in this area.

The history of modern Narvik begins in the 1870s, when the [[Swedish government]] began to understand the potential of the [[iron ore]] mines in [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. Obtaining iron ore from Kiruna had one significant problem in that there was no suitable Swedish port.  The nearest Swedish port, [[Lule<U+00E5>]], has limitations.  It is covered with ice all winter, it is far from Kiruna, and it allows only medium-sized bulk freight vessels. Realizing these problems, a Swedish company ''(G<U+00E4>llivarre Aktiebolag)'' built a [[Rail transport|railway]] to Narvik, as the port there is ice-free thanks to the warm [[Gulf Stream]], and is naturally large, allowing boats of virtually any size to anchor, up to {{convert|208|m}} long and {{convert|27|m}} deep.<ref name=visit /><ref name=bbc />

Therefore, Narvik was founded as an all-year [[ice free port]] for the [[Kiruna]] and [[G<U+00E4>llivare]] iron [[mining|mines]]. During the construction of the railway, the coming port was called ''Victoriahavn'' (Victoria harbour) until 1898, when the name was changed to Narvik.  The town was officially founded in 1902. The [[Ofot Line|Ofotbanen]] railway line connects Narvik to Kiruna in Sweden, passing through the mountains dividing the two countries. Locals use the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] slang words ''morsan'' (mother) and ''farsan'' (father), a testimony to the close ties with [[Sweden]].

[[LKAB]], the mining corporation, still ships the majority of its ore from Narvik (a total 25 million tons a year) and the [[corporation]] is still important in the area, both as an employer and landowner, although its influence is not as prominent now as it has been in previous years.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A533125|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Narvik, Norway|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref>

===World War II===
{{Main|Battles of Narvik}}
[[File:Lapland1940.png|right|thumb|Iron ore is extracted in Kiruna and [[Malmberget]], and brought by rail to the harbours of [[Lule<U+00E5>]] and Narvik.<br />(Borders as of 1920&ndash;1940.)]]
[[File:Narvik burning WW2.png|thumb|right|thumb|Narvik burning after German bombing, 2. June 1940]]
[[File:Narvik 1928 Rombakfjorden.jpg|thumb|right|Narvik 1928 with the fjord [[Rombaken]] as backdrop]]
The port of Narvik proved to be strategically valuable in the early years of [[World War II]] and the town became a focal point of the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. In 1939, Germany's war industry depended upon iron ore mined in [[Kiruna]] and [[Malmberget]] in Sweden. During the summer season, this ore could be sent by cargo ship to Germany through the [[Baltic Sea]] via the Swedish port of [[Lule<U+00E5>]] on the [[Gulf of Bothnia]]. However, when the Gulf of Bothnia froze during the winter, more shipments of the ore needed to be transported through Narvik and, from there, down the west coast of Norway to Germany. The town of Narvik is linked by rail to Sweden, but not to any other towns in Norway. As a result, Narvik serves as a gateway to the ore fields of Sweden that cannot be easily reached from southern Norway via land. [[Winston Churchill]] realized that the control of Narvik meant stopping most German imports of iron ore during the winter of 1940. This would be advantageous to the Allies, and it might help shorten the war. Equally as important, later in the war, German submarines and warships based there threatened the allied supply line to the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=wc>{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston S|authorlink=Winston Churchill|isbn=978-0-395-41055-4|title=The Second World War: The Gathering Storm|volume=1|location=Cambridge|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1948}}</ref>

Churchill proposed laying a [[naval mine]]field in Norwegian territorial waters around Narvik (referred to as "the Leads"),<ref name=wc /> or else occupying the town with Allied troops. The Allies hoped that they might be able to use an occupied Narvik as a base from which to secure the Swedish ore fields and/or to send supplies and reinforcements to [[Finland]], then fighting the Finnish [[Winter War]] with the Soviet Union. Plans to lay a minefield around Narvik or to seize the town met with debate within the British government - since both plans would mean a violation of Norway's neutrality and sovereignty.<ref name=wc />

Finally, on 8 April 1940, the British [[Admiralty]] launched [[Operation Wilfred]], an attempt to lay anti-shipping minefields around Narvik in Norwegian territorial waters. Coincidentally, Germany launched its invasion of Norway ([[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung]]) on the next day. During this invasion, ten German [[destroyer]]s, each carrying 200 mountain infantry soldiers, were sent to Narvik. The outdated Norwegian [[coastal defence ship]]s [[HNoMS Eidsvold|HNoMS ''Eidsvold'']] and [[HNoMS Norge|HNoMS ''Norge'']] attempted to resist the invasion, but both Norwegian warships were sunk after a short and uneven battle. The British [[Royal Navy]] quickly dispatched several ships to Narvik, including the battleship [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']], and during the [[Battles of Narvik]], the British took control of the coast, destroying the German destroyers that had brought the invasion force to Narvik, as well as other German ships in the area. The German battleships [[German warship Scharnhorst (1936)|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German warship Gneisenau (1936)|''Gneisenau'']] at Narvik sank the British aircraft carrier [[HMS Glorious (77)|HMS ''Glorious'']] during the withdrawal from this battle.<ref name="firstandlast">{{cite book | title=The First and the Last|authorlink=Adolf Galland|last=Galland|first=Adolf|year=2001|pages=92|publisher=Cerberus Publishing|isbn=978-0-89966-728-7}}</ref>

On 12 April 1940, the first convoys of Allied soldiers were sent under Major-General [[Pierse Joseph Mackesy]] to Narvik. The Admiralty urged Mackesy to conduct an assault on Narvik from the sea as soon as possible. However, Mackesy believed that the German harbour defences were too strong for such an invasion to take place. The Admiralty argued that a naval bombardment of Norway would enable the troops to land safely, but General Mackesy refused to subject Norwegian citizens to such a bombardment, and instead he chose to land his troops near Narvik and wait until the snow melted to take over the city.<ref name=wc />

Coordinated by the Norwegian [[General]] [[Carl Gustav Fleischer]], Norwegian, French, Polish, and British forces recaptured Narvik on 28 May 1940.  This is also considered the first Allied infantry victory in World War II.  However, by that time, the Allies were losing the [[Battle of France]] and the [[Operation Dynamo|evacuation from Dunkirk]] was underway. Since the [[Nazi German]] invasion of France had made Scandinavia largely irrelevant, and since the valuable troops assigned to Narvik were badly needed elsewhere, the Allies withdrew from Narvik on 8 June 1940 in [[Operation Alphabet]]. Without support from the Allied naval task force, the Norwegians were outnumbered, and they had to lay down their arms in Norway on 10 June 1940. This was not a complete capitulation, since the Norwegians kept on fighting [[guerrilla]] operations inland.

Possession of the [[Ofotfjord]] was also important to the German [[Kriegsmarine]] (navy) since it provided a refuge for warships like the pocket battleship [[German pocket battleship Deutschland|''L<U+00FC>tzow'']] and the battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] outside the range of air attacks from [[Scotland]]. Also, possibly [[U-boats]] were based at Narvik.

==Geography==
[[File:Narvik map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Narvik municipality]]
[[File:Narvik sign post.jpg|thumb|right|Narvik - {{convert|2407|km|0|abbr=on}} from North Pole]]
The municipality of Narvik covers large areas outside of the city itself. Some of the other settlements in the municipality are [[Bjerkvik]] (located at the head of the [[Herjangsfjord]]), [[H<U+00E5>kvik]], [[Beisfjord]], and [[Skjomen]]. The eastern part, towards the border with [[Sweden]], is dominated by mountains, and [[Storsteinfjellet]] reaches {{convert|1894|m|ft}}. There are also valleys and lakes, including the lakes [[Gautelisvatnet]], [[Hartvikvatnet]], [[Indre Sildvikvatnet]], [[Iptoj<U+00E1>vri]], [[Kj<U+00E5>rdavatnet]], [[Lossivatnet]], [[Sealggaj<U+00E1>vri]], and [[Unna Guovdelisj<U+00E1>vri]].

The city itself is situated near the innermost part of the deep [[Ofotfjord]], but even here the mountains, going almost straight up from the blue [[fjord]], reach as high as {{convert|1700|m|ft}} in [[Skjomen]], where the [[glacier]] [[Frostisen]] can be seen. Other fjords in Narvik include the [[Beisfjorden]], [[Herjangsfjord]], and [[Rombaken]].  

[[Forests]] cover the lower parts of the mountains (below 500 meters), but near the summits, the [[snow]] can stay most of the summer. Narvik has well prepared slopes for [[alpine skiing]], some of which end almost in the city centre.

===Climate===
Situated {{convert|220|km|mi}} inside the [[arctic circle]], Narvik is one of the most northerly towns in the world. However, the [[North Atlantic Current]] (extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]) gives Narvik a milder climate than one might expect for a town at this [[latitude]]. In addition, the mountains surrounding the town give shelter from the strong winds typical for coastal areas. Mean annual temperature is {{convert|3.8|C|F|0}}, and the [[growing season]] in the lowland is approximately 150 days, thus allowing inhabitants with an interest for [[gardening]] to grow many imported plants.<ref name=visit />
[[File:Rombakst<U+00F8>tta May.JPG|thumb|left|In early May, there is still large amounts of snow in the mountains, as here in Rombaken.]]

Summer lasts from beginning of June until early September. Record high and low in July is {{convert|31.5|C|F|0}} (July 3, 1972, source:eklima/met.no) and {{convert|4|C|F|0}}. Record high and low in January is {{convert|11|C|F|0}} and {{convert|-20|C|F|0}}. The wettest month is October and the driest month is May; annual precipitation is {{convert|830|mm|in}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://met.no/observasjoner/nordland/normaler_for_kommune_1805.html?kommuner|publisher=Met.no|title=Temperaturnormaler for Narvik i perioden 1961 - 1990|accessdate=2008-11-24|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT004070|publisher=BBC|title=Average Conditions - Narvik|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref>

The light varies considerably in Narvik since the sun is below the [[horizon]] from late November until mid-January; when there is only a bluish light for a few hours around [[noon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/narvik.html|publisher=Gaisma.com|title=Narvik daylight|accessdate=2008-11-24}}</ref> The mountains surrounding the town in reality extend this period from early November until the end of January. The light is often intense in March and April, with long daylight hours and snow cover since the snow melts in lowland areas in April, but stays in the mountains for several months. The "[[midnight sun]]" is above the horizon from May 25 to July 18, and the period with continuous daylight lasts a bit longer, from approximately May 10 to the end of July.  There is also a transitional period with twilight in the night, so you will not be able to see any stars at night from the last days of April until early August.

==Economy==
Narvik is a commercial centre for some of the neighbouring municipalities. [[Narvik University College]] has approximately 1,200 students.  There are some high-tech businesses in Narvik (among them Natech and Scancell).

Narvik was one of the first areas in the world to be affected by the [[Late-2000s financial crisis]]. It lost $18 million in August 2007 after it invested in [[Citigroup]] securities. As the Norwegian government refused to bail them out, Narvik was forced to implement severe budget cuts.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/jun/30/subprimecrisis.creditcrunch | work=The Guardian | first=Gwladys | last=Fouche | title=Sub-prime chill reaches the Arctic | date=30 June 2008}}</ref>

===Recreation and tourism===
[[File:Rallarveien Ofotbanen.jpg|thumb|left|Rallarveien; hiking route near the railway from the mountains down to the [[Rombaken]] fjord]]
Narvik has access to numerous outdoor activities. This is the best known location in northern Norway when it comes to alpine skiing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winter rail destinations: Narvik|curly=y|url=http://www.thelocal.se/15410/20081103|work=[[SJ AB]]|publisher=TheLocal.se|date=3 November 2008|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref>

[[File:Skjomen-fjord-and-Lappviktind.jpg|thumb|right|Skjomen fjord]]
There are lifts, and several of the slopes are floodlit. There is also a [[Gondola lift|cable car]] to Fagernesfjellet, with a stunning view and the possibility to walk even higher up in the mountains. A signed mountain bike route is also available. Narvik Winter Festival ({{lang-no|Vinterfestuka}}) takes place in early March. Mountain [[hiking]] is, understandably, very popular in this area, and the mountain area near the Swedish border has several accommodation possibilities. [[Wreck diving]] attracts divers to Narvik, as there are a lot of wrecks in or near the harbour, and more spread out in the fjord. Fishing in the fjord or in lakes and streams is a popular leisure activity. There are [[salmon]] rivers in [[Skjomen]], Beisfjord and Bjerkvik. The 18-hole Golf Course in [[Elveg<U+00E5>rd]] is situated in a very scenic landscape, and is one of the most northern in the world. Narvik was destroyed by the fighting in 1940 and hastily rebuilt, hence the [[architecture]] is rather functional, but private homes are often painted in bright colours.

There is an Occupation Museum about the years 1940-1945 which holds the [[Victoria Cross]] awarded posthumously to Captain [[Bernard Warburton-Lee]] of the British [[Royal Navy]] in 1940 and a rare German [[Enigma machine|Enigma coding machine]].

==Transportation==
[[File:Rc6-tog i Narvik.JPG|thumb|right|The railway in Narvik]]
[[File:View from Fagernesfjellet.jpg|thumb|right|View from Fagernes mountain overlooking Narvik harbour and Ofotfjord, April 2009.]]
A present and historical key to land transportation to Narvik is the [[Ofoten Line]] railroad from northern Sweden across the mountains to this port town. Goods like iron ore shipped via this railroad make Narvik an important seaport.  The railroad has stops at [[Bj<U+00F8>rnfjell Station]], [[Katterat Station]], [[S<U+00F8>sterbekk Station]], and [[Narvik Station]].

The port of Narvik is ice-free and well protected from the weather. The port consists of three waterfront sections: [[LKAB]] bulk port, central port area with piers and deep-water harbor at Fagernes with intermodal facilities. Approximately {{convert|16000000|t}} of cargo are annually shipped from the ports of Narvik. Most of this iron ore.

Port Authorities have initiated an expansion of the container area of approximately {{convert|45000|m2|acre}}, which is more than twice Norways largest terminal in Oslo today handles.  In 2005, the port of Narvik got status as [[Motorways of the Sea]] in the EU-system. In Norway, Oslo is the only city which have this status in addition to Narvik.

[[Hurtigruten]] or "Hurtigruta" (literally "Express Route", but sometimes referred to as "Norwegian Coastal Express" in English) is headquartered in Narvik. However, Hurtigruten do not have any regular sailings to Narvik.

Because of the extreme terrain there, there are no railroads northwards from Narvik or south to [[Bod<U+00F8>]], [[Norway]], which is at the northern end of the rest of Norway's railroad network. However, it is possible to reach Narvik by way of an approximately twenty-hour {{convert|1540|km|mi|adj=on}} train ride through the Swedish rail system from [[Stockholm]].

The activity related to the railway and large port facilities are still important in Narvik, and goods to and from [[North Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Finland]] are often distributed via Narvik. In the proposed project called the "[[Northern East West Freight Corridor]]" portion of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge]], there are plans for using Narvik as a port for goods from [[East Asia]] bound for eastern [[North America]]. The reason is that the railroad and ocean distances for these are shorter than though central Europe to Western European ports.

[[European route E6]] crosses through the municipality using three bridges: [[Skjomen Bridge]], [[Beisfjord Bridge]], and [[Rombak Bridge]]. There is also the proposed [[H<U+00E5>logaland Bridge]] that will cross the [[Rombaken]] fjord.  Narvik is served by two [[airport]]s: the small [[Narvik Airport, Framnes]] just outside the city centre has a short runway and is served by De Havilland DHC-8 100 aircraft with regular flights to [[Bod<U+00F8>]]. The larger and more capable [[Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes]] is {{convert|80|km|mi|0}} by road from Narvik and have regular flights to [[Oslo]], [[Trondheim]], [[Bod<U+00F8>]] and [[Troms<U+00F8>]].

There are highway connections from Narvik across the mountains eastwards to [[Abisko]] and [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]] (via [[European route E10]]).
