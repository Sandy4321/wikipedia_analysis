'''Sir Arthur Wheeler, 1st Baronet''' ([[18 September]] [[1860]]&ndash;[[20 May]] [[1943]]) was an [[England|English]] [[stockbroker]] and [[financier]].

Wheeler was born in [[Nottingham]]. He was educated at [[Nottingham High School]] and joined Simon, Meyer & Co, a [[lace]] exporter, as a clerk. He rose to be chief clerk and in 1899 launched his own stockbroking firm in [[Leicester]], concentrating on serving [[Midlands]] firms which were too small to launch themselves in the [[City of London]].

During the [[First World War]], Wheeler dedicated his energies to selling [[war bond]]s, and for this he was created a [[Baronet]] in the 1920 New Year Honours. He was ruined by the [[Great Depression|Depression]], was declared [[bankrupt]], and in 1931 was jailed for twelve months for [[fraud]]. After his release he retired from business.
