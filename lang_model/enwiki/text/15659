The '''analysis of errors in the information reported by the Global Positioning System''', a space-based satellite system for navigation, is important to estimating the accuracy of position estimates and correcting for the errors. The Global Positioning System (GPS) was created by the United States Department of Defense (DOD) in the 1970s. It has come to be widely used for navigation both by the U.S. military and the general public.

The positioning data provided directly by the satellites is extremely precise but there are many factors that can create make the errors in the data non-trivial. In situations where high accuracy is necessary, understanding and compensating for these sources of error is important. Sources of error include atmospheric distortion (predominantly in the [[ionosphere]]), satellite clock inaccuracies, and the travel delays of the satellite signals.

User equivalent range errors (UERE) are shown in the table. There is also a [[numerical error]] with an estimated value, <math>\ \sigma_{num} </math>, of about 1 meter. The standard deviations, <math>\ \sigma_R</math>, for the coarse/acquisition and precise codes are also shown in the table. These standard deviations are computed by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual components (i.e., RSS for root sum squares). To get the standard deviation of receiver position estimate, these range errors must be multiplied by the appropriate dilution of precision terms and then RSS'ed with the numerical error. Electronics errors are one of several accuracy-degrading effects outlined in the table above. When taken together, autonomous civilian GPS horizontal position fixes are typically accurate to about 15 meters (50&nbsp;ft). These effects also reduce the more precise P(Y) code's accuracy. However, the advancement of technology means that today, civilian GPS fixes under a clear view of the sky are on average accurate to about 5 meters (16&nbsp;ft) horizontally.

The term user equivalent range error (UERE) refers to the error of a component in the distance from receiver to a satellite.  These UERE errors are given as <U+00B1> errors thereby implying that they are unbiased or zero mean errors.  These UERE errors are therefore used in computing standard deviations.  The standard deviation of the error in receiver position,
<math>\ \sigma_{rc}</math>, is computed by multiplying PDOP (Position Dilution Of Precision) by
<math>\ \sigma_R</math>, the standard deviation of the user equivalent range errors.
<math>\ \sigma_R</math> is computed by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual component standard deviations.

PDOP is computed as a function of receiver and satellite positions.  A detailed description of how to calculate PDOP is given in the section, geometric dilution of precision computation (GDOP).

<math>\ \sigma_R</math> for the C/A code is given by:
:<math>\sigma_R= \sqrt{3^2+5^2+2.5^2+2^2+1^2+0.5^2} \, \mathrm{m} \,=\,6.7 \, \mathrm{m}</math>

The standard deviation of the error in estimated receiver position <math>\ \sigma_{rc}</math>, again for the C/A code is given by:
:<math>\ \sigma_{rc} = \sqrt{PDOP^2 \times \sigma_R^2 + \sigma_{num}^2} = \sqrt{PDOP^2 \times 6.7^2 + 1^2} \, \mathrm{m}</math>

The error diagram on the left shows the inter relationship of indicated receiver position, true receiver position, and the intersection of the four sphere surfaces.

== Signal arrival time measurement ==
The position calculated by a GPS receiver requires the current time, the position of the satellite and the measured delay of the received signal. The position accuracy is primarily dependent on the satellite position and signal delay.

To measure the delay, the receiver compares the bit sequence received from the satellite with an internally generated version. By comparing the rising and trailing edges of the bit transitions, modern electronics can measure signal offset to within about one percent of a bit pulse width, <math>\frac{0.01}{(1.023 \times 10^6 /\mathrm{s})}</math>, or approximately 10 nanoseconds for the C/A code. Since GPS signals propagate at the [[speed of light]], this represents an error of about 3 meters.

This component of position accuracy can be improved by a factor of 10 using the higher-chiprate P(Y) signal. Assuming the same one percent of bit pulse width accuracy, the high-frequency P(Y) signal results in an accuracy of <math>\frac {(0.01 \times 300,000,000\ \mathrm{m/s})} {(10.23 \times 10^6 / \mathrm{s})}</math> or about 30 centimeters.

== Atmospheric effects ==
Inconsistencies of atmospheric conditions affect the speed of the GPS signals as they pass through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], especially the [[ionosphere]]. Correcting these errors is a significant challenge to improving GPS position accuracy. These effects are smallest when the satellite is directly overhead and become greater for satellites nearer the [[horizon]] since the path through the atmosphere is longer (see [[airmass]]). Once the receiver's approximate location is known, a mathematical model can be used to estimate and compensate for these errors.

Ionospheric delay of a microwave signal depends on its frequency. This phenomenon is known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and can be calculated from measurements of delays for two or more frequency bands, allowing delays at other frequencies to be estimated.<ref>The same principle, and the math behind it, can be found in descriptions of [[dispersion (optics)#Dispersion in pulsar timing|pulsar timing by astronomers]].</ref> Some military and expensive survey-grade civilian receivers calculate atmospheric dispersion from the different delays in the L1 and L2 frequencies, and apply a more precise correction. This can be done in civilian receivers without decrypting the P(Y) signal carried on L2, by tracking the [[carrier wave]] instead of the [[modulation|modulated]] code. To facilitate this on lower cost receivers, a new civilian code signal on L2, called L2C, was added to the Block IIR-M satellites, which was first launched in 2005. It allows a direct comparison of the L1 and L2 signals using the coded signal instead of the carrier wave.

The effects of the ionosphere generally change slowly, and can be averaged over time. Those for any particular geographical area can be easily calculated by comparing the GPS-measured position to a known surveyed location. This correction is also valid for other receivers in the same general location. Several systems send this information over radio or other links to allow L1-only receivers to make ionospheric corrections. The ionospheric data are transmitted via satellite in [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]]s (SBAS) such as [[WAAS]] (available in North America and Hawaii), [[EGNOS]] (Europe and Asia) or [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System|MSAS]] (Japan), which transmits it on the GPS frequency using a special pseudo-random noise sequence (PRN), so only one receiver and antenna are required.

[[Humidity]] also causes a variable delay, resulting in errors similar to ionospheric delay, but occurring in the [[troposphere]]. This effect both is more localized and changes more quickly than ionospheric effects, and is not frequency dependent. These traits make precise measurement and compensation of humidity errors more difficult than ionospheric effects.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Changes in receiver altitude also change the delay, due to the signal passing through less of the atmosphere at higher elevations. Since the GPS receiver computes its approximate altitude this error is relatively simple to correct, either by applying a function regression or correlating margin of atmospheric error to ambient pressure using a barometric altimeter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== Multipath effects ==
GPS signals can also be affected by [[multipath interference|multipath]] issues, where the radio signals reflect off surrounding terrain; buildings, canyon walls, hard ground, etc. These delayed signals can cause inaccuracy. A variety of techniques, most notably [[narrow correlator spacing]], have been developed to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a [[choke ring antenna]]) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.

Multipath effects are much less severe in moving vehicles. When the GPS antenna is moving, the false solutions using reflected signals quickly fail to converge and only the direct signals result in stable solutions.

== Ephemeris and clock errors ==
While the ephemeris data is transmitted every 30 seconds, the information itself may be up to two hours old. If a fast [[time to first fix]] (TTFF) is needed, it is possible to upload a valid ephemeris to a receiver, and in addition to setting the time, a position fix can be obtained in under ten seconds. It is feasible to put such ephemeris data on the web so it can be loaded into mobile GPS devices.<ref>{{cite web|author=SNT080408 |url=http://www.tdc.co.uk/index.php?key=ephemeris |title=Ephemeris Server Example |publisher=Tdc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> See also [[Assisted GPS]].

The satellite's atomic clocks experience noise and [[clock drift]] errors. The navigation message contains corrections for these errors and estimates of the accuracy of the atomic clock. However, they are based on observations and may not indicate the clock's current state.

These problems tend to be very small, but may add up to a few meters (tens of feet) of inaccuracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~battag/GAMITwrkshp/lecturenotes/unit1/unit1.html#3 |title=Unit 1 - Introduction to GPS}}</ref>

For very precise positioning (e.g., in [[geodesy]]), these effects can be eliminated by [[differential GPS]]: the simultaneous use of two or more receivers at several [[Benchmark (surveying)|survey points]]. In the 1990s when receivers were quite expensive, some methods of ''quasi-differential'' GPS were developed, using only ''one'' receiver but reoccupation of measuring points. At the TU Vienna the method was named ''qGPS'' and adequate software of post processing was developed.

== Geometric dilution of precision computation (GDOP) ==
{{anchor|gdop}}

The concept of geometric dilution of precision was introduced in the section, ''error sources and analysis''. Computations were provided to show how PDOP was used and how it affected the receiver position error standard deviation.

When visible GPS satellites are close together in the sky (i.e., small angular separation), the DOP values are high; when far apart, the DOP values are low. Conceptually, satellites that are close together cannot provide as much information as satellites that are widely separated. Low DOP values represent a better GPS positional accuracy due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate GPS receiver position. HDOP, VDOP, PDOP and TDOP are respectively Horizontal, Vertical, Position (3-D) and Time Dilution of Precision.

Figure 3.1 Dilution of Precision of Navstar GPS data from the U.S. Coast Guard provide a graphical indication of how geometry affect accuracy.

We now take on the task of how to compute the dilution of precision terms. As a first step in computing DOP, consider the unit vector from the receiver to satellite i with components <math>\frac{(x_i- x)}{R_i}</math>, <math>\frac {(y_i-y)}{R_i}</math>, and <math>\frac {(z_i-z)}{R_i}</math> where the distance from receiver to the satellite, <math>\ R_i </math>, is given by:
:<math>R_i\,=\,\sqrt{(x_i- x)^2 + (y_i-y)^2 + (z_i-z)^2}</math>
where <math>\ x, y, and\ z</math> denote the position of the receiver and <math>\ x_i, y_i, and\ z_i</math> denote the position of satellite i. These x, y, and z components may be components in a North, East, Down coordinate system a South, East, Up coordinate system or other convenient system. Formulate the matrix ''A'' as:
:<math>A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac {(x_1- x)} {R_1} & \frac {(y_1-y)} {R_1} & \frac {(z_1-z)} {R_1} & c \\
\frac {(x_2- x)} {R_2} & \frac {(y_2-y)} {R_2} & \frac {(z_2-z)} {R_2} & c \\
\frac {(x_3- x)} {R_3} & \frac {(y_3-y)} {R_3} & \frac {(z_3-z)} {R_3} & c \\
\frac {(x_4- x)} {R_4} & \frac {(y_4-y)} {R_4} & \frac {(z_4-z)} {R_4} & c
\end{bmatrix}</math>

The first three elements of each row of A are the components of a unit vector from the receiver to the indicated satellite. The elements in the fourth column are c where c denotes the [[speed of light]]. Formulate the matrix, Q, as
:<math> Q = \left (A^T A \right )^{-1}
</math>

This computation is in accordance with Chapter 11 of The global positioning system by Parkinson and Spilker where the weighting matrix, P, has been set to the identity matrix. The elements of the Q matrix are designated as:<ref>Parkinson (1996)</ref>
:<math>Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
d_x^2    & d_{xy}^2 & d_{xz}^2 & d_{xt}^2 \\
d_{xy}^2 & d_{y}^2  & d_{yz}^2 & d_{yt}^2 \\
d_{xz}^2 & d_{yz}^2 & d_{z}^2 & d_{zt}^2 \\
d_{xt}^2 & d_{yt}^2 & d_{zt}^2 & d_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix}
</math>

The Greek letter <math>\ \sigma</math> is used quite often where we have used d. However the elements of the Q matrix do not represent variances and covariances as they are defined in probability and statistics. Instead they are strictly geometric terms. Therefore d as in dilution of precision is used. PDOP, TDOP and GDOP are given by
:<math>PDOP = \sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2}</math>,
:<math>\ TDOP = \sqrt{d_{t}^2} = |d_{t}|\ </math>, and
:<math> GDOP = \sqrt{PDOP^2 + TDOP^2}</math>
in agreement with [http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap1/149.htm "Section 1.4.9 of PRINCIPLES OF SATELLITE POSITIONING"].

The horizontal dilution of precision, <math> HDOP = \sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2}</math>, and the vertical dilution of precision, <math>\ VDOP = \sqrt{d_{z}^2}</math>, are both dependent on the coordinate system used. To correspond to the local horizon plane and the local vertical, x, y, and z should denote positions in either a North, East, Down coordinate system or a South, East, Up coordinate system.

=== Derivation of DOP equations ===
The equations for computing the geometric dilution of precision terms have been described in the previous section. This section describes the derivation of these equations. The method used here is similar to that used in [http://books.google.com/books?id=lvI1a5J_4ewC&pg=PA474&lpg=PA474&dq=PDOP+derivation&source=web&ots=k5ojJtGZFu&sig=NwwUJb5wAKYuXooiYmvwGKRWkJQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA470,M1 "Global Positioning System (preview) by Parkinson and Spiker"]

Consider the position error vector, <math>\mathbf{e}</math>, defined as the vector from the intersection of the four sphere surfaces corresponding to the pseudoranges to the true position of the receiver. <math>\mathbf{e} = e_x\hat{x} + e_y\hat{y} + e_z\hat{z} </math> where bold denotes a vector and <math>\hat{x}</math>, <math>\hat{y}</math>, and <math>\hat{z}</math> denote unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes respectively. Let <math>\ e_t</math> denote the time error, the true time minus the receiver indicated time. Assume that the mean value of the three components of <math>\mathbf {e}</math> and <math>\ e_t</math> are zero.

:<math>A\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac {(x_1- x)} {R_1} & \frac {(y_1-y)} {R_1} & \frac {(z_1-z)} {R_1} & c \\
\frac {(x_2- x)} {R_2} & \frac {(y_2-y)} {R_2} & \frac {(z_2-z)} {R_2} & c \\
\frac {(x_3- x)} {R_3} & \frac {(y_3-y)} {R_3} & \frac {(z_3-z)} {R_3} & c \\
\frac {(x_4- x)} {R_4} & \frac {(y_4-y)} {R_4} & \frac {(z_4-z)} {R_4} & c
\end{bmatrix}\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4 
\end{bmatrix}
\ (1)</math>
where <math>\ e_1,\ e_2,\ e_3,\ and\ e_4 </math> are the errors in pseudoranges 1 through 4 respectively. This equation comes from linearizing the equation relating pseudoranges to receiver position, satellite positions, and receiver clock errors as shown in.<ref>{{cite web|author=<U+010C>esky |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#multi_nr |title=Global Positioning System - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>
Multiplying both sides by <math>\ A^{-1}\ </math> there results
:<math>\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t 
\end{bmatrix} = 
A^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4 
\end{bmatrix} \ (2)</math> .

Transposing both sides:
:<math>\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x & e_y & e_z & e_t 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 & e_2 & e_3 & e_4 
\end{bmatrix}\left (A^{-1} \right )^T \ (3)</math> .
Post multiplying the matrices on both sides of equation (2) by the corresponding matrices in equation (3), there results
:<math>\ 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t 
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x & e_y & e_z & e_t 
\end{bmatrix} = 
A^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 & e_2 & e_3 & e_4 
\end{bmatrix}\left (A^{-1} \right )^T \ (4)
</math> .

Taking the expected value of both sides and taking the non-random matrices outside the expectation operator, E, there results:
:<math>\ E
\left (\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t 
\end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x & e_y & e_z & e_t 
\end{bmatrix} \right ) = 
A^{-1} \ E
\left (\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4 
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 & e_2 & e_3 & e_4 
\end{bmatrix} \right )
\left (A^{-1} \right )^T \ (5)
</math>
Assuming the pseudorange errors are uncorrelated and have the same variance, the covariance matrix on the right side can be expressed as a scalar times the identity matrix. Thus

:<math>
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_x^2    & \sigma_{xy}^2 & \sigma_{xz}^2 & \sigma_{xt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xy}^2 & \sigma_{y}^2  & \sigma_{yz}^2 & \sigma_{yt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xz}^2 & \sigma_{yz}^2 & \sigma_{z}^2 & \sigma_{zt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xt}^2 & \sigma_{yt}^2 & \sigma_{zt}^2 & \sigma_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix} = \sigma_R^2 \ A^{-1} \left (A^{-1} \right )^T = 
\sigma_R^2 \ \left (A^T A \right )^{-1} \ (6)</math>
since <math>\ A^{-1} \left (A^{-1} \right )^T \left (A^T A \right ) = I </math>

Note: <math>\left (A^{-1} \right )^T = \left (A^{T} \right )^{-1},\ </math> since <math>\ I = \left(A A^{-1}\right)^T = \left(A^{-1}\right)^T A^T</math>

Substituting for <math>\left (A^T A \right )^{-1} = Q </math> there follows
:<math>
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_x^2    & \sigma_{xy}^2 & \sigma_{xz}^2 & \sigma_{xt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xy}^2 & \sigma_{y}^2  & \sigma_{yz}^2 & \sigma_{yt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xz}^2 & \sigma_{yz}^2 & \sigma_{z}^2 & \sigma_{zt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xt}^2 & \sigma_{yt}^2 & \sigma_{zt}^2 & \sigma_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix}  = \sigma_R^2 \ 
\begin{bmatrix}
d_x^2    & d_{xy}^2 & d_{xz}^2 & d_{xt}^2 \\
d_{xy}^2 & d_{y}^2  & d_{yz}^2 & d_{yt}^2 \\
d_{xz}^2 & d_{yz}^2 & d_{z}^2 & d_{zt}^2 \\
d_{xt}^2 & d_{yt}^2 & d_{zt}^2 & d_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix} \ (7)
</math>

From equation (7), it follows that the variances of indicated receiver position and time are
:<math>\sigma_{rc}^2 = \sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + \sigma_z^2 = \sigma_R^2\left(d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2\right) = PDOP^2 \sigma_R^2</math> and
:<math>\sigma_t^2 = \sigma_R^2 d_t^2 = TDOP^2 \sigma_R^2</math>

The remaining position and time error variance terms follow in a straightforward manner.

== Selective availability ==
GPS includes a (currently disabled) feature called ''Selective Availability'' (''SA'') that adds intentional, time varying errors of up to 100 meters (328&nbsp;ft) to the publicly available navigation signals. This was intended to deny an enemy the use of civilian GPS receivers for precision weapon guidance.

SA errors are actually pseudorandom, generated by a cryptographic algorithm from a classified ''seed'' [[key (cryptography)|key]] available only to authorized users (the U.S. military, its allies and a few other users, mostly government) with a special military GPS receiver. Mere possession of the receiver is insufficient; it still needs the tightly controlled daily key.

Before it was turned off on May 1, 2000, typical SA errors were about 50&nbsp;m (164&nbsp;ft) horizontally and about 100&nbsp;m (328&nbsp;ft) vertically.<ref>Grewal (2001), p. 103.</ref> Because SA affects every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. This is called [[Differential GPS]] or ''DGPS''. DGPS also corrects for several other important sources of GPS errors, particularly ionospheric delay, so it continues to be widely used even though SA has been turned off. The ineffectiveness of SA in the face of widely available DGPS was a common argument for turning off SA, and this was finally done by order of President Clinton in 2000.

Another restriction on GPS, antispoofing, remains on. This encrypts the ''P-code'' so that it cannot be mimicked by an enemy transmitter sending false information. Few civilian receivers have ever used the P-code, and the accuracy attainable with the public C/A code is so much better than originally expected (especially with DGPS) that the antispoof policy has relatively little effect on most civilian users. Turning off antispoof would primarily benefit surveyors and some scientists who need extremely precise positions for experiments such as tracking the motion of a tectonic plate.

DGPS services are widely available from both commercial and government sources. The latter include [[WAAS]] and the [[US Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard's]] network of [[Low frequency|LF]] marine navigation beacons. The accuracy of the corrections depends on the distance between the user and the DGPS receiver. As the distance increases, the errors at the two sites will not correlate as well, resulting in less precise differential corrections.

During the 1990-91 [[Gulf War]], the shortage of military GPS units caused many troops and their families to buy readily available civilian units. This significantly impeded the U.S. military's own battlefield use of GPS, so the military made the decision to turn off SA for the duration of the war.

In the 1990s, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] started pressuring the military to turn off SA permanently. This would save the FAA millions of dollars every year in maintenance of their own [[radio navigation]] systems. The amount of error added was "set to zero"<ref name="OSTP">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/statement.html|publisher=[[Office of Science and Technology Policy]]|title=Statement by the President regarding the United States' Decision to Stop Degrading Global Positioning System Accuracy|date=May 1, 2000|accessdate=2009-02-02}}</ref> at midnight on May 1, 2000 following an announcement by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], allowing users access to the error-free L1 signal. Per the directive, the induced error of SA was changed to add no error to the public signals (C/A code). Clinton's executive order required SA to be set to zero by 2006; it happened in 2000 once the U.S. military developed a new system that provides the ability to deny GPS (and other navigation services) to hostile forces in a specific area of crisis without affecting the rest of the world or its own military systems.<ref name="OSTP" />

Selective Availability is still a system capability of GPS, and could, in theory, be reintroduced at any time. In practice, in view of the hazards and costs this would induce for U.S. and foreign shipping, it is unlikely to be reintroduced, and various government agencies, including the [[FAA]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/faq/gps/index.cfm#ad3|title=GNSS - Frequently Asked Questions - GPS: Will SA ever be turned back on?|publisher=FAA|accessdate=2007-12-17|date=June 13, 2007}}</ref> have stated that it is not intended to be reintroduced.

One interesting side effect of the Selective Availability hardware is the capability to add corrections to the outgoing signal of the GPS [[caesium|cesium]] and [[rubidium]] [[atomic clocks]] to an accuracy of approximately 2&nbsp;<U+00D7>&nbsp;10<sup><U+2212>13</sup><!-- What units?  Hz? kHz? MHz? Answer: This is a dimensionless ratio. For example, 1 s/ 5 trillion s gives one in five trillion.--> This represented a significant improvement over the raw accuracy of the clocks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

On 19 September 2007, the [[United States Department of Defense]] announced that future [[GPS modernization|GPS III]] satellites will not be capable of implementing SA,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11335 | title = DoD Permanently Discontinues Procurement Of Global Positioning System Selective Availability | publisher = DefenseLink | date = September 18, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-20}}</ref> eventually making the policy permanent.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pnt.gov/public/sa/ | title = Selective Availability | publisher = National space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee | accessdate = 2008-02-20}}</ref>

== Relativity ==
[[Image:Orbit times.png|thumb|right|Satellite clocks are slowed by their orbital speed but sped up by their distance out of the Earth's gravitational well.]]
A number of sources of error exist due to [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] effects<ref name=errors>Webb (2004), p. 32.</ref> that would render the system useless if uncorrected. Three relativistic effects are the time dilation, gravitational frequency shift, and eccentricity effects. For example, the relativistic time ''slowing'' due to the speed of the satellite of about 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup>, the gravitational time dilation that makes a satellite run about 5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> ''faster'' than an Earth based clock, and the [[Sagnac effect]] due to rotation relative to receivers on Earth. These topics are examined below, one at a time.

=== Special and general relativity ===
According to the [[theory of relativity]], due to their constant movement and height relative to the Earth-centered, non-rotating approximately inertial [[special relativity#Reference frames, coordinates and the Lorentz transformation|reference frame]], the clocks on the satellites are affected by their speed. [[Special relativity]] predicts that the frequency of the atomic clocks moving at GPS orbital speeds will tick more slowly than stationary ground clocks by a factor of <math>\frac{v^{2}}{2c^{2}}\approx 10 ^{-10}</math>, or result in a delay of about 7 <U+03BC>s/day, where the orbital velocity is v = 4&nbsp;km/s, and c = the speed of light. The [[time dilation]] effect has been measured and verified using the GPS.

The effect of gravitational frequency shift on the GPS due to [[general relativity]] is that a clock closer to a massive object will be slower than a clock farther away. Applied to the GPS, the receivers are much closer to Earth than the satellites, causing the GPS clocks to be faster by a factor of 5<U+00D7>10^(-10), or about 45.9 <U+03BC>s/day. This gravitational frequency shift is noticeable.

When combining the time dilation and gravitational frequency shift, the discrepancy is about 38 microseconds per day, a difference of 4.465 parts in 10<sup>10</sup>.<ref name=Rizos>Rizos, Chris. [[University of New South Wales]]. [http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap3/312.htm GPS Satellite Signals]. 1999.</ref> Without correction, errors in position determination of roughly 10&nbsp;km/day would accumulate. In addition the elliptical, rather than perfectly circular, satellite orbits cause the time dilation and gravitational frequency shift effects to vary with time. This eccentricity effect causes the clock rate difference between a GPS satellite and a receiver to increase or decrease depending on the velocity orbital altitude{{Clarify|date=June 2010}} of the satellite.

To compensate for the discrepancy, the frequency standard on board each satellite is given a rate offset prior to launch, making it run slightly slower than the desired frequency on Earth; specifically, at 10.22999999543&nbsp;MHz instead of 10.23&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=Nelson>[http://www.aticourses.com/global_positioning_system.htm The Global Positioning System by Robert A. Nelson Via Satellite], November 1999</ref> Since the atomic clocks on board the GPS satellites are precisely tuned, it makes the system a practical engineering application of the scientific theory of relativity in a real-world environment.<ref>Pogge, Richard W.; [http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html <U+201C>Real-World Relativity: The GPS Navigation System<U+201D>].

=== Sagnac distortion ===
GPS observation processing must also compensate for the [[Sagnac effect]]. The GPS time scale is defined in an [[inertial]] system but observations are processed in an [[ECEF|Earth-centered, Earth-fixed]] (co-rotating) system, a system in which [[simultaneity]] is not uniquely defined. A [[Lorentz transformation]] is thus applied to convert from the inertial system to the ECEF system. The resulting signal run time correction has opposite algebraic signs for satellites in the Eastern and Western celestial hemispheres. Ignoring this effect will produce an east-west error on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds, or tens of meters in position.<ref>Ashby, Neil [http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/GPS/Neil_Ashby_Relativity_GPS.pdf Relativity and GPS].

== Natural sources of interference ==
Since GPS signals at terrestrial receivers tend to be relatively weak, natural radio signals or scattering of the GPS signals can [[Desensitization (telecommunications)|desensitize]] the receiver, making acquiring and tracking the satellite signals difficult or impossible.

[[Space weather]] degrades GPS operation in two ways, direct interference by solar radio burst noise in the same frequency band<ref>Cerruti, A., P. M. Kintner, D. E. Gary, A. J. Mannucci, R. F. Meyer, P. H. Doherty, and A. J. Coster (2008), Effect of intense December 2006 solar radio bursts on GPS receivers, Space Weather, doi:10.1029/2007SW000375, October 19, 2008</ref> or by scattering of the GPS radio signal in ionospheric irregularities referred to as scintillation.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Aarons, Jules and Basu, Santimay | title=Ionospheric amplitude and phase fluctuations at the GPS frequencies | work=Proceedings of ION GPS | volume=2 | year=1994 | pages=1569-1578}}</ref> Both forms of degradation follow the 11 year [[solar cycle]] and are a maximum at sunspot maximum although they can occur at anytime. Solar radio bursts are associated with [[solar flares]] and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) <ref>S. Mancuso and J. C. Raymond, "Coronal transients and metric type II radio bursts. I. Effects of geometry, 2004, Astronomy and Astrophysics, v.413, p.363-371'</ref>  and their impact can affect reception over the half of the Earth facing the sun. Scintillation occurs most frequently at tropical latitudes where it is a night time phenomenon. It occurs less frequently at high latitudes or mid-latitudes where magnetic storms can lead to scintillation.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ledvina, B. M., J. J. Makela, and P. M. Kintner | year=2002 | title=First observations of intense GPS L1 amplitude scintillations at midlatitude | work=Geophys. Res. Lett. | volume=29(14) | page=1659 | doi=10.1029/2002GL014770}}</ref> In addition to producing scintillation, magnetic storms can produce strong ionospheric gradients that degrade the accuracy of SBAS systems.<ref>Tom Diehl, [http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/library/satNav/media/SATNAV_0604.PDF Solar Flares Hit the Earth- WAAS Bends but Does Not Break], SatNav News, volume 23, June 2004</ref>

== Artificial sources of interference ==
In automotive GPS receivers, metallic features in windshields,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoistollway.com/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/TW_CONTENT_REPOSITORY/TW_CR_IPASS/LPT-SPECIALWINDSHIELDLIST.PDF |title=I-PASS Mounting for Vehicles with Special Windshield Features}}</ref> such as defrosters, or car window tinting films<ref>{{cite web |url=http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/WF/3MWindowFilms/Products/ProductCatalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GE3E02LECFTDQG0V7_nid=9928QS9MGHbeT4DCJBL6BVgl |title=3M Automotive Films}}. Note that the 'Color Stable' films are specifically described as ''not'' interfering with satellite signals.</ref> can act as a [[Faraday cage]], degrading reception just inside the car.

Man-made [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]] (electromagnetic interference) can also disrupt or [[radio jamming|jam]] GPS signals. In one well-documented case it was impossible to receive GPS signals in the entire harbor of [[Moss Landing, California|Moss Landing]], [[California]] due to unintentional jamming caused by malfunctioning TV antenna preamplifiers.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gps/system-challenge/the-hunt-rfi-776 | title=The Hunt for RFI | work=GPS World | date=1 January 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compliance-club.com/archive/bananaskins/201-225.asp |title=EMC compliance club "banana skins" column 222 |publisher=Compliance-club.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref> Intentional jamming is also possible. Generally, stronger signals can interfere with GPS receivers when they are within radio range or line of sight. In 2002 a detailed description of how to build a short-range GPS L1 C/A jammer was published in the online magazine [[Phrack]].<ref>[http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=60&id=13#article Low Cost and Portable GPS Jammer]. [[Phrack]] issue 0x3c (60), article 13. Published December 28, 2002.</ref>

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] believes that such jammers were used occasionally during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|2001 war in Afghanistan]], and the U.S. military claims to have destroyed six GPS jammers during the [[Iraq War]], including one that was destroyed with a GPS-guided bomb.<ref>American Forces Press Service. [http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=29230 Centcom charts progress]. March 25, 2003.</ref> A GPS jammer is relatively easy to detect and locate, making it an attractive target for [[anti-radiation missile]]s. The UK Ministry of Defence tested a jamming system in the UK's West Country on 7 and 8 June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-460279/MoDs-tests-send-satnav-haywire-road-atlas.html | title = MoD's tests will send satnav haywire so take a road atlas | date = 2007-06-06 | work = The Daily Mail }}</ref>

Some countries allow the use of GPS repeaters to allow the reception of GPS signals indoors and in obscured locations; however, under EU and UK laws, the use of these is prohibited as the signals can cause interference to other GPS receivers that receive data from both GPS satellites and the repeater.

Due to the potential for both natural and man-made noise, numerous techniques continue to be developed to deal with the interference. The first is to not rely on GPS as a sole source. According to John Ruley, "[[Instrument flight rules|IFR]] pilots should have a fallback plan in case of a GPS malfunction".<ref>Ruley, John. AVweb. [http://www.avweb.com/news/avionics/182754-1.html GPS jamming]. February 12, 2003.</ref> [[RAIM|Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring]] (RAIM) is a feature included in some receivers, designed to provide a warning to the user if jamming or another problem is detected. The U.S. military has also deployed since 2004 their [[SAASM|Selective Availability / Anti-Spoofing Module]] (SAASM) in the [[Defense Advanced GPS Receiver]] (DAGR).<ref>[https://rdit.army.mil/GPS/CustomContent/gps/ue/dagr.html US Army DAGR page]</ref> In demonstration videos the DAGR was shown to detect jamming and maintain its lock on the encrypted GPS signals during interference which caused civilian receivers to lose lock.
