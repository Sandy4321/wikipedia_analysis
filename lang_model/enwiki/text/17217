'''Myron Arms Hofer''' (born Dec. 20 1931) is an American psychiatrist and research scientist, currently Sackler Institute Professor Emeritus in the Department of Psychiatry at [[Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons]]. He is best known for his research on basic developmental processes at work within the mother-infant relationship. Using animal models, he found unexpected neurobiological and behavioral regulatory processes within the observable interactions of the infant rat and its mother. Through an experimental analysis of these sensorimotor, thermal and nutrient-based processes, he has contributed to our understanding of the impact of early maternal separation, the origins of the attachment system, and the shaping of later development by variations in how mothers and infants interact.<ref>Pipp S. and Harmon RJ.

== Early Life ==

Born in New York City, Hofer<U+2019>s family moved to Cambridge Mass. in 1939 when his father, Philip Hofer, became curator of the Department of Printing and Graphic Arts at Harvard's newly-built [[Houghton Library]]. Hofer went to school and college in the Boston area and married in 1954. His wife, Lynne, co-founded  [http://www.tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/Young_Filmmakers_Rediscovered_1964-1974.html  Young Filmakers Foundation] and later became a psychoanalyst. The Hofers have three children and eight grandchildren.

== Career Path ==

Hofer graduated from [[Harvard College]] and [[Harvard Medical School]] (MD1958), did his residency training in Medicine at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and in Psychiatry at [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]], followed by post-doctoral research at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) and the [[American Museum of Natural History]], before joining the department of psychiatry at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in 1966, where he began his animal model research. In 1984, Hofer moved with his research group to the [http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/pi/faculty/ Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons,] and in 2000 was appointed Director of the  [http://www.sacklerinstitute.org/columbia/ Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology]

== Research and Related Activities ==

Following his early clinical research as member of the NIMH group studying threatened loss and bereavement in the parents of children with leukemia,<ref> Bowlby, J. (1980) <U+201C>Attachment and Loss,Vol.3, Loss, Sadness and Depression<U+201D> Basic Books-Harper Collins, Ch. 7, 112-125, Ch.9, 143-156</ref> Hofer turned to animal model research to study the biological basis for the impact of separation and loss in a typical laboratory mammal. He described widespread bio-behavioral effects in infant rats during the hours after separation from their mothers, and defined the mechanisms for these effects as withdrawal (ie. loss) of numerous unexpected regulators of infant physiology and behavior that he found within the sensorimotor, thermal and nutrient-based interactions between mothers and their infants.  The discovery of these <U+201C>hidden regulators<U+201D> added a new dimension to the concept of early attachment. <ref>Sullivan R, Perry R, Sloan R, Kleinhaus K, Burtchen N.

These studies provided clues and ideas that have guided subsequent research on human mother-infant attachment behaviors,<ref> Winberg J. (2005) "Mother and newborn baby: mutual regulation of physiology and behavior-a selective review" "Developmental Psychobiology" 47: 217-229</ref>and clinical research and thinking about human bereavement. <ref>Shear K and Shair H.

Subsequent research led to an animal model for studying the development of anxiety, extending from childhood separation sensitivity to adult anxiety disorder. Hofer and colleagues explored how the [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] isolation calling response of the infant rat<ref> [http://www.avisoft.com/rats.htm (USV)] </ref> is regulated at the sensory, behavioral and neurochemical levels.<ref> Branchi I, Santucci D and Alleva E (2001) <U+201C>Ultrasonic vocalisation emitted by infant rodents: a tool for assessment of neurobehavioural development<U+201D>  <U+201C>Behavioural Brain Research<U+201D> 125: 50 </ref>  He then used selective breeding for high and for low levels of the infant trait, as a model for studying evolution and how it can interact with developmental processes in the creation of differences in adult [[temperament]]. <ref>Simpson HB, Neria Y, Lewis-Fernandez R, and Schneir F  (2010) <U+201C>Anxiety Disorders: Theory, Research, and Clinical Perspectives<U+201D> Cambridge Univ.
