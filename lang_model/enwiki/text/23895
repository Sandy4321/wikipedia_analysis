The domain name '''ae''' is the [[country code top-level domain]] (ccTLD) in the [[Domain Name System]] of the [[Internet]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It is administered by [[.aeDA]] which is part of the UAE Telecommunications Regulatory Authority.

The [[internationalized country code top-level domain]] in the [[Arabic alphabet]] of the UAE is [[<U+0627><U+0645><U+0627><U+0631><U+0627><U+062A>.]], which is represented as <code>.xn--mgbaam7a8h</code> in [[Punycode]].

==Second and third level domain registrations==
The domain <code>ae</code> is administered by UAE Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA).
Registrations are permitted directly at the second level (unrestricted zone) or at the third level (restricted zone) beneath several category labels. During 1995<U+2013>2003 '''co.ae''' was used for commercial entities, but this has been deprecated by UAEnic in 2003 in preference to the commercial use of second-level registrations; existing '''co.ae''' registrations were allowed to be retained if their registrants so desire. During 2008 when ae was re-delegated to the TRA, the .aeDA published new policies in which co.ae was introduced only for local commercial companies provided that the name is connected to the business name.

==Re-delegation of .ae==
The .AE domain was originally delegated to UUNET. Recognising the domain should be administered in the country, the domain was transferred in 1995 to [[Etisalat]], following a brief period of administration by the [[United Arab Emirates University]]. Since that time, [[Etisalat]], through its division the [[UAE]] Network Information Center (UAEnic), has been responsible for the operation of the .ae domain.

During [[GITEX]] 2006, the Telecommunication Regulatory Authority [[Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (UAE)|TRA]] announced that the .ae [[ccTLD]] management and operations will be re-delegated to the TRA from [[Etisalat]]/UAEnic, the current .ae ccTLD manager. A new entity called .ae Domain Administration (.ae DA) has been formed to take care of management and operations of .ae based on latest DNS and [[Domain Registry]] technologies. During January 2008, [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] officially re-delegated the .ae Domain to the [[Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (UAE)|TRA]].

On 3 August 2008, the .aeDA took over the DNS and launched their services with the new registry system which supports registry<U+2013>registrar model. Currently the .aeDA has accredited eight [[Domain name registrar|registrars]] from different parts of the world. For the first time, Internet users in the [[UAE]] will be able to register and manage their domain names under .ae automatically using an online system without going through manual process which used to take up to six weeks for domain registrations. As per .aeDA policies, current domain holders are allowed to transfer between registrars at no cost.

The .ae is the first [[ccTLD]] in the Arab region to use standard Registry-Registrar model and the .aeDA is the first registry in the region to use industry-standard [[Extensible Provisioning Protocol]] to manage its domains.

==Accredited registrars==
As of 20 October 2010, there are 16 accredited registrars:
* UAENic/[[Etisalat]]
* [[Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Company|Du]]

==Transfer between registrars==
Registrants (domain name holders) can transfer their domains from one registrar to another provided that they obtain a domain name password. Domain name passwords can be recovered online through .aeDA's website [http://password-recovery.aeda.net.ae password-recovery.aeda.net.ae]. After obtaining this password, registrants can supply this password to the gaining registrar who will be able to transfer it directly without dealing with the losing registrar. Losing registrars are prohibited from charging a fee when a domain transfer occur; however gaining registrars may do so.

==Domain name pricing==
.ae domain name retail prices ranges from 30 USD to 200 USD depending on the provider and the level of support and services provided with the domain name.

The .ae registration prices have noticeably dropped since the introduction of .aeDA. Prior to 3 August 2008, .ae domains were offered by [[Etisalat]] for around 41 USD per year while ac.ae, org.ae, gov.ae and sch.ae were offered for around 20 USD per year. International providers used to charge around 100<U+2013>200 USD in order to cover the administrative cost involved in the manual registration process.

After .aeDA's go-live in August 2008, .ae registration price declined to as low as 30 USD with international registrars. [[Etisalat]] prices seems to be fixed at 41 USD per year.

As of a survey done in 2013, the registrar AEserver offer the .ae domain names on its budget arm WebOasis.ae at the industry lowest price of $33 (AED 120).

A few other companies have started initially to offer ultra cheap domain services, however they have hiked the price ever since and this caused massive public disappointment. 
A classic example to this will be through the Instra Corp who has raised the cost from $33 to $75 overnight for both new and old customers. Details can be found [http://www.domaining.ae/2012/11/instra-127-price-hike-ae-domains/ here].

==Domain name count==
During Gitex2008, .aeDA domain name counter showed over 90,000 domain names currently held in the registry, making it the largest ccTLD registry in the Arab region.

==IDN and Arabic domain names==
The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of the UAE and .ae Domain Administration (.aeDA) showed great interest to make the UAE become the first country to offer domain names in Arabic script.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} On 2 March 2009, The UAE's Ministerial Council for Services passed a proposal by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority to register the domain address of 'Emarat' in Arabic script (<U+0627><U+0645><U+0627><U+0631><U+0627><U+062A>) for the country's Arabic domains. The domain will contribute to increasing the number of Internet users visiting Arabic sites and further promote and strengthen the UAE's identity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ministerial Council passes UAE domain in Arabic UAE - The Official Web Site - News |author=UAEinteract.com |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/docs/Ministerial_Council_passes_UAE_domain_in_Arabic/34554.htm|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h5lVT2yY|archivedate=2009-05-27|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref>

During ICANN meeting no. 35 (21<U+2013>26 June 2009) in Sydney, .aeDA representatives mentioned that aeDA's EPP-based registry system is fully compatible with IDN protocols and guidelines.

In January 2010 ICANN announced that the UAE IDN ccTLD (DNS name: xn--mgbaam7a8h, <U+0627><U+0645><U+0627><U+0631><U+0627><U+062A>) was one of the first four new IDN ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process.<ref>{{Cite web

==ENUM of UAE (+971)==
.aeDA, the registry operator of .ae is also the official operator for UAE ENUM Space (971). The ENUM space was redelegated from the incumbent operator [[Etisalat]] since 16 April 2009.
