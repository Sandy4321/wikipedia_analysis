'''Hubert George "Bill" Quackenbush''' (March 2, 1922 <U+2013> September 12, 1999) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] who played for the [[Boston Bruins]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]] in the [[National Hockey League]]. During his 14 year career, he was the first defenceman to win the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]]. He won the award after playing the entire [[1948<U+2013>49 NHL season|1948<U+2013>49 season]] without recording a penalty. The penalty-less season was part of a total of 131 consecutive games he played without being assessed a penalty. Quackenbush, considered to be an elite offensive defenceman during his career, was named to the [[NHL All-Star Team]] five times, played in eight [[NHL All-Star game]]s and was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 1976.

Following his retirement from professional ice hockey, he spent 18 years as head coach of various teams at [[Princeton University]]. Quackenbush coached men's [[golf]], and both the men's and women's ice hockey teams, at various times. He won eight [[Ivy League]] Championships with the men's golf team and three with the women's ice hockey team.

Quackenbush became a fan favorite upon his arrival in Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]]) [[Eddie Shore]].<ref name=loh/> In his [[1949<U+2013>50 NHL season|first season]] in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued to stay out of the [[penalty box]], registering only 4 penalty minutes.<ref name=stats/> However, it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team.<ref name=nhl/> The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in [[1950<U+2013>51 NHL season|1950<U+2013>51]], forcing the team to use several first year players.<ref name=loh/> While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother [[Max Quackenbush|Max]].<ref name=loh/> It was the only time the two played professionally together.<ref name=nhl/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8448236|title=Max Quackenbush's player profile| publisher =National Hockey League|accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star.<ref name=nhl/><ref name=stats/> Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.<ref name=stats/>

Quackenbush retired following the [[1955<U+2013>56 NHL season|1955<U+2013>56 season]],<ref name=kings/> having accumulated only 95 penalty minutes over 774 games.

In 1967, he became the head coach for [[Princeton University]]'s men's ice hockey team,<ref name=obit/> a position he would hold for six seasons.<ref name=boston/> His best season was his first in 1967<U+2013>68, when the Tigers posted a 13<U+2013>10<U+2013>0 record. It was the highest win total for Princeton since 1935<U+2013>36.<ref name=record>{{cite news |url=http://www.uscho.com/stats/teamYxY.php/princeton-tigers/mens-college-hockey/team,pri/gender,m.html|title=Princeton Tigers Men's Hockey: Year-By-Year| publisher = USCHO|accessdate=2010-09-15}}</ref> However, his success with the men's ice hockey team would not last; Priceton won no more than five games for their next five seasons.<ref name=record/> His worst campaign was in 1970<U+2013>71,<ref name=record/> when Princeton had two 11 game losing streaks and a 1<U+2013>22<U+2013>0 overall record.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135781/index.htm|title=Practice Didn't Make Perfect For the 1970-71 Princeton hockey team, the reward for all its hard work came to one victory and 22 defeats | publisher = ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''|date=1978-01-16|accessdate=2010-09-11|first=E.M.|last=Swift}}</ref> Because of this, Quackenbush stepped down as the head coach in 1973.<ref name=boston/><ref name=obit/> In 1969 he began coaching the Princeton Men's golf team. He enjoyed much greater success with the golf team leading them to eight [[Ivy League]] championships.<ref name=kings/> In 1978 Princeton started a [[Princeton Tigers women's ice hockey|Women's Ice Hockey team]], and Quackenbush was asked to coach them.<ref name=boston/> He was still coaching the golf team but decided to accept the additional position and led them to three consecutive Ivy League championships between 1982 and 1984.<ref name=kings/> Quackenbush retired from coaching in 1985, after which he moved to [[Orlando, Florida]], where he lived for several years before moving to [[New Jersey]] in 1997.<ref name=kings/><ref name=obit/>

He married Joan Kalloch and the couple had three sons, Bruce, Scott and Todd. At the time of his passing, Quackenbush also had seven grandchildren.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/17/sports/bill-quackenbush-77-hockey-star-who-rarely-heard-a-whistle.html|title=Bill Quackenbush, 77, Hockey Star Who Rarely Heard a Whistle| publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''|date=1999-09-17|accessdate=2010-09-11|first=Frank|last=Litsky|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5sqFWPiiB|archivedate=2010-09-18}}</ref> He died of [[pneumonia]] and complications from [[Alzheimer's disease]] on September 12, 1999, at Chandler Hall Hospice in [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown, Pennsylvania]], at the age of 77.<ref name=obit/>

== Playing style ==
Quackenbush was an offensive defenceman who carried the puck up the ice,<ref name=obit/> making use of his [[List_of_ice_hockey_terminology#S|stick handling]], passing skills and ability to read the play.<ref name=Detroit/> Over the course of his career, he was considered one of the elite rushing defenceman in the NHL.<ref name=kings/> He was a solid [[Bodycheck|checker]],<ref name=obit/> but relied more on positioning and discipline than physical play.<ref name=loh/> This is evident by his low yearly average of penalty minutes and the fact that he was assessed only one [[major penalty]] throughout his NHL career.<ref name=loh/>

Defensively he made use of [[Checking (ice hockey)|poke checks]] to take the puck from his opponents and excelled at getting to lose pucks and clearing them out of the defensive zone.<ref name=Detroit/> He was adept at keeping opposing forwards from creating offense from behind the net.<ref name=loh/>
