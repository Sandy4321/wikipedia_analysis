'''Clotted cream''' (sometimes called '''Devonshire cream''' or '''Clouted cream''') is a thick [[cream]] made by indirectly heating [[pasteurization|unpasteurised]] cow's [[milk]] using steam or a water bath and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly. During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms 'clots' or 'clouts', hence its alternative name 'Clouted cream'.

It is produced by many dairy farms in [[South West England]], and is an essential part of a [[cream tea]]. Its largest producer is Rodda's, which produces a peak of {{convert|25|t|kg}} of clotted cream each day. Although it has uncertain origins, "Cornish clotted cream" became a [[protected designation of origin]] by [[European Union]] directive in 1998, as long as the milk is produced in Cornwall and the minimum fat content is 55%. Its popularity and unique flavour have made it the subject of myths in both Devon and Cornwall.

==Description==
Clotted cream has been described as having a "nutty, cooked milk" flavour,<ref>{{cite book|last=Figioni|first=Paula|title=How Baking Works: Exploring the Fundamentals of Baking Science|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0470392673|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XqKF7PqV02cC&dq=clotted+cream+flavour&source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=363}}</ref> and a "rich sweet flavour" with a texture that is grainy sometimes with oily globules on the crusted surface.<ref name="technology"/><ref name=IND/> It is a thick cream, with a very high fat content (a minimum 55% but has an average of 64%) meaning that in [[United States of America]] it would be classed as [[butter]].<ref name="ottawa"/> Despite its popularity virtually none is produced by or exported to the USA, due to difficulty with its shelf life.<ref name="ottawa"/>

When compared to the fat levels of other creams, for example single cream at 18%,<ref name="ingredients">{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=Anne|title=Understanding Ingredients|year=1998|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0435428276|page=26}}</ref> clotted cream is often regarded as unhealthy today.

==History==
Originally made by farmers to reduce the amount of waste from their milk, clotted cream has become so deep-rooted in the culture that it is now a tourist attraction.<ref name="case study">{{cite book|title=Between the local and the global: confronting complexity in the contemporary agri-food sector|year=2006|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=076231317X|pages=306<U+2013>309|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6285iMejcogC&dq=clotted+cream&source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=Terry Marsden|coauthors=Jonathan Murdoch|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref> While there is no doubt of its strong association with [[South West England]], it is not clear where it first originated. It is similar to [[Kaymak]] (or Kajmak), a [[Near East]]ern delicacy that is still made all over the Middle East, Southeast Europe, Iran, Afghanistan, India and Turkey, and it is possible that it was introduced to Cornwall 2,000 years ago, when [[Phoenicia]]n traders went there looking for [[tin]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford companion to food|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0192806815|page=225|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JTr-ouCbL2AC&pg=PA225&dq=clotted+cream&hl=en&ei=svb0TPCbFoyXhQehj6mDBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=clotted%20cream&f=false|author=Alan Davidson|coauthors=Tom Jaine}}</ref>

Whether or not it was brought to England from abroad, it has long been disputed whether clotted cream originated in Devon or Cornwall,<ref name=H317>Hawker (1881), p. 317.</ref> and which county makes it the best.<ref>See for instance: {{cite book|title=A tour through Cornwall, in the autumn of 1808|year=1809|publisher=Wilkie and Robinson|pages=360<U+2013>361|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=geYvAAAAYAAJ&dq=clouted+cream&source=gbs_navlinks_s}} and {{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/the-tartars-of-cream-1156842.html |title=The tartars of cream |publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2011-01-07|last=Spencer |first=Nikki |date=30 May 1998}}</ref> There is evidence that the monks of [[Tavistock Abbey]] were making clotted cream in the early 1300s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=John|title=In Praise of Devon: A Guide to Its People, Places and Character|year=1998|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=1870098757}}</ref> After their Abbey had been ransacked by [[Vikings]] in 997 AD, the monks rebuilt it with help of [[Ordulf, Earl of Devon]].

===EU Directives===
In 1993, an application was made for '''Cornish clotted cream''' to have a [[protected designation of origin]] (PDO) in the [[European Union]] for cream produced by the traditional recipe in [[Cornwall]]. This was finally accepted in 1998.<ref>{{cite EU directive |serial=98 |year=1998 |date=30 September 1998 |description=supplementing the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2400/96 on the entry of certain names in the Register of protected designation of origin and protected geographical indications |eurlextag=OJ:L:1998:266:0024:0025:EN:PDF }}</ref> Cornish clotted cream must be made from milk produced in Cornwall.

== Preparation ==
Traditionally, clotted cream was created by straining unpasteurized cow's milk, then heating the cream that had risen to the surface in shallow pans using a [[Bain-marie|water bath]], before a slow cooling.<ref name="technology" /> During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms clots. In the [[United Kingdom]], this process is legally equivalent to [[pasteurization]], although there is no requirement for thermographic records.<ref>{{cite book|title=Milk and milk products: technology, chemistry and microbiology|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=0834219557|pages=204<U+2013>205|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WorGTC1YjsIC&dq=clotted+cream+crust&source=gbs_navlinks_s|author=A. H. Varnam|coauthors=Jane P. Sutherland}}</ref> As the temperatures do not reach the same heights as in pasteurization, much care is needed in ensuring high standards of hygiene.

Today, there are two distinct modern methods for making clotted cream. The "Float Cream method" includes [[scalding (cooking)|scalding]] a floating layer of [[double cream]] in milk ([[skimmed milk|skimmed]] or [[whole milk|whole]]) in shallow trays. To scald, the trays are heated using steam or very hot water. After the mixture has been heated for up to an hour it is slowly cooled over 12 hours or more, before the cream is separated and packaged.<ref name="technology">{{cite book|last=Early|first=Ralph|title=The technology of dairy products|year=1998|publisher=Springer|isbn=075140344X|pages=45<U+2013>49|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BuR28Y-S4SMC&dq=clotted+cream&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> The "Scald Cream method" is similar, but the milk layer is removed and a layer of cream which has been mechanically separated to a minimum fat level is used. This cream is then heated in a similar manner, but at a lower temperature and after a set amount of time it is then chilled and packaged.<ref name="technology" />

Its principal high-volume Cornish manufacturer is [[Rodda's]], a family-owned business based in [[Scorrier]], Cornwall. Founded in 1890,<ref name="interview" /> the company was producing over {{convert|1000000|lb|kg}} per year in 1985,<ref name="ottawa">{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Lisa |title='Clotted cream' caviar of dairy|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ub4yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=W-8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1298,1063710&dq=clotted+cream+legend&hl=en|accessdate=3 December 2010|newspaper=Ottawa Citizen|date=23 January 1985}}</ref> and in the run up to Christmas 2009 they were producing up to {{convert|25|t|kg}} of clotted cream per day.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|title=Interview with Nicholas Rodda|url=http://www.businesscornwall.co.uk/features/face-to-face-nicholas-rodda-123|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref> In the early 1980s, Rodda's signed deals with international airlines to serve small tubs of clotted cream with the in-flight desserts,<ref name="ottawa"/> and the company considers [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tennis championships]] one of their peak selling periods. As a by-product, for every {{convert|100|impgal}} of milk used, {{convert|94|impgal}} of skimmed milk is produced, which is then used in food manufacture.<ref name="interview"/>

One Devon manufacturer, [[Definitely Devon]] was purchased by [[Robert Wiseman Dairies]] in March 2006, closing one of the two Devon based dairies and moving all production to [[Okehampton]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Forty-five jobs go in dairy close |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6078182.stm|accessdate=2 December 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 October 2006}}</ref> Also, throughout southwest England its manufacture is a [[cottage industry]], with many farms and dairies producing cream for sale in local outlets. As clotted cream is not regularly available outside South West England, there are a number of ways to create an approximation. One example is to mix [[mascarpone]] with whipped cream, a little sugar and vanilla extract.

Clotted cream is an essential part of a [[cream tea]], a favourite with [[tourism|tourists]] in Devon and Cornwall. It is served on [[scone (bread)|scones]] with strawberry or raspberry jam, along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in [[Devon]], the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top; in Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream.<ref>{{cite news|title=How do you do take your cream tea? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/cornwall/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8694000/8694384.stm|accessdate=2 December 2010|newspaper=BBC News|date=9 June 2010}}</ref> Cream teas spread to [[southern Australia]] as [[Immigration history of Australia#Colonisation and settlement by Britain|early immigrants]] from Devon and Cornwall took their traditional recipes with them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wakefield Companion to South Australian History|year=2001|publisher=[[Wakefield Press]]|isbn=1862545588|page=210|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EDgPo8KWKh4C|author=Wilfrid Prest, Kerrie Round, Carol S.

===Confectionery===
It can be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, especially clotted cream from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower [[carotene]] levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking. It is used throughout the [[South West England]] in the production of ice cream, for example [[Kelly's ice cream]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kellysofcornwall.co.uk/products|accessdate=3 December 2010|title=Kelly's of Cornwall products}}</ref> and [[fudge]] made in Devon and Cornwall.

===Past usages===
Cabbage cream was a delicacy in the mid-17th century, where layers of clotted cream were interspersed with sugar and [[rosewater]], creating a cabbage effect when served.<ref>{{cite book|title=A gift to young housewives|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253212103|pages=368<U+2013>369}}</ref> In 1881 it was said to have all the health-giving properties of [[cod liver oil]], with the benefit of a better taste.<ref>Hawker (1881), p. 322.</ref> It was a common accompaniment to [[junket (dessert)|junket]], a milk based dessert which went out of fashion in the mid-20th century.

===Notable usages===
As with many Cornish and Devon icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant [[Blunderbore]] (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He eventually fell in love with her and made her his fourth wife.<ref>{{cite book|last=Viccars|first=Sue|title=Frommer's Devon and Cornwall With Your Family|year=2011|publisher=Frommer|isbn=0470749474|page=238}}</ref> Another myth, from [[Dartmoor]], tells of a princess who wanted to marry an [[Elf|Elven]] prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable to sour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/clott_cream.htm|title=Dartmoor Clotted Cream|publisher=Legendary Dartmoor|accessdate=2010-12-03|last=Sandles|first=Tim}}</ref> It was mentioned in [[The Shepheardes Calendar]], a poem by [[Edmund Spenser]] in 1579:

<center>"Ne would she scorn the simple shepherd swain,<br>For she would call him often heam,<br>And give him curds and clouted cream."<ref>Quoted in Hawker (1881), p. 317.</ref></center>


During the reception following the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1981, one course was strawberries and Cornish clotted cream.<ref name="ottawa"/> Clotted cream at the time was mainly eaten in the South West England and was uncommon in London, so was brought to Buckingham Palace directly by Rodda's. In 2010 the shareholders attending [[Marks and Spencer]]'s [[annual general meeting]] were treated to a free tub of clotted cream, possibly to deflect away from an unpopular executive pay package&nbsp;<U+2014> which was approved.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marks and Spencer shareholders support boss's pay plan|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10638950|accessdate=3 December 2010|newspaper=BBC news|date=14 July 2010}}</ref>
