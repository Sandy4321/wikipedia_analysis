'''David Lloyd Johnston''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Canada|CC]] [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|CMM]] [[Order of Merit of the Police Forces|COM]]}} (born June 28, 1941)<ref name=CV1>{{citation| last=Johnston| first=David| title=Curriculum Vitae| date=December 2008| page=1| publisher=University of Waterloo| accessdate=July 8, 2010| ref=CITEREF_Johnston_2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| editor-last=Redmond| editor-first=Chris| title=The first day of the rest of your life| journal=Daily Bulletin| publisher=University of Waterloo| location=Waterloo| date=June 28, 2006| url=http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2006/jun/28we.html| accessdate=July 8, 2010}}</ref> is a [[Canada|Canadian]] academic, author and statesman. He is the current [[Governor General of Canada]], the [[List of Governors General of Canada#Governors General of Canada, 1867-present|28th]] since [[Canadian Confederation]].

Johnston was born and raised in [[Ontario]], studying there before enrolling at [[Harvard University]] and later [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Queen's University|Queen's]] Universities. He then went on to work as a professor at various post-secondary institutions in Canada, eventually serving administrative roles as dean of law at the [[University of Western Ontario]], principal of [[McGill University]], and president of the [[University of Waterloo]]. At the same time, Johnston involved himself with politics and public service, moderating political debates and chairing commissions in both the federal and provincial spheres, his most renowned position in that field being the chairmanship of the inquiry into the [[Airbus affair]]. He was in 2010 appointed as governor general by [[Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on the recommendation of [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Stephen Harper]], to replace [[Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean]] as viceroy. At the time, Johnston was predominantly praised as a worthy choice for the Queen's representative, though his appointment was denounced by Quebec sovereigntists.

As governor general, Johnston is entitled to be styled ''[[Excellency#Commonwealth usage|His Excellency]]'' while in office and ''[[The Right Honourable]]'' for the duration of his viceregal tenure and life beyond. Given current practice, he will be sworn into the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] when his term as the Queen's representative ends.

==Early life and education==

==Academic career==
Johnston has had a long academic career, during which he came to specialise in [[securities regulation]], [[corporation law]], [[public policy]] and [[information technology law]].<ref name=CV1 /> After 1966, he worked for two years as an assistant professor at the [[Queen's University Faculty of Law]] and then joined the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Law|University of Toronto's law faculty]], where he taught until 1974, eventually being promoted to the rank of full professor. Johnston was then appointed as dean of the [[Western Law School|University of Western Ontario Law School]], serving between 1974 and 1979, at which time he was elevated to become the fourteenth Principal and Vice-Chancellor of [[McGill University]]. It was during his time in that role that he became acquainted with [[Pierre Trudeau|Pierre]] and [[Margaret Trudeau]], as the Johnston children played with [[Pierre Trudeau#Marriage and children|the Trudeau children]] when the families were at their respective, adjacent cottages in the [[Laurentian Mountains|Laurentians]].<ref name=Record />

Johnston stepped down in 1994 as principal of McGill to remain at the university only as a law professor until he was in 1999 installed as the fifth President of the [[University of Waterloo]]. At that time, the couple acquired a home in [[Wellesley, Ontario|Heidelberg]], Ontario,<ref name=SSF2>{{Citation| title=Lee Myers assumes Chair of Festival's Board of Governors| publisher=Stratford Shakespeare Festival| page=2| date=March 22, 2010| url=http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/uploadedfiles/stratford/media/2010_press_releases/pressreleaseboardchair2010.pdf?n=1408| accessdate=August 6, 2010| ref=CITEREF_Stratford_Shakespeare_Festival_2010}}</ref> and began operating an adjacent horse training ranch, ''Chatterbox Farm''.<ref>{{Citation| last=Morrow| first=Adrian | title=Affable governor-general designate enjoys a town and country life| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=July 10, 2010| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/affable-governor-general-designate-enjoys-a-town-and-country-life/article1635476/| accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref>

|symbolism         = The interlaced pattern symbolizes the central role of family and other relationships in his life, as well as his interest in communication networks and his belief in the interconnectedness of knowledge; it also touches on the importance he puts on order and organization. The crown is the traditional symbol of the Governor general. The books refer to knowledge and education, but also to the law. The five books of the crest stands for Johnston's five daughters, while the candle refers to enlightenment and the transmission of knowledge. The shield's general design and colours are inspired from various Scottish Johnston arms.

The unicorns symbolize dreams, imagination, purity and faithfulness, and their colour stands for Canada. The astrolabe is a reference  to intellectual exploration and the rich background of Canadian explorers going back to [[Jacques Cartier]]. Their winged feet are a traditional attribute of Hermes; in addition to alluding to communication (also referred to in the [[binary code|zeros and ones]], more specifically referring to digital media), they also evoke fitness and sports.  The binary code reflects the flow of information in modern society.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13889&lan=eng| last=Office of the Governor General| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=The Governor General > Governor General David Johnston > Coat of Arms| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref>

The Motto is an allusion to a line in George Bernard Shaw's ''[[Back to Methuselah]]'' ("You see things; and you say, 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say, 'Why not?'").
