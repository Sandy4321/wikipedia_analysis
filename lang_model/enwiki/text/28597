==Etymology==<!--linked-->
{{Main|Rus' people|Rus (name)}}

The name ''Russia'' is derived from [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], a medieval state populated mostly by the [[East Slavs]]. However, this proper name became more prominent in the later history, and the country typically was called by its inhabitants "<U+0420><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0417><U+0435><U+043C><U+043B><U+044F>" (russkaya zemlya), which can be translated as "Russian Land" or "Land of Rus'". In order to distinguish this state from other states derived from it, it is denoted as ''Kievan Rus''' by modern historiography. The [[Rus (name)|name ''Rus'']] itself comes from [[Rus people]], a group of [[Varangians]] (possibly [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedish]] [[Viking]]s)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Russia |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rus |title=Rus <U+2013> definition of Rus by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> who founded the state of [[Kievan Rus|Rus]] (<U+0420><U+0443><U+0441><U+044C>).

An old Latin version of the name Rus' was [[Ruthenia]], mostly applied to the western and southern regions of Rus' that were adjacent to Catholic Europe. The current name of the country, <U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F> (Rossiya), comes from the [[Byzantine Greek]] designation of the Kievan Rus', <U+03A1><U+03C9><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03B1> ''Ross<U+00ED>a''<U+2014>spelt <U+03A1><U+03C9><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03B1> (''Ros<U+00ED>a'' {{IPA-el|ro<U+02C8>sia|pron}}) in [[Modern Greek]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Russians: The People of Europe |last=Milner-Gulland |first=R.

[[File:Kievan Rus en.jpg|thumb|Kievan Rus' in the 11th century]]
The establishment of the first East Slavic states in the 9th century coincided with the arrival of ''[[Varangians]]'', the traders, warriors and settlers from the Baltic Sea region. Primarily they were [[Vikings]] of [[Scandinavia]]n origin, who ventured along the waterways extending from the eastern Baltic [[From the Varangians to the Greeks|to the Black]] [[Volga trade route|and Caspian]] Seas.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Obolensky, D.|title=Byzantium and the Slavs|publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press|year=1994|page=42|isbn=0-88141-008-X}}</ref> According to the [[Primary Chronicle]], a Varangian from [[Rus' people]], named [[Rurik]], was elected ruler of [[Novgorod]] in 862.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic Turkic tribes, such as the [[Kipchaks]] and the [[Pechenegs]], caused a massive migration of Slavic populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north, particularly to the area known as [[Zalesye]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Klyuchevsky, V.|title=The course of the Russian history|volume=1|url=http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kluch/kluch16.htm|isbn=5-244-00072-1|year=1987|publisher=Mysl<U+02B9>}}</ref>

The age of [[feudalism]] and decentralization was marked by constant in-fighting between members of the [[Rurik Dynasty]] that ruled Kievan Rus' collectively. Kiev's dominance waned, to the benefit of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] in the north-east, [[Novgorod Republic]] in the north-west and [[Galicia-Volhynia]] in the south-west.

Ultimately Kievan Rus' disintegrated, with the final blow being the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] of 1237<U+2013>40,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Hamm, M.F.|title=Kiev: A Portrait, 1800<U+2013>1917|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-02585-1|year=1995}}</ref> that resulted in the destruction of Kiev<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> and the death of about half the population of Rus'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parallelsixty.com/history-russia.shtml|title=History of Russia from Early Slavs history and Kievan Rus to Romanovs dynasty|publisher=Parallelsixty.com|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> The invading Mongol elite, together with their conquered Turkic subjects (Cumans, Kipchaks, Bulgars) became known as [[Tatars]], formed the state of the [[Golden Horde]], which pillaged the Russian principalities; the Mongols ruled the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak confederation]] and [[Volga Bulgaria]] (modern-day southern and central expanses of Russia) for over two centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|author=<U+0420><U+044B><U+0431><U+0430><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>, <U+0411>. <U+0410>.|title=<U+0420><U+0435><U+043C><U+0435><U+0441><U+043B><U+043E> <U+0414><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432><U+043D><U+0435><U+0439> <U+0420><U+0443><U+0441><U+0438>|year=1948|pages=525<U+2013>533, 780<U+2013>781}}</ref>

Galicia-Volhynia was eventually assimilated by the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], while the Mongol-dominated Vladimir-Suzdal and Novgorod Republic, two regions on the periphery of Kiev, established the basis for the modern Russian nation.<ref name=Curtis/> The Novgorod together with [[Pskov]] retained some degree of autonomy during the time of the [[Mongol yoke]] and were largely spared the atrocities that affected the rest of the country.

===Grand Duchy of Moscow===
{{Main|Grand Duchy of Moscow}}
[[File:Lissner TroiceSergievaLavr.jpg|thumb|[[Sergius of Radonezh]] blessing [[Dmitry Donskoy]] in [[Trinity Sergius Lavra]], before the [[Battle of Kulikovo]], depicted in a painting by [[Ernst Lissner]]]]

The most powerful successor state to Kievan Rus' was the Grand Duchy of Moscow ("Moscovy" in the Western chronicles), initially a part of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]]. While still under the domain of the Mongol-Tatars and with their connivance, Moscow began to assert its influence in the Central Rus' in the early 14th century, gradually becoming the main leading force in the process of the Rus' lands' reunification and expansion of Russia.

Those were hard times, with frequent [[Mongol-Tatar raids]] and agriculture suffering from the beginning of the [[Little Ice Age]]. As in the rest of Europe, plagues hit Russia somewhere once every five or six years from 1350 to 1490. However, because of the lower population density and better hygiene (widespread practicing of [[banya (sauna)|banya]], the wet steam bath),<ref name=banya>[http://web.archive.org/web/20121130084214/http://sauna-banya.ru/ist.html The history of banya and sauna] {{ru icon}}</ref> the population loss caused by plagues was not so severe as in the Western Europe, and the pre-Plague populations were reached in Russia as early as 1500.<ref>"''[http://books.google.com/books?id=yw3HmjRvVQMC&pg=PA62 Black Death]''". Joseph Patrick Byrne (2004). p. 62. ISBN 0-313-32492-1</ref>

Led by Prince [[Dmitry Donskoy]] of Moscow and helped by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the united army of Russian principalities inflicted a milestone defeat on the Mongol-Tatars in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] in 1380. Moscow gradually absorbed the surrounding principalities, including the formerly strong rivals, such as [[Principality of Tver|Tver]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]].

[[Ivan&nbsp;III]] ("the Great") finally threw off the control of the Golden Horde, consolidated the whole of Central and Northern Rus' under Moscow's dominion, and was the first to take the title "Grand Duke of all the Russias".<ref>{{cite web|author=May, T.|title=Khanate of the Golden Horde|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/history/keller/Mongols/states3.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080607055652/http://www.accd.edu/sac/history/keller/Mongols/states3.html|archivedate=7 June 2008|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Moscow [[Third Rome|claimed succession to the legacy]] of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

===Tsardom of Russia===

The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562<U+2013>604|volume=6|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=219|isbn=0-87569-039-4}}</ref>

During his long reign, Ivan the Terrible nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the [[Volga River]], and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in Southwestern Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], [[Religious denomination|multidenominational]] and [[transcontinental state]].

However, the Tsardom was weakened by the long and unsuccessful [[Livonian War]] against the coalition of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden for access to the Baltic coast and sea trade.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=6|pages=751<U+2013>908|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}</ref> At the same time the Tatars of the [[Crimean Khanate]], the only remaining successor to the Golden Horde, continued to raid Southern Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf |title=The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves.

The death of Ivan's sons marked the end of the ancient [[Rurik Dynasty]] in 1598, and in combination with the [[famine of 1601<U+2013>03]]<ref>{{Cite book|author=Borisenkov, E., Pasetski, V.|title=The thousand-year annals of the extreme meteorological phenomena|isbn=5-244-00212-0|page=190}}</ref> led to the civil war, the rule of pretenders and foreign intervention during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the early 17th century.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=7|pages=461<U+2013>568|isbn=5-17-002142-9}}</ref> [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] occupied parts of Russia, including Moscow. In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by two national heroes, merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov Dynasty]] acceded the throne in 1613 by the decision of Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.

Russia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654<U+2013>1667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670<U+2013>71 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.

In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648, the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].

===Imperial Russia===
{{Main|Russian Empire}}
[[File:Peter der-Grosse 1838.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Peter the Great]], the first [[Emperor of Russia]]]]
Under [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]),<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=9, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/09_01.html|isbn=5-17-002142-9|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> as well as [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]] and [[Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|volume=15, ch.1|url=http://militera.lib.ru/common/solovyev1/15_01.html}}</ref> On the [[Baltic Sea]] Peter founded a new capital called [[Saint Petersburg]], later known as Russia's "Window to Europe". [[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia.

The reign of Peter&nbsp;I's daughter [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]] in 1741<U+2013>62 saw Russia's participation in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756<U+2013>63). During this conflict Russia annexed [[East Prussia]] for a while and even took Berlin. However, upon Elisabeth's death, all these conquests were returned to [[Kingdom of Prussia]] by pro-Prussian [[Peter&nbsp;III of Russia]].

[[Catherine the Great|Catherine&nbsp;II]] ("the Great"), who ruled in 1762<U+2013>96, presided over the Age of [[Russian Enlightenment]]. She extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. In the south, after successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against the Ottoman Empire, Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the [[Crimean Khanate]]. As a result of victories over the Ottomans, by the early 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in [[Transcaucasia]]. This continued with [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I's]] (1801<U+2013>25) wresting of Finland from the weakened kingdom of Sweden in 1809 and of [[Bessarabia]] from the Ottomans in 1812. At the same time Russians [[Russian America|colonized Alaska]] and even founded settlements in California, like [[Fort Ross]].

In 1803<U+2013>06, the [[first Russian circumnavigation]] was made, later followed by other notable Russian sea exploration voyages. In 1820 [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|a Russian expedition]] discovered the continent of [[Antarctica]].

[[File:Russian Empire (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|The Russian Empire in 1866 and its spheres of influence]]
In alliances with various European countries, Russia fought against [[Napoleon]]'s France. The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian Winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]] perished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ruling the Empire|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/5.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Barclay de Tolly]], the Russian army ousted Napoleon from the country and drove through Europe in the [[war of the Sixth Coalition]], finally entering Paris. Alexander&nbsp;I headed Russia's delegation at the [[Congress of Vienna]] that defined the map of post-Napoleonic Europe.

The officers of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] brought ideas of liberalism back to Russia with them and attempted to curtail the tsar's powers during the abortive [[Decembrist revolt]] of 1825. At the end of the conservative reign of [[Nicolas&nbsp;I]] (1825<U+2013>55), a zenith period of Russia's power and influence in Europe was disrupted by defeat in the [[Crimean War]]. Between 1847 and 1851, a massive wave of Asiatic [[cholera]] swept over Russia, claiming about one million lives.<ref>Geoffrey A. Hosking (2001). "''[http://books.google.com/books?id=oh-5AAmboMUC&pg=PA9 Russia and the Russians: a history]''". Harvard University Press. p. 9. ISBN 0-674-00473-6</ref>

Nicholas's successor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;II]] (1855<U+2013>81) enacted significant changes in the country, including the [[emancipation reform of 1861]]. These ''Great Reforms'' spurred industrialization and modernized the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in [[1877<U+2013>78 Russo-Turkish War]].

The late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&nbsp;II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son
[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881<U+2013>94) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894<U+2013>1917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms, including granting the [[freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]]. Migration to [[Siberia]] increased rapidly in the early 20th century, particularly during the [[Stolypin reform|Stolypin agrarian reform]]. Between 1906 and 1914 more than four million settlers arrived in that region.<ref>N. M. Dronin, E.&nbsp;G. Bellinger (2005).

In 1914, Russia entered [[World War&nbsp;I]] in response to Austria-Hungary's declaration of war on Russia's ally Serbia, and fought across multiple fronts while isolated from its [[Triple Entente]] allies. In 1916, the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Russian Army almost completely destroyed the military of [[Austria-Hungary]]. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, carried out in two major acts.

===Revolution and Russian Republic===
{{Main|February Revolution|Russian Provisional Government|Russian Republic}}
[[File:Lenintribune.jpg|left|thumb|[[Vladimir Lenin]], the leader of the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]]]
The [[February Revolution]] forced Nicholas&nbsp;II to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Ipatiev House|later executed]] during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The monarchy was replaced by a shaky coalition of political parties that declared itself the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. An alternative socialist establishment existed alongside, the [[Petrograd Soviet]], wielding power through the democratically elected councils of workers and peasants, called ''[[Soviet (council)|Soviets]]''. The rule of the new authorities only aggravated the crisis in the country, instead of resolving it. Eventually, the [[October Revolution]], led by [[Bolshevik]] leader [[Vladimir Lenin]], overthrew the Provisional Government and gave full governing power to the Soviets, leading to the creation of the world's first [[socialist state]].

Following the October Revolution, a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] broke out between the [[anti-communist]] [[White movement]] and the new [[Workers' council|Soviet]] regime with its [[Red Army]]. Bolshevist Russia lost its Ukrainian, Polish, Baltic, and Finnish territories by signing the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that concluded hostilities with the [[Central Powers]] of World War&nbsp;I. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] launched an unsuccessful [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|military intervention]] in support of anti-Communist forces. In the meantime both the Bolsheviks and White movement carried out campaigns of deportations and executions against each other, known respectively as the [[Red Terror]] and [[White Terror]].

Out of the 15 [[republics of the USSR|republics that would make up the USSR]], the largest in size and over half of the total USSR population was the Russian SFSR, which came to dominate the union for its entire 69-year history.

Following Lenin's death in 1924, a [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union#List of troikas|troika]] was designated to govern the Soviet Union. However, [[Joseph Stalin]], an elected [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]], managed to suppress all opposition groups within the party and consolidate power in his hands. [[Leon Trotsky]], the main proponent of [[world revolution]], was exiled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and Stalin's idea of [[Socialism in One Country]] became the primary line. The continued internal struggle in the Bolshevik party culminated in the [[Great Purge]], a period of mass repressions in 1937<U+2013>38, during which hundreds of thousands of people were executed, including [[Old Bolshevik|original party members]] and military leaders accused of [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] plots.<ref>Abbott Gleason (2009).

[[File:Red Army greeted in Bucharest.jpg|thumb|left|The Red Army is greeted in [[Bucharest]] in August 1944]]
Under Stalin's leadership, the government launched a [[planned economy]], industrialisation of the largely rural country, and [[Collectivization in the USSR|collectivization]] of its agriculture. During this period of rapid economic and social change, millions of people were sent to [[Gulag|penal labor camps]],<ref name="Getty">Getty, Rittersporn, Zemskov.

''The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931<U+2013>33'', p. 401.</ref> The Soviet Union, though with a heavy price, was transformed from a largely agrarian economy to a major industrial powerhouse in a short span of time.

The [[Appeasement]] policy of Great Britain and France towards [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] enlarged the might of [[Nazi Germany]] and put a threat of war to the Soviet Union. Around the same time the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] allied with the [[Empire of Japan]], a rival of the USSR in the Far East and an open enemy of the USSR in the [[Soviet<U+2013>Japanese Border Wars]] in 1938<U+2013>39.

In August 1939, after another failure of attempts to establish an anti-Nazi alliance with Britain and France, the Soviet government decided to improve relations with Germany by concluding the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], pledging non-aggression between the two countries and dividing their spheres of influence in Eastern Europe. While Hitler conquered Poland, France and other countries actied on single front at the start of [[World War&nbsp;II]], the USSR was able to build up its military and claim some of the former territories of the Russian Empire as a result of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], [[Winter War]] and the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|occupation of the Baltic states]].

The [[Red Army]] occupied Eastern Europe after the war, including [[East Germany]]. Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and, later on, the [[Republic of Cuba]]. Significant amounts of the Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.<ref>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''.

After Stalin's death and a short period of [[Collective leadership|collective rule]], new leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] denounced the [[cult of personality]] of Stalin and launched the policy of [[de-Stalinization]]. The penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated (many of them posthumously).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916205-2,00.html|work=TIME|accessdate=1 August 2008|title=Great Escapes from the Gulag|date=5 June 1978}}</ref> The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the U.S. [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in Turkey and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]].

In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]]. Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth aboard ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' manned spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].
[[File:Sputnik asm.jpg|left|thumb|[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]] was the world's first artificial satellite]]

Following the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of 1970s and the early 1980s was designated later as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a period when the economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]], aimed for partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifted the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]], but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.

In 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet forces entered]] that country at request of the new regime. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.

From 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to democratise the government. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements. Prior to 1991, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact90/world12.txt|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=9 March 2008|title=1990 CIA World Factbook}}</ref> but during its last years it was afflicted by shortages of goods in grocery stores, huge budget deficits, and explosive growth in money supply leading to inflation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/russia/economy/russia_economy_unforeseen_results_o~1315.html|title=Russia Unforeseen Results of Reform|publisher=The Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Factbook|accessdate=10 March 2008}}</ref>

By 1991, economic and political turmoil began to boil over, as the Baltic republics chose to secede from the Union. On 17 March, a [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|referendum]] was held, to which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of preserving the Soviet Union as a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|a coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Despite the will expressed by the people, on 25 December 1991, the USSR [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|was dissolved]] into 15 [[post-Soviet states]].

[[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected the [[President of Russia]] in June 1991, in the first direct presidential election in Russian history.

The 1990s were plagued by armed conflicts in the [[North Caucasus]], both local ethnic skirmishes and separatist [[Islamist]] insurrections. From the time [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists declared independence in the early 1990s, an [[First Chechen War|intermittent guerrilla war]] has been fought between the rebel groups and the Russian military. [[Terrorism in Russia|Terrorist attacks against civilians]] carried out by separatists, most notably the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] and [[Beslan school siege]], caused hundreds of deaths and drew worldwide attention.

Russia took up the responsibility for settling the USSR's external debts, even though its population made up just half of the population of the USSR at the time of its dissolution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia pays off USSR's entire debt, sets to become crediting country|publisher=Pravda.ru|url=http://english.pravda.ru/russia/economics/22-08-2006/84038-paris-club-0|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> High budget deficits caused the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/aslund0108.pdf|title=Russia's Capitalist Revolution|author=Aslund A|accessdate=28 March 2008|format=PDF}}</ref> and resulted in a further GDP decline.<ref name=OECD>{{cite web|title=Russian Federation|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/7/50/2452793.pdf|accessdate=24 February 2008|format=PDF}}</ref>

Putin [[Second Chechen War|suppressed the Chechen insurgency]], although sporadic violence still occurs throughout the Northern Caucasus.

===Governance===
[[File:Moscow Kremlin from Kamenny bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moscow Kremlin]], the working residence of the [[President of Russia]]]]

According to the [[Constitution of Russia]], the country is a federation and [[semi-presidential]] republic, wherein the President is the [[head of state]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 80, <U+00A7>1)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> and the [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. The Russian Federation is fundamentally structured as a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[representative democracy]], with the federal government composed of three branches:
* Legislative: The [[bicameral]] [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], made up of the 450-member [[State Duma]] and the 166-member [[Federation Council]], adopts [[federal law]], [[declaration of war|declares war]], approves treaties, has the [[power of the purse]] and the power of [[impeachment]] of the President.
* Executive: The [[President of Russia|President]] is the [[Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces]], can veto [[legislative bill]]s before they become law, and appoints the [[Government of Russia]] (Cabinet) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies.
* [[Judiciary of Russia|Judiciary]]: The [[Constitutional Court of Russia|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]], [[Supreme Court of Arbitration]] and lower federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the Federation Council on the recommendation of the President, interpret laws and can overturn laws they deem [[unconstitutional]].

The president is elected by popular vote for a six-year term (eligible for a second term, but not for a third consecutive term).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the Russian Federation|work=(Article 81, <U+00A7>3)|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> Ministries of the government are composed of the Premier and his deputies, ministers, and selected other individuals; all are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Prime Minister (whereas the appointment of the latter requires the consent of the State Duma). Leading political parties in Russia include [[United Russia]], the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]], the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], and [[A Just Russia]].

An important aspect of Russia's relations with the West is the criticism of Russia's political system and human rights management by the Western governments, the mass media and the leading democracy and human rights watchdogs. In particular, such organisations as the [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] consider Russia to have not enough democratic attributes and to allow few political rights and civil liberties to its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/russia/report-2009|title=Amnesty International report on Russia|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref><ref>Human Rights Watch on Russia and Chechnya [http://www.hrw.org/en/video/2008/04/06/russia-trial HTW.org]</ref> [[Freedom House]], an international organisation funded by the United States, ranks Russia as "not free", citing "carefully engineered elections" and "absence" of debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2009&country=7689|title=Annual report Russia|publisher=Freedom House|date=10 May 2004|accessdate=27 April 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref> Russian authorities dismiss these claims and especially criticise Freedom House. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the 2006 ''[[Freedom in the World]]'' report "prefabricated", stating that the human rights issues have been turned into a political weapon in particular by the United States.

Federal subjects are grouped into eight [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]], each administered by an envoy appointed by the President of Russia.<ref>''Russian Classification of Economic Regions'' (OK&nbsp;024<U+2013>95) of 1 January 1997 as amended by the Amendments #1/1998 through #5/2001. (Section&nbsp;I. Federal Districts)</ref> Unlike the federal subjects, the federal districts are not a subnational level of government, but are a level of administration of the federal government. Federal districts' envoys serve as liaisons between the federal subjects and the federal government and are primarily responsible for overseeing the compliance of the federal subjects with the federal laws.

==Geography==

{{See also|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Russland Relief.png|thumb|The topography of Russia]]
Russia is the [[largest country in the world]]; its total area is {{convert|17075400|km2|sqmi}}. There are 23 UNESCO [[World Heritage Sites in Russia]], 40 UNESCO [[biosphere reserve]]s,<ref>{{cite web|last=The World Network of Biosphere Reserves<U+2014>UNESCO|title=Russian Federation|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref> 41 [[National parks of Russia|national parks]] and 101 [[Zapovednik|nature reserves]]. It lies between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41<U+00B0>]] and [[82nd parallel north|82<U+00B0> N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian east|19<U+00B0> E]] and [[169th meridian west|169<U+00B0> W]].

Russia has a wide natural resource base, including major deposits of timber, petroleum, natural gas, coal, ores and other mineral resources.

===Topography===
The two widest separated points in Russia are about {{convert|8000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart along a [[geodesic]] line. These points are: the boundary with Poland on a {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long [[Vistula Spit]] separating the [[Gda<U+0144>sk Bay]] from the [[Vistula Lagoon]]; and the farthest southeast of the [[Kuril Islands]]. The points which are furthest separated in [[longitude]] are {{convert|6600|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} apart along a geodesic line. These points are: in the west, the same spit; in the east, the [[Big Diomede Island]]. The Russian Federation spans 9 [[time zone]]s.

[[File:Elbrus North 195.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Elbrus]], the highest point of the [[Caucasus]], Russia and Europe]]
Most of Russia consists of vast stretches of plains that are predominantly [[steppe]] to the south and heavily forested to the north, with [[tundra]] along the northern coast. Russia possesses 10% of the world's [[arable land]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oil prices drive the cost of food|publisher=RIA Novosti|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080222/99853566.html|accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref> Mountain ranges are found along the southern borders, such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] (containing [[Mount Elbrus]], which at {{convert|5642|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in both Russia and Europe) and the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] (containing [[Mount Belukha]], which at the {{convert|4506|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point of Siberia outside of the [[Russian Far East]]); and in the eastern parts, such as the [[Verkhoyansk Range]] or the volcanoes of [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] (containing [[Klyuchevskaya Sopka]], which at the {{convert|4750|m|0|abbr=on}} is the highest [[active volcano]] in Eurasia as well as the highest point of [[Asian Russia]]). The [[Ural Mountains]], rich in mineral resources, form a north-south range that divides Europe and Asia.

Russia has an extensive coastline of over {{convert|37000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, as well as along the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Sea of Azov]], [[Black Sea]] and [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name=cia>{{cite web|last=The World Factbook|title=CIA|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rs.html|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref> The [[Barents Sea]], [[White Sea]], [[Kara Sea]], [[Laptev Sea]], [[East Siberian Sea]], [[Chukchi Sea]], [[Bering Sea]], [[Sea of Okhotsk]], and the [[Sea of Japan]] are linked to Russia via the Arctic and Pacific. Russia's major islands and archipelagos include [[Novaya Zemlya]], the [[Franz Josef Land]], the [[Severnaya Zemlya]], the [[New Siberian Islands]], [[Wrangel Island]], the [[Kuril Islands]], and [[Sakhalin]]. The [[Diomede Islands]] (one controlled by Russia, the other by the U.S.) are just {{convert|3|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} apart, and [[Kunashir Island]] is about {{convert|20|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from [[Hokkaido]], Japan.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Russia}}
[[File:Archangelsk taiga.JPG|thumb|[[Taiga]] forest in winter, [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]]]]
The enormous size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the [[humid continental climate]], which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southeast. Mountains in the south obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian Ocean, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.<ref name=congress>{{cite web|title=Climate|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/24.htm|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>

Most of Northern European Russia and Siberia has a [[subarctic climate]], with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly the [[Sakha Republic]], where the Northern [[Pole of Cold]] is located with the record low temperature of {{convert|<U+2212>71.2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|disp=or}}), and more moderate elsewhere. The strip of land along the shore of the Arctic Ocean, as well as the [[Russian Arctic islands]], have a [[polar climate]].

The coastal part of [[Krasnodar Krai]] on the Black Sea, most notably in [[Sochi]], possesses a [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild and wet winters. Winter is dry compared to summer in many regions of East Siberia and the Far East, while other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some areas of southernmost Siberia, possesses a [[semi-arid climate]].

[[File:TransSiberianRailwayAtKm9288.jpg|thumb|upright|The marker for kilometre 9288 at the end of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] in [[Vladivostok]]]]
Railway transport in Russia is mostly under the control of the state-run [[Russian Railways]] monopoly. The company accounts for over 3.6% of Russia's GDP and handles 39% of the total freight traffic (including pipelines) and more than 42% of passenger traffic.<ref name=rzd>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.rzd.ru/isvp/public/rzdeng?STRUCTURE_ID=4|title=Russian Railways|publisher=Eng.rzd.ru|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref> The total length of common-used railway tracks exceeds {{convert|85500|km|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=rzd/> second only to the United States.

Much of Russia's inland waterways, which [[List of countries by waterways length|total {{convert|102000|km|0|abbr=on}}]], are made up of natural rivers or lakes. In the European part of the country the network of channels connects the basins of major rivers. Russia's capital, Moscow, is sometimes called "the [[port]] of the five seas", because of its waterway connections to the Baltic, [[White Sea|White]], Caspian, [[Azov Sea|Azov]] and [[Black Sea]]s.

[[File:NSF picture of Yamal.gif|thumb|''[[Yamal (icebreaker)|Yamal]]'', one of Russia's [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s ([http://englishrussia.com/index.php/2008/03/31/russian-atomic-icebreakers/ gallery])]]
Major sea ports of Russia include [[Rostov-on-Don]] on the Azov Sea, [[Novorossiysk]] on the Black Sea, [[Astrakhan]] and [[Makhachkala]] on the Caspian, [[Kaliningrad]] and St Petersburg on the Baltic, [[Arkhangelsk]] on the White Sea, [[Murmansk]] on the Barents Sea, [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] and [[Vladivostok]] on the Pacific Ocean. In 2008 the country owned 1,448 [[Merchant marine by country|merchant marine]] ships. The world's only fleet of [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s advances the economic exploitation of the Arctic [[continental shelf of Russia]] and the development of sea trade through the [[Northern Sea Route]] between Europe and East Asia.

By [[total length of pipelines]] Russia is second only to the United States. Currently many new pipeline projects are being realized, including [[Nord Stream]] and [[South Stream]] natural gas pipelines to Europe, and the [[Eastern Siberia <U+2013> Pacific Ocean oil pipeline]] (ESPO) to the Russian Far East and China.

Russia has 1,216 airports,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2053rank.html |title=CIA The World Factbook<U+2013>Rank Order<U+2013>Airports |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=19 January 2011}}</ref> the busiest being [[Sheremetyevo]], [[Domodedovo International Airport|Domodedovo]], and [[Vnukovo]] in Moscow, and [[Pulkovo Airport|Pulkovo]] in St. Petersburg.

Typically, major Russian cities have well-developed systems of public transport, with the most common varieties of exploited vehicles being bus, [[trolleybus]] and tram. Seven Russian cities, namely [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg Metro|Saint Petersburg]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Metro|Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Novosibirsk Metro|Novosibirsk]], [[Samara Metro|Samara]], [[Yekaterinburg Metro|Yekaterinburg]], and [[Kazan Metro|Kazan]], have underground metros, while [[Volgograd]] features a [[Volgograd Metrotram|metrotram]]. The [[total length of metros]] in Russia is {{Convert|465.4|km|mi}}. Moscow Metro and Saint Petersburg Metro are the oldest in Russia, opened in 1935 and 1955 respectively. These two are among the fastest and [[busiest metro systems]] in the world, and are famous for rich decorations and unique designs of their stations, which is a common tradition on Russian metros and railways.

===Science and technology===
{{Main|Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records|Science and technology in Russia|List of Russian scientists|List of Russian inventors}}
[[File:Lomonosovportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikhail Lomonosov]], [[polymath]] scientist, inventor, poet and artist]]
Science and technology in Russia blossomed since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], when [[Peter the Great]] founded the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]], and [[polymath]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] established the [[Moscow State University]], paving the way for a strong native tradition in learning and innovation. In the 19th and 20th centuries the country produced a large number of notable scientists and inventors.

The [[Russian physics school]] began with Lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the [[energy conservation law]]. Russian discoveries and inventions in physics include the [[electric arc]], electrodynamical [[Lenz's law]], [[space groups]] of [[crystal]]s, [[photoelectric cell]], [[Cherenkov radiation]], [[electron paramagnetic resonance]], [[heterotransistor]]s and [[3D holography]]. [[Laser]]s and [[maser]]s were co-invented by [[Nikolai Basov]] and [[Alexander Prokhorov]], while the idea of [[tokamak]] for controlled [[nuclear fusion]] was introduced by [[Igor Tamm]], [[Andrei Sakharov]] and [[Lev Artsimovich]], leading eventually the modern international [[ITER]] project, where Russia is a party.

Since the time of [[Nikolay Lobachevsky]] (the "[[Copernicus]] of [[Geometry]]" who pioneered the [[non-Euclidean geometry]]) and a prominent tutor [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], the [[Russian mathematical school]] became one of the most influential in the world.<ref>{{cite book|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-9810243906|url=http://books.google.com/books/about/Russian_Mathematicians_in_the_20th_Centu.html?id=BFsnWXkqZaMC|editor=Yakov Sinai}}</ref> Chebyshev's students included [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], who founded the modern [[stability theory]], and [[Andrey Markov]] who invented the [[Markov chain]]s. In the 20th century Soviet mathematicians, such as [[Andrey Kolmogorov]], [[Israel Gelfand]], and [[Sergey Sobolev]], made major contributions to various areas of mathematics. Nine Soviet/Russian mathematicians were awarded with [[Fields Medal]], a most prestigious award in mathematics. Recently [[Grigori Perelman]] was offered the first ever Clay [[Millennium Prize Problems]] Award for his final proof of the [[Poincar<U+00E9> conjecture]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claymath.org/poincare/index.html |title=The Poincar<U+00E9> Conjecture |publisher=Claymath.org |date= |accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Soyuz TMA-2 launch.jpg|thumb|upright|Soyuz TMA-2 launch.jpg|[[Soyuz TMA-2|Soyuz TMA&8209;2]] is launched from [[Baikonur]], [[Kazakhstan]], carrying one of the first resident crews to the [[International Space Station]]]]
[[Russian chemist]] [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] invented the [[Periodic table]], the main framework of modern [[chemistry]]. [[Aleksandr Butlerov]] was one of the creators of the theory of [[chemical structure]], playing a central role in [[organic chemistry]]. [[Russian biologists]] include [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]] who discovered viruses, [[Ivan Pavlov]] who was the first to experiment with the [[classical conditioning]], and [[Ilya Mechnikov]] who was a pioneer researcher of the [[immune system]] and [[probiotics]].

Many Russian scientists and inventors were [[<U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>s]], like [[Igor Sikorsky]], who built the first [[airliner]]s and modern-type helicopters; [[Vladimir Zworykin]], often called the father of TV; chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], noted for his work on [[dissipative structures]] and [[complex systems]]; Nobel Prize-winning economists [[Simon Kuznets]] and [[Wassily Leontief]]; physicist [[Georgiy Gamov]] (an author of the [[Big Bang]] theory) and social scientist [[Pitirim Sorokin]]. Many foreigners worked in Russia for a long time, like [[Leonard Euler]] and [[Alfred Nobel]].

[[Russian inventions]] include the [[arc welding]] by [[Nikolay Benardos]], further developed by [[Nikolay Slavyanov]], [[Konstantin Khrenov]] and other Russian engineers. [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] invented the [[knapsack parachute]], while [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] introduced the [[pressure suit]]. [[Alexander Lodygin]] and [[Pavel Yablochkov]] were pioneers of [[electric lighting]], and [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] introduced the first [[three-phase electric power]] systems, widely used today. [[Sergei Vasiljevich Lebedev|Sergei Lebedev]] invented the first commercially viable and mass-produced type of [[synthetic rubber]]. The first [[ternary computer]], ''[[Setun]]'', was developed by [[Nikolay Brusentsov]].

In the 20th century a number of prominent [[Soviet aerospace engineers]], inspired by the fundamental works of [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], [[Sergei Chaplygin]] and others, designed many hundreds of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of ''KBs'' (''Construction Bureaus'') that now constitute the bulk of Russian [[United Aircraft Corporation]]. Famous Russian aircraft include the civilian [[Tupolev|Tu]]-series, [[Sukhoi|Su]] and [[MiG|MiG fighter aircraft]], [[Kamov|Ka]] and [[Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant|Mi]]-series helicopters; many Russian aircraft models are on the [[list of most produced aircraft]] in history.

[[File:Yo-conc3.JPG|thumb|left|[[Yo-mobil]], a new Russian [[hybrid car]]]]
With all these achievements, however, since the late Soviet era Russia was lagging behind the West in a number of technologies, mostly those related to [[energy conservation]] and [[consumer goods]] production. The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of the state support for science and a [[brain drain]] migration from Russia.

In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government [[Medvedev modernisation programme|launched a campaign]] aimed into modernisation and [[innovation]]. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev formulated top priorities for the country's technological development:
* [[Efficient energy use]]
* [[Information technology]], including both common products and the products combined with [[space technology]]
* [[Nuclear power|Nuclear energy]]
* [[Pharmaceuticals]]<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091011/156428675.html Medvedev outlines priorities for Russian economy's modernization] RIA Novosti</ref>

Currently Russia has completed the [[GLONASS]] [[satellite navigation system]]. The country is developing its own [[Sukhoi PAK FA|fifth-generation jet fighter]] and constructing the first serial [[mobile nuclear plant]] in the world. In 2010, an economy class [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid electric car]] project was introduced, called [[Yo-mobil]], that will be mass-produced by <U+00EB>-Auto, a Russian company that is a joint venture between truck maker Yarovit and the Onexim investment group.<ref name="nytimes">{{cite news|title=Russian Billionaire Backs New Hybrid Car|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/business/global/14hybrid14.html?_r=1&hpw|work=The New York Times|accessdate=14 December 2010|date=13 December 2010|first=Andrew E.|last=Kramer}}</ref><ref name="npr">{{cite web|title=Yo!

[[File:Mir on 12 June 1998edit1.jpg|thumb|Soviet and Russian [[space station]] [[Mir]]]]

===Space exploration===
Russian achievements in the field of [[space technology]] and [[space exploration]] are traced back to [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], the father of theoretical [[astronautics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiaa.org/index.cfm|title=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|publisher=Aiaa.org|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref> His works had inspired leading [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rocket engineers, such as [[Sergey Korolyov]], [[Valentin Glushko]], and many others who contributed to the success of the [[Soviet space program]] on early stages of the [[Space Race]] and beyond.

In 1957 the first Earth-orbiting artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', was launched; in 1961 the first human trip into space was successfully made by [[Yury Gagarin]]. Many other Soviet and Russian [[space exploration records]] ensued, including the first [[spacewalk]] performed by [[Alexey Leonov]], [[Luna&nbsp;9]] was the first spacecraft to land on the [[Moon]], [[Venera&nbsp;7]] was the first to land on another planet ([[Venus]]), [[Mars&nbsp;3]] then the first to land on [[Mars]], the first [[space exploration rover]] ''[[Lunokhod-1|Lunokhod&8209;1]]'' and the first [[space station]] ''[[Salyut&nbsp;1]]'' and ''[[Mir]]''.

After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], some government-funded space exploration programs, including the [[Buran programme|Buran]] space shuttle program, were cancelled or delayed, while participation of the Russian space industry in commercial activities and international cooperation intensified.
Nowadays Russia is the largest satellite launcher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/2009.html|title=Russian space program in 2009: plans and reality|publisher=Russianspaceweb.com|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> After the U.S. [[Space Shuttle]] program ended in 2011, [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rockets]] became the only provider of transport for astronauts at the [[International Space Station]].

There are over 160 different ethnic groups and indigenous peoples in Russia.<ref name=ethnicgroups/> Ethnic [[Russians]] with their [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] traditions, [[Tatars]] and [[Bashkirs]] with their Turkic Muslim culture, [[Buddhist]] [[nomadic]] [[Buryats]] and [[Kalmyks]], [[Shamanistic]] peoples of the [[Extreme North]] and Siberia, highlanders of the [[Northern Caucasus]], [[Finno-Ugric peoples]] of the [[Russian North West]] and [[Volga Region]] all contribute to the cultural diversity of the country.

[[Handicraft]], like [[Dymkovo toy]], [[khokhloma]], [[gzhel]] and [[palekh miniature]] represent an important aspect of Russian [[folk culture]]. Ethnic Russian clothes include [[kaftan]], [[kosovorotka]] and [[ushanka]] for men, [[sarafan]] and [[kokoshnik]] for women, with [[lapti]] and [[valenki]] as common shoes. The clothes of [[Cossack]]s from Southern Russia include [[Burka (Caucasus)|burka]] and [[papaha]], which they share with the peoples of the Northern Caucasus.

[[Russian cuisine]] widely uses fish, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of [[rye]], wheat, [[barley]], and [[millet]] provide the ingredients for various breads, [[pancakes]] and cereals, as well as for [[kvass]], beer and vodka drinks. [[Black bread]] is rather popular in Russia, compared to the rest of the world. Flavourful soups and stews include [[shchi]], [[borsch]], [[ukha]], [[solyanka]] and [[okroshka]]. [[Smetana (dairy product)|Smetana]] (a heavy [[sour cream]]) is often added to soups and salads. [[Pirozhki]], [[blini]] and [[syrniki]] are native types of pancakes.

Other meat dishes include stuffed cabbage rolls ''([[golubtsy]])'' usually filled with meat.<ref name="mrig-golubtsy">{{cite web|url=http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/how-to-cook-golubtzy.html |title=How to Cook Golubtzy|publisher=Moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com |date=6 August 2011 |accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> Salads include [[Olivier salad]], [[Vinaigrette]] and [[Dressed herring]].

Russia's large number of ethnic groups have distinctive traditions regarding [[Music of Russia#Ethnic roots music|folk music]]. Typical ethnic Russian musical instruments are [[gusli]], [[balalaika]], [[zhaleika]], and [[garmoshka]]. Folk music had a significant influence on Russian classical composers, and in modern times it is a source of inspiration for a number of popular [[folk band]]s, like [[Melnitsa]]. [[Russian folk songs]], as well as patriotic [[Soviet songs]], constitute the bulk of the repertoire of the world-renown [[Red Army choir]] and other popular ensembles.

Russians have [[Russian traditions|many traditions]], including the washing in [[banya (sauna)|banya]], a hot steam bath somewhat similar to [[sauna]].<ref name="banya"/> Old [[Russian folklore]] takes its roots in the pagan [[Slavic mythology|Slavic religion]].

After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.

The 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].

In 1955, a new Soviet leader, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], condemned the "excesses" of the former academic architecture,<ref>Russian: <U+041F><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0426><U+041A> <U+041A><U+041F><U+0421><U+0421> <U+0438> <U+0421><U+041C> <U+0421><U+0421><U+0421><U+0420> "<U+041E><U+0431> <U+0443><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0438><U+0437><U+043B><U+0438><U+0448><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432> <U+0432> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0438> <U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435>", 04.11.1955 (Khrushchev's decree ''On liquidation of excesses...'') {{ru icon}}</ref> and the late Soviet era was dominated by plain [[functionalism in architecture]]. This helped somewhat to resolve the housing problem, but created a large quantity of buildings of low architectural quality, much in contrast with the previous bright styles. The situation improved in the recent two decades. Many temples demolished in Soviet times were rebuilt, and this process continues along with the restoration of various historical buildings destroyed in World War&nbsp;II. A total of 23,000 Orthodox churches have been rebuilt between 1991<U+2013>2010, which effectively quadrapled the number of operating churches in Russia.<ref>[http://www.en.rian.ru/art_living/20101203/161616486.html Over 20,000 churches rebuilt in Russia in 20 years <U+2013> Patriarch Kirill] [[RIA Novosti]]</ref>

===Visual arts===
{{Main|Russian artists}}
[[File:Andrej Rubl<U+00EB>v 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Trinity (Rublev)|Trinity]]'' icon by [[Andrei Rublev]]]]

Early Russian painting is represented in [[Russian icons|icons]] and vibrant [[fresco]]s, the two genres inherited from [[Byzantium]]. As Moscow rose to power, [[Theophanes the Greek]], [[Dionisius]] and [[Andrei Rublev]] became vital names associated with a distinctly Russian art.

The [[Russian Academy of Arts]] was created in 1757<ref>[http://en.rah.ru/content/en/section-academy-en.html Russian Academy of Arts] official site.</ref> and gave Russian artists an international role and status. [[Ivan Argunov]], [[Dmitry Levitzky]], [[Vladimir Borovikovsky]] and other 18th century academicians mostly focused on [[portrait painting]]. In the early 19th century, when [[neoclassicism]] and [[romantism]] flourished, mythological and Biblical themes inspired many prominent paintings, notably by [[Karl Briullov]] and [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]].

In the mid-19th century the ''[[Peredvizhniki]]'' (''Wanderers'') group of artists broke with the Academy and initiated a school of art liberated from academic restrictions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gray|first=Camilla|title=Russian Experiment in Art|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|year=2002|page=9}}</ref> These were mostly [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] painters who captured Russian identity in landscapes of wide rivers, forests, and birch clearings, as well as vigorous genre scenes and robust portraits of their contemporaries. Some artists focused on depicting dramatic moments in Russian history, while others turned to [[social criticism]], showing the conditions of the poor and caricaturing authority; [[critical realism]] flourished under the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. Leading realists include [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], [[Ivan Kramskoi]], [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Vasily Surikov]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Ilya Repin]], and [[Boris Kustodiev]].

The turn of the 20th century saw the rise of [[symbolism (art)|symbolist]] painting, represented by [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], and [[Nicholas Roerich]].

The [[Russian avant-garde]] was a large, influential wave of [[modernist art]] that flourished in Russia from approximately 1890 to 1930. The term covers many separate, but inextricably related art movements that occurred at the time, namely [[neo-primitivism]], [[suprematism]], [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]], [[rayonism]], and [[Russian Futurism]]. Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].

Soviet art produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country. Soviet artists often combined innovation with socialist realism, notably the sculptors [[Vera Mukhina]], [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]] and [[Ernst Neizvestny]].

Music in 19th century Russia was defined by the tension between classical composer [[Mikhail Glinka]] along with other members of [[The Mighty Handful]], who embraced Russian national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions, and the [[Russian Musical Society]] led by composers [[Anton Rubinstein|Anton]] and [[Nikolay Rubinstein]]s, which was musically conservative. The later tradition of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], was continued into the 20th century by [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Norris, Gregory; ed.

Russian conservatories have turned out generations of famous soloists. Among the best known are violinists [[David Oistrakh]] and [[Gidon Kremer]]; cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]]; pianists [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]], and [[Emil Gilels]]; and vocalists [[Fyodor Shalyapin]], [[Galina Vishnevskaya]], [[Anna Netrebko]] and [[Dmitry Hvorostovsky]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Russia::Music|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|accessdate=5 October 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia/38636/Music}}</ref>

During the early 20th century, Russian ballet dancers [[Anna Pavlova]] and [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] rose to fame, and impresario [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and his [[Ballets Russes]]' travels abroad profoundly influenced the development of dance worldwide.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Garafola, L|title=Diaghilev's Ballets Russes|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=576|isbn=0-19-505701-5|year=1989}}</ref> Soviet ballet preserved the perfected 19th century traditions,<ref>{{cite web|author=Cashin, K K|title=Alexander Pushkin's Influence on Russian Ballet<U+2014>Chapter Five: Pushkin, Soviet Ballet, and Afterward|url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04072005-133328/unrestricted/12_kkc_chap5.pdf|accessdate=27 December 2007|format=PDF}}</ref> and the Soviet Union's choreography schools produced many internationally famous stars, including [[Maya Plisetskaya]], [[Rudolf Nureyev]], and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]].

Modern [[Russian rock]] music takes its roots both in the Western [[rock and roll]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and in traditions of the [[Russian bards]] of the Soviet era, such as [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Bulat Okudzhava]].<ref>[http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/music/380/#r1 History of Rock Music in Russia] at Russia-InfoCentre</ref> Popular Russian rock groups include [[Mashina Vremeni]], [[DDT (band)|DDT]], [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]], [[Alisa]], [[Kino (band)|Kino]], [[Kipelov]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]], [[Aria (band)|Aria]], [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]], [[Splean]] and [[Korol i Shut]]. [[Russian pop]] music developed from what was known in the Soviet times as ''estrada'' into full-fledged industry, with some performers gaining wide international recognition, such as [[t.A.T.u.]], [[Nu Virgos]] and [[Vitas]].

===Literature and philosophy===
{{Main|Russian literature|Russian philosophy|Russian poets|Russian playwrights|Russian novelists|Russian science fiction and fantasy}}
[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leo Tolstoy]], novelist and philosopher]]
In the 18th century, during the era of [[Russian Enlightenment]], the development of [[Russian literature]] was boosted by the works of [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] and [[Denis Fonvizin]]. By the early 19th century a modern native tradition had emerged, producing some of the greatest writers in Russian history. This period, known also as the [[Golden Age of Russian Poetry]], began with [[Alexander Pushkin]], who is considered the founder of the modern Russian literary language and often described as the "Russian Shakespeare".<ref>{{Cite book|author=Kelly, C|title=Russian Literature: A Very Short Introduction (Paperback)|publisher=Oxford Paperbacks|isbn=0-19-280144-9|year=2001}}</ref> It continued into the 19th century with the poetry of [[Mikhail Lermontov]] and [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], dramas of [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] and [[Anton Chekhov]], and the prose of [[Nikolai Gogol]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]]. [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] have been described by literary critics as the greatest novelists of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513793/Russian-literature|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|accessdate=11 April 2008|title=Russian literature; Leo Tolstoy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|work=Time Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943893,00.html|accessdate=10 April 2008|title=Freaking-Out with Fyodor|author=Otto Friedrich|date=6 September 1971}}</ref>

By the 1880s, the age of the great novelists was over, and short fiction and poetry became the dominant genres. The next several decades became known as the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]], when the previously dominant [[literary realism]] was replaced by [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]]. Leading authors of this era include such poets as [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (poet)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Alexander Blok]], [[Nikolay Gumilev]] and [[Anna Akhmatova]], and novelists [[Leonid Andreyev]], [[Ivan Bunin]], and [[Maxim Gorky]].

[[Russian philosophy]] blossomed in the 19th century, when it was defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing Russia as a unique civilization. The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas. Notable philosophers of the late 19th and the early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], and [[Vladimir Vernadsky]].

Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 many prominent writers and philosophers left the country, including Bunin, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] and [[Nikolay Berdyayev]], while a new generation of talented authors joined together in an effort to create a distinctive [[working-class culture]] appropriate for the new Soviet state. In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]]. In the late 1950s restrictions on literature were eased, and by the 1970s and 1980s, writers were increasingly ignoring official guidelines. Leading authors of the Soviet era include novelists [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], [[Ilf and Petrov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] and [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], and poets [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], and [[Andrey Voznesensky]].

The Soviet Union was also a major producer of science fiction, written by authors like [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], [[Kir Bulychov]], [[Alexander Belayev]] and [[Ivan Yefremov]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=McGuire, Patrick L.|title=Red stars: political aspects of Soviet science fiction.

[[File:Medvedev - Russia Today 3.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] studio of [[Russia Today TV]]]]
Russian and later [[Soviet cinema]] was a hotbed of invention in the period immediately following the 1917, resulting in world-renowned films such as ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' by [[Sergei Eisenstein]].<ref name=film>{{cite web|title=Russia:Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> Eisenstein was a student of filmmaker and theorist [[Lev Kuleshov]], who developed the [[Soviet montage theory]] of film editing at the world's first film school, the [[All-Union Institute of Cinematography]]. [[Dziga Vertov]], whose ''kino-glaz'' ("film-eye") theory<U+2014>that the camera, like the human eye, is best used to explore real life<U+2014>had a huge impact on the development of documentary film making and cinema realism. The subsequent state policy of socialist realism somewhat limited creativity, however many Soviet films in this style were artistically successful, like ''[[Chapaev (film)|Chapaev]]'', ''[[The Cranes Are Flying]]'', and ''[[Ballad of a Soldier]]''.<ref name=film/>

1960s and 1970s saw a greater variety of artistic styles in the Soviet cinema. [[Eldar Ryazanov]]'s and [[Leonid Gaidai]]'s comedies of that time were immensely popular, with many of the catch phrases still in use today. In 1961<U+2013>68 [[Sergey Bondarchuk]] directed an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning [[War and Peace (film series)|film adaptation]] of Leo Tolstoy's epic ''[[War and Peace]]'', which was [[the most expensive film]] made in the Soviet Union.<ref>Birgit Beumers.

[[Russian animation]] dates back to the late [[Russian Empire]] times. During Soviet era, [[Soyuzmultfilm]] studio was the largest animation producer. Soviet animators developed a great variety of pioneering techniques and aesthetic styles, with prominent directors including [[Ivan Ivanov-Vano]], [[Fyodor Khitruk]] and [[Aleksandr Tatarsky]]. Many Soviet cartoon heroes, such as the Russian-style [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], cute little [[Cheburashka]], Wolf and Hare from ''[[Nu, Pogodi!]]'' are iconic images in Russia and many surrounding countries.

The late 1980s and 1990s were a period of crisis in Russian cinema and animation. Although Russian filmmakers became free to express themselves, state subsidies were drastically reduced, resulting in fewer films produced. The early years of the 21st century have brought increased viewership and subsequent prosperity to the industry on the back of the economic revival. Production levels are already higher than in Britain and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dzieciolowski, Z|title=Kinoeye: Russia's reviving film industry|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/globalization-Film/russian_film_3726.jsp|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> Russia's total box-office revenue in 2007 was $565&nbsp;million, up 37% from the previous year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Entertainment & Media Industry worth $27.9 bn by 2011|publisher=joomag magazine|url=http://magazine.joomag.com/Russia/4228/p44|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> In 2002 the ''[[Russian Ark]]'' became the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take.

Along with ice hockey and basketball, association football is one of the most popular sports in modern Russia. The Soviet national team became the first ever European Champions by winning [[Euro 1960]]. In recent years, Russian football, which downgraded in 1990s, has experienced a revival. Russian clubs [[PFC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] and [[Zenit St Petersburg]] won the [[UEFA Cup]] in 2005 and 2008 respectively. The [[Russian national football team]] reached the semi-finals of [[Euro 2008]], losing only to the eventual champions Spain. Russia will host the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], with 14 host cities located in the European part of the country and on the Urals. In 2007, the [[Russian national basketball team]] also won the [[EuroBasket 2007|European Basketball Championship]]. Russian basketball club [[PBC CSKA Moscow]] is one of the top teams in Europe, winning the [[Euroleague]] in [[2005<U+2013>06 Euroleague|2006]] and [[2007<U+2013>08 Euroleague|2008]].

[[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on 7 January, because [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]] and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Another two major Christian holidays are Easter and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian Muslims.

Further Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (1 May); [[Victory Day (9 May)]]; [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.

[[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia; it commemorates the victory over [[Nazism]] in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades took place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.

Popular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (New Year according to Julian Calendar on 14 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (a pre-Christian spring holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (in tribute to the first human trip into space), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pre-Christian holiday on 7 July) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (taking place on 8 July and being the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, which focuses, however, on the family love and fidelity).

State symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. The [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and has been widely used since the time of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.

The [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are main Russia's architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of the [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]], while [[birch]] the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and a [[national personification]] of Russia, though this image has a Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it only fairly recently. The native Russian national personification is [[Mother Russia]].

Tourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet times, first domestic tourism and then international tourism, fueled by the rich cultural heritage and great natural variety of the country. Major tourist routes in Russia include a journey around the [[Golden Ring]] of ancient cities, cruises on the big rivers like the [[Volga]], and long journeys on the famous [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].

The most visited destinations in Russia are Moscow and Saint Petersburg, the current and the former capitals of the country. Recognized as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renown museums as [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]] and [[Nevsky Prospect]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of Moscow ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays the [[Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, channels [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|and bridges]].

[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].

Typical Russian souvenirs include [[matryoshka doll]] and other [[handicraft]]s, [[samovar]]s for water heating, [[ushanka]] and [[papaha]] warm hats, and fur clothes. Russian [[vodka]] and [[caviar]] are among the food that attracts foreigners.

The warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts, including [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, oldest and deepest in the world,<ref name=baikal/> has crystal-clean waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains. Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its volcanoes and geysers, [[Karelia]] with its lakes and [[granite]] rocks, the snowy [[Altai Mountains]], and the wild steppes of [[Tyva]].
