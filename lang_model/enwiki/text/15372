'''St Mary's Church, Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd''' is a small medieval [[parish church]] near the village of [[Dwyran]], in [[Anglesey]], north Wales. The building probably dates from the 15th century, with some alterations.  It contains a 12th-century carved stone font and a 13th-century decorated coffin lid. The bell is inscribed with the year of its casting, 1582. The historian [[Henry Rowlands]] was vicar of St Mary's in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.  [[Maurice Wilks]], who invented the [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover]], is buried in the churchyard.

Although at one time during the 19th century St Mary's was too dilapidated to permit services to be held, repairs were carried out in the 19th century.  The church is used for worship by the [[Church in Wales]], one of five in a combined parish. Services are held once per month between April and September. St Mary's is a [[listed building|Grade II* listed building]], a national designation given to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/docs/cadw/publications/What_Is_Listing_EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> in particular because it is regarded as "a good example of a simple, substantially unaltered, late Medieval church".<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5513|title=Church of St Mary, Llanfair-yn-Cwmwd|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|year=2009|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> It is also said to be "an important survival" because many of the older churches in Anglesey were extensively rebuilt or repaired during the 19th century, and the alterations at St Mary's were less extensive.<ref name=List/>

==History and location==
St Mary's Church is located in a churchyard about {{convert|100|yd|-1}} from the road in the countryside near the village of [[Dwyran]], in [[Anglesey]], north Wales. The church is about {{convert|5.5|mi|0}} from the county town of [[Llangefni]], and just under 1&nbsp;mile (1.5&nbsp;km) from the neighbouring church of [[St Ceinwen's Church, Llangeinwen|St Ceinwen's, Llangeinwen]].<ref name=Anglesey/><ref name=RC>{{cite book|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Anglesey|origyear=1937|year=1968|author=[[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]]|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|page=74|chapter=Llanfair-y-cwmwd}}</ref> Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd takes its name in part from the church: the Welsh word {{lang|cy|[[llan (placename element)|''llan'']]}} originally meant "enclosure" and then "church", and "&#8209;fair" is a [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|modified form]] of the patron saint's name (''Mair'' being the Welsh for "Mary", here referring to [[St Mary]], the mother of Jesus).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/themes/pages/religion.shtml|title=Religion and creed in place names|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> ''Cwmwd'' means "[[commote]]" (a type of Welsh land division), so the full name of the parish means "St Mary's Church in the commote".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/placenametool/?q=llanfair+yn+y+cwmwd&search.x=0&search.y=0|accessdate=8 November 2011|title=What's in a name?|publisher=BBC Wales}}</ref>

The date of construction of the church is uncertain, but it is a [[medieval architecture|medieval building]], probably from the 15th century.<ref name=List/> The 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian [[Harry Longueville Jones]] thought that the church was probably 16th-century in date, but might have been built using material from an older structure.<ref name=Jones/> The historian Antony Carr has suggested that Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd was the church dedicated to St Mary that was sacked by Normans in 1157.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval Anglesey|page=267|last=Carr|first=Antony|publisher=Anglesey Antiquarian Society|year=1982}}</ref> St Mary's was formerly one of the [[chapel of ease|chapels of ease]] to [[Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan|St Nidan's, Llanidan]], along with [[St Deiniol's Church, Llanddaniel Fab|St Deiniol's, Llanddaniel Fab]] and [[St Edwen's Church, Llanedwen|St Edwen's, Llanedwen]].  St Nidan's and its chapels were owned by the [[Augustinian]] priory at [[Beddgelert]], Gwynedd; the date of transfer is uncertain, since not all the records have survived, but St Nidan's is mentioned as belonging to the priory in a charter of 1360.  Carr has written that "we shall never know" how the "distant community" in Beddgelert came to possess the four Anglesey churches, but thought that it might be significant that the priory also controlled two churches on the mainland, on the other side of the Menai Strait.<ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval Anglesey|pages=273<U+2013>274|last=Carr|first=Antony|publisher=Anglesey Antiquarian Society|year=1982}}</ref><ref name=Nidan>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5538|title=St Nidan's Church (Old Church)|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|year=2009|accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref>

During the 16th century, the windows of the [[nave]] had [[mullion]]s (stonework supporting the window structure) added, and the roof trusses date from later in the same century (or early in the following century).<ref name=List/>  In her 1833 history of Anglesey, the antiquarian [[Angharad Llwyd]] said that the church had been "for years in a state of such dilapidation as to preclude the performance of divine service", but she noted that it was being rebuilt at that time.<ref name=Llwyd>{{cite book|last=Llwyd|first=Angharad|authorlink=Angharad Llwyd |page=259|title=A History of the Island of Mona|year=1833|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DMY_AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=R.

Repairs were undertaken in 1936 under the supervision of the architects Harold Hughes and William G.&nbsp;Williams.<ref name=List/><ref name=Anglesey/>

St Mary's is still used for worship by the [[Church in Wales]]. A service of Holy Communion (in Welsh) is held on one Sunday afternoon per month between April and September; no services are held during the rest of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/parishholding/bangor/b027-en/churches-en/st-mary_-en/church_view|title=St Mary|publisher=Church in Wales|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> It is one of five churches in the combined [[benefice]] (parishes combined under one priest) of Newborough with Llanidan with Llangeinwen and Llanfair-yn-y-Cymwd.<ref name=CinW/>  St Mary's is within the [[deanery]] of Tindaethwy and Menai, the [[archdeaconry]] of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and the [[Diocese of Bangor]].<ref name=Parish>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/bangor/diocese/parish_details/tindaethwy_menai/stmaryllanfairynycwmwd.html|title=Deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai: St Mary, Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd|publisher=Church in Wales|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>  As of November 2011, the [[priest in charge]] of the group of parishes is E.&nbsp;Roberts.<ref name=CinW>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/rb/ben.php?dosommat=detail&which=741 |title=Church in Wales: Benefices |accessdate=8 November 2011|publisher=[[Church in Wales]]}}</ref>

People associated with the church include [[Henry Rowlands]], a clergyman and antiquarian. He was the incumbent priest of St Nidan's and its chapels of ease from 1696 until his death in 1723, and wrote a history of Anglesey, ''Mona Antiqua Restaurata''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-ROWL-HEN-1655.html|title=Rowlands, Henry|work=[[Welsh Biography Online]]|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|year=2009|last=Wright|first=Evan Gilbert|accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> [[Maurice Wilks]], who invented the [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover]], is buried in the churchyard.<ref name=Anglesey/> He had a farm nearby in [[Newborough, Anglesey|Newborough]] and some prototype testing of the Land Rover was carried out in Anglesey.<ref name=Anglesey/><ref>{{cite web|first=Anne |last=Pimlott Baker|title=Wilks, Maurice Cary Ferdinand (1904<U+2013>1963)|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year= 2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/70295|format={{ODNBsub}}|accessdate= 8 November 2011}}</ref>

==Architecture and fittings==
The church is built from [[rubble masonry]], dressed with sandstone, and measures {{convert|47|by|14|ft|1}}.<ref name=List/><ref name=Jones/>  The entrance is at the west end of the north wall. The roof, which is made from slate, has a [[bellcote]] with one bell at the west end. The inscription on the bell states that it was cast in 1582, and the bell is also marked with a fleur-de-lys and the thrice-repeated initials "AMN".<ref name=List/>

Inside, although there is no structural division between the [[nave]] and the [[chancel]], there is a 19th-century wooden screen with wrought-iron gates between them, and a step up into the chancel.  The sanctuary is marked with a further step, as is the base of the altar; both steps are decorated with [[encaustic tile]]s. The internal woodwork of the roof, which has seven bays (or sections), is exposed.<ref name=List/>

The window in the centre north wall has two lights (sections of window separated by a mullion); there are two pairs of two-light windows in the south wall. The window at the east end had a pair of lights, topped by [[trefoil]]s (a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles).<ref name=List/>

The roughly oval gritsone font at the west end of the nave, which is from the 12th century, has a zig-zag pattern, and three sides decorated with a cross. The base of the font, which is rectangular with rounded corners, has misshapen carved human heads at the corners and in the middle of one side, and a snake on two of the sides.<ref name=List/><ref name=Jones/> A "P"-shaped sign on the east side of the font may have been added later.<ref name=RC/>  St Mary's has a coffin lid dating from the middle of the 13th century, displayed upside down on the north wall of the chancel.<ref name=List/><ref name=RC/> It is decorated with a carved cross and a foliage design.<ref name=List/> One 19th-century visitor noted another three old plain coffin lids on the church floor, with another in the churchyard near the east window.<ref name=Jones/> As well as an 18th-century slate plaque on the south wall of the nave, there are also various memorials from the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref name=List/>

==Assessment==

The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II* [[listed building]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating "particularly important buildings of more than special interest".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 30 January 1968, and has been listed because it is regarded as "a good example of a simple, substantially unaltered, late Medieval church."<ref name=List/> [[Cadw]] (the [[Welsh Government]] body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that many old churches in Anglesey were rebuilt or restored during the 19th century, and that St Mary's "can be considered an important survival."<ref name=List/>

Writing in 1846, Harry Longueville Jones said that St Mary's was "one of the smallest buildings of its class in the island" and had "no feature of any architectural value."<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal|first=Harry|last=Longueville Jones|authorlink=Harry Longueville Jones|year=1846|journal=[[Archaeologia Cambrensis]]|volume=I|publisher=[[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]|pages=435<U+2013>436|title=Mona Mediaeva No. IV|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam03powegoog#page/n560/mode/1up}}</ref> He noted the "elaborate" coffin lid, and said that the font (a "rude production of the twelfth century") was "one of the most remarkable in the collection of Anglesey monuments".<ref name=Jones/>  The historian and clergyman [[Edmund Tyrrell Green]], writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, referred to the coffin lid as one of the county's "outstanding examples" of sepulchral memorials.<ref name=Green>{{cite journal|journal=[[Y Cymmrodor]]|publisher=[[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]]|year=1929|volume=XL|title=The Ecclesiology of Anglesey|last=Tyrrell Green|first=E.|authorlink=Edmund Tyrrell Green|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/ycymmrodor40cymmuoft#page/106/mode/1up|pages=106<U+2013>107}}</ref>

A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes St Mary's as "a good example of a small unspoilt country church."<ref name=Anglesey>{{cite book|title=Anglesey Churches|pages=90<U+2013>91|isbn=1845270894|publisher=[[Gwasg Carreg Gwalch]]|last=Jones|first=Geraint I.
