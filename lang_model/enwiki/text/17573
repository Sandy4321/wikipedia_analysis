'''Luc Bourdon''' (February 16, 1987 <U+2013> May 29, 2008) was a Canadian professional [[ice hockey]] [[Defenceman (ice hockey)|defenceman]] who played for the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and their [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]], from 2006 until 2008. After overcoming [[childhood arthritis]], he was selected third overall in the 2003 [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] (QMJHL) draft and played for the [[Val-d'Or Foreurs]], [[Moncton Wildcats]], and [[Cape Breton Screaming Eagles]], spending four seasons in the QMJHL. The Canucks drafted Bourdon with their first selection, tenth overall, in the [[2005 NHL Entry Draft]]. Noted as a strong defenceman who could contribute on offence, Bourdon represented [[Canada national junior hockey team|Canada]] in three international tournaments, winning two gold medals at the [[IIHF World U20 Championship]] and a silver medal at the [[IIHF World U18 Championship]]. Bourdon died at the age of 21 near his hometown of [[Shippagan, New Brunswick|Shippagan]], [[New Brunswick]], when his motorcycle collided with a tractor trailer.

Initially failing to make the Canucks starting roster out of training camp, Bourdon began the [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season|2007<U+2013>08 season]] with the Manitoba Moose; however, because of a series of injuries among the Canucks' defencemen throughout the season, Bourdon was called up on several occasions. Bourdon scored his first goal on November 16, 2007, against goaltender [[Niklas B<U+00E4>ckstr<U+00F6>m]] in a 6<U+2013>2 win over the Minnesota Wild.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Canucks break out|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071117.wspt-nhl-canucks-wild-16/GSStory/GlobeSports|work=Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|author=Canadian Press|accessdate=2008-07-19|date=2007-11-17}}</ref>  Bourdon finished the season on the Canucks roster, and was sent back to the Manitoba Moose for the AHL playoffs, playing in six playoff games for the Moose.
