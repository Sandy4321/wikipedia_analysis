Holden returned to the United States to play in [[Major League Soccer]] with [[Houston Dynamo]] for the 2006 season. He made his MLS debut on May 27, 2006, and scored his first professional goal on July 22, 2006, in a 1<U+2013>1 home draw against [[New England Revolution|New England]]. He appeared thirteen times in the 2006 regular season and twice as a substitute in Houston's run to the [[MLS Cup 2006]] championship.

In the [[2010-11 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2010-11]] season, Holden was a virtual ever present, helping Bolton reach seventh place in the Premier League and an [[FA Cup Semi-Final]]. However, his season was cut short on 19 March after he suffered a knee injury against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]] when going into a tackle with [[Jonny Evans]]. Evans' studs caught Holden in the right knee, leaving a gash that required twenty six stitches<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/8921048.Wanderers__anxious_wait_for_Holden/ | work=Bolton News | title=Wanderers' anxious wait for Holden | date=March 21, 2011}}</ref> and an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]], which ruled him out for up to six months.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bolton_wanderers/9431341.stm| work=BBC Sport | title=Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden out for six months | date=March 21, 2011}}</ref> Despite missing the final two months of the season, Holden was still voted the 2011 Bolton Wanderers Player of the Year.

==International career==

==Style of play==
Holden is a versatile, linking midfielder who, due to his ambidexterity, can play in the left, right, or center of the midfield.{{cn}} Holden is particularly noted for his adeptness at taking [[Set piece (football)|set pieces]] and delivering crosses, being compared favorably to [[David Beckham]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Iles |first=Marc |title=Wanderers 1 Wolves 0 |url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/5033219.Wanderers_1_Wolves_0/ |publisher=''[[The Bolton News]]'' |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Holden was born in [[Scotland]], and moved to the United States at the age of ten. Holden's father lost a six-year battle with cancer in early 2009. His mother and sister still live in Houston.<ref>http://goal.com/en-us/news/1679/us-national-team/2009/09/23/1519545/holden-playing-for-the-us-a-no-brainer</ref> He has been an American [[citizenship|citizen]] since 2006.<ref name="longman">{{Cite news |first=Jer<U+00E9> |last=Longman |title=Understudy Is Hitting His Marks for U.S. Team |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/sports/soccer/26holden.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=SP8 |date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref> Every game, Holden wears a [[Livestrong bracelet]] that belonged to his father, taping over it for its protection.<ref>http://www.stuholden.com/q-a/</ref>

Holden's brother, [[Euan Holden]], is also a professional soccer player who is currently with [[Danish 1st Division]] club [[FC Hj<U+00F8>rring]].

===Professional gaming career===
Before his professional sports career Holden played competitive [[Counter-Strike]] under the alias Holden, most famously playing for Forsaken in the United States. During his time with the team he helped them to a second place at the [[World Cyber Games|WCG 2002 qualifier]] and 8th place at [[Cyberathlete Professional League|CPL Summer 2003]]. His CS career took a back seat as he began to play soccer seriously for [[Clemson University]] eventually leading into his [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] career.<ref>[http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/29602-ExCS_player_makes_US_World_Cup_team Ex-CS star Holden makes US World Cup team]</ref><ref>[http://www.mymym.com/en/news/18646.html Former Counter-strike player Stuart Holden]</ref>

Holden has admitted that he is slightly embarrassed by his gaming career, stating, "When I first started playing football professionally it all started to come out and I was a bit ashamed of it. I tried to hide it but eventually I've just started to embrace it. There's nothing I can do. I've deleted it off my Wikipedia page about four or five times and someone just keeps putting it back up there!"<ref>[http://www.socceram.com/story/0,21644,13873_6847631,00.html Counter-Strike-s again]</ref>
