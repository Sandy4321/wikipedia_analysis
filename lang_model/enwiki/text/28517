'''Loring Air Force Base''' is a former [[United States Air Force]] base that was under the operational control of the [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) for most of its existence.  In 1992, it was transferred to the newly-established [[Air Combat Command]], and it was finally closed as an active Air Force installation in 1994.  Loring is located in the town of [[Limestone, Maine|Limestone]], [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], Maine. It is treated for statistical purposes by the [[United States Census Bureau]] as a [[census-designated place]]. At the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], the base had a total population of 225. It was named for Major [[Charles J. Loring, Jr.]], [[USAF]], a [[Medal of Honor]] recipient during the [[Korean War]]. From 1951-1962, it was co-located next to [[Caribou Air Force Station]].

==History==
===Beginnings===
Loring AFB was carved out of the woods of Maine beginning in the late forties and officially dedicated in 1953. It was named after [[Charles J. Loring, Jr.]], who was killed in the [[Korean War]]. Along with the nearby [[Presque Isle Air Force Base]], some of its roads were named after states in the Union. It was the closest Air Force base on the east coast to Europe. It was originally built with a capacity of 100 [[B-36 Peacemaker]] bombers and equipped with a {{convert|10000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway. Fuel was delivered to the base via a 200 mile pipeline, which started to the south in [[Searsport, Maine]].

===42nd Bomb Wing===
The host wing for Loring AFB throughout its existence was the [[42nd Air Base Wing|42nd Bomb Wing]]. The wing originally flew the [[B-36 Peacemaker]], converting later to the [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. The wing also flew the [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]. When the wing transitioned to B-52s, the overruns were added to the base.

To provide air defense of the base, United States Army [[Nike Hercules|Nike-Hercules]] Surface-to-air missile sites were constructed during 1956.  Sites were located near Caribou (L-58) 
{{Coord|46|53|02|N|068|00|32|W}}; Caswell (L-13) {{Coord|47|01|42|N|067|48|35|W}}; Connor Twp. (L-85) {{Coord|47|00|29|N|068|01|06|W}}, and Limestone (L-31) {{Coord|46|55|04|N|067|47|32|W}} Maine.  

The New England Division of the Army Corps of Engineers managed the construction of these sites. Manned by Regular Army units, these sites provided defense for Loring AFB and the northeastern approaches to the United States. In 1960, sites L-13 and L-58 underwent conversion from Ajax to Hercules missiles. These sites remained operational until 1966, although the site at Limestone was closed in September 1958.

===Weapons storage area===
The Nuclear Weapons Storage Area at Loring once operated as a separate, top secret facility.  Originally called the [[North River Depot]], the remote area to the northeast of Loring<U+2019>s property was the first U.S. Operational site specifically constructed for the storage, assembly, and testing of atomic weapons.<ref name="Historic American Engineering Record-Loring WSA">[[Historic American Engineering Record]]. ''Loring Air Force Base, Weapons Storage Area, Northeastern corner of base at northern end of Maine Road, Limestone vicinity, Aroostook County, ME''. On file with [[The Library of Congress]].</ref>

A parallel series of four fences, one of which was electrified, surrounded the heart of the storage area.  This area was nicknamed the <U+201C>Q<U+201D> Area, which denoted the Department of Energy<U+2019>s [Q clearance] a classified security clearance required to have access to Restricted Data.

In June 1962, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] released its custody and ownership of the weapons to the Air Force.  The personnel and property of the later named [[Caribou Air Force Station]], were absorbed into the adjacent Loring Air Force Base.

===Closure===
Loring AFB was first targeted for closure in 1976. The Air Force's primary rationale at that time was the poor condition of Loring AFB's facilities. In 1976, it was estimated that Loring AFB needed up to $300 million in facilities improvements. Between 1976 and 1979, considerable debate took place over the strategic importance of Loring AFB, resulting in a reversal of the Air Force decision to close the base. When the decision to keep Loring AFB open was made in 1979, Congress committed itself to upgrading the base facilities. Since 1981, nearly $300 million in military construction and operations and maintenance funds were spent to upgrade the facilities.

In 1991, the Secretary of Defense, upon the recommendation of the Secretary of the Air Force, identified six Strategic Air Command bases for closure. Loring Air Force Base was one of the six bases on the closure list.

The official base closure date was 30 September 1994.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the base CDP has a total area of 8.2&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (21.3&nbsp;km<U+00B2>). 8.2&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (21.3&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it is land and 0.04&nbsp;mi<U+00B2> (0.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of it (0.36%) is water.

The {{Convert|9472|acre|km2|sing=on}} base property is now administered by the [http://www.loring.org Loring Development Authority] of Maine.  The base is now called the '''Loring Commerce Center''' and is marketed as an "aviation and industrial complex and business park".

Military users to the old base include:
* DFAS Limestone, a major component of the [[Defense Finance and Accounting Service]] office (BRAC 2005 consolidated 26 offices into 5 and this was one of the consolidation points
* [[Maine Military Authority]], refurbishes [[Humvee]]s for the US Army and US Marine Corps

Civilian users of the facility include:
* Loring Job Corps Center
* U.S. Fish & Wildlife National Wildlife Refuge (administering {{convert|4700|acre|km2}} of the base property)
* various call centers, food processing and forestry operations, light manufacturing, and aviation services
* The home of an office belonging to [[Stantec]]

The airfield at Loring Commerce Center was used by the popular jam-band [[Phish]], to hold its massive festival concerts, "[[The Great Went]]" in 1997, the [[Lemonwheel]] in 1998 and "[[It (Phish festival)|It]]" in 2003.  Estimated attendance was 65,000 concert-goers and Phish was the only band.  Fans camped on-site in tents, creating a community of fans that became the second largest city in Maine during all three events.
