The '''1648 free election''' in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] began on October 6, 1648, and ended on November 17 of the same year. New King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania was [[Jan Kazimierz Waza]], younger brother of previous King, [[Wladyslaw IV Waza]], who died on May 20, 1648.

== Background ==
Death of King Wladyslaw IV Waza, which took place in the town of [[Merkine]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], was not a surprise, as the King, despite being only 52 years of age, suffered from [[gout]] and kidney failure. Wladyslaw died at the beginning of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], which devastated southeastern part of the enormous country. Following a customary rule, Poland-Lithuania was ruled by an [[interrex]], senile Primate [[Maciej Lubienski]]. Due to Lubienski<U+2019>s health problems, powerful Crown Chancellor [[Jerzy Ossolinski]] became de facto an interrex.

The 1648 free election was to a large degree influenced by the ongoing conflict in the Ukrainian provinces of Poland. The two opposing factions that emerged during the election were:
* pro-peace camp, headed by Jerzy Ossolinski and [[Starosta]] of [[Kiev]] [[Adam Kisiel]]. It supported election of [[John II Casimir Vasa|Jan Kazimierz]],
* pro-war camp, headed by [[Jeremi Wisniowiecki]] and [[Aleksander Koniecpolski]]. This camp backed Jan Kazimierz<U+2019>s brother, Prince-Bishop of [[Breslau]], [[Karol Ferdynand Vasa]].

Apart from two [[House of Vasa]] candidates, Protestant [[szlachta|nobility]] supported [[Sigismund Rakoczi]], son of Duke of [[Transilvania]], [[George I Rakoczi]]. Sigismund was also backed by Orthodox Christians, and by [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]].

== Convocation Sejm ==
The so-called Convocation Sejm convened in Warsaw on July 16, 1648, and deliberated until August 1. The two camps argued with each other, as the pro-war faction blamed late King Wladyslaw Waza and Jerzy Ossolinski for the outbreak of the uprising in Polish Ukraine. Upon request of Ossolinski, the Sejm became a [[Confederation (Poland)|confederation]], in order to begin negotiations with Khmelnytsky, and to break down the [[Zaporizhian Cossack]] - [[Crimean Tatar]] alliance.

== Election ==
The election, which began on October 6, 1648, took place in the shadow of a disastrous Polish defeat in the [[Battle of Pilawce]], in which Polish forces were commanded by  [[Wladyslaw Dominik Zaslawski]], [[Mikolaj Ostrorog,]] and [[Aleksander Koniecpolski]]. All three supported Prince-Bishop of Breslau Karol Ferdynand Vasa, but despite this, the outcome of the election was uncertain.

Since both candidates enjoyed widespread support among the electors, there was danger that a double election would take place, similar to the one in [[Free election, 1587|1587]]. The situation did not change after Queen [[Marie Louise Gonzaga]] expressed her support of Jan Kazimierz. Furthermore, Jan Kazimierz was backed by the [[Kingdom of France]], [[Swedish Empire]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia]].

The stalemate ended when Sigismund Rakoczi backed out of the election, after the death of his father (October 11). [[Hetman]] [[Janusz Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142> (1612<U+2013>55)|Janusz Radziwill]], who had supported Rakoczi, decided then to back Jan Kazimierz. Also, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, himself a Polish subject, who at the same time commanded the siege of [[Zamosc Fortress]], sent a letter to Warsaw, expressing his support of Jan Kazimierz. Khmelnytsky<U+2019>s letter was welcomed by the electors, who hoped for a truce with the Cossacks.

Since Karol Ferdynand Vasa was well aware of the fact that his election would mean war, and the situation of the Commonwealth was difficult, he decided to withdraw his nomination (November 11, 1648). In exchange, he received the [[Duchy of Opole and Raciborz]] and two abbeys.

On November 17, Jan Kazimierz was elected new King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. Three days later, he signed the [[pacta conventa]], and Primate Lubienski confirmed the nomination. The coronation took place in Krakow<U+2019>s [[Wawel Cathedral]], on January 17, 1649.
