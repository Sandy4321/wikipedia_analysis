'''''Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution''''' is a [[1973]] [[essay]] by the [[evolutionary biologist]] and [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Christian]] [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], criticising [[Young Earth creationism]] and espousing [[Theistic evolution|evolutionary creationism]].  The essay was first published in the ''[[American Biology Teacher]]'', volume 35 125-129.  

Dobzhansky first published the title statement in a 1964 article in ''American Zoologist'', "Biology, Molecular and Organismic", to assert the importance of organismic biology in response to the challenge of the rising field of [[molecular biology]].<ref>Theodosius Dobzhansky, ""Biology, Molecular and Organismic", ''American Zoologist'', volume 4 (1964), pp 443-452.  The phrase appears in the first page.</ref>

== Overview ==
Dobzhansky starts with a [[reductio ad absurdum]] of the [[geocentrism]] of an Arab sheik (who may have been [[Ibn Baz|Shaikh Abdulaziz bin Baz]], later the [[Grand Mufti]] of [[Saudi Arabia]]) who believes the [[Sun]] revolves around the [[Earth]] because [[Sacred text|scripture]] says so. Dobzhansky asserts his own belief that scripture and [[science]] do not contradict each other.  He criticises creationists for implying that [[God]] is deceitful and asserts that this is [[blasphemous]].

Dobzhansky then goes on to describe the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life]] on [[Earth]], and that the diversity of species cannot be best explained by [[Creation (theology)|creationism]] because of the [[Ecology|ecological]] interactions between them. He uses examples of evidence for evolution: the genetic sequence of [[cytochrome C]] to show evidence for [[common descent]]; embryology; and his own work on [[Drosophila|fruit flies]] in [[Hawaii]]. Dobzhansky concludes that scripture and science are two different things: "It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology".

== The central issue ==

The central issue of the essay is the role of [[creation and evolution in public education]] in the United States.  The essay is aimed at the intelligent lay reader who has religious feelings, and is unsure of the validity of [[biological evolution]].

== The phrase ==
The notion of the "[[light]] of evolution" came originally from the [[Jesuit]] priest [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], whom Dobzhansky much admired:
:''(Evolution) is a general postulate to which all theories, all hypotheses, all systems must hence forward bow and which they must satisfy in order to be thinkable and true. Evolution is a light which illuminates all facts, a trajectory which all lines of thought must follow &mdash; this is what evolution is.''

The phrase "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution" is often used by those opposing [[creationism]].  

It argues that Christianity and [[evolutionary biology]] are compatible.  Despite this, many use the phrase in a way which the original was not intended.
Many would argue that "in biology" includes [[anthropology]], and just three years later [[Richard Dawkins]] published ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' arguing for [[universal Darwinism]].

== Quotations ==
{{quotation|I am a creationist and an evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's method of creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago and is still under way.|Theodosius Dobzhansky| "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution" (1973)}}

{{quotation|Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary, insoluble conflicts. ...the blunder leads to blasphemy: the Creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness.|Theodosius Dobzhansky| "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution" (1973)}}
