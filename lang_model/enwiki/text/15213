[[Image:AdrianPeterson.jpg|thumb|right|Adrian Peterson, the Vikings' seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft.]]
This is a '''list of first-round draft picks made by the [[Minnesota Vikings]]''' of the [[National Football League]]. The Vikings joined the NFL in [[1961 NFL season|1961]].  The Vikings' first selection as an NFL team was [[Tommy Mason]], a [[running back]] from [[Tulane University]]. The team's most recent first round selection was [[Adrian L. Peterson|Adrian Peterson]], a running back from the [[University of Oklahoma]].

Every year during April, each NFL franchise seeks to add new players to its roster through a collegiate [[draft (sports)|draft]] known as "[[NFL draft|the NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting]]", which is more commonly known as the NFL Draft.  Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous [[Super Bowl]]; the Super Bowl champion ''always'' picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser ''always'' picks 31st.  Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof.  Thus, it is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. 

The Vikings have selected number one overall twice.  The Vikings received the first pick in 1961 as an expansion franchise and then again in 1968 when the franchise chose [[Ron Yary]], an [[offensive tackle]] from the [[University of Southern California]].  The Vikings have selected players from the [[University of Southern California]] four times and from [[Michigan State University]], [[Ohio State University]], and [[Oklahoma State University]] three times.   Three eventual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] were selected by the Vikings in the first-round: [[Carl Eller]], [[Alan Page]], and Ron Yary.
