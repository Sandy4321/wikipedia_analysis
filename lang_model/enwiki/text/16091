"'''Do the Bartman'''" is a [[pop rap]] song from the 1990 ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' album ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]''. It was performed by ''The Simpsons'' cast member [[Nancy Cartwright]] and was released as a promotional [[single (music)|single]] from the album on November 20, 1990. The song was written and produced by American recording artist [[Michael Jackson]], and Bryan Loren. Although Jackson did not receive any credit because he was under contract to another record label, he was a fan of ''The Simpsons''<U+2014>especially the character [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]<U+2014>and had called the producers one night offering to write Bart a number-one single and do a guest spot on the show, which is how the song originated. 

"Do the Bartman" was never officially released as a single in the [[United States]], but placed first on the singles charts in [[Australia]], [[Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Additionally, it reached the top ten in [[Sweden]] and the [[Netherlands]], and was certified gold in the United Kingdom. A music video, which was directed by [[Brad Bird]], was released for the song in 1991. The video became a hit on the American network [[MTV]] and received a nomination at the [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards]].

The album ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]'' was released in September 1990. The first single from it was the [[pop rap]] song "Do the Bartman", performed by [[Bart Simpson]]'s voice actor [[Nancy Cartwright]] and released on November 20, 1990.<ref name="mtvnews"/> Rumors began spreading in the summer of 1990 that [[Michael Jackson]] would write a song for Bart on the album. This song was reported early on to be "Do the Bartman", but executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] issued a press release in September 1990 apologizing for the misunderstanding and stating that song was actually written by one of Jackson's friends, Bryan Loren.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XiUOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y30DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6902,325497&dq=do-the-bartman |title='Simpsons' head to recording studio |author=Deborah Hastings |work=[[St. Petersburg Times|Tampabay.com]] |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=1990-09-26 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

== Critical reception ==
Critical reviews of the song were mostly positive. Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described it as "not bad", and commented that Bart's high voice "echoes the beats nicely".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20205234,00.html |title=The Simpsons Sing the Blues |author=Ken Tucker |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Warner|Time Warner, Inc]] |date=1990-12-14 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> The Daily Vault's Benny Balneg liked that the song disengaged itself from the album's "[[blues]] tag" and incorporated more "contemporary elements" into its sound.<ref name="d.v.review"/> He added that he thought the song had a "catchy beat" and an "infectious chorus".<ref name="d.v.review">{{cite web |url=http://dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=4836 |title=The Daily Vault Music Reviews : The Simpsons Sing The Blues |work=Dailyvault.com |publisher=David Geffen Co |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> ''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]'''s Patricia Smith called "Do the Bartman" a "surprisingly funky tune".<ref>{{cite news |title=Funky Bart |author=Patricia Smith |work=Long Beach Press-Telegram |pages=D7 |date=1990-12-11 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> Monika Bartyzel of Cinematical, however, thought the song was a "cheesy number".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2007/08/10/powder-blue-adds-the-swayze/ |author=Monika Bartyzel |title='Powder Blue' Adds The Swayze |work=Cinematical.com |publisher=Weblogs, Inc.

== Chart performance ==
While the song was never officially released as a single in the United States, it was very successful in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom, countries where it peaked at number one on the singles chart. In 1991 it was the number one song in the United Kingdom for three weeks from February 16 to March 9 and was the seventh best-selling song of the year.<ref name="ukcharts1">{{cite web |url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=5 |title=All the Number 1 Singles<U+2013>1990s |work=TheOfficialCharts.com|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]] |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> "Do The Bartman" has shipped at least 400,000 units in the United Kingdom and was certified gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] on February 1, 1991.<ref name="certicatesuk">{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=18135 |title=Certified awards |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |accessdate=2010-01-25|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080525230952/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=18135 |archivedate = May 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref name="ukcert.2"/> The song's success in the United Kingdom was remarkable, given that at that time ''The Simpsons'' had not yet been shown on British terrestrial television, and was not for a further five years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/602166.stm |title=Simpsons celebrate 10 years |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC Online |date=2000-01-13 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz/s/1048193_tellys_first_family |title=Telly's first family |author=Kate Whiting |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |publisher=M.E.N.

The [[music video]] features the typical plot of Bart rebelling against authority when he decides to put his own spin on a rigidly choreographed dance presentation at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. The music video for "Do the Bartman" was directed by [[Brad Bird]], with dance choreography by [[Michael Chambers]]. Nobody from the staff of ''The Simpsons'' wanted to direct it because they were busy doing the show, but Bird finally agreed to do it after having been asked four times. He had a very short amount of time to finish the video because it was supposed to coincide with the release of ''The Simpsons Sing the Blues''.<ref name="dvd"/>

The entire music video was storyboarded in only two days in the United States. Bird then got on a plane to [[Budapest]], Hungary, where the video was animated by [[Varga Studio]]. They thought the video was going to be animated as simply as the original [[The Simpsons shorts|''The Simpsons'' shorts]], so when Bird told them that it was going to be done in full animation with no repeated scenes, they "went into deep shock".<ref name="dvd"/> The animators added the wraparound at the beginning to set Bart against the crowd and put the video in "some sort of context."<ref name="dvd"/>

The video was nominated for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects|Best Special Effects]] at the [[1991 MTV Video Music Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1991/ |title=1991 Video Music Awards |work=MTV |publisher=Viacom |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=R.E.M. leads nominations for Video Music Awards |author=Hastings, Deborah |work=[[The Deseret News]]  |date=1991-07-29 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> It was the number one music video on rotation on American [[MTV]] network between January and March 1991.<ref name="popmatters">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/article/the-evolution-of-the-simpsons |title=The evolution of 'The Simpsons' |author=Chuck Barney |work=Pop Matters |publisher=PopMatters Media, Inc |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> Following the [[death of Michael Jackson]] on June 25, 2009, the music video was broadcast by the [[Fox network]] on June 28, 2009<U+2014>ahead of a rerun of the episode "[[Wedding for Disaster]]"<U+2014>and featured a title card paying tribute to Jackson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/06/michael-jackson-the-simpsons-to-air-do-the-bartman-video-in-tribute.html |title=Michael Jackson: 'The Simpsons' to re-air 'Do the Bartman' video in tribute on Sunday |author=Dan Snierson  |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Warner Inc |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>
