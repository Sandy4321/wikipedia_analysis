A number of '''controversies and concerns associated with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] have emerged which have been the subject of public debate and media commentary.

{{2012 Summer Olympics}}

==Prior to the games==
===IOC policy===
====Brand protection====
The protection of the Olympic [[brand]] has been the subject of some criticism. The [[Olympic symbols|Olympic rings]] themselves are protected in the United Kingdom under the [[Criminal Appeal Act of 1995|Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act 1995]], and under provisions set out by the [[London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006]], the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games]] (LOCOG) are empowered to prevent the misuse of Olympic branding leading up to the 2012 Games. The acts aim to prevent unauthorised commercial association with the games by traders (such as using the Olympic rings in a shop window) and to prevent attempts at [[ambush marketing]] at games events, but the constraints detailed in the guidelines issued by LOCOG have been criticised by some commentators as a form of [[censorship]].<ref name=independent-180712>{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Steve |title=The Debate: Have Olympic sponsorship regulations gone too far? |url= http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/07/18/the-debate-have-olympic-sponsorship-regulations-gone-too-far/ |accessdate=21 July 2012|date=18 July 2012 |work=The Debate (blog)(The Independent) |location =London}}</ref><ref name=atalantic-130712>{{cite news |last=O'Sullivan |first=Feargus |title=The Pettiness of Olympic Branding |url= http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/06/pettiness-olympic-branding/2256/ |accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=The Atlantic Cities |location =Washington DC |date=13 June 2012}}</ref>

The guidelines specify a range of [[trademark]]ed logos and designs as well as certain "Listed Expressions" and protected words that advertisers may not use, which include the words "London" and "2012". Even if an advertiser does not mention the Olympics or use any of the listed words, any visual or audio representation of London and sports may be considered by a court to be an infringement of LOCOG's rights and subject to a fine of <U+00A3>20,000 or possible imprisonment.<ref name=locog-brand>{{cite web |title=The Protected Games' Marks |url= http://www.london2012.com/documents/brand-guidelines/guide-to-protected-games-marks.pdf |work=Brand guidelines |publisher=LOCOG|accessdate=21 July 2012}}</ref> A number of individuals and businesses have fallen foul of the restrictions including a lingerie shop in Leicester,<ref name=Leicester-Mercury>{{cite news |title=Melton lingerie shop told to remove 'Olympic rings' display |url= http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Melton-lingerie-shop-told-remove-Olympic-rings/story-15932434-detail/story.html |accessdate=21 July 2012 |newspaper=Leicester Mercury |date=27 April 2012}}</ref> a grandmother knitting for charity<ref name=dailymail-knitting>{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Martin |title=Charity knitting group fundraiser, 81, banned from selling <U+00A3>1 doll because 'GB 2012' logo breaches Olympic copyright laws |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2148081/Charity-knitting-group-fundraiser-81-banned-selling-1-doll-GB-2012-logo-breaches-Olympic-copyright-laws.html |accessdate=21 July 2012 |newspaper=Daily Mail |location =London |date=22 May 2012}}</ref> and a Plymouth caf<U+00E9> selling Olympic torch baguettes.<ref name=independent-210712>{{cite news |title=The torch relay: Golden moment or flaming nuisance? |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/the-torch-relay-golden-moment-or-flaming-nuisance-7789295.html |accessdate=21 July 2012 |newspaper=The Independent |location =London |date=26 May 2012 |first1=Tom |last1=Peck |first2=Charlie |last2=Cooper}}</ref> An exception to these rules was successfully negotiated by the restaurant chain [[Little Chef]], who have been permitted by LOCOG to continue to sell their [[full breakfast|fried]] "Olympic Breakfast" because the item has carried that name on their menu since 1994.<ref name=littlechef>{{cite news|title=Little Chef allowed to keep Olympic Breakfast, LOCOG rules Read more at http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2012/07/23/little-chef-allowed-keep-olympic-breakfast-locog-rules#DgsYhExelFkYhXUY.99|url=http://www.thedrum.co.uk/news/2012/07/23/little-chef-allowed-keep-olympic-breakfast-locog-rules|accessdate=26 July 2012|newspaper=The Drum}}</ref>

In an interview with BBC journalist [[Evan Davis]], Lord Coe emphasised the need to protect the rights of official sponsors such as [[BMW]] and [[Adidas]] who had contributed large sums of money to the Games. His suggestion that visitors to the London games would not be admitted if they were wearing a [[Pepsi]]-branded [[T-shirt]] was later retracted by LOCOG, who stated that such rules would apply only to large groups of spectators wearing "visibly branded" clothing.<ref name=bbc-pepsi>{{cite news |title=London 2012: Organisers clarify rules on branded clothing for spectators |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18922964|accessdate=21 July 2012 |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 July 2012}}</ref>

Criticism has also focused on the exclusive rights held by some sponsors to serve and advertise food at and near to Olympic venues;<ref>Eccles, Louise (3 July 2012). [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2164517/Worlds-biggest-McDonalds-First-pictures-inside-Olympic-Stadium-fast-food-restaurant.html "McDonald's, supersized: First pictures inside the world's biggest fast food restaurant...yards from Olympic stadium"]. ''Daily Mail'' (London).</ref> McDonald's hold sole rights to sell [[french fries|chips]] throughout the games, preventing independent food outlets from serving chips with any meal, although an exception was negotiated with McDonald's to allow the sale of traditional British [[fish and chips]].<ref name=guardian-food-may2012>{{cite news|last=Booth|first=Robert|title=Feeding the Olympics: menus to take Games visitors around the world|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/25/olympics-menus-round-the-world|accessdate=23 July 2012|date=25 May 2012}}</ref> Food sellers must also comply with food outlet specifications which require prominent display of Coca-Cola branding with limited space for their own products.<ref name="youandyours-23072012">{{cite interview |last = Ayre |first = Maggie |interviewer= Worricker, Julian  |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l02jc  |program = [[You and Yours]] |callsign = BBC Radio 4 |city= London  |date = 23 July 2012 |at = 29:20 |accessdate = 23 July 2012 }}</ref>

====Restrictions on social media use====
According to the rule 40 of the IOC's Social Media, Blogging and Internet Guidelines, Athletes competing in the Olympic Games are not allowed to appear advertising or quoting their personal sponsors on social networks shortly before and during the Games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Games_London_2012/IOC_Social_Media_Blogging_and_Internet_Guidelines-London.pdf |title=IOC Social Media Blogging and Internet Guidelines - London |publisher=IOC |date= |accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref> This rule is supposed to protect official Games sponsors interests.

Some US athletes led the protest against the rule 40 as they consider that this kind of rule preventing from offering publicity to their sponsors will make it difficult to secure personal sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Emma|title=Olympic Athletes Rebel Against Social-Media Rules|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/olympic-athletes-rebel-social-media-rules/236404/|newspaper=Advertising Age|date=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

====Doping suspensions====
{{relevance|date=July 2012}}
{{See also|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games}}
The IOC amended the Olympic Charter in June 2008 in order to bar athletes suspended for at least six months for a doping offence from competing at the Olympic Games following the end of the suspension. This provision, known as the Osaka Rule or Rule 45, was challenged before the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]]. In October 2011 the court found that the provision was not an eligibility rule, but a sanction not mandated by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency|World Anti-Doping Code]] and thus invalid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/d2wfiles/document/5314/5048/0/Final20award202422.pdf |title=CAS 2011/O/2422 USOC v.

The rulings have led to calls from the IOC and the BOA to include a provision similar to the Osaka Rule in the next Anti-Doping Code, which will be in effect by the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Ben|last=Knight |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-23/banned-sprinters-olympic-return-sparks-doping/4149238?section=sport |title=Banned sprinters' Olympic return sparks doping debate |publisher=ABC News |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wada-ama.org/en/World-Anti-Doping-Program/Sports-and-Anti-Doping-Organizations/The-Code/Code-Review/ |title=Code Review - World Anti-Doping Agency |publisher=Wada-ama.org |date= |accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>

===Sponsors===

====Healthy eating====
There has been criticism that companies that produce [[junk food]] or otherwise unhealthy food and drink are major sponsors of the Olympics, notably [[McDonald's]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Cadbury]] and [[Heineken]], which is in conflict with the Olympics' ideal of health and wellness.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18783272 Cardiologist: Ban junk food from sponsoring Olympics], ''BBC News'', 10 July 2012</ref><ref name=Coombes>{{cite web |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c2904.full?ijkey=oVPNbw7XknkEg&keytype=ref&siteid=bmjjournals |title=Richard Budgett: Olympic challenge |last=Coombes |first=Rebecca |date=2 June 2010 |work=British Medical Journal |publisher= |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Carman |first=Tim |date=18 July 2012 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/mcdonalds-olympian-achievement-in-london-a-french-fry-monopoly-and-largest-fast-food-restaurant/2012/07/18/gJQAZ6tQuW_story.html |title=McDonald's Olympian achievement in London: A French fry monopoly and largest fast-food restaurant |work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Blitz |first=Roger |date=15 July 2012 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a137e770-ce90-11e1-9fa7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz21F2vVuDK |title=McDonald's launches Olympics ad campaign |work=Financial Times |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Martin |first=Sami K. |date=10 July 2012 |url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/olympics-mcdonalds-coca-cola-support-selling-out-for-a-financial-fix-77978/ |title=Olympics McDonald's, Coca-Cola Support: Selling Out for a Financial Fix? |work=The Christian Post}}</ref> Critics have included the Chief Medical Officer of Wales, Dr Tony Jewell,<ref>{{cite news |last=McWatt |first=Julia |date=11 July 2012 |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2012/07/11/mcdonald-s-and-coca-cola-should-have-no-place-in-olympics-says-wales-top-doctor-91466-31367506/ |title=McDonald's and Coca Cola should have no place in Olympics, says Wales' top doctor" |publisher=WalesOnline}}</ref> and the head of sports science of the GB Team.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rowley |first=Tom |date=19 July 2012 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/9412953/London-2012-Olympics-McDonalds-the-wrong-choice-for-athletes-says-Team-GB-sport-science-head.html |title=London 2012 Olympics: McDonald's 'the wrong choice' for athletes, says Team GB sport science head" |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London}}</ref> The [[London Assembly]] passed a motion calling for a ban on junk-food sponsors.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9347221/London-2012-Olympics-Assembly-calls-for-ban-on-junk-food-sponsors.html |title= London 2012 Olympics: Assembly calls for ban on junk food sponsors |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=21 June 2012 |location =London}}</ref>

The sponsors were defended on the grounds that they provide a significant income for the event.<ref name=Coombes/> [[Jacques Rogge]], President of the IOC, acknowledged concerns but noted the importance of sponsorship money and said that the issue of obesity had been raised with such sponsors.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/9385751/IOC-chief-Jacques-Rogge-admits-question-mark-over-McDonalds-and-Coca-Cola-sponsoring-Olympics.html |title=IOC chief Jacques Rogge admits 'question mark' over McDonald's and Coca-Cola sponsoring Olympics |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=21 July 2012 |location =London}}</ref> McDonald's and Coca-Cola also defended their involvement, stating that healthy eating was the responsibility of the individual to make their own purchasing choices.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/news/mcdonalds-coke-defend-olympic-choice/4002621.article |title=McDonald's, Coke defend Olympic choice |last=O'Reilly |first=Lara |newspaper=Marketing Week |date=10 July 2012 |location =London}}</ref> Locog's policy for food provision states a number of aims including diversity, hygiene, health and nutrition and [[sustainability]].<ref name=logoc-food>{{cite web |title=LOCOG food vision|url=http://www.london2012.com/about-us/sustainability/food-vision/|work=London2012 website|publisher=LOCOG|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

====Dow Chemical====
The IOC and LOCOG have drawn criticism for accepting [[Dow Chemical Company]] as a partner for the London Games.<ref name=hindu-standbehinddow>{{cite news |url= http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2971802.ece |first=Mahim Pratap |last=Singh |title=We stand behind Dow: London Olympic panel |newspaper=The Hindu |date=8 March 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref> Human rights activists have been campaigning to get Dow Chemical to clean up the contamination in [[Bhopal]], [[India]], where gas leak at a [[Union Carbide]] plant in 1984 [[Bhopal disaster|killed 2,259 people]].

[it] has received several awards and accolades in this regard over the last few years."<ref name=hindu-standbehinddow/> Dow said it was surprised by the controversy because Dow never had a plant in Bhopal, and did not acquire any of the connection with Bhopal. Dow acquired Union Carbide in 2001, 12 years after Union Carbide had settled with the Government of India and Bhopal victims.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/20/us-dowchemical-olympics-idUSTRE81J10D20120220 | title=Dow Chemical's Olympic PR push dogged by Bhopal | work=Reuters | date=20 February 2012 | accessdate=12 July 2012 | last=Scheyder |first=Ernest | location=New York}}</ref>

===Security===

====Air defence sites====
The decision by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] to station [[surface-to-air missile]]s on top of the Lexington building, a residential [[tower block|apartment block]] in [[Bow, London|Bow]], was challenged in court on 10 July by residents of another tower Fred Wigg Tower in [[Leytonstone]], east London, where missiles were to be sited, under Article 8 and Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], over concerns the missiles made them a terrorist target. The judgement from Mr Justice Haddon-Cave was in favour of the siting of the missiles on Fred Wigg Tower. He stated in his judgement <blockquote>Residents were under something of a misapprehension regarding the equipment and risks.... The MoD's voluntary engagement with the community over the plans was immaculate and the residents who challenged the missile sites had misunderstood the facts.</blockquote>  David Enright, the Solicitor representing the residents said after the judgement: <blockquote>The clear implication of today's judgement is that the Ministry of Defence now has the power to militarise the private homes of any person.</blockquote><ref name=guardian-olympic-missiles>{{cite news

====Security guard shortage====
In July 2012 the private security firm [[G4S]], which had been contracted to supply security personnel for the Olympics, revealed that it had failed to recruit and train enough staff for the Games. The shortfall was made up by deploying 3,500 troops of [[HM Armed Forces|the armed forces]]. Reports in the media claimed some recruits were not able to speak adequate English.<ref name=nyt120714>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/sports/olympics/major-trepidation-over-olympic-security.html?pagewanted=all | title = Amid Reports of Ineptitude, Concerns Over Security at London Olympics | first = John F. | last = Burns | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 14 July 2012 }}</ref><ref name=tel120714>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/9399841/Olympics-I-dont-know-if-guards-speak-English-says-G4S-chief.html | title = Olympics: 'I don't know if guards speak English', says G4S chief | first = Laura | last= Donnelly | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 14 July 2012 }}</ref>

====Regent Street flags display====
As part of the build up to the Games, the flags of all competing nations were suspended over streets in a display around the [[West End of London]] by the Regent Street Association (RSA). Included in this was the [[Flag of the Republic of China]].<ref name="Taipei Times">{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/07/26/2003538672 |title=Mystery shrouds removal of ROC flag in London |newspaper=Taipei Times|date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> Since 1981, the Republic of China has not been permitted to compete at the Olympics under its own name, instead using the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]", together with the [[Chinese Taipei Olympic flag|flag]] of the [[Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee]], which is not Taiwan's national flag. In all official Olympic events and publications, the name and symbols of Chinese Taipei must be used. The flag display was not connected to [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games|LOCOG]], and  not subject to Olympic branding rules. Officials from the [[China|People's Republic of China]] made a complaint to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]] (FCO) about the display of national flag of the Republic of China.

====Russian biographies====
A complaint by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Foreign Ministry of Ukraine]] was made about the biographies of Russian Olympic team members posted on the official London 2012 Games' website. The biographies referred to the athletes' Ukrainian birthplaces as being located in Russia.<ref name="kyiv_post">{{cite news|title=Russia 'Annexes' Ukraine |url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/russia-annexes-ukraine.html|work=[[Kyiv Post]]|accessdate=28 July 2012|date=26 July 2012|last1=Parusinski|first1=Jakub |last2=Rachkevych|first2=Mark |last3=Onyshkiv|first3=Yuriy }}</ref> Thirty athletes were identified as not being born in Russia had incorrect birthplace references.<ref name="kyiv_post"/> Georgia<U+2019>s Olympic Committee has also expressed outrage and is demanding correction.

====Bahraini uprising====
In June 2012, the Berlin-based [[European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights]] (ECCHR) urged British authorities to ban the president of the [[Bahrain Olympic Committee]], [[Nasser bin Hamad Al Khalifa]] from entering the UK during the games. Prince Nasser, son of [[Bahrain]]'s King [[Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] and the commander of the [[Royal Guard (Bahrain)|Royal Guard]] has been accused of [[Torture during the 2011<U+2013>2012 Bahraini uprising|torture and human rights violations]] during the [[Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)|2011-2012 Bahraini uprising]].<ref name=guardian>{{cite news |last=Black |first=Ian |title=Britain urged to ban royal head of Bahrain Olympic committee |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/20/bahrain-olympic-prince-human-rights |newspaper=The Guardian |location =London |date=20 June 2012}}</ref> The ECCHR claimed that Prince Nasser launched "a punitive campaign to repress Bahraini athletes who had demonstrated their support (for) the peaceful [[Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)|pro-democracy movement]]". It said that, following his directive, "more than 150 professional athletes, coaches and referees were subjected to arbitrary arrests, night raids, detention, abuse and torture by electric cables and other means".<ref name=guardian/>  The call to ban Prince Nasser from entering the UK was supported by global activist group [[Avaaz]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Prevent Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad al Khalifa of Bahrain from attending the London Olympics 2012 |url= http://www.avaaz.org/en/petition/To_Prevent_Sheikh_Nasser_bin_Hamad_alKhalifa_of_Bahrain_from_attending_the_London_Olympics_2012/ |publisher=[[Avaaz]] |accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> and British Member of Parliament [[George Galloway]], who warned that he would attempt to make a [[citizen's arrest]] of the prince if he comes to London.<ref>{{cite episode

====Syrian uprising====
According to media reports, General Mowaffak Joumaa, the head of the [[Syrian Olympic Committee]], was refused an entry visa to the UK for the games due to his links to Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s regime, which had by the time of the games and since March 2011, been fighting a [[Syrian Civil War (2011<U+2013>present)|civil war]]. The UK Home Office would not confirm this due to a policy of not commenting on individual cases, although the deputy Prime Minister [[Nick Clegg]] had previously stated that officials with connections to the Assad regime would be prevented from attending the games. In anticipation of just such a ban, Joumaa had said in April 2012 that "Once I am blacklisted, it would be an honor for me to be one of the citizens who were banned from entering Britain because of their country's dignity and freedom".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57459057/syrian-olympic-chief-barred-from-britain-for-olympics |title=Syrian Olympic chief barred from Britain for Olympics |publisher=CBS News |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] pledged that athletes would not be punished "for the sins of the regime", and the [[Syria at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Syrian team]] duly sent ten athletes to compete in seven sports.

===Miscellaneous===

====Criminal damage arrests====
[[Darren Cullen]], a [[Graffiti|Graffiti artist]] who had been commissioned by [[Team GB]] to produce artwork for the [[Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics|Olympic and Paralympic village]], was arrested by the [[British Transport Police]] and banned from Olympic venues and from travelling by train and Underground for a period of six months for alleged "incitement to commit [[Criminal damage in English law|criminal damage]]". His arrest was criticised by human rights campaigners.<ref name=bbc-july-2012>{{cite news|title=London 2012: Outrage over artist banned from Olympics|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18927228|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Graffiti artist who worked for Adidas is banned from Olympic Games venues|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jul/18/graffiti-artist-adidas-banned-olympic|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=18 July 2012|first1=Esther |last1=Addley|first2=Sandra |lastLaville |first3=Ben |last3=Quinn}}</ref>

In the week before the Games began, a group of political activists in the GreenWash Gold 2012 group taking part in a [[street theatre]] protest in [[Trafalgar Square]] against the choice of Olympic sponsors were arrested by [[Metropolitan Police Service|London police]] on a charge of [[Criminal damage in English law|criminal damage]]; according to reports, during their act they spilled [[custard]] on the paving stones which the police assumed to be paint. The police action was criticised by Meredith Alexander, a former member of the Commission for a Sustainable London 2012.<ref name=guardian-custard>{{cite news|last=Laville|first=Sandra|title=Police arrested actors for spilling custard, say Olympic protesters|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/20/police-arrested-actors-olympic-custard|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=26 July 2012|date=20 July 2012}}</ref>{{weight|date=July 2012}}

====Great Britain in football====
The reactivation of the men's [[Great Britain Olympic football team]], which had not played since 1972, and not appeared at an actual games since 1960 and the creation of a [[Great Britain women's Olympic football team|women's team]], was seen as controversial by many{{who|date=August 2012}} due to the fact that in international [[association football|football]], the UK's four [[Home Nations]] normally compete with their own respective teams: [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]].<ref name="Gibson">{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Owen|title=Sports minister wants GB football team at Olympics after London 2012|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/25/sports-minister-gb-football-team-olympics|newspaper=Guardian|date=25 April 2012}}</ref>  World football's governing body [[FIFA]], sent reassurances to the [[Scottish Football Association|Scottish]], [[Irish Football Association|Northern Irish]] and [[Football Association of Wales|Welsh]] national football associations. The three association still declined to take part in organising the team, fearing it would threaten their independence on the world stage. This left the English [[Football Association]] as organisers of the GB team for London 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/7785935.stm |title=Olympics &#124; GB football team gets Fifa assent |publisher=BBC News |date=20 December 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/15382675 |title=London 2012: Stuart Pearce and Hope Powell to lead GB teams |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> The other associations were not allowed to prevent players from their association being selected; players sent to the games comprised both English and Welsh players in the men's squad and English and Scottish in the women's.<ref>{{cite news|last=Idessane |first=Kheredine |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18653453 |title=London 2012: No Scotland or N Ireland in Olympic football squad |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 June 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/18592483 |title=Team GB women's squad for London 2012 announced |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> Suggestions that the reactivation should be permanent have been supported in principle by the [[Professional Footballers' Association]], but the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish Football Associations have expressed opposition.<ref name="Gibson"/> Participation in future Olympics would be complicated by the fact that the qualification route is through the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Under-21 Championship]], in which the home nations already compete separately (as hosts for 2012, GB did not need to qualify for the 2012 games).

====Landlord conduct====
In February 2012, the housing charity [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]] alleged reports of landlords in east London raising rents or writing clauses into new rental contracts so tenants must be away during the Olympics, but as of 2 February 2012 the [[Department of Communities and Local Government]] said it had no evidence of the practice.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tenants priced out of their homes by Olympics as landlords cash in |first=Fred |last=Attewill |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/olympics/889260-tenants-priced-out-of-their-homes-by-olympics-as-landlords-cash-in |newspaper=Metro |location =London |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref> However, an 8 May news report by the BBC noted that Shelter had seen "more evidence of landlords acting unscrupulously and evicting people illegally. One estate agent said properties typically rented for <U+00A3>350 per week were being marketed for <U+00A3>6,000 per week." The BBC report noted that, "The potential profits are leading to some private landlords telling their tenants they have to leave their homes, with little notice."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17986383 |title=Landlords 'Evicting Tenants' to Make Olympic Profit |publisher=BBC News |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref>

====Strike threats====
In a dispute over bonuses for working during the Olympics, the [[Unite the Union|Unite union]] organised an initial bus strike on 22 June affecting 17 [[Buses in London|London bus companies]], the first in London in decades, halted two thirds of services for 24 hours. Further strikes during the games were also threatened.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Edwards |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-18544552 |title=London bus workers' strike in Olympics pay row ends |publisher=BBC News |date=23 June 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In another dispute about Olympic bonuses, at the beginning of July the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT Union]] also balloted members at [[South West Trains]], [[Greater Anglia]] and [[First Great Western]], threatening strike action coinciding with the opening ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|first=Dick |last=Murray |url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/rail-company-defies-strike-threat-and-says-no-to-olympics-bonus-7903158.html |title=Rail company defies strike threat and says NO to Olympics bonus |newspaper=Evening Standard |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

A planned strike by the [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|ASLEF]] union which would have affected [[East Midlands Trains]] services for three days during the games, attracted criticism and even satire by American comedian [[Jon Stewart]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18997483 |title=Jon Stewart East Midlands Trains sketch was 'a bit of fun' |publisher=BBC News |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> It was called off on 26 July after a deal was reached.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19003940 |title=East Midlands Trains drivers call off Olympic train strike |publisher=BBC News |date=26 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> The union denied that the strike had been planned deliberately to coincide with the Olympics, claiming it had been a long running dispute unrelated to Olympics bonuses.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/story-16589781-detail/story.html |title=Train union boss 'received death threats over East Midlands strike' |publisher=This is Nottingham |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

On 18 July the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]] voted in favour of strike or other industrial action over the issue of job losses at the [[Home Office]]. It threatened to disrupt the games as immigration and border staff would be involved, leading Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to call it wrong and unjustified.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Gwyn |last1=Topham |first2=Nicholas |last2=Watt |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/19/cameron-condemns-border-strike-olympics?newsfeed=true |title=Cameron condemns border staff strike plans that threaten to hit Olympics |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 July 2012 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> The strike was eventually called off on 25 July, 45 minutes before a court hearing over the ballot's legality brought by the government, with ministers and the union disagreeing over the reasons for why it was called off.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18973127 |title=PCS union calls off pre-Olympics border staff strike |publisher=BBC News |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

====Traffic and games lanes====
{{POV|date=July 2012}}
The 48 kilometres of designated "Games Lanes" on London thoroughfares to be used between 06:00 and midnight by athletes, officials, journalists, emergency services, and sponsors were blamed for causing traffic jams. Londoners were advised to use public transportation to get to work, but on 25 July significant delays were experienced due to electrical and signal problems on the [[Central line|Central]] and [[Hammersmith & City line|Hammersmith & City]] [[London Underground|tube]] lines. The new River Thames cable car broke down for half an hour on the same day, stranding passengers above the river.

London taxi drivers protested that the traffic problems hampered their services to paying passengers trying to travel around the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/olympic-vip-lanes-baffle-anger-london-drivers-060508684--oly.html |title=Olympic VIP lanes baffle, anger London drivers |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> Lee Osbourne of the United Cabbies Group said: "We're not going to be able to drop passengers where they want to go. Traffic in London is pretty bad as it is, and now passengers are going to suffer with the meter just ticking away. Even on a normal day, driving in London is rarely a smooth experience. For a city of its size, it has surprisingly few highways or wide thoroughfares, which means that most roads have multiple traffic lights and pedestrian crossings." The head of road policy at [[The Automobile Association]] Paul Watters said: "Drivers do have somewhere to go, but it's been a bit confusing. We know it's going to be tricky and difficult, and it's bound to be full of teething problems. We're almost there now so hopefully it will be better." Driving in the lanes could be penalised by up to [[GBP|<U+00A3>]]130.<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=25 Jul 2012 |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-07-25/news/32848698_1_road-lanes-bus-lane-special-lanes |title=Olympic VIP lanes baffle, anger London drivers |work=Economic Times |date= |accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>

Concerns over traffic congestion were raised a month before the games when the critical part of the Olympic transport infrastructure, the [[M4 motorway]], had to be shut for emergency repairs. After a week long closure it reopened on 13 July, in time for the games.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tom |last=Lawrence |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/m4-reopens-after-repair-work-7941162.html |title=M4 reopens after repair work |publisher=The Independent |date=13 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> It again had to be closed on Monday 30 July, the first Olympic day where commuter traffic would also be on the roads, causing delays and traffic congestion, due to an accident.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hooton |first=Christopher |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/906753-m4-closure-provides-london-with-first-olympic-transport-test |title=David Cameron and Jacques Rogge use public transport at London 2012 |newspaper=Metro |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

====Cycling protest arrests====
The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] arrested 182 cyclists on 27 July who were taking part in a [[Critical Mass]] protest during the opening ceremony. The cyclists were [[kettling|kettled]] and then detained  overnight in a garage and on buses. Four cyclists were charged and the remainder were [[police bail|bailed]] with conditions including not entering the Olympic borough of [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]] on a bicycle, entering "any Olympic-only carriageway" or going within 100 metres of an Olympic venue. The cyclists were critical of the police response.<ref>{{cite news|last=Malik|first=Shav|title=Critical Mass arrests: police charge three|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jul/29/critical-mass-police-arrest-three|newspaper=Guardian|date=29 July 2012}}</ref>

====Low-carbon fuel solution for the flame of the Olympic torch====
[[LOCOG]], together with sustainability partner and sponsor [[EDF Energy]], committed in 2009 to provide "low-carbon fuel solution for the flames of the Olympic torch and the cauldron".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.london2012.com/mm%5CDocument%5CPublications%5CSustainability%5C01%5C24%5C07%5C91%5Clondon-2012-sustainability-plan.pdf |title=London 2012 Sustainability Plan 2nd Edition, December 2009 |publisher=London 2012 |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref> When the torch was unveiled on 8 June 2011 though London 2012's chairman [[Sebastian Coe]] had to admit the failure of the initiative, as "In simple terms, we didn't quite get there (...)

==During the Games==

===Spectator issues===

====Empty seats====
Empty seats at Olympic events were reported during the first two days of the games. Although events were reported to be sold out, many empty seats were observed in highly visible areas at multiple venues. Sebastian Coe, the Head of LOCOG, stated in a press conference on 29 July that the seats were reserved for "the Olympic family and sponsors" and that the events were otherwise "stuffed to the gunwales". The empty seats were also from NOCs which had not used up the entire allocation and had not returned the unallocated tickets. Coe stated that LOCOG would investigate the claims of empty seats.<ref name=tickets2012>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Andrew |title=Lord Coe claims Olympic venues are 'stuffed to the gunwales' |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/lord-coe-claims-olympic-venues-are-stuffed-to-the-gunwales-7985625.html |accessdate=30 July 2012|newspaper=The Independent |location =London |date=30 July 2012}}</ref> The claim the seats were allocated to sponsors led to denials from sponsors with British Airways stating they had returned tickets it could not distribute and McDonalds stating all their tickets were being used.<ref name=Sponsors>{{cite news |title=Q&A on why seats at Olympic venues are empty |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19037625 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=30 July 2012|date=29 July 2012}}</ref> LOCOG was able to recover some "VIP" seats that would not used and made them available for sale.

Ticket distribution follows this system: 75% is sold to the general public, 12% goes to the National Committees of participating countries for sale in their countries, 8% is for sponsors, and 5% for the "Olympic family" (including the IOC and national Olympic organizations).<ref name=focus>{{cite news| url=http://www.focus.de/sport/olympia-2012/tid-26751/leere-stadien-bei-olympia-2012-in-london-der-gastgeber-bleibt-draussen_aid_791773.html| first=Axel |last=Wolfsgruber |title=Der Gastgeber bleibt draussen.| publisher=[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]] |language=German| date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> It is hard at the venue to anticipate if tickets given to various sponsors and Olympic officials will actually be used, and difficult to reenter them into circulation at the last minute.<ref name=focus/>

====Football queues====
For the first football game at [[St James' Park]] there were long queues at the box office, leading to fans missing some of the game. A spokesman for Ticketmaster said: "...we saw extremely high numbers of spectators arriving at St James' Park to purchase football tickets on the day of the event....While Ticketmaster is contracted to manage the box offices at Olympic venues, the staff numbers at those venues are determined by LOCOG....We will continue to work closely with LOCOG to ensure that the box office staff levels are sufficient to meet the demands for ticket sales and collection." LOCOG described the situation as "totally and completely 100% unacceptable", and after changes were made in the process, the issue was reportedly avoided for the second round of matches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-19045401 |title=Olympic football ticket delays at St James' Park eased |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-19013655 |title=Olympic football delay at St James' Park 'unacceptable' |publisher=BBC News |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

====Non-public archery event====
On Friday, 27 July, the same day as the opening ceremony, but after the first sporting events outside London had started (in football), there was confusion and disappointment in some Olympic fans when they were denied access to what they thought was the first competition event in London. They had misunderstood the use by LOCOG of the phrase "non-ticketed" to mean that an archery qualification round at Lord's cricket ground was going to be open to the public for free, in a similar fashion to some other events like the road bike races or marathon. In addition, some had been sold fake tickets for the event by an illegal website. LOCOG stated "Tickets have not been advertised or sold by Locog for the archery ranking event...We have always made it clear that the preliminary rounds are not open for spectators. There are a number of unofficial websites claiming to sell tickets; we therefore advise people to be extremely cautious and vigilant when attempting to buy tickets and only purchase from an official source".<ref>{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Lizzy|title=Olympic archery fans feel duped after being shut out of event|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-archery-spectators-turned-away|newspaper=Guardian|date=27 July 2012}}</ref>

====VISA card payment crash====
During the football held at the [[Wembley Stadium]] on 29 July, fans were subjected to long queues in the ground at the [[concession stand]]s, after [[Visa Inc.|VISA]]'s card payment system crashed, leaving cash payment as the only alternative. The situation was compounded by the fact that as Visa had been granted exclusive rights to the Olympics, other cards could not be accepted as payment, and the number of [[Automated teller machine|cash machines]] in the stadium had been reduced after 27 that worked on the [[LINK (UK)|LINK]] system had been removed, to be replaced by 8 that could only be used by Visa cards.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/966545/olympics-anger-as-visa-cards-crash-at-wembley |title=Olympics: Anger As Visa Cards Crash At Wembley |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

===Competition issues===

====Men's Cycling Team Sprint====
On 2 August, British cyclist Philip Hindes, during an interview immediately after the race, said that he deliberately crashed in an earlier round because he did not like the start he had. British team later responded claiming it was a misunderstanding and comments were lost in translation. Hindes also later retracted his original comment and said he just lost control and fell down. In Team Sprint, cyclists are allowed a restart if they crash or have a mechanical incident. The International Cycling Union said the result of the qualifying race <U+201C>was not in question,<U+201D> and the International Olympic Committee said it would not investigate.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/cycling/9448399/London-2012-Olympics-Philip-Hindes-crash-sets-up-dash-to-Sir-Chris-Hoys-greatest-victory.html |title=London 2012 Olympics: Philip Hindes crash sets up dash to Sir Chris Hoy's 'greatest' victory |work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2012/08/03/british-cyclist-crash-purpose-set-restart-mens-sprint/22803/ |title=Did British cyclist crash on purpose to set up a restart in men<U+2019>s sprint? |newspaper=Denver Post |date=3 August 2012}}</ref> The French team, which came second, accepts that the better team won, but also suggests team sprint regulation needs to be changed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/03/us-oly-cycl-ctmspr-day7-rules-idUSBRE8720RM20120803 |title=Cycling: Team sprint rules should change, say French |publisher=Reuters |date=3 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-2182959/London-2012-Olympics-Chris-Hoys-gold-loses-gloss-crash-controversy.html |work+Daily Mail |title=London 2012 Olympics: Chris Hoy's gold loses gloss in crash controversy}}</ref>

====Men's Team Artistic gymnastics judging====
A judging controversy erupted at the [[Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's artistic team all-around|all-around team event]] on July 30 after Japan's [[K<U+014D>hei Uchimura]] had a bad dismount off the [[pommel horse]]. The initial judging dropped [[Japan at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Japan]] into fourth place, out of the medals, with [[China at the 2012 Summer Olympics|China]], [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] and [[Ukraine at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Ukraine]] taking gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. However, after Japan filed a protest, the judges reviewed the tape and credited Uchimura with a dismount instead of a missed dismount, determining that he did indeed perform the final handstand. This raised Japan's score by 0.7 points, moving them from fourth to the silver medal position, dropping Great Britain to bronze and Ukraine out of the medals.<ref name=NBC-Evening-30-07-2012>NBC, 2012 Olympic Summer Games - Evening, airdate: 30 July 2012</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher= Bleacher Report |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1278131-2012-olympic-mens-gymnastics-judges-us-fold-under-pressure-of-biggest-stage |title=2012 Olympic Men's Gymnastics: Judges, US Fold Under Pressure of Biggest Stage |first= Liviu |last=Bird |date= 30 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher= Bleacher Report |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1278162-mens-gymnastics-olympic-controversy-japan-takes-silver-great-britain-snubbed |title= Men's Gymnastics Olympic Controversy: Japan Takes Silver, Great Britain Snubbed |first=Patrick |last=Clarke |date=30 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |publisher= Daily Mail |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181141/Olympic-Gymnastics-2012-Team-GB-men-bronze-Japanese-appeal-robs-silver-medal.html |title= Robbed!

====Women's badminton doubles matches====
A review of two matches in the [[Badminton at the 2012 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's doubles|Badminton Women's doubles]] competition played on 31 July was conducted after it appeared that, having already qualified for the knockout stages, players on both sides in each game had been attempting to [[match fixing|lose their last group stage matches in order to gain a more favourable draw]] in the quarter finals. The matches were between China's [[Wang Xiaoli]] / [[Yu Yang (badminton)|Yu Yang]] and South Korea's [[Jung Kyung-eun]] / [[Kim Ha-na]] in Group A and South Korea's [[Ha Jung-eun]] / [[Kim Min-jung]] versus Indonesia's [[Meiliana Jauhari]] / [[Greysia Polii]] in Group C. After errors began occurring during routine shots in both matches, including shots going long and serves hitting the net, the crowd reacted badly,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19072677 Olympics badminton: fans jeer errors in doubles match] BBC Sport - Olympics</ref><ref>[http://www.espn.co.uk/london-olympics-2012/sport/story/163033.html Controversy erupts in 2012 badminton clash] ESPN</ref> and the match between Yu Yang and Wang Xiaoli of China and Jung Kyung and Kim Ha Na of South Korea featured no rallies of more than four shots.<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_sports/view/1217099/1/.html Olympics: Badminton players charged over 'thrown' matches] Channel NewsAsia</ref>

In the second game, a tournament referee initially issued a black card to disqualify the players but, after the team's coaches argued, this was rescinded; play was allowed to continue while he monitored proceedings. Both the earlier match and this later match were ultimately played to a conclusion, completing the draw for the quarter finals (Group B and D having concluded earlier in the day). Technical delegate Paisan Rangsikitpho said after the Group A match, "If it's true what I hear, this is a shame and I don't like it. And I'm not going to accept anything that I don't like at all. It's not in a good spirit....I apologise to the public, I apologise for everyone and I am not happy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ransom|first=Ian|title=Match fixing causes badminton chaos|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/match-fixing-causes-badminton-chaos-220650711--spt.html|accessdate=1 Augsust 2012|newspaper=Yahoo News|date=31 July 2012}}</ref>

On 1 August 2012, following the review, all eight players were ejected from the tournament by the [[Badminton World Federation]], after being found guilty of "not using best efforts" and "conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19072677 |title=Olympics badminton: Eight women disqualified from doubles |publisher=BBC Sport |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

====Women's team sprint====
China's [[Gong Jinjie]] and [[Guo Shuang]] twice set the world record, in qualifying and in the first round, and finished first in the final in 32.619. However, officials ruled the takeover between the pair was illegal and Germany, who clocked 32.798, were promoted to gold. Coach Daniel Morelon of France went so far as to deny that Guo Shuang and Gong Jinjie had violated any rules.

The organizing committee's official reports said the team had made an early relay, citing a specific regulation. China's appeal letter asserts that the regulation in question was not violated. The Chinese team claims the judges had a bad attitude when asked to watch a replay of the infraction.<ref name="chinadaily">{{cite news |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2012-08/04/content_15644267.htm |title=China appeals cycling decision |newspaper=China Daily |date=4 August 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}</ref>

====Women's football officiating====
=====Semifinal: Canada vs USA=====
During the semifinal match between [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] and [[United States women's national soccer team|USA]], a controversial delay of game call was made against the Canadian goalkeeper, [[Erin McLeod]], when she held the ball longer than the allowed 6 seconds. McLeod was technically in violation of the rule under a strict interpretation, but the rule is virtually never called in international football and is meant to be enforced only on clear and blatant instances of intentional time wasting. As a result of the call, the American side was awarded a rare indirect free kick in the box in the eightieth minute with Canada leading the match 3-2. On the ensuing play another controversial handball call was made against the Canadian side awarding the American team a penalty kick, which [[Abby Wambach]] converted to tie the game at 3-3.  Coincidentally, the handball call was made 10 minutes after a missed handball call in the American's box on [[Megan Rapinoe]]. The Americans went on to win the match in extra time, advancing to the gold medal match.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/controversy-mars-americans-4-3-win-over-canada-220231424.html |title=Controversy mars Americans<U+2019> 4-3 win over Canada, but shouldn<U+2019>t detract from a great game |publisher=Yahoo!

====Men's 100m breaststroke final====
Five days after setting a new world record in the 100 meter breaststroke final en route to a gold medal, South African [[Cameron van der Burgh]] admitted that he had used illegal "dolphin kicks" while underwater after the start and turns. Van der Burgh claimed that he had to break the rule because it is done so commonly by many international breaststrokers, saying, "It's got to the point where if you're not doing it you are falling behind or giving yourself a disadvantage." There have been complaints from other swimmers and swimming federations, with many calls for FINA to introduce underwater footage to help race officials, but no official protest has been launched against van der Burgh, who will keep his medal and record.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/london-games/south-african-cameron-van-der-burgh-admits-using-illegal-dolphin-kicks-to-win-gold-medal/story-e6frgdg6-1226442649149 |title=South African Cameron van der Burgh admits using illegal dolphin kicks to win gold medal |newspaper=The Australian |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>

====Men's 800m athletics heat====
Algerian runner [[Taoufik Makhloufi]] was believed to have had purposely stopped running and started walking before he walked out of the track. The I.A.A.F accused him of violating the Olympic ideal by not giving an honest effort. Suggested in his dismissal was that Makhloufi was trying to preserve his endurance for Tuesday<U+2019>s final of the 1,500 meters, at which he was considered a medal candidate. Algerian officials said that Makhloufi withdrew from the 800 because his knee was injured, not because he was tanking. After being examined by doctors, Makhloufi prevailed, was reinstated, then won gold in the 1,500 meter race.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/sports/olympics/algerian-runner-makhloufi-expelled-then-reinstated-at-olympics.html?_r=1 |title=After a Runner Stops, the Questioning Starts |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>

====North Korea <U+2013> South Korea flag confusion====
In the first day of the Olympic events on 25 July, during the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Women's tournament|women's football tournament]], the match between DPR Korea and Colombia was delayed by a little over an hour because the [[flag of South Korea]] was mistakenly displayed on the electronic scoreboard in [[Hampden Park]]. The DPR Korean team walked off the [[Association football pitch|pitch]] in protest at seeing the South Korean flag displayed by their names and refused to warm-up whilst the flag was being displayed. They also objected to the South Korean flag being displayed above the stadium, even though the flags of all the competing countries were being displayed. The game then commenced after a delay and rectification of the error.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.stv.tv/glasgow/112456-olympic-blunder-sees-north-korea-refuse-to-play-after-wrong-flag-raised/ |title=Hampden Olympic blunder sees North Korea delay game after wrong flag raised |last=Stuart |first=Gavin |work=stv.tv |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>

Andy Mitchell, venue media manager for the [[London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games|LOCOG]], read out a LOCOG statement shortly afterwards:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/olympics-organisers-sorry-over-north-korea-flag-mix-up |title=London 2012 'sorry' over North Korea flag mix-up |publisher=Channel 4 News |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref><ref name="bowater1">{{cite news |title=North Korea women footballers protest over flag gaffe|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9427788/North-Korea-women-footballers-protest-over-flag-gaffe.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref>

<blockquote>"Today ahead of the Women<U+2019>s football match at Hampden Park, the South Korean flag was shown on a big screen video package instead of the [[Flag of North Korea|North Korean flag]]. Clearly that is a mistake, we will apologise to the team and the National Olympic Committee and steps will be taken to ensure this does not happen again."</blockquote>

LOCOG's statement had to be reissued because it failed to use the nations' official titles, "Republic of Korea" and "Democratic People's Republic of Korea."<ref>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Olympics in flap over North Korean flag fiasco |newspaper=Japan Times |date=27 July 2012 |page=4}}</ref>

British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] added that it was an "honest mistake" and efforts would be undertaken to ensure such a mishap does not recur.  However, North Korean manager Sin Ui-gun expressed reservations about whether the incident was a mistake of intention and said: "We were angry because our players were introduced as if they were from South Korea, which may affect us greatly as you may know. Our team was not going to participate unless the problem was solved perfectly and fortunately some time later, the broadcasting was corrected and shown again live so we made up our mind to participate and go on with the match. If this matter cannot be solved, we thought going on was nonsense. Winning the game cannot compensate for that thing."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2012/07/201272610133885299.html |title=Olympics: Apology to N Korea over flag mix-up |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>
