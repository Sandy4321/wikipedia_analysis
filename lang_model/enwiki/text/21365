The '''Golden Bears football team''' is the [[college football]] team of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The team plays its home games at picturesque [[California Memorial Stadium]]. Built to honor Berkeley alumni, students, and other Californians who died in [[World War I]], and modeled after the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, Memorial Stadium was named one of the 40 best college football stadiums by the ''[[Sporting News]]''.<ref>[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/11/10_stadium_history.shtml Stadium History]</ref><ref>[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/recaps/20051101aba.html Hokiesports recap]</ref> The team also has produced two of the oddest and most memorable plays in college football: [[Roy Riegels|Roy "Wrong Way" Riegels]]' fumble recovery and run toward the Cal goal line in the 1929 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]], and [[The Play]] in the 1982 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] with the winning kickoff return after five laterals.  The current head coach is [[Jeff Tedford]], who began his tenure in 2002.

==History==
Football was first played on the Berkeley campus in 1882, albeit in a form that resembled [[Rugby Football|rugby]]. It was not until 1886 that [[American football]] began play. Football was put on hiatus in 1906 when it was decided by the administration that American football was too dangerous a sport and rugby once again took over the scene. Football returned for good in 1915 and Cal has fielded a team in every year since. 

===1920s "Wonder Teams"===
The 1920s saw the first golden age of California football, as the [[California Golden Bears|Golden Bears]] went 50 straight games without a defeat from 1920 to 1925, with a record of 46 wins and 4 ties. As of 2006, this is the 3rd longest unbeaten (not to be confused with winning) streak in NCAA history. The 1920-1924 squads were so dominant that they were nicknamed "The Wonder Teams."  The "Wonder Teams" were coached by [[Andy Smith (coach)|Andy Smith]].  One of the stars during this era was Brick Muller and the University later established a freshman leadership group called the Brick Muller Society.  Cal won four [[Pacific Coast Conference]] championships and made three trips to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] during this decade, in 1921 (28-0 win over [[Ohio State Buckeyes|Ohio State]]), 1922 (0-0 tie with [[Washington and Jefferson College]]), and 1929 (8-7 loss to [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]]). One of the most famous (or infamous) moments in college football history occurred in the 1929 Rose Bowl Game. In the second quarter, Cal's defense forced a Georgia Tech fumble on their own 30 yard line, and the loose ball was scooped up by Cal center [[Roy Riegels]].  He began to run towards the Georgia Tech end zone for a score, but then in trying to get around the Tech players he inexplicably turned around and headed in the other direction. Riegels advanced all the way to the Cal one yard line before teammate Benny Lom was able to stop him, whereupon he was immediately tackled by what seemed like the entire Georgia Tech team. Cal elected to punt on the next play; the punt was blocked for a [[Safety (football score)|safety]], giving the Yellow Jackets a 2-0 lead and what turned out to be the decisive points.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gtalumni.org/news/magazine/spr98/div04.html|title=Wrong Way Reigels|work=Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Spring 1998|accessdate=2007-09-15}}</ref>
[[Image:Cal, Stanford football game, Memorial Stadium, 1930.jpg|center|550px|thumb|Cal, Stanford football game, Memorial Stadium, 1930]]
California football also achieved success in the 1930s, winning the PCC championship three times and appearing in the Rose Bowl in 1938, where they beat [[University of Alabama athletics|Alabama]] 13-0. Because of its staunch defense, the 1937 squad that went to the Rose Bowl was coined "The Thunder Team." In 11 games, Cal limited its opponents to only 33 points and 1,126 total yards.

===1940s and 50s: Pappy's Boys===
The early 1940s witnessed average success, but 1947 saw a dramatic turnaround as [[Lynn "Pappy" Waldorf]] became the head coach. Known as "Pappy's Boys," the Cal teams of 1947-1950 won 33 consecutive regular season games, earning three PCC championships and three Rose Bowl berths.<ref> "Pappy's Boys" still hold an annual reunion each June at the Lair of the Bear, a family camp run by the California Alumni Association. </ref> However Cal lost all three Rose Bowls (20-14 to [[Northwestern Wildcats|Northwestern]] in 1949, 17-14 to Ohio State in 1950, and 14&ndash;6 to [[University of Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]] in 1951). Pappy Waldorf left Cal after the 1956 season, having compiled a record of 67-32-4. Cal again earned a conference title in 1958 and subsequently played in the 1959 Rose Bowl, where it lost to [[Iowa Hawkeyes|Iowa]] 38&ndash;12.

===1960s to 80s: Campus turmoil and football mediocrity===
The 1960s was a period of particular mediocrity.  [[Marv Levy]] coached during the early 60's.  Levy's best record during his four season tenure as head coach at Cal from 1960&ndash;1963 was 4&ndash;5&ndash;1.  Cal had only one winning season (1968), although in that year after beating Syracuse Cal was ranked in the top 15.  The coach during this era was [[Ray Willsey]].  [[Craig Morton]], future [[Super Bowl]] quarterback for the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Denver Broncos]], was an All-American in 1964.

In 1972, [[Mike White (American football)|Mike White]] was hired. After two losing seasons, he brought home three winning seasons over the next four. In 1975, behind an NCAA leading offense anchored by [[All American]]s [[Chuck Muncie]], [[Joe Roth (American football)|Joe Roth]], [[Wesley Walker]], [[Steve Rivera]] and [[Ted Albrecht]], the Golden Bears were co-Champions of the Pacific 8 Conference, but [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]] went to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] based on their head-to-head victory. [[Steve Bartkowski]] ('75) was another noted player who started for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] at quarterback. However, White left in a storm of controversy over recruiting violations. [[Roger Theder]] succeeded him and led the Bears to three winning seasons, but each was less successful than its predecessor. In 1979, Cal played in the [[Garden State Bowl]], losing to [[Temple Owls|Temple]] 28&ndash;17 after a 6&ndash;5 regular season.

The 1980s saw a return to mediocrity, with Cal posting only one winning season in the entire decade. [[Joe Kapp]] was the most famous coach in this period.  Kapp had been the quarterback of the 1959 Rose Bowl team, and later led the [[Minnesota Vikings]] to the [[Super Bowl]].  Even so, he was not able to overcome the recruiting drag created by the off-field notoriety of the Berkeley campus.  Of note, however, was the 1982 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] versus [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]], which became famous for [[The Play]].  After Stanford had taken the lead on a field goal with four seconds left, the Golden Bears used five lateral passes on the ensuing kickoff return to score the winning touchdown and turn defeat into a 25-20 victory. The Play has been named by numerous media organizations as one of the best football, and even American sports, moments.<ref> See extended discussion in [[The Play]]. </ref>

===1990s: A brief return of football success===
[[Bruce Snyder]] arrived at Berkeley in 1987, and gradually turned the program around.  He was able to recruit a number of outstanding players, such as Russell White, away from football powers such as [[USC Trojans football|USC]] and [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]].  The reemergence of Cal football as a thriving program was signaled by the October 19, 1991 game against the future national co-champion [[Washington Huskies football|Washington Huskies]].  Cal lost 24&ndash;17 at home in a game that came down to the Bears' last possession deep in Husky territory and was probably the Huskies most difficult game that season.  (The [[Oakland Fire]] erupted in the hills south of [[California Memorial Stadium]] the next day.) Cal football had some success in the early 1990s, earning three postseason bowl berths and winning all three. Cal beat [[University of Wyoming|Wyoming]] 17&ndash;15 in the [[Copper Bowl]] of 1990, [[Clemson University|Clemson]] 37&ndash;13 in the 1992 [[Capital One Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] and Iowa 37-3 in the 1993 [[Alamo Bowl]]. Snyder resigned before 1992 bowl game to take a position at Pac-10 rival [[Arizona State Sun Devils|Arizona State.]] The Golden Bears attempted to steal some of the Huskies' magic by hiring away assistant [[Keith Gilbertson]], but he delivered only one winning season in the next four.

After the loss of momentum, Cal hired [[Green Bay Packers]] assistant [[Steve Mariucci]] for the 1996 season.  He lead the Bears to a winning regular season (losing to [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in the [[Aloha Bowl]] 42&ndash;38), but the [[San Francisco 49ers]] struck yet again (as with Waldorf) and hired away Mariucci as head coach for 1997, ending the promise of an early Cal revival. The rest the late 1990s saw little success, and the down period reached its nadir in 2001 when the Bears managed only one victory the entire season. The win came in the final game of the season in New Jersey against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] which was re-scheduled due to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  Much-maligned coach [[Tom Holmoe]] resigned in November of this season and was replaced with [[Jeff Tedford]], previously the offensive coordinator for the [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon Ducks]].  Worse yet, Cal lost seven straight games to archrival [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]].

===Tedford Era===
California began a renaissance under Tedford, who dramatically turned around the long-suffering program. Under Tedford the Golden Bears have posted seven consecutive winning seasons, a feat that hasn't been accomplished since the days of Pappy Waldorf.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://calbears.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/030207aac.html| title=Cal Football website | accessdate=2007-10-15.}} </ref>  After being ruled ineligible for a bowl game in 2002 due to academic infractions under the previous administration, Cal has also appeared in six straight bowl games.

The Jeff Tedford era began with a bang, as California defeated [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]] 70&ndash;22, and went on to finish 7&ndash;5, their first winning season since 1993. The 2002 team defeated three nationally ranked opponents on the road for the first time in school history including Cal's first win over conference foe [[Washington Huskies|Washington]] in 26 years, and won the annual [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] against archrival Stanford for the first time in eight years.

In 2003 the Golden Bears posted an 8&ndash;6 record, highlighted by a dramatic 34-31 triple-overtime victory over No. 3 ranked and eventual national co-champion [[USC Trojans football|USC]].  This victory revived a long moribund rivalry with the Trojans, even as the Trojans reemerged as a national power under [[Pete Carroll]].  In the [[Insight Bowl]], the Bears edged [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] 52&ndash;49 on a last-second field goal.

====2004 Bowl Championship Series controversy====
[[Image:Big Game Play 2.jpg|right|thumb|2004 Big Game]]
In 2004, the Bears posted a 10&ndash;2 record under Tedford and [[quarterback]] [[Aaron Rodgers]], with their only regular season loss coming against the eventual national champion, USC. California finished the regular season ranked No. 4 according to polls, and appeared to have an excellent chance to receive an at-large [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl berth, most likely in the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]].  Under normal circumstances, the Bears, as Pac-10 runner-up, would have had first crack at a Rose Bowl berth since conference champion USC was playing for the national championship.

Nonetheless, in a controversial case, the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas]] coach [[Mack Brown]] made impassioned pleas to media asking poll voters reconsider their final votes. 10-1 Cal was mysteriously rated as low as 7th by some coaches, and Texas received an increase in votes in the last Coaches Poll of the season despite Cal's win in their final game, allowing the Longhorns to pass the Bears into the No. 4 spot in the BCS rankings and guaranteeing Texas the BCS berth. The Longhorns went on to beat Michigan 38&ndash;37 in the Rose Bowl, while Cal was upset by No. 21 Texas Tech 45&ndash;31 in the [[Holiday Bowl]] and finished the season ranked No. 9.

====2005 to present====
The next year saw inconsistent quarterback play and an overall inexperienced roster. [[Nate Longshore]], who was chosen to succeed Aaron Rodgers, who had left for the NFL, sustained a season-ending injury in the season's first game against Sacramento State. He was succeeded by junior transfer [[Joe Ayoob]], who started nine games and went 5-4. Third string quarterback Steve Levy replaced Ayoob as the starter for the Big Game, leading the Bears to victory. Cal finished 8-4 and earned a berth in the 2005 [[Las Vegas Bowl]], beating [[BYU Cougars|BYU]] 35&ndash;28. 

[[Image:Big Game 2006.JPG|left|thumb|Big Game at California 2006. Cal fans rush the field.]]
In 2006, Cal went on to post a 10&ndash;3 (7&ndash;2 in Pac-10) record. Despite falling to the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]] in their first game of the season in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], the team rebounded, winning eight straight games, including impressive victories over the 20th ranked [[2006 Arizona State Sun Devils football team|Arizona State]] and the 11th ranked [[2006 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] at home. Two losses followed with a November 11, upset 24&ndash;20 by [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]] and a 23-9 defeat by [[2006 USC Trojans football team|USC]], which cost Cal its [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] bid. In the final game of the regular season on [[December 2]], Cal defeated Stanford 26-17 in the 109th ''[[Big Game (football)|Big Game]]'' for the fifth straight time. Coupled with UCLA's upset of reigning conference champion USC on the same day, the victory earned Cal its first share of the Pac-10 champsionship since 1975.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=263360025|title=Cal continues recent dominance of Stanford|work=ESPNU|publisher=ESPN|date=2006-12-02|accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref> Cal accepted an invitation to the [[2006 Holiday Bowl]], its second appearance there in three years.  Cal routed [[2006 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] 45-10, the largest margin of victory for a bowl game in the 2006-2007 season, and finished with a No. 14 ranking, an improvement from the No. 20 spot that it started with at the beginning of the season.

Cal began the 2007 season ranked 12th in both the AP/USA Today Polls. In a nationally televised game on September 1, the Bears defeated [[2007 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] 45-31. The Bears rose in the polls following subsequent victories against [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State]], [[Louisiana Tech]], and Arizona. Cal's defeat of then No. 11 Oregon in Eugene 31-24, combined with a series of losses from Oklahoma, Florida, and West Virginia, allowed Cal to break into the top five. Cal had a bye the following week, but as a result of Stanford's surprise upset of then No. 2 [[2007 USC Trojans football team|USC]] on October 6, the Bears were ranked No. 2 in the country in the AP, Coaches, and Harris polls behind No. 1 [[2007 Louisiana State Tigers football team|LSU]]. This was the highest the team had been ranked since 1951.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jR46pPLXtPslhqRzHZVqLn9d7slgD8S4K0I80|title=It's Unanimous: LSU No. 1 in AP's Top 25|work=AP|publisher=AP|date=2007-10-07|accessdate=2007-10-07}}</ref>

With the Kentucky upset of LSU on October 13, the Bears had a shot at being the number one team in the nation along with [[2007 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], but an upset loss to unranked [[2007 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] that same night dashed any hopes of a top ranking. The loss marked the beginning of a reversal in the second half of the season which saw the Bears winning only one game out of the next six and dropping out of the Top 25 entirely. The Bears lost to [[2007 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] for the first time in five years and to [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] on the 25th anniversary of The Play, which resulted in the Cardinal regaining [[The Stanford Axe]] for the first time in six years under first year head coach [[Jim Harbaugh]]. Cal accepted an invitation to the [[2007 Armed Forces Bowl]] against [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] on December 31, where post a 42&ndash;36 victory to end the season 7-6. Before the season even ended, Tedford declared there would be open competition for all positions on the team in 2008 and reevaluate every aspect of Cal's football program.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/30/SPKVU6S5O.DTL Open competition for all positions in '08]</ref><ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/01/07/SPNRUADR0.DTL Cal's staff gets a shuffle]</ref>  Tedford made several coaching changes, most notably relinquishing offensive coordinator duties and hiring [[Frank Cignetti (quarterbacks coach)|Frank Cignetti]] to playcall and take over quarterback coaching duties.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3184154 Cal coach Tedford makes changes to coaching staff]</ref>

Cal's 2008 campaign was marked with diminished expectations, as all of Cal's offensive stars at their skill positions ([[DeSean Jackson]], [[Lavelle Hawkins]], [[Robert Jordan (American football player)|Robert Jordan]], [[Justin Forsett]] and [[Craig Stevens (American football)|Craig Stevens]]) graduated or declared for the NFL Draft. Thus the Bears started the season unranked for the first time since 2003.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankingsindex?seasonYear=2008&weekNumber=1&seasonType=2 2008 Preseason Rankings via ESPN]</ref> Their 2008 season would confirm this ranking, as they would finish the season undefeated at home but would only win one game on the road. The Bears won their opening game at home against [[2008 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] 38-31 and eviscerated [[2008 Washington State Cougars football team|Washington State]] in Pullman 66&ndash;3, but fell to [[2008 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]] 35&ndash;27 in College Park. The Bears won two straight home games against Colorado State and [[2008 Arizona State Sun Devils football team|Arizona State]] but fell in the desert to [[2008 Arizona Wildcats football team|Arizona]]. Although the Bears still controlled their destiny in the Pac-10 after two more home wins against [[2008 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] and [[2008 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]], two close losses to Pac-10 champion contenders [[2008 USC Trojans football team|USC]] and [[2008 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]] on the road put an end to those hopes. Cal reclaimed the Axe by beating Stanford 37&ndash;16 in the 111th Big Game and kept Washington's season winless with a 48-7 victory. Cal finished the regular season 8&ndash;4 as Tedford claimed his seventh consecutive winning season for the Golden Bears and third unbeaten home record in five years. The Bears accepted an invitation to take on the [[2008 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]] at the [[2008 Emerald Bowl]], which they won 24&ndash;17.

Tedford also has become a noted quarterback coach.  After developing [[Joey Harrington]] at Oregon he produced two quarterbacks who went high in the [[NFL draft]], [[Kyle Boller]] in the 2003 draft, and [[Aaron Rodgers]] in the 2005 draft.  However, Tedford also was able to cobble together winning seasons in 2005, 2007 and 2008 without an outstanding quarterback.
