'''MS ''West Honaker''''' was a [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered [[cargo ship]] of the {{USMC|first=long}} that was sunk as part of the "gooseberry" [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] off [[Utah Beach]] during the [[Normandy invasion]]. The ship was originally built as '''SS ''West Honaker''''', a [[steam engine|steam]]-powered cargo ship built for the {{USSB|first=long}}, a predecessor of the {{USMC}}. At the time of her completion in 1920, the ship was inspected by the [[United States Navy]] for possible use as '''USS ''West Honaker'' (ID-4455)''' but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] under that name.

''West Honaker'' was built in 1920 for the {{USSB}}, as a part of the ''West'' boats, a series of steel-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed cargo ships built on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the World War I war effort, and was the 28th ship built at [[Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company]] in [[San Pedro, California]]. In 1926, ''West Honaker'' was outfitted with diesel engines that replaced her original steam engines as part of a pilot program by the {{USSB}}. After her conversion, she sailed on a [[New York City|New York]] <U+2013> [[Australia]] route. On her second trip to Australia, from August 1927 to March 1928, she became the first diesel ship to [[circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] the globe. In 1929, she began sailing for an around-the-world cargo service from the [[Pacific coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] to [[South Africa]]

By the late 1930s, she had been laid up, but was reactivated for merchant service prior to [[World War II]]. She sailed to Australia and [[New Zealand]] until after the United States' entry into World War II, and in transatlantic service to the United Kingdom for most of the time after that. In March 1944, she sailed from the United States for the final time, and was [[scuttle]]d in June as part of the "gooseberry" [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] off [[Utah Beach]] during the [[Normandy invasion]], earning a [[battle star]] in the process.

== Design and construction ==
The ''West'' ships were [[cargo ship]]s of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the {{USSB|first=long}} for emergency use during [[World War I]]. All were given names that began with the word ''West'', like ''West Honaker'',<ref name=CW-358>Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358<U+2013>59.</ref> the one of some 40 ''West'' ships built by the [[Los Angeles Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company]] of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].<ref name=Colton /> ''West Honaker'' (Los Angeles Shipbuilding yard number 28)<ref name=Colton /> was completed in December 1920.<ref name=Colton />

''West Honaker'' was {{GRT|5,376|first=yes}}, and was {{convert|410|ft|1|in|m}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]])<ref name=Miramar />  and {{convert|54|ft|2|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]]. She had a steel [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] and a [[deadweight tonnage]] of {{DWT|8,006}}.<!-- DWT --><ref name=Jordan /><ref name=DANFS>{{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = West Honaker | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w5/west_honaker.htm | short = on }}</ref><!-- steel hull --> Sources do not give ''West Honaker''{{'}}s other hull characteristics, but {{SS|West Grama||2}}, a [[sister ship]] also built at Los Angeles Shipbuilding had a [[displacement]] of 12,225<U+00A0>t with a [[mean]] [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|24|ft|2|in|m}}, and a [[hold (ship)|hold]] {{convert|29|ft|9|in|m}} deep.<ref>{{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = West Grama | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/w5/west_grama.htm | short = on }}</ref> ''West Honaker''{{'}}s power plant consisted of a single [[triple-expansion steam engine]] that drove a single [[screw propeller]] which moved the ship at up to {{convert|11.5|knots|km/h}}.<ref name=Miramar />

== Early career ==
''West Honaker'' was inspected by the [[United States Navy]] after completion for possible use as as service [[collier (ship)|collier]] and was assigned the identification number of 4455. Had she been [[ship commissioning|commissioned]], she would have been known as USS ''West Honaker'' (ID-4455), but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her.<ref name=DANFS />

Destinations and cargo during ''West Honaker''{{'}}s first six years of service are largely unreported in sources. In 1926, however, she was the first ship in a {{USSB}} pilot program to replace steam engines of seven {{USSB}}-owned ships with [[diesel engine]]s.<ref name=CSM-shipping_board>{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Shipping board craft dieselized | work = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] | date = 27 November 1926 | page = 1 }}</ref> ''West Honaker''{{'}}s {{convert|3000|hp|adj=on}} engine,<ref name=CSM-dieselized>{{cite news | title = Dieselized ship has trial trip | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 29 November 1926 | page = 5B }}</ref> reported by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as the largest American-made diesel equipment to that time,<ref name=WP-wall_street>{{cite news | title = Wall Street news briefs | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 28 November 1926 | page = M28}}</ref> was built by [[McIntosh & Seymour]] and installed at the [[Fore River Shipyard]] near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].<ref name=CSM-dieselized /> An [[Associated Press]] news item reported that the ship's $1,000,000 conversion,<ref name=LAT-south_african>{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B. | title = South African service opens | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 11 August 1929 | page = A12 }}</ref> which extended the ship's cruising radius from {{convert|7300|nmi|km}} to {{convert|17600|nmi|km}},<ref name=LAT-local_shipyard /> would lower her cost of operation by 15% annually.<ref name=CSM-shipping_board /> After her [[sea trial]]s were complete, ''West Honaker'' sailed to [[Savannah, Georgia]], where she began carrying cotton from that port to [[Bremen]].<ref name=CSM-dieselized />

In January 1927, the {{USSB}} established the Atlantic Australian Line, an all-diesel [[New York City|New York]] <U+2013> [[Australia]] service, and assigned ''West Honaker'' to the company.<ref name=LAT-local_shipyard /> The eight ships in the service<U+2014>operated by the [[Roosevelt Steamship Company]] in conjunction with another {{USSB}}-line, the American India Line<U+2014>sailed east from New York via the [[Suez Canal]] through the [[Indian Ocean]] and on to Australia and back via the same route.<ref>{{cite news | title = Australia-India & Return via Suez | format = brochure | publisher = Roosevelt Steamship Company | date = 1928 }} Summary of brochure available from [http://www.timetableimages.com/maritime/images/archives.htm#roose Maritime Timetable Images].

== South African service ==
In February 1929, ''West Honaker'' was [[bareboat charter]]ed by the {{USSB}} for the new [[Pacific<U+2013>South Africa Line]],<ref group=Note>In sources the service was referred to as both the Pacific<U+2013>South Africa Line and the South African Dispatch Line.</ref> an around-the-world venture under the management of [[J.

See, for example: {{cite news | title = Shipping and mails | work = The New York Times | date = 25 March 1929 | page = 51 }}</ref> it was discovered that she had cracks in her engine mountings and her [[cylinder head]]. ''West Honaker'' made her way to San Francisco, where parts had to be fabricated for the $100,000 repair that kept her out of service until March 1930.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B. | title = New cargo line gets bad start | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 1 December 1929 | page = A12 }}</ref>

''West Honaker'' departed on her long-delayed maiden voyage for the Pacific<U+2013>South Africa Line in mid March,<ref>{{cite news | last = Cave | first = Wayne B. | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 11 March 1930 | page = 8 }}</ref> and began a second voyage for the line in late October.<ref>{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 22 October 1930 | page = A12 }}</ref> ''West Honaker''{{'}}s service continued uneventfully until early 1932. On 2 March of that year, ''West Honaker'' collided with steamer ''Ernest H. Meyer'' in a [[snowstorm]] on the lower [[Columbia River]], near [[Astoria, Oregon]]. Both ships suffered damage, but neither needed assistance to reach [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Marine casualties | work = [[The Times]] | date = 3 March 1932 | page<U+00A0>= 23 }}</ref> ''West Honaker'' had just finished undergoing general repairs in drydock in Portland prior to the collision, which caused about $30,000 in damages.<ref>{{cite news | title = News of ships and sailings at Pacific ports | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 7 March 1932 | page = A9 }}</ref> The {{USSB}} filed suit against the Portland Steamship Company for the cost of repairs, which were completed by mid March.<ref>{{cite news | title = News of ships and sailings at Pacific ports | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 19 March 1932 | page = 7 }}</ref>

In mid-June, the bareboat charters of the three {{USSB}} vessels still sailing for Pacific<U+2013>South Africa<U+2014>''West Honaker'', ''West Cusseta'', and ''Crown City''<U+2014>were cancelled. At the end of each ship's voyage in progress, the ships were returned to the {{USSB}}. At the time of the announcement, ''West Honaker'' was in South African waters. The ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that preferential [[tariff]]s for British-flagged ships for lumber from [[British Columbia]]<U+2014>a major cargo carried by the line<U+2014>were responsible for the termination.<ref>{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 14 June 1932 | page = 11 }}</ref> It's not known when ''West Honaker'' completed her final trip, but in late June she was still shown in South Africa by a notice in ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Shipping and mails | work = The New York Times | date = 25 June 1932 | page = 29 }}</ref> After this mention, ''West Honaker'' disappears from contemporary news accounts.

In June 1940, the {{USMC|first=long}} opened of bidding for the reconditioning of ten laid up cargo ships, including ''West Honaker''.<ref name=NYT-laid_up /> According to the ''Los Angeles Times'', the {{USMC}}, a successor to the {{USSB}}, was forced to act because of a "critical shortage" of U.S. Navy [[auxiliary ship]]s.<ref>{{cite news | last = Drake | first = Waldo | title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor | work = Los Angeles Times | date = 5 June 1940 | page = A13 }}</ref> The [[Maryland Drydock Company]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] was the low bidder for ''West Honaker'', offering to recondition her for $77,777.<ref>{{cite news | title = Maritime Commission contracts | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | date = 11 June 1940 | page = 2 }}</ref>

On 3 November, with her reconditioning complete, ''West Honaker'' sailed from New York. After transiting the [[Panama Canal]] a week after her departure, she headed for [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]], where she arrived on 13 December. After then calling at [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]], and [[Adelaide]] through 8 January 1941, ''West Honaker'' called at Melbourne and Sydney before departing for the United States on 18 January.<ref name=CPDB>{{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: West Honaker | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=WEST+HONAKER~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | date =  | accessdate = 2008-09-16 }}</ref> Loaded with a cargo of wool intended for uniforms, blankets, and overcoats for the military,<ref>{{cite news | title = Raw wool imports flood hub; defense demand a big factor | work = The Christian Science Monitor | date = 15 February 1941 | page = 12 }}</ref> ''West Honaker'' arrived at [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], on 3 March.<ref name=CPDB />

From late March to mid August, ''West Honaker'' made another, almost identical Australian circuit, adding a stop in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] to her Australian itinerary. Almost immediately after her return to Boston, she began a third trip to Australia. After she arrived in Brisbane on 29 October, she made stops in Sydney and Melbourne. From Sydney she made a round trip to [[Noum<U+00E9>a]], [[New Caledonia]], and sailed from there to [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], where she arrived on 11 December, four days after the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] that propelled the United States into [[World War II]].<ref name=CPDB />

''West Honaker'' departed Wellington on 13 December and arrived at Boston on 28 February. From Boston, she sailed to New York via [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. After sailing from New York on 29 April, ''West Honaker'' experienced some sort of problem that necessitated her salvage. She arrived in Baltimore under tow on 4 June. After spending almost three weeks in that port, she headed for [[Cape Town]] via [[Trinidad]]. She departed Cape Town on 24 August and sailed to [[Bushire]], [[Abadan]], [[Bandar Abbas]], and [[Colombo]] over the next three months. After making a round trip to [[Calcutta]] from late November to late December, ''West Honaker'' arrived at Wellington on 26 January, sailing for New York via the [[Panama Canal]] three days later.<ref name=CPDB />

''West Honaker'' took on a load of grain and then proceeded in convoy from Boston to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] in early May, and on to [[Belfast Lough]].<ref>{{cite AHCD | convoytype = SC | convoynumber = 130 | accessdate = 2008-09-16 }}</ref> After making a circuit to [[Avonmouth]] and [[Milford Haven]], ''West Honaker'' sailed from Belfast Lough for New York on 25 June.

''West Honaker'' sailed 28 November from New York for [[Nuevitas, Cuba]], and returning via [[Key  West, Florida]], in late December. Sailing again for the [[Caribbean]] on 6 February, she visited [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] and [[Antilla]] before her 28 February 1944 return to New York. At some point within the next month, ''West Honaker'' arrived at Boston.<ref name=CPDB />
