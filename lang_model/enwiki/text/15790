'''Charles David (Charlie) Haas Jr.''' (born  on [[March 27]], [[1972]]), is an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] currently wrestling on the ''[[WWE RAW|RAW]]'' brand of [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) as one half of the [[The World's Greatest Tag Team|World's Greatest Tag Team]] with [[Shelton Benjamin]].  He was an academic and wrestling [[All-American]] at [[Seton Hall University]].

==Career==
===World Wrestling Entertainment===
After working in [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA) and [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW), Haas debuted in the WWE on the [[December 26]], [[2002]] episode of [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|''SmackDown!'']] as a heel along with [[Shelton Benjamin]] as "Team Angle". The tag team was the "contingency plan" of [[Paul Heyman]], and were intended to help [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] [[Kurt Angle]] retain his title, attacking [[Chris Benoit]] and [[Brock Lesnar]] in an attempt to weaken them. Angle eventually fired Team Angle after he [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] during that time and they began to question his leadership. The duo then became the "[[The World's Greatest Tag Team|(Self-Proclaimed) World's Greatest Tag-Team]]". The team won the [[WWE Tag Team Championship]] on two occasions before being separated when Benjamin was moved from ''SmackDown!'' to [[WWE RAW|''RAW'']] in the 2004 [[WWE draft]].

With Benjamin gone, Haas turned face and teamed up with [[Rico Constantino|Rico]] and his [[manager (professional wrestling)|valet]] [[Jackie Gayda|Miss Jackie]] to win the tag team titles once again. The team became a dominating force, with the strait-laced Haas clashing with the campy, charismatic Rico. After Rico was released, Haas struck out on his own again, accompanied by Miss Jackie. Haas would come out the loser in a match against [[Matt Wiese|Luther Reigns]] at the [[The Great American Bash #2004|''The Great American Bash 2004'']].

Haas was later involved in an [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]] in which he was in a love triangle with Miss Jackie (acknowledged on air as his fianc<U+00E9>e) and [[Dawn Marie Psaltis|Dawn Marie]]. The story culminated when Haas served as the referee in a match at [[WWE Armageddon#2004|''Armageddon 2004'']] between the two women. After the match, Haas left both women (for [[kayfabe]] purposes; his off-screen relationship with Miss Jackie continued). Then he formed a tag team with [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]]. They had limited success on ''SmackDown!'', including a feud with [[MNM]] for the WWE Tag Team Championships, but never won the titles.

====Release====
On [[July 6]], [[2005]], Haas was released by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] along with his wife, [[Jackie Gayda]]. He returned to [[Jersey All Pro Wrestling]] that same month, and began a feud for the [[JAPW Heavyweight Championship]], [[Jay Lethal]]. On [[September 10]] at ''JAPW Haas of Pain'', Lethal defeated Haas to retain his title.  

He won the [[Natural Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Ballpark Brawl#Ballpark Brawl V - BANG! BANG! Have a nice day!|''Ballpark Brawl V'']] on [[August 13]], [[2005]], defeating then-champion [[Christopher Daniels]] and [[Chris Sabin]]. He successfully defended the title the next night at [[Ballpark Brawl#Ballpark Brawl VI - Rochester Rumble|''Ballpark Brawl VI'']] against [[Harry Smith (wrestler)|Harry Smith]] with [[Mick Foley]] as a referee. He was stripped of this title when he returned to WWE, and has thus far been the only man to successfully defend the title. 

During this time, Haas also competed in the 2006 [[East Coast Wrestling Association|ECWA]] [[Super 8 Tournament]], getting into the finals but then losing to [[Davey Richards]].

===World Wrestling Entertainment===
In late [[December 2005]] Charlie Haas re-signed with WWE, returning to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling|OVW]] on [[February 22]], [[2006]]. He returned to WWE television on the [[April 17]], [[2006]] episode of ''RAW'' as [[Rob Van Dam]]'s handpicked opponent for his former partner, Shelton Benjamin. Haas defeated Benjamin in the ensuing match.

Haas would continue to wrestle on the lower midcard spot, often competing on [[WWE HEAT|''HEAT'']] as well as ''RAW'' sometimes.

On the [[June 5]], [[2006]] edition of RAW, Charlie Haas inadvertently knocked [[Lilian Garcia]] off the ring apron as he was entering the ring. It was announced on WWE.com that as a result, Lilian suffered a [[Sprain|sprained]] wrist. It was reported that he received no heat over this as everyone understood it was an accident (it should be noted that the injury was not a [[professional wrestling slang|work]]). The result was a feud with Lilian's storyline love interest [[Nelson Frazier, Jr.|Viscera]], and Haas's second heel run of his career in the WWE. Haas would make advances towards Lilian, at one point forcefully kissing her and then dropping her to the ground. Haas and Viscera continued to fight for Lilian's affection in the ring, until Lilian stated to the both of them that she wants to be "just friends." Haas gave Viscera an eye rake in anger, and a blinded Viscera accidentally gave Lilian a [[Professional wrestling throws#Samoan Drop|Samoan drop]]. Though it was unintentional, when both Charlie and Viscera had seen what had happened to their now former love interest, they simply had a laugh about it. After that, Viscera and Charlie became a tag team, usually found competing on WWE.com's ''HEAT'' in random matches until splitting in [[December 2006]]. After Shelton Benjamin won a match against [[Super Crazy]] on the [[December 4]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'', Haas came out to celebrate his win with a bewildered Benjamin. Haas and Benjamin announced the return of the World's Greatest Tag Team on the [[December 11]], [[2006]] edition of ''RAW'' and they defeated [[The Highlanders]] in their return match and beating [[The Hardys]] the next week in a 3 on 2 handicap match with [[Johnny Nitro]] as a tag team partener.
