'''Freedom of information in Canada''' describes the capacity for the [[Canadian Government]] to provide timely and accurate access to internal data concerning government services. 
Each province and territory in Canada has its own access to [[freedom of information legislation]].

==History==
By 1982, twelve countries, including the France, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the U.S. (1966), had enacted modern ATI legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2004.11-politics-canada-access-to-information-act/|title=A Love Affair with Secrecy|accessdate=18 January 2010}}</ref> Canada's [[Access to Information Act]] came into force in 1983, under the [[Pierre Trudeau]] government.

In 1987, the [[Solicitor General]] tabled a unanimous report to Parliament, ''Open and Shut: Enhancing the Right to Know and the Right to Privacy''  which contained over 100 recommendations for amending the ATI and privacy acts.

In 1998, the government would append a clause to the Access Act, making it a federal offence to destroy, falsify, or conceal public documents.

In August 2000, the Ministry of Justice and the president of the Treasury Board launched a task force to review the Access Act. The committee<U+2019>s report, delivered in June 2002, found <U+201C>a crisis in information management<U+201D> within government.

[[Universit<U+00E9> de Moncton]] professor [[Donald Savoie]]<U+2019>s 2003 book, ''Breaking the Bargain'', argues that in Canada there is a reluctance to put anything in writing, including e-mail, that might find its way into public discourse.

In the fall of 2003, [[John Bryden]], attempted to initiate a comprehensive overhaul of the Act through a [[private members bill]], [http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/3/parlbus/chambus/house/bills/private/C-462/C-462_1/C-462_cover-E.html Bill C-462], which died on the Order Paper with the dissolution of the 37th Parliament in May 2004. A similar bill was introduced by NDP MP [[Pat Martin]] on 7 October 2004 as [http://www.parl.gc.ca/38/1/parlbus/chambus/house/bills/private/C-201/C-201_1/C-201_cover-E.html Bill C-201].

In April 2005, the Justice Minister [[Irwin Cotler]] introduced a discussion paper entitled ''A Comprehensive Framework for Access to Information Reform''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0555-e.html|title= THE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT AND RECENT PROPOSALS FOR REFORM|accessdate=18 January 2010}}</ref>

On April 1, 2008, the [[Stephen Harper]] government shut down [[CAIRS]], the access to information database.<ref name="cbc">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/02/cairs.html|publisher=[[CBC.ca|CBC News Online]]|title=Tories kill access to information database|accessdate=2008-05-10|date=2008-05-02}}</ref>explained this decision as a result of CAIRS being "deemed expensive, [and] deemed to slow down the access to information."<ref name="globe">{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080505.wqp_foi0505/BNStory/National/home?cid=al_gam_mostview|publisher=''[[Globe and Mail]]''|title=Harper defends database shutdown|date=2008-05-05|accessdate=2008-05-10}}</ref> 
In response, [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[St<U+00E9>phane Dion]] described Harper's government as "the most secretive government in the history of our country."<ref name="globe"/>

On September 2008, a 393 page report sponsored by several Canadian newspaper groups, compared Canada<U+2019>s Access to Information Act to the FOI laws of the provinces and of 68 other nations titled: [http://www3.telus.net/index100/foi Fallen Behind: Canada<U+2019>s Access to Information Act in the World Context].

In 2009, [[The Walrus (magazine)]] published a [http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country detailed history of FOI in Canada].

==Federal==
In [[Canada]], the '''[[Access to Information Act]]''' allows citizens to demand records from federal bodies. The act came into force in 1983, under the [[Pierre Trudeau]] government, permitting Canadians to retrieve information from government files, establishing what information could be accessed, mandating timelines for response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walrusmagazine.com/articles/2010.01-national-affairs-the-dark-country/2/#|title=The Dark Country|accessdate=18 January 2010}}</ref> This is enforced by the [[Information Commissioner of Canada]]. 

There is also a complementary '''[[Privacy Act]]''', introduced in 1983. The purpose of the Privacy Act is to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the [[privacy]] of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a federal government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information. It is a [[Crown copyright]]. Complaints for possible violations of the Act may be reported to the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]].

Canadian access to information laws distinguish between access to records generally and access to records that contain [[personal information]] about the person making the request. Subject to exceptions, individuals have a right of access to records that contain their own personal information under the [[Privacy Act]] but the general public does not have a right of access to records that contain personal information about others under the [[Access to Information Act]].  

From 1989 to 2008, requests made to the federal government were catalogued in the [[Coordination of Access to Information Requests System]].

[[Government 2.0]] is an attempt to provide more effective processes for delivering [[Freedom of information in Canada]], to individuals and businesses. Integration of tools such as [[wiki]]s, development of government-specific social networking sites and the use of blogs, RSS feeds and [[Google Maps]] are all helping governments provide information to people in a manner that is more immediately useful to the people concerned.<ref>[http://www.collaborationproject.org/download/attachments/11206698/EPA+Web+2.0+White+Paper.pdf Environmental Protection Agency Web 2.0 Whitepaper]</ref>

A number of efforts have been made to expose data gathered by Canadian governments of all levels in ways that make it available for [[Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)|mashups]]. 
A collection of uses of social media in Canadian government can be found [http://government20bestpractices.pbworks.com/Canada here].

There have been several [http://changecamp.ca/ ChangeCamps] in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver, with organizers coming together in Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, drawing many politicians.

The [http://laccarling.ca/ Lac Carling Congress] annually brings together professionals from all three levels of government in Canada with private sector companies. The event focuses on the advancement of electronic delivery of government services in Canada.
