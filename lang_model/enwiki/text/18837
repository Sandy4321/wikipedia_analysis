'''Boudica''' (also spelled '''Boudicca''', formerly better known as '''Boadicea''') (d. 60/61) was a [[Queen regnant|queen]] of the [[Brythonic]] [[Celt]]ic [[Iceni]] people of [[Norfolk]] in Eastern [[Roman Britain|Britain]] who led a major uprising of the tribes against the occupying forces of the [[Roman Empire]]. 

Her husband, [[Prasutagus]], the Icenian king, who had ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome, had left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the [[Roman Emperor]] in his will, but when he died his will was ignored, possibly because the Romans, unlike the Britons, did not recognise daughters as heirs. The kingdom was annexed as if conquered, Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped, and Roman financiers called in their loans.

In 60 or 61, while the Roman governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign on the island of [[Anglesey]] in north [[Wales]], Boudica led the Iceni, along with the [[Trinovantes]] and others, in revolt. They destroyed [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]), formerly the capital of the Trinovantes but now a ''[[colonia]]'' (a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers) and the site of a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]], built and maintained at local expense, and routed a Roman legion, the [[Legio IX Hispana|IX ''Hispana'']], sent to relieve the settlement.

On hearing the news, Suetonius hurried to [[Londinium]] ([[London]]), the twenty-year-old commercial settlement which was the rebels' next target, but concluding he did not have the numbers to defend it, evacuated and abandoned it. It was burnt to the ground, as was [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]). An estimated 70,000-80,000 people were killed in the three cities. Suetonius, meanwhile, regrouped his forces in the [[West Midlands]], and despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated Boudica in the [[Battle of Watling Street]]. The crisis had led the emperor [[Nero]] to consider withdrawing Roman forces from the island, but Suetonius's victory secured Roman control of the province.

The chronicles of these events, as recorded by the historians [[Tacitus]]<ref>[[Tacitus]], ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#14|14-16]]; ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+14.29 14:29-39]</ref> and [[Cassius Dio]],<ref>[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/62*.html#1 62:1-12]</ref> were rediscovered during the [[Renaissance]] and led to a resurgence of Boudica's legendary fame during the [[Victorian era]], when [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was portrayed as her "namesake". Boudica has since remained an important cultural symbol in the United Kingdom.

==History==
===Boudica's name===
Until the late 20th century, Boudica was known as Boadicea, which is probably derived from a mistranscription when a manuscript of Tacitus was copied in the [[Middle Ages]]. Her name takes many forms in various manuscripts &ndash; ''Boadicea'' and ''Boudicea'' in Tacitus; ''<U+0392><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B1>'', ''<U+0392><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B1>'', and ''<U+0392><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B1>'' in Dio &ndash; but was almost certainly originally ''Boudicca'' or ''Boudica'', derived from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] word ''*bouda'', victory (proto-celtic ''*boud<U+012B>ko'' "victorious") (cf. [[Irish language|Irish]] ''bua'', ''Buaidheach'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''buddug''). The name is attested in inscriptions as "Boudica" in [[Lusitania]], "Boudiga" in [[Bordeaux]] and "Bodicca" in Britain.<ref>Graham Webster, ''Boudica: The British Revolt against Rome AD 60'', 1978; [[Guy de la B<U+00E9>doy<U+00E8>re]], [http://www.romanbritain.freeserve.co.uk/Legions.htm ''The Roman Army in Britain''], retrieved [[5 July]] [[2005]]</ref>

Based on later development of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] concludes that the correct spelling of the name is ''Boudica'', pronounced /{{IPA|b<U+0252><U+028A><U+02C8>di<U+02D0>ka:}}/, although it is mispronounced by many as /{{IPA|<U+02C8>bu<U+02D0>d<U+026A>k<U+0259>}}/.<ref>[[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]], "Queen Boudicca?", ''Britannia'' 10, 1979</ref>

===Background===
Tacitus and Dio agree that Boudica was of royal descent. Dio says that she was "possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women", that she was tall, had long red hair down to her hips, a harsh voice and a piercing glare, and habitually wore a large golden necklace (perhaps a [[torc]]), a many-coloured tunic and a thick cloak fastened by a brooch.

[[Image:EnglandNorfolk.png|thumb|right|150px|Location of modern Norfolk, once inhabited by the Iceni.]]
Her husband, [[Prasutagus]], was the king of [[Iceni]], who inhabited roughly what is now [[Norfolk]]. They were initially not part of the territory under direct Roman control, having voluntarily allied themselves to Rome following [[Claudius]]'s [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest]] of 43. They were protective of their independence and had revolted in 47 when the then-[[Roman governors of Britain|governor]], [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]], threatened to disarm them.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+12.31 12:31-32]</ref> Prasutagus lived a long life of conspicuous wealth, and, hoping to preserve his line, made the [[Roman emperor]] co-heir to his kingdom along with his two daughters.

It was normal Roman practice to allow allied kingdoms their independence only for the lifetime of their [[client king]], who would agree to leave his kingdom to Rome in his will: the provinces of [[Bithynia]]<ref>[[H. H. Scullard]], ''From the Gracchi to Nero'', 1982, p. 90</ref> and [[Galatia]],<ref>John Morris, ''Londinium: London in the Roman Empire'', 1982, pp. 107-108</ref> for example, were incorporated into the Empire in just this way. [[Roman law]] also allowed [[inheritance]] only through the male line. So when Prasutagus died his attempts to preserve his line were ignored and his kingdom was annexed as if it had been conquered. Lands and property were confiscated and nobles treated like slaves. According to [[Tacitus]], Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped. Dio Cassius says that Roman financiers, including [[Seneca the Younger]], chose this point to call in their loans. Tacitus does not mention this, but does single out the [[procurator]], [[Catus Decianus]], for criticism for his "avarice". Prasutagus, it seems, had lived well on borrowed Roman money, and on his death his subjects had become liable for the debt.

===Boudica's uprising===

In 60 or 61, while the current governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign against the island of Mona (modern [[Anglesey]]) in north [[Wales]], which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the [[druid]]s, the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt. Boudica was chosen as their leader. According to Tacitus, they drew inspiration from the example of [[Arminius]], the prince of the [[Cherusci]] who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their own ancestors who had driven [[Julius Caesar]] from Britain.<ref>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#15|15]]</ref> Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of [[divination]], releasing a [[hare]] from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction it ran, and invoked [[Andraste]], a British goddess of victory. It is perhaps significant that Boudica's own name means "victory" (see [[Boudica#Boudica's name|above]]).

[[Image:Emperor Claudius.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A statue of Emperor Claudius]]
The rebels' first target was [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]), the former Trinovantian capital and now a Roman ''[[colonia]]''. The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals, and a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]] had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment. Its inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator, Catus Decianus, but he sent only two hundred [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]]. Boudica's army fell on the poorly defended city and destroyed it, besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell. The future governor [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]], then commanding the [[Legio IX Hispana|Legio IX ''Hispana'']], attempted to relieve the city, but his forces were routed. His infantry was wiped out: only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped. Catus Decianus fled to [[Gaul]].

When news of the rebellion reached him, Suetonius hurried along [[Watling Street]] through hostile territory to [[History of London#Roman London|Londinium]] ([[London]]). Londinium was a relatively new town, founded after the conquest of 43, but had grown to be a thriving commercial centre with a population of travellers, traders, and probably Roman officials. Suetonius considered giving battle there, but considering his lack of numbers and chastened by Petillius's defeat, decided to sacrifice the city to save the province. Londinium was abandoned to the rebels, who burnt it down, slaughtering anyone who had not evacuated with Suetonius. [[Archaeology]] shows a thick red layer of burnt debris covering coins and pottery dating before 60 within the bounds of the Roman city.<ref>George Patrick Welch, ''Britannia: The Roman Conquest & Occupation of Britain'', 1963, p. 107</ref>  [[Verulamium]] ([[St Albans]]) was next to be destroyed.

In the three cities destroyed, between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed. Tacitus says the Britons had no interest in taking or selling prisoners, only in slaughter by gibbet, fire or cross. Dio's account gives more prurient detail: that the noblest women were impaled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths, "to the accompaniment of sacrifices, banquets, and wanton behaviour" in sacred places, particularly the groves of Andraste.

===Romans rally===
{{see also|Battle of Watling Street}}
Suetonius regrouped with the [[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV ''Gemina'']], some ''vexillationes'' (detachments) of the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX ''Valeria Victrix'']], and any available auxiliaries. The [[prefect]] of [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']], [[Poenius Postumus]], ignored the call, but nonetheless the governor was able to call on almost ten thousand men. He took a stand at an unidentified location, probably in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] somewhere along the [[Roman road]] now known as [[Watling Street]], in a [[defile]] with a wood behind him. But his men were heavily outnumbered. Dio says that, even if they were lined up one deep, they would not have extended the length of Boudica's line: by now the rebel forces numbered 230,000. 

Boudica exhorted her troops from her chariot, her daughters beside her. Tacitus gives her a short speech in which she presents herself not as an aristocrat avenging her lost wealth, but as an ordinary person, avenging her lost freedom, her battered body and the abused chastity of her daughters. Their cause was just, and the gods were on their side; the one legion that had dared to face them had been destroyed. She, a woman, was resolved to win or die; if the men wanted to live in slavery, that was their choice.

However, the unmaneuverability of the British forces, combined with lack of open-field tactics to command these numbers, put them at a disadvantage to the Romans, who were skilled at open combat due to their superior equipment and discipline, and the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could only put forth as many troops as the Romans could at a given time. First, the Romans stood their ground and used waves of [[pilum|javelins]] to kill thousands of [[Britons]] who were rushing toward the Roman lines. The Roman soldiers, who had now used up their javelins, were then able to engage Boudica's second wave in the open. As the Romans advanced in a [[Flying wedge|wedge]] formation, the Britons attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered.<ref>This is not the first instance of this tactic. The women of the [[Cimbri]], in the [[Battle of Vercellae]] against [[Gaius Marius]], were stationed in a line of wagons and acted as a last line of defence ([[Florus]], ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[Wikisource:Epitome of Roman History/Book 1#38|1.38]]); [[Ariovistus]] of the [[Suebi]] is reported to have done the same thing in his battle against [[Julius Caesar]] (Caesar, ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[Wikisource:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book1#51|1.51]]).</ref> Tacitus reports that "according to one report almost eighty thousand Britons fell" compared with only four hundred Romans. According to Tacitus, Boudica poisoned herself; Dio says she fell sick and died, and was given a lavish burial.

Postumus, on hearing of the Roman victory, fell on his sword. [[Catus Decianus]], who had fled to Gaul, was replaced by [[Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus]]. Suetonius conducted punitive operations, but criticism by Classicianus led to an investigation headed by [[Nero]]'s [[freedman]] [[Polyclitus (freedman)|Polyclitus]]. Suetonius was removed as governor, replaced by the more conciliatory [[Publius Petronius Turpilianus]]. The historian [[Suetonius|Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus]] tells us the crisis had almost persuaded Nero to abandon Britain.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''Nero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#18 18], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#39 39-40]</ref>

===Location of her defeat===
The location of Boudica's defeat is unknown. Most historians favour a site in the West Midlands, somewhere along the Roman road now known as [[Watling Street]]. Kevin K. Carroll suggests a site close to [[High Cross, Leicestershire|High Cross]] in [[Leicestershire]], on the junction of Watling Street and the [[Fosse Way]], which would have allowed the [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']], based at [[Exeter]], to rendezvous with the rest of Suetonius's forces.<ref>Kevin K. Carroll, "The Date of Boudicca's Revolt", ''Britannia'' 10, 1979</ref> [[Manduessedum]] ([[Mancetter]]), near the modern day town of [[Atherstone]] in [[Warwickshire]], has also been suggested.<ref>[[Sheppard Frere]], ''Britannia: A History of Roman Britain'', 1987, p. 73</ref> More recently a new discovery of Roman artifacts in [[Kings Norton]] close to [[Birmingham military history|Metchley Camp]] has suggested another possibility.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/5016126.stm Is Boudicca buried in Birmingham?], BBC, 25 May 2006, retrieved 9 September 2006</ref>

===Historical sources===
Tacitus, the most important Roman historian of this period, took a particular interest in Britain as [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], his father-in-law and the subject of his first book, served there three times. Agricola was a military [[tribune]] under Suetonius Paulinus, which almost certainly gave Tacitus an eyewitness source for Boudica's revolt.

Cassius Dio's account is only known from an [[epitome]], and his sources are uncertain. He is generally agreed to have based his account on that of Tacitus, but he simplifies the sequence of events and adds details, such as the calling in of loans, that Tacitus does not mention.

It is possible that [[Gildas]], in his 6th century polemic ''[[De Excidio Britanniae]]'', alludes to Boudica in his typically oblique fashion as a "treacherous lioness", although his general lack of knowledge about the real history of the Roman conquest of Britain makes this far from certain.<ref>[[Gildas]], [[Wikisource:The Ruin of Britain#6|''The Ruin of Britain'' 6]]; Fabio P. Barbieri, [http://www.geocities.com/vortigernstudies/fabio/contents.htm ''History of Britain, 407-597''], [http://www.geocities.com/vortigernstudies/fabio/book1.2.htm Book 1, Chapter 2], 2002 (retrieved [[5 July]] [[2005]])</ref>

==Cultural impact==
===History and literature===
By the [[Middle Ages]] Boudica was forgotten. She makes no appearance in [[Bede]], the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' or [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]''. But the rediscovery of the works of Tacitus during the ''[[Renaissance]]'' allowed [[Polydore Virgil]] to reintroduce her into British history as "Voadicea" in 1534.<ref>''Polydore Vergil's English History'' Book 2 ([http://books.google.co.uk/books?vid=OCLC04693319&id=hSAIAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA59&lpg=RA2-PA59&dq=cassivellaunus&as_brr=1#PRA2-PA69,M1 pp. 69-72]).</ref> Raphael Holinshed also included her story in his ''Chronicles'' (1577), based on Tacitus and Dio,<ref>[[Raphael Holinshed]], ''Chronicles'': History of England [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16536/16536-h/16536-h.htm#page494 4.9-13]</ref> and inspired [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] younger contemporaries [[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] to write a play, ''Bonduca'', in 1610.<ref>[[Francis Beaumont]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], ''[http://www.bibliomania.com/0/6/1/1975/frameset.html Bonduca]''</ref> [[William Cowper]] wrote a popular poem, ''Boadicea, an ode'', in 1782.<ref>[[William Cowper]], ''[http://www.bartleby.com/41/320.html Boadicea, an ode]''</ref>

It was in the [[Victorian era]] that Boudica's fame took on legendary proportions as [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] was seen to be Boudica's "namesake". Victoria's [[Poet Laureate]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], wrote a poem, ''Boadicea'',<ref>[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], ''[http://oldpoetry.com/opoem/8721-Alfred-Lord-Tennyson-Boadicea Boadicea]''</ref> and ships were named [[HMS Boadicea|after her]]. A great bronze statue of Boudica in her war [[chariot]] (furnished with [[scythed chariot|scythes]] after [[Persian Empire|Persian]] fashion), together with her daughters, was commissioned by [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]] and executed by [[Thomas Thornycroft]]. It was completed in 1905 and stands next to [[Westminster Bridge]] and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]], with the following lines from Cowper's poem, referring to the British Empire:

:Regions Caesar never knew<br>Thy posterity shall sway.

Ironically, the great anti-imperialist rebel was now identified with the head of the [[British Empire]].<ref>Graham Webster, ''Boudica: The British Revolt against Rome AD 60'', 1978</ref>

===Fiction===
Boudica's story is the subject of several novels:
*Mary Mackie 'The People of the Horse' (W H Allen 1987, ISBN 0-491-03307-9)

*The [[Harry Turtledove]] novel, ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'', features a world where the [[Spanish Armada]] succeeded in taking over England. Ten years after the fact, Shakespeare is recruited by a band of rebels to write a play that would stir the English to rebel against Spain. The subject of the play is Boudica.
*In [[Alice Borchardt]]'s ''Tales of Guinevere'' series, [[Guinevere]] is a direct descendent, on her mother's side, of Boudica.

===Films and television===
====Fictionalisations====
Boudica has been the subject of two feature films, 1928's ''Boadicea'', starring [[Phyllis Nielson-Terry]], and 2003's ''Boudica'' (''Warrior Queen'' in the USA), a UK [[television|TV]] film written by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] and starring [[Alex Kingston]] as Boudica. A new film is planned for release in 2008 entitled ''[[Warrior (2006 film)|Warrior]]'', written by [[Brian Klugman]] and [[Lee Sternthal]], directed by [[Gavin O'Connor]], and produced by [[Mel Gibson]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018713/ ''Boadicea'' (1928)], [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338806/ ''Boudica'' (2003)], and [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409457/ ''Warrior'' (2008)] at [http://www.imdb.com/ imdb.com]</ref> A British TV series, ''[[Warrior Queen]]'', was made by [[Thames Television]] in 1978 starring [[Sian Phillips]] as Boudica and [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Catus Decianus.

Boudica was a character in an episode of the third season of ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'', called ''The Deliverer'', where she was played by [[Jennifer Ward-Lealand]]. 

====Documentaries====
Boudica and her revolt have been the subject of numerous documentaries, including:
*''[[Warrior Women]]'' episode 5, [[Discovery Channel]], hosted by [[Lucy Lawless]]
*''[[History Bites]]'': "Xena's Evil Sister". 
*''[[Warrior Queen Boudica]]'' (2006), [[History International|History International Channel]]
*''[[Battlefield Britain]]'' (2004) BBC

====Other references====
She was mentioned during the ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episode "Bloodbath". In the BBC sitcom ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', the first name of the main character, Geraldine Granger, is at one stage said to be Boadicea ([[The Vicar of Dibley#Geraldine Granger|Geraldine is her middle name]]).

In the 1980s children's television show ''[[Alvin and the Chipmunks (TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]]'' there is a character called Boudikat, who appears in the episode "Romancing Miss Stone" from the third season. Boudikat is an aggressive feline creature, who constantly gets in the way of David Seville's attempts to Romance Miss Stone, with hilarious consequences. According to [[Roland Rivron]], a leading expert on 80's cartoons, the Boudikat and thus Boudica were the inspiration <!---not only---> for the legendary [[ThunderCats]] <!---but also the jovial [[Bagpuss]] - anachronism, Bagpuss is from the 70s--->.

===Comics===
The ''[[Sl<U+00E1>ine (comics)|Sl<U+00E1>ine]]'' series in the British comic ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' included two runs, entitled "Demon Killer" and "Queen of Witches" (1993-1994), written by [[Pat Mills]] and illustrated by [[Glenn Fabry]] and [[Dermot Power]], which featured a free interpretation of Boudica's story.

The 1990s comic book series ''[[Witchblade]]'' saw Boudicca as one of the original wielders of the Witchblade.

In the 1990s, [[DC Comics]]' [[Green Lantern Corps]] included a member named Boodikka, portrayed as a fierce female warrior.

In [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]]'s graphic novel ''[[From Hell]]'', [[William Gull]] considers Boudica's defeat as the final defeat of female power by patriarchy.

===Music===
The Irish singer/songwriter [[Enya]] produced a song called "Boadicea" on her 1992 album ''[[The Celts]]''. This track was first sampled by [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]] as the intro to his 1993 release ''[[The World Is Yours (album)|The World is Yours]]''. Later, it was most famously sampled by the rap group [[The Fugees]] for their single "Ready or Not" (from 1996's ''[[The Score (album)|The Score]]''), and most recently by [[Mario Winans]] (featuring [[Puff Daddy|Sean "P. Diddy" Combs]]) on his song "I Don't Wanna Know" (2004). The track was also used in the [[soundtrack]] of the film ''[[Sleepwalkers]]''.

The famous Netherlandian soprano singer/songwriter [[Petra Berger]] produced an[other] song called "Boadicea" (written by G.Romita) on her 2001 album [["Eternal Woman"]]. 

Scottish singer/songwriter [[Steve McDonald]] composed a biographical song called "Boadicea" on his 1997 album ''Stone of Destiny'', detailing her life and tragic death.<ref>[http://www.daire.org/fanlistings/mcdonald/destiny.html ''Stone of Destiny'' lyrics from Official Steve McDonald Fanlisting]</ref> 

British rock band [[The Libertines]] refer to "Queen Boadicea" in their song "The Good Old Days", indicating a belief that her spirit still lives on in Britons today.<ref>[http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/The-Libertines/The-Good-Old-Days.html The Libertines, "The Good Old Days" lyrics]</ref> 

The British metal band [[Bal-Sagoth]] have written a song entitled "Blood Slakes the Sand at the Circus Maximus" (found on the band's album ''Battle Magic'') which features an Iceni Warrior of Boudica's uprising being captured and brought back to Rome. Her name (always spelled "Boudicca") returns in the song "When Rides the Scion of the Storms" of the same album.<ref>[http://balsagoth-lyrics.wonderlyrics.com/Blood-Slakes-The-Sand-At-The-Circus-Maximus.html Bal-Sagoth, "Blood Slakes the Sand at the Circus Maximus" lyrics], [http://balsagoth-lyrics.wonderlyrics.com/When-Rides-The-Scion-Of-The-Storms.html "When Rides the Scion of the Storms lyrics]</ref>

[[Faith and the Muse]] produced a song, "Boudiccea" for their most recent album, ''Burning Season''. The song suggests that Boudiccea may have committed suicide by falling on her sword.<ref>[http://www.mercyground.com/disc/burningseason.html#Boudiccea ''Boudiccea'' lyrics from the Faith and the Muse Site]</ref>

The Song, "Boadicea" appears on the album "Eternal Women", which is a compilation of songs to 11 famous women by Dutch Singer, Petra Berger.

===Other cultural references===
There have been scattered reports that the restless spirit of Boudica has been seen in the county of [[Lincolnshire]]. These reports, dating back to the mid-19th century, claim Boudica rides her chariot, heading for some unknown destination, and many a traveller and motorist have claimed to have seen her. There has been some debate as to how long this has been going on. Some say that the queen's restless spirit has been appearing since her death, while other suggest that the revival of interest in Boudica's story in the 19th century might have summoned her spirit back to our world. As with all reports of ghostly activity, it is up to the individual to decide whether they are true or not.<ref>Dan Asfar, ''Haunted Highways:  Ghost Stories and Strange Tales'', 2003</ref>

In the ''[[Ghosts of Albion]]'' series of web animations and books, created by [[Amber Benson]] and [[Christopher Golden]], Boudica (called Bodicea in this instance) is represented as a ghost defender of Albion.

In 2005 Boudicca and the Belgic revolt was added to the board game [[Britannia (board game)|Britannia]] after twenty years, having been omitted from the original edition.  The Boudica spelling had been suggested during development, but traditionalism prevailed.

In 2006, [[Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines]] announced their newest ship, entering service in early 2006, would be named ''Boudicca''.

Indian queen [[Rani Lakshmibai]] is sometimes referred to as the Boudica of India.

Book 9 in Tom Clancy's [[Net Force Explorers]] series, ''Private Lives'', features a character named Bodicea, who claims that her mother named her after the legendary queen.

In Greg Weisman's ''[[Gargoyles]]'' franchise, Boudicca is the name of a gargoyle beast that is part of the [[Avalon Clan]].
