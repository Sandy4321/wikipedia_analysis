It operates scheduled services and inclusive tour charters from most Italian cities to destinations in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].

== History ==

The airline was established on [[26 May]] [[1989]] and started operations on [[26 February]] [[1990]]. It was set up with a 45% shareholding by [[Alitalia]] in response to the needs of the flag carrier to develop the leisure travel market. The original shareholding was divided between [[Alitalia]] (45%), [[Olivetti]] (45%) and [[San Paolo Finance]] (10%). There have been several changes of ownership since.<ref name="FI"/>. As of 2008, Eurofly is partly owned by [[Meridiana]]

Long-haul operations started in 1998 and in 2000 Alitalia acquired full control. In 2003 the company was privatised with 80% being sold to the [[Banca Profilo Spinnaker]] fund, which bought the remaining shares in July [[2004]]. In the same year Eurofly set-up a base in [[Sharm el Sheikh]] with two [[Airbus A320|Airbus A320-200]] aircraft operating charter flights between there and several airports in Italy. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

In January 2008, EuroFly appeared in the news related to the civil war in Kenya. Two groups of 40 Italian tourists each (80 total) was refused boarding at Mombasa airport in Kenya, although they were in possession of regular return tickets. Eurofly said that the reason was the lack of payment on the part of the tour operator. Tourists, on their part, accused Eurofly of having sold their seats, at a premium price, to other travelers wanting to leave the country quickly because of the ongoing civil war (from [http://www.repubblica.it/2008/01/sezioni/esteri/kenya-bloccati/kenya-bloccati/kenya-bloccati.html la Repubblica], Jan 6, 2008).
