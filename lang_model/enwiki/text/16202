'''Tsui Po Ko''' ({{zh-c|c=<U+5F90><U+6B65><U+9AD8>}})  ([[17 May]] [[1970]] <U+2014> [[17 March]] [[2006]]) was a police constable in the [[Hong Kong Police Force]] who was implicated in a number of spectacular crimes, which included bank robbery and murder.

He died when he and another police constable shot each other in a gun battle in a Tsim Sha Tsui underpass. The inquest into the events leading up to his death aroused great interest in Hong Kong, as it unravelled a string of intriguing events, and revealed the secret life of a policeman with a delusional state of mind<ref>[http://nationmultimedia.com/worldhotnews/read.php?newsid=30032575 Hong Kong nears end of lurid murder case (''AFP'')], [[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]], April 2007, Retrieved [[2007-07-07]]</ref>. 

On [[April 2007 in Hong Kong|25 April, 2007]], the five-person jury in the Coroner's court unanimously decided that Tsui was responsible for killing two fellow police officers and a bank security guard on three separate occasions. The jury returned a verdict that he had been "lawfully killed" by fellow officer Tsang Kwok-hang in a shootout.<ref>AFP story, [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/272479/1/.html Hong Kong policeman blamed for killings], [[Channel News Asia]], April 25, 2007</ref> The inquest lasted 36 days, one of the longest ever of inquests in Hong Kong. 

Assistant Police Commissioner John Lee said that this was "an exceptional case".<ref name=rogue/> Coroner Michael Chan Pik-kiu called "the most difficult" inquest for a jury he had ever encountered.<ref name="grand jury">Una So, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=43074&sid=13309463&con_type=1&d_str=20070426&sear_year=2007 Tsui killed two officers and guard, jury finds], The Standard, April 26, 2007</ref>

==Biography==
Tsui was the elder of two children born in [[Fujian]], and arrived in Hong Kong in 1978 with his mother. His father and brother arrived a year later. He attended the Kwun Tong Government Industrial Secondary School (now Kwun Tong Kung Lok Government Secondary School). After graduation, had had several jobs, including a spell with the [[Royal Hong Kong Regiment (The Volunteers)|Hong Kong Regiment]]. 

Tsui joined the Hong Kong Police in 1993, and regarded it as well paid job with good benefits, and was a police constable for 13 years until his death in 2006.[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/world/hong-kong-devil-cop-kills-colleagues/2007/04/25/1177459784882.html] He was an outstanding cadet at the Hong Kong Police College, having won the "''silver whistle''"<ref name="no return">Una So, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=41944&sid=13026282&con_type=1&d_str=20070407&sear_year=2007 Slain officer's path of no return], The Standard, April 07, 2007</ref>. 

Tsui was an excellent marksman. In 1993, he scored full marks in target shooting as well as simulated bank robbery shooting. From 2001 to 2005, in the tests held three times a year, he would score a faultless 48 points. According to shooting range records, he been trained to shoot left-handed. He had once claimed to a superior that he was ambidextrous<ref>[http://www.singtaonet.com:82/hongkong/200703/t20070327_499928.html "Ambidextrous marksman Tsui played the markets with proxy address"], [[Sing Tao Daily]]<U+FF0C>March 27, 2007 {{zh icon}}</ref>.

His stubbornness and difficulty in communication meant that he was never promoted<ref name="no return"/>. However, since 1999, he had given up applying for promotion. From then on until 2003<U+FF0C>Tsui applied three times to join the Airport Security Unit, but failed. He failed a personality assessment during the first attempt, and subsequently failed because of insufficient fitness. Between 2002 and 2005, he was attached to the [[Tsing Yi]] district. 

Tsui's wife, Lee Po-ling, works at the Social Welfare Department as a social security assistant. The couple met when she worked as a sales assistant at the airport, and Tsui was also stationed there. They married in 1997 and they had a daughter in 2000<ref>Una So, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=42460&sid=13178727&con_type=1&d_str=20070418&sear_year=2007 Wife knew nothing of Tsui's dark side], [[The Standard]], April 18, 2007</ref>.

In October 2001, Tsui and his wife appeared together in a couples version of "[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]] on [[Asia Television Limited|ATV]] and won HK$60,000.<ref>[http://the-sun.on.cc/channels/news/20060321/20060321021337_0000_2.html '"Millionaire" couple wins 60k who said will donate to charity kills 2 months later'], [[The Sun (Hong Kong)|The Sun]]<U+FF0C>March 21, 2006</ref> 

Tsui, who was an avid sportsman, was an [[Oxfam Trailwalker]], participated in marathons, and also liked [[hang gliding]].

===First murder===
Tsui was found responsible for [[murder|murdering]] constable Leung Shing-yan ({{zh-c|c=<U+6881><U+6210><U+6069>}}) and stealing his [[revolver]] in [[March 2001]]<ref name="grand jury"/>. The 23 year old Leung, who was single, had been in the force for 5 years<ref name=lured>Matthew Lee and Eddie Luk,  [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=8135&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20010315&sear_year=2001 Officer 'lured to his death'], The Standard, March 15, 2001</ref>.

Answering a noise complaint in [[Tsuen Wan]], on March 14, 2001<ref name=lured/>, Leung was shot five times at close range. Leung took three bullets in the head and two in the back at 552 Shek To House Block B in Shek Wai Kok Estate<ref name="no return"/>. His revolver, a fully-loaded [[.38 S&W|.38]] calibre [[Smith & Wesson]] revolver, and one extra clip of six bullets were missing<ref name=lured/>.

The noise complaint was apparently bogus, and was made from an untraceable mobile phone. The police suspected that the officer was lured to the scene for his gun<ref name=lured/>. Some 3,000 people, of which 2,000 police officers, were interviewed by the police, yet the perpetrator escaped detection<ref name=eluded>[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=14704&sid=7149594&con_type=1&d_str=20060321&sear_year=2006 Tsui eluded suspicion in Leung case], The Standard, March 21, 2006</ref>. Later, [[Forensic biology|forensic tests]] found that the [[DNA]] on a mask left at the [[crime scene]] matched Tsui's.<ref>Government pathologist Pang Chi-ming gave the probability of another person with matching DNA as 1:1.4 billion. [http://hk.news.yahoo.com/070403/12/24y78.html "DNA match to Tsui on mask found in Shek To House shooting"][[Ming Pao]] April 4<U+FF0C>2007 {{zh icon}}</ref>

===Bank robbery===
On December 5, 2001, Tsui planned and executed the armed [[bank robbery]] of a [[Hang Seng Bank]] branch at Belvedere Garden in Tsuen Wan, in which [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]500,000 was stolen, and a Pakistani security guard was killed<ref name="no return"/>. 

At 12.10 pm, a masked robber acting alone burst into the bank and shot security guard.<ref name=octopus/> Zafar Iqbal Khan, aged 31, was shot three times by the robber, and died instantly. The perpetrator was a man with short hair and about 1.8m tall, which Assistant Police Commissioner Yam described as a "calm, cold-blooded and brutal robber". A HK$2 million reward was issued<ref>Eddie Luk, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&art_id=13735&sid=&con_type=1&d_str=20011212&sear_year=2001 $2m reward for bank killer info], The Standard, December 12, 2001</ref>. 

Tsui matched the description of the perpetrator as captured on [[closed circuit television]]; key pieces of evidence were a red T-shirt, [[Mizuno]] brand shoes<ref name="no return"/> and the fact that footage showed the killer to be a left-handed gunman. He was placed near to the scene by the Police: Tsui boarded a bus from Yut Tung Estate in [[Tung Chung]] at 11.11 am using the [[Octopus card]] issued to his wife; it was clocked in a [[Public light bus|minibus]] heading to Tsuen Wan at 11.53 am<ref name=octopus>Una So, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=42158&sid=13113615&con_type=1&d_str=20070413&sear_year=2007 Octopus card pieces together Tsui's movements], [[The Standard]], April 13, 2007</ref>. 

A red T-shirt carrying a similar distinctive logo as captured on CCTV was found at Tsui's home after his death. The T-shirt, bearing the logo of the Yinchuan International Motor-cycle Travel Festival was a gift to Tsui by the club secretary during his visit to the show in 2000, expert witness identified the T-shirt as having been worn inside-out during the robbery<ref>[http://hk.news.yahoo.com/070314/12/23one.html <U+300C><U+5F90><U+6B65><U+9AD8><U+795E><U+79D8><U+7D05><U+8863><U+5BE7><U+590F><U+5C0B><U+6E90> <U+4E09><U+89D2><U+6A19><U+8A8C><U+8207><U+52AB><U+532A><U+7D05><U+8863><U+76F8><U+4F3C> <U+8B66><U+5343><U+91CC><U+8FFD><U+67E5><U+300D>]<U+300A><U+660E><U+5831><U+300B><U+FF0C>2007<U+5E74>3<U+6708>15<U+65E5></ref>. [[Ballistics#Forensic ballistics|Ballistics]] identified the gun used in the robbery as having been a police service revolver taken from murdered police officer Leung Shing-yan<ref name="no return"/>.

===Financial irregularities===

An investigation by the [[CIB]] into Tsui's financial status from January 2000 to March 2006 revealed he had a total of 19 personal banking and investment accounts hidden from his wife, total assets were HK$2,977,513<ref name=assets>Una So, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=42030&sid=13078316&con_type=1&d_str=20070411&sear_year=2007 Slain cop had assets worth nearly $3m], The Standard, April 11, 2007</ref>. Seven personal and 12 investment accounts were opened under his name around mid-February in 2002, using a friend's address. Between February 2002 and October 2004, Tsui deposited HK$557,718 into the 19 accounts which could not be accounted for. All transactions were in cash<ref name=assets/>. It was reported that Tsui was active in [[foreign exchange]], [[commodities]], [[securities]], funds and [[margin (finance)|margin]] trading, and had lost a total of HK$371,982 in those investments<ref name=assets/>. 

Tsui and his wife bought one flat in August 1997, and paid HK$574,800 in cash<ref name=assets/>. Two years later, he bought a flat at Tung Chung Crescent with a HK$396,173 down payment, paying monthly instalments of HK$17,778 for a first and a second mortgage. The mortgages were paid off in just five years - HK$388,151 in 2001 and HK$500,000 in 2004<ref name=assets/>. 

The police alleged that the transactions were inconsistent with a constable's salary, and that the $500,000 unexplained cash would be consistent with the bank's loss during the heist in 2001<ref name=assets/>.

===Subway ambush===
Tsui was also responsible for ambushing two [[police officer]]s in a [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] pedestrian subway, triggering a [[shootout]] on [[17 March]], [[2006]]<ref name="grand jury"/>.

Constable Sin Ka-keung, survivor of the shoot-out, said that he and Tsang Kwok-hang were ambushed in the underpass at the junction of [[Austin Road|Austin]] and [[Canton Road|Canton]] roads. Sin had seen a man lurking on the northern stairs of the subway before he was shot in the face. The attacker then tried to snatch his revolver<ref name="no return"/>. Tsui had started the exchange. Sin returned two shots, but missed<ref name=rogue>Andrea Chiu, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=14703&sid=7146848&con_type=1 Rogue cop planned ambush, say police], The Standard, March 21, 2006</ref>. Sin grappled with the man and fired two shots before both of them slumped to the floor. Tsang was shot in the head and died, while Sin sustained gunshot wounds in the face and leg<ref name="no return"/>. Tsui was killed during the gun battle, having been shot five times in the torso by Tsang<ref name=rogue/>. 

The police confirmed that the rusty revolver found underneath Tsui's body to be the gun stolen from the late PC Leung in 2001<ref name=eluded/>.

==Mental state==
As the inquiry continued, Tsui was found to be an ambitious officer who often topped his class and did well in assessment tests. However, he was often denied promotions or opportunities to join elite units, such as the [[Airport Security Unit (Hong Kong)|Airport Security Unit]].<ref>[http://smartkids.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=4&art_id=41029&sid=12841215&con_type=1&d_str=20070327 Slain officer had major ambitions, [[The Standard]], March 27, 2007]</ref>

He was not media shy, as was demonstrated by his appearance on a television game show; he was happily photographed when he won the chance to buy his flat in a draw. He was again happy to be photographed during the democracy rally on July 1 2004 dressed in traditional Chinese funeral style ("<U+62AB><U+9EBB><U+6234><U+5B5D>")<ref>[http://the-sun.on.cc/channels/news/20060322/20060322033635_0000_3.html 'High profile participation in march as a challenge to the Government' (''Article with photo'')], [[The Sun (Hong Kong)|The Sun]]<U+FF0C>March 22, 2006, Retrieved [[2007-07-07]]</ref>.

An associate professor of social science at the [[City University of Hong Kong]] suggested that Tsui, like many criminals, did not know how to face frustration, and chose instead to take an illegal path in obtaining socially approved goals, such as money, prestige or recognition. It was suggested that the police force paid more attention to talented officers who fail to gain promotion, and recommended that there should be independent and confidential [[psychological counselling]] services for such troubled or frustrated officers.<ref name="grand jury"/>

A [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] criminal profiler believed that Tsui's behaviour fit into most of the definitions of [[Schizotypal personality disorder]], while an expert from the [[Queensland University of Technology]] said Tsui's personality profile matched that of a serial killer who believed he was destined to change the world, probably tried to rise above his self-perceived unremarkable life by playing God, by taking lives.<ref name="no return"/>
