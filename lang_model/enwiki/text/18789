"'''The Look of Love'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] from the [[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] of the 1987 film ''[[Who's That Girl (film)|Who's That Girl]]''. It was the third and final single release from the album and was released on November 25, 1987 by [[Sire Records]].  While shooting for the film, then called Slammer, Madonna had requested producer [[Patrick Leonard]] to develop a downtempo song that captured the nature of her film persona. She later added the lyrics and vocals to the demo tape developed by Leonard, and the song was "The Look of Love". Madonna was also inspired by actor [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]] in the 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''.

Featuring instrumentation from a [[percussion]], the song begins with a low [[bassline|bass synth line]] and a slow [[backing track]], followed by Madonna's expressive voice singing the lyrics. Critically appreciated as a haungting track and noted as a "gem" of the album, "The Look of Love" reached the top-ten of the charts in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. It also charted in France, Germany and Switzerland, while reaching the top-twenty of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Eurochart Hot 100 Singles]]. Madonna performed the song only once, on her [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] in 1987. During the performance Madonna pretended that she was lost on the stage, like her film character.

==Background and development==
In 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture ''[[Who's That Girl (film)|Who's That Girl]]'', known at the time as ''Slammer''. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted [[Patrick Leonard]] and [[Stephen Bray]], who had written and produced her third studio album ''[[True Blue (album)|True Blue]]'' in 1986.<ref name="fred1">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=203}}</ref> Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday, as Leonard developed the [[Chorus effect|chorus]] of the songs.<ref name="fred1"/> He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the [[melody (music)|melody]] and the lyrics of the songs, while Leonard worked on the other parts.<ref name="fred1"/> The uptempo song developed was "[[Who's That Girl (Madonna song)|Who's That Girl]]", the first single from the soundtrack, and the downtempo song, developed and written the day after, was "The Look of Love". Madonna later changed the film name to ''Who's That Girl'', rather than ''Slammer'', considering it to be a better title. Regarding the development of the songs for the film, Madonna further explained
<blockquote>
"I had some very specific ideas in mind, music that would stand on its own as well as support and enhance what was happening on screen and the only way to make that a reality was to have a hand in writing the tunes myself. [...] The songs aren't necessarily about Nikki [her character name in the movie] or written to be sung by someone like her, but there's a spirit to this music that captures both what the film and the characters are about, I think."<ref name="fred1"/>
</blockquote> 
Madonna was inspired by the look that actor [[James Stewart (actor)|James Stewart]] gave actress [[Grace Kelly]] in the 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Madonna said: "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating."<ref>{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=57}}</ref> "The Look of Love" was released as the third single from the soundtrack in the United Kingdom, some European countries and Japan. "I Know It", a track from Madonna's [[Madonna (album)|self-titled]] debut album appeared as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. In 1989, the song was used as the B-side for the "[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]" single release.<ref name="rikky">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=69}}</ref>

"The Look of Love" starts off with a low [[bassline|bass synth line]] and a slow [[backing track]]. It is followed by sound of [[percussion]] and a [[register (music)|high register]] [[note (music)|note]], contrasting with the bassline.<ref name="rikky"/> The song continues in this way uptill the last [[verse (popular music)|verse]], which is backed by the sound from an acoustic guitar.<Ref name="rikky"/> A two-part vocal is found in the line "No where to run, no place to hide". According to Rikky Rooksby, Madonna's voice sounds "expressive" when she sings the line "From the look of love" and utters the word "look" over the [[D minor]] chord present underneath. The word is sang in the second note of [[musical scale]], thus giving an impression of the [[suspension (music)|suspension]] like quality of the [[minor ninth]] chord.<Ref name="rikky"/> The song is set in the [[time signature]] of common time, with a moderate tempo of 80 [[beats per minute]]. It is composed in the key of D minor, with Madonna's voice spanning from C<sub>5</sub> to B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub>. "The Look of Love" has a basic sequence of C<U+2013>Dm<U+2013>Fm<U+2013>B as its [[chord progression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Digital Sheet Music <U+2013> Madonna Ciccone <U+2013> The Look of Love|work=''SheetMusicPlus''|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Rikky Rooksby, author of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', called the song as the album's "other gem" and denoted it as "an expressive, understated track."<Ref name="rikky"/> [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]], author of ''Madonna: An Intimate Biography'', commented that "'The Look of Love' was an exotic Madonna/Leonard ballad."<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=126}}</ref> Don Shewey from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that the song was "so haungting that it would leave you thinking as to where your life is going."<Ref>{{cite journal|last=Shewey|first=Don|date=1987-09-09|accessdate=2010-05-14|title=Madonna: Who's That Girl Soundtrack: Review|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=a-gTAQAAIAAJ&q=Madonna+The+Look+of+Love&dq=Madonna+The+Look+of+Love&cd=8|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|volume=1034|issue=45|issn=0035-791X}}</ref> John Evan Seery, author of ''Political theory for mortals: shades of justice, images of death'', commented that the song portrayed Madonna's "discipline of gaze".<ref>{{harvnb|Seery|1996|p=138}}</ref> Brian Hadden from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' found the song as depressing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hadden|first=Brian|title=Madonna Looks Back|date=2009-08-21|accessdate=2010-05-14|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|volume=92|issue=10-17|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> Tiju Francis from ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' wrote: "For a such a commonly titled song, Madonna<U+2019>s take does at least offer something a little different. [...] 'The Look of Love' actually sounds like part of the score <U+2013> Madonna could well be singing over what was previously just the moody character development background synth music apparently present in every film in the <U+2019>80s. [...]  But its slow-burn feel means the song is four minutes of not-particularly-intense brooding that never peaks <U+2013> unlike a ballad."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Tiju|title=Madonna, 112, and Blur|date=2006-05-12|volume=14|issue=5|issn=1070-4701|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=Time Publishing Ventures, Inc}}</ref>
