'''The Battle of Saragarhi''' was fought during the [[Tirah Campaign]] on 12 September 1897 between twenty one [[Sikh]]s of the 4th Battalion (then 36th Sikhs) of [[the Sikh Regiment]] of British [[India]], defending an army post, and 10,000 [[Pashtun|Afghan]] and [[Orakzai]] tribesmen in a [[last stand]]. The battle occurred in the [[North-West Frontier Province]], now a part of [[Pakistan]], which then formed part of [[British India]]. 

The contingent of the twenty-one Sikhs from the 36th Sikhs was led by [[Havildar]] Ishar Singh. They all chose to fight to the death.
Sikh military personnel and Sikh civilians commemorate the battle every year on 12 September, as '''Saragarhi Day'''.

==Situation==
Saragarhi is a small village in the border district of [[Kohat District|Kohat]], situated on the [[Samana Range]], in present day Pakistan.  On the 20th April 1894, the [[36th Sikh Regiment]] of the British Army was created, under the command of Colonel J. Cook.<ref name="pall">Pall, S.J.S. "The story of Valiant Sikhs", Amritsar, B. Chattar Singh (2004) page 98</ref>
In August 1897, five companies of the 36th Sikhs  under Lt. Col. John Haughton, were sent to the North West Frontier Providence, stationed at Samana Hills, Kurag, Sangar, Sahtop Dhar and Saraghari.

The British had partially succeeded in getting control of this volatile area, however tribal [[Pashtuns]] attacked British personnel from time to time.  Thus a series of forts, originally constructed by [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]], Ruler of the Sikh Empire, were consolidated. Two of the forts were Fort Lockhart, (on the Samana Range of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains), and Fort [[Gulistan]] ([[Sulaiman Range]]), situated a few miles apart.  Due to the forts not being visible to each other, Saragarhi was created midway, as a heliographic communication post.  The Saragarhi post, situated on a rocky ridge, consisted of a small block house with loop-holed ramparts and a signalling tower.

A general uprising by the Afghans began there in 1897, and between 27th August - 11th September, many vigorous efforts by Pashtuns to capture the Forts were thwarted by 36th Sikh regiment.  In 1897, insurgent and inimical activities had increased, and on 3rd and 9 September [[Afridi]] tribes, with allegiance to Afghans, attacked Fort Gulistan. Both the attacks were repulsed, and a relief column from Fort Lockhart, on its return trip, reinforced the signalling detachment positioned at Saragarhi, increasing its strength to one Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) and twenty troops of Other Ranks (ORs).

On September 12, 1897, 10,000 Pashtuns attacked the signalling post at Saragarhi, so that communication would be lost between the two forts.

Details of the Battle of Saraghari are considered fairly accurate, due to Gurmukh Singh signalling events to Fort Lockhart as they occurred.<ref name="pall"/>
*Around 9.00am, around 10,000 Afghans reach the signaling post at Saragarhi.
*Sardar Gurmukh Singh signals to Col. Haughton, situated in Fort Lockhart, that they are under attack.
*Colonel Haughton states he cannot send immediate help to Saragarhi.
*The soldiers decide to fight to the last to prevent the enemy reaching the forts.
*Bhagwan Singh becomes the first injured and Lal Singh was seriously wounded.
*Soldiers Lal Singh and Jiwa Singh reportedly carry the dead body of Bhagwan Singh back to the inner layer of the post.
*The enemy break a portion of the wall of the picket.
*Colonel Haughton signals that he has estimated between 10,000 and 14,000 Pashtuns attacking Saraghari. 
*The leaders of the Afghan forces reportedly make promises to the soldiers to entice them to surrender.
*Reportedly two determined attempts are made to rush the open gate, but are unsuccessful.
*Later, Fort Lockhart is breached.
*Thereafter, some of the fiercest hand-to-hand fighting occurs.  
*In an act of outstanding bravery, Ishar Singh orders his men to fall back into the inner layer, whilst he remains to fight. However, this is breached and all but one of the defending soldiers are killed, along with many of the Pashtuns.
*Gurmukh Singh, who communicated the battle with Col. Haughton, was the last Sikh defender.  He is stated to have killed 20 Afghans, the Pashtuns having to set fire to the post to kill him. As he was dying he was said to have yelled repeatedly the regimental battle-cry "Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal (He who cries God is Truth, is ever victorious).

Having destroyed Saragarhi, the Afghans turned their attention to Fort Gulistan, but they had been delayed too long, and reinforcements arrived there in the night of 13-14 September, before the fort could be conquered.<ref name="londongaz"/> The Afghans later stated that they had lost about 180 killed<ref name="ioss">Maj. Gen. Jaswant Singh [http://www.sikhstudies.org/Periodicals.asp?TtlCod=471 Letter to H.M. Queen Elizabeth II] Institute of Sikh Studies (1999)- accessed 2008-03-30</ref> and many more wounded<ref name="defending"/> during the engagement against the 21 Sikh soldiers, but some 600 bodies<ref name="sharma">Sharma, Gautam [http://books.google.com/books?id=xLrTzZd0j1kC&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&ots=bL9wvcZWUs&sig=x8L5sX4P-sc_I1N6KSG5bohRYJs#PPA185,M1 Valour and Sacrifice: Famous Regiments of the Indian Army], India, Allied Publishers (1990) ISBN 817023140X, via Google Books- accessed 2008-01-25</ref><!-- Please note that many articles, based on the same source, state that "The Afghans later admitted they had lost 4,800 men during the engagement." The 4800 deaths were not exclusive to Battle of Saragarhi, but the entire campaign --> are said to have been seen around the ruined post when the relief party arrived (however, the fort had been retaken, on 14 September, by the use of intensive artillery fire,<ref>"The Frontier War," ''Daily News'', London (16 Sep 1897)</ref> which may have caused many casualties). The total casualties in the entire campaign, including the Battle of Saragarhi, numbered at around 4,800.

== Reception==
===British parliament===
When the gallantry of Saragarhi was recounted to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], the recitation drew a [[standing ovation]] from the members. The saga of Saragarhi was also brought to the notice of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].

{{cquote|"The British, as well as the Indians, are proud of the 36th Sikh Regiments.  It is no exaggeration to record that the armies which possess the valiant Sikhs cannot face defeat in war" - [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]<ref name="pall"/>}}

{{cquote|"You are never disappointed when you are with the Sikhs.  Those 21 soldiers all fought to the death. That bravery should be within all of us. Those soldiers were lauded in Britain and their pride went throughout the Indian Army. Inside every Sikh should be this pride and courage. The important thing is that you must not get too big-headed it is important to be humble in victory and to pay respect to the other side." - [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Field Marshal William Joseph Slim, 1st Viscount Slim]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bsingh.dsl.pipex.com/khalsa/iwm2001.htm|publisher=''[http://www.bsingh.dsl.pipex.com/index.html Sikh Spirit]''|title=The Epic Battle of Saragarhi|author=The Sikh Spirit|date=2001-11-01

{{cquote|"The Government of India have caused this tablet to be erected to the memory of the twenty one non-commissioned officers and men of the 36 Sikh Regiment of the Bengal Infantry whose names are engraved below as a perpetual record of the heroism shown by these gallant soldiers who died at their posts in the defence of the fort of Saragarhi, on the 12 September 1897, fighting against overwhelming numbers, thus proving their loyalty and devotion to their sovereign, the Queen Empress of India, and gloriously maintaining the reputation of the Sikhs for unflinching courage on the field of battle."|30px|30px|}}

=== Order of Merit ===
All the 21 Sikh non-commissioned officers and soldiers of other ranks who laid down their lives in the Battle of Saragarhi were posthumously awarded the [[Indian Order of Merit]], the highest gallantry award of that time, which an Indian soldier could receive by the hands of the [[British monarchy|British crown]], the corresponding gallantry award being [[Victoria Cross]]. This award is equivalent to today's [[Param Vir Chakra]] awarded by the [[President of India]]. 

The names of the 21 recipients of the gallantry award are:

==Remembrance and legacy==

Numerous sources state<!-- original UNESCO source needed --> that the battle of Saraghari is included in one of the "eight collective stories of bravery", as published by UNESCO<!-- when was this published? who authored it? where is the original UNESCO source? -->, which includes the heroic [[Battle of Thermopylae]].<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-sikh.htm  Sikh Regiment]</ref><ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060925/mailbag.htm The Tribune, Chandigarh, India - Mailbag<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://mod.nic.in/samachar/march01-03/html/nd.htm Chap<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19990525/ige25006.html A century later, Punjab resurrects some of its bravest men]</ref>.  The battle has become [[Cultural icon|iconic]] of [[Eastern culture|eastern military civilization]], British empire military history and Sikh history.<ref name="ashes">Singh, Kanwaljit & Ahluwalia, H.S. ''Saragarhi Battalion: Ashes to Glory'', India, Lancer International (1987) ISBN 8170620228</ref> The modern Sikh Regiment continues to celebrate the day of the Battle of Saragarhi each 12 September as the '''Regimental Battle Honours Day'''. To commemorate the men the British built two '''Saragarhi [[Gurudwara]]s''': one in [[Amritsar]] very close to the main entrance of the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], and another in [[Ferozepur Cantonment]], which was the district that most of the men hailed from.

===In Indian Schools===
The [[Indian military]], in particular the [[Indian Army]] have been pushing for the battle to be taught in India's schools. They want it taught due to the [[heroism]] shown by the Indian soldiers to acts as inspiration for young children <U+2013> in the field of [[bravery]]. There were articles like these, printed in the Punjab's longest-established newspaper, ''The Tribune'' in 1999: "the military action at Saragarhi is taught to students the world over and particularly to students in France."<ref>Robin Gupta [http://www.tribuneindia.com/1999/99mar20/saturday/head2.htm An epic performance: A slice of history] Chandigarh, ''The Tribune'' (20 March 1999)- accessed 2008-04-19</ref> Although there seems to be no evidence for this claim (it is not, for example, on France's national school curriculum<ref>[http://eduscol.education.fr/ French Education Ministry website]- accessed 2008-04-19</ref>) the news was enough to provoke political debate, and the battle has been taught in schools in the Punjab since 2000:

{{cquote|The decision to include the battle story in the school curriculum was taken last year during a public rally presided over by the Punjab Chief Minister, Mr Parkash Singh Badal. Following this, the State Government had issued a notification that the battle story should be included in the school curriculum from this session. There had been a constant demand from the Sikh Regiment and various ex-servicemen<U+2019>s associations that the battle be included in the school curriculum. A similar request had also been put forward to Mr Badal during the battle<U+2019>s state-level centenary celebrations at Ferozepore in 1997. A subsequent letter sent to the Punjab Government by the Saraghari Memorial and Ethos Promotion Forum had also urged the State Government that the battle has many inspiring lessons for children. On hearing the acts of valour, the British Parliament had then risen in unison to pay homage to the fallen soldiers. The unique battle is also taught in schools of France and figures as one of the eight collective stories on bravery published by the UNESCO.<ref name="trib3">{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000405/cth1.htm|publisher=''[http://www.tribuneindia.com The Tribune]''|title=Recounting battle of Saragarhi|author=Vijay Mohan|date=2000-04-05|accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>}}

===Saragarhi and Thermopylae===

The battle has frequently been compared to the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]<ref name="ashes"/>, where a small [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] force faced a large [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army of [[Xerxes]] ''(480 BC)''.  

It is important to note that during the Battle of Saraghari, the British did not manage to get a relief unit there until after the 21 had fought to their deaths. At Thermopylae, the 300 Spartans also stayed after their lines had been breached, to fight to their deaths.
