'''''Il pastor fido''''' ('''''The Faithfull Shepherd''''' in [[Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet|Richard Fanshawe]]'s translation) is a pastoral [[tragicomedy]] set in [[Arcadia]] by [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]].    One of the most famous plays of the 17th century, it appeared in over a hundred editions following its first publication in Venice in 1590.   The first known performances took place at [[Ferrara]] (1595 or 96) and at [[Mantua]] (1598).

It inspired numerous [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]] composers, including [[Giaches de Wert]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Sigismondo d'India]], [[Alessandro Grandi]], [[Tarquinio Merula]], and [[Heinrich Sch<U+00FC>tz]]; [[Philippe de Monte]] named a volume after the play.   The first operatic treatment was Handel's [[Il pastor fido (Handel)|HWV 8]] in 1712.

The ''Il pastor fido'' sonatas for [[Musette de cour]] or flute published as Vivaldi's opus 13 are in fact by [[Nicolas Ch<U+00E9>deville]].
