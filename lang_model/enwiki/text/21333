The '''Natchez Massacre''' was a surprise revolt against [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] in the area of modern [[Natchez, Mississippi]], by [[Natchez people|Natchez Indians]] on November 29,&nbsp;1729. The Natchez had lived alongside the French for more than a decade prior to the incident, conducting peaceful trade and labor and even marrying some of the colonists. However, the Natchez leaders were provoked when the French colonial commandant, Sieur de Ch<U+00E9>part, demanded land from a Natchez village for his own plantation near [[Fort Rosalie]]. More than 240 people were killed in the subsequent revolt, most of them French men, and the fort was left in ruins.

The massacre destroyed some of the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana colony]]'s most productive farms, and endangered shipments of food and trade goods on the [[Mississippi River]]. As a result, the [[Early modern France#France in the 17th and 18th centuries|French state]] withdrew management of Louisiana from the [[French West India Company]] and returned it to crown control in 1731. The governor of the colony, [[<U+00C9>tienne P<U+00E9>rier (governor)|<U+00C9>tienne P<U+00E9>rier]], was recalled to [[France]] in 1732.

==Background==
[[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] had established a fort and trading post at [[Natchez, Mississippi]], by 1717, and then built a number of large plantations or concessions, as well as smaller farms, on land acquired from the [[Natchez people]]. Relations with the tribe were generally friendly, and a few French men even married and had children with Natchez women. In 1722 and 1723, however, brief armed conflicts erupted, which were settled through negotiations between [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] [[List of colonial governors of Louisiana|governor]] [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville|Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]] and Natchez war chief Serpent Piqu<U+00E9>. Tensions resurfaced when the new commandant, Ch<U+00E9>part, demanded land in the center of a Natchez village; the natives were reluctant to move the gravesite of their ancestors.<ref>Barnett, pp. 80<U+2013>95</ref><ref>Le Page du Pratz, pp. 230<U+2013>231</ref>

Historical controversy surrounding the Natchez Massacre concerns the question of whether the Natchez plotted with other major tribes of the region to plan a simultaneous attack on the French. The historian Kathleen duVal, for example, writes that the massacre was the result of a widespread conspiracy, even though the [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]] and the Tioux were the only other tribes to actually attack the French.<ref>{{cite book

P<U+00E9>rier claimed that even the [[Choctaw]] nation, which had been a close ally of the French, was part of the plot, and that a conference with the Choctaw planned in [[New Orleans]] for the first two days of December was to be the occasion for an attack.<ref>Sayre, pp. 232<U+2013>234</ref> However, Jean-Baptiste De Laye, a militia commander in the French retaliations following the massacre, wrote in an unpublished narrative that P<U+00E9>rier's claims were groundless, and that the Tioux, Yazoo, and other nations were not complicit and had no foreknowledge of the attack.<ref>De Laye, p. 62</ref>

[[Dumont de Montigny|Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois-Benjamin Dumont de Montigny]] and [[Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz]], the leading 18th-century historians of the Natchez, drew on information collected from French women taken captive during the massacre, both writing that the Natchez had conspired with other nations, but then attacked a few days earlier than the date agreed upon. They described a system of bundles of sticks used as tokens to count the number of days remaining until the strike.<ref name="eal">{{cite journal|last=Sayre|first=Gordon|title=Plotting the Natchez Massacre: Le Page du Pratz, Dumont de Montigny, Chateaubriand|journal=Early American Literature|year=2002|volume=37|issue=3|pages=381<U+2013>413}}</ref> The undetected destruction of a couple of the sticks derailed the count, although the reason for the lost sticks differed in each historian's account. Because the Natchez attacked two days earlier than the date agreed upon with the other nations, the other nations called off their participation, and the existence of the conspiracy remained conjectural.<ref>''M<U+00E9>moires historiques sur la Louisiane'', pp. 134<U+2013>138</ref><ref>Le Page du Pratz, p. 250</ref><ref>Sayre, p. 237</ref> P<U+00E9>rier, in his reports to superiors in [[France]], may have exaggerated the scale of the attack, suggesting that many more tribes were involved in the conspiracy, in order to defend his leadership as governor. P<U+00E9>rier implied that the results of the massacre could have been worse if not for his prompt action.<ref>Sayre, p. 245</ref>

==Attack==
[[File:Fort Rosalie site.jpg|upright|thumb|250px|alt=Grass and a few trees on flat ground, with the Mississippi River in the background|The fort was located on the banks of the Mississippi River.]]
The Natchez prepared for their strike by borrowing firearms from some French colonists, with promises to go hunting and to share the game with the guns' owners.<ref>''The Memoir of Lieutenant Dumont'', p. 230</ref> In the days prior to the massacre, some French men and women had heard rumors of a revolt, but the commandant, Ch<U+00E9>part, disregarded them and even placed in irons some of the men who voiced the warnings.<ref>''M<U+00E9>moires historiques sur la Louisiane'', pp. 143<U+2013>150</ref> Then, on the morning of November&nbsp;29, 1729, Natchez Indians mounted a surprise attack on [[Fort Rosalie]], as well as on farms and concessions in the area now covered by the city of Natchez, killing about 240 people, all of them French and most of them men.<ref>Conrad, pp. 131<U+2013>140</ref>

The Natchez generally spared women, children, and African slaves. Among the captives was Marie Baron Roussin <U+2014> widow of Jean Roussin <U+2014> who in 1731 married Dumont de Montigny. More than 20 years later, Dumont de Montigny published one of the key histories of the revolt.<ref>''The Memoir of Lieutenant Dumont'', p. 240</ref>

News of the Fort Rosalie attack reached New Orleans in early December, and the colonists there began to panic. Governor P<U+00E9>rier reacted to the massacre by forbidding the entry of a delegation of Choctaw Indians into the city, for fear that they were using the pretext of a friendly visit to launch an attack.<ref>''The Memoir of Lieutenant Dumont'', pp. 238, 250</ref> He then ordered African slaves and French troops to massacre a small village of Chaouachas Indians downstream from the city, whose occupants had played no part in the uprising in Natchez. His superiors in Paris reprimanded the leader for this act, which may have been designed to prevent any alliance between slaves and Native Americans against the French colonists.<ref>Galloway, pp. 45<U+2013>52</ref> P<U+00E9>rier was ordered back to France in 1732 and soon replaced by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, a previous governor of Louisiana whom the French state believed was more experienced at dealing with the Native Americans of the region.<ref>Balvay, p. 176</ref>

A more serious retaliation against the Natchez began late in December and in January 1730, with expeditions led by Jean-Paul Le Sueur and by Henri de Loubeoy.<ref>Giraud, pp. 410<U+2013>415</ref><ref>''M<U+00E9>moires historiques sur la Louisiane'', pp. 183<U+2013>191</ref> The two commanders besieged the Natchez in forts built near the site of the [[Grand Village of the Natchez]], a mile or so east of Fort Rosalie. The French relied on allied support from the Choctaw, but were dismayed to learn that the Choctaw demanded ransom payments for the French women and African slaves they recaptured. In late February 1730, the Natchez left the two forts and escaped across the Mississippi River.<ref>De Laye, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> They hid in the [[bayou]]s along the Black River, where a subsequent expedition led by P<U+00E9>rier in 1731 attempted to dislodge them.<ref>Le Page du Pratz, pp. 291<U+2013>303</ref> Throughout the 1730s, the French organized several expeditions to attack Natchez who had taken refuge among the Chickasaw in northern Mississippi, and to the west near the post at [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]].<ref>Vitry, pp. 23<U+2013>59</ref>

==Legacy==
The Natchez massacre was depicted in the 1827 novel ''Les Natchez'' by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Ren<U+00E9> de Chateaubriand]].<ref>Balvay, pp. 15<U+2013>20</ref> The novel incorporated Chateaubriand's earlier best-selling novellas ''[[Atala (novella)|Atala]]'' and ''[[Ren<U+00E9> (novella)|Ren<U+00E9>]]'' into a longer narrative that greatly embellished the history of the French and the Natchez in Louisiana. For Chateaubriand, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America.<ref name="Chateaubriand">{{cite book
