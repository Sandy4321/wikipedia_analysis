==History==
The city of Maracay was officially established on March 5, 1701, by Bishop [[Diego de Ba<U+00F1>os y Sotomayor]] in the valleys of Tocopio and Tapatapa (what is known today as the central valley of Aragua) in northern Venezuela.  According to the most accepted explanation, it was named after a local indigenous chief, and refers to the "Maracayo" (''Felis mitis''), a small tiger.  Alternative etymologies cite a local aromatic tree called ''Mara''.

Maracay experienced rapid growth during [[Juan Vicente G<U+00F3>mez]]'s dictatorship (1908 - 1935).  G<U+00F3>mez saw Maracay as a suitable place to make his residence during his rule, and ordered the construction of an Arc of Triumph, a bull plaza (a near replica of the one in [[Seville]], [[Spain]]), an opera house, a zoo, and, most notably, the Hotel Jard<U+00ED>n (Garden Hotel), a majestic, tourist attraction with very large gardens.  The city is home to the Mausoleo de G<U+00F3>mez (G<U+00F3>mez's mausoleum), where the dictator's remains are stored.

==Geography==
The mountains on the north side of Maracay, that separate it from the coast, make up the [[Henri Pittier National Park]], named after the [[Swiss]] [[natural history|naturalist]] that studied them.  The park is a very lush [[rainforest]], with a great variety of [[fern]]s.  Two very winding roads cut through the park over the mountains to the coast. One, beginning at the North-Central part of the city known as Urbanizaci<U+00F3>n El Casta<U+00F1>o, goes to the beach town of [[Choroni Beach|Choron<U+00ED>]].  The other, beginning at the North-Western part of the city known as Urbanizaci<U+00F3>n El Lim<U+00F3>n, goes to Ocumare de la Costa and the beaches of Cata and Catica.

==Maracay & the Military==
Maracay is a city heavily influenced by the military. Maracay is the cradle of Venezuelan aviation, and it is home to the two largest Air Force bases in the country.
