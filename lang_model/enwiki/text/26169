'''Stefan Matthew Wever''' (born 22 April 1958) is a former professional [[baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He made his [[Major League Baseball]] debut, incidentally his only game, with the [[New York Yankees]] in {{By|1982}}, and had a 0<U+2013>1 record a 27.00 [[earned run average]] (ERA), and two [[strikeout]]s in that game.

Born in West Germany, Wever moved to the United States as a child, where he took up baseball. He played baseball in high school and the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], which led to him being drafted by the New York Yankees. After four seasons in the minor leagues, Wever made his major league debut on 17 September 1982. In his debut, he suffered a shoulder injury, which he tried to pitch through for two years before having surgery in 1984. He tried to come back from the injury in 1985, but retired. After retiring, he opened a bar in [[San Francisco]], which he continues to run.

==Early life==
Wever was born in [[Marburg]], [[West Germany]] in 1958. He immigrated to the United States with his mother and twin sister at six and lived in [[Boston]] until he was 12, when he moved to [[San Francisco]]. He attended [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]], where he played on the school's baseball team. During his senior year, Wever helped lead the Lowell Cardinals to the city championship game, and he graduated in 1976.<ref name=dream>{{cite web|last=Tannura|first=Vincent|title=Wever's dream: Former phenom with major league future finds bliss as coach of Redwood High baseball team|url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_12340122|work=[[Marin Independent Journal]]|date=May 10, 2009|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>

After graduating from high school, Wever was not looked at by college recruiters due to a lack of competition he faced.<ref name=yahoo>{{cite news|last=Dinard|first=Tom|date=January 17, 2012|title=Sunlight For A Moonlight Man|url=http://www.thepostgame.com/features/201201/sunlight-moonlight-man|website=[[ThePostGame]]|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref> As a result, he attended the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] on an academic scholarship, and [[Walk-on (sports)|walked on]] to the school's baseball team.<ref name=dream/> In three seasons with the Santa Barbara Gauchos, he had 18 wins, 17 losses, 199 [[strikeout]]s, and 15 [[complete game]]s; the losses and complete games were at that time school records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/ucsbgauchos/docs/bbrecords021810/9|title=USCB Baseball Record Book|publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]]|page=9|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref> After his junior year, Wever was drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] in the sixth round of the [[1979 Major League Baseball Draft]]. He was given a [[signing bonus]] of $16,000, and officially signed with the team shortly after the draft concluded.<ref name=yahoo/>

==Baseball career==
Wever began his professional career in 1979 with the [[Oneonta Yankees]] of the [[New York-Penn League]] (NYPL). He pitched in ten games for the team, finishing the season with a 6&ndash;3 record, a 1.77 [[earned run average]] (ERA), and 70 strikeouts.<ref name=brm>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=wever-001ste|title=Stefan Wever Minor League Statistics & History|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}</ref> In the Yankees' championship series against the [[Geneva Cubs]], he pitched a [[shutout]] and threw nine strikeouts to win the first game and help the Yankees win the NYPL Championship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Baseball Idyll|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=atECAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false|first=Joel|last=Oppenheimer|work=[[New York Magazine]]|page=68|date=October 22, 1979|issn=0028-7369}}</ref> The following year, Wever was promoted to the [[Fort Lauderdale Yankees]] of the [[Florida State League]]. That year, he had a 7&ndash;3 record, a 3.64 ERA and 94 [[innings pitched]] in 15 games.<ref name=brm/>

In 1981, Wever began the season remaining with Fort Lauderdale. He had a 7&ndash;3 record and a 2.00 ERA in 12 games before being promoted to the [[Nashville Sounds]] of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]], the Yankees' AA affiliate. With Nashville, he had a 5&ndash;2 record and 2.05 ERA in nine appearances.<ref name=brm/> Wever's pitching coach in Nashville was [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[Hoyt Wilhelm]]. Wilhelm felt he had the ability but not the confidence to pitch in the majors, and spent his time in Nashville working on that aspect of Wever's game.<ref name=yahoo/> The following season, Weber was almost unanimously named to the Southern League All-Star team, thanks to 11 wins and 116 strikeouts through the end of June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19820718&id=8KcfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WdYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6303,2729898|title=Southern stars named|work=[[The Gadsden Times]]|date=July 18, 1982|page=32}}</ref> He improved to a 16-6 record, a 2.78 ERA, and 191 strikeouts, won the Southern League Pitcher of the Year award, and accomplished the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts.<ref name=dream/> He led Nashville to the Southern League championship, and right after doing so, the Yankees called Weber up to the major leagues.<ref name=dream/>

His first and only major league appearance came against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were [[Paul Molitor]] and [[Robin Yount]], both future Hall of Famers, one of only a few players in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, he felt a twinge in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first.<ref name=yahoo/><ref name=mlb>{{cite news |last=Miller |first= Doug |date= September 12, 2005|title=A dream unfulfilled: Onetime prospect looks back at brief Major League career |url= http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050912&content_id=1206578&vkey=news_nyy&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy|website= [[MLB.com]]|publisher= [[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref> Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was taken out of the game. He pitched for 2<U+2154> innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches.<ref name=mlb/> Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation.<ref name=yahoo/> Because of continued pain in his shoulder,<ref name=yahoo/> he instead spent the season with the AAA [[Columbus Clippers]], where he went 1&ndash;4 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.<ref name=brm/>

Wever spent 1984 with Fort Lauderdale, where he went 1&ndash;3 in seven games.<ref name=brm/> After the seven games, he visited Dr. [[James Andrews (physician)|James Andrews]], who diagnosed the twinge he suffered two years earlier as a torn [[rotator cuff]] and torn labrum; it explained why he had been throwing 85 mph since the injury, compared to 95 mph beforehand. He had surgery shortly afterward, and spent the rest of the year [[wikt:rehabilitate|rehabbing]] the injury.<ref name=dream/> He attempted a comeback in 1985 with the [[Albany-Colonie Yankees]], and had a 4.91 ERA in five games with the team.<ref name=brm/> In June, having continued to pitch through shoulder pain, Wever retired from baseball and ended his professional career.<ref name=yahoo/>

==Post-playing career==
After retiring from baseball, Wever returned to school, and earned a bachelor's degree in English literature from the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=bar>{{cite news |last=La Marr |first= Chris |date= September 17, 2001 |title=PROFILE: Stefan Wever: One-time big-leaguer now longtime bar owner|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/PROFILE-Stefan-Wever-One-time-big-leaguer-now-2878713.php|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}</ref> He married Melinda in 1988, and three years later opened up the Horseshoe Tavern, a bar in San Francisco's Marina District, which he continues to run.<ref name=yahoo/><ref name=bar/>
