'''Frank Black''' (born '''Charles Michael Kittridge Thompson IV''' on [[April 6]], [[1965]]) is a contemporary [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[guitarist]].<ref name="blackname" />  Black is best known as the leader of the influential [[alternative rock]] band [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], where he performed under the [[stage name]] '''Black Francis'''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&uid=SEARCH&sql=Bbx68mpm39f5o | title=allmusic ((( Pixies > Overview ))) | accessdate=2006-10-25 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine, allmusic}}</ref><ref>When the Pixies reunited in 2004, he did not specify whether he was adopting his Black Francis pseudonym again.</ref> Following the band's breakup in 1993, he embarked on a solo career under his current pseudonym. After releasing several albums with [[4AD]], he left the label and formed a backing band, '''Frank Black and the Catholics'''. Black reformed the Pixies in 2004 and continues to release solo records whilst touring and recording with them.<ref>As of October 2006, the band are together and continue to tour.</ref><ref name="nmepixies">{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/pixies/24809 | title=Pixies to begin work on new album | accessdate=2006-10-25 | author=NME}}</ref>

Black's vocal style has varied, from a screaming, yowling vocal delivery as lead vocalist of the Pixies to a more measured melodical style in later Pixies albums and his solo career.<ref>Sisario, Ben.

==Biography==

===Youth===

Charles Thompson was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] on April 6, 1965. His father was a bar owner,<ref name="pg3" /> and Thompson first lived in [[Los Angeles, California]] as a baby because his father wanted to "learn more about the restaurant and bar business".<ref name="pg4">Frank, Ganz, 2006. p .4</ref> Thompson was introduced to music at a young age as his parents often listened to 1960s [[folk rock]],<ref name="pg3" /> and he discovered the music of [[Christian rock]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Larry Norman]] at 13.<ref name="pg4" /> Norman's music influenced Francis to the extent that he named the Pixies' first [[Extended play|EP]] (and a line in the song "Levitate Me") after one of Norman's lyrics, "[[Come on Pilgrim]]".

Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:<ref name="pg4" />

{{cquote|I wasn't hanging out at all-ages shows or trying to get into clubs to see bands, and I was buying records at used [[Record shop|records store]]s and borrowing them from the library. You just saw Emerson, Lake and Palmer records. So I didn't know [punk] music but I started to hear about it in [[high school]]. But it was probably a good thing that I didn't know it, that I instead listened to a lot of '60s records and this [[Contemporary Christian music|religious music]].}}

Thompson's family moved around, disrupting his high school education. Just before his senior year, the family moved to [[Westport, Massachusetts|Westport]], [[Massachusetts]], where he received a ''Teenager of the Year'' award (the title of a later solo album).<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 5</ref> During this time, Thompson composed several songs that appeared in his later career, including "[[Here Comes Your Man]]" from ''[[Doolittle]]'' and the song "Velvety Instrumental Version".<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 88</ref><ref>Pixies ''[[Complete 'B' Sides]]'' liner notes</ref><ref>"Velvety Instrumental Version" was later released, with lyrics, as "Velvety" on the [[Frank Black and the Catholics]]' 2002 album, ''[[Devil's Workshop]]''.</ref>

He then studied in the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], majoring in anthropology.<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:z7d2vw9va9ek~T1 | title=allmusic (((Pixies > Biography))) | accessdate=2006-10-27}}</ref>. Thompson shared a room with another roommate for a [[semester]] before sharing a room with future Pixies guitarist [[Joey Santiago]].<ref name="pg9">Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 9</ref> The two shared an interest in music, and Santiago introduced Thompson to 1970s punk and the music of [[David Bowie]]; they soon began to jam together.<ref name="officialprofile">{{cite web | url=http://www.4ad.com/pixies/profile/ | title=Pixies Profile | author=4AD | accessdate=2006-08-13}}</ref> Santiago later recalled his time in college with Thompson:<ref name="pg9" />

{{cquote|Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music. I didn't want any more distractions, but I took my guitar up and we started fooling around with it. He'd write 'em, and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar.}}

{{sample box end}}
In his second year of college, Thompson embarked on a trip to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] as part of an exchange program and spent six months in an apartment with a "weird, psycho, gay roommate", who later inspired the song "[[Crackity Jones]]".<ref>Sisario, 2006. p. 12</ref> Many of the Pixies' early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico.<ref>The influence of his trip to [[Puerto Rico]] is most notable in the song "Isla De Encanta", named after the island's [[motto]], "Isla Del Encanto".</ref> Thompson finally left his studies after debating whether he would go to [[New Zealand]] to view [[Halley's Comet]] or to start a rock band with his former roommate from Massachusetts, [[Joey Santiago]]. He soon arrived back in Boston, changing his name to "Black Francis" (a name change inspired by [[Iggy Pop]]) and forming the Pixies with Joey Santiago, recruiting bassist [[Kim Deal]] and drummer [[Dave Lovering]].<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio" />

The band released several albums, including ''[[Come On Pilgrim]]'', ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' and ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]''. The band's later albums, ''[[Bossanova]]'' and ''[[Trompe Le Monde]]'', were characterized by Francis' increasing influence on the band's output and focus on science fiction themes,<ref>Francis, Black. Lyrics. "[http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=43099 Planet of Sound]." (''[[Trompe Le Monde]]''). [[Gramophone record|LP]]. [[4AD Records|4AD]] 1991.</ref> which he later explored in his early solo work. Deal had contributed to previous albums, but from ''Bossanova'' on, all the original songs were written by Francis. The Pixies split in 1993 due primarily to internal tensions between Francis and Deal. They found modest success (primarily on [[Campus radio|college radio]]) in America and became popular throughout [[Europe]].<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio" />

===Early solo career===

[[Image:Teenager of the year cover.jpg|thumbnail|200px|''[[Teenager of the Year]]'' (1994)]]
Francis went on to record solo material with [[Eric Drew Feldman]].<ref>Eric Drew Feldman was a veteran of avant-rock bands [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]], [[Captain Beefheart]]'s Magic Band, and [[The Residents]]</ref> Santiago would also perform on his first solo tour. After adopting the stage name "Frank Black" (an inversion of his "Black Francis" persona), his first solo release was the self-titled ''[[Frank Black (album)|Frank Black]]'' (1993), which included the song "Los Angeles", about different places named [[Los Angeles (disambiguation)|Los Angeles]]. The following year, Black released ''[[Teenager of the Year]]'', which included the song "Headache", a moderate success on rock playlists.  These two albums were critically well-received and remain fan favorites, although they enjoyed little commercial success. In 1995, Black left his longtime label [[4AD]] (and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] in the US), who had released the Pixies catalog in addition to his first two solo albums.<ref name="allmusicbio">{{cite web | url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:70qag4attvoz~T1 | title=((( Frank Black > Biography ))) | accessdate=2006-10-23 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>

1996 saw the release of ''[[The Cult of Ray]]'' on [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings]]; a turn away from the elaborate, sometimes lush production of his first solo works, the album was recorded primarily live with few overdubs.  His band for this album featured sole "Teenager" holdover [[Lyle Workman]] on lead guitar along with bassist [[David McCaffrey]] and [[Scott Boutier]] on drums.<ref>Both had previously played in the [[jangle pop]] band [[Miracle Legion]].</ref> Though the album was not a critical or commercial success, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Black's working methods for the next several years.

===Frank Black and the Catholics===

Black dubbed this backing band "the Catholics", and the band's eponymous album ''[[Frank Black and the Catholics (album)|Frank Black and the Catholics]]'' was recorded in 1997. Recorded live-to-two-track initially as merely a demo, Black was so pleased with the results that he decided to release the sessions with no further production.<ref name="cathreview">{{cite web | url=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxvi/10.23.98/ae/record3.html | title=Black's first holy communion for post-Pixies fans | accessdate=2006-10-28 | author=Daniel McGarry}}</ref> The album was delayed for over a year by internal conflicts at American,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://quimby.gnus.org/html/interview/BlackFrank.article.battle.html | title=A Frank Black internet radio show!?!? | accessdate=2006-10-23 | date=1997-08-10 | author=Eric Rutherford}}</ref> and was ultimately released in late 1998 by [[SpinArt Records]] in the US.<ref>Since leaving American, Black has avoided long-term contracts with labels, and has maintained ownership of his album masters, licensing each album individually for release.</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/frankblack/ | title=Frank Black | accessdate=2006-10-26 | author=Splendid Ezine}}</ref>  The album also became the first to be posted to the [[eMusic]] service &mdash; they claim it is "the first album ever made legally available for commercial download".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emusic.com/album/10889/10889232.html | title=Hey - Live Pixies, MP3 Album Music Download at eMusic | accessdate=2006-10-28 | author=Yancey Strickler, eMusic}}</ref> Critical reception to the album was in general mixed, with some writers noting Black's seemingly deliberate turn away from the "quirkiness" of the Pixies and his early solo work for a self-consciously straightforward approach.<ref name="cathreview" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:47rn286y05oa | title=((( Frank Black and the Catholics > Overview ))) | accessdate=2006-10-23 | author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref>

[[Image:Fbbld.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Black Letter Days]] (2002)]]
Black would continue to eschew [[multi-track recording]] for the live-to-two-track technique for all subsequent releases under the group name.<ref>This method precludes the use of overdubs to correct errors or add texture; all takes are recorded continuously, and mixing is done "on the fly".</ref> On later albums, Black incorporated more musicians into the sessions to allow for more varied instrumental textures.  Explaining his rationale behind the method, Black said:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/november_2002/frank-black.html | title=Frank Black | accessdate=2006-10-23 | author=Dan Kilian}}</ref>

{{cquote|Well, it's real. It's a recording of a performance, of a real performance between a group of people, an entourage, a band, as opposed to a facsimile of that, which is frequently what people do with multi-track recording. [...] I prefer it. It's a little more real. It's got a little more heart.}}

Workman left the group in 1998 to pursue session and sideman work; Rich Gilbert was added to the group to replace him.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.frankblack.net/bio/default.asp?page=rich | title=Rich Gilbert: Guitar Phenomenalist | accessdate=2006-11-01 | author=Dean Katsiris | date=2005-12-23}}</ref> The band released ''[[Pistolero (album)|Pistolero]]'' in 1999 and then ''[[Dog in the Sand]]'', which is often considered a high-point of Black's career, in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.medianugget.com/2001/06/dog_in_the_sand.html | title=Media Nugget : Dog in the Sand : Frank Black and the Catholics | accessdate=2006-11-08 | quote=Dog in the Sand...is also one of his best.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/blackfrankandthecatholics/doginthesand | title=Frank Black & The Catholics: Dog in the Sand (2001): Reviews | accessdate=2006-11-08 | quote=Dog In The Sand' is unquestionably Frank Black's finest solo album.}}</ref> ''Dog in the Sand'' added Dave Philips on [[pedal steel guitar]] and lead guitar, and Eric Drew Feldman and Joey Santiago began making occasional appearances with the group live and on record.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/blackfrank-dog.shtml | title=Frank Black and the Catholics: Dog in the Sand | accessdate=2006-11-05 | author=Patrick Schabe, Popmatters}}</ref>

Two separate albums, ''[[Black Letter Days]]'' and ''[[Devil's Workshop]]'', were released simultaneously in 2002.  A sixth album with the Catholics, ''[[Show Me Your Tears]]'', was released in 2003.  ''Show Me Your Tears<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Thompson's recent [[divorce]] and entrance into [[psychotherapy|therapy]].<ref name="allmusicbio" />

===Pixies reunion, Nashville and beyond===

In late 2003, following long-standing rumours, an official announcement was made that Pixies were practicing for a reunion tour. They played publicly for the first time in 12 years in April [[2004]], and went on to tour extensively in the U.S, [[Canada]] and Europe in the same year. The Pixies also recorded a new composition "[[Bam Thwok]]", sung and co-written by Deal, which was released on the [[iTunes Music Store]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nme.com/news/108820.htm | title=New Pixies Song on iTunes | accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref>

2004 saw Black begin a collaboration with a group of respected [[Nashville]] session men that included [[Steve Cropper]], Spooner Oldham, [[Reggie Young]], and [[Anton Fig]], as well as producer Jon Tiven, to record ''[[Honeycomb (album)|Honeycomb]]'', released in July 2005 to generally favorable reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/blackfrank/honeycomb?q=frank%20black | title=Frank Black: Honeycomb (2005): Reviews | accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref> A second volume of Nashville sessions, a double album entitled ''[[Fastman Raiderman]]'', was released in June [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002155416 | title=Frank Black Fashions Double Album | accessdate=2006-11-18 | author=Jonathan Cohen, Billboard | date=2006-03-08}}</ref>

[[Image:Frank_Black_WF.jpg|300px|right|thumbnail|Black performing in concert in 2005 at the San Diego Street Scene Festival]]
Black appeared at a concert by Christian rock pioneer [[Larry Norman]] in June 2005 in Salem, Oregon. Norman was the writer of the song, "Six Sixty Six" which Black covered on the album ''[[Frank Black and the Catholics (album)|Frank Black and the Catholics]]''. Norman and Black did a duet on "Watch What You're Doing", which later appeared on Norman's album, ''Live at The Elsinore''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://meetjesushere.com/live_at_the_elsinore.htm | title=Live At The Elsinore | accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref>

Black continued to tour as part of the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, two separate albums of Frank Black and the Catholics [[B-side]]s and rarities, ''[[Snake Oil (album)|Snake Oil]]'' and ''[[One More Road for the Hit]]'', were released on the [[iTunes Music Store]] in March [[2006]] (with an eye towards a future CD release). On top of this, Black was also working on more new solo material with [[Eric Drew Feldman]] in the first part of 2006, some of which has already been performed live with Feldman. Black began his first solo tour since 2003 in the fall of 2006. In October 2006, Black announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007.<ref name="nmepixies" /> 

Black currently lives in [[Eugene, Oregon]] and is married to Violet Clark, his second wife, with whom he has two children, Jack and Lucy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sltrib.com/themix/ci_4133825 | title=A conversation with Frank Black | accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref>

==Musical style==

===Influences===

{{section-stub}}

===Songwriting and lyrics===

During his stay in Puerto Rico, Black picked up a fairly fluent yet informal (at times incorrect) use of [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]], which he has continued to use throughout his career. His earlier songs in Pixies reflected aspects of his days in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and are heavily seasoned with local [[slang]] from the island. Since his later works with the Pixies, the use of Spanish drifted westward, reflecting places and aspects of the state of [[California]] and its culture. Many of his songs allude to California's [[surf]] culture, although he himself has never experienced or had interest in it.

His lyrics are noted for their sometimes obscure references to unusual topics like [[outer space]], unexplained phenomena such as [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]]s, and even [[The Three Stooges]] (the last of these being the subject of "Two Reelers", a song from ''Teenager of the Year''). He has also used the [[Bible]] as a source for his stories, most notably in the [[incest]]uous tale of "[[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]]'s Son" and the stories of [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]], [[Bathsheba]] in "Dead", [[Samson]] in "Gouge Away" and [[The Tower of Babel]] in multiple songs. Lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on later Pixies records such as ''[[Bossanova]]'' and ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'', and on his three solo albums of the mid-1990s (''Frank Black'', ''Teenager of the Year'', and ''The Cult of Ray'').

With the Catholics, his lyrics have more often tended towards historical topics; for example, the song "St. Francis Dam Disaster" (from ''Dog in the Sand'') is about the catastrophic collapse of the [[St. Francis Dam]] near Los Angeles in March [[1928]], and the ''All My Ghosts'' [[EP]] featured an account of the "Humboldt County Massacre" of [[Wiyot]] Indians on [[February 26]], [[1860]] near [[Eureka, California]].

===Vocals and instrumentation===

{{section-stub}}

Black once said he modelled his performance style on two simple words: "Scream it." He adopted the [[mantra]] from a Thai neighbor, who once asked him to sing "[[Oh! Darling]]" by [[The Beatles]] (from their album ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'') and to "Scream it like you hate that bitch!"<ref>Frank, Ganz, 2006. p. 6</ref> Indeed, Black's powerful screams were a signature of Pixies albums, along with the band's typical song structure of quietly paced [[verse]]s followed by thundering [[refrain|chorus]] lines and repetitive guitar [[staccato]].<ref name="allmusicpixiesbio" />

==Legacy==

{{section-stub}}

==Television appearances and videos==

{{section-stub}}

Black has appeared on a range of television shows solo and as part of the Pixies, ranging from ''[[120 Minutes]]'' and ''[[The Late Show]]'' in the US, to ''[[The Word]]'' in the UK.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.broszkowski.com/tv/pixies/pixiesvideodownload.html | title=Download Obscure Pixies TV appearances | accessdate=2006-11-06 | author=Matthew Broszkowski}}</ref>
