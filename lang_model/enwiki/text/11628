===Early years===
[[Image:Euler-10 Swiss Franc banknote (front).jpg|thumb|Old Swiss 10 Franc banknote honoring Euler]]
Euler was born on April 15, 1707 in [[Basel]] to Paul Euler, a [[pastor]] of the [[Reformed Church]]. His mother was Marguerite Brucker, a pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters named Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena. Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the town of [[Riehen]], where Euler spent most of his childhood. Paul Euler was a friend of the [[Bernoulli family]]&mdash;[[Johann Bernoulli]], who was then regarded as Europe's foremost [[mathematician]], would eventually be the most important influence on young Leonhard.  Euler's early formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. At the age of thirteen he enrolled at the [[University of Basel]], and in 1723, received his Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. At this time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.<ref name="childhood">{{cite book |last= James |first= Ioan |title= Remarkable Mathematicians: From Euler to von Neumann |publisher= Cambridge |year= 2002|page=2 |isbn= 0-521-52094-0}}</ref> Euler was at this point studying [[theology]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at his father's urging, in order to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced Paul Euler that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician. In 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the [[Speed of sound|propagation of sound]] with the title ''De Sono''.<ref>[http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/e002tr.pdf Translation of Euler's dissertation in English by Ian Bruce]</ref>  At that time, he was pursuing an (ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to obtain a position at the University of Basel.  In 1727, he entered the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy]] Prize Problem'' competition, where the problem that year was to find the best way to place the [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s on a ship. He won second place, losing only to [[Pierre Bouguer]]&mdash;who is now known as "the father of naval architecture". Euler subsequently won this coveted annual prize twelve times in his career.<ref name="prize">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727<U+2013>1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| page = 156 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.1996.0015}}</ref>

===St. Petersburg===
Around this time Johann Bernoulli's two sons, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]] and [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli|Nicolas]], were working at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[St Petersburg]]. On July 10, 1726, Nicolas died of [[appendicitis]] after spending a year in Russia, and when Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to St Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.<ref name="stpetersburg">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727<U+2013>1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| page = 125 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.1996.0015}}</ref>

[[Image:Euler-USSR-1957-stamp.jpg|thumb|1957 stamp of the former [[Soviet Union]] commemorating the 250th birthday of Euler. The text says: 250 years from the birth of the great mathematician, academician Leonhard Euler.]]
Euler arrived in the Russian capital on 17 May 1727. He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered [[Russian language|Russian]] and settled into life in St Petersburg. He also took on an additional job as a medic in the [[Russian Navy]].<ref name="medic">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727<U+2013>1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| page = 127 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.1996.0015}}</ref>

The Academy at St. Petersburg, established by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very few students were enrolled in the academy in order to lessen the faculty's teaching burden, and the academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions.<ref name="prize">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727<U+2013>1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| page = 124 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.1996.0015}}</ref>

The Academy's benefactress, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]], who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died on the day of Euler's arrival. The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. The nobility were suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, and thus cut funding and caused other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues.

Conditions improved slightly upon the death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at St. Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department.<ref name="promotion">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727<U+2013>1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 128<U+2013>129 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.1996.0015}}</ref>

On 7 January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707<U+2013>1773), a daughter of [[Georg Gsell]], a painter from the Academy Gymnasium.<ref>{{Cite book | first1=I.R. | last1=Gekker | first2=A.A. | last2=Euler | contribution=Leonhard Euler's family and descendants | editor1-first=N.N. | editor1-last=Bogoliubov | editor2-first=G.K. | editor2-last=Mikha<U+012D>lov | editor3-first=A.P. |editor3-last=Yushkevich |editor3-link=Adolf Yushkevich|title=Euler and modern science | publisher=Mathematical Association of America | year=2007 | isbn=088385564X }}, p. 402.</ref> The young couple bought a house by the [[Neva River]].

===Berlin===
[[Image:Euler GDR stamp.jpg|thumb|left|Stamp of the former [[German Democratic Republic]] honoring Euler on the 200th anniversary of his death. In the middle, it shows his [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|polyhedral formula]] <math>V+F-E=2</math>.]]

Concerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 to take up a post at the ''[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]]'', which he had been offered by [[Frederick the Great of Prussia]].  He lived for twenty-five years in [[Berlin]], where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works which he would be most renowned for: the ''[[Introductio in analysin infinitorum]]'', a text on functions published in 1748, and the ''[[Institutiones calculi differentialis]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title = E212 -- Institutiones calculi differentialis cum eius usu in analysi finitorum ac doctrina serierum|publisher=Dartmouth|url=http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E212.html}}</ref> published in 1755 on [[differential calculus]].<ref name="Friedrich">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William | title = Euler: The Master of Us All | year = 1999| publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | pages = xxiv<U+2013>xxv| nopp = true }}</ref> In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In addition, Euler was asked to tutor the Princess of Anhalt-Dessau{{Who|date=June 2010}}, Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters to her{{When|date=June 2010}}, which were later compiled into a best-selling volume entitled ''Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess''. This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works, and it was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the 'Letters' testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.<ref name="Friedrich"/>

Despite Euler's immense contribution to the Academy's prestige, he was eventually forced to leave Berlin. This was partly because of a conflict of personality with Frederick, who came to regard Euler as unsophisticated, especially in comparison to the circle of philosophers the German king brought to the Academy. [[Voltaire]] was among those in Frederick's employ, and the Frenchman enjoyed a prominent position in the king's social circle. Euler, a simple religious man and a hard worker, was very conventional in his beliefs and tastes. He was in many ways the direct opposite of Voltaire. Euler had limited training in [[rhetoric]], and tended to debate matters that he knew little about, making him a frequent target of Voltaire's wit.<ref name="Friedrich"/> [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick]] also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities:

{{cquote|I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in [[Sanssouci]]. My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry!<ref>{{cite book | title=Letters of Voltaire and Frederick the Great, Letter H 7434, 25 January 1778 | author=[[Frederick II of Prussia]] | publisher=Brentano's | location=New York | year=1927 | others=[[Richard Aldington]] }}</ref>}}

===Eyesight deterioration===
Euler's [[eyesight]] worsened throughout his mathematical career. Three years after suffering a  near-fatal [[fever]] in 1735 he became nearly blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed his condition on the painstaking work on [[cartography]] he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy. Euler's sight in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, so much so that Frederick referred to him as "[[Cyclops]]". Euler later suffered a [[cataract]] in his good left eye, rendering him almost totally blind a few weeks after its discovery in 1766. Even so, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]]. For example, Euler could repeat the [[Aeneid]] of [[Virgil]] from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity on many areas of study actually increased. He produced on average one mathematical paper every week in the year 1775.<ref name="volumes"/>

===Return to Russia===
The situation in Russia had improved greatly since the accession to the throne of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], and in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy and spent the rest of his life in Russia. His second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage. Three years after his wife's death Euler married her half sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723<U+2013>1794).<ref>{{Cite book | first1=I.R. | last1=Gekker | first2=A.A. | last2=Euler | contribution=Leonhard Euler's family and descendants | editor1-first=N.N. | editor1-last=Bogoliubov | editor2-first=G.K. | editor2-last=Mikha<U+012D>lov | editor3-first=A.P. |editor3-last=Yushkevich | title=Euler and modern science | publisher=Mathematical Association of America | year=2007 | isbn=088385564X }}, p. 405.</ref> This marriage would last until his death.

On 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, during a conversation with [[Anders Lexell]] about the newly discovered [[Uranus]] and its [[orbit]] Euler suffered a [[brain hemorrhage]] and died few hours later.<ref name="euler">{{cite book|title=Leonhard Euler|author=A.

In the eulogy written for the French Academy by the French mathematician and philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]], he commented,

{{cquote|''<U+2026>il cessa de calculer et de vivre'' <U+2014> <U+2026> he ceased to  calculate and to live.<ref name=condorcet>{{cite web| url = http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/historica/condorcet.html| title = Eulogy of Euler - Condorcet| accessdate =30 August 2006| author =Marquis de Condorcet}}</ref>}}

He was buried next to Katharina at the [[Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery]] on [[Vasilievsky Island]]. In 1785 [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] put a marble bust of Leonhard Euler on a pedestal next to the Director's seat. In 1837 [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] put a headstone on his grave, which in 1956, for the 250th anniversary of Euler, was moved together with his remains to the necropolis of 18th century at [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]].<ref>{{Find a Grave|grid=15567379}}</ref>

==Contributions to mathematics and physics==

{{E (mathematical constant)}}

Euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics: [[geometry]], [[infinitesimal calculus]], [[trigonometry]], [[algebra]], and [[number theory]], as well as [[continuum physics]], [[lunar theory]] and other areas of [[physics]]. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 [[quarto (text)|quarto]] volumes.<ref name="volumes"/> Euler's name is associated with a [[List of topics named after Leonhard Euler|large number of topics]].

===Mathematical notation===
Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]<ref name="function"/> and was the first to write ''f''(''x'') to denote the function ''f'' applied to the argument ''x''. He also introduced the modern notation for the [[trigonometric functions]], the letter ''e'' for the base of the [[natural logarithm]] (now also known as [[Euler's number]]), the Greek letter [[Sigma|<U+03A3>]] for summations and the letter ''i'' to denote the [[imaginary unit]].<ref name=Boyer>{{cite book|title = A History of Mathematics|last= Boyer|first=Carl B.|coauthors= Uta C. Merzbach|publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn= 0-471-54397-7|pages = 439<U+2013>445|year = 1991}}</ref> The use of the Greek letter ''[[pi (letter)|<U+03C0>]]'' to denote the [[pi|ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter]] was also popularized by Euler, although it did not originate with him.<ref name="pi">{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/talks/mathml/mathml2.html| title = Mathematical Notation: Past and Future| accessdate=August 2006| last = Wolfram| first = Stephen}}</ref>

===Analysis===
The development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] was at the forefront of 18th century mathematical research, and the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]]s<U+2014>family friends of Euler<U+2014>were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of [[mathematical rigor|mathematical rigour]],<ref name = "Basel"/> his ideas led to many great advances.
Euler is well-known in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] for his frequent use and development of [[power series]], the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as

:<math>e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {x^n \over n!} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{0!} + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}\right).</math>

Notably, Euler directly proved the power series expansions for ''e'' and the [[inverse tangent]] function. (Indirect proof via the inverse power series technique was given by Newton and Leibniz between 1670 and 1680.) His daring use of power series enabled him to solve the famous [[Basel problem]] in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):<ref name="Basel">{{cite book| last = Wanner| first = Gerhard| coauthors = Harrier, Ernst | title = Analysis by its history| edition = 1st| year = 2005| month = March| publisher = Springer| page = 62}}</ref>

:<math>\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1 \over n^2} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2}\right) = \frac{\pi ^2}{6}.</math>

[[Image:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|A geometric interpretation of Euler's formula]]

Euler introduced the use of the [[exponential function]] and [[logarithms]] in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and [[complex number]]s, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms.<ref name=Boyer>{{cite book|title = A History of Mathematics|last= Boyer|first=Carl B.|coauthors= Merzbach, Uta C. |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn= 0-471-54397-7|pages = 439<U+2013>445|year = 1991}}</ref> He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers, and discovered its relation to the [[trigonometric function]]s. For any [[real number]] [[<U+03C6>]], [[Euler's formula]] states that the [[Exponential function#On the complex plane|complex exponential]] function satisfies

:<math>e^{i\varphi} = \cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi.\,</math>

A special case of the above formula is known as [[Euler's identity]],
:<math>e^{i \pi} +1 = 0 \, </math>
called "the most remarkable formula in mathematics" by [[Richard Feynman]], for its single uses of the notions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and equality, and the single uses of the important constants 0, 1, ''e'', ''i'' and <U+03C0>.<ref name="Feynman">
{{cite book |last= Feynman|first= Richard|title= The Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume I|page=10 |chapter= Chapter 22: Algebra |year=1970 |month= June}}</ref>  In 1988, readers of the ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' voted it "the Most Beautiful Mathematical Formula Ever".<ref name=MathInt/> In total, Euler was responsible for three of the top five formulae in that poll.<ref name=MathInt>{{cite journal | last= Wells | first= David | year= 1990 | title = Are these the most beautiful? | journal = Mathematical Intelligencer | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages= 37<U+2013>41 | doi= 10.1007/BF03024015 }}<br />{{cite journal | last= Wells | first= David | year= 1988 | title = Which is the most beautiful? | journal = Mathematical Intelligencer | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages= 30<U+2013>31 | doi= 10.1007/BF03023741 }}<br /> See also: {{cite web | url = http://www.maa.org/mathtourist/mathtourist_03_12_07.html | title = The Mathematical Tourist | accessdate=March  2008 | last = Peterson | first = Ivars }}</ref>

[[De Moivre's formula]] is a direct consequence of [[Euler's formula]].

In addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher [[transcendental function]]s by introducing the [[gamma function]] and introduced a new method for solving [[quartic equation]]s. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern [[complex analysis]], and invented the [[calculus of variations]] including its best-known result, the [[Euler<U+2013>Lagrange equation]].

Euler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, [[analytic number theory]]. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of [[Generalized hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], [[q-series]], [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic trigonometric functions]] and the analytic theory of [[generalized continued fraction|continued fractions]]. For example, he proved the [[infinitude of primes]] using the divergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way [[prime numbers]] are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the [[prime number theorem]].<ref name="analysis">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William| title = Euler: The Master of Us All | year = 1999| publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | chapter = 3,4 }}</ref>

=== Number theory ===
Euler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of [[Christian Goldbach]], his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy.  A lot of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the works of [[Pierre de Fermat]].  Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas, and disproved some of his conjectures.

Euler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis.  He proved that [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges]].  In doing so, he discovered the connection between the Riemann zeta function and the prime numbers; this is known as the [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function|Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function]].

Euler proved [[Newton's identities]], [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], and he made distinct contributions to [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]].  He also invented the [[totient function]] <U+03C6>(''n'') which is the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer ''n'' that are [[coprime]] to ''n''.  Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as [[Euler's theorem]].  He contributed significantly to the theory of [[perfect numbers]], which had fascinated mathematicians since [[Euclid]].  Euler also made progress toward the [[prime number theorem]], and he conjectured the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]].  The two concepts are regarded as fundamental theorems of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].<ref name="numbertheory">{{cite book| last = Dunham| first = William| title = Euler: The Master of Us All | year = 1999| publisher =The Mathematical Association of America | chapter = 1,4}}</ref>

By 1772 Euler had proved that 2<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 = [[2147483647|2,147,483,647]] is a [[Mersenne prime]]. It may have remained the [[largest known prime]] until 1867.<ref>Caldwell, Chris. [http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html ''The largest known prime by year'']</ref>

===Graph theory===
{{See also|Seven Bridges of K<U+00F6>nigsberg}}
[[Image:Konigsberg bridges.png|frame|right|Map of K<U+00F6>nigsberg in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the seven bridges, highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges.]]
In 1736, Euler solved the problem known as the [[Seven Bridges of K<U+00F6>nigsberg]].<ref name="bridge">{{cite journal| last = Alexanderson| first = Gerald| year = 2006| month = July| title = Euler and K<U+00F6>nigsberg's bridges: a historical view| journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society| doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-06-01130-X| volume = 43| page = 567}}</ref> The city of [[K<U+00F6>nigsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was set on the [[Pregel]] River, and included two large islands which were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no [[Eulerian path|Eulerian circuit]]. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]], specifically of [[planar graph]] theory.<ref name="bridge"/>

Euler also discovered the [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|formula]] ''V''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''E''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 relating the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a convex [[polyhedron]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Polyhedra|author=Peter R. Cromwell|location=Cambridge|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=189<U+2013>190}}</ref> and hence of a [[planar graph]].  The constant in this formula is now known as the [[Euler characteristic]] for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the object.<ref>{{cite book|title=Algorithmic Graph Theory|author=Alan Gibbons|location=Cambridge|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=72}}</ref> The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]<ref name="Cauchy">{{cite journal|author=Cauchy, A.L.|year=1813|title=Recherche sur les poly<U+00E8>dres<U+2014>premier m<U+00E9>moire|journal=Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique|volume= 9 (Cahier 16)|pages=66<U+2013>86}}</ref> and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier|L'Huillier]],<ref name="Lhuillier">{{cite journal|author=L'Huillier, S.-A.-J.|title=M<U+00E9>moire sur la poly<U+00E8>drom<U+00E9>trie|journal=Annales de Math<U+00E9>matiques|volume=3|year=1861|pages=169<U+2013>189}}</ref> is at the origin of [[topology]].

===Applied mathematics===
Some of Euler's greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the [[Bernoulli numbers]], [[Fourier series]], [[Venn diagrams]], [[Euler numbers]], the constants [[E (mathematical constant)|e]] and [[pi|<U+03C0>]], continued fractions and integrals. He integrated [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[differential calculus]] with Newton's [[Method of Fluxions]], and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the [[numerical approximation]] of integrals, inventing what are now known as the [[Euler approximations]]. The most notable of these approximations are [[Euler's method]] and the [[Euler<U+2013>Maclaurin formula]]. He also facilitated the use of [[differential equations]], in particular introducing the [[Euler<U+2013>Mascheroni constant]]:

:<math>\gamma = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \left( 1+ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} - \ln(n) \right).</math>

One of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in [[music]].  In 1739 he wrote the ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,'' hoping to eventually incorporate [[musical theory]] as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.<ref name="music">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727<U+2013>1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 144<U+2013>145 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.1996.0015}}</ref>

=== Physics and astronomy ===
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}
Euler helped develop the [[Euler&ndash;Bernoulli beam equation]], which became a cornerstone of engineering.  Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in [[classical mechanics]], Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems.  His work in astronomy was recognized by a number of Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career.  His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the [[solar parallax|parallax]] of the sun.  His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate [[History of longitude|longitude tables]].<ref>Youschkevitch, A P; Biography in ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'' (New York 1970<U+2013>1990).</ref>

In addition, Euler made important contributions in [[optics]].  He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory of light in the ''[[Opticks]]'', which was then the prevailing theory.  His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the [[wave theory of light]] proposed by [[Christian Huygens]] would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the [[wave-particle duality|quantum theory of light]].<ref name="optics">{{cite journal

}}</ref>

===Logic===
He is also credited with using [[closed curve]]s to illustrate [[syllogism|syllogistic]] reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as [[Euler diagram]]s.<ref name="logic">Baron, M. E.; A Note on The Historical Development of Logic Diagrams. The Mathematical Gazette: The Journal of the Mathematical Association. Vol LIII, no. 383 May 1969.</ref>

==Personal philosophy and religious beliefs==
Euler and his friend [[Daniel Bernoulli]] were opponents of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz's]] [[monadism]] and the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he went so far as to label Wolff's ideas as "heathen and atheistic".<ref name="wolff">{{cite journal| author = Calinger, Ronald  | year = 1996| title = Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727<U+2013>1741)| journal = Historia Mathematica| volume = 23| issue = 2| pages = 153<U+2013>154 | doi = 10.1006/hmat.1996.0015}}</ref>

Much of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his ''Letters to a German Princess'' and an earlier work,  ''Rettung der G<U+00F6>ttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einw<U+00FC>rfe der Freygeister'' (''Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers''). These works show that Euler was a devout [[Christian]] who believed the Bible to be inspired; the ''Rettung'' was primarily an argument for the [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration of scripture]].<ref name="theology"/>

There is a famous anecdote inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg academy. The French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for [[atheism]] were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was later informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the [[existence of God]]: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced, "Sir, <math>\frac{a+b^n}{n}=x</math>, hence God exists<U+2014>reply!". Diderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court.  Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]], given that Diderot was a capable mathematician who had published mathematical treatises.<ref name="diderot">{{cite journal| last = Brown | first = B.H.| year = 1942| month = May| title = The Euler-Diderot Anecdote| journal =The American Mathematical Monthly| volume = 49| issue = 5| pages = 302<U+2013>303| doi = 10.2307/2303096| url = http://jstor.org/stable/2303096}}; {{cite journal| last = Gillings | first = R.J.| year = 1954| month = February| title = The So-Called Euler-Diderot Incident| journal =The American Mathematical Monthly| volume = 61| issue = 2| pages = 77<U+2013>80| doi = 10.2307/2307789| url = http://jstor.org/stable/2307789}}</ref>
