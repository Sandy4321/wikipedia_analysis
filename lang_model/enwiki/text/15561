The '''1995 Sugar Bowl''' was the 62nd edition of the post-season American [[college football]] [[Sugar Bowl]] [[bowl game]]. It featured the [[1995 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech Hokies]] and the {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Texas Longhorns|title=Texas Longhorns}} and was held at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] on December 31, 1995. The game was the final contest of the [[1995 NCAA Division I-A football season]] for both teams, and ended in a 28&ndash;10 victory for [[Virginia Tech]].

In 1995, the Sugar Bowl was held under the rules of the [[Bowl Alliance]]. The Alliance, predecessor to the modern [[Bowl Championship Series]], was intended to match the champions of the [[Southeastern Conference]], [[Big East Conference]], [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], [[Southwest Conference]], and one at-large team against each other in the Sugar Bowl, [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], and [[Fiesta Bowl]]. Each year, the two highest-ranked teams would play in a [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|National Championship Game]] held in place of one of the bowl games. The site of the national championship game rotated among the three bowl games, as did the date of each game. Following the [[1995 NCAA Division I-A football season|1995 college football season]], the Sugar Bowl was designated for December 31, marking the first time two Sugar Bowls would be held in the same calendar year.

Virginia Tech was selected to play in the 1995 Sugar Bowl by virtue of winning the Big East football championship. The Hokies, who finished 9&ndash;2 during the regular season, actually were co-Big East champions. The {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Miami Hurricanes|title=University of Miami}}, which tied the Hokies, was ineligible for post-season play due to sanctions imposed as a result of recruiting rules violations. The Hokies played the University of Texas, which finished 10&ndash;1&ndash;1 during the regular season en route to becoming [[Southwest Conference]] champions. The Southwest Conference was scheduled to disband after the football season, but its champion was guaranteed one of the at-large spots in the Bowl Alliance.

The game was marred by the revelation that a Texas player had been competing under an assumed name. Other off-the-field incidents also took place prior to the game. Because the game was Virginia Tech's first trip to a major bowl game, ticket sales were brisk. Texas took an early lead in the competition and led 10&ndash;7 at [[halftime]], but Virginia Tech's defense [[shutout|shut out]] Texas' offense in the second half and Tech scored 21 unanswered points. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Virginia Tech [[wide receiver]] [[Bryan Still]] was named the game's [[most valuable player]].

== Team selection ==
{{main|Bowl Alliance}}
In the 1995 college football season, teams were selected for the Sugar Bowl under the new Bowl Alliance system. The Bowl Alliance matched up the conference champions of the [[Big East]], [[Southeastern Conference]], [[Big 12 Conference]], [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], and two at-large teams in games to determine an official national champion. Prior to the introduction of the Bowl Alliance and its predecessor, the [[Bowl Coalition]], national champions were determined by various college football polls that sometimes named different teams as champion.

Under the Alliance system, the two highest-ranked members of Alliance conferences were matched up in a national championship game. The lower-ranked conference champions and two-at large teams would play each other in other bowl games. In 1995, one of these at-large spots was reserved for the champion of the [[Southwest Conference]], which had been a member of the Bowl Coalition but was scheduled to dissolve after the 1995 season. Its members joined different conferences in an attempt to increase their revenue.<ref>Asher, Mark. "A new bowl alliance makes title game closer", ''The Washington Post''. August 5, 1994. Page F2.</ref>

The [[1996 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] hosted the national championship game for the 1995 season, and thus had the first and second pick of eligible Bowl Alliance teams. The [[1996 Orange Bowl (January)|Orange Bowl]] had the third and fifth selections, while the Sugar Bowl had the fourth and sixth picks.<ref>Carlson, Steve. "Va. Tech fans must pull for Syracuse over Miami", ''The Virginian-Pilot''. November 25, 1995.

Page Sports 5.</ref> The Sugar Bowl was assigned the December 31 date, marking the first time it had been held on that date instead of its traditional January 1 date.

=== Texas ===
The University of Texas Longhorns began the 1995 college football season after winning eight games and losing four in 1994, a year that culminated with the Longhorns in a five-way tie for the Southwest Conference championship and with a 35&ndash;31 victory over the [[1994 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|North Carolina Tar Heels]] in the [[1994 Sun Bowl]].<ref>University of Texas Sports Information Department.

The Longhorns got the 1995 season off to a successful start with a 38&ndash;17 win against the {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Hawaii Rainbows|title=Hawaii Rainbows}} in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]].<ref>Rosner, Mark.

Page Sports 1.</ref> The consecutive wins raised Texas to No. 13 in the country, but the Longhorns fumbled away their third game of the season, a 55&ndash;27 defeat at the hands of [[1995 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] that involved five turnovers by the Longhorns.<ref>Wangrin, Mark. "Smothered in South Bend - Dismal special teams, fourth-quarter collapse help dig Longhorns' 55-27 grave", ''Austin-American Statesman''. September 24, 1995. Page C1.</ref>

After the loss, the Longhorns fell to No. 21 in the country. They quickly recovered however, reeling off two wins in subsequent weeks: a 35&ndash;10 victory over {{cfb link|year=1995|team=SMU Mustangs|title=Southern Methodist University}}<ref>Wangrin, Mark. "Texas pens up ponies", ''Austin-American Statesman''. September 30, 1995. Page C1.</ref> and a 37&ndash;13 win against {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Rice Owls|title=Rice}}.<ref>Wangrin, Mark.

It was just the fifth tie in the 89-game history of the rivalry that started in 1900.<ref>Wangrin, Mark. "Twisted plot, big knot", ''Austin-American Statesman''. October 15, 1995. Page C1.</ref>

Following the tie against Oklahoma, No. 16 Texas struggled against No. 14 {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Virginia Cavaliers|title=Virginia}} in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Not until the game's final play did the Longhorns secure their 17&ndash;16 win over the favored Cavaliers. The game was the 700th victory in Texas football history and marked the only time in Texas' first 103 years of football that a game ended with Texas kicking a winning field goal.<ref>Wangrin, Mark.

=== Virginia Tech ===
The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the 1995 season after having finished with an 8&ndash;4 overall record in 1994. That season culminated with a 45&ndash;23 loss to [[1994 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]] in the [[1994 Gator Bowl]].<ref>Virginia Tech Athletics Communications Department. [http://www.hokiesports.com/football/pastschedules.html?season=1994 "Virginia Tech past football schedules: 1994&ndash;1995"], Hokiesports.com. Accessed May 30, 2009.</ref> Heading into the 1995 season, fans and coaches expected Tech to improve on its previous performance. Most commentators, however, expected a season comparable to 1994's: a second-place finish in the Big East and a trip to the Gator Bowl.<ref>Carlson, Steve. "Miami's on top, but No. 2 is in dispute", ''The Virginian-Pilot''. August 6, 1995. Page C4.</ref><ref>Bogaczyk, Jack. "Tech's key to success on the line", The Roanoke Times. September 6, 1995. Page B1.</ref> This was borne out by the preseason college football polls. The AP Poll put Tech 24th, while the coaches' poll had Tech 26th.<ref>The Associated Press. "UVA loses game, not ranking", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''. August 28, 1995. Page C6.</ref>

Those who tempered their expectations of the Hokies appeared to be vindicated in Tech's first game of the season, which took place on September 7, a week later than most teams started regular-season play. Tech rose to No. 20 in the country on the basis of other teams losing their season openers. A similar fate befell the Hokies, who lost to {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Boston College Eagles|title=Boston College}}, 20&ndash;14.<ref>King, Randy. "Hokies stopped short", ''The Roanoke Times''. September 8, 1995. Page B1.</ref> The opening-game loss was a "discouraging note" to begin the season in the eyes of at least one commentator.<ref>Lipper, Bob. "Hokies' autumn of promise begins on discouraging note", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''. September 8, 1995. Page D1.</ref> Because Tech's opening game was on a Thursday night, the Hokies had an extra two days to prepare for their next opponent, {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|title=Cincinnati}}. The extra time did not help, however, and the Hokies were [[shutout|shut out]], 16&ndash;0 by underdog Cincinnati. The shutout was the first scoreless effort by the Hokies since 1981 and caused sportswriters to call the Hokies "the most overrated team in the country."<ref>King, Randy. "Tech looking for answers", ''The Roanoke Times''. September 17, 1995. Page B1.</ref>

Following the Cincinnati loss, the Hokies had one week to prepare for a matchup against No. 17 {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Miami Hurricanes|title=Miami}}, the team predicted to win the Big East in preseason polls. The Hokies had not beaten Miami in 12 previous matchups, but they managed an upset 13&ndash;7 victory on September 23.<ref>King, Randy. "Hokies ambush 'Canes", ''The Roanoke Times''. September 24, 1995. Page C1.</ref> At the time, the one-week turnaround from embarrassing defeat to unexpected triumph caused some commentators to declare the win the biggest in Virginia Tech football history.<ref>Carlson, Steve. "Tech's biggest ever? A fair question", The Virginian-Pilot. September 24, 1995. Page C4.</ref> Following the Miami win, Virginia Tech started a winning streak that continued for the remainder of the regular season. In total, Tech won its final nine regular-season games, including two wins over ranked opponents: No. 20 {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Syracuse Orange|title=Syracuse}} and at No. 13 {{cfb link|year=1995|team=Virginia Cavaliers|title=Virginia}}. The 36&ndash;29 defeat of Virginia was Tech's closest victory during the span and elevated Tech to No. 13 in the nation.<ref>Virginia Tech Athletics Communications Department. [http://www.hokiesports.com/football/pastschedules.html?season=1995 "Virginia Tech past football schedules: 1995&ndash;1996"], Hokiesports.com. Accessed May 30, 2009.</ref>

The Miami Hurricanes kept pace with the Hokies throughout the regular season, winning every conference game after their loss to Tech. After Miami won its final game of the season and tied the Hokies for the Big East football championship (the Big East had no tiebreaker at the time),<ref>Teel, David. "Politics may do in Tech", ''The (Newport News) Daily Press''. October 31, 1995. Page C1.</ref> it appeared that Virginia Tech would be passed over for a Bowl Alliance game in favor of the Hurricanes.<ref>King, Randy. "Miami win puts hurtin' on Hokies", ''The Roanoke Times''. November 26, 1995. Page C1.</ref> Miami traditionally had a stronger football team and a wider following on television, making it more attractive to bowl-game officials.<ref>Teel, David. "Hokies probably are out of Alliance", ''The (Newport News) Daily Press''. November 26, 1995. Page C3.</ref> But Miami's bowl hopes evaporated after the NCAA announced Miami would be put under sanctions for recruiting rules violations. One of the sanctions included a ban from bowl games, which Miami elected to take after the 1995 season instead of delaying until 1996.<ref>Wood, Skip. "How sweet it is for Tech", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''. December 2, 1995. Page D1.</ref> After the sanctions were announced, the only question for the Hokies was whether they would be bound for the Orange Bowl in Miami or the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. That question was resolved on December 3, 1995, when Bowl Alliance officials announced their selection of Virginia Tech and Texas for the Sugar Bowl.<ref name="announce">King, Randy. "Hokies top gridiron season with Sugar", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 4, 1995. Page A1.</ref>

== Pregame buildup ==
The game between the Hokies and the Longhorns was the first meeting of the two teams.<ref>Virginia Tech Athletics Communications Department.

It was Texas' third Sugar Bowl appearance and its first since 1958.<ref name="Texas announce"/> In exchange for playing in the game, each team received $8.3 million. Thanks to revenue-sharing agreements with Big East conference members, Virginia Tech received $3.5 million, minus expenses, for playing in the Sugar Bowl.<ref name="announce"/> Pregame media coverage of the event focused on Virginia Tech making its first appearance in a major bowl game and Texas' resurgence as a major college football power.<ref>King, Randy.

Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's first major bowl game in school history, tickets and travel packages were in high demand. Prior to the first day of ticket sales, the price of travel packages skyrocketed due to demand.<ref>Applegate, Lisa. "Goin' south? You'll need a full wallet", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 5, 1995. Page A2.</ref> In Virginia, travel agencies hired temporary workers to meet demand, and in New Orleans, the demand for hotel rooms was so great that many hotels instituted a three-night minimum stay.<ref>Applegate, Lisa. "There's no business like bowl business", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 5, 1995. Page A1.</ref>

Tickets officially went on sale December 4, and three days later, Virginia Tech had sold out its entire initial allotment of 15,000 tickets.<ref>Staff Reports. "More tickets on the way for Hokies", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 7, 1995.

December 9, 1995. Page B1.</ref> Many fans who were turned away at the Virginia Tech ticket office bought tickets from the [[secondary market]] or traveled to New Orleans in hopes of buying tickets at the game. So many Virginia Tech fans traveled to the game that the [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery County]] school district extended its winter break one day to avoid a shortage of teachers and students.<ref>Applegate, Lisa. "Sugar sweetens vacation", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 8, 1995.

==== Texas ====
At the University of Texas, ticket sales likewise were rapid. On the first day of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand was so great that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket.<ref>Nichols, Bill. "UT students camp out for tickets to Sugar Bowl", ''The Dallas Morning News''. December 8, 1995. Page B8.</ref> Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available.<ref>Lindell, Chuck; Monroe, Nichole; and Walker, Kelli.

=== Off-field problems ===
Three Virginia Tech players were charged with crimes before the Sugar Bowl. Linebacker Tony Morrison and receiver James Crawford were suspended indefinitely from the team and did not travel to the game. Morrison was arrested for public intoxication, petty larceny and destruction of property, while Crawford was charged with defrauding a garage keeper and felony hit and run.<ref>Teel, David. "Two Hokies suspended", ''The (Newport News) Daily Press''. December 13, 1995.

"Latest arrest for Hokies hits home", ''The (Newport News) Daily Press''. December 23, 1995. Page B1.</ref>

On Virginia Tech's first night in New Orleans, redshirt center Keith Short missed the team's 2 a.m. curfew. In response, Tech head coach [[Frank Beamer]] ushered Short to the local Greyhound bus depot and put the player on a bus to his home in Richmond.<ref>King, Randy. [http://www.roanoke.com/sports/vtfootball/wb/xp-16031 "Hokies depart for the Big Easy"], The Roanoke Times. December 28, 2004.

"Beamer: This ain't Hillsville", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 27, 1995. Page B1.</ref>

Beamer himself was the object of some off-field controversy when [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] considered offering him its head football coaching job during the days prior to the Sugar Bowl.<ref>Carlson, Steve. "Beamer atop Georgia wish list", The Virginian-Pilot. December 14, 1995. Page C1.</ref> Beamer denied any interest in the position,<ref>Bogaczyk, Jack.

The biggest off-the-field incident was revealed on the final weekend before the Sugar Bowl. Texas reserve defensive back [[Ron Weaver|Ron McKelvey]] was revealed to be using an assumed name. In reality, he was a 30-year-old man named [[Ron Weaver]] who had played for a junior-college team and a small-college team under other assumed names. Weaver disappeared prior to the Sugar Bowl, but stated that he had used the assumed name in order to gather information for a book about the inner workings of Texas football.<ref name="deceit"/><ref>Bogaczyk, Jack.

=== Offensive matchups ===
==== Texas offense ====
In 1995, the Texas Longhorns boasted a high-powered offense that accumulated 5,199&nbsp;yards of total offense during the regular season. Texas' offense was No. 17 in the country and averaged 31.7 points per game and 6.1 yards per play.<ref>Lipper, Bob. "Flash and panache?", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''. December 30, 1995. Page D1.</ref>

The Longhorns were led on offense by quarterback [[James Brown (quarterback)|James Brown]], who completed 163 of 322 passes (50.6%) for 2,447&nbsp;yards, 19&nbsp;touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.<ref name="eyes"/> These figures were enough for him to set the Texas single-season records for passing yards and passing touchdowns.<ref name="eyes"/> Brown finished the season with a [[passer rating]] of 177, No. 1 in the NCAA in 1995.<ref>Wood, Skip.

On the ground, Texas' rushing offense was led by two [[running back]]s: [[Ricky Williams]] and Shon Mitchell. Together, they averaged 207 yards per game, good enough for No. 22 nationally.<ref name="TeD">Carlson, Steve. "Hokie defense lives up to goal vs. Texas - and then some", ''The Virginian-Pilot''.

==== Virginia Tech offense ====
The Virginia Tech offense progressed during the course of the regular season. In the Hokies' first six games, they averaged just 13.4 points. In their final six games, they averaged 42.3 points per game.<ref name="longdef">Teel, David. "Longhorns' march keyed by defense", ''The (Newport News) Daily Press''. December 30, 1995.

Page C1.</ref> The Hokies also finished with 4,233 net yards and 321 points; both figures were in the top five for Virginia Tech season offenses to that point.<ref name="TechO"/>

The Hokies were led on offense by quarterback [[Jim Druckenmiller]], who completed 151 of his 294 pass attempts (51.4%) for 2,103 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.<ref>Virginia Tech Athletics Communications Department. "1995 Statistics", ''1996 Virginia Tech Football Media Guide''. Blacksburg, Va., 1996. p. 120.</ref> Druckenmiller's favorite receiver was [[Bryan Still]], who caught 32 passes for 628 yards and three touchdowns despite missing 2<U+00BD> games due to an injured shoulder. Two of Still's receptions were for more than 80 yards apiece, making him the first Virginia Tech wide receiver to catch two passes of more than 80 yards in the same season.<ref>King, Randy. "Deep threat still going", The Roanoke Times. December 28, 1995. Page B1.</ref>

On the ground, the Tech offense was led by two running backs: [[Ken Oxendine]] and Dwayne Thomas. Thomas was a fifth-year senior who accumulated 673 rushing yards and seven touchdowns despite missing three games due to injury.<ref>Wood, Skip. "Reversal of fortune as careers end", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''. December 30, 1995.

Conaty underwent surgery and played despite not being fully healed.<ref>King, Randy. "Tough break won't stop big, bad Billy", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 30, 1995. Page B1.</ref>

One weakness in Virginia Tech's offense was in the kicking game, controlled by placekicker Atle Larsen. During the regular season, Larsen was successful on just 12 of 20 field goal attempts, and his longest successful kick was from just 44 yards away.<ref>Bogaczyk, Jack. "He hopes Tech wins by a foot", ''The Roanoke Times''. December 29, 1995. Page B1.</ref>

=== Defensive matchups ===
==== Virginia Tech defense ====
Virginia Tech's defense came into the 1995 Sugar Bowl ranked 10th in the country in total defense. This was due in large part to the Hokies' success in rushing defense. Tech boasted the No. 1 rushing defense in the country, allowing an average of only 77.4 yards per game on the ground.<ref name="Brown">Harris, Mike. "Brown is golden with major honors", ''Richmond Times-Dispatch''. December 7, 1995. Page D1.</ref> Tech also had the No. 5 scoring defense in the country, allowing just 14 points per game on average. Tech's defense was No. 11 in total, allowing just 285.9 yards per game.<ref name="Brown"/> The Hokies also sacked opposing quarterbacks 44 times during the regular season and were ranked No. 23 in pass defense.<ref>Wood, Skip. "Tech D not giving foes run for money", Richmond Times-Dispatch. December 24, 1995. Page D1.</ref>

The Hokie defense was led by [[Cornell Brown]], a first-team All-America selection who also won the [[Dudley Award]], which is given to the top Division I college football player in Virginia.<ref name="Brown"/> Brown finished the regular season with 103 tackles and 14 sacks during the regular season.<ref>Teel, David.

"Yarborough, Tech DBs are secondary to none", The Roanoke Times. December 26, 1995. Page BG-10.</ref> 

The Hokies also had excellent special teams defense. During the regular season, the Hokies blocked eight kicks, including four punts.<ref>Nichols, Bill. "Va.

==== Texas defense====
On defense, the Longhorns were ranked No. 55 nationally in total defense and No. 5 in the Southwest Conference.<ref>Broyles, Clifford. "UT defense v. critics: Case is finally moot", ''San Antonio Express-News''. December 30, 1995. Page Sports 1.</ref> This was despite a marked improvement as the regular season progressed.

=== First quarter ===
Virginia Tech kicked off to Texas to begin the game, and the Longhorns returned the kick to the 35-yard line. On the first play of the game, Brown attempted to pass downfield, but Tech defended the Texas receivers and Brown [[quarterback scramble|scrambled]] for a four-yard loss. Texas regained the yardage after Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then Longhorns running back Ricky Williams gained six yards on a run up the middle. A third-down pass fell incomplete, and the Longhorns went [[three and out]] on the first possession of the game. Texas punted, and the Hokies returned the kick to their 26-yard line.<ref name="1st">The NCAA. 1995 Sugar Bowl statistics, "1995 Sugar Bowl Play-by-play: 1st Quarter". December 31, 1995.</ref>

On Tech's first offensive play of the game, a pass by Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was dropped. During the next play, Tech picked up four yards on a running play. On third down, Druckenmiller completed a pass to wide receiver Bryan Still, but the play fell one foot short of a first down. Tech punted after three plays, just as Texas had done. Texas returned the kick to its 22-yard line, and with 11:49 remaining in the quarter, the Longhorns began their second possession of the game.<ref name="1st"/>

The first play of the possession resulted in a five-yard penalty against Tech. The second play resulted in the initial first down of the game as Brown completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Adams. After the first down, Williams picked up two yards on a running play, but Texas lost that short gain when Brown fumbled the ball during the next play. Brown lost seven yards, but recovered the ball. On third down, Brown attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped short of the line of scrimmage. Texas' punt was [[fair catch|fair caught]] at the 29-yard line, and Virginia Tech began its second possession.<ref name="1st"/>

Tech running back Dwayne Thomas gained nine yards on the first Tech play, then the Hokies earned their initial first down on an [[option run]] that gained three yards. After the first down, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, then Thomas ran for a six-yard gain. On third down, a long pass downfield was knocked down by a Texas defender, and the Hokies punted back to Texas. The kick was fair caught at the 13-yard line, but Tech was penalized 15 yards for interfering with the catch.<ref name="1st"/>

Texas began its third possession with 7:58 remaining in the quarter. From the 28-yard line, running back Shon Mitchell gained 14 yards and a first down at the 42-yard line. Brown then completed a 26-yard pass to Adams, who earned a first down at the Tech 32-yard line. Now in Tech territory, Mitchell gained eight yards on a run to the left side of the field. On second down, Williams ran straight ahead for a first down at the Tech 17-yard line. Mitchell then advanced to the 12-yard line on a running play, but Brown threw an incomplete pass on second down. Facing a third down and needing five yards, Texas was stopped for a short gain, but Tech was called for an offsides penalty. The five yards negated the third-down stop and gave Texas a first down at the six-yard line of Virginia Tech. Two plays later, Brown completed a pass to tight end Pat Fitzgerald, who ran into the [[end zone]] for a touchdown. The subsequent [[extra point]] kick was good, and Texas took a 7&ndash;0 lead with 4:32 remaining in the first quarter.<ref name="1st"/>

Virginia Tech downed Texas' subsequent kickoff in its end zone for a [[touchback]], and the Hokies attempted to answer the Texas score starting at the Tech 20-yard line. During the first play after the kickoff, Texas and Tech both committed penalties. After the penalties, Tech had a first down at its 27-yard line. After the penalties, running back Ken Oxendine attempted to run up the middle of the field, but had the ball knocked loose by defender [[Tony Brackens]]. Texas recovered the fumble and the Longhorns' offense returned to the field at the Tech 32-yard line.<ref name="1st"/>

After the turnover, Texas attempted a trick play, but the pass by a wide receiver was knocked down by the Virginia Tech defense. After an eight-yard gain on a running play, Texas was penalized 10&nbsp;yards for holding. The Longhorns were unable to regain the yardage lost to the penalty and punted to the Hokies. With 2:15 remaining in the opening quarter, Tech fair caught the punt at its 19-yard line.<ref name="1st"/> 

After a short gain on first down, Druckenmiller completed a 13-yard pass to fullback Brian Edmonds. The play resulted in a first down at the Tech 34-yard line. Two short plays resulted in six yards, setting up a third down and four yards. Rather than attempt a conversion prior to the end of the quarter, the Hokies let the clock roll down with the Longhorns in the lead, 7&ndash;0.<ref name="1st"/>

=== Second quarter ===
The second quarter began with Virginia Tech in possession of the ball at its 40-yard line and facing a third-and-four situation. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Holmes for 13 yards and a first down at the Texas 47-yard line. Once there, however, Druckenmiller threw a pass that bounced off a Tech receiver and was caught by Texas defender Jason Reeves, who returned it to the Tech 33-yard line. On the first play after the turnover, the Texas offense lost four yards on a rushing play that went out of bounds. Brown then completed a two-yard pass to Fitzgerald, setting up a long third-down play. The Longhorns were unable to earn a first down and sent in kicker Phil Dawson to attempt a 52-yard field goal. The kick attempt equaled his career long and grazed one of the uprights of the goal post, but the kick was successful and gave Texas a 10&ndash;0 lead with 13:19 remaining in the first half.<ref name="2nd">The NCAA. 1995 Sugar Bowl statistics, "1995 Sugar Bowl Play-by-play: 2nd Quarter". December 31, 1995.</ref>

Texas' post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech four-yard line. A two-yard run was followed by a 11-yard carry by Ken Oxendine who earned a first down at the Tech 17-yard line. After the first down, Oxendine earned another six yards. Druckenmiller then completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Bryan Jennings for a first down at the Tech 35-yard line. Texas committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then a long pass downfield fell incomplete. Two more plays failed to gain a first down, and the Hokies punted.<ref name="2nd"/>

The Tech kick was returned to the 16-yard line of Texas, and with 9:15 remaining in the first half, the Longhorns began their first full possession of the quarter. On the first play of the possession, Brown completed a 15-yard pass to Adams. From the 31-yard line, Texas gained six yards on two plays, then the Longhorns were called for having an illegal player downfield during third down. Texas' punt was returned to the 20-yard line, and Tech's offense returned to the field.<ref name="2nd"/>

Running back Dwayne Thomas gained six yards on the first play, then earned a first down at the 30-yard line on an option play. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a nine-yard throw to Still. Tech committed a false-start penalty on third down, but the Hokies made up the penalty and earned a first down when Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings at the Texas 45-yard line. On the first play after the completion, Druckenmiller was [[quarterback sack|sacked]] for a one-yard loss. A second-down pass was dropped, a third-down pass was incomplete, and the Hokies punted again.<ref name="2nd"/>

Texas fair caught the punt at their 14-yard line. On the first play after the kick, a run up the middle was stopped for the loss of a yard. Williams then gained two yards, and Brown threw an incomplete pass. Texas went three-and-out for the first time in the second quarter and prepared to punt. Bryan Still fielded the kick at the Tech 40-yard line and returned it 60 yards to the end zone for Virginia Tech's first points of the game. The subsequent extra point was good, and with 2:34 remaining in the first half, Tech cut Texas' lead to 10&ndash;7.<ref name="2nd"/>

Adams returned Tech's kickoff to the Texas 21-yard line, and the Longhorns' offense took the field. On the first play, Brown completed a 13-yard pass to Adams, who earned a first down at the 34-yard line. Mitchell gained four yards on a running play, then Texas was penalized for having an ineligible player downfield. On the play after the penalty, Texas was penalized for an illegal formation, negating a completed pass for a first down. The Longhorns then faced a third down and 11, but Brown's third-down pass was knocked down and the Longhorns punted to end their final possession of the first half.<ref name="2nd"/>

The ball bounced off a Virginia Tech player, causing a scramble for the loose ball. Virginia Tech recovered it at their 19-yard line, and Druckenmiller started a hurry-up offensive drive for the Hokies, who had 56 seconds to move into scoring possession. On the first play, Druckenmiller completed an 18-yard play to move the ball to the Tech 38-yard line. Druckenmiller then completed a 16-yard pass to Holmes for a first down at the Texas 46-yard line. From there, however, Druckenmiller threw three incomplete passes and Tech punted with 15 seconds remaining in the first half. Texas ran out the remaining seconds on the clock and went into halftime with a 10&ndash;7 lead.<ref name="2nd"/>

=== Third quarter ===
The game's [[halftime show]] featured both school marching bands and a musical ensemble featuring music by [[The Beatles]]. Various high school marching bands also participated in the show, which was produced by Bowl Games of America.<ref>Professional Sports Publications, Inc. "Halftime", ''1995 Nokia Sugar Bowl Official Souvenir Magazine''. December 1995, New York, N.Y. Page 32.</ref>

Following halftime, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who returned it to the Tech 41-yard line. On the first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running play up the middle. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas was called for a five-yard running into the kicker penalty and Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.<ref name="3rd">The NCAA. 1995 Sugar Bowl statistics, "1995 Sugar Bowl Play-by-play: 3rd Quarter". December 31, 1995.</ref>

Texas' first possession of the second half began with a two-yard run to the right. After that, Brown completed a first-down pass to Adams at the Texas 28-yard line. Following an incomplete pass, Williams ran for a short gain and Texas was stopped short of the needed yardage on third down. After the punt, Tech's offense started at their 11-yard line. Thomas gained six yards on a rushing play, then Druckenmiller completed a two-yard pass to Edmonds. On third down, Texas' Brackens moved offsides and Tech was given a first down at their 24-yard line. Thomas then broke free on a running play for an 11-yard gain and a first down at the Tech 35-yard line. After the first down, Druckenmiller scrambled for no gain, then Edmonds gained six yards on a running play. On third down, a Druckenmiller pass was knocked down at the line of scrimmage by a Texas defender and the Hokies had to punt.<ref name="3rd"/>

Texas returned the kick to its 32-yard line, and on the first play from scrimmage, Tech sacked Brown for a loss of nine yards. Williams regained five of the lost yards, but on third down Brown threw an incomplete pass. Texas' punt bounced out of bounds at the 33-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense returned to the field with 5:30 remaining in the quarter.<ref name="3rd"/>

The Hokies began their drive with a seven-yard pass from Druckenmiller to Marcus Parker. Oxendine then ran ahead and gained a first down at the 46-yard line. From there, Druckenmiller completed a 28-yard pass to Jennings at the Texas 26-yard line. Oxendine was tackled after a gain of two yards, then Tech was penalized five yards for an illegal shift. After being pushed back to the 30-yard line, Druckenmiller completed a 28-yard pass to Still, who picked up a first down at the Texas two-yard line. On the next play, Parker rushed through the Texas defense for the Hokies' first offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and with 2:32 remaining in the third quarter, Virginia Tech took its first lead of the game.<ref name="3rd"/>

Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed in the end zone for a touchback. Texas' offense thus began its drive at its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was an [[end-around]] that gained 10&nbsp;yards and a first down for Texas. After an incomplete pass, Mitchell gained five yards on a [[Counter trey|counter run]]. On third down, Williams caught a six-yard pass for a first down at the Texas 41-yard line. Mitchell ran six yards on first down, but was stopped after a gain of just one yard on second down. The second-down play caused the final seconds to tick off the clock in the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 14&ndash;10.<ref name="3rd"/>

=== Fourth quarter ===
The fourth quarter began with Texas in possession of the ball and facing a third down-and-three situation at its 47-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Brown completed a first-down pass to wide receiver Matt Davis at the Tech 47-yard line. After a Texas pass was batted down, Mitchell ran to the left for a gain of two yards. On third down, Brown was pressured by the Virginia Tech defense and threw an interception to Virginia Tech's William Yarborough, who caught the ball at the Tech 31-yard line.<ref name="4th">The NCAA. 1995 Sugar Bowl statistics, "1995 Sugar Bowl Play-by-play: 4th Quarter". December 31, 1995.</ref>

After the turnover, Druckenmiller got Virginia Tech's drive started with a first-down pass to the Tech 42-yard line. After a short run by Edmonds, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, setting up a third-and-seven for Virginia Tech's offense. During the third-down play, wide receiver Bryan Still broke free of the Texas defense and caught a 55-yard pass from Druckenmiller for Tech's second offensive touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was successful, and Tech took a 21&ndash;10 lead with 12:28 remaining in the game.<ref name="4th"/>

After Tech's kickoff was downed in the end zone, the Longhorns' offense began a new drive from their 20-yard line. Brown threw an incomplete pass, then completed a first-down pass to Adams at the 32-yard line. From there, Brown threw an incomplete pass, then tossed a 15-yard [[screen pass]] to Fitzgerald, who gained a first down at the Texas 42-yard line. Williams crossed into Virginia Tech territory on the next play as he ran straight ahead for a 13-yard gain. A one-yard run was followed by an incomplete pass, and on third down Brown threw an interception directly to Virginia Tech defender [[Torrian Gray]], who returned the pass to the Tech 33-yard line.<ref name="4th"/>

On the first play after the turnover, Druckenmiller completed a 16-yard pass to Cornelius White, who picked up a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. Texas then committed a five-yard offsides penalty before Oxendine ran forward for four yards. On the next play, Oxendine fumbled the ball after being hit by a Texas defender. The loose ball was picked up by a Texas defender, who returned it to the 50-yard line. Brown threw two incomplete passes, then Tech committed a five-yard penalty. On third down, Brown completed a 21-yard pass to Davis, who gained a first down at the Tech 24-yard line. After the long gain, Brown threw two more incomplete passes. On third down, Brown threw another interception to Gray, who returned the ball to the Tech 31-yard line and allowed the Hokies' offense to return to the field with 7:33 remaining in the game.<ref name="4th"/>

Tech's Thomas gained six yards on a run up the middle, then Druckenmiller ran ahead for a one-yard gain. On third down, Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, negating what would have been a first-down run. A long pass on third down fell incomplete, and Tech punted for the first time in the quarter. The Longhorns fair caught the ball at the their 30-yard line with 5:25 remaining in the game.<ref name="4th"/>

Trailing by 11, and with time running down, Texas needed to score quickly. Brown threw an incomplete pass, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. During the sack, Brown fumbled, and the ball was picked up by a Virginia Tech defender who returned it into the end zone for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech expanded its lead to 28&ndash;10 with 5:06 remaining in the game.<ref name="4th"/>

After the score, Tech was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration, allowing Texas a better chance to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.<ref name="4th"/>

Virginia Tech returned the kick to their 43-yard line, and the Hokies proceeded to run out the clock by executing running plays<U+2014>which do not stop the clock at their conclusion. Tempers ran high among Texas players, and Texas defender Stoney Clark was ejected from the game after throwing the football at a Virginia Tech player following the conclusion of a play. Texas was assessed two personal-foul penalties, which advanced the ball to the Texas 31-yard line and gave Virginia Tech a first down. Tech continued to run down the clock with rushing plays, and the Hokies brought in freshman backup quarterback Al Clark to supervise the game's final plays. The clock rolled to zero, and Virginia Tech secured a 28&ndash;10 victory.<ref name="4th"/>
