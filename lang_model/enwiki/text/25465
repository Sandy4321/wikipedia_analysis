'''Eli Lilly''' (July 8, 1838 &ndash; June 6, 1898) was a [[soldier]], [[pharmaceutical]] [[chemist]], [[industrialist]], and founder of the eponymous [[Eli Lilly and Company]] pharmaceutical corporation. Lilly enlisted in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], he recruited a company of men to serve with him, and was later promoted to [[colonel]] and given command of a force of [[cavalry]]. He was captured near the end of the war, and was held in a war prison until the war ended. After the war, he attempted to run a [[plantation]] in [[Mississippi]] but failed and returned to his pharmacy profession after the death of his wife. 

After working in several pharmacies with partners, he opened his own business in 1876. His company was successful and he soon became wealthy after making numerous advances in medicines. Two of the early advances he pioneered were creating gelatin capsules to hold medicine and fruit flavoring for liquid medicines. Eli Lilly & Co. was the first pharmaceutical company of its kind; it staffed a dedicated research department and put in place numerous quality assurance measures. Using his wealth, Lilly engaged in numerous [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] pursuits. He turned over his company's management to his son in 1890, and continued his engagement in charity and civic advancement as his primary focus until his death from [[cancer]]. The company he founded has grown into one of the largest and most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in [[Indiana]].

==Early life==
===Family and background===
Eli Lilly was born the son of Gustavus and Esther Lilly in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on July 8, 1838. His family was of [[Swedish]] decent, and had moved to the [[low country]] of [[France]] before his great-grandparents immigrated to [[Maryland]] in 1789. His parents were second generation immigrants.<ref name = p58>Price, p. 58</ref> The Lilly family moved to [[Kentucky]] while Lilly was a young child and he attended public school. His family moved again in 1852 to [[Greencastle, Indiana]], where he apprenticed to become a [[printing press|printer]].<ref name = NCAB>White, p. 83</ref> In 1854, he served an apprenticeship to become a chemist and pharmacist under Henry Lawrence at the Good Samaritan Drug Store in [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]]. His parents enrolled him to study [[pharmacology]] at  the [[Methodist]] operated Asbury College (now [[Depauw University]]), and he graduated after two years.  Lilly became acquainted with Emily Lemen, the daughter of a [[Indianapolis]] merchant, and the couple  married in 1860 and purchased a home in the city. He opened his own small drug store there in 1861.<ref name = b911> Bodenhamer, p. 911</ref>

Lilly grew up in a Methodist household, and his family was [[prohibition]]ist and anti-slavery; their beliefs were part of their motivation for moving to Indiana.<ref name = p59> Price, p. 59</ref> He and his family were members of the [[US Democrat|Democratic party]] during his early life, but they became [[US Republican|Republicans]] during the years leading up to the civil war.<ref name = p60/>

===American Civil War===

[[Image:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]

Lilly enlisted in the [[Union Army]] at the start of the [[American Civil War]] and his first child, [[Josiah K. Lilly Sr.|Josiah]], was born in 1861 while he was away. He recruited the 18th Battery, Indiana Light Artillery among his classmates, friends, local merchants and farmers. His unit was known as the Lilly Battery and was part of the [[Lightning Brigade]] commanded by Col. [[John T. Wilder]]. Lilly was elected to serve as the captain of his unit from August 1862 until the winter of 1863.<ref name = NCAB/> His only prior military experience had been in a Lafayette [[Indiana Legion]] unit, and several of his artillerymen considered him too young and intemperate to command. Despite his initial inexperience, he became a competent artillery officer and his battery was instrumental in several important battles, including [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]], [[Second Battle of Chattanooga|Second Chattanooga]], and [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]].<ref name = b911/>

Lilly was promoted from the battery to become a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of [[cavalry]].  During a mission in the south, he was captured in Alabama  by [[Nathan B. Forrest]] in 1864 and held in a [[Confederate States of America | Confederate]] war prison until the end of the war in 1865, when he was paroled and returned home.<ref name = p59/> His colonel's title stayed with him for the rest of his life, and his friends and family used it as a nickname for him. Lilly  served as chairman of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] in 1893, a brotherhood of Civil War veterans. During his term he helped organize an event that brought thousands of veterans together in Indianapolis for a reunion.<ref name = b911/><ref name = p60> Price, p. 60</ref>

===Business ventures===

After the war, Lilly attempted a new business venture and purchased a [[cotton]] [[plantation]] in [[Mississippi]]. He moved his family to their new home to live where the entire family was stricken with [[mosquito]]-born [[malaria]], a common disease because of the region's humid climate. Although Lilly and his son recovered, his wife Emily died there on August 20, 1866. She was eight months pregnant with the couple<U+2019>s second child at the time; their unborn son could not be saved and was stillborn. The death devastated Lilly who wrote to his family, <U+201C>I can hardly tell you how it glares at me<U+2026>it<U+2019>s a bitter, bitter truth<U+2026>Emily is indeed dead<U+2026><U+201D><ref name = p59/>  She was buried on the plantation, but once winter came she was disinterred and moved to Indiana to be reburied. Lilly<U+2019>s return to Indiana following her death allowed the plantation to fall into disrepair and his crop to fail, forcing him to file [[bankruptcy]] in 1868.  He remarried to Maria Cynthia Sloan in the following year and began working for Pattison, Moore & Talbott, a medicinal wholesale company. The business was purchased by H. Daly and Company during his employment there. He was able to save up enough money to again attempt another business venture.<ref name = b911/>

In 1869, he left Indiana and opened a successful drug store in [[Paris, Illinois]], with a partner, ''Binford & Lilly''. The business was profitable and allowed Lilly to save enough money to expand.  He began to formulate a plan to create a medicinal wholesale company of his own and began laying out business plans. He returned to Indianapolis in 1873, believing the city to be a superior place for business. Upon his return, he opened a drug store with a new partner, called ''Johnson & Lilly''. In 1876, he decided to branch out on his own and opened another drug store at 15 West Pearl Street, Indianapolis, on May 10. The sign for the business said <U+201C>Eli Lilly, Chemist<U+201D>.<ref name = b911/><ref name = p59/>

===Eli Lilly & co.===

{{main|Eli Lilly and Company}}

[[File:Original Eli Lilly and Company laboratory in 1876.jpg|thumb|right|A photo of Lilly's first laboratory building. Lilly and son Josiah are on the right side of the doorway.]]

Lilly<U+2019>s Indianapolis store started with only three employees, including his 14-year-old son Josiah, and $1,400 in [[working capital]]. His first innovation was gelatin-coating for pills and capsules. Following  his experience of the low-quality medicines used in the Civil War, Lilly committed himself to producing only high-quality prescription drugs, in contrast to the common and often ineffective [[patent medicines]] of the day.  One of the first medicines he began to produce was [[quinine]], a drug used to treat malaria.<ref name = p57/> His products, which worked as advertised and gained a reputation for quality,  became popular in the city. In his first year of business, sales reached $4,470, and by 1879 they had grown to $48,000. He hired his brother, James, to take over sales in 1878. Other family members were also employed by the growing company; his cousin Evan Lilly was hired as a bookkeeper and his grandsons, Eli and Josiah, were hired to run errands and perform other odd jobs. In 1881 he formally incorporated the company, naming it Eli Lilly and Company. By the late 1880s, he was one of the areas leading businessmen with over one-hundred employees and $200,000 in annual sales.<ref name = b911/>

[[File:Eli Lilly Medicines, 1906.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of Lilly's [[lozenges]] from a 1906 sales book.]]

Among the company<U+2019>s innovations was fruit flavoring for medicines and sugarcoated pills, making their medicines easier to take.<ref name = p59/>  His growing business led him to purchase additional facilities for research and production. He  purchased a complex of buildings on McCarty Street in south Indianapolis; other businesses followed and the area began to develop into a major business area of the city. In 1890, he turned over his business to his son, Josiah, who ran the company for the several decades.<ref name = b911/> The 1890s were a tumultuous decade economically, but the company was able to survive and came out stronger than ever.<ref name = p60/> In 1894 the company purchased a plant to be used solely for creating capsules. Several technological advances were made by the company, and the capsule creation was automated. Over the next few years, the company  created tens of millions of capsules and pills annually.<ref>Podczeck, p. 12&ndash;13</ref>

Although there were many other small pharmaceutical companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and it strong focus on quality.<ref>Bodenhamer, p. 540</ref> At first Lilly was the company<U+2019>s only researcher, but as his business grew, he created a laboratory and employed a department dedicated to creating new drugs,  hiring his first  research scientist in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly<U+2019>s. He  insisted on quality assurance, and instituted mechanisms to ensure that the drugs being produced worked as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and that only the correct dosages of medicines were contained in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of  giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician to determine if they needed the medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lilly.com/about/history/|title=Milestones in Medical Research|publisher=Eli Lilly & co.|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>

===Philanthropy===

By the time of his partial retirement from his business, Lilly was a wealthy millionaire. He had been involved in civic affairs for several years and became increasingly [[philanthropy|philanthropic]], granting funds to help charitable groups in the city. Working with a group of twenty-five other businessmen, he had begun sponsoring the [[Charity Organization Society]] in the late 1870s and soon became its primary patron. The organization was the forerunner of the [[United Way]] and worked to organized charitable organizations on a high level. It allowed the many organizations to easily interact and better help people in need by coordinating their efforts.<ref name = p57> Price, p. 57</ref>

Lilly<U+2019>s stated goals were to encourage economic growth and general development in Indianapolis. He attempted to achieve those goals by supporting local commercial organizations financially and through his personal advocacy and promotion. He first became active in local civics in 1879. He proposed the idea for a [[public water supply]] company to meet the needs of the city and the Indianapolis Water Company resulted from his ideas. The Commercial Club was founded by Lilly in 1890 and he was elected as its first president. The club was the primary vehicle for his city development goals and was a precursor to the Indianapolis [[Chamber of Commerce]].<ref name = p57/>  The group was instrumental in making numerous advances for the city, including city-wide paved streets, elevated railways to allow vehicles and people to pass beneath them,  and a city sewage system. The companies were created through private and public investments and operated at low-cost; in practice they belonged to customers of the company who slowly bought each company back from its initial investors. The model was later followed in most parts of the state. The group also helped fund the creation of parks, monuments, and memorials, and successfully attracted investment from other businessmen and organizations to expand the city's growing industries.<ref name = b912> Bodenhamer, p. 912</ref>

As the [[Indiana Gas Boom|Gas Boom]] began to sweep the state in the 1880s, Lilly and his Commercial Club advocated the creation of a public corporation to pump out the gas, pipe it to the city from the [[Trenton Gas Field]], and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project led to the creation of the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which was named by Lilly.<ref name = p57/> The company provided low cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run the city<U+2019>s first public transportation, a street car system.<ref>Glass, p. 16</ref>

During the [[Panic of 1893]], Lilly created a commission to help the poor who were adversely affected. His work with the commission led him to personally donate enough funds to create a children's hospital in Indianapolis to care for the many  children of families who had no money pay for normal medical care.<ref name = is>{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/business/companies/lilly/lilly.html|title=Eli Lilly & co.|publisher=[[Indianapolis Star]]|date=2001-01-01|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>

Lilly was an avid [[fisherman]] and built a family cottage on [[Lake Wawasee]] in 1887, where he enjoyed regular vacations and recreation. In 1892, he built the Wawasee Inn on the lake for commercial use. The site became a haven for the family, and his grandson later expanded the estate. His business continued to grow and by 1898 it had a product line of 2,005 items, and annual sales over $300,000.<ref name = b912/> Lilly became friends with former [[Governor of Indiana]] [[Oliver P. Morton]], and Morton suggested that Lilly use his Commercial Club to  advocate for the creation of a memorial to Indiana<U+2019>s many veterans of the Civil War. Accepting the suggestion, Lilly began raising funds to build the [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (Indianapolis)|Indiana Soldier and Sailor Monument]]. Construction began in 1888, but the monument was not completed until 1901. The interior of the monument houses a civil war museum, later named in honor of Lilly.<ref name = p59/>

Lilly was often urged to seek public office by his friends, and they attempted to nominate him to run for Governor of Indiana as a Republican in 1896, but he refused. He shunned public office and instead wanted to  focus his attention on his philanthropic organizations. He did regularly endorse candidates, and made substantial donations to politicians who advanced his causes.<ref name = p60/>

Lilly developed cancer in 1897 and died in his Indianapolis home on June 6, 1898. His bier was held on June 9 and attended by thousands before he was moved to his burial site, a large sepulcher in Indianapolis<U+2019> [[Crown Hill Cemetery]].<ref name = b912/> His grave is near that of former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Benjamin Harrison]].

Following his death, Lilly's son, Josiah, inherited Eli Lilly and Company. He continued to build the company before passing it on to his own sons, [[Eli Lilly (industrialist) |Eli Lilly]] and [[Josiah K. Lilly Jr.]] The Josiah and his two sons continued the philanthropy practiced by Lilly and later established the [[Lilly Endowment]] that in 1998 became the largest [[List of wealthiest charitable foundations|philanthropic endowment]] in the world; it has since been surpassed but still remains in the top ten.<ref name=us>{{cite web|accessdate=2009-04-10|url=http://foundationcenter.org/findfunders/topfunders/top100assets.html|title=Top 100 U.S. Foundations by Asset Size |publisher=Foundation Center }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://learningtogive.org/papers/paper153.html|author=Ivcevich, Kelly A|title=Lilly Endowment|publisher=[[The LEAGUE (nonprofit)|Community League]]|accessdate=2009-04-10}}</ref> The company played an important role in delivering medicine to the victims of the devastating [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake]].<ref name = is/> Lilly's company has since grown into one of the most important pharmaceutical companies in the world, and under Lilly<U+2019>s grandson's leadership developed many new innovations, including  pioneering and developing insulin during the 1920s, the mass production of [[penicillin]] during the 1940s,  and the general promotion of advancements in the mass production of medicines. Innovation continued at the company after it went public as it developed [[Humulin]], [[Merthiolate]], [[Prozac]], and many other medicines.<ref name = p60/> The company was made a public corporation in 1952.<ref name = is/> According to [[Forbes]], Eli Lilly & Co. was the 229th largest company in the world and 152nd in the United States in 2007, and worth of $17 billion ([[USD]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?sedol=2516152| title=Eli Lilly & Company (NYSE: LLY) At A Glance| publisher=[[Forbes]]| accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> It is the largest corporation and the largest charitable benefactor in Indiana.<ref name = is/><ref name = p58/>

Lilly's greatest contributions were his standardized and methodical creation of drugs, his dedication to research and development, and the actual value of the drugs he created. He pioneered the modern pharmaceutical industry, and many of his innovations later became standard practice. His ethical reforms, in a trade that was marked by ridiculous claims of miracle medicines,  began a period of rapid advancement in the development of medicinal drugs. Lilly and his company  advocated for federal regulation on medicines led to the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in 1906.<ref>Peckham, p. 116</ref><ref name = is/>

The [[Colonel Eli Lilly Civil War Museum]], located in the basement of the Indiana Sailor and Soldier Monument in Indianapolis is named in Lilly's honor. It opened in October 1999 and features exhibits about [[Indiana in the American Civil War|Indiana during the war period]] and the war in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/iwm/2335.htm|title=Colonel Eli Lilly Civil War Museum|publisher=Indiana Historical Bureau|accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>
