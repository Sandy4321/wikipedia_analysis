The '''Witham Shield''' is an [[Iron Age]] decorative bronze shield facing of [[La T<U+00E8>ne culture|La T<U+00E8>ne]] style, dating from about the 4th century BC. The shield was discovered in the [[River Witham]] in the vicinity of [[Washingborough]] and [[Fiskerton, Lincolnshire|Fiskerton]] in [[Lincolnshire]] in 1826. Further excavations at a nearby site have revealed posts interpreted as the foundation for a causeway, as well as artefacts including a sword, spears and part of a human skull with a sword fragment lodged within. The shield now resides in the [[British Museum]].<ref name="bm">[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_witham_shield.aspx Witham Shield], accessed August 2010</ref>

==Appearance==
The Witham Shield is an example of the style of [[Celtic art]] known as La T<U+00E8>ne. The bronze facings shows evidence of having been reworked. The most noticable feature is the central dome which would have been required for functional reasons as it allowed the owner to hold the shield close to its centre of gravity.  Originally a leather silhouette of a long-legged [[wild boar]] would have been rivetted to the shield around the central dome, as indicated by small rivet holes and staining of the shield.<ref name="bm"/>  The pattern of discolouration was very clear when the shield was recovered from the River Witham (see 1863 drawing below). Although it is still possible to see the discolouration under certain lighting conditions, the boar design is no longer easy to make out. The boar may have been a tribal emblem or represented the prowess of the shield's owner, but could also have been a representation of the Celtic god [[Moccus]].<ref>J. B. Whitwell, ''The Coritani: some aspects of the Iron Age tribe and the Roman civitas'' (B.A.R., 1982), p. 10</ref> The shield also has a number of birds and animals incorporated into the design. The roundels at each end are inspired by the heads of birds, which are supported by horses with wings for ears. Birds similar to [[Great Crested Grebe|crested grebes]] are engraved on the central spine and this completes the engraving work elsewhere.<ref name="megaw">[http://books.google.com/books?id=HXpwRkQybekC&pg=PA59&dq=%22witham+shield%22+museum&hl=en&ei=QIBpTMzlLNWSOJyWxbkF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Early Celtic Art in Britain''], Ruth and Vincent Megaw, p.29, accessed 16 August 2010</ref>

==Construction==
The shield was made principally from wood, now perished, to a design later known as a "Gaulish Shield" that originated in the seventh century BC.<ref name="jope"/> What remains is an almost complete facing that had been made to cover its surface. The sheeting is 0.2-0.3 mm thick and was designed to be applied to a wooden backing estimated at 8 mm thick. There are two main sheets that meet at the the mid point of the shield. Each of these sheets is just over one metre long. The join is not neat, and it is hidden from view by a covering strip. The shield is decorated with a central spindle boss, on which are pieces of red coral that are thought to have come from the Mediterranean area.<ref name="jope">[http://www.jstor.org/pss/4423072 "The Witham Shield"], E. M. Jope, ''British Museum Quarterly'', Vol. 35, No. 1/4 (Spring, 1971), pp. 61-69, [[British Museum]], accessed 16 August 2010</ref>

==Importance==
The shield has been descibed as a "tour de force" of beaten bronze work. There are no other complete bronze facings that survive in Europe. This is partially due to their rarity, as Celtic shields were normally constructed from unsheathed wood. The idea of covering a shield with bronze is a mark of Greek or Etruscan influence.<ref name="jope"/> The shield is comparable with other shields found in Britain dating from the same period, such as the [[Chertsey Shield]] and the [[Battersea Shield]] which were also found in rivers. The British Museum consider this shield to be "one of the best examples of the way British craftspeople adopted the new style of La T<U+00E8>ne art".<ref name="bm"/>

==Ownership==
The shield entered the collection of Sir [[Samuel Rush Meyrick]] (1783<U+2013>1848), a noted collector of arms and armour, and after his death the shield was purchased by [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|Augustus Franks]], an independently wealthy antiquarian who worked for the British Museum. In 1872 Franks presented the shield to the British Museum, one of over 20,000 objects that he donated to the museum during his lifetime or by bequest at his death.<ref>[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_results.aspx?queryAll=People%2f!!%2fOR%2f!!%2f148562%2f!%2f148562-3-9%2f!%2fDonated+by+Sir+Augustus+Wollaston+Franks%2f!%2f%2f!!%2f%2f!!!%2f&allCurrentPage=1 Objects donated by Sir Augustus Wollaston Franks].

==Related finds==
In the 20th century a series of posts were found together with an early to mid Iron Age [[sword]] when a [[Ditch|dyke]] was being cleaned near [[Fiskerton]], near where the Witham Shield had been found. Excavations in 1981 revealed the posts to be a wooden [[causeway]] which [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] dated to a period between 457 and 300 BC. It appeared to have been repaired and added to every eighteen years or so during that period, even though the construction and maintenance of a walkway on such a scale at that time would have been a major feat of engineering.  Hundreds of artifacts were also found around the causeway, including eleven [[spear]]s, six swords, woodworking and metalworking tools, as well as part of a [[human skull]] which had a crescent-shaped chop mark, probably inflicted by a sword; this injury is unlikely to have killed the man.<ref>Field, Naomi and Pearson, Mike Parker, 2003  ''Fiskerton: An Iron Age Timber Causeway with Iron Age and Roman Votive Offerings'', (Oxbow Books, Oxford). </ref>

Twenty years later, during further excavations at the site, more sections of the causeway were dug out, some of them containing posts several metres long, plus a complete spear, a [[currency bar]]<!--a silver ingot?-->, a sword, a [[dagger]] and some bronze fittings, all of which appeared to have been deliberately<!--does Kennedy imply ritually?--> damaged before their burial.<ref name="kennedy">Kennedy, Anra.

Accessed 24 November 2009</ref> The most important discovery was two Iron Age [[votive]] boats. One of these boats, as well as other artifacts from the site, can be seen at [[The Collection (Lincolnshire)|The Collection]] in Lincoln. The area around the site of the causeway was opened as a [[nature reserve]] managed by the [[Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust]] in 2006.
