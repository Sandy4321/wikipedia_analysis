The '''Torah''' ({{IPA-en|<U+02C8>t<U+0254><U+02D0>r<U+0259>}}; {{lang-he-n|<U+05EA><U+05BC><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05E8><U+05B8><U+05D4>}}, "Instruction", "Teaching") is the Jewish name for the first five books of the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]]. In Hebrew the five books are named by the [[Incipit|first phrase]] in the text: [[Bereshit]] ("In the beginning," [[Book of Genesis]]), [[Shemot]] ("Names," [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]), [[Vayikra]] ("He called", [[Leviticus]]<ref>Chaim Miller ''The Gutnick Edition Chumash - the Book of Leviticus'' Page 1 2005 "... Vayikra means <U+201C>He called,<U+201D> as in the opening verse of our Parsha, <U+201C>He called to Moshe.<U+201D>  "</ref>), [[Bamidbar]] ("In the desert," [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]) and [[Devarim]] ("Words," [[Deuteronomy]]). In [[rabbinic literature]] the word Torah denotes both these five books, ''Torah Shebichtav'' (<U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D4> <U+05E9><U+05D1><U+05DB><U+05EA><U+05D1>, "Torah that is written"), and an [[Oral Torah]], ''Torah Shebe'al Peh'' (<U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D4> <U+05E9><U+05D1><U+05E2><U+05DC> <U+05E4><U+05D4>, "Torah that is spoken"). The Oral Torah consists of the traditional interpretations and amplifications handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation and now embodied in the [[Talmud]] (<U+05EA><U+05B7><U+05BC><U+05DC><U+05B0><U+05DE><U+05D5><U+05BC><U+05D3>) and [[Midrash]] (<U+05DE><U+05D3><U+05E8><U+05E9><U+200E>) .<ref name="Jewish Concepts 1964, page 630">Birnbaum (1979), p. 630</ref>

According to Jewish tradition, all of the laws found in the Torah, both written and oral, were given by God to Moses, some of them at [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] and most of them at the Tabernacle, and all the teachings were later compiled and written down by Moses, which resulted in the Torah we have today. According to medieval [[Jewish mysticism]] the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the [[blueprint]] for [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]].<ref>Vol. 11 Trumah Section 61</ref> Most Modern biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exilic]] period (c.600&nbsp;BCE) and that it was completed by the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian period]] (c.400&nbsp;BCE).<ref>page 1, {{Cite book|last=Blenkinsopp|first=Joseph|title=The Pentateuch: An introduction to the first five books of the Bible|location=New York|publisher=Doubleday|year=1992|isbn=0-385-41207-X|series=[[Anchor Bible Series|Anchor Bible]] Reference Library}}</ref>

==Meaning and names==
[[File:ReadingOfTheTorah.jpg|thumb|Reading of the Torah]]
The word "Torah" in [[Biblical_Hebrew|Hebrew]] is derived from the root <U+05D9><U+05E8><U+05D4> which in the ''[[hifil]]'' [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] means "to teach" (cf. [[Leviticus|Lev]]. 10:11). The meaning of the word is therefore "teaching," "doctrine," or "instruction"; the commonly accepted "law" gives a wrong impression.<ref name="EJ">Rabinowitz, Louis Isaac and Harvey, Warren.  "Torah." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 20. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. pp 39<U+2013>46.</ref> Other translational contexts in the English language include [[Tradition|custom]], [[theory]], [[guidance]],{{Disambiguation needed|date=August 2011}}<ref>[[Philip Birnbaum]], ''Encyclopedia of Jewish Concepts'', Hebrew Publishing Company, 1964, page 630</ref> or [[system]].<ref>p.2767, Alcalay</ref>

The Hebrew word for law is ''din''. The term "Torah" is therefore also used in the general sense to include both [[Judaism]]'s written law and [[Oral Torah|oral law]], serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative [[Jew]]ish religious teachings throughout history, including the [[Mishnah]], the Talmud, the Midrash and more, and the inaccurate rendering of "Torah" as "Law"<ref>pp.164<U+2013>165, Scherman, Exodus 12:49</ref> may be an obstacle to "understanding the ideal that is summed up in the term ''talmud torah'' (<U+05EA><U+05DC><U+05DE><U+05D5><U+05D3> <U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D4>, "study of Torah").<ref name="Jewish Concepts 1964, page 630" />

The earliest name for the first part of the Bible seems to have been "The Torah of Moses." This title, however, is found neither in the Torah itself, nor in the works of the [[Babylonian Exile|pre-Exilic]] literary prophets. It appears in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] (8:31<U+2013>32; 23:6) and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (I Kings 2:3; II Kings 14:6; 23:25), but it cannot be said to refer there to the entire corpus. In contrast, there is every likelihood that its use in the post-Exilic works (Mal. 3:22; Dan. 9:11, 13; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh. 8:1; II Chron. 23:18; 30:16) was intended to be comprehensive. Other early titles were "The Book of Moses" (Ezra 6:18; Neh. 13:1; II Chron. 35:12; 25:4; cf. II Kings 14:6) and "The Book of the Torah" (Neh. 8:3) which seems to be a contraction of a fuller name, "The Book of the Torah of God" (Neh. 8:8, 18; 10:29<U+2013>30; cf. 9:3).<ref name="sarna">Sarna, Nahum M.

Scholars usually refer to the first five books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the ''Pentateuch'', a term first used in the [[Hellenistic Judaism]] of [[Alexandria]],<ref>The World and the Word: An Introduction to the Old Testament p163 ed. Eugene H. Merrill, Mark Rooker, Michael A. Grisanti - 2011 "Part 4 THE PENTATEUCH Michael A.

Muslims refer to the Torah as ''[[Tawrat]]'' ({{lang|ar|<U+062A><U+0648><U+0631><U+0627><U+0629>}}, "Law"), an Arabic word for the revelations given to the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] ''[[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]]'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0645><U+0648><U+0633><U+0649>}}, Moses in Arabic).

==Structure==
{{Books of Torah}}

The Hebrew names of the five books of the Torah are known by their [[incipit]], taken from initial words of the first verse of each book. For example, the Hebrew name of the first book, ''Bereshit'', is the first word of [[Genesis 1:1]]:

# ''Bereshit'' ({{hebrew|<U+05D1><U+05B0><U+05BC><U+05E8><U+05B5><U+05D0><U+05E9><U+05B4><U+05C1><U+05D9><U+05EA>}}, literally "In the beginning")
# ''Shemot'' ({{hebrew|<U+05E9><U+05B4><U+05C1><U+05DE><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05EA>}}, literally "Names")
# ''Vayikra'' ({{hebrew|<U+05D5><U+05D9><U+05E7><U+05E8><U+05D0>}}, literally "And He called")
# ''B<U+0259>midbar'' ({{hebrew|<U+05D1><U+05DE><U+05D3><U+05D1><U+05E8>}}, literally "In the desert [of]")
# ''Devarim'' ({{hebrew|<U+05D3><U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05D9><U+05DD>}}, literally "Things" or "Words")

The [[anglicize]]d names are derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] and reflect the essential theme of each book:

# [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]: "creation"
# [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]: "departure"
# [[Leviticus]]: refers to the [[Levites]] and the regulations that apply to their presence and service in the [[Temple]], which form the bulk of the third book.
# [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] (''Arithmoi''): contains a record of the numbering of the Israelites in the wilderness of [[Sinai]] and later on the plain of [[Moab]].
# [[Deuteronomy]]: "second law," refers to the fifth book's recapitulation of the [[mitzvot|commandments]] reviewed by Moses before his death.

According to the [[Oral tradition]], the prose in the Torah is not always in chronological order. Sometimes it is ordered by concept according to the rule: "There is not 'earlier' and 'later' in the Torah" (<U+05D0><U+05D9><U+05DF> <U+05DE><U+05D5><U+05E7><U+05D3><U+05DD> <U+05D5><U+05DE><U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05D7><U+05E8> <U+05D1><U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D4>, ''Ein mukdam u'meuchar baTorah'').<ref>[[Talmud]] [[Pesachim]] 7a</ref>  This position is accepted by Orthodox Judaism.  Non-Orthodox Jews generally understand the same texts as signs that the current text of the Torah was redacted from earlier sources (see [[documentary hypothesis]].) 

===Contents===
''[[Book of Genesis|Bereshit]]'' (Genesis) begins with the so-called "primeval history" (Genesis 1<U+2013>11), the story of the world's beginnings and the descent of Abraham. This is followed by the story of the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] ([[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]), [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] (Genesis 12<U+2013>50) and the four matriarchs ([[Sarah]], [[Rebecca|Rebekah]], [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]]). God gives to the patriarchs a promise of the land of [[Canaan]], but at the end of Genesis the sons of Jacob end up leaving Canaan for Egypt.

[[Book of Exodus|Shemot]] (Exodus) begins the story of God's revelation to his people Israel through [[Moses]], who leads them out of Egypt (Exodus 1<U+2013>18) to [[Mount Sinai]]. There the people accept a covenant with God, agreeing to be his people in return for agreeing to abide by his Law. Moses receives the Torah from God, and mediates His laws and Covenant (Exodus 19<U+2013>24) to the people of Israel. Exodus also deals with the first violation of the covenant when the [[Golden Calf]] was constructed (Exodus 32<U+2013>34). Exodus concludes with the instructions on building the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] (Exodus 25<U+2013>31; 35<U+2013>40).

[[Leviticus|Vayikra]] (Leviticus) begins with instructions to the Israelites on how to use the [[Tabernacle]], which they had just built (Leviticus 1<U+2013>10). This is followed by rules of [[Tumah and taharah|clean and unclean]] (Leviticus 11<U+2013>15), which includes the laws of slaughter and animals permissible to eat (see also: [[Kashrut]]), the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] (Leviticus 16), and various moral and ritual laws sometimes called the [[Holiness Code]] (Leviticus 17<U+2013>26).

[[Book of Numbers|Bamidbar]] (Numbers) tells how Israel consolidated itself as a community at Sinai (Numbers 1<U+2013>9), set out from Sinai to move towards Canaan and spied out the land (Numbers 10<U+2013>13). Because of unbelief at various points, but especially at Kadesh Barnea (Numbers 14), the Israelites were condemned to wander for forty years in the desert in the vicinity of Kadesh instead of immediately entering the land of promise. Even Moses sins and is told he would not live to enter the land (Numbers 20). At the end of Numbers (Numbers 26<U+2013>35) Israel moves from Kadesh to the plains of Moab opposite [[Jericho]], ready to enter the Promised Land.

[[Deuteronomy|Devarim]] (Deuteronomy) is a series of speeches by [[Moses]] on the plains of Moab opposite Jericho. Moses proclaims the Law (Deuteronomy 12<U+2013>26), gives instruction concerning covenant renewal at Shechem (Deuteronomy 27<U+2013>28) and gives Israel new laws (the "[[Deuteronomic Code]])".<ref>Coogan, Michael D. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context. Oxford University Press, 2009. pages 148<U+2013>149</ref>  At the end of the book (Deuteronomy 34) Moses is allowed to see the promised land from a mountain, but it is not known what happened to Moses on the mountain.  He was never seen again.  Knowing that he is nearing the end of his life, Moses appoints [[Joshua]] his successor, bequeathing to him the mantle of leadership.  Soon afterwards Israel begins the conquest of Canaan.

==Torah and Judaism==
{{Judaism}}
The Torah is the primary holy scripture of [[Judaism]].

[[Rabbi]]nic writings offer various ideas on when the Torah was composed. The revelation to Moses at [[Mount Sinai]] is considered by most to be the revelatory event.  According to dating of the text by Orthodox [[rabbi]]s, this occurred in 1312&nbsp;BCE;<ref name=Timeline>[http://www.aish.com/jl/h/48944541.html History Crash Course #36: Timeline: From Abraham to Destruction of the Temple], by Rabbi Ken Spiro, Aish.com. Retrieved 2010-08-19.</ref> another date given for this event is 1280&nbsp;BCE.<ref name=Kurzweil11>{{cite book |title=The Torah For Dummies |last=Kurzweil |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Kurzweil |year=2008 |publisher=For Dummies |isbn=978-0-470-28306-6 |page=11 |url=http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/59/04701734/0470173459.pdf |accessdate=2010-08-19 }}</ref>

Some rabbinic sources state that the entire Torah was given all at once at this event. In the maximalist belief, this dictation included not only the quotations that appear in the text, but every word of the text itself, including phrases such as "And God spoke to Moses&nbsp;...", and included God telling Moses about Moses' own death and subsequent events.  Other classical rabbinic sources{{Which?|date=March 2011}} hold that the Torah was revealed to Moses over many years, and finished only at his death.

Another rabbinic school of thought holds that although Moses wrote the vast majority of the Torah, the last four verses of the Torah must have been written after his death by Joshua. [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] and [[Joseph Bonfils]] observed{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that some phrases in the Torah present information that people should only have known after the time of Moses. Ibn Ezra hinted, and Bonfils explicitly stated, that Joshua (or perhaps some later prophet) wrote these sections of the Torah. Other rabbis would not accept this belief.

The [[Talmud]] (tractate Sabb. 115b) states that a peculiar section in the Book of Numbers (10:35 <U+2014> 36, surrounded by [[Inverted nun|inverted]] Hebrew letter nuns) in fact forms a separate book. On this verse a midrash on the book of ''Mishle'' (English [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]]) states that "These two verses stem from an independent book which existed, but was suppressed!" Another (possibly earlier) midrash, Ta'ame Haserot Viyterot, states that this section actually comes from the book of prophecy of [[Eldad and Medad]]. The Talmud says that God dictated four books of the Torah, but that Moses wrote Deuteronomy in his own words ([[Talmud#Talmud Bavli (Babylonian Talmud)|Talmud Bavli]], Meg. 31b).

All classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely or almost entirely Mosaic and of divine origin.<ref>For more information on these issues from an Orthodox Jewish perspective, see ''Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations'', Ed. [[Shalom Carmy]], and ''Handbook of Jewish Thought'', Volume I, by [[Aryeh Kaplan]].</ref>

===Ritual use===
[[File:Toras in Istanbul Ashkenazi Sinagogue.JPG|160px|left|thumb|Torahs in [[Ashkenazi Synagogue]] ([[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]])]]{{Main|Torah reading}}
Torah reading ({{Hebrew Name 1|<U+05E7><U+05E8><U+05D9><U+05D0><U+05EA> <U+05D4><U+05EA><U+05D5><U+05E8><U+05D4>|K'riat HaTorah|"Reading [of] the Torah"}}) is a Jewish religious [[ritual]] that involves the public reading of a set of passages from a [[Sefer Torah|Torah scroll]].  The term often refers to the entire ceremony of removing the [[Torah scroll]] (or scrolls) from the [[ark (synagogue)|ark]], chanting the appropriate excerpt with special [[cantillation]], and returning the scroll(s) to the ark. It is distinct from academic [[Torah study]].

Regular public reading of the Torah was introduced by [[Ezra]] the Scribe after the return of the Jewish people from the [[Babylonian captivity]] (c. 537&nbsp;BCE), as described in the [[Book of Nehemiah]].<ref>Book of Nehemia, [http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35b08.htm Chapter 8]</ref>  In the modern era, adherents of Orthodox Judaism practice Torah reading according to a set procedure they believe has remained unchanged in the two thousand years since the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] (70&nbsp;CE).  In the 19th and 20th centuries CE, new movements such as [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]] have made adaptations to the practice of Torah reading, but the basic pattern of Torah reading has usually remained the same:

As a part of the morning or afternoon prayer services on certain days of the week or holidays, a section of the [[Pentateuch]] is read from a Torah scroll.  On [[Shabbat]] (Saturday) mornings, a weekly section ("''[[parasha]]''") is read, selected so that the entire Pentateuch is read consecutively each year.<ref>The division of ''parashot'' found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in [[Mishneh Torah]], ''Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls'', chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the ''parashot'' for the Torah on the [[Aleppo Codex]].  Though initially doubted by [[Umberto Cassuto]], this has become the established position in modern scholarship. (See the [[Aleppo Codex]] article for more information.)</ref><ref>[[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] synagogues may read ''parashot'' on a triennial rather than annual schedule, [http://www.uscj.org/The_Authentic_Trienn7085.html ''The Authentic Triennial Cycle: A Better Way to Read Torah?''], [http://urj.org/worship/letuslearn/s7bechol/]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref>  On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays, the beginning of the following Saturday's portion is read. On [[Jewish holiday]]s, the beginnings of each month, and [[ta'anit|fast days]], special sections connected to the day are read.

Jews observe an annual holiday, [[Simchat Torah]], to celebrate the completion of the year's cycle of readings.

Torah scrolls are often dressed with a sash, a special [[Jeanette Kuvin Oren|Torah cover]], various ornaments and a Keter (crown), although such customs vary among synagogues.
Congregants traditionally stand when the Torah is brought out of the ark to be read, while it is being carried, and lifted, and likewise while it is returned to the ark, although they sit during the reading itself.

===Biblical law===
{{See also|Biblical law}}

The Torah contains narratives, statements of law, and statements of ethics. Collectively these laws, usually called [[biblical law]] or commandments, are sometimes referred to as the '''Law of Moses''' (''Torat Moshe'' {{hebrew|<U+05EA><U+05BC><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05E8><U+05B7><U+05EA><U+05BE><U+05DE><U+05B9><U+05E9><U+05B6><U+05C1><U+05D4>}}), or '''Mosaic Law'''. Moses received all the laws of God on Mount Sinai. These laws were the first part of the Torah.

==The Torah and Judaism's oral law==
{{See also|Oral Torah}}

Rabbinic tradition holds that the written Torah was transmitted in parallel with the [[oral tradition]]. Where the Torah leaves words and concepts undefined, and mentions procedures without explanation or instructions, the reader is required to seek out the missing details from supplemental sources known as the oral law or oral Torah.<ref>[http://jewishinspiration.com/tape.php?tape_id=33 Rietti, Rabbi Jonathan. The Oral Law: The Heart of The Torah]</ref> Some of the Torah's most prominent commandments needing further explanation are:

*[[Tefillin]]: As indicated in Deuteronomy 6:8 among other places, tefillin are to be placed on the arm and on the head between the eyes.  However, there are no details provided regarding what tefillin are or how they are to be constructed.
*[[Kashrut]]: As indicated in Exodus 23:19 among other places, a kid may not be boiled in its mother's milk. [A kid being a young goat.]  In addition to numerous other problems with understanding the ambiguous nature of this law, there are no vowelization characters in the Torah; they are provided by the oral tradition.  This is particularly relevant to this law, as the Hebrew word for ''milk'' (<U+05D7><U+05DC><U+05D1>) is identical to the word for ''animal fat'' when vowels are absent.  Without the oral tradition, it is not known whether the violation is in mixing meat with milk or with fat.
*[[Shabbat]] laws: With the severity of Sabbath violation, namely the death penalty, one would assume that direction would be provided as to how exactly such a serious and core commandment should be upheld.  However, there is little to no information as to what can and cannot be performed on the Sabbath.  Without the oral tradition, keeping this law would be impossible.

According to classical rabbinic texts this parallel set of material was originally transmitted to Moses at Sinai, and then from Moses to Israel. At that time it was forbidden to write and publish the oral law, as any writing would be incomplete and subject to misinterpretation and abuse.

However, after exile, dispersion and  persecution, this tradition was lifted when it became apparent that in writing was the only way to ensure that the Oral Law could be preserved. After many years of effort by a great number of [[tannaim]], the oral tradition was written down around 200&nbsp;CE by Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law, the [[Mishnah]] ([[Hebrew]]: <U+05DE><U+05E9><U+05E0><U+05D4>). Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as "Baraitot" (external teaching), and the [[Tosefta]]. Other traditions were written down as [[Midrashim]].

After continued persecution more of the oral law was committed to writing. A great many more lessons, lectures and traditions only alluded to in the few hundred pages of Mishnah, became the thousands of pages now called the ''[[Gemara]]''. Gemara is written in Aramaic, having been compiled in Babylon. The Mishnah and Gemara together are called the [[Talmud]]. The Rabbis in Israel also collected their traditions and compiled them into the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. Since the greater number of Rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict.

Orthodox Jews and Conservative Jews accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent halakha and codes of Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist Jews deny that these texts may be used for determining normative law (laws accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history.

==Divine significance of letters, Jewish mysticism==
{{See|Kabbalah}}
Kabbalists hold that not only are the words giving a Divine message, but indicate a far greater message that extends beyond them. Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a ''kotzo shel yod'' (<U+05E7><U+05D5><U+05E6><U+05D5> <U+05E9><U+05DC> <U+05D9><U+05D5><U+05D3>), the [[serif]] of the Hebrew letter ''[[Yodh|yod]]'' (<U+05D9>), the smallest letter, or decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase "I am the Lord thy God" ({{hebrew|<U+05D0><U+05B8><U+05E0><U+05B9><U+05DB><U+05B4><U+05D9> <U+05D9><U+05B0><U+05D4><U+05D5><U+05B8><U+05D4> <U+05D0><U+05B1><U+05DC><U+05B9><U+05D4><U+05B6><U+05D9><U+05DA><U+05B8>}}, Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in "And God spoke unto Moses saying" ({{hebrew|<U+05D5><U+05B7><U+05D9><U+05B0><U+05D3><U+05B7><U+05D1><U+05B5><U+05BC><U+05E8> <U+05D0><U+05B1><U+05DC><U+05B9><U+05D4><U+05B4><U+05D9><U+05DD>, <U+05D0><U+05B6><U+05DC>-<U+05DE><U+05B9><U+05E9><U+05B6><U+05C1><U+05D4>; <U+05D5><U+05B7><U+05D9><U+05B9><U+05BC><U+05D0><U+05DE><U+05B6><U+05E8> <U+05D0><U+05B5><U+05DC><U+05B8><U+05D9><U+05D5>, <U+05D0><U+05B2><U+05E0><U+05B4><U+05D9> <U+05D9><U+05B0><U+05D4><U+05D5><U+05B8><U+05D4>.}} Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, [[Rabbi Akiva]] (ca.50<U+2013>ca.135CE), is said to have learned a new law from every ''et'' (<U+05D0><U+05EA>) in the Torah ([[Talmud]], tractate Pesachim 22b); the word ''et'' is meaningless by itself, and serves only to mark the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]]. In other words, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] belief is that even apparently contextual text "And God spoke unto Moses saying&nbsp;..." is no less important than the actual statement.

One [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] interpretation is that the Torah constitutes one long name of God, and that it was broken up into words so that human minds can understand it. While this is effective since it accords with our human reason, it is not the only way that the text can be broken up.

==Production and use of a Torah scroll==

[[File:Page Pointers for reading of Torah.jpg|thumb|Page pointers for reading of the Torah]]

{{Main|Sefer Torah}}
[[Manuscript]] Torah [[scroll]]s are still used, and still scribed, for ritual purposes (i.e., [[Jewish services|religious services]]); this is called a ''[[Sefer Torah]]'' ("Book [of] Torah"). They are written using a painstakingly careful methodology by highly qualified scribes. This has resulted in modern copies of the text that are unchanged from millennia-old copies. It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning, and that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the 304,805 stylized letters which make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.

According to Jewish law, a ''sefer Torah'' (plural: ''Sifrei Torah'') is a copy of the formal Hebrew text of hand-written on ''[[gevil]]'' or ''[[qlaf]]'' (forms of [[parchment]]) by using a [[quill]] (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink.  Written entirely in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a ''sefer Torah'' contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained ''[[sofer (scribe)|sofer]]'' (<U+201C>scribe<U+201D>), an effort which may take as long as approximately one and a half years.  Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] are observed. See for example the [[Mishna Berura]] on the subject.<ref>[http://www.geniza.net/ritual/mb/letterforms.shtml Mishnat Soferim The forms of the letters] translated by Jen Taylor Friedman (geniza.net)</ref> Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.

The completion of the sefer Torah is a cause for great celebration, and it is a [[Mitzvah]] for every Jew to either write or have written for him a Sefer Torah.  Torah scrolls are stored in the [[holy|holiest]] part of the [[synagogue]] in the [[Ark (synagogue)|Ark]] known as the "Holy Ark" ({{hebrew|<U+05D0><U+05B2><U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05DF> <U+05D4><U+05E7><U+05B9><U+05D3><U+05E9><U+05C1>}} ''aron hakodesh'' in Hebrew.) Aron in Hebrew means "cupboard" or "closet", and kodesh is derived from "kadosh", or "holy".

==In other religions==
{{See also|Biblical law in Christianity|Islam and Judaism|Tawrat}}

While [[Christianity]] includes the five books of Moses (the ''Pentateuch'') among their sacred texts, in its [[Old Testament]], [[Islam]] believes that only the original Torah was sent by the One true God. In both religions they lack the religious legal significance that they have in Orthodox Judaism.

Among [[early centers of Christianity]] a [[Koine Greek]] version of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was used by Greek speakers ([[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]] [[Targums]] were used by Aramaic speakers such as the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]). The Greek version's name in Latin is the [[Septuagint]]: L. ''septem'' meaning seven, plus ''-gint<U+0101>'' meaning "times ten". It was named ''Septuagint'' from the traditional number of its translators. This Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures dates from the 3rd century <small>B.C.</small>, originally associated with [[Hellenistic Judaism]]. It contains both a translation of the Hebrew and additional and variant material. It was regarded as the standard form of the Old Testament in the early Greek Christian Church and is still considered canonical in the Eastern Orthodox Church.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/septuagint Def. of Septuagint]</ref>
<ref>p.317, DeSilva</ref> Though different [[Christian denominations]] have slightly [[Development of the Old Testament canon|different versions]] of the Old Testament in their Bibles, the Torah as the "Five Books of Moses" (or "the [[Mosaic Law]]") is common among them all.

The [[Quran]] refers heavily to Moses to outline the truth of his existence and the religious guidelines that God (Most Exalted) had revealed to the Children of Israel. God (Most Exalted) says in the Qur'an, "It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)." [3:1]

Muslims call the Torah the ''[[Tawrat]]'' and consider it the word of God given to Moses. However, Muslims also believe that this original revelation was corrupted (''[[tahrif]]'') over time by Jewish scribes<ref>[http://www.ahmed-deedat.co.za/bible/07.html Is the Bible God's Word] by Sheikh Ahmed Deedat</ref> and hence do not revere the present "Jewish version" Torah as much. {{cite quran|7|144|end=144|expand=no|style=ref}} The Torah in the Qur'an is always mentioned with respect in Islam. The Muslims' belief in the Torah, as well as the prophethood of Moses, is one of the [[Six articles of belief|fundamental tenets]] of Islam.
