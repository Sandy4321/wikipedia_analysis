'''Amy Wyatt''' is a [[fictional character]] from the British soap opera ''[[Emmerdale]]'', played by [[Chelsea Halfpenny]]. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 8 October 2010. Since her inception Amy has been central to main storylines and has been played as the serial's rebellious teenager. Halfpenny has said she enjoys playing the character's mischievous side. Amy's unstable upbringing in children's homes and foster care has impacted on her persona. She is a troubled character and protects herself by creating a hard exterior around herself. Amy's biggest fear is embarrassment and she aspires to lead a normal family life with her foster parents [[Val Pollard|Val]] and [[Eric Pollard]]. As her storylines have developed she has grown close to the pair, yet rebelled at various stages in her duration. [[Charlie Hardwick]] and [[Chris Chittell]] who play Val and Eric have expressed their delight with the positive impact Amy has had on their on-screen family. She has a kooky style and wears heavy make-up.

Other stories for the character include blackmail, one night stands, heavy drinking and robberies. In 2011, the programme's series producer Stuart Blackburn devised a storyline to help viewers relate to Amy more. It began when Amy discovers she is pregnant with the serial's villain [[Cain Dingle]]. As the narrative progresses, Amy becomes ostracised as the fear of losing her new found family increases. Amy has received mixed reviews from critics. Jane Simon from the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said her first scenes resembled a horror movie, while her colleague Jaci Stephen has opined that Amy wears too much make-up. However, entertainment website [[Digital Spy]] has favoured many of her storylines. Halfpenny has been nominated for three "Best Newcomer" awards for her portrayal of Amy.

Series producer [[Gavin Blyth]] first mentioned Amy's arrival in June 2010.

Amy is a troubled character with a mischievous personality. As Amy grew up in care it shows in her persona.

Halfpenny also felt it was important that Amy stayed remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up to quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience.<ref name=change/> At times she is scared she puts on a "hard exterior".<ref>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Tony|title=Emmerdale: 'Amy's got this hard exterior but she's really scared'|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/tv/soap-news/2011/08/13/emmerdale-amy-s-got-this-hard-exterior-but-she-s-really-scared-115875-23341780/|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=20 August 2011|date=13 August 2011}}</ref> Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite "out there" in her choice of clothing and make-up.<ref name=change>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Emmerdale' star: 'Amy shouldn't change'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a314221/emmerdale-star-amy-shouldnt-change.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=19 August 2011|date=12 April 2011}}</ref> Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's "nice side" and reminded them that she is good at "lying and scheming".

===Adjusting to family life===
{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote="Underneath it all, Amy has a good heart. She could be a very nice girl if she was shown some real love and had some proper friends."<ref name=inside/>|source=<U+2014>Halfpenny on Amy (2011)}}
After Val and Eric foster Amy, she starts acting rebellious again. She starts drinking and throwing herself at men, forcing her foster parents to have second thoughts.<ref name=inside/> Halfpenny told ''[[Inside Soap]]'' that Amy goes off the rails because she is convinced everything goes wrong in her life. "She's afraid of getting hurt, so she spoils things for herself before anyone else can get there first." Halfpenny explained that Val's parental approach compared to Eric's was contrasting. Eric had not been around when his son [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden (actor)|Matthew Wolfenden]]) grew up, Halfpenny said this factor meant that Eric is not tolerant with Amy's bad behaviour. Though, Val had brought up her own children, her approach towards Amy is "light-hearted."<ref name=inside/> However, when Amy continues her alcohol binges, Val and Eric feel she has "gone too far" and "question their ability to cope with her." Served with an ultimatum, the character of Amy has to endure changes to remain with her new family. Halfpenny claimed the main change she had to make was "to keep her tongue in her own mouth and cool it down with the boys."<ref name=inside/>

Off-screen Wolfenden, Hardwick and Chittel were thrilled by Amy's inclusion. Wolfenden said Halfpenny's acting skill had "freshened the whole place up."<ref>{{cite web|title=Matthew Wolfenden: David and Leyla belong together|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/newsfeeds//11587/2011/04/13/matthew-wolfenden-david-and/|work=''[[Virginmedia.com]]''|publisher=([[Virgin Media]])|accessdate=20 August 2011|date=13 April 2011}}</ref> In comparison, David was initially hostile to Amy's inclusion in his family.<ref name=inside/> However, in one storyline his attitude towards her softens and results in Amy developing feelings for him.<ref name=all/> Wolfenden said David "has a soft spot for Amy" and flirted with her. Over time he began to see her as his "little sister." When David's girlfriend, [[Leyla Harding]] ([[Rokhsaneh Ghawam-Shahidi]]) accuses Amy of stealing from the shop, David proves her innocence by exposing [[Alicia Gallagher]] ([[Natalie Anderson]]) as the thief.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emmerdale's Alicia Gallagher to be left homless?|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/newsfeeds//11587/2011/04/11/emmerdale-alicia-gallagher-to/|work=''[[Virginmedia.com]]''|publisher=([[Virgin Media]])|accessdate=20 August 2011|date=11 April 2011}}</ref> Wolfenden added that David has given out the wrong signals and acted naive during the story arc.<ref name=all/> Wolfenden explained that Amy misreads the signs because "she never had that sort of affection when she was growing up." Amy kisses David which shocks him, though Wolfenden felt it should not surprise him. Amy lies to her best friend [[Victoria Sugden]] ([[Isabel Hodgins]]), claiming she has slept with him and runs away from home.<ref name=all>{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Carena|title=Brotherly love!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|date=2<U+2013>13 May 2011|issue=243|pages=30|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}</ref>

Halfpenny revealed that Amy genuinely liked David and thought the feeling was mutual. "She wouldn't do it to embarrass herself; i think that is one of Amy's biggest fears being embarrassed."<ref name=video/> When David tracks Amy down; she blackmails him in return for the truth. Though, David exposes her to Eric. Halfpenny said Amy was hurt by David's deception because she trusted him and despite their problems had a "good relationship". Eric tries to convince Amy to return home to lead the life she had always wanted, because "deep down he really cares about her." The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy "meeting her match." As "nothing is straight forward with Amy", she returns home but finds telling the truth hard.<ref name=video>{{cite web|title=Teen runaway - Amy Wyatt|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/extras/teen-runaway/|work=''[[itv.com]]''|publisher=([[ITV Plc]])|accessdate=20 August 2011|date=May 2011}}</ref> Amy settles into village life until [[Jared Haynes]] (Philip Hill-Pearson) arrives and blackmails Amy.

Amy's role in the serial increased with her much publicised pregnancy storyline. The plot begins when Amy has a "fling" with the programme's villain [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]).<ref name=cain/> Halfpenny said "It's Amy who takes the lead and it goes from there."<ref name=amm/> While, Hordley explained that Amy's attention inflates Cain's ego and he thinks "'aye, aye'. It's still young but in his book, he's like, 'wahey, I've still got it'." However, when he learns she is sixteen, "he feels incredibly stupid and "embarrassed."

As the storyline developed, it held the potential to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a "good place" and they think "Amy's all happy."
