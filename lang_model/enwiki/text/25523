The '''Gulf Stream''', together with its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], is a powerful, warm, and swift [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[ocean current]] that originates at the tip of Florida,  and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] before crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The process of [[Boundary current|western intensification]] causes the Gulf Stream to be a northward accelerating current off the east coast of North America. At about {{Coord|40|0|N|30|0|W}}, it splits in two, with the northern stream crossing to Northern Europe and the southern stream recirculating off West Africa.  The Gulf Stream influences the climate of the east coast of North America from Florida to Newfoundland, and the west coast of Europe.  Although there has been recent debate, there is consensus that the climate of Western Europe and Northern Europe is warmer than it would otherwise be due to the [[North Atlantic drift]], one of the branches from the tail of the Gulf Stream.  It is part of the [[North Atlantic Gyre]]. Its presence has led to the development of strong [[cyclone]]s of all types, both within the [[atmosphere]] and within the ocean. The Gulf Stream is also a significant potential source of [[renewable power]] generation.

[[Image:Franklingulfstream.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Benjamin Franklin]]'s map of the Gulf Stream]]
European discovery of the Gulf Stream dates to the 1512 expedition of [[Juan Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n]], after which it became widely used by Spanish ships sailing from the Caribbean to Spain.<ref>{{cite book |last= Fernandez-Armesto |first= Felipe |title= Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration |year= 2006 |publisher= W.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] became interested in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] circulation patterns. In 1768, while in England, Franklin heard a curious complaint from the Colonial Board of Customs: Why did it take British packets several weeks longer to reach New York from England than it took an average American merchant ship to reach [[Newport, Rhode Island]], despite the merchant ships leaving from London and having to sail down the [[River Thames]] and then the length of the [[English Channel]] before they sailed across the Atlantic, while the packets left from [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in Cornwall?<ref name=tuchman>[[Barbara W. Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara W.]] ''The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution'' New York: Ballantine Books, 1988. pp.221<U+2013>222.</ref>

Franklin asked Timothy Folger, his cousin twice removed (Nantucket Historical Society), a Nantucket whaling captain, for an answer. Folger explained that merchant ships routinely crossed the then-unnamed Gulf Stream<U+2014>identifying it by whale behavior, measurement of the water's temperature and the speed of bubbles on its surface, and changes in the water's color<U+2014>while the mail packet captains ran against it.<ref name=tuchman/> Franklin worked with Folger and other experienced ship captains, learning enough to chart the Gulf Stream and giving it the name by which it is still known today. He offered this information to Anthony Todd, secretary of the British Post Office, but it was ignored by British sea captains.<ref name=tuchman />

Franklin's Gulf Stream chart was published in 1770 in England, where it was mostly ignored.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studyofplace.info/ActivityContent/Materials/OceanCurrents_Reading_BenFranklinGulfStream.pdf |title=Ben Franklin and the Gulf Stream |last=Isserman |first=Maurice |year=2002 |work=Study of place |publisher=TERC |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> Subsequent versions were printed in France in 1778 and the U.S. in 1786.<ref name="Ocean explorer">{{cite web |url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/library/readings/gulf/gulf.html |title=1785: Benjamin Franklin's 'Sundry Maritime Observations' |author=Anon |work=Ocean Explorer: Readings for ocean explorers |publisher=NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research |accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref> It took many years for the British to follow Franklin's advice on navigating the current but once they did, they were able to gain two weeks in sailing time.<ref name="Ocean explorer"/>

The Gulf Stream proper is a [[Boundary current#Western intensification|western-intensified]] current, driven largely by wind stress.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wunsch |first=Carl |title=What Is the Thermohaline Circulation? |journal=Science |date=November 8, 2002 |pages=1179<U+2013>1181 |doi=10.1126/science.1079329 |volume=298 |issue=5596 |url=http://www.sciencefag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5596/1179 |pmid=12424356 }} (see also [http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/thc_fact_sheet.html Rahmstorf].)</ref> The [[North Atlantic current|North Atlantic Drift]], in contrast, is largely [[thermohaline circulation]]<U+2013>driven.

== Formation and behaviour ==
[[Image:Golfstream.jpg|thumb|275px|Evolution of the Gulf Stream to the west of Ireland continuing as the [[North Atlantic Current]]]]

A river of sea water, called the [[North Equatorial Current|Atlantic North Equatorial Current]], flows westward off the coast of northern Africa. When this current interacts with the northeastern coast of South America, the current forks into two branches. One passes into the [[Caribbean Sea]], while a second, the Antilles Current, flows north and east of the [[Caribbean|West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Elizabeth Rowe, Arthur J. Mariano, Edward H.

As a consequence, the resulting Gulf Stream is a strong ocean current. It transports water at a rate of 30 million cubic meters per second (30 [[sverdrup]]s) through the Florida Straits.  As it passes south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], this rate increases to 150 million cubic metres per second.<ref>{{cite web |author=Joanna Gyory, Arthur J. Mariano, Edward H.

It is weaker, however, than the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Ryan Smith, Melicie Desflots, Sean White, Arthur J. Mariano, Edward H.

The Gulf Stream is typically {{convert|100|km|mi}} wide and {{convert|800|m|ft}} to {{convert|1200|m|ft}} deep.  The current velocity is fastest near the surface, with the maximum speed typically about {{convert|2.5|m/s|mph}}.<ref>{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Pamela |title=The Gulf Stream |url=http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/student/phillips/ |publisher=USNA/Johns Hopkins |accessdate=2007-08-02 }}</ref>  As it travels north, the warm water transported by the Gulf Stream undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind-driven: Wind moving over the water causes [[evaporation]], cooling the water and increasing its [[salinity]] and density.  When sea ice forms, salts are left out of the ice, a process known as brine exclusion.<ref>{{cite web |last=Russel |first=Randy |title=Thermohaline Ocean Circulation |url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Water/thermohaline_ocean_circulation.html |publisher=University Corportation for Atmospheric Research |accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref>  These two processes produce water that is denser and colder (or, more precisely, water that is still liquid at a lower temperature). In the North Atlantic Ocean, the water becomes so dense that it begins to sink down through less salty and less dense water.
