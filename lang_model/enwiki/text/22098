==Plot==

Shirin is an absent-minded, yet sophisticated, young Iranian-American woman who lives in "Tehrangeles", the large Iranian community of Los Angeles. While Shirin has been engaged for years to a successful Iranian plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, she lives with her overbearing mother and empathetic father. When she falls in love with a mysterious young man who lives in a lighthouse in Northern California, a secret unravels and cultures clash, challenging all the tradition Shirin grew up with - and she re-discovers herself in the process.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Shirin in Love plot summary|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2040504/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl|publisher=imdb|accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>
