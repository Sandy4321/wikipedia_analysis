'''Ogden Kraut''' was an American author who wrote about his [[Mormon_fundamentalism#Independent_Mormon_fundamentalists|independent Mormon fundamentalist]] beliefs.<ref name="deseret1">{{cite news|date=2002-07-21|author=Associated Press|title=Author Ogden Kraut, 75, dies|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/926667/Author-Ogden-Kraut-75-dies.html?pg=all|quote=He wanted to be known as a "fundamentalist Mormon," said Anne Wilde, one of Kraut's wives. "He considered himself a Joseph Smith Mormon <U+2014> a follower of original Mormonism."}}</ref> He was set apart as a "[[Seventy_(Latter_Day_Saints)|Seventy]]" by [[Joseph W. Musser]], a leader of the early fundamentalist movement. He also served as a missionary in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He was one of the last missionaries to serve in the church "without purse or scrip" (financed entirely by donations from the church or from those to whom they taught), and wrote a book about his experiences. <ref>Quinn, <U+201C>Plural Marriage, 1998,<U+201D> 29.</ref>
He wrote books, some self-published, on Mormon fundamentalist topics. His ''95 Theses'', named after a document by [[Martin Luther]], includes specific charges against doctrinal changes in the Mormon Church.

Ogden Kraut was known to be keeping a distance from the emerging fundamentalist groups. He believed they had no authority to build their own churches and defended his independent lifestyle:
{{quote|1=
John Taylor authorized and set apart several men to perpetuate the principle of plural marriage and gave them the calling to perform such marriage, regardless of what the Church or the government might say or do...  There is no mention of setting up a church, taking tithing, having weekly meetings, or setting up a colony somewhere.  Their calling (or keys) was to (1) live plural marriage, (2) perform plural marriage sealings, and (3) set apart others with this same calling.<ref>Kraut, Holy Priesthood, 6:250,257</ref>}}

In 1972,<ref>{{cite news

In 1988, when a polygamist family [[John_Singer_(homeschooler)#1988_standoff|was in a stand-off]] with law enforcement agencies, Kraut, who was acquainted with the family, was permitted to bring them food and supplies. He carried letters between the governor and the polygamists. Authorities wished to counter public perceptions that they were employing "psychological warfare" and "siege tactics". In vain, they hoped that Kraut or the governor's letter would influence the outlaws to negotiate or surrender.<ref>{{cite news|date=1988-01-27|title=The Nation|author=(no byline)|publisher=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-27/news/mn-25863_1_ogden-kraut}}</ref><!-- no byline --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://site.utah.gov/dps/highwaypatrol/history_1989/marion.html|title=1980 - 1989 / Return to Marion|publisher=Utah Department of Public Safety}}</ref>
