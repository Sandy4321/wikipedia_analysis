'''Rice''' is two species in the [[Poaceae]] ("true grass") family, '''''Oryza sativa''''' and '''''Oryza glaberrima'''''.  These [[plants]] are native to tropical and subtropical southern and southeastern [[Asia]] and in [[Africa]]. Rice provides more than one fifth of the [[calorie]]s consumed by [[human]]s in their global diets.<ref>Smith, Bruce D. ''The Emergence of Agriculture''.  Scientific American Library, A Division of HPHLP, New York, 1998.</ref> (The term "wild rice" can refer to wild species of ''Oryza'', but conventionally refers to species of the related genus ''[[Zizania]]'', both wild and domesticated.) Rice is a [[monocarpic]] [[annual plant]], growing to 1<U+2013>1.8 m tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and [[soil]] fertility. The grass has long, slender [[leaf|leaves]] 50<U+2013>100 cm long and 2<U+2013>2.5 cm broad. The small [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] [[flower]]s are produced in a branched arching to pendulous [[inflorescence]] 30<U+2013>50 cm long. The [[seed]] is a [[grain]] (caryopsis) 5<U+2013>12 mm long and 2<U+2013>3 mm thick.

Rice is a [[staple food|staple]] for a large part of the world's [[human population]], especially in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], making it the most consumed [[cereal grain]]. Rice is the world's third largest crop, behind [[maize]] ("corn") and [[wheat]]. Rice [[cultivation]] is well-suited to countries and regions with low [[labour (economics)|labour]] costs and high [[rainfall]], as it is very labour-intensive to cultivate and requires plenty of water for [[irrigation]], much like the [[licorice]] crops found in Eastern Europe. Rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on [[grade (slope)|steep]] [[mountain|hill]]sides.  Although its species are native to South Asia and certain parts of [[Africa]], centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures.

==Growth==
{{main|Paddy field}}

Rice is often grown in [[paddy field|paddies]]. The shallow puddles take advantage of the rice plant's tolerance to water; the water in the paddies prevents [[weed]]s from outgrowing the crop. Once the rice has established dominance of the field, the water can be drained in preparation for harvest. Paddies increase productivity, although rice can also be grown on dry land (including on [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced hillsides]]) with the help of chemical weed controls. 

In some instances, a deep-water strain of rice often called ''floating rice'' is grown. Floating rice can develop elongated stems capable of coping with water depths exceeding 2 meters (6.5 feet).

Rice paddies are an important habitat for birds such as [[heron]]s and [[Old World warbler|warblers]], and a wide range of [[Amphibia|amphibians]] and [[snake]]s. They perform a useful function in controlling insect [[Pest (animal)|pests]] by providing useful habitats for those who prey on them.

Whether it is grown in paddies or on dry land, rice requires a great amount of water compared to other food crops. Rice growing is a controversial practice in some areas, particularly in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]], where some individuals claim it produces little GDP for the large amounts of water used to produce rice.  However, in nations that have a periodical [[rain season]] and [[typhoon]]s, rice paddies serve to keep the water supply steady and prevent [[flood]]s from reaching a dangerous level.

[[Rice blast]], caused by the [[fungus]] ''Magnaporthe grisea'', is the most significant disease affecting rice cultivation.

[[Image:RICE POLISHING BY FOOT POWER.jpg|thumb|left|Old fashioned way of rice polishing in [[Japan]].]]
The seeds of the rice plant are first milled using a [[rice huller]] to remove the [[chaff]] (the outer husks of the grain). At this point in the process the product is called [[brown rice]].  This process may be continued, removing the [[cereal germ|germ]] and the rest of the husk, called the [[bran]] at this point, creating [[white rice]]. The white rice may then be buffed with glucose or talc powder (often called ''polished rice,'' though this term may also refer to white rice in general), [[parboiled rice|parboiled]], or processed into [[flour]]. The white rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water insoluble substance which is resistant to washing. [[Image:Rice-fields-Indonesia-(Java).jpg|thumb|Terraced rice paddy on a hillslope]]

While washing is counter-productive for powder-enriched rice, it is absolutely necessary when talc-coated rice is used, not least because of concerns about the negative health effects of talc consumption and possibility of asbestos accompanying the talc.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}  Despite the hypothetical health risks of talc (such as stomach cancer), talc-coated rice remains the norm in some countries due to its attractive shiny appearance, but it has been banned in some and is no longer widely used in others such as the United States.  Even where talc is not used, glucose, starch, or other coatings may be used to improve the appearance of the grains; for this reason, many rice lovers still recommend washing all rice in order to create a better-tasting rice with a better consistency, despite the recommendation of suppliers. Much of the rices produced today are in fact water polished. 
[[Image:Rice milling.JPG|thumb|left|130px|Modern rice polishing machines]]
[[Rice bran]], called ''nuka'' in [[Japan]], is a valuable commodity in Asia and is used for many daily needs. It is a moist, oily inner layer which is heated to produce an oil. It is also used in making a kind of [[tsukemono|pickled]] vegetable.

The raw rice may be ground into [[flour]] for many uses, including making many kinds of [[beverage]]s such as [[amazake]], [[horchata]], [[rice milk]], and [[sake]].  Rice flour is generally safe for people on a [[gluten-free diet]]. Rice may also be made into various types of [[noodle]]s.

The processed rice seeds are usually boiled or steamed to make them edible, after which they may be fried in [[cooking oil|oil]] or [[butter]], or beaten in a tub to make [[mochi]].

{{nutritionalvalue | name=Rice, raw | opt1n=Water | opt1v=13 g | kJ=1506 | protein=7 g | fat=0.6 g | carbs=79 g | vitB6_mg=0.15 | right=1}}

Rice, like other [[cereal]] [[caryopsis|grains]], can be ''puffed'' (or ''popped''). This process takes advantage of the grains' [[water]] content and typically involves heating grain pellets in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing pre-puffed pellets in a low-[[pressure]] chamber.  The [[ideal gas law]] means that either lowering the local pressure or raising the water [[temperature]] results in an increase in [[volume]] prior to water [[evaporation]], resulting in a puffy [[texture]].

==Cooking==
{{selfref|See [[:Category:Rice dishes]] and [[wikibooks:Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Wikibooks' Rice Recipes]] for information on food preparation using rice.}}

[[Image:Rice p1160004.jpg|thumb|Uncooked pre-steamed long rice]]
Rice is cooked by [[boiling]] or [[steaming]]. It can be cooked in just enough water to cook it through, or it can be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving.  Electric [[rice cooker]]s, which are popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. 

Rice may also be made into [[Congee|rice porridge]] by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water to the point that it becomes very soft, expanded, and fluffy. [[Congee|Rice porridge]] is very easy to digest, so it is especially suitable for the sick.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Rice may be soaked prior to cooking. Soaked rice cooks faster. For some varieties, soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains.

In some culinary traditions, especially those of [[Latin America]], [[Italy]], and Turkey dry rice grains are [[fried]] in [[oil]] before cooking in water.

Much of todays rice is consumed as parboiled rice. Also known as easi-cook rice. Parboiled rice is subjected to a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice. This causes nutrients from the outer husk to move into the grain itself. The parboil process causes a gelatisisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the colour of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or consumed as brown rice. Milled parboil rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking as happens when cooking regular white rice. 

A nutritionally superior method of preparing brown rice known as '''GABA Rice''' or GBR (Germinated Brown Rice)<ref>Shoichi Ito and Yukihiro Ishikawa Tottori University, Japan. {{cite web | title=(Marketing of Value-Added Rice Products in Japan: Germinated Grown RIce and Rice Bread.) | url=http://www.hatsuga.com/DOMER/english/en/GBRRB.html | accessdate=February 12 | accessyear=2004 }}</ref> may be used. This involves soaking washed brown rice for 20 hours in warm water (38 [[degree Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] or 100 [[degree Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]) prior to cooking it. This process stimulates [[germination]], which [[activator|activates]] various [[enzymes]] in the rice. By this method, a result of research carried out for the [[United Nations]] Year of Rice, it is possible to obtain a more complete [[amino acid]] profile, including [[GABA]].

== History ==
[[Image:Riziere Oki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hiroshige|Utagawa Hiroshige]], ''Rice field in Oki province, view of O-Yama''.]]
===Etymology===

It is widely accepted that the term Rice comes from the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] word for rice ''Arisi''.  According to ''[[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta Dictionary]]'' (2004) and to ''[[Chambers Dictionary of Etymology]]'' (1988), the word ''rice'' has an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] origin. It came to [[English language|English]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''<U+00F3>ryza'', via [[Latin]] ''oriza'', [[Italian language|Italian]] ''riso'' and finally [[Old French]] ''ris'' (the same as present day [[French language|French]] ''riz'').
<br>The same Indo-Iranian origin produced the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''ar-ruzz'', from which the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''arroz'' originated.
[[Orzo]], a pasta shaped like small grains of rice, presumably gets its name from the Latin ''oriza''.

===Genetic History===
[[Image:RiceCloseUp.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Japan|Japanese]] short-grain rice]]
Rice cultivation is considered to have begun simultaneously in many countries over 6500 years ago. Two species of rice were [[domesticated]], Asian rice (''Oryza sativa'') and African rice (''Oryza glaberrima'').

Genetic studies suggest that common wild rice, ''[[Oryza rufipogon]]'', was the wild ancestor of Asian rice <ref>{{cite web | title=Status and Project of Studies on the Origin of the Chinese cultivated Rice, CHEN WENHUA (From Internet Archive)| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050307173352/http://station7.kgw.tu-berlin.de/english/abstracts/ChenW.html | accessdate=April 10 | accessyear=2006 }}</ref>.

According to Londo and Chiang, ''O. sativa'' appears to have originated around the [[foothills]] of the [[Himalayas]], with ''O. sativa'' var. ''indica'' on the [[India]]n side and [[Japanese rice|''O. sativa'' var. ''japonica'']] on the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Japan|Japanese]] side <ref>J.P. Londo, Y. Chiang et al, "Phylogeography of Asian wild rice, Oryza rufipogon, reveals multiple independent domestications of cultivated rice, Oryza sativa", PNAS 103(25):9578-83, 2006 ([http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0603152103v1])</ref>.

===East Asia===
[[Image:Coat_of_arms_of_Negeri_Sembilan.jpg|200px|thumb|The coat of arms of [[Negeri Sembilan]] that featured nine sheaves of paddy grains]]
The origins of rice cultivation is the object of research of specialized branch of [[archaeology]] called [[paleoethnobotany|palaeoethnobotany]]. Research in China is active, well reported, and there are a number of differing perspectives on when rice was [[domesticate|domesticated]], and when the intensive cultivation of domesticated rice first began. 

'''China'''

Z. Zhao, a Chinese palaeoethnobotanist, hypothesizes that people of the [[Late Pleistocene]] began to collect wild rice. Zhao explains that the collection of wild rice from an early date eventually led to its domestication and then the exclusive use of domesticated rice strains by circa 6400 B.C. at the latest (Zhao 1998). Stone tool evidence from the Yunchanyan site in [[Hunan]] province suggests the possibility that Early [[Neolithic]] groups cultivated rice as early as circa 9000 B.C. (Crawford and Shen 1998:862). Crawford and Shen point out that calibrated radiocarbon dates show that direct evidence of the earliest cultivated rice is no older than 7000 B.C. (Crawford and Shen 1998:862). [[Jared Diamond]], a biologist and popular science author, summarizes some of the work done by professional archaeologists mentioned above and estimates that the earliest attested domestication of rice took place in China by 7500 B.C.<ref>{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | year = 1999 | title = Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher = W.W. Norton & Company | location = New York | id = ISBN 0-393-31755-2}}</ref>  

Most of the Neolithic sites in China with finds of charred rice and radiocarbon dates are from 5000 B.C. or later (Crawford and Shen 1998). This evidence leads most archaeologists to say that large-scale dry-land rice farming began between 5000 and 4500 BC in the area of [[Yangtze Delta]] (for example [[Hemudu culture]], discovered in 1970s), and the wet-rice cultivation began at approximately 2500 BC in the same area ([[Liangzhu culture]]). It is now commonly thought that some areas such as the alluvial plains in [[Shaoxing]] and [[Ningbo]] in [[Zhejiang]] province are the cradle-lands of East Asian rice cultivation. Finally, ancient textual evidence of the cultivation of rice in China dates to 3000 years ago.

'''Korea and Japan'''

In 2003 archaeologists alleged that they discovered burnt grains (domesticated rice) in Soro-ri, Korea, that predate the oldest grains in China. This find potentially challenges the mainstream explanation that domesticated rice originated in China.<ref>Cf. BBC news (2003) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3207552.stm]</ref> Unfortunately, the media reports of the Soro-ri charred grains are brief and lack sufficient detail for archaeologists and other scientists to properly evaluate the true meaning of this very unusual find.   

Reliable, mainstream archaeological evidence derived from palaeoethnobotanical investigations indicate that dry-land rice was introduced to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] some time between [[3500 BC|3500]] and [[1200 BC]]. The cultivation of rice in Korea and Japan during that time occurred on a small-scale, fields were impermanent plots, and evidence shows that in some cases domesticated and wild grains were planted together. The technological, subsistence, and social impact of rice and grain cultivation is not evident in archaeological data until after [[1500 BC]]. For example, intensive wet-[[paddy field|paddy]] rice agriculture was introduced into Korea shortly before or during the Middle [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (c. 850-550 BC) and reached Japan by the Final Jomon or Initial [[Yayoi]] circa [[300 BC]] (Crawford and Lee 2003; Crawford and Shen 1998).

===India===

It is generally assumed that the [[Rigveda]]'s have no mention of rice. There is however mention of ApUpa, Puro-das and Odana (rice-gruel) in the Rig Veda, terms that, at least in later texts, refer to rice dishes,<ref>Cf. Talageri (2000) [[Shrikant G. Talageri|Talageri, Shrikant]]: [[The Rigveda: A Historical Analysis]], 2000. ISBN 81-7742-010-0</ref> The rigvedic commentator [[Sayana]] refers to "tandula" when commenting on RV 1.16.2., which usually means rice. <ref>Rice Research in South Asia through Ages by Y L Nene, Asian Agri-History Vol. 9, No. 2, 2005 (85<U+2013>106). With reference to Sontakke and Kashikar, 1983</ref> It was also speculated that the rigvedic term dhana (dhanaa, dhanya) could possibly refer to rice.<ref>Rice Research in South Asia through Ages by Y L Nene, Asian Agri-History Vol. 9, No. 2, 2005 (85<U+2013>106).</ref> Both [[Charaka]] and [[Sushruta]] mention rice in some detail.<ref>Rice Research in South Asia through Ages by Y L Nene, Asian Agri-History Vol. 9, No. 2, 2005 (85<U+2013>106).</ref> The [[Arthasastra]] discusses some aspects of rice cultivation.<ref>Rice Research in South Asia through Ages by Y L Nene, Asian Agri-History Vol. 9, No. 2, 2005 (85<U+2013>106).</ref> The [[Kashyapiyakrishisukti]] by [[Kashyapa]] is the most detailed ancient Sanskrit text on rice cultivation.<ref>Rice Research in South Asia through Ages by Y L Nene, Asian Agri-History Vol. 9, No. 2, 2005 (85<U+2013>106).</ref>

===Africa===

African rice has been cultivated for 3500 years. Between [[1500 BC|1500]] and [[800 BC]], ''O. glaberrima'' propagated from its original centre, the [[Niger River]] [[river delta|delta]], and extended to [[Senegal]]. However, it never developed far from its original region. Its cultivation even declined in favour of the Asian species, possibly brought to the African [[continent]] by Arabs coming from the east coast between the [[7th century|7th]] and [[11th century|11th]] centuries CE.

[[Image:GoEnDamaScan.jpg|thumb|The rice motif on this five-yen coin underscores the importance of the grain to the people of Japan]]

===Near East and Europe===

''O. sativa'' was adapted to farming in the [[Middle East]] and [[Mediterranean]] [[Europe]] around [[800 BC]].  The [[Moors]] brought it to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] when they conquered it in [[711]] [[AD]]. After the middle of the [[15th century]], rice spread throughout [[Italy]] and then [[France]], later propagating to all the continents during the great age of European exploration. 

===The Americas===

In [[1694]], rice arrived in [[South Carolina]], probably originating from [[Madagascar]]. The Spanish brought rice to [[South America]] at the beginning of the [[18th century]].

In the [[United States]], [[colonial]] South Carolina and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] grew and amassed great [[wealth]] from the [[Slavery|slave]] labour obtained from the [[Senegambia (geography)|Senegambia]] area of [[West Africa]]. At the [[port]] of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of [[Africa]] brought the highest prices, in recognition of their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice [[plantation]]s around [[Georgetown, South Carolina|Georgetown]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. From the slaves, plantation owners learned how to dyke the [[marsh|marshes]] and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was milled by hand with [[wood]]en paddles, then winnowed in [[sweetgrass]] [[basket]]s (the making of which was another skill brought by the slaves). The invention of the rice [[mill (factory)|mill]] increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in [[1787]] by [[millwright]] [[Jonathan Lucas]] was another step forward. Rice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less [[profit]]able with the loss of slave labour after the [[American Civil War]], and it finally died out just after the turn of the [[20th century]]. The predominant strain of rice in the Carolinas was from Africa and was known as "Carolina Gold." The [[cultivar]] has been preserved and there are current attempts to reintroduce it as a commercially grown crop. <ref>http://www.carolinagoldricefoundation.org/ Carolina Gold Rice Foundation</ref>

World production of rice <ref>all figures from UNCTAD 1998-2002 and the [http://www.irri.org/science/ricestat/index.asp International Rice Research Institute] statistics (accessed September 2005)</ref> has risen steadily from about 200 million tons of paddy rice in 1960 to 600 million tons in 2004. Milled rice is about 68% of paddy rice by weight. In the year 2004, the top three producers were China (31% of world production), India (20%), and Indonesia (9%).

World trade figures are very different, as only about 5-6% of rice produced is traded internationally. The largest three exporting countries are [[Thailand]] (26% of world exports), [[Vietnam]] (15%), and the [[United States]] (11%), while the largest three importers are Indonesia (14%), Bangladesh (4%), and Brazil (3%).

Rice is the most important crop in Asia. In Cambodia, for example, 90% of the total agricultural area is used for rice production (see "The Burning of the Rice" by Don Puckridge for the story of rice production in Cambodia [http://sidharta.com/books/index.jsp?uid=67]).

==Rice pests==
{{Main|List of rice diseases}}
Rice pests are any [[organisms]] or [[microbes]] with the potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop (or of rice seeds) <ref>Jahn et al. 2000</ref> (Jahn et al 2007). Rice pests include [[weed]]s, [[pathogen]]s, [[insect]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[bird]]s. A variety of factors can contribute to pest outbreaks, including the overuse of [[pesticides]] and high rates of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] application (e.g. Jahn et al. 2005)[http://docserver.esa.catchword.org/deliver/cw/pdf/esa/freepdfs/0046225x/v34n4s26.pdf]. Weather conditions also contribute to pest outbreaks. For example, rice gall midge and army worm outbreaks tend to follow high rainfall early in the wet season, while [[thrip]]s outbreaks are associated with drought (Douangboupha et al. 2006).

One of the challenges facing crop protection specialists is to develop rice pest management techniques which are sustainable. In other words, to manage crop pests in such a manner that future crop production is not threatened (Jahn et al. 2001).  Rice pests are managed by cultural techniques, pest-resistant rice varieties, and [[pesticide]]s (which include [[insecticide]]). Increasingly, there is evidence that farmers' pesticide applications are often unnecessary [http://www.petrra-irri.org/html/sp_doc_download.asp?doc_id=105 (Jahn et al. 2004a)] [http://www.scidev.net/Features/index.cfm?fuseaction=readfeatures&itemid=306&language=1][http://www.irri.org/videos/LITE-research.wmv][http://www.irri.org/videos/LITE-research.rm].  By reducing the populations of natural enemies of rice pests (Jahn 1992), misuse of insecticides can actually lead to pest outbreaks (Cohen et al. 1994).  Among rice cultivars there are differences in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage ([http://titania.esa.catchword.org/vl=10988418/cl=24/nw=1/rpsv/cw/esa/00220493/v97n6/s20/p1923 Jahn et al. 2004b], Khiev et al. 2000).  Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems.  Major rice pests include the brown planthopper (Preap et al. 2006), the rice gall midge (Jahn and Khiev 2004), the rice bug [http://titania.esa.catchword.org/vl=10988418/cl=24/nw=1/rpsv/cw/esa/00220493/v97n6/s20/p1923 (Jahn et al. 2004b)], rats (Leung et al 2002), and the anthropogenic weed ''Echinochloa crusgali'' (Pheng et al. 2001).

==Cultivars==
The largest collection of rice cultivars is at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([http://www.irri.org/ IRRI]), with over 100,000 rice accessions [http://www.irri.org/media/press/press.asp?id=1] held in the International Rice Genebank [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=9291960&dopt=Abstract].  Rice [[cultivar]]s are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. For example, Thai [[Jasmine rice]] is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as long-grain rice contains less [[amylopectin]] than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants usually serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice. Japanese [[mochigome|mochi rice]] and Chinese [[sticky rice]] are short-grain.  Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as "glutinous rice" (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to "gluten") to make [[zongzi]]. The [[Japanese rice|Japanese table rice]] is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese [[sake]] rice is another kind as well.

Indian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic [[Basmati]] (grown in the North), long and medium-grained [[Patna rice]] and short-grained Masoori. In South India the most prized cultivar is 'ponni' which is primarily grown in the delta regions of [[Kaveri]] River. [[Kaveri]] is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown.  Rice in [[East India]] and [[South India]], is usually prepared by boiling the rice in large pans immediately after harvesting and before removing the husk; this is referred to in English as ''[[parboiled rice]]''. It is then dried, and the husk removed later. It often displays small red speckles, and has a smoky flavour from the fires. Usually coarser rice is used for this procedure. It helps to retain the natural vitamins and kill any [[fungus|fungi]] or other contaminants, but leads to an odour which some find peculiar. This rice is easier on the stomach to digest. In [[South India]], it is also used to make [[idli]]s.
[[Image:Brown rice.jpg|thumb|Brown Rice]]
[[Image:sona-masuri.jpg|right|thumb|Polished [[sona masuri]] rice.]]
Aromatic rices have definite aromas and flavours; the most noted cultivars are [[Thai fragrant rice]], Basmati, Patna rice, and a [[hybrid]] cultivar from America sold under the trade name, [[Texmati]]. It is a cross between Basmati and American long-grained rice that is creating great controversy.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild [[popcorn]]-like aroma and flavour. In Indonesia there are also ''red'' and ''black'' cultivars.

High-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in [[Africa]] and other dry [[ecosystem]]s called the [[New Rice for Africa|new rice for Africa]] (NERICA) cultivars have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve [[food security]] in [[West Africa]].

Scientists are working on so-called ''[[golden rice]]'' which is genetically modified to produce beta [[carotene]], the precursor to [[vitamin A]].

Draft [[genome]]s for the two most common rice cultivars, ''indica'' and ''japonica'', were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a [[model organism]] for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega[[base pair]]s).
