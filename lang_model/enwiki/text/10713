'''Jane Grey Cannon Swisshelm''' (December 6, 1815 &ndash; July 22, 1884) was an [[United States|American]] [[journalist]], [[abolitionist]], and [[women's rights]] advocate.

Swisshelm was born Jane Grey Cannon in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[USA]], daughter of Thomas Cannon, a Presbyterian merchant and real estate speculator.  A teacher at age 14, she married at age 21; she moved with her husband, James Swisshelm, to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where she first encountered slavery.  It made a strong impression on her. Jane was strong-willed, and her marriage was difficult.  In 1839, she moved to [[Philadelphia]], against her husband's wishes, to care for her ailing mother.  After her mother's death, she headed a [[seminary]] in [[Butler, Pennsylvania]].  She rejoined her husband two years later on his farm, which she called Swissvale, east of Pittsburgh.  (Today the area is [[Swissvale, Pennsylvania]]).

During this time, she began writing articles against [[capital punishment]] and stories, poems, and articles for an anti-slavery newspaper and others in Pittsburgh.  When that paper went out of business, Swisshem founded her own called ''Saturday Vistior''. It eventually reached a national circulation of 6,000.  She wrote many [[editorial]]s advocating women's [[property rights]].

In 1857, she divorced her husband and moved west to [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]], where she controlled a string of papers, promoting abolition and women's rights by writing and lecturing.  Writing in ''The Saint Cloud Visiter'', Swisshelm waged a private war against [[General]] [[Sylvanus Lowry]], an aristocratic Southerner who had settled in the area and reigned as Saint Cloud's [[political boss]].  Swisshelm was especially infuriated that Lowry owned slaves in the free territory of Minnesota.  Writing in ''The Visiter'', she accused General Lowry of swindling the Indians, ordering [[vigilante]] attacks on suspected [[claim jumpers]], and torturing his own slaves.  After a particularly fiery editorial, Lowry formed a "Committee of Vigilance," broke into the newspaper's offices, smashed the [[printing press]], and threw the pieces into the nearby [[Mississippi River]].  She soon raised money for another press and raised her attacks to a fever pitch.  General Lowry, who was being groomed for the post of [[Lieutenant Governor]], was forced to watch the destruction of all his influence over Saint Cloud politics.  He died in obscurity in 1865. 

In 1862, when a [[Sioux]] [[Dakota War of 1862|Indian uprising]] in [[Minnesota]] resulted in the deaths of hundreds of white settlers,<ref>Duane Schultz, ''Over The Earth I Come: The Great Sioux Uprising of 1862'', St. Martin's Press, New York, 1993. See page 5: "Estimates of the death toll range from four hundred to two thousand."</ref> it prompted her to demand punishment by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] against the Indians.  She toured major cities to this end and, while in [[Washington, D.C.]], met her Pittsburgh friend [[Edwin M. Stanton]], then [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], who offered her a clerkship in the government.  She sold her Minnesota paper but worked as an army nurse during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in the Washington area, until her job became available.  She became a friend of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]].

After the war, Swisshelm started her final newspaper, the ''Reconstructionist'', but her blasts against President [[Andrew Johnson]] led to her losing the paper and her government job.  In 1872, she attended the [[Prohibition Party]] convention as a delegate.

Swisshelm died in 1884 at her Swissvale home and is buried in [[Allegheny Cemetery]].  The city of Pittsburgh neighborhood of [[Swisshelm Park]], adjacent to Swissvale, is named in her honor.
