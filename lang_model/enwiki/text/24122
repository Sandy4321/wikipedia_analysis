Striking the [[Autonomous Region of Azores]] on January 1, the '''1980 Azores Island earthquake''' killed 61 people and injured over 400, causing severe damage on the islands of [[Terceira Island|Terceira]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Jorge Island|S<U+00E3>o Jorge]]. Measuring 7.2 on the [[Richter scale]], it also shook the islands of [[Pico Island|Pico]] and [[Faial Island|Faial]]. The earthquake was found to be, like other Azores earthquakes, ruptured in a [[strike slip fault|strike slip]] motion.    

In response to the earthquake, Portuguese president [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Ramalho Eanes]] announced three days of national mourning. Relief efforts, initiated by local Air Force agents, were successful and were soon accompanied by government-supported agencies.

== Geology ==
=== Background ===
In 1950, another strong earthquake had rocked the Azores Islands region, and this was the largest earthquake since.<ref name=Kingman/>

=== Description ===
The Azores islands are [[Volcanism|volcanic]] in origin and lie in a [[Tectonics|tectonically]] complex area to the east of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. They lie close to the boundary between the [[Eurasian plate|Eurasian]] and [[African plate]] but are generally considered to form their own [[microplate]].<ref name="Borges">Borges, J.F., Bezzeghoud, M., Buforn, E., Pro, C. & Fitas, A. 2007.

After [[aftershock]]s from the quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a [[focal mechanism|focal solution]] to the small events. Movement of these shocks were similar to previous earthquakes around the Azores Islands. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate [[nodal]] plane was responsible, seeing [[Shear (geology)|fault shear]] on the right-lateral ([[dextral]]) side.<ref name=AGU/> All faulting in this area is [[strike slip fault|strike-slip]]-oriented, and on a rather large scale.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Regional stresses along the Eurasia-Africa plate boundary derived from focal mechanisms of large earthquakes|publisher=Birkh<U+00E4>user Basel|journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics|volume=136|issue=4|pages=433<U+2013>448|doi=10.1007/BF00878580|year=1990|author=Ud<U+00ED>as, Agust<U+00ED>n|coauthors=Buforn, Elisa|accessdate=October 4, 2009}}</ref> Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.<ref name=AGU>{{cite journal|title=Aftershock sequence of the January 1, 1980, earthquake and present-day tectonics in the Azores|publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|author=Hirn, A.|coauthors=Haessler, H.; Trong, P.

== Relief efforts and response ==
United States Navy and Air Force troops stationed at Lajes functioned as disaster relief workers,<ref name=Kingman/> sheltering as many as 150 families.<ref name=Lajes>{{cite web|url=http://www.lajes.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4004|title=Lajes Field History - Humanitarian Efforts, 1980s and 1990s|publisher=Lajes Air Field|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref> Portuguese Air Force members brought supplies to earthquake victims, while a [[Jo<U+00E3>o Coutinho class corvette]] navy ship transported medical officials to the island. The President [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Ramalho Eanes]] flew in on a plane accompanied by medical personnel and supplies such as bedding.<ref name=Kingman/> Local officials including policemen and volunteer firemen cleared roads for relief supplies transportation. Responding to the situation, they were to look through rubble spawned from the earthquake for survivors.<ref name=Kingman/> Soon after, huts were built to replace the destroyed homes for 200 families of the islands. 100 huts were constructed by a [[People to People International|People to People]] project fund.<ref name=Lajes/>

Three [[day of national mourning|days of national mourning]] were declared by Eanes.<ref name=Kingman/> Nineteen [[seismograph]] stations have since been installed and are relied on by most of the islands' people. Eleven of them are used to monitor activity, while the other eight also record information on a [[geothermal]] area.{{sfn|Lee|Hung|2003|p=1415}}

The earthquake forced hundreds of people to leave the country for the United States. It occurred during a period of several major natural disasters in which many residents of the island left; in 1975, 8,000 residents left. In 1981, however, just 2,500 people left the island.<ref name=MIG/>

== Analysis and current situation ==
Later studies of the events leading up to the tragedy found several factors contributing to the extent of the damage. A. Malheiro (2006) linked five major causes to damage from these earthquakes. The buildings most damaged by the earthquake were near fault lines on top of loosely packed soil. They tended to be of poor construction and did not conform to proper building code or had not been adequately addressed.<ref name=AMAL>{{cite journal|title=Geological hazards in the Azores archipelago: Volcanic terrain instability and human vulnerability|date=August 2006|volume=156|issue=1-2|journal=Journal of Volcanology & Geothermal Research|author=Malheiro, A.|accessdate=December 29, 2010}}</ref>

The area around the Azores remains active. Threats from earthquakes and [[landslide]]s remain.<ref name=AMAL/>
