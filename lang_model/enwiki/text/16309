'''Temple Sinai''' is a [[Reform Jewish]] Synagogue located in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. It primarily serves Jewish residents on the west side of the city as well as a number of western suburbs, including [[Katy, Texas|Katy]], [[Cinco Ranch, Texas|Cinco Ranch]] and [[Sugar Land, Texas|Sugar Land]]. The congregation is composed of more than 200 families and is led by Rabbi Annie Belford. The synagogue is a member of the [[Union for Reform Judaism]] (URJ) and its youth group is associated with the [[North American Federation of Temple Youth]] (NFTY).

==History==
The congregation was founded in 1979 by nine families seeking to establish a Reform Jewish presence in western Harris County. Its first Rabbi, Abraham Shaw served in a part-time capacity until 1984, when he was succeeded by Rabbi Howard Rabinowitz. The congregation experienced significant growth in the 1990s, resulting in the hiring of its first full-time rabbi, Todd Thalblum, in 1999, and the construction of a new building. Rabbi Thalblum served until 2008 and was succeeded by Rabbi Barry Diamond on an interim basis until a new rabbi was selected. In 2009, Temple Sinai hired Rabbi Annie Belford who is one of the first women to serve as a solo rabbi for a Houston congregation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.temple-sinai.org/about/rabbi/ |title=Rabbi Annie Belford |publisher=Temple-sinai.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref>
