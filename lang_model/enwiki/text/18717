'''Ames Laboratory''' is a [[United States Department of Energy]] [[national laboratory]] located in [[Ames, Iowa]].  The Laboratory conducts research into various areas of national concern, including the synthesis and study of new materials, energy resources, high-speed computer design, and environmental cleanup and restoration. It is located on the campus of [[Iowa State University]]. It is operated for the [[United States Department of Energy]] under contract DE-AC02-07CH11358.  

==History==
===1940s===
Ames Laboratory was formally established in 1947 by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] as a result of the Ames Project's successful development of the most efficient process, the [[Ames process | Ames Process]], to produce high-purity uranium metal in large quantities for the [[Manhattan Project]]. In 1942, Iowa State College's [[Frank Spedding]], an expert in the chemistry of rare earths, agreed to set up and direct a chemical research and development program to accompany the Manhattan Project's existing physics program. Its purpose was to produce high purity [[uranium]] from uranium [[ore]]s. Harley Wilhelm developed new methods for both reducing and casting uranium metal, making it possible to cast large ingots of the metal and reduce production costs by as much as twentyfold.  About one third (2 tons) of the uranium used in the first self sustaining [[nuclear reaction]] at the [[University of Chicago]] was provided by this project. The Ames Project produced more than 2 million pounds (1,000 tons) of uranium for the Manhattan Project until industry took over the process in 1945.

The Ames project received the [[Army-Navy <U+2018>E<U+2019> Award]] for Excellence in Production on October 12, 1945, signifying two-and-a-half years of excellence in industrial production of metallic uranium as a vital war material. [[Iowa State University]] is unique among educational institutions to have received this award for outstanding service, an honor normally given to industry.  Other key accomplishments related to the project:

<U+2022>  Developed a process to recover [[uranium]] from scrap materials and convert it into good ingots.<br />
<U+2022>  Developed an [[ion exchange]] process to separate [[rare earth element]]s from each other in gram quantities <U+2014> something not possible with other methods. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a large-scale production process for [[thorium]] using a bomb-reduction method. 

===1950s===
During the 1950s the Lab<U+2019>s growing reputation for its work with [[Rare earth element|rare earth]] metals rapidly increased its workload. As the country explored the uses of nuclear power, lab scientists studied [[nuclear fuels]] and structural materials for [[nuclear reactor]]s. Processes developed at Ames Laboratory resulted in the production of the purest rare-earth metals in the world while at the same time reducing the price of the metals as much as 1,000 percent. In most cases, Lab facilities served as models for large-scale production of rare earth metals. Lab scientists took advantage of [[Iowa State University]]'s [[synchrotron]] to pursue medium-energy physics research. Analytical chemistry efforts expanded to keep up with the need to analyze new materials. 

'''Other key accomplishments from the 1950s:''' <br />
<U+2022>  Developed processes for separating [[hafnium]], [[niobium]], [[barium]], [[strontium]], [[caesium]] and [[rubidium]].<br /> 
<U+2022>  Discovered a new [[isotope]], [[phosphorus]]-33. <br />
<U+2022>  Separated high-purity rare earth oxides in kilogram quantities. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a method of separating [[plutonium]] and [[nuclear fission|fission]] products from spent [[uranium]] fuel. <br />
<U+2022>  Produced high-purity [[yttrium]] metal in large quantities, shipping more than 18,000 pounds before industry took over the process. 

=== 1960s ===
During the 1960s the Lab reached peak employment as its scientists continued exploring new materials.  As part of that effort, the Lab built a 5-megawatt [[heavy water reactor]] for [[neutron diffraction]] studies and additional [[isotope]] separation research.  The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] established the Rare-Earth Information Center at Ames Lab to provide the scientific and technical communities with information about rare-earth metals and their compounds. 

'''Other key accomplishments from the 1960s''': <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a process to produce [[thorium]] metal with a purity of 99.985 percent. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a process for producing high-purity [[vanadium]] metal for [[nuclear power|nuclear]] applications. <br />
<U+2022>  Discovered a new [[isotope]], [[copper]]-69. <br />
<U+2022>  Conducted the first successful operation of an isotope separator connected to a reactor in order to study short-lived radioactivity produced by fission of [[uranium]]-235.<br /> 
<U+2022>  Ames Lab Physicists succeed in growing the first large crystal of solid helium

===1970s===
During the 1970s, as the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] evolved into the [[United States Department of Energy]], efforts diversified as some research programs closed and new ones opened. Federal officials consolidated reactor facilities, leading to the closure of the research reactor. Ames Laboratory responded by putting new emphasis on [[applied mathematics]], [[solar power]], [[fossil fuels]] and pollution control. Innovative analytical techniques were developed to provide precise information from increasingly small samples. Foremost among them was [[inductively coupled plasma]]-atomic emission [[spectroscopy]], which could rapidly and simultaneously detect up to 40 different trace metals from a small sample. 

'''Other key accomplishments from the 1970s:''' <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a highly sensitive technique for the direct analysis of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in air, water, fish and soils. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a method for isolating minute amounts of organic compounds found in water. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a process for removing copper, tin and chromium from automotive scrap, yielding reclaimed steel pure enough for direct re-use. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed an [[image intensifier]] screen that significantly reduced exposure to medical [[X-ray]]s. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a [[solar heating]] module that could both store and transmit [[solar power]].

===1980s===
In the 1980s research at Ames Laboratory evolved to meet local and national energy needs. [[Fossil energy]] research focused on ways to burn [[coal]] cleaner.  New technologies were developed to clean up [[nuclear waste]] sites. High-performance computing research augmented the [[applied mathematics]] and [[solid-state physics]] programs. Ames Laboratory  became a national leader in the fields of [[superconductivity]] and [[nondestructive evaluation]]. In addition, DOE established the [http://www.mpc.ameslab.gov Materials Preparation Center]  to provide public access to the development of new materials. 

'''Other key accomplishments from the 1980s:''' <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a liquid-junction [[solar cell]] that was efficient, durable and non-toxic. <br />
<U+2022>  Received Defense Department funding to develop [[nondestructive evaluation]] techniques for [[aircraft]]. <br />
<U+2022>  Became DOE<U+2019>s lead laboratory for managing the environmental assessment of energy-recovery processes. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a new method for [[alloying]] pure [[neodymium]] with [[iron]], producing the feedstock for a widely used [[neodymium magnet]].<br />
<U+2022>  Assisted in development of [[Terfenol]] which changes form in a magnetic field, making it ideal for [[sonar]] and [[transducer]] applications. 

===1990s===
Encouraged by [[United States Department of Energy]], in the 1990s Ames Laboratory continued its efforts to transfer basic research findings to industry for the development of new materials, products and processes.  The [http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ Scalable Computing Laboratory] was established to find ways of making [[parallel computing]] accessible and cost-effective for the scientific community.  Researchers discovered the first non-carbon example of [[buckyballs]], <U+2013> a new material important in the field of [[microelectronics]]. Scientists developed a [[DNA]] sequencer that was 24 times faster than other devices, and a technique that assessed the nature of DNA damage by chemical pollutants. 

'''Other key accomplishment of the 1990s:''' <br />
<U+2022>  Developed [[HINT]] benchmarking technique that objectively compared computers of all sizes, now supported at [[BYU]]'s [http://hint.byu.edu/ HINT] site. <br />
<U+2022>  Improved method of high pressure gas atomization for turning molten metal into fine- grained metal powders. <br />
<U+2022>  Predicted the geometry for a ceramic structure with a photonic [[band gap]]. These structures may improved the efficiency of [[laser]]s, sensing devices and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s. <br />
<U+2022>  Discovered a new class of materials that could make [[magnetic refrigeration]] a viable cooling technology for the future. <br />
<U+2022>  Developed a high-strength lead-free [[solder]]. 

===Recent Developments===

The following are examples of how Ames Laboratory continues to contribute:

<U+2022>  Novel, [[platinum]]-modified [[nickel]]-[[aluminide]] coatings that deliver unprecedented [[oxidation]] and phase stability as bond coat layers in [[thermal barrier coating]]s, which could improve the durability of [[gas turbine]] engines, allowing them to operate at higher temperatures and extending their lifetimes.<br />
<U+2022>  Research confirming negative [[refraction]] can be observed in [[photonic crystals]] in the [[microwave]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which moves physicists one step closer to constructing materials that exhibit negative refraction at optical wavelengths and realizing the much-sought-after [[superlens]].<br />
<U+2022>  Discovery of [[intermetallic compounds]] that are [[ductile]] at room temperature. could be used to produce practical materials from coatings that are highly resistant to [[corrosion]] and strong at high temperatures to flexible [[superconducting]] wires and powerful [[magnets]]. <br />
<U+2022>  Development of heterogeneous [[catalysts]] whose ability to be recycled could help reduce costs for production of [[biodiesel]] fuel and eliminate waste-storage costs.<br />
<U+2022>  Research on the photophysics of [[luminescent]] organic thin films and [[organic light-emitting diode]]s resulted in a novel integrated oxygen sensor and a new sensor company.<br />

<U+2022>  Material for [[magnetic refrigeration]] that improves refrigerator [[Efficient energy use|efficiency]] by an estimated 40 percent in large-scale refrigeration units and air conditioners.<br />
<U+2022>  Developed a mechanochemical process that is a solvent-free way to produce organic compounds in solid state. Being used to study new, complex hydride materials that could provide a solution for high-capacity, safe hydrogen storage needed to make hydrogen-powered vehicles viable.<br />
<U+2022>  The design and demonstration of photonic [[band gap]] crystals, a geometrical arrangement of [[dielectric]] materials that allows light to pass except when the [[frequency]] falls within a forbidden range. These materials would make it easier to develop numerous practical devices, including optical lasers, [[optical computer]]s, and [[solar cell]]s.

As seen above, Ames Laboratory has broadened the scope of its research into various areas of national concern, including energy resources, high-speed computer design, environmental cleanup and restoration, and the synthesis and study of new materials.
