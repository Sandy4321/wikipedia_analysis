It originated in [[India]].<ref name="origin in India">{{zh icon}} {{cite web |url=http://shipin.people.com.cn/GB/8614623.html |title=<U+82CF><U+5DDE><U+5BD2><U+5C71><U+5BFA><U+5E7F><U+65BD>"<U+814A><U+516B><U+7CA5>" <U+6700><U+65E9><U+8D77><U+6E90><U+4E8E><U+5370><U+5EA6> (Suzhou's Hanshan Temple gives out Laba congee.

The day on which it is traditionally eaten is commonly known as the [[Laba Festival]]. The earliest form of this dish was cooked by red beans and has since developed into many different kinds. It is mainly made up of many kinds of rice, beans, dried fruit, tofu, potato, meat and vegetables.

==History==
In the [[Han Dynasty]], during the [[Laba Festival]], people do not consume Laba congee as it is used for worshipping the gods. In the [[Northern and Southern Dynasties]] period, the date of the Laba Festival was fixed on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month. In the [[Song Dynasty]], Laba congee is widely consumed throughout China by not only the common people, but also government officials and aristocrats. In the [[Qing Dynasty]], the Laba Festival is sometimes celebrated as the "[[Spring Festival]]", and Laba congee became even more popular. In the imperial court, the emperor and nobles will give Laba congee to the officials, servants, and others.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.gov.cn/fwxx/wy/2008-01/15/content_858085.htm <U+814A><U+516B><U+8282><U+5728><U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+5DF2><U+6709><U+5343><U+5E74><U+5386><U+53F2> <U+6C11><U+95F4><U+6709><U+559D><U+814A><U+516B><U+7CA5><U+4E60><U+4FD7> (The history of the Laba Festival in China dates back to thousands of years ago.

==Legends==
There are several legends in China about the significance of Laba congee.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.cnetnews.com.cn/2008/0115/709298.shtml <U+814A><U+516B><U+8282><U+7684><U+8D77><U+6E90><U+4E0E><U+4F20><U+8BF4> (The origins and legends of the Laba Festival)]</ref> Some of these legends are:

* The consumption of Laba congee is to commemorate the [[Song Dynasty]] general [[Yue Fei]], who is widely regarded as a patriot and national hero in Chinese culture.{{cn|date=November 2012}}
* Zhu Yuanzhang (the [[Hongwu Emperor]]), the founder of the [[Ming Dynasty]], used to live in poverty before he rose to power. He ate congee during those hard times. After becoming the emperor, he asked the people to eat congee as well.<ref name="origin of Laba porridge">{{zh icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.cnetnews.com.cn/2008/0115/709183.shtml|title= <U+814A><U+516B><U+8282><U+7684><U+7531><U+6765><U+548C><U+51E0><U+4E2A><U+4F20><U+8BF4> (The origin of the Laba Festival and some legends related to it)}}</ref>
* Siddh<U+0101>rtha Gautama (the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]) once attempted to find the right path to awakening by starving himself. One day, when he was starved and weakened, he met a village girl who gave him milk and rice pudding (congee) after mistaking him for a spirit who granted her a wish. He attained enlightenment not long after that incident.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.chinahexie.org.cn/a/zhonghuaguibao/minsuwenhua/nianjiefengsu/2011/0111/6158.html <U+814A><U+516B><U+7CA5><U+7684><U+6545><U+4E8B> (The story of Laba congee)]</ref> (See [[Gautama Buddha#Awakening]] for the story.)
