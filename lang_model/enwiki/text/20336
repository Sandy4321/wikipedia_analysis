'''''Minas Geraes''''', spelled '''''Minas Gerais''''' in modern sources,<ref group=A>''Geraes'' was the spelling when the ship was commissioned, but later changes to Portuguese [[orthography]] deprecated it in favor of ''Gerais''.</ref> was a [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]] built for the [[Brazilian Navy]]. Named in honor of the [[states of Brazil|Brazilian state]] of [[Minas Gerais]], the ship was completed in 1908 as the [[lead ship]] of [[Minas Geraes class battleship|her class]]. Although frequently in poor condition, the major warships constructed under Brazil's 1904 building program&mdash;''Minas Geraes'', her [[sister ship|sister]] {{Ship|Brazilian battleship|S<U+00E3>o Paulo||2}}, the [[cruiser]]s ''Bahia'' and ''Rio Grande do Sul'', and most of a ten-member [[destroyer]] class&mdash;formed the core of the Brazilian Navy from their completion in 1908<U+2013>1910 until the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref>Gardiner and Gray (1980), pp. 403&ndash;406</ref>

Not long after her commissioning, ''Minas Geraes'' was featured in the 19&nbsp;March 1910 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]'', which described her as "the last word in heavy battleship design and the [...] most powerfully armed warship afloat".<ref name=SA>{{cite journal |year=1910 |month=March |day=19 |title=The Brazilian Battleship "Minas Geraes" |journal=Scientific American |volume=102 |pages=240&ndash;241 |publisher=Munn & Co., Inc. |location=New York |issn=0036-8733 |oclc=}}</ref> Seven months later, she was the focal point of the "[[Revolt of the Whip]]". The mutiny spread from ''Minas Geraes'' to other ships in the Navy, including the recently commissioned ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', the old coastal defense ship ''Deodoro'', and the new cruiser ''Bahia''. Led by the "Black Admiral" [[Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto]], the mutineers threatened to bombard the Brazilian capital of [[Rio de Janeiro]] if their demands were not met. As it was not possible to end the situation militarily&mdash;the only loyal troops nearby being small [[torpedo boat]]s and army troops confined to land&mdash;the [[National Congress of Brazil]] gave in and the rebels disbanded.

When Brazil entered the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1917, Britain's [[Royal Navy]] declined Brazil's offer of ''Minas Geraes'' for duty with the [[Grand Fleet]] because the ship was outdated; she had not been refitted since entering service, so [[rangefinder|range-finders]] and a [[fire-control system]] had not been added. ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' underwent modernization in the United States in 1920; in 1921, ''Minas Geraes'' received the same treatment. In 1924, mutineers seized ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' and attempted to persuade the crews of ''Minas Geraes'' and several other ships to join them. Unsuccessful, the mutineers fired one of ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''{{'}}s 6-pounder guns at ''Minas Geraes'', wounding one crew member; they then left the harbor, exchanging shots with harbor defenses along the way, and set course for [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, where they obtained [[Right of asylum|asylum]].

''Minas Geraes'' was modernized at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard in the 1930s, and underwent further refitting from 1939 to 1943. During the Second World War, she was anchored in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] as the main defense of the port, as she was too old to play an active part in the war. For the last nine years of her service life, ''Minas Geraes'' remained largely inactive, and was towed to Italy for [[ship breaking|scrapping]] in March 1954.

== Background ==
In the years following the [[Rep<U+00FA>blica Velha#Constitutionalist Revolution|Brazilian revolution of 1889]], the nation's navy fell into disrepair. By the turn of the twentieth century it was lagging behind those of rivals Chile and Argentina; the only relatively new Brazilian ships larger than {{convert|3000|t|ST|abbr=on|lk=on}} were and two cruisers and two [[Coastal defence ship|coastal defense battleships]] of the {{Sclass|Deodoro|battleship|4}}.<ref name=Sondhaus216>Sondhaus (2001), p. 216</ref><ref name=Conways403>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 403</ref><ref group=A>Two other coastal defense ships, ''Riachuelo'' and ''Aquidab<U+00E3>'', had been rebuilt in 1893<U+2013>1895 and 1897<U+2013>1898, respectively. See: Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 404.</ref> 

[[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (state)#Early Twentieth Century|Soaring demand]] for coffee and [[rubber boom|rubber]] brought the Brazilian economy an influx of revenue,<ref name=Sondhaus216/><ref name=Conways403/> some of which was used to finance a 1904 Naval rearmament program.<ref name=Conways>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 404</ref> Approved by the Brazilian Congress in 1905, the program authorized the construction of twenty-eight ships, including three battleships and three [[armored cruiser]]s.<ref name=Sondhaus216/> The battleships' design was derived from the Norwegian coastal defense ship {{ship|HNoMS|Norge||2}} and the British (formerly Chilean) {{HMS|Triumph|1903|2}}; the new vessels were intended to be {{convert|19|knots|km/h|adj=on}}, {{convert|12000|t|ST|sigfig=3|adj=on}} [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] ships, each armed with twelve {{convert|10|in|cm|adj=on}} guns mounted in six twin turrets and protected by [[belt armor]] of {{convert|9|in|cm}} and deck armor of {{convert|1.5|in|cm|abbr=on}}.<ref>Whitley (1999), pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref>

All three battleships were ordered from British shipbuilder [[Armstrong Whitworth]], which subcontracted parts of the work to [[Vickers]]. However, shortly after their [[keel]]s had been laid down, construction was halted, prompted by the launch of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906.<ref name=Whitley24>Whitley (1999), p. 24</ref> The [[dreadnought]] concept had rendered all previous battleship designs outmoded.<ref name=BrazilNavy>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval.com.br/historia/dreadnought/dreadnought-port1.htm|title=Os Dreadnoughts Da Marinha Do Brasil: Minas Geraes e S<U+00E3>o Paulo|accessdate=16 April 2009|author=Paulo de Oliveira Ribeiro|date=1997|publisher=Poder Naval Online|language=Portuguese}}</ref> The keels were torn down and the plans redrafted in favor of a mostly new design,<ref name=Whitley24/> although some components<U+2014>such as the 9-inch belt armor<U+2014>were reused to save costs.<ref name=Bennighoff/> With the new plans completed, another contract was drawn up and signed on 20&nbsp;February 1907. The new design was for a modern dreadnought with twelve [[EOC 12 inch /45 naval gun|{{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}}/45 caliber guns]]<U+2014>a heavier armament than any other battleship afloat<ref name="English warships">{{Cite news| date = 1 August 1908| title = Germany may buy English warships| work = The New York Times| page = C8| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E0CE4D9123EE233A2575AC0A96E9C946997D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref><U+2014>and a top speed of {{convert|21|knots|km/h}}.

The new ships came as a shock to Brazil's neighbors, especially to Argentina&mdash;according to ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1906&ndash;1921'', they "outclassed the entire Argentinian fleet".<ref>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 400</ref> Their completion sparked a minor naval arms race in South America; Chile ordered {{Ship|Chilean battleship|Almirante Latorre||2}} and [[HMS Eagle (1918)|''Almirante Cochrane'']] from Britain, and Argentina ordered {{Ship|ARA|Rivadavia||2}} and {{Ship|ARA|Moreno||2}} from the United States.<ref name=Miller84>Miller (2001), p. 84</ref> The start of work on ''Minas Geraes'' meant that Brazil had become the third country<U+2014>behind the United Kingdom and the United States but ahead of major powers such as Germany, France and Russia<U+2014>to have a dreadnought under construction.<ref name=Sondhaus216/><ref name=Conways403 /><ref>Whitley (1999), p. 13</ref><ref group=A>Although Germany laid down {{SMS|Nassau||2}} two months after ''Minas Geraes'', ''Nassau'' was commissioned first.

[[File:Minas Geraes launch.jpg|thumb|''Minas Geraes'' soon after her [[Ship naming and launching|launch]] in September 1908]]
British and German professional journals speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a larger naval power, and was planning to hand over the ships once completed.<ref name=Conways/><ref name=Miller84 /> These suspicions were echoed by ''[[The New York Times]]'', which reported on 1&nbsp;August 1908:

{{quote|The rumor is that the three warships [...] which were ordered [in Britain] two years ago will be launched from English shores only to fly the German flag. It is asserted that these ships, which are named the Sao Paulo, the Minas Geras {{sic}} and the Rio de Janeiro, and all of which will be completed by next fall, will be conveyed to the German government on the payment of $30,000,000.}}
{{quote|It may be recalled that when orders were placed for the ships [...], there was much speculation as to the destiny of the vessels, as no naval expert could understand how a second-rate power like Brazil needed such formidable engines of war which would represent absolutely the latest stages of naval construction and armament. Meanwhile, it had been reported that the ships were being built for the Japanese government, which had a secret understanding with Brazil. But this theory was soon discarded by the fact that relations between these two countries were not extremely cordial on account of the attitude of Brazil toward the immigration of Japanese laborers. Then it was semi-officially stated that would never leave the ways except to fly the British flag, but the money for such a purpose could only be raised by a loan or the Admiralty getting the sum from the sinking fund.<ref name="English warships"/>}}

''Minas Geraes'' was [[Ship naming and launching|christened]] by Senhora Regis de Oliveira, the wife of the Brazilian minister to Great Britain,<ref name=launch>{{Cite news| date = 11 September 1908| title = Launch Greatest Warships| work = The New York Times| page = 5| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D06E6DB133EE233A25752C1A96F9C946997D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref> and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] at [[Newcastle-on-Tyne]] on 10 September 1908.<ref name="The Times"/> After the ship completed [[fitting-out]], she was handed over by Armstrong's to the Brazilian Commission on behalf of the Brazilian government, while the ship's company was mustered on deck.<ref name="Times 6 Jan"/> The British [[Royal Navy]] carried out her gunnery trials at the request of Armstrong's and with the agreement of the Brazilian government.<ref>Tupper (1929), p. 185</ref> Although the idea of having [[Superfire|superfiring]] turrets was not new<U+2014>the American {{Sclass|South Carolina|battleship|6}}s of 1908 had fore and aft turrets mounted in that fashion<U+2014>the trials attracted interest from a few nations, who sent representatives to observe. They wanted to resolve two major questions: the effect that firing the upper superfiring turrets would have on the crewmen in the lower guns, and whether smoke from the discharge of the lower guns would hinder the targeting capabilities of the upper turret. The tests resolved both questions satisfactorily.<ref name=SA/>

On ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} 1910 [[maiden voyage]], she steamed from Britain to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she met the American armored cruiser {{USS|North Carolina|ACR-12|2}}. The latter carried the body of [[Joaquim Nabuco]], the Brazilian ambassador to the United States (who had died in [[Washington, D.C.]] on 17&nbsp;January), and was escorted by ''Minas Geraes'' to Rio de Janeiro.<ref group=A>Contrary to contemporary ''New York Times'' articles, Whitley (1999) pp. 27<U+2013>28 states that ''Minas Geraes'' carried the body and ''North Carolina'' was the escort.</ref> Thick fog initially prevented ''North Carolina'' from picking up the body,<ref>{{Cite news| date = 3 March 1910| title = Minas Geraes Fogbound| work = The New York Times| page = 13| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D03EFDA1E30E333A25750C0A9659C946196D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| date = 6 March 1910| title = Society of Fort Monroe| work = The New York Times| page = X12| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C0CE0DC1430E233A25755C0A9659C946196D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref> but the two ships got underway on 17&nbsp;March 1910 and reached Rio de Janeiro one month later.<ref>Whitley (1999), pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref>

Soon after ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} arrival in Brazil, the country's prosperity began to wane, and a severe depression hit the Brazilian economy.<ref name=Conways/> The economic hardship, the racism prevalent in all branches of the Brazilian armed forces,<ref name=Smallman28>Smallman (2002), p. 28</ref> and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships spawned a mutiny known as the "[[Revolt of the Whip]]" among sailors on the most powerful ships.<ref name=Smallman28/><ref name=Scheina74>Scheina (2003), p. 74</ref>

[[File:Joao Candido.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto]] with reporters, officers and sailors on aboard ''Minas Geraes'' on 26 November 1910, the final day of the "[[Revolt of the Whip]]"]]

Many of the black sailors on ''Minas Geraes'' were slaves freed under the [[Lei <U+00C1>urea]] or their sons. Forced to enter the navy, they were widely discriminated against. It was common for officers to target black crewmen with "racial abuse and physical violence"; the sailors could not escape this abuse because they were required to serve for 15 years. Officers were quick to administer punishment with "leather whips tipped with metal balls" for even minor infractions.<ref name=Smallman28/> Unhappy with the treatment, black sailors began planning an uprising early in 1910, and chose [[Jo<U+00E3>o C<U+00E2>ndido Felisberto]]<U+2014>an experienced sailor later known as the "Black Admiral"<U+2014>as leader. In mid-November,<ref name=Smallman28/> a sailor was sentenced to be flogged 250 times<ref>Andrews (2004), p. 148</ref> in front of his fellow sailors,<ref name=Smallman28/> even though the practice had been banned by law.<ref name=Scheina74/> The punishment continued even after the sailor fainted.<ref name=Smallman28/> The incident infuriated the nascent mutineers; they were not ready and could not revolt immediately, but they quickened their preparations and rebelled earlier than originally planned, on 21<U+2013>22 November. They murdered several officers and the captain; other officers were forced off the ship. British engineers who had sailed with the ship since its completion were kept as hostages. The mutineers then spread the revolt to ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', the older coastal defense ship ''Deodoro'', and the new cruiser ''Bahia''. During this time, discipline on the rebelling ships was not relaxed; daily drills were conducted and Felisberto ordered all liquor to be thrown overboard.<ref name=Scheina74/>

[[File:E Minas Geraes C.jpeg|thumb|right|''Minas Geraes''{{'}} gun trials; this picture was taken when ten 12-inch guns were trained to port to fire a full [[broadside]]. A ''Scientific American'' article of 1910 remarked that this was "the greatest broadside ever fired from a battleship".<ref name=SA/>]]
The crews of the torpedo boats remained loyal to the government,<ref name=Scheina74/> and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers;<ref name=Smallman28/> a major problem for the authorities was that many of the men who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause.<ref name=Scheina74/> The additional possibility of the capital being bombarded forced the [[National Congress of Brazil]] to give in to the rebels' demands.<ref name=Smallman28/> The demands included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of [[amnesty]] to all mutineers.<ref name=Scheina74/><ref>Smallman (2002), p. 28</ref> The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret. Its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26&nbsp;November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy. However, the government passed a decree on 28&nbsp;November that allowed the Minister of the Navy to expel any sailor who was "undermining discipline"; this act was seen by many sailors as a removal of their previous amnesty.<ref>Smallman (2002), pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref>

In 1913, ''Minas Geraes'' took the Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Lauro M<U+00FC>ller|Lauro Severiano M<U+00FC>ller]], to the United States, reciprocating the visit [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Elihu Root]] had paid to Brazil seven years earlier.<ref>{{Cite news| date = 12 July 1913| title = Brazilian Envoy Host on Warship| work = The New York Times| page = 7| url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D02EEDE163DE633A25751C1A9619C946296D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| date = 18 June 1913| title = Tell Brazil's Envoy of Trade Problems; Exporters Give Loving Cup to Dr. Muller and Welcome Him to Country.| work = The New York Times| page = 14| url =http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9406E4DF153FE633A2575BC1A9609C946296D6CF| format = PDF}}</ref>

== First World War ==
Even though the [[World War I|First World War]] did not touch Brazilian soil, it had crushing effects on Brazil's economy.<ref name=Schenia35-36>Scheina (2003), pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref> Prices for rubber and coffee plummeted; the war had only a small need for rubber, and Britain allowed no coffee into Europe as space on merchant ships was reserved for "essential items". In addition, coffee was declared to be [[contraband]], so every Brazilian shipment to the [[Central Powers]] was subject to search and seizure; even shipments to some neutral countries were barred to ensure that no coffee would get through. Despite these restrictions, neutral<ref group=A>Brazil officially declared its neutrality on 4 August 1914. See: Scheina (2003), pp. 35<U+2013>36.</ref> Brazil was pro-Allied for the first three years of the war because of its sizable merchant fleet; as merchantmen from Allied countries were sunk, Brazilian ships were able to take over routes that had been vacated. This policy exposed them to attack by German submarines, and after the German declaration of [[unrestricted submarine warfare (February 1917)|unrestricted submarine warfare]] in February 1917, several Brazilian ships were sunk, driving the country closer to declaring war on the Central Powers.<ref name=Schenia35-36/>

[[File:Minas Geraes coaling.jpg|thumb|left|''Minas Geraes'' taking on coal at an unknown date]]
Brazil revoked its neutrality in the war between the United States and Germany on 1 June 1917, but did not declare war. At the same time, all German merchant ships interned in Brazilian harbors, 45 in all, were boarded and seized; most were unusable due to neglect or sabotage. On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again stopped short of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.<ref>Scheina (2003), p. 36</ref>

The Brazilian Navy was sent out to patrol the South Atlantic with French, British and American naval units, even though none of its ships had anti-submarine capabilities and, not being at war with the Central Powers, its ships were not supposed to engage any threat outside territorial waters.<ref name=Schenia353738>Scheina (2003), pp. 35, 37<U+2013>38</ref> However, another Brazilian merchant ship, {{SS|Macao||2}},<ref>{{cite Uboat.net | name = Macao | id = 3798 | type = 1ship | accessdate = 28 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite Miramar | id = 5603380 | shipname = Macao | accessdate = 12 June 2009 }}</ref> was sunk off Spain on 18 October, and eight days later Brazil declared war.<ref name=Schenia353738/>

Brazil offered to send ''Minas Geraes'' and ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' to serve with the [[British Grand Fleet]], but this offer was declined because both ships were in poor condition and lacked modern [[fire-control system]]s. Indicative of their poor condition, fourteen of ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''{{'}}s eighteen boilers failed when she sailed to New York for a modernization in June 1918.<ref name=Whitley28>Whitley (1999), p. 28</ref>

In July 1922, ''Minas Geraes'' joined ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' in helping to quash the first of the [[Tenente revolts]], in which the garrison of Rio de Janeiro's [[18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt|Copacabana Fort rebelled]] and began bombarding the city. ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' shelled the fort, and the rebels surrendered shortly thereafter; ''Minas Geraes'' did not fire her guns.<ref name=BrazilNavy2>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval.com.br/historia/SP_x_Copacabana/SP_x_Copacabana_p2.htm|title=Um encoura<U+00E7>ado contra o forte: 2<U+00AA> Parte|author=Guilherme Poggio|date=n.d.|publisher=Poder Naval Online|language=Portuguese|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref>

In 1924, ''Minas Geraes'' was involved in another mutiny, but remained on the side of the government. First Lieutenant [[Hercolino Cascardo]], seven second lieutenants and others commandeered ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' in Rio de Janeiro's harbor on 4 November 1924. Their goal was to force the government to release prisoners who had participated in the 1922 Tenente revolts from confinement aboard the [[prison ship]] ''Cuibaba''; however, the mutineers' demands were not met. ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo''{{'}}s boilers were then fired, and she "steamed menacingly" around ''Minas Geraes'' in an attempt to entice her and other ships to join the rebellion. However, ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'' was only able to sway one old [[torpedo boat]] to her cause. Her crew, angry that ''Minas Geraes'' would not join them, shot a six-pounder at ''Minas Geraes'', wounding a cook. The mutineers then sailed out of the harbor, exchanging shots with forts at the entrance along the way, and set course for [[Montevideo]], Uruguay. The condensers failed along the way, and they reached Montevideo on 10 November making only {{convert|9|knots|km/h}}. The rebellious members of the crew disembarked and were granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]], while the remainder re-hoisted the [[Colours, standards and guidons|colors]] of Brazil.<ref name=Whitley29>Whitley (1999), p. 29</ref><ref name=Bennighoff>{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Brazil_Dreadnoughts.php|title=Brazil's Dreadnoughts|accessdate=16 April 2009|last=Bennighof|first=Mike|date=October 2006|publisher=Avalanche Press}}</ref><ref>Scheina (2003), p. 129</ref>

Between June 1931 and 1935, ''Minas Geraes'' was totally reconstructed and modernized at the [[Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard]]. She was converted from her old coal<U+2013>oil combination to all-oil firing. All eighteen of the original Babcock and Wilcox boilers were removed in favor of six new [[Thornycroft]] boilers. The former No. 1 boiler room and all twelve of the side coal bunkers were converted to fuel oil storage tanks; the upper coal bunkers were removed. In addition, ''Minas Geraes''{{'}} [[dynamo]]s were replaced with new [[Turbo generator|turbogenerators]]. The most striking aesthetic change was the trunking of the boiler uptakes into a single funnel. The fire-control systems that had been fitted after the First World War were also modernized in favor of [[Zeiss-Jena]] range-finders. The guns were overhauled; two extra {{convert|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns were added (making 14 total), and six {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} Madsen guns were installed, including two on the top of 'X' turret. The maximum elevation of the 12-inch guns was upped from 13<U+00B0> to 18<U+00B0>.<ref name=Whitley27/><ref name="Conways 1980">Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), p. 416</ref>

== Second World War and later career ==

As in the First World War, Brazil was neutral during the early years of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. However, German attacks on Brazilian merchant ships pushed the country into war on the Allied side; Brazil declared war on 21 August 1942, taking effect on 31 August.<ref>Scheina (2003), p. 162<U+2013>164</ref>

Apart from three destroyers launched in 1940 and four submarines from the inter-war years,<ref name=Scheina164/><ref group=A>Of the four modern submarines, there was a mine-laying submarine (''Humaita'') completed in 1927 and three submarines (''Tupi'', ''Tamoio'' and ''Timbira'') completed in 1937; all were built by Italy. However, according to author Robert Schenia, these "were of limited operational value". See: Schenia (2003), p. 164. In addition, five [[G and H class destroyer|''Juruena'' class destroyers]] were laid down in Britain in 1939, but were appropriated for use by the [[Royal Navy]] at the start of the war. Another three destroyers, of the {{Sclass|Marcilio Dias|destroyer|4}}, were built in Brazil (and so were not appropriated); these were launched in 1940. See: Gardiner and Chesneau (1980), pp. 416<U+2013>417.</ref> Brazil's warships were old and mostly obsolete pre-First World War vessels.<ref name=Scheina164>Scheina (2003), p. 164</ref> The mainstays of the fleet, ''Minas Geraes'', ''S<U+00E3>o Paulo'', ''Bahia'', and ''Rio Grande do Sul'', were all over thirty years old.<ref name=Scheina164/><ref>Gardiner and Gray (1984), pp. 404<U+2013>405</ref>  Although ''Minas Geraes'' had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, she was still too old and in too poor a condition to "play an active role" in the Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] for the duration.<ref name=Whitley29/><ref name=Scheina164/>

''Minas Geraes'' was inactive for much of the rest of her career. Although she was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] on 16 May 1952, she was used as a stationary headquarters for the Commander-in-Chief of the Brazilian Navy until 17 December of that year. She was removed from the naval register on 31 December,<ref name=Whitley29/> and sold to the Italian [[ship breaking]] company SA Cantiere Navale de Santa Maria.<ref name=BrazilNavy/> She was taken under tow on 1 March 1954 and arrived in [[Genoa]] on 22 April;<ref name=Whitley29/> ''Minas Geraes'' was broken up later that year.<ref name=Miramar/>
