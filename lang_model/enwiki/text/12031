The '''secondary palate''' is an anatomical structure that divides the [[nasal cavity]] from the [[mouth|oral cavity]] in many [[vertebrate]]s. 

In human [[embryology]], it refers to that portion of the [[hard palate]] that is formed by the growth of the two palatine shelves medially and their mutual fusion in the midline. It forms the majority of the adult palate and meets the [[primary palate]] at the [[incisive foramen]]. 

==Clinical significance==
[[Secondary palate development]] begins in the sixth week of [[pregnancy]] and can lead to [[cleft palate]] when it goes awry. 

There are three major mechanisms known to cause this failure:
#Growth retardation - Palatal shelves do not grow enough to meet each other.
#Mechanical obstruction - Improper mouth size, or abnormal anatomical structures in the embryonic mouth prevent fully grown shelves from meeting each other.
