'''Richard Clarke Cabot'''  (1868-1939) was an influential American physician who was intricately involved in the creation of [[social work]].  
==Family History==
His paternal grandfather Samuel Cabot became a sailor at age 19 and married Elizabeth Perkins, daughter of a very successful Boston trader.  Samuel later took over the running of the firm.  His son, James Cabot, studied philosophy in Europe and taught it at Havard.  He also trained as a lawyer and biographer, and was a friend of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].  He married Elizabeth, and both held [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] views.  This philosophy, as well as his parent's strong commitment to philanthropy had a strong influence of Richard.  Around the end of the 19th Century, such ideals were out of favour, with the dominant beleifs at the time being [[social darwinism]] <ref name=gehlert>Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A. Browne (2006). Chapter Two: The Conceptual Underpinnings of social work in health care. ''Handbook of Health Social Work''. New Jersey:WILEY</ref>.
==Professional Career==
Cabot studied Philosophy at Harvard before switching to medicine.  Inspired by the beleifs of [[John Dewey]], Cabot felt more drawn to action than contemplation, and he admired the work of [[Teddy Roosevelt and [[Jane Addams]].  After completing his studies in [[1892]], he turned downt the role of the first [[bacteriology|bacteriologist]] at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] to work in the hospital's much less prestigous outpatient department.  At this time, outpatient wards dealt mostly with people who could afford inpatient treatment, or for the treatment of uncurable chronic conditions such [[tuberculosis]] or [[diabetes]].  This invovled working populations who lived in unhealthy, overcrowded accomodation, often recent migrants. <ref name=gehlert />

He changed the way that the outpatient department was run, beleiving that economic, social, family and psychological conditions underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with.  He envisaged that social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health.  In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.  In 1905 Cabot created one of the first positions of  professional [[Social workers|social worker]] in the world, given to Garnet Pelton, and then to Ida Cannon <ref>Beder, J. (2006).Hospital Social Work: The interface of medicine and caring. Routlege: New York</ref>. The hospital refused to support the hiring of social workers, and Cabot had to pay their wages himself.  Pelten developed tuberculosis herself soon after taking up the position and was forced to retire.  Cannon stayed in the position for fourty years and became Head of Social Work at the hospital.  Cabot and Cannon pioneered many programs to improve the health of patients, including art classes for psychiatric patients, low-cost meals for patients and research on the social factors that increased a person's liklihood of developing tuberculosis<ref name=gehlert />.

In 1917 Cabot took up a position in the [[Medical Reserve Corps]] for a year.  He returned briefly to Massachusetts General Hospital in 1918 and then left to take up the postion of chair at Havard's Department of Social Ethics in 1919.  At this time, the hospital agreed to pay the wages of social workers, as up to this point, Cabot had paid the wages of thirteen social workers over the last 12 years<ref name=gehlert />.  He went on to write about his experiences in his book ''Social Work''<ref>Cabot, R.C. (1919).Social Work. http://books.google.com/books?id=acDjrZh_zdsC</ref>.  He is also credited with discovering [[Cabot rings]].
