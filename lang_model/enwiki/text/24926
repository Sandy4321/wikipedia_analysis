[[Image:UltrasoundBPH.jpg|thumb|right|[[Urinary bladder]] (black butterfly-like shape) and hyperplastic prostate (BPH) visualized by [[Medical ultrasonography]] technique]]
A healthy [[human]] prostate is classically said to be slightly larger than a [[walnut]]. The mean weight of the "normal" prostate in adult males is about 11&nbsp;grams, usually ranging between 7 and 16&nbsp;grams.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Leissner KH, Tisell LE |title=The weight of the human prostate |journal=Scand.

The secretory epithelium is mainly pseudostratified, comprising tall columnar cells and basal cells which are supported by a fibroelastic stroma containing randomly orientated smooth muscle bundles. The epithelium is highly variable and areas of low cuboidal or squamous epithelium are also present, with transitional epithelium in the distal regions of the longer ducts.<ref name="titleAn overview of Prostate Development">{{cite web|url=http://www.ana.ed.ac.uk/database/prosbase/prosdev.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030430000050/http://www.ana.ed.ac.uk/database/prosbase/prosdev.html |archivedate=2003-04-30 |title=Prostate Gland Development|accessdate=2011-08-03 |work=ana.ed.ac.uk}}</ref>
Within the prostate, the urethra coming from the bladder is called the [[prostatic urethra]] and merges with the two [[ejaculatory duct]]s.

The prostate can be divided in two ways: by zone, or by lobe.<ref name="titleInstant Anatomy - Abdomen - Vessels - Veins - Prostatic plexus">{{cite web |url=http://www.instantanatomy.net/abdomen/vessels/vprostaticplexus.html |title=Instant Anatomy <U+2013> Abdomen <U+2013> Vessels <U+2013> Veins <U+2013> Prostatic plexus |accessdate=2007-11-23 |work=}}</ref> It does not have a capsule, rather an integral fibromuscular band surrounds it.<ref>{{cite pmid|18828961 }}</ref> It is sheathed in the muscles of the pelvic floor, which contract during the ejaculatory process.

===Zones===
The "zone" classification is more often used in [[pathology]]. The idea of "zones" was first proposed by McNeal in 1968. McNeal found that the relatively homogeneous cut surface of an adult prostate in no way resembled "lobes" and thus led to the description of "zones".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Myers, Robert P|pmid=10797630|year=2000|title=Structure of the adult prostate from a clinician's standpoint|volume=13|issue=3|pages=214<U+2013>5|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2353(2000)13:3<214::AID-CA10>3.0.CO;2-N|journal=Clinical anatomy}}</ref>

The prostate gland has four distinct glandular regions, two of which arise from different segments of the prostatic urethra:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Name''' || '''Fraction of gland''' || '''Description''' 
 |- 
 | Peripheral zone (PZ) || Up to 70% in young men || The sub-capsular portion of the posterior aspect of the prostate gland that surrounds the distal [[urethra]]. It is from this portion of the gland that ~70<U+2013>80% of [[prostatic cancers]] originate.<ref name="urologymatch1">[http://www.urologymatch.com/ProstateAnatomy.htm "Basic Principals: Prostate Anatomy"].

Web. 14 June 2010.</ref>
 |- 
 | Central zone (CZ) || Approximately 25% normally || This zone surrounds the [[ejaculatory ducts]]. The central zone accounts for roughly 2.5% of prostate cancers although these cancers tend to be more aggressive and more likely to invade the seminal vesicles.<ref name="pmid18343454">{{cite journal |author=Cohen RJ, Shannon BA, Phillips M, Moorin RE, Wheeler TM, Garrett KL |title=Central zone carcinoma of the prostate gland: a distinct tumor type with poor prognostic features |journal=The Journal of Urology |volume=179 |issue=5 |pages=1762<U+2013>7; discussion 1767 |year=2008|pmid=18343454 |doi=10.1016/j.juro.2008.01.017 }}</ref>
 |- 
 | Transition zone (TZ) || 5% at puberty || ~10<U+2013>20% of prostate cancers originate in this zone. The transition zone surrounds the proximal urethra and is the region of the prostate gland that grows throughout life and is responsible for the disease of [[benign prostatic enlargement]]. (2)<ref name="urologymatch1"/><ref name="prostate-cancer1"/>
 |- 
 | Anterior fibro-muscular zone (or stroma) || Approximately 5% || This zone is usually devoid of glandular components, and composed only, as its name suggests, of [[muscle]] and [[fibrous tissue]].
|}

===Lobes===

The "lobe" classification is more often used in anatomy.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Anterior lobe (or isthmus) || roughly corresponds to part of transitional zone
 |- 
 | Posterior lobe || roughly corresponds to peripheral zone 
 |- 
 | Lateral lobes || spans all zones
 |- 
 | Median lobe (or middle lobe) || roughly corresponds to part of central zone
|}

==Physiology==

===Function===
The function of the prostate is to secrete a slightly alkaline fluid, milky or white in appearance,<ref name="http://ajplegacy.physiology.org">{{cite journal|journal=Am J Physiol |year=1942 |volume=136|issue=3|pages= 467<U+2013>473  |url=http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/cgi/pdf_extract/136/3/467 |title=Chemical composition of human semen and of the secretions of the prostate and seminal vehicles
}}</ref> that usually constitutes 50<U+2013>75% of the volume of the [[semen]] along with [[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] and [[seminal vesicle]] fluid.<ref name="http://ajplegacy.physiology.org"/> Semen is made alkaline overall with the secretions from the other contributing glands, including, at least, the seminal vesicle fluid.  The alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. The alkalinization of semen is primarily accomplished through secretion from the seminal vesicles.<ref>

}}
</ref> The prostatic fluid is expelled in the first [[ejaculate]] fractions, together with most of the spermatozoa. In comparison with the few spermatozoa expelled together with mainly seminal vesicular fluid, those expelled in prostatic fluid have better [[motility]], longer survival and better protection of the genetic material.

The prostate also contains some [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]]s that help expel semen during [[ejaculation]].

====Male sexual response====
{{main|Prostate massage}}
During male [[ejaculation]], sperm is transmitted from the ductus deferens into the male urethra via the ejaculatory ducts, which lie within the prostate gland. It is possible for men to achieve [[orgasm]] solely through stimulation of the prostate gland, such as prostate massage or receptive [[Anal sex|anal intercourse]].<ref name="Prostate/Hot spot">{{cite web|title= The male hot spot <U+2014> Massaging the prostate|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=2002-09-27 (Last Updated/Reviewed on 2008-03-28)|accessdate=2010-04-21|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/male-hot-spot-massaging-prostate }}</ref><ref name="Rosenthal">{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133<U+2013>135|accessdate = September 17, 2012| isbn = 0618755713|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&pg=PT153}}</ref><ref name="Answer">{{cite book|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 0-8018-9396-8|publisher=JHU Press|year=2009|pages=108<U+2013>109|accessdate=6 November 2011|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&pg=PA108|author =Komisaruk, Barry R.; Whipple, Beverly; Nasserzadeh, Sara and Beyer-Flores, Carlos }}</ref>

====Secretions====
Prostatic secretions vary among species. They are generally composed of simple sugars and are often slightly [[acid]]ic. In human prostatic secretions, the protein content is less than 1% and includes [[proteolytic enzyme]]s, [[prostatic acid phosphatase]], [[MSMB|beta-microseminoprotein]], and [[prostate-specific antigen]]. The secretions also contain [[zinc]] with a concentration 500<U+2013>1,000 times the concentration in blood.

===Development===
The prostatic part of the urethra develops from the ''pelvic'' (middle) part of the [[urogenital sinus]] (endodermal origin). [[Endodermal]] outgrowths arise from the prostatic part of the urethra and grow into the surrounding [[mesenchyme]]. The glandular epithelium of the prostate differentiates from these endodermal cells, and the associated mesenchyme differentiates into the dense [[stroma (animal tissue)|stroma]] and the [[Smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]] of the prostate.<ref>Moore, Keith L.; Persaud, T. V. N. and Torchia, Mark G. (2008) ''Before We Are Born, Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects'', 7th edition, Saunders Elsevier, ISBN 978-1-4160-3705-7</ref> The prostate glands represent the modified wall of the proximal portion of the male urethra and arises by the 9th week of embryonic life in the [[development of the reproductive system]]. Condensation of [[mesenchyme]], [[urethra]] and [[Wolffian duct]]s gives rise to the adult prostate gland, a composite organ made up of several glandular and non-glandular components tightly fused.

===Regulation===
To function properly, the prostate needs male [[hormones]] ([[testosterone]]s), which are responsible for male [[sex]] characteristics. The main male hormone is [[testosterone]], which is produced mainly by the [[testicle]]s. Some male hormones are produced in small amounts by the [[adrenal gland]]s. However, it is [[dihydrotestosterone]] that regulates the prostate.

==Prostate disorders==

===Prostatitis===
{{main|Prostatitis}}
[[Image:Inflammation of prostate.jpg|thumb|right| [[Micrograph]] showing an [[inflammation|inflamed]] prostate gland, the [[histology|histologic]] correlate of '''prostatitis'''. A normal non-inflamed prostatic gland is seen on the left of the image. [[H&E stain]].]]
[[Prostatitis]] is [[inflammation]] of the prostate gland. There are primarily four different forms of prostatitis, each with different causes and outcomes. Two relatively uncommon forms, acute prostatitis and chronic bacterial prostatitis, are treated with [[antibiotic]]s (category I and II, respectively). Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis or male chronic pelvic pain syndrome (category III), which comprises about 95% of prostatitis diagnoses, is treated by a large variety of modalities including [[alpha blockers]], [[phytotherapy]], [[physical therapy]], [[psychotherapy]], [[antihistamine]]s, [[anxiolytic]]s, [[nerve modulator]]s, [[surgery]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ProstatitisSurgery.com|title=Video post-op interviews with prostatitis surgery patients  |work=ProstatitisSurgery.com}}</ref> and more.<ref name="cpcom">{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicprostatitis.com/meds.html|title=Pharmacological treatment options for prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome|work=chronicprostatitis.com|accessdate=2006-12-11|year=2006}}</ref> More recently, a combination of [[trigger point]] and psychological therapy has proved effective for category III prostatitis as well.<ref name="pmid16952676">{{cite journal |author=Anderson RU, Wise D, Sawyer T, Chan CA |title=Sexual dysfunction in men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome: improvement after trigger point release and paradoxical relaxation training |journal=J.

===Benign prostatic hyperplasia===
{{main|Benign prostatic hyperplasia}}
[[Benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (BPH) occurs in older men;<ref name="pmid">{{cite journal |author=Verhamme KM, Dieleman JP, Bleumink GS, ''et al.'' |title=Incidence and prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care<U+2014>the Triumph project |journal=Eur.

Symptoms include needing to [[urination|urinate]] often (frequency) or taking a while to get started (hesitancy). If the prostate grows too large, it may constrict the urethra and impede the flow of urine, making urination difficult and painful and, in extreme cases, completely impossible.

BPH can be treated with medication, a [[minimally invasive procedure]] or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. Minimally invasive procedures include [[transurethral needle ablation of the prostate]] (TUNA) and [[transurethral microwave thermotherapy]] (TUMT).<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Christensen| first = TL| last2 = Andriole| first2 = GL| title = Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Current Treatment Strategies| journal = Consultant| volume = 49| issue = 2| date = February 2009| year = 2009| url = http://www.consultantlive.com/display/article/10162/1376744}}</ref> These outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary [[prostatic stent]], to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.<ref name="pmid18374395">{{cite journal |author=Dineen MK, Shore ND, Lumerman JH, Saslawsky MJ, Corica AP |title=Use of a Temporary Prostatic Stent After Transurethral Microwave Thermotherapy Reduced Voiding Symptoms and Bother Without Exacerbating Irritative Symptoms |journal=J.

The surgery most often used in such cases is called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP or TUR). In TURP, an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate tissue that is pressing against the upper part of the [[urethra]] and restricting the flow of [[urine]]. TURP results in the removal of mostly transitional zone tissue in a patient with BPH. Older men often have ''corpora amylacea''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ouhsc.edu/histology/Glass%20slides/33_09.jpg |title=Slide 33: Prostate, at ouhsc.edu |accessdate= |work=}}</ref> ([[amyloid]]), dense accumulations of calcified proteinaceous material, in the ducts of their prostates. The corpora amylacea may obstruct the lumens of the prostatic ducts, and may underlie some cases of BPH.

Urinary frequency due to bladder spasm, common in older men, may be confused with prostatic hyperplasia. 
[[Epidemiology|Statistical observations]] suggest that a diet low in [[dietary fat|fat]] and [[red meat]] and high in [[protein]] and [[vegetables]], as well as regular [[alcohol consumption]], could protect against BPH.<ref name="pmid18263602">{{cite journal |author=Kristal AR, Arnold KB, Schenk JM, ''et al.'' |title=Dietary patterns, supplement use, and the risk of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: results from the prostate cancer prevention trial |journal=Am.

===Prostate cancer===

[[Prostate cancer]] is one of the most common [[cancer]]s affecting older men in [[developed countries]] and a significant cause of [[death]] for elderly men (estimated by some specialists at 3%{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}). Despite this, the [[American Cancer Society]]'s position regarding early detection is "Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment" and that they believe "that men should not be tested without learning about what we know and don<U+2019>t know about the risks and possible benefits of testing and treatment. Starting at age 50 (age 45 if you are of Black race or if your father or brother acquired prostate cancer before age 65), talk to your doctor about the pros and cons of testing so you can decide if testing is the right choice for you".<ref>[http://www.cancer.org/healthy/findcancerearly/cancerscreeningguidelines/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer American Cancer Society American Cancer Society Guidelines for the early detection of cancer Cited: September 2011].

If checks are performed, they can be in the form of a physical [[rectal exam]], measurement of [[prostate specific antigen]] (PSA) level in the blood, or checking for the presence of the protein [[EN2 (gene)|Engrailed-2]] (EN2) in the urine.

Co-researchers Hardev Pandha and Richard Morgan published their findings regarding checking for [[EN2 (gene)|EN2]] in urine in the 1 March 2011 issue of the journal [[Clinical Cancer Research]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2410|title= Engrailed-2 (EN2): A Tumor Specific Urinary Biomarker for the Early Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer|year= 2011|last1= Morgan|first1= R.|last2= Boxall|first2= A.|last3= Bhatt|first3= A.|last4= Bailey|first4= M.|last5= Hindley|first5= R.|last6= Langley|first6= S.|last7= Whitaker|first7= H.

According to Morgan, "We are preparing several large studies in the UK and in the US and although the EN2 test is not yet available, several companies have expressed interest in taking it forward."<ref>[http://www.medicinechest.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=543 New prostate cancer twice as effective as a PSA test could be available by next year]. medicinechest.co.uk (2 March 2011)</ref>

==Interventions==

===Unclogging a prostate===
A surgeon can unclog a blocked prostate by inserting a temporary or permanent artificial [[stent]] via the urethra. This is mostly done on an outpatient basis under local or spinal anesthesia and takes about 30 minutes.

==Vasectomy and risk of prostate cancer==
In 1983, the Journal of the American Medical Association reported a connection between [[vasectomy]] and an increased risk of [[prostate cancer]]. Reported studies of 48,000 and 29,000 men who had vasectomies showed 66 percent and 56 percent higher rates of prostate cancer, respectively. The risk increased with age and the number of years since the vasectomy was performed.

However, in March of the same year, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development held a conference cosponsored by the National Cancer Institute and others to review the available data and information on the link between prostate cancer and vasectomies. It was determined that an association between the two was very weak at best, and even if having a vasectomy increased one's risk, the risk was relatively small.

In 1997, the NCI held a conference with the prostate cancer Progressive Review Group (a committee of scientists, medical personnel, and others). Their final report, published in 1998 stated that evidence that vasectomies help to develop prostate cancer was weak at best.<ref>{{cite web |title=Defeating Prostate Cancer: Crucial Directions for Research |url=http://planning.cancer.gov/library/1998prostate.pdf |year=August 1998 |publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]] |accessdate=2012-08-19}}</ref>

==Female prostate gland==
The [[Skene's gland]], also known as the paraurethral gland, found in females, is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the prostate gland in males. However, anatomically, the [[uterus]] is in the same position as the prostate gland. In 2002 the Skene's gland was officially renamed to female prostate by the ''Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology''.<ref name=seattletimes/>

The female prostate, like the male prostate, secretes [[Prostate specific antigen|PSA]] and levels of this antigen rise in the presence of carcinoma of the gland. The gland also expels fluid, like the male prostate, during [[orgasm]].<ref name="pmid8004685">{{cite journal |author=Kratochv<U+00ED>l S |title=Orgasmic expulsions in women |language=Czech |journal=<U+010C>esk Psychiatr |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=71<U+2013>7 |year=1994|pmid=8004685}}</ref>
