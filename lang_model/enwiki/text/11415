The 6,543-yard, par-72, George Veenker Memorial Golf Course is located just two blocks north of the Iowa State campus.  The 18-hole course was constructed in 1938 from the design of world renowned golf course architect, [[Perry Maxwell]] (re-designer of the seventh and 10th holes at Augusta National Golf Club in 1937.
).  The golf course was built with WPA and Athletic Council funds, and cost $122,373.<ref>[http://www.public.iastate.edu/~isu150/history/timeline-1925.html History of Iowa State: Time Line, 1925<U+2013>1949] <U+2013> 1938</ref> The course hosted the conference championships in 1982 and 1989, two regional [[AIAW]] championships, and hosts the annual [[Iowa Masters]] Championship.  It also hosted the 1949 [[NCAA]] national championship, in which [[Arnold Palmer]] was a participant.  Numerous efforts have been made over the past ten years to improve the practice area, which has resulted in over $200,000 worth of additions and improvements.<ref>[http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=46691&SPID=4256&DB_OEM_ID=10700&ATCLID=541512 Veenker Memorial Golf Course]</ref>
