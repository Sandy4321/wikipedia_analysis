'''Jean-Francois Hodoul''' ([[1766]]-[[1835]]) was a [[corsair]] who worked in the employ of the [[France|French government]]. In the [[1790s]] he was primarily a captain transporting slaves from [[Africa]] to the [[Indian Ocean]] colonies of Ile Bourbon ([[R<U+00E9>union]]) and Ile de France ([[Mauritius]]).

In [[1797]] he is credited with capturing and plundering seven British ships, in which he amassed a large amount of treasure consisting of pearls, piasters and gold. In [[1800]] he was captured by the British and imprisoned in Calcutta. He was released after the [[Treaty of Amiens]] in [[1802]].
After his release, he settled on [[Mahe Island]] in the [[Seychelles]]. There he became a wealthy businessman and plantation owner. He owned several ships which traded goods between the Seychelles and Mauritius.

Today in the harbor of [[Victoria, Seychelles|Victoria]], Mahe is a small islet named for him; <U+201C>Ile Hodoul<U+201D>. Also legend has it that Hodoul's treasure is buried on [[Silhouette Island]], northwest of Mahe.
