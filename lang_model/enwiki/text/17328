'''Hurricane Carlotta''' was a minimal hurricane that briefly affected southwestern Mexico with light rainfall in July 2006. The second hurricane and fourth [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2006 Pacific hurricane season]], Carlotta developed on July&nbsp;12 from a [[tropical wave]] off the southwest coast of Mexico. It quickly attained hurricane status, though nearby [[Hurricane Bud (2006)|Hurricane Bud]] caused the hurricane to weaken. Carlotta briefly weakened to tropical storm status before again reaching hurricane status, though on July&nbsp;15 it began its final weakening trend due to cooler waters and [[wind shear]]. On July&nbsp;17 it degenerated into a remnant [[low pressure area]], and four days later the circulation dissipated.

{{storm path|Carlotta 2006 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of Africa on June&nbsp;30, 2006, and it moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little [[convection (meteorology)|convection]]. On July&nbsp;9, while crossing Central America into the eastern North Pacific Ocean, thunderstorm activity increased.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=James Franklin|date=2006-09-04|title=Hurricane Carlotta Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP042006_Carlotta.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Late the next day a broad [[low pressure area]] developed about 290&nbsp;[[mile|mi]] (465&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) south of [[Puerto <U+00C1>ngel]], [[Oaxaca]]; around the same time, convection was diminishing, although forecasters at the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) noted its potential for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] over the subsequent days while paralleling the Mexican coastline.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robbie Berg|date=2006-07-10|title=Tropical Weather Discussion|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=ftp://ftp.met.fsu.edu/pub/weather/tropical/Pac-Dis/2006071021.AXPZ20}}</ref> The thunderstorms increased around the low on July&nbsp;11, and by 0000&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on July&nbsp;12 it was sufficiently well-organized to be designated Tropical Depression Four-E; at the time, it was located about 290&nbsp;mi (465&nbsp;km) south of [[Zihuatanejo]], [[Guerrero]].<ref name="tcr"/>

Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving quickly west-northwestward to the south of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over northwestern Mexico. It was a large cyclone, and initially its outer rainbands moved across the coast of Mexico.<ref name="tcr"/> The depression had good [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]], and its primary inhibiting factor was its large size.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stacy Stewart|date=2006-07-12|title=Tropical Depression Four-E Discussion One|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep04/ep042006.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> After an increase in convection over the center, the depression intensified into a tropical storm just six hours after forming; at this time, the NHC named the storm Carlotta.<ref name="tcr"/> With low [[wind shear]] and warm water temperatures, as well as the development of an inner core, fairly [[rapid deepening|rapid intensification]] was expected.<ref>{{cite web|author=Blake/Knabb|date=2006-07-12|title=Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Two|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep04/ep042006.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> By late on July&nbsp;12, the storm developed [[tropical cyclone#physical structure|banding features]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Pasch|date=2006-07-12|title=Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Four|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep04/ep042006.discus.004.shtml?}}</ref> and early on July&nbsp;13 Carlotta attained hurricane status about 430&nbsp;mi (700&nbsp;km) south of [[Cabo San Lucas]] on the southern tip of the [[Baja California peninsula]].<ref name="tcr"/>

As Hurricane Carlotta intensified, the system became more compact, and it reached peak winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> An [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] formed in the center of the convection, and the hurricane was briefly forecast to attain [[tropical cyclone scales|major hurricane]] status, or a Category&nbsp;3 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Blake/Knabb|date=2006-07-13|title=Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Six|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep04/ep042006.discus.006.shtml?}}</ref> However, Carlotta did not intensify further due to increased wind shear from [[Hurricane Bud (2006)|Hurricane Bud]] to its west.<ref name="tcr"/> It began weakening on July&nbsp;14, as its eye became poorly-defined and its convection decreased in coverage.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jack Beven|date=2006-07-14|title=Hurricane Carlotta Discussion Nine|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep04/ep042006.discus.009.shtml?}}</ref> The northern portion of the circulation moved across an area of cooler waters, and Carlotta briefly weakened to tropical storm status late on July&nbsp;14. However, a decrease in wind shear caused the convection to rebuild and for the eye to reform, allowing the storm to re-attain hurricane status early on July&nbsp;15. The re-intensification was short-lived, as the center of the hurricane moved into the area of cooler waters; the eye disappeared, and Carlotta again weakened to tropical storm status.<ref name="tcr"/> Late on July&nbsp;15, the circulation became separated from the convection,<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhome/Avila|date=2006-07-15|title=Tropical Storm Carlotta Discussion Sixteen|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep04/ep042006.discus.016.shtml?}}</ref> and by the next day the circulation was largely devoid of any thunderstorms;<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhome/Stewart|date=2006-07-16|title=Tropical Depression Carlotta Discussion Nineteen|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/ep04/ep042006.discus.019.shtml?}}</ref> it weakened to tropical depression status at 1200&nbsp;UTC. By July&nbsp;17, after being unable to generate any convection, Carlotta degenerated into a remnant low. The circulation continued generally westward, dissipating on July&nbsp;20 about 1500&nbsp;mi (2400&nbsp;km) east of the Hawaiian islands.<ref name="tcr"/>

== Impact ==
When Carlotta was first forming, its outer rainbands brought light rainfall along the Pacific coast of Mexico, from the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]] to around [[Manzanillo, Colima]]. Rainfall totals were less than 1&nbsp;inch (25&nbsp;mm), and there were no reports of tropical storm-force winds over land. No fatalities or damages were reported.<ref name="tcr"/>

The name Carlotta was previously used eight times.<ref name="epachurdat">{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2008|title=Hurricane Data for Pacific Hurricanes 1949-2007|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=2008-11-21|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt}}</ref> Due to the lack of impact, the name ''Carlotta'' was not retired and is scheduled to be used in 2012.<ref name="names">{{cite web|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Names|year=2007|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-17|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml}}</ref>
