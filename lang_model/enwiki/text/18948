"'''There's Something About Marrying'''" is the tenth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 16)|sixteenth season]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the episode, [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] legalizes [[same-sex marriage]] to increase tourism. After becoming a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] starts to wed people to make money. Meanwhile, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s sister [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty]] [[coming out|comes out]] as gay and reveals that she is going to marry a woman named Veronica. Marge originally disapproves of this, making Patty frustrated. When Marge accidentally discovers that Veronica is a man dressed as a woman, she decides to keep quiet about it knowing that Patty will be marrying a man. However, at the ceremony, she is so moved by Patty's [[marriage vows|vow]] that she is forced to reveal Veronica's secret. After the ceremony is canceled, Marge tells Patty that she now accepts her sexuality.

This was the third time that an episode of ''The Simpsons'' focused on homosexuality. The episode<U+2014>written by [[J. Stewart Burns]] and directed by [[Nancy Kruse]]<U+2014>was inspired by the [[San Francisco 2004 same-sex weddings|2004 same-sex weddings that occurred in San Francisco]]. According to executive producer [[Al Jean]], the staff wanted the episode to explore what the different characters' stances on same-sex marriage were. Around the time of the episode's original airdate, February 20, 2005, the same-sex marriage question was a hot political issue in the United States and the episode became controversial. "There's Something About Marrying" received a lot of criticism from conservative groups, including the [[Parents Television Council]] and the [[American Family Association]], that claimed it was promoting gay marriage. Jean stated in response that the staff was not taking a side on the issue and that they were just examining all sides of it. Positive reaction to the episode came from, among others, the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] and the gay-oriented website [[AfterEllen.com]].

During the first airing, 10.5&nbsp;million people watched "There's Something About Marrying" and it became the highest rated episode of the season. The episode had received a lot of publicity in the media before its broadcast<U+2014>not only because of the same-sex marriage controversy but also because of Patty's outing. It was revealed during the summer of 2004 that a character would come out as gay in the episode, leading to much speculation from fans and the press. [[Bookmaker]] websites were even posting [[odds]] on which character it would be, with Patty receiving the best odds.

==Plot==
[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] torment a tourist named Howell Huser, who is then chased out of town by bullies [[Springfield Elementary School students#Dolph|Dolph]], [[Jimbo Jones|Jimbo]], and [[Kearney Zzyzwicz|Kearney]]. Huser is later revealed to be a media personality, and he appears on a network's morning television show warning tourists against visiting [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and giving it his lowest rating for any American location (six out of ten). The Springfield tourism business collapses and [[Joe Quimby|Mayor Quimby]] holds an emergency meeting at the town hall. After many senseless suggestions, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] suggests that Springfield legalize [[same-sex marriage]] to entice visitors to their town.

Hundreds of homosexual couples soon arrive to Springfield. However, [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Reverend Lovejoy]] insists that the Bible forbids same-sex marriage and refuses to marry any gay couples. After discovering [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]s are paid $200 per couple, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] abandons his opposition to the process and decides to become a minister himself with help from the online "e-Piscopal" Church. He marries every gay couple in town, and then puts up a sign saying "Will marry anyone to anything." While debating the issue with Lovejoy on the television show ''[[Media in The Simpsons#Smartline|Smartline]]'', Homer makes a case for gay marriage and mockingly joins the Bible and Lovejoy in [[matrimony]]<U+2014>adding that Lovejoy is the wife and that he owes Homer $200.

Meanwhile, at the [[Simpson family]]'s home, [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty]] [[coming out|comes out of the closet]], saying that she is in love with a pro [[golf]]er named Veronica and asking Homer to perform the ceremony. This makes [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] extremely uncomfortable, even though the evidence was always there. Patty gets angry and points out that Marge acts very liberal about the issue but cannot accept her sister's sexuality, and says she hopes to see Marge at her wedding. Before the wedding, Marge accidentally discovers Veronica is actually a man. Happily she decides to keep quiet about it knowing that Patty will be marrying a man. But Marge is so moved by Patty's heartfelt declaration of love for Veronica during the ceremony that she reveals Veronica's [[Adam's apple]]. "Veronica" explains that as the straight Leslie Robin Swisher, he posed as a woman to get onto the [[LPGA]] golf tour. He then asks Patty if she will still marry him, but she declines. Marge tells Patty that she has learned a lesson and that she now accepts her sexuality, and they hug. Patty and her sister [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma]] then go to leave a bag at the airport unattended, as a way to meet security personnel they can date.

"There's Something About Marrying" was written by co-executive producer [[J. Stewart Burns]] and directed by [[Nancy Kruse]] as part of the sixteenth season of ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{cite web|title=There's Something About Marrying|url=http://ca.tv.yahoo.com/episode/16195/castcrew|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref> Work on the episode started after the [[San Francisco 2004 same-sex weddings|2004 San Francisco same-sex weddings]], a period in early 2004 when the city was issuing [[Marriage license#United States|marriage licenses]] to same-sex couples. This served as the ''Simpsons'' staff's inspiration for "There's Something About Marrying".<ref name=Foust/> The plot point where Springfield tries to increase tourism by marketing towards the [[LGBT]] community also had a basis in reality. An example is [[Fort Lauderdale]], which became a popular tourist destination for gays and lesbians in the mid-2000s.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Pinsky  | first = Mark I. | title = The Gospel According to The Simpsons, Bigger and Possibly Even Better! edition  | publisher = Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky|edition=Second  |year=2007  | isbn = 978-0-664-23160-6|page=192}}</ref> Executive producer [[Al Jean]] said they were interested in doing the episode because they could explore the various characters' different positions on gay marriage while remaining neutral. "Lisa thinks it's good for civil rights. The reverend of the local Protestant church is opposed to it. Other people think tourists will come to town. Mayor Quimby wants the money. We don't take a position as much as explore everybody's positions," he commented.<ref name=Foust>{{cite web|last=Foust|first=Michael|title=Groundbreaking: Homosexuality finding its way into cartoons|url=http://www.sbcbaptistpress.org/bpnews.asp?ID=20009|publisher=[[Baptist Press]]|accessdate=June 20, 2011|date=January 27, 2005}}</ref> 

[[Matt Groening]], the creator of ''The Simpsons'', stated that the staff wanted to out Patty as gay because portraying her as a "love-starved spinster [...] seemed old" on the show.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Advocate: Issues 985-991|year=2007|publisher=Liberation Publications|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qDIEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref> There had previously been hints about Patty's orientation. For example, in the [[The Simpsons (season 13)|season thirteen]] episode "[[Jaws Wired Shut]]" she is part of the Springfield [[Pride parade|Gay Pride Parade]]'s "stayin' in the closet" float, though only her voice was heard and she was not seen.<ref>{{cite book | last = McCann | first = Jesse L. |authorlink=Jesse McCann | coauthors =[[Matt Groening]]| title = [[The Simpsons One Step Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Continued Yet Again]] | publisher = [[HarperCollins]]| date = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-081754-2|pages=28&ndash;29}}</ref>

==Themes and analysis==
The episode's plotline revolves around homosexuality<U+2014>the third time for ''The Simpsons''. The first was [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]]'s "[[Homer's Phobia]]", and the second was "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]" from [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season fourteen]],<ref name=Delingpole/> both of which won [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref> This time it centered on the right for homosexuals to get married and the coming-out of a character. In the episode, Homer is shown as being tolerant with homosexuality, whereas in "Homer's Phobia" he is portrayed as being slightly homophobic.<ref name=Delingpole/> In that episode, the Simpson family gets a new friend that Homer dissociates himself from after finding out that he is gay. He also fears that the friend will have a negative influence on Bart and decides to ensure Bart's heterosexuality by taking him to do manly things such as hunting.<ref name=Delingpole/><ref name=Kiehl/> As James Delingpole of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' writes, it was first after "Homer's Phobia" that Homer began to be portrayed as enlightened about homosexuality.<ref name=Delingpole>{{cite news|last=Delingpole|first=James|title=What 'The Simpsons' can teach us about life|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/6872394/What-The-Simpsons-can-teach-us-about-life.html|accessdate=June 19, 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=January 5, 2010}}</ref> Marge, on the other hand, who had previously been portrayed as supportive of gay people on the show, is seen as disapproving of her sister's sexual orientation.<ref name=AVclubInventory>{{cite web|title=Inventory: 15 Simpsons Moments That Perfectly Captured Their Eras|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/inventory-15-simpsons-moments-that-perfectly-captu,2001/|work=''[[The A.V.

[[File:Ellen DeGeneres-2009.jpg|thumb|upright|The coming-out of [[Ellen DeGeneres]]' character in ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' lead to the appearance of more gay characters on television.]]
According to the publications ''Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture'' and ''Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights'', it was the controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by [[Ellen DeGeneres]]) in the sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in 1997 that paved the way for Patty's coming-out in this episode, as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows.<ref>{{cite book|title=Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture|year=2005|publisher=Metatronics, Inc.|page=78|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LKA7AQAAIAAJ&q=patty+gay+ellen+%22the+simpsons%22&dq=patty+gay+ellen+%22the+simpsons%22&hl=en&ei=PzwHTqeDOYSAOoH6odEN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Brewer>{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Paul Ryan|title=Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights|year=2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780742562110|page=49|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=U34pJTdF-VcC&pg=PA49&dq=patty+gay+%22the+simpsons%22&hl=en&ei=fzAHTsL9NoGcOpay_b8N&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=patty%20gay%20%22the%20simpsons%22&f=false}}</ref> In his book ''Queers in American Popular Culture'', Jim Elledge noted that unlike many episodes of ''The Simpsons'' that go through a situation and then everything returns to normal during the ending, this one does not. He commented that the staff of the show could have made Patty heterosexual again at the end of the episode and leave it how it was before by having her marry Leslie. Instead, they ended it in a way that could potentially be experienced as distasteful to the [[heteronormative]] audience by having Patty exclaim "Hell no! I like girls!" to Leslie's marriage proposal.<ref name=Elledge/> The author also noted that it is possible the ''Simpsons'' staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were "traditionally considered more acceptable" on television. She did, however, not "adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian" that had previously been seen on shows such as ''Ellen''. Instead, Patty is "rude, crude, and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences", and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge.<ref name=Elledge>{{cite book|last=Elledge|first=Jim|title=Queers in American Popular Culture (Volume 2)|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313354571|pages=266<U+2013>269|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qp52mROzDMYC&dq=%22There%27s+Something+About+Marrying%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}</ref> 

Around the episode's original broadcast in early 2005, the same-sex marriage question was one of the hottest political issues in America.<ref name=AVclubInventory/> It had been an especially hot topic during the then-recent presidential election in the United States.<ref name=bbc/> [[Marty Kaplan]], a professor at [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|Annenberg School for Communication]] and radio host on [[Air America Radio]], commented that the episode is telling "those who demonize homosexuality, or what [these people] call the [[homosexual agenda]]," anything from "lighten up" to "get out of town".<ref name="Waxman"/> This was not the first time that an episode of the show had brought up a current issue. Writing in an article about "There's Something About Marrying" for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Sharon Waxman said that "as television's longest-running situation comedy, ''The Simpsons'' is no stranger to hot-button social, religious and political issues, mocking wardrobe malfunctions, Hollywood liberals and born-again Christians, among other targets."<ref name="Waxman"/>

==Speculation, publicity and broadcast==
"There's Something About Marrying" was originally broadcast on February&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2005 in the United States.<ref name="Waxman"/> It was reported a long time in advance of the episode's airing that a major character would come out as gay during the episode. At the [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] convention in July&nbsp;2004, Al Jean revealed: "We have a show where, to raise money, Springfield legalises gay marriage. Homer becomes a minister by going on the internet and filling out a form. A long-time character comes out of the closet, but I'm not saying who."<ref name="bbc"/> This lead to much media speculation and publicity in the press for the episode.<ref name=AVclubInventory/><ref name=ellen>{{cite web|last=Kennerley|first=David|title=Simpsons Episode Offers Fresh, Funny Take on Gay Marriage|url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/TV/2005/2/simpsons.html|publisher=[[AfterEllen.com]]|accessdate=June 19, 2011|date=February 22, 2005}}</ref> The last such "mystery Simpsons storyline", as [[BBC News]] called it, occurred with the "[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]" episode in which it was announced prior to the broadcast that a character would be killed in the episode, leading to weeks of speculation before the revelation that it was [[Maude Flanders]].<ref name="bbc"/> 

There was a widespread debate among fans of the series as to who the character coming out of the closet would be, also similar to how they years earlier debated [[Who Shot Mr. Burns?#Contest|who shot the character Mr. Burns]].<ref name=AVclubInventory/> Matt Groening joked at the Comic-Con convention that "it's Homer".<ref name="bbc">{{Cite news| title = Simpsons to reveal gay character| publisher= [[BBC News]]| date = July 28, 2004 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3932369.stm | accessdate = August 8, 2011}}</ref> Many fans correctly guessed that it would be one of Homer's sisters-in-law, either Patty or Selma, while others believed it to be [[Waylon Smithers]].<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="February21bbc"/> It had for a long time been hinted on the show that the Smithers character was gay and in love with his boss [[Mr. Burns]].

"There's Something About Marrying" featured the first appearance of an animated same-sex marriage on network television.<ref name=White/> Television columnist [[Ray Richmond]] wrote that the episode was a cultural milestone for ''The Simpsons'' and that the "issue [of gay marriage] was mainstream to some degree, but now that [the staff has] deigned it worthy of the show it is interwoven into the popular culture.

Do children need to have gay marriage thrust in their faces as an issue? Why can't we just entertain them?"<ref name="christian"/><ref name="Waxman"/> Similarly, Vitagliano said that many children watch the ''The Simpsons'' and Hollywood "will pull out all the stops to promote same-sex marriage <U+2014> and children will be influenced by it."<ref name=AFA/>

Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder wrote that at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were accustomed to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then.<ref name=Washburn/> The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it.<ref name=Washburn/> In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken."<ref name="ctv">{{Cite web |last = Tomlinson | first=Kathy | title = 'Simpsons' Springfield to legalize gay marriage| date = February 20, 2005 | url = http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1108839529477_49?hub=World| accessdate = August 8, 2011|publisher = [[CTV Television Network]] }}</ref> Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in ''The Gospel According to The Simpsons'' that once the episode ended, it was hard to tell what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various ''Simpsons'' characters".<ref name="Pinsky"/> Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say ''The Simpsons'' has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book ''[[The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History]]'', John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic."<ref>{{cite book|last=Ortved|first=John|title=The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History |year=2009|publisher=Greystone Books|isbn=978-1-55365-503-9|page=269}}</ref>

"There's Something About Marrying" was met with positive reception as well, particularly from gay rights groups.<ref name=Hutchinson>{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Bill|title=I Doh!

He commented that "when Marge learns that Patty's about to marry someone who isn't really a lesbian, she comes to realize that what her sister really deserves is to be in love with and married to a person who's right for her.

Irksome lesbian stereotypes abound, and Nelson the bully suggests they 'legalize gay funerals.' And naturally, Reverend Lovejoy shutters his church to the same-sex sinners."<ref name=ellen/> According to ''Simpsons'' writer [[Mike Reiss]], the episode also had supporters among conservative groups. He told ''Encore'' magazine that "gay people came out very much in favor of it and were happy with the episode, but arch conservatives and right-wing Christians loved the episode, too, because they seemed to think we were making fun of gay people. We really had it both ways."<ref name="Pinsky"/>

Kennerley further wrote that "based on this episode, [...] ''The Simpsons'' is in top form. It still reigns as the funniest, brashest, fastest-paced half-hour you<U+2019>ll see on television."<ref name=ellen/> Bill Gibron of [[PopMatters]] also thought the episode was funny, commenting that it "explored the often-cited 'slippery slope' of allowing matrimony to be defined outside the parameters of a man and a woman<U+2014>with hilarious results."<ref name=Gibron>{{cite web|last=Gibron|first=Bill|title=The Simpsons - Still the One|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/simpsons-2005|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=June 19, 2011|date=May 26, 2005}}</ref> In regards to the revelation that Patty was gay, ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote that it "wasn't particularly earth-shattering" but that Marge's initial reaction provided a good twist to the episode.<ref name=AVclubInventory/> J. Stewart Burns received a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nomination in the animation category for his work on "There's Something About Marrying", although he lost the award to another ''Simpsons'' writer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=1493|title=2006 Writers Guild Awards Television and Radio Nominees Announced |accessdate=August 8, 2011|publisher=Writers Guild of America}}</ref>
