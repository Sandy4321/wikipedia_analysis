The '''1816 artillery short sword''' was a sidearm issued to the French foot artillery. Heavily influenced by the prevailing [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical style]] of the day, the sword was based on ancient sculptural depictions of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ''[[gladius]]'', the standard sword of the Roman [[legionary|legionaries]]. The short sword would not have been a practical weapon for combat without a shield, but served as a [[fascine knife]] or a [[machete]] to clear fields for the guns. It also served for other practical uses, the French soldiers calling it a ''coupe-chou'' ("cabbage cutter"). It was in service until about 1870.<ref>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=C.A.|title=French Model 1831 Foot Artillery Sword|url=http://arms2armor.com/Swords/fren1831.htm|work=Arms to Armor|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>

The model was reissued in 1831 with minor changes. Most visibly, the newer model had a ringed grip rather than the fishscale pattern seen in the earlier model.<ref>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=C.A.|title=French Model 1816 Foot Artillery Sword|url=http://arms2armor.com/Swords/fren1816ass.htm|work=Arms to Armor|accessdate=14 June 2012}}</ref>  It also provided the inspiration for the [[Model 1832 Foot Artillery Sword|American 1832 832 Foot Artillery Sword]].
