'''Ian David Hislop''' (born 13 July 1960) is a British [[satirist]], [[comedian]], writer, [[presenter|broadcaster]] and [[editor in chief|editor]] of the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. He has appeared on many radio and television programmes, most notably as a team captain on the [[BBC]] [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] satirical [[quiz]] ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.

==Early life==
Hislop was born on 13 July 1960<ref>{{cite book|title=Debrett's People of Today 2005|edition=18th|isbn=1870520106|publisher=[[Debrett's]]|page=769}}</ref> in [[Mumbles]], [[Swansea]] in Wales, to a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] father, David, and a [[Channel Island]]er mother, Helen Rosemarie Beddows, of English descent.<ref name="wdytya IH"/> When he was five months old, his family began to travel around the world because of his father's job as a civil engineer.<ref name="wdytya IH"/> During his infant years Hislop lived in [[Nigeria]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. On his return to Britain he was educated at [[Ardingly College]], an independent boarding school, where he began his satirical career directing and appearing in [[revues]] alongside [[Nick Newman]], and became Head Boy. Hislop and Newman's association continued when they went to [[Oxford University|Oxford]], and they later worked together at ''[[Private Eye]]'' and on a number of comedy scriptwriting jobs. Hislop applied to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at Oxford, but changed to English Literature before going up. He graduated from [[Magdalen College, Oxford]] with a degree in [[English literature]] in 1981.

===Family===
When Hislop was 12 years old his father, David Hislop, died; his mother also died when he was quite young.{{when|date=April 2011}}<ref name="wdytya IH"/> She was born in Jersey and left in her late teens.<ref name="wdytya IH"/> Hislop did not know his grandparents.<ref name="wdytya IH"/>

Hislop's paternal grandfather, David Murdoch Hislop, died just before Hislop was born.<ref name="wdytya IH"/>  He was Scottish and became a [[deacon]] at a [[Presbyterian]] church and a school headteacher at Newton Academy in [[Ayr]]. In the [[First World War]] he fought in Northern France with the 9th [[Highland Light Infantry]].<ref name="wdytya IH"/>

Hislop's maternal grandfather, William Beddows, was originally from [[Lancashire]].<ref name="wdytya IH"/> He joined the army in 1895 and fought in the [[Second Boer War]] with the [[Royal Lancashire Regiment]] in major campaigns including the [[Battle of Spion Kop]].<ref name="wdytya IH"/> He moved to [[Jersey]] to serve as a sergeant, having signed up in 1906 for another ten years in the army.<ref name="wdytya IH">{{cite episode |title=Who Do You Think You Are? with Ian Hislop |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/get_started/wdytya_s1_celeb_gallery_05.shtml

==Career==
===''Private Eye''===
At [[Oxford University|Oxford]] he founded and edited the magazine ''Passing Wind'', for which he interviewed [[Richard Ingrams]], who was then editor of ''[[Private Eye]]''. Hislop joined the publication immediately after leaving Oxford, and became editor in 1986 upon Ingrams' departure. It was revealed in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' that this was despite opposition from ''Eye'' hacks Peter McKay and [[Nigel Dempster]], with the former taking the magazine's majority shareholder, [[Peter Cook]], out for lunch in an attempt to dissuade him from appointing Hislop. Cook pressed on however, and his new editor sacked both McKay and Dempster from the magazine without hesitation.

As editor of ''Private Eye'' Ian Hislop is the most sued man in English legal history,<ref>

After the case he quipped: "I've just given a fat cheque to a fat Czech." However the magazine's attacks on Maxwell were fully vindicated by the revelations of massive fraud that followed his death. On another occasion, when ordered to pay <U+00A3>600,000 in damages after being sued for libel by Sonia Sutcliffe, wife of the [[Yorkshire Ripper]], [[Peter Sutcliffe]], Hislop told reporters waiting outside the High Court: "If that's justice, then I'm a banana." The award was, however, dropped to <U+00A3>60,000 on appeal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/24/newsid_2503000/2503595.stm |title=On this day - 24 May 1989: Yorkshire Ripper's wife wins damages |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=28 November 2010 }}</ref> In his many court cases, Hislop has only won twice.<ref name="metro" />

Hislop continues to be applauded for his wit and satire. In an interview with ''[[Third Way Magazine]]'' he said: "Satire is the bringing to ridicule of vice, folly and humbug. All the negatives imply a set of positives. Certainly in this country, you only go round saying, <U+2018>That<U+2019>s wrong, that<U+2019>s corrupt<U+2019> if you have some feeling that it should be better than that. People say, <U+2018>You satirists attack everything.<U+2019> Well, we don<U+2019>t, actually. That<U+2019>s the whole point."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin Wroe |year=1995 |month=March |title=Is Nothing Sacred? |journal=[[Third Way Magazine|Third Way]] |issn=0309-3492 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=12<U+2013>15 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Cg5gAS_YdyEC&pg=PA12 |accessdate=28 November 2010 }}</ref>

===''Have I Got News for You''===
Hislop is the only person to have appeared in every episode of ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> in its twenty year history, even filming an episode in the seventh series in spite of suffering from [[appendicitis]] (he had discharged himself from hospital immediately before the show).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7783644.stm |title=Five minutes with Ian Hislop |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>  His satirical views and broad knowledge of politics complement the wry surrealism of fellow panellist [[Paul Merton]]. With the exception of one episode, in which Hislop and Merton swapped places and dress styles for comic effect, he has only ever sat in the near left seat from the audience's point of view.

===Other television and radio work===
Hislop's television debut was on the short-lived [[Channel 4]] [[chat show]] ''[[Loose Talk]]'' in 1983, an experience he disliked so much that he included it on his list of most hated items when he first appeared on the BBC show ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]''. Hislop was also a [[screenwriter]] on the 1980s political satire series ''[[Spitting Image]]'', in which puppets were used to depict well-known figures, mostly politicians. He even had a puppet of himself, which sometimes appeared as a background character in sketches.

Along with [[Nick Newman]] Hislop wrote the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''Gush'', a satire based on the first [[Gulf War]], in the style of [[Jeffrey Archer]]. With Newman he also wrote the family-friendly satirical sitcom ''[[My Dad's the Prime Minister]]'' and in the early nineties for the [[Dawn French]] vehicle ''[[Murder Most Horrid]]''. Hislop and Newman wrote the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] series ''[[The News At Bedtime]]'', aired over the 2009 Christmas season. The series starred [[Jack Dee]] as 'John Tweedledum' and [[Peter Capaldi]] as 'Jim Tweedledee'; the two present the "news of the day" in the world of fairy tales, while arguing with each other as did their [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee|namesakes]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy.org.uk/guide/radio/the_news_at_bedtime/ |title=The News At Bedtime |publisher=British Comedy Guide}}</ref>

Hislop has also presented serious television programmes. These include ''School Rules'', a three-part Channel 4 study on the history of British education; an edition of the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', in which he attempted to trace his genealogy and ''[[Not Forgotten (TV)|Not Forgotten]]'', a four-part series on Channel 4 detailing the impact on British society of the [[First World War]]. A further programme, ''Not Forgotten: Shot at Dawn'', was broadcast in January 2007, and a sixth episode, ''Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight'', featuring the stories of conscientious objectors such as [[Ronald Skirth]],<ref name=rel>{{citation

He also presented one episode of the BBC's ''[[Great Railway Journeys]]'', in which he travelled in India ["India East to West" from Calcutta to Rajasthan]. In May 2007 he presented a programme on BBC Four, ''Ian Hislop's Scouting for Boys'', celebrating [[Robert Baden-Powell]]'s book which inspired the [[Scouting|Scout]] movement. Another BBC Four programme, ''Ian Hislop Goes Off the Rails'', about the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching Report]] and its impact on the British railway network, was first aired on 2 October 2008, and achieved the second highest audience to date for any BBC Four programme (and the highest for a documentary) with 1.3 million viewers.<ref>{{cite news|author=Leigh Holmwood |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/03/tvratings.television |title=Overnight ratings for 2 October 2008 from '&#39;The Guardian'&#39;, 3 October 2008 |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-10-03|accessdate=2010-04-28 | location=London}}</ref>

He has also written and presented factual programmes for Radio 4 about such subjects as tax rebellions, female hymn composers, scouting and patron saints of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/religion/patronsaints_patrick.shtml |title=Radio 4 programme on patron saints of Britain and Ireland |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> In 2007 he became the only person to make a second guest appearance on ''Room 101''. He has also been a comedy screenwriter for [[Harry Enfield]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/you-ask-the-questions-such-as-ian-hislop-you-look-like-a-gnome-why-do-people-find-you-sexy-717546.html |title=You ask the questions (Such as: Ian Hislop, you look like a gnome.

Hislop has presented several programmes for [[BBC Four|BBC 4]], dealing with topics such as [[The Scout Association|Boy Scouts]], the [[Beeching Axe]] and the role of the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. The latter, ''Ian Hislop's Changing of the Bard'', launched the May 2009 BBC 4 Poetry season, and Hislop recounted the history of the post from the first - official - holder, [[John Dryden]], to the then recently announced first female, first Scot and first openly bisexual laureate, [[Carol Ann Duffy]]. His series on Victorian social reformers, ''Ian Hislop's Age of the Do-Gooders'', aired on [[BBC Two]] beginning on 29 November 2010.

He also enjoys a career as an after dinner speaker and awards presenter, working for several speaker bureaux.

Ian Hislop is an Ambassador for [[The Scout Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scouts.org.uk/news/334/young-filmmakers-launch-new-scouting-movie-to-thank-supporters |title=Young film-makers launch new Scouting movie to thank supporters}}</ref>

===Religious views===
In Caroline Chartres' book ''Why I Am Still an Anglican'' Hislop opens his chapter by saying "I've tried atheism and I can't stick at it: I keep having doubts. That probably sums up my position."<ref>Chartres, Caroline (2006). ''Why I Am Still an Anglican: Essays and Conversations.'' Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 99. ISBN 978-0826481436</ref> In 1996 he presented an award-winning documentary series for Channel 4 about the history of the [[Church of England]], called ''Canterbury Tales''. Recent works include the Radio 4 series ''The Real Patron Saints''.

On 4 September 2009 Hislop appeared at [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]]'s "The Gathering" at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] to discuss religion, society and journalism among other issues before a crowd of about 1,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=4958 |title=Archbishop to debate with Private Eye editor |publisher=Religious Intelligence |date=2009-09-02 |last=Creswell |first=Matt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=81265 |title=Door is closing on Church's foot, says Williams |publisher=Church Times |date=2009-09-11 |last=Beavan |first=Ed}}</ref>

===Political views===
Hislop has been highly critical of all major British political parties for over 20 years. Appearing on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]'' on 18 September 2008 he praised [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]] treasury spokesman [[Vince Cable]] for his analysis of the ongoing economic and financial crisis, apparently expressing support for the Liberal Democrats, jocularly stating "I'm standing for them."<ref>{{cite episode |title= Question Time|network= [[BBC]]|airdate= 2008-09-18}}</ref> In a 2009 "Five minutes with" interview with [[Matthew Stadlen]] for [[BBC News]] he stated that if he were required, "at the point of a gun", to stand in an election for any British political party, he would stand for the fictional "Vince Cable for [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Treasurer]] Party".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7783644.stm |title=Five minutes With Ian Hislop |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref> After the formation of the coalition government in 2010, Hislop remarked on HIGNFY, "I like the idea of this coalition neutralizing the loonies on both sides".
