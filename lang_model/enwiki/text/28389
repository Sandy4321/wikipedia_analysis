'''Barton Road Swing Bridge''' is a [[swing bridge]] for road traffic in [[Greater Manchester]] that crosses the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] between [[Trafford Park]] in the [[Trafford|Metropolitan Borough of Trafford]] to [[Barton-upon-Irwell]] in the the [[City of Salford]]. The bridge is a Grade II [[listed building]]<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.salford.gov.uk/conbarton.htm | title = Barton-upon-Irwell | publisher = [[City of Salford]] | accessdate = 20 January 2010}}</ref> and is part of a wider conservation area that surrounds the bridge. It runs parallel to the [[Barton Swing Aqueduct]] which carries the [[Bridgewater Canal]]. The bridge opens regularly for traffic along the Manchester Ship Canal, and consequently can cause delays.

The bridge and aqueduct were built together along with the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, though other bridges had existed for over 200 years at that point. During the 20th century, it became increasingly important as a connection to Trafford Park and for traffic to bypass Manchester and Salford city centres, and consequently became a significant traffic bottleneck. A replacement high level bridge was built further downstream, and today the bridge carries local traffic.

==Operation==
[[File:Barton Swing Aqueduct 11.05.02R.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial photo of the bridge (right) and aqueduct (left)]] The structure is located adjacent to, and downstream of, the [[Barton Swing Aqueduct]]. The two crossings are controlled from a brick-built valve house, on a {{convert|122|m|ft}} x {{convert|9|m|ft}} man-made island in the centre of the canal.<ref name="et"/> The tower is four stories high, each with a 2x2 bay and accessed via an external staircase.<ref name="scc"/>{{rp|22}}

The bridge opens to let shipping traffic through the Manchester Ship Canal, which can occur up to 14 times a day. The island supports the pivot points for the rotating structures, which are fixed with concrete.<ref name="et"/> When in the open positions, the aqueduct and road bridge line up along the length of the island, allowing ships to traverse along each side of the ship canal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryall|first=M.

==History==
===Early crossings===
[[File:Barton road swing bridge.jpg|thumb|The road crossing]]
There has been a crossing at this location since at least the 17th century, where the road crossed the [[River Irwell]]. A bridge was constructed over the river around 1677<U+2013>79, replacing an earlier ford.<ref>{{cite book|title=English Counties and Public Building, 1650<U+2013>1830|first=Christopher|last=Chalklin|publisher=A&C Black|year=1998|p=111|isbn=978-1-852-85153-8}}</ref> It was the first river crossing east of [[Warrington]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=la0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA347&dq=barton+upon+irwell+bridge&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rBvWU76OG4yX0QXO54H4AQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&q=%22barton%20upon%20irwell%22&f=false|title=The English Counties Delineated|volume=2|first=Thomas|last=Moule|year=1837|p=362}}</ref> This bridge was demolished in 1745 in order to stop progress by the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite army]] and was replaced by a wooden footbridge, and subsequently a three arch road bridge.<ref name="scc">{{cite report|url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/d/barton-conservationarea.pdf|title=Barton Conservation Area|publisher=Salford City Council|year=2007|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>{{rp|13}} These bridges pre-dated the [[Barton Aqueduct]], and a condition of the aqueduct's design was that it did not impede progress on the Irwell any more than the existing bridge.<ref>{{cite book|title=Barton's Bridges|last=Atkinson|first=Glen|publisher=Neil Richardson |year=2002|pp=14<U+2013>15|isbn=978-1-85216-146-0}}</ref>

===Current bridge===
The current bridge was built during the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal. It was designed by the project's engineer, [[Edward Leader Williams]], and constructed by [[Andrew Handyside and Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportheritage.com/find-heritage-locations.html?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&catid=61&sobi2Id=212|title=Barton Swing Aqueduct|publisher=Transport Heritage|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="scc"/>{{rp|16}} Williams' design was chosen as the best of three possible plans by [[James Abernethy]], who subsequently became the scheme's consulting engineer.<ref name="et"/> The bridge opened to traffic on 1 January 1894.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SsMlAQAAIAAJ&q=%22barton+road+swing+bridge%22+opening+1894&dq=%22barton+road+swing+bridge%22+opening+1894&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mS3VU9_rCanD7Ab37IH4Aw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ|title=Transactions of the Institution of Mining Engineers|volume=46|publisher=Institution of Mining Engineers (Great Britain)|year=1914|p=652}}</ref> The total span is {{convert|59.3|m|ft}} and it carries a {{convert|5.6|m|ft}} roadway.<ref name="et"/>

By the 1930s, the bridge had become a significant bottleneck for workers in [[Trafford Park]], who commuted over the bridge on foot or cycle, particularly during peak hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/10/road-bridges-manchester-ship-canal#S5CV0347P0_19390510_HOC_257|title=Road bridges, Manchester Ship Canal|work=Hansard|date=10 May 1939|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> It also became an important route for goods vehicles, both heading to Trafford Park and crossing Lancashire,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1960/jul/26/manchester-ship-canal-bill-lords#S5CV0627P0_19600726_HOC_425|title=Manchester Ship Canal Bill|first=John|last=Hay|work=Hansard|date=26 July 1960|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> and parishioners in [[Eccles]] travelling to mass at the All Saints Church on the canal's south side.<ref>{{cite book|title=Trafford Park: The First Hundred Years|first=Robert|last=Nicholls|publisher=Phillimore|year=1996|p=156}}</ref>

In 1946, concern was expressed in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|parliament]] over the closing of the bridge to road traffic at peak times.<ref>{{citenews | url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1946/dec/02/barton-swing-bridge | title = Barton Swing Bridge | publisher = [[Hansard]] | date = 2 December 1946 | accessdate = 20 January 2010}}</ref> The following year, an arrangement was agreed with the Manchester Ship Canal Company that the bridge would generally stay open for road traffic during this time, though this could not be guaranteed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1950/nov/27/traffic-congestion-barton-bridge#S5CV0481P0_19501127_HOC_148|title=Traffic Congestion, Barton Bridge|first=Alfred|last=Barnes|work=Hansard|date=27 November 1950|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> A cargo vessel struck the bridge on 28 December 1948, restricting the bridge to single-line working and a two ton weight limit, until repairs had been completed.<ref>{{citenews | url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=IjM1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=I6YLAAAAIBAJ&pg=2530,7099709&dq=barton+road+swing+bridge+cargo+ship&hl=en | title = Damaged Bridge Open | publisher = [[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]] | date = 30 December 1948 | accessdate = 20 January 2010}}</ref> In 1953, traffic was banned from turning right off the bridge into Barton Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1953/jul/31/barton-bridge-stretford-traffic-order#S5CV0518P0_19530731_CWA_77|title=Barton Bridge, Stretford (Traffic Order)|first=Alan|last=Lennox-Boyd|work=Hansard|date=31 July 1953|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>

By the 1950s, the bridge had become part of a ''de facto'' outer ring road as it formed part of a main road, the A575, from [[Stretford]] to [[Bolton]], avoiding both Manchester and [[Salford]].<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/maps/index.php?view=53.47380,-2.35856&map=NPEMap&zoom=14&layer=1&markers=53.47449,-2.35367,|title=Sheet 101 (Manchester)|publisher=Ordnance Survey|series=Seventh Series|scale=1 inch / mile|year=1958|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1954/feb/03/barton-bridge#S5CV0523P0_19540203_HOC_59|title=Barton Bridge|work=Hansard|date=3 February 1954|accessdate=28 July 2014|quote="if he [the Minister of Transport] will take the necessary steps to stop the diversion of traffic from the Manchester outer ring road over the Barton Bridge"}}</ref> A traffic survey in 1954 revealed 9,600 vehicles were using the bridge daily against 7,000 closures a year. A replacement bridge was considered vitally important to the local economy, particularly that of Trafford Park. [[William Proctor (British politician)|William Proctor]], MP for Eccles, said "I cannot think of any other project in the North of England which should have higher priority than the Barton Bridge scheme."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1954/may/28/road-development-and-improvement#S5CV0528P0_19540528_HOC_54|title=Road Development and Improvement|work=Hansard|date=28 May 1954|accessdate=28 July 2014|first=William|last=Proctor}}</ref> Construction of the replacement Barton High Level Bridge started in 1957, opening to traffic in October 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m63stretecc.htm|title= M63 (Now M60) Stretford Eccles By-pass and Carrington Spur (J13 to J7)|publisher=Chartered Institute of Highway Engineers|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> Traffic on the swing bridge has also been reduced by the Centenary Bridge eastbound towards Salford.<ref name="scc"/>{{rp|33}}

==Conservation area==
In 1976, the area around the bridge was designated a conservation area, with responsibility shared between Salford City and Trafford. The bridge and the aqueduct both became Grade II listed structures.<ref name="scc"/>{{rp|6,21}} Salford City Council have been concerned about the poor quality of pedestrian access across the bridge, which, as well as being potentially unsafe, detracts from the possibility of tourism in the area.<ref name="scc"/>{{rp|19}} The ultimate aim for the council is to refurbish the area around the bridge and aqueduct so it meets the status of a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="scc"/>{{rp|38}}

The council are also concerned about the amount of wear and tear the bridge sustains, as although no longer on a major road, it still carries significant traffic.<ref name="scc"/>{{rp|34}} In August 2008, the bridge was temporarily closed to enable the replacement of electricity cabling,<ref>{{citenews | url = http://www.salfordonline.com/localnews_page/7903-_drivers_to_expect_delays_during_roadworks_-_salford_city_council.html | title = Drivers to Expect Delays During Roadworks  | publisher = Salford City Council | date = August 2008 | accessdate = 28 January 2014}}</ref> while in April, 2013, Salford City Council announced the bridge could be closed for up to six weeks to install pipes to prevent sewer flooding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/pr-13-3505.htm|title=Drivers warned to avoid Barton|publisher=Salford City Council|date=19 April 2013|accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>
