'''Ben Camey Wallace''' (born September 10, 1974) is an [[United States|American]] [[basketball]] player. He currently plays in the [[National Basketball Association]] with the [[Detroit Pistons]]. [[Nickname]]d "Big Ben",<ref>{{cite news

|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> he plays the [[center (basketball)|center]] and [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] positions, and is listed at {{height|ft=6|in=9}} and {{convert|240|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. He has won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] four times, a record he shares with [[Dikembe Mutombo]]. Wallace was a member of the [[Detroit Pistons]] team that won the [[2004 NBA Finals|NBA championship in 2004]].

==Early life==
Ben Wallace was born  in {{city-state|White Hall|Alabama}}, a small town in [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], and is the tenth of eleven children. He later attended Central High School in [[Hayneville, Alabama|Hayneville]] where he received all-state honors in basketball, [[baseball]], and [[American football]] (as a [[linebacker]]). Former basketball player [[Charles Oakley]] is Wallace's mentor, having discovered Wallace at a 1991 basketball camp, and later recommended Wallace to his previous college, [[Virginia Union]].

==College career==
Wallace first played [[college basketball]] on the [[junior college]] level at [[Cuyahoga Community College]] in [[Cleveland]] for two years. There, staples of Wallace's defensive prowess were shown as he averaged 17.0 rebounds and 6.9 blocks per game.
He then transferred to [[Virginia Union University|Virginia Union]], a [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] school, where he studied [[criminal justice]]. Wallace averaged 13.4 points per game and 10.0 rebounds per game as a member of the Virginia Union Panthers, whom he led to the Division II Final Four and a 28<U+2013>3 record.<ref>[http://www.bballone.com/benw/benwallacebio.html Ben Wallace Bio | Official Site of BBallOne.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As a senior, Wallace was named to the First-Team All CIAA and was selected as a First Team All-American (Div. II) by the NABC. Wallace was a letterman in football, baseball, basketball and track. He won All-State honors in all but track.

==NBA career==
===Early career===
As an [[NBA Draft|undrafted]] player, he was signed as a rookie [[free agent]] by the [[Washington Bullets]] on October 2, 1996 after playing in [[Italy]]. In 1999, Wallace was traded to the [[Orlando Magic]] along with [[Tim Legler]], [[Terry Davis (basketball)|Terry Davis]], and [[Jeff McInnis]] for [[Isaac Austin|Ike Austin]]. 

===Detroit Pistons===
On August 3, 2000, he was traded along with [[Chucky Atkins]] to the [[Detroit Pistons]] for [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]], in what was at the time considered{{Who|date=March 2009}} a one-sided trade; Hill had planned to sign with Orlando as an unrestricted free agent, but the sign and trade deal allowed Hill to receive a slightly more lucrative contract while Detroit received at least some compensation for losing its marquee player. Since the trade, he has won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]] in [[2001<U+2013>02 NBA season|2001<U+2013>02]], [[2002-03 NBA season|2002<U+2013>03]], [[2004-05 NBA season|2004<U+2013>05]], and [[2005-06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06 seasons]], and was selected to six [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive teams]]. In the 2001<U+2013>02 and 2002<U+2013>03 seasons, he led the league in both [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]], the first to do so since [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. In 2003, he was voted by fans to the first of his four [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances as a center for the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]].

Near the end of a November 2004 game against the [[Indiana Pacers]], Wallace responded to a foul by Indiana's [[Ron Artest]] by shoving Artest, which eventually led to the [[Pacers<U+2013>Pistons brawl]], involving both players and spectators. Wallace was suspended for six games, and his brother David Wallace, received a year of probation and community service for punching Indiana players in the stands.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10089645/|title=Palace brawl lives in infamy 1 year later|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 26, 2005}}</ref>
[[File:BenWallaceCloseup.jpg|thumb|150px|Wallace during his tenure with the Bulls]]
The Pistons began a tradition of sounding a deep chime whenever "Big Ben" scored or recorded a block on Detroit's home court, the [[Palace of Auburn Hills]] <U+2013> an allusion to the original [[Big Ben]] in London. (The Bulls and Cavaliers continued the gimmick during his respective tenures with Chicago and Cleveland).

===Chicago Bulls===
On July 3, 2006, Wallace agreed to a four-year, $60 million deal with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. During his two-year run in Chicago, Wallace battled with various knee injuries and averaged 5.7 points, 9.7 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 2.0 blocks per game.

===Cleveland Cavaliers===

On February 21, 2008, he was traded to the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] as part of a three-team deal that included the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/nba_experts/post/Bulls-trade-Wallace-Smith-for-trio?urn=nba,67973 |title=Cavs land James some help
|work= NBA Experts Blog 
|publisher= Yahoo! Sports |accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> The deal moved Wallace to the [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] position with [[Zydrunas Ilgauskas]] as the starting center. Following the trade, Wallace played in 22 regular season games (all starts).  In 26.3 minutes, he averaged 4.2 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game.  In 72 total regular season games Wallace averaged 4.8 points, 8.4 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game.<ref name=b-ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallabe01.html Ben Wallace Statistics <U+2013> Basketball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Wallace had a Cavalier regular season high of 12 points on February 24, 2008 against the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], and had regular season Cavalier highs of 15 rebounds against the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] and four blocks against the [[Orlando Magic]].<ref name=0708logs>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallabe01.html <U+2013> Ben Wallace 2007<U+2013>2008 Game Logs]</ref> In the 2008 playoffs, Wallace played in 13 games (all starts) and averaged 3.2 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game.<ref name=b-ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallabe01.html Ben Wallace Statistics <U+2013> Basketball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He had his playoff high of 12 rebounds in Game 4 win against the [[Washington Wizards]] in the first round of the NBA playoffs.<ref name="0708logs"/> On November 25, 2008, Wallace grabbed his 9,000th career rebound and blocked his 1,900th career shot.

===Phoenix Suns===
On June 25, 2009, Wallace was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] with [[Sasha Pavlovi<U+0107>]], a second round draft pick and $500k for [[Shaquille O'Neal]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/suns/news/shaq_traded_090625.html |title=Suns Complete Trade With Cavs, Send Shaq to Cleveland |date=2009-06-25 |work=[[NBA.com]] |accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> 

On July 13, 2009, the Suns bought out Wallace's $14 million contract, saving $8 million in the process. Wallace actually received $10 million but Phoenix was in luxury tax so the savings were effectively doubled.

===Return to Pistons===
On August 7, 2009, Wallace agreed to re-sign with the Pistons as a free agent.

==Player profile==
Ben Wallace plays the center position and has been lauded as a prime defensive presence in his career.<ref name=wire>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nba&id=2437567 ESPN - Detroit's Ben Wallace wins NBA's top defensive award - NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has been voted as the NBA Defensive Player of the Year four times. He is somewhat undersized for a center, being listed at {{height|ft=6|in=9}}, 240&nbsp;lb., a frame statistically resembling more of a forward; he himself admits his actual height is {{height|ft=6|in=7}}.<ref name=wire/> His scoring is typically well below average for an NBA starter. Perhaps most problematic area is his free throw shooting. Much like fellow center [[Shaquille O'Neal]] his free throw shooting is typically in the low to mid 40% range. This has often led teams to foul him much like the [[Hack-A-Shaq]] defense.<ref>http://mistakesports.blogspot.com/2009/01/to-hack-or-not-to-hack-ben.html</ref> His career free throw percentage is just 41.8% and has never had a season with more than 49% made.<ref>http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallabe01.html</ref> Wallace has, at times had good offensive games with points in the 20s although this has been rare. He has also on 5 separate occasions hit a 3 point shot, though these are usually desperation attempts before the clock expires. His 3pt percentage is just 5/43 for 11.6%. For his career Wallace has averaged 6.2 points per game, with some seasons being in the high 9's.

==Personal life==
Wallace is married to Chanda and is the father of two sons, Ben Jr. and Bryce, and one daughter, Baile, and currently lives in [[Moreland Hills]], [[Ohio]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/ben_wallace/bio.html NBA.com : Ben Wallace Bio Page<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Wallace appeared on the cover of ''[[NBA2K|ESPN NBA 2K5]]''. An inflatable basketball training aid of Wallace's likeness, called the Inflatable Defender, is manufactured by PlayAir Systems. His new sneaker, the ''Big Ben'' was released November 5, 2007 under [[Stephon Marbury]]'s [[Starbury]] label and sold for $14.98 at [[Steve & Barry's]] stores.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1680154,00.html | work=Time | title=Sneaker Cents | date=November 2, 2007 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> Wallace gained great notoriety in the [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] area and nationwide as fans often arrived at his games sporting wigs in honor of his trademark [[afro]] hairstyle. However, he usually only had the afro for home games; for away games, he had his hair styled into [[cornrows]]. He said he was heckled at away games for his hairstyles.
