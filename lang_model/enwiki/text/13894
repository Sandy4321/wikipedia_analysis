'''Antoine Balland''' (27 August 1751 <U+2013> 3 November 1821) commanded a French infantry division during the early years of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. A former private, he was promoted to command an infantry regiment after the [[Battle of Jemappes]]. He became a [[general of brigade]] in late August 1793 and a [[general of division]] less than three weeks later. Soon afterwards, he led a division in [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]'s victory at [[Battle of Wattignies|Wattignies]]. In the spring of 1794, he led his troops at [[Battle of Le Cateau (1794)|Le Cateau]], [[Battle of Beaumont (1794)|Beaumont]] and [[Siege of Landrecies (1794)|Landrecies]]. By this time it was obvious that he did not have the talent to command a combat division and he was replaced by [[Jean Baptiste Kl<U+00E9>ber]]. He was not employed after June 1795 and died at [[Guise]] in 1821.

==Early career==
Balland was born at [[Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin, Is<U+00E8>re|Pont-de-Beauvoisin]] on 27 August 1751. He enlisted in the ''Beauvoisis'' Regiment on 17 April 1769, which later became the [[57th Line Infantry Regiment]]. He was promoted [[corporal]] on 17 February 1771,  [[sergeant]] on 24 February 1773, [[sergeant major]] on 11 August 1781 and [[adjutant]] on 4 September 1784. He was discharged from the ''Beauvoisis'' Regiment on 1 November 1790.{{sfn|Dupuis|1909|p=92}}

===Jemappes and Wattignies===

Balland joined the 1st [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] Battalion of ''[[Paris]]'' as a [[captain (armed forces)|captain]] on 21 July 1791. He became the second [[lieutenant colonel]] on 16 January 1792 and first lieutenant colonel on 27 August 1792.{{sfn|Dupuis|1909|p=92}} At the [[Battle of Jemappes]] on 6 November 1792, the Right Wing Advance Guard under [[Auguste Marie Henri Picot de Dampierre]] included the 1st ''Paris'' Battalion.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=30}} Balland fought at Jemappes and earned promotion to [[colonel]] of the 83rd Infantry Regiment on 8 March 1793.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=249}}{{sfn|Dupuis|1909|p=92}} He assumed the rank of [[general of brigade]] on 27 August 1793 and [[general of division]] seventeen days later on 13 September 1793.{{sfn|Broughton|2001}}        

The writer [[Paul Thi<U+00E9>bault]] was enraged that Balland, a man "without form and without foundation", was named to command a division. Balland took [[<U+00C9>douard Mortier]] on his staff.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=249}} After the Coalition army began the [[Siege of Maubeuge (1793)|Siege of Maubeuge]], ''[[Army of the North (France)|Army of the North]]'' commander [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] began shifting his main army from the Camp of [[Gavrelle]] south-east to [[Guise]]. He sent the first division under [[Jacques Pierre Fromentin]] on 3 October and the second division under Balland at dawn on 6 October. Balland's 13,424-man division reached [[Bapaume]] that evening, [[P<U+00E9>ronne, Somme|P<U+00E9>ronne]] on 7 October, [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] on 8 October and Guise the next day.{{sfn|Dupuis|1909|pp=91<U+2013>92}} Jourdan massed a total of 44,276 soldiers at Guise.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=250}}

Jourdan attacked the Coalition army of [[Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] in the [[Battle of Wattignies]] from 15<U+2013>16 October 1793.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=59}} Balland's division consisted of 11,884 infantry in eight battalions of regulars and 13 of volunteers (21 battalions), ranging in strength from 218 to 895 men. The 1,410 mounted troops included the 16th and 17th Heavy Cavalry and the 4th [[Hussar]] and 6th [[Chasseurs <U+00E0> Cheval]] Regiments.{{sfn|Dupuis|1909|pp=100<U+2013>101}} On the first day, the French planned to have the left and right wings attack first. After progress was made on the flanks, Balland's division in the center would attack.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=252}}

Initially Fromentin's soldiers on the left flank and [[Florent Joseph Duquesnoy]]'s troops on the right gained ground. Though Jourdan believed it was not yet time, the powerful politician [[Lazare Carnot]] of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] insisted that Balland's men immediately assault the village of [[Dourlers]]. The attack was launched and was beaten back with losses of about 1,500 men. At the same time Fromentin was repulsed and Duquesnoy was stopped at Wattignies, with a loss of 12 guns.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=253}} During the night, Jourdan took 6,000 troops from Balland to help Duquesnoy's men capture [[Wattignies-la-Victoire|Wattignies]] and Coburg assembled 16,400 foot and 6,000 horse to oppose the French.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=254}} On 16 October, the French moved into position in a fog but their first two attacks were defeated; the third assault succeeded and the battle was won.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=255}}

===Le Cateau and Landrecies===
The new ''Army of the North'' commander [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]], ordered an attack on [[Le Cateau-Cambr<U+00E9>sis]] on 29 March 1794. The divisions of Balland and [[Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet]] advanced from Guise, while Fromentin moved from [[Avesnes-sur-Helpe]]. In the [[Battle of Le Cateau (1794)|Battle of Le Cateau]], the French were beaten with the loss of 1,200 casualties and four guns, while the Austrians only lost 293 men. On 17 and 18 April, Coburg's army drove back Balland, Goguet and Fromentin to open the [[Siege of Landrecies (1794)|Siege of Landrecies]].{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=285}} In the operation, the 60,000-man Coalition army sustained 1,000 casualties including 627 Austrians, while the French lost over 2,000 killed, wounded and missing as well as 24 field guns.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=73}} Since Pichegru was far away at [[Lille]], Balland as the senior general on the spot ordered a counter-stroke.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=285}} The attack on 21 April was repulsed with the loss of 500 killed and four guns. One of the dead was Goguet, killed by his own men.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=286}}

On 26 April, the French divisions launched simultaneous attacks on the Coalition positions in the [[Battle of Beaumont (1794)|Battle of Beaumont]]. Coalition cavalry rode down the division of [[Ren<U+00E9>-Bernard Chapuy]], capturing thousands of French soldiers and their commanding general. Balland's division was routed in a separate action on 26 April.{{sfn|Phipps|2011|p=287}} Goguet was replaced by [[Paul-Alexis Dubois]] and Chapuis by [[Jacques Philippe Bonnaud]] and Landrecies fell to the Coalition on 30 April. By this time there were protests that Balland's troops fought poorly and that he did not support his fellow commanders. Fromentin wrote that, "everyone complains about him". On 11 May, Balland was removed from command of his division and replaced by [[Jean Baptiste Kl<U+00E9>ber]].{{sfn|Phipps|2011|pp=290<U+2013>291}}

==Later career==
Balland was not in the list of active generals on 13 June 1795 and was discharged on 13 March 1798.{{sfn|Dupuis|1909|p=92}} He was awarded the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur]] in 1805.<ref>{{cite web|title=L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur: Balland (Antoine)|publisher=culture.gouv.fr |accessdate=13 April 2014 |url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/LH/LH008/PG/FRDAFAN83_OL0098044v001.htm}}</ref> One source stated that he received the knight's cross of the L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur (again) on 28 August 1817. That year he became mayor of Guise and  was granted a patent of nobility as a [[chevalier]] on 28 March 1818. He died at Guise on 3 November 1821.{{sfn|Dupuis|1909|p=92}}
