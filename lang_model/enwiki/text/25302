'''"Temptations"''' is a song by [[rap (music)|rap]] artist [[Tupac Shakur]] (2Pac) from the album ''[[Me Against the World]]''. It was released as a single on June 4, 1996, and was released as a [[compact disc|CD]], [[Cassette single|cassette]], and [[LP record|12" promo]]. While rapping is solely performed by Shakur, [[Erick Sermon]] and [[record producer|producer]] [[Easy Mo Bee]] are also featured in the song, primarily as background vocalists. The song uses the [[bassline]] from the "[[Computer Love (Zapp & Roger song)|Computer Love]]", and the theme focuses on relationship and [[infidelity]] issues. Debuting at number sixty-eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the song did fairly well in the [[United States]]. It was also well received by critics, with many writers commenting on its romantic tone.

The song's music video does not have any [[Shot (filmmaking)|shots]] of Shakur, since he was incarcerated at the time. Instead, the video features many celebrities such as [[Coolio]], [[Ice-T]], [[Adina Howard]], and [[Warren G]]. Taking place in a [[hotel]], the video opens and closes with the [[concierge]] (Ice-T) complaining about Coolio (a [[bellhop|bellboy]]). The main plot of the video follows Coolio while he is working in the [[hotel]].

==Writing and composition==
The idea for "Temptations" began in late 1993 when [[record producer]] [[Easy Mo Bee]] came to Shakur while he was on the set of ''[[Above the Rim]]'' (1994). At [[Rucker Park]] in [[New York City]], Mo Bee approached Shakur with several different songs they could sample from in the ''[[Me Against the World]]'' album. Out of the pieces he showed the rapper, Shakur favored the [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] song "[[Computer Love (Zapp & Roger song)|Computer Love]]." Despite being frequently sampled in the past by other artists, Shakur proposed that they simply speed up the [[tempo]] of "Computer Love" and use a low [[frequency]] [[Audio filter|automatic filter]] to retrieve the song's bassline.<ref name="Brown 49"/>

||format=[[Ogg]]}}
After adding new [[Beat (music)|beats]] and [[Synthesizer#Typical roles|synth pads/leads]], Mo Bee decided to add a sample of the [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Erick Sermon]] song "Watch Yo Nuggets", which contributes to much of the song's [[tenor]] section with the repeated line of "Hey."<ref name="Brown 49">{{Harvnb|Brown|2005|p=49}}</ref> The song's [[Hook (music)|hook]] samples "[[Sing a Simple Song]]" by [[Sly & the Family Stone]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Thompson|2001|p=53}}</ref> The song also features Mo Bee and some of his friends [[Vocal harmony|singing harmonies]].<ref name="Brown 49"/>

"Temptations" deals with a male-female relationship, where Shakur is<U+2014>in Mo Bee's word's<U+2014>basically saying to his significant other, "I like the time I'm spendin' with [you], but baby, I'm busy."<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandy|Daniel|2001|pp=31<U+2013>35}}</ref> Other than the theme of the relationship issues, the song also focuses on the ability for anyone to feel lonely. The lines "'cause even thugs get lonely, understand. Even the hardest of my homies need attention; catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscing." from the third verse, are explained by William Buckholz in his 2011 book, ''Understand Rap: Explanations of Confusing Rap Lyrics You and Your Grandma Can Understand.''  He states that despite having a "tough" attitude and exterior, thugs are not emotionless. Buckholz goes on to say that there are times where everyone longs for the company of someone<U+2014>be a friend or significant other<U+2014>so they can share feelings and troubles with.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buckholz|2012|p=43}}</ref>

==Music video==
Despite being the only rapper to perform in the song's musical composition, the music video neglects an appearance by Shakur because of his incarceration for [[sexual abuse]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Violanti|first=Anthony|title=Tupac Shakur Takes on a World of Persecution|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BN&p_theme=bn&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF987CAE7CF669&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]]|date=1995-04-17}}</ref> Directed by David Nelson,<ref name="latimes">{{cite web|last=Hochman|first=Steve|title=2Pac's Pals Turn Out for Tupac-Less Video|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-24/entertainment/ca-49355_1_tupac-shakur|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Eddy Hartenstein]]|date=1995-09-24}}</ref> the video features celebrity guest appearances by [[Adina Howard]], [[B-Real]], [[Bill Bellamy]], [[Cheryl James]], [[Coolio]], [[Crystal Waters]], [[DJ Spinderella]], [[Ice-T]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Jada Pinkett Smith]], [[Jasmine Guy]],    [[Kenya Moore]], [[Shock G]], [[Joe Torry]], [[Treach]], [[Warren G]], and [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]].<ref name="latimes"/><ref name=mvbillboard>{{cite journal|last=Atwood|first=Brett|title=Takes More Than Prison To Stop 2Pac|journal=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=1995-09-23|volume=107|issue=38|page=101}}</ref>

[[Image:coolio.jpg|thumb|right|Fellow [[rapping|rapper]] [[Coolio]] took the main role in the "Temptations" music video.]]

Nelson said the video's production was ambitious, stating: "It's an incredible challenge to make a creative clip of a song without the artist." He goes onto say that Coolio helped enormously because he was the first to commit to his role as the [[bellhop|bellboy]]. Nelson says that Coolio's role "provides the thread that weaves together the entire concept of the video."<ref name=mvbillboard/> Yvette Lang, who executive produced the clip for F.M. Rocks, described the filming to be like a "big party" to show their support for Shakur.<ref name=mvbillboard/> Ice-T's role as the [[hotel]] [[concierge]] was not originally intended. At first, there was a comedian set to play his role, but he ended up cancelling at the last minute. Since Ice-T was only available to shoot in the morning, Nelson decided to make him the concierge. The director called it a "strange blessing" since he is more memorable as a concierge, rather than his intended role.<ref name=mvbillboard/>

{{quote
 |text = "I shot the clip as if it were a movie, and the preview edit is the equivalent of a film trailer. We both wanted the video to be sexy and erotic, but not sleazy. It definitely pushes the envelope, but then it throws comedy to keep things from getting to serious."
 |sign = David Nelson
 |source = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<ref name=mvbillboard/>
}}

The music video opens with Ice-T, the concierge, and Coolio, the bellboy, in a hotel [[Lobby (room)|lobby]]. Ice-T is getting onto Coolio about how he does not put forth enough effort in his work and does not deserve the job. The song begins to play after this scene ends, and the plot follows Coolio who, while on the job, sees acts of [[strip poker]], [[lesbian]] affairs, and several sexual scenarios. The bellboy eventually is invited into one of the rooms and the music comes to an end. The video ends with a scene of Ice-T continuing to complain about the bellboy's [[work ethic]]s.<ref name=mvbillboard/>

===Controversial===
The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' inquires that the video deals with acts which lead to Shakur's imprisonment, commenting: "The clip itself practically invites that kind of scrutiny. The hotel setting and explicit sex echo Shakur's own crimes, which involved sodomy occurring in a hotel."<ref name="latimes"/> Nelson denies these claims, insisting that it is purely coincidental that Shakur was imprisoned for similar occurrences.<ref name="latimes"/>

==Reception==

===Critical===
Steve Huey at [[AllMusic]] described the piece as a romance, and said that it gave a "new meaning as an escape from the hellish pressure of everyday life."<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey|first=Steve|title=Me Against the World <U+2013> 2Pac {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards {{!}} AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/me-against-the-world-mw0000625486|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation{{!}}Rovi]]|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref> Cheo Coker of the ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' said the song is based on a slow beat and "avoids formulaic, radio-friendly material," and instead focuses on rhymes and confessions from the heart.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coker|first=Cheo|title=Me Against The World {{!}} Album Reviews {{!}} Rolling Stone|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/me-against-the-world-19980202|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner{{!}}Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]|accessdate=2013-12-31|date=1998-02-02}}</ref> Music critic [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Shakur is describing himself as a "touring rap star" with the song line: "Even though I'm known for my one-night stands, I want to be an honest man."<ref>{{cite web|title=Recordings View; Confessions of a Rapper Who Done Wrong|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/arts/recordings-view-confessions-of-a-rapper-who-done-wrong.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2013-12-31|author=[[Jon Pareles{{!}}Pareles, Jon]]|date=1995-04-09}}</ref> Jordan Spak wrote in the ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'' [[Tribune Company]] that Tupac is apologizing to his listeners and defining his stance on moral rights and wrongs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spak|first=Jordan|title=2pac: Old And New|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1996-04-12/entertainment/9604120266_1_2pac-eyez-rap|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=2013-12-31|date=1996-04-12}}</ref>
