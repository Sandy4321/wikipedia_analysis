'''Thomas William "Tommy" Smith''' (born 22 May 1980) is an [[England|English]] professional [[association footballer]], normally used as a [[Midfielder#Winger|right winger]] or a [[striker]]. Smith started his career at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], where his younger brother [[Jack Smith (footballer born 1983)|Jack]] was also a trainee. He played a part in Watford's consecutive promotions from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], reaching the [[Premier League]] in 1999. Although Watford were relegated in 2000, Smith represented his country at [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] level the following season. He left Watford to join [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on a free transfer in 2003, before moving to [[Derby County]] in 2004. He was voted Derby Player of the year in 2006, before re-joining Watford. After the club's relegation in his first season back at [[Vicarage Road]], Smith's subsequent performances earned him consecutive [[Watford Player of the Season]] awards in 2007&ndash;08 and 2008&ndash;09. At the start of the following season he was sold to Premier League side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. Smith has a good disciplinary record; {{as of|2010|1|lc=on}} he has received 16 yellow cards in career spanning 13 years, and has never been [[penalty card#red card|sent off]].
 
==Early and personal life==
Smith was born in 1980, in [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Hertfordshire]]. His father Dave was a former [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] youth team player, and helped coach with the academy during his son's time there.<ref name=wfclegends>{{citeweb|url=http://www.watfordlegends.com/Tommy_Smith.html|title=Tommy Smith|publisher=Watford legends|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=127982&cc=5739|title=Tommy Smith bio|accessdate=26 October 2009|publisher=[[ESPN]]|work=[[ESPNsoccernet]]}}</ref> His younger brother [[Jack Smith (footballer born 1983)|Jack]], born in 1983, also came through the club's youth system to become a professional player. Smith attended Hemel Hempstead school between 1991 and 1997, where along with football, he was a talented [[hurdles|hurdler]] and [[basketball]] player.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/CustomPages/CustomPage.aspx?pageID=59279|title=Lifestyle world cup special|accessdate=26 October 2009|publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing|work=HemelToday|author=Abena Bailey}}</ref>

==Career==
As a boy Smith trained with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], who had a base in [[Amersham]], and Watford, who he was with until he 12.<ref name=wfclegends/> After only playing for Comets Sports club in [[Sunday league football]] for two years, he was scouted by Watford in a county trial at the age of 14 and signed with them again.<ref name=wfclegends/> Manager [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] gave Smith his debut for Watford on 18 November 1997, bringing him on as a substitute in a 2&ndash;1 [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] win over [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]].<ref name=stats>{{citeweb|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=12983&seasonid=136|title=Tommy Smith: All time playing career|publisher=Centurycomm|work=[[Soccerbase]]|accessdate=26 October 2009}}</ref> Smith did not play another league game in 1997&ndash;98, but made eight appearances for Watford as they qualified for the play-offs in the [[1998-99 in English football|1998&ndash;99 season]], where the club gained promotion to the Premiership. He established himself in the team during the club's first [[Premier League]] season, making 23 appearances and scoring two goals, including one at [[Vicarage Road]] against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=282388|title=Watford 2&ndash;3 Manchester United|publisher=Centurycomm|work=[[Soccerbase]]|accessdate=26 October 2009}}</ref>

Although Watford were relegated in 1999&ndash;2000, Smith remained at the club, playing under [[Gianluca Vialli]] and [[Ray Lewington]], and scoring on his sole appearance for the [[England under-21]] team in a 6&ndash;1 win against [[Georgia national under-21 football team|Georgia under-21]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/sep/01/newsstory.sport5|title=Joe Cole fires young England|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Richard Williams|accessdate=28 October 2009|date=1 September 2000}}</ref> Watford finished in the bottom half of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] for three consecutive seasons, but individually Smith progressed; in 2002&ndash;03 he finished as Watford's second highest goalscorer, with nine goals in all competitions. This included crucial goals in Watford's 2003 [[FA Cup]] run. His re-taken penalty against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] was the only goal of the fifth round tie, and he also scored the winning goal against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in the quarter final, having recovered from a car crash.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2739985.stm|title=Watford stun Sunderland|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=26 October 2009|date=18 February 2003}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/2805035.stm|title=Burnley stung by Hornets|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=26 October 2009|date=9 March 2003}}</ref> However he was dropped to the bench for Watford's 2003 [[FA Cup]] semi-final with [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], with on-loan striker [[Michael Chopra]] chosen instead. He later admitted that this had left him "devastated".<ref name=dev>{{citeweb|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/mar/08/match.sunderland|title=Specialist Smith lights up Wearside|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Louise Taylor|accessdate=26 October 2009|date=8 March 2004}}</ref>

Smith chose to leave Watford at the end of the 2002&ndash;03 season. However, as he was under the age of 24, he was unable to leave without a fee being paid, and so Watford had to employ him on a monthly contract.<ref name=wfclegends/> He had a two-week trial with [[Premier League]] side [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], who did not offer him a contract for financial reasons. He then went on trial with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], but [[Glenn Roeder]] was sacked as manager, and his replacement [[Alan Pardew]] chose not to sign him permanently. Smith then spent a week on trial with Italian side [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] which he "hated".<ref name=wfclegends/> On his return to England he started a trial with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], subsequently signing a contract in September 2003.<ref name=wfclegends/> Smith spent one season at Sunderland, helping them to finish third in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], after which they lost 5&ndash;4 on penalties to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in the play-off semi-finals.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3615939.stm|title=Ups and downs|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=31 May 2004|accessdate=27 October 2009}}</ref> For the second consecutive season Smith scored the winning goal in an FA Cup quarter final,<ref name=dev/> and this time he was selected to play in the semi-final, which Sunderland lost 1&ndash;0 to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3571953.stm|title=Sunderland 0&ndash;1 Millwall|date=4 April 2004|accessdate=26 October 2009|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> Smith bought a house in the Sunderland area and anticipated discussing a two-year contract at the end of the 2003&ndash;04 season.<ref name=wfclegends/> However, talks stalled and he chose to move to another [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club, [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.dcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10270~535050,00.html|title=Rams swoop for Tommy Smith|publisher=[[Derby County Football Club]]|accessdate=4 January 2010|date=17 November 2004}}</ref>

Smith scored his first league goal of his second spell at Watford on 26 December 2006, against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Vicarage Road]].
