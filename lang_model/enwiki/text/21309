Ontario is bordered by the province of [[Manitoba]] to the west, [[Hudson Bay]] and [[James Bay]] to the north, and [[Quebec]] to the east, and to the south by the [[U.S. state]]s of [[Minnesota]], [[Michigan]], [[New York]], [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. All but a small part of Ontario's {{convert|2700|km|0|abbr=on}} border with the United States follows [[Navigability|inland waterways]]: from the west at [[Lake of the Woods]], eastward along the major rivers and lakes of the [[Great Lakes]]/[[Saint Lawrence River]] drainage system. These are the [[Rainy River (Minnesota<U+2013>Ontario)|Rainy River]], the [[Pigeon River (Minnesota<U+2013>Ontario)|Pigeon River]], [[Lake Superior]], the [[St. Marys River (Michigan<U+2013>Ontario)|St. Marys River]], [[Lake Huron]], the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], the [[Detroit River]], [[Lake Erie]], the [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Ontario]] and along the St. Lawrence River from [[Kingston, Ontario]], to the Quebec boundary just east of [[Cornwall, Ontario]].

Ontario is sometimes conceptually divided into two regions, [[Northern Ontario]] and [[Southern Ontario]]. The great majority of Ontario's population and its [[arable land]] is located in the south. In contrast, the larger, northern part of Ontario is sparsely populated.

==Etymology==
The province is named after Lake Ontario, a term thought to be derived from ''Ontar<U+00ED>:io'', a [[Wyandot language|Huron]] ([[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]) word meaning "great lake",<ref>{{cite book|last=Mithun|first=Marianne|year=2000|title=The Languages of Native North America|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=312}}</ref> or possibly ''skanadario'', which means "beautiful water" in the [[Iroquoian languages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studycanada.ca/english/about-ont.htm|pages=Last Paragraph-second last sentence|title=About Canada // Ontario|work=Study Canada|quote=The name "Ontario" is generally thought to be derived from the Iroquois word Skanadario, meaning "beautiful water"|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> Ontario contains about 250,000 freshwater lakes.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Ontario}}
{{See also|Census divisions of Ontario|Geography of Canada}}
{{See also|List of protected areas of Ontario|l1=List of parks and protected areas of Ontario}}

[[File:Algonquin Cache Lake Lookout.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Algonquin Provincial Park]], Cache Lake]]

The province consists of three main geographical regions:
*The thinly populated [[Canadian Shield]] in the northwestern and central portions, which comprises over half the land area of Ontario.  Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in [[mineral]]s and in part covered by the [[Central Canadian Shield forests|Central]] and [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]], studded with lakes and rivers. [[Northern Ontario]] is subdivided into two sub-regions: [[Northwestern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]].

*The virtually unpopulated [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested.

*[[Southern Ontario]] which is further sub-divided into four regions; [[Central Ontario]] (although not actually the province's geographic centre), [[Eastern Ontario]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] and [[Southwestern Ontario]] (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario).

Despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the [[Niagara Escarpment]] which crosses the south. The highest point is [[Ishpatina Ridge]] at {{convert|693|m}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] located in [[Temagami|Temagami, Northeastern Ontario]]. In the south, elevations of over {{convert|500|m|2|abbr=on}} are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the [[Madawaska River (Ontario)|Madawaska River]] in [[Renfrew County]].

The [[Carolinian forest]] zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the [[Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]] where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is [[Niagara Falls]], part of the [[Niagara Escarpment]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] allows navigation to and from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as far inland as [[Thunder Bay]] in Northwestern Ontario. [[Northern Ontario]] occupies roughly 87% of the surface area of the province; conversely Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population.

[[Point Pelee National Park|Point Pelee]] is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]) that is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland. [[Pelee, Ontario|Pelee Island]] and [[Middle Island (Lake Erie)|Middle Island]] in Lake  Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of [[42nd parallel north|42<U+00B0>N]]&nbsp;<U+2013> slightly farther south than the northern border of [[California]].

The climate of Ontario varies largely from season to season and from one location to another.<ref name=EC>{{cite web | url = http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/canada-country-study/intro.html | title = The Canada Country Study: Climate Impacts and Adaptation: Ontario Region Executive Summary | publisher = Environment Canada | accessdate = January 29, 2013}}</ref> The climate of Ontario is affected by 3 air sources: cold, dry and polar air from the north (dominant factor during the winter months); Pacific polar air passing over the western prairies and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=UBCgeo>{{cite web | first1 = David | last1 = Baldwin | first2 = Joseph | last2 = Desloges | first3 = Lawrence | last3 = Band| url = http://www.ubcpress.ca/books/pdf/chapters/ecology/chapter2.pdf | title = Physical Geography of Ontario | publisher = UBC Press | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}</ref> The effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude, proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent, terrain relief.<ref name= UBCgeo/> In general, most of Ontario's climate is classified as humid continental.<ref name= UBCgeo/> Ontario has three main climatic regions.

The surrounding Great Lakes greatly influence the climate of southern Ontario.<ref name="EC"/> During the fall and winter months, heat stored from the lakes is released, moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes.<ref name=EPA>{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas/glat-ch2.html | title = Natural Processes in the Great Lakes | publisher = US Environmental Protection Agency | accessdate = March 25, 2013}}</ref> This makes some parts of southern Ontario have milder winters than mid-continental areas at lower latitudes.<ref name= EPA/> Parts of Southwestern Ontario have a moderate [[humid continental climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), similar to that of the inland [[Mid-Atlantic states]] and the [[Great Lakes]] portion of the [[Midwestern United States]]. The region has warm, humid summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|750|-|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} and is well distributed throughout the year. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes, making for abundant snow in some areas. In December 2010, the [[snowbelt]] set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within 48 hours.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2010/12/08/snow-storm-ontario.html | work=CBC News | title=Snowstorm shuts down London, Ont | date=December 8, 2010}}</ref> Central and Eastern Ontario have a moderate [[humid continental climate]] (K<U+00F6>ppen ''Dfb''). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder, longer winters, ample snowfall and annual precipitation similar to the rest of Southern Ontario. Precipitation in Central and Eastern Ontario varies dramatically, with the driest areas in the northwest and the wettest areas in the southeast.<ref name= UBCgeo/>

The climate can vary across the province. In the northeastern parts of Ontario, extending far as south as Kirkland Lake, the cold Hudson Bay depresses summer temperatures, making it cooler than other locations in Canada or Ontario at similar latitudes.<ref name= UBCgeo/> Along the shorelines of Lake Superior and Lake Huron, winter temperatures are moderated, although on the eastern shores of [[Lake Superior]] and [[Lake Huron]], frequent heavy [[lake-effect snow]] squalls increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in some places. Along the northern shorelines of Lake of Superior, the lake has a cooling effect on the flow of warm summer air, creating cooler summers than inland areas.<ref name= UBCgeo/>
The northernmost parts of Ontario&nbsp;<U+2014> primarily north of 50<U+00B0>N&nbsp;<U+2014> have a [[subarctic climate]] (K<U+00F6>ppen ''Dfc'') with long, severely cold winters and short, cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking [[Arctic]] [[air mass]]es, temperatures of {{convert|-40|C|abbr=on}} are not uncommon; snowfall remains on the ground for sometimes over half the year. Snowfall accumulation can be high in some areas.<ref name= EC/> Precipitation is generally less than {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} and is concentrated in the summer months in the form of summer showers or thunderstorms.<ref name= EC/>

Severe [[thunderstorm]]s peak in summer. [[London, Ontario|London]], situated in [[Southern Ontario|Southern]] [[Southwestern Ontario|(Southwestern)]] Ontario, has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada, averaging 34 days of thunderstorm activity per year. In a typical year, Ontario averages 11 confirmed [[tornado]] touchdowns, where more are reported in the Windsor-Essex - Chatham Kent area, though many are seldom destructive (the majority between F0 to F2 on the [[Fujita scale]]) and only few are stronger and very destructive. Ontario witnessed 29 tornadoes in 2009 which tied its record for the most tornadoes in one year set in 2006.[[Tropical cyclone|Tropical depression]] remnants occasionally bring heavy rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. A notable exception was [[Hurricane Hazel]] which struck Southern Ontario, in October 1954.

===Territorial evolution===
[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|right|alt=When Canada was formed in 1867 its provinces were a relatively narrow strip in the southeast, with vast territories in the interior. It grew by adding British Columbia in 1871, P.E.I. in 1873, the British Arctic Islands in 1880, and Newfoundland in 1949; meanwhile, its provinces grew both in size and number at the expense of its territories.|Evolution of the borders of Ontario.<br/>View [[Media:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|full resolution]] for time-lapsed evolution]]
Land was not legally subdivided into administrative units until a treaty had been concluded with the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|native peoples ceding the land]]. In 1788, while part of the [[Province of Quebec (1763<U+2013>1791)]], southern Ontario was divided into four [[District#Ontario|districts]]: [[Western District, Upper Canada|Hesse]], [[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Lunenburg]], [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Mecklenburg]], and [[Home District|Nassau]].

In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts.

By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, [[Johnstown District, Upper Canada|Johnstown]], [[London District, Upper Canada|London]], Midland, [[Newcastle District|Newcastle]], [[Niagara District|Niagara]], and Western.

By 1826, there were eleven districts: [[Bathurst District|Bathurst]], Eastern, [[Gore District, Upper Canada|Gore]], Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, [[Ottawa District|Ottawa]], and Western.

By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, [[Dalhousie District|Dalhousie]], Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, [[Simcoe County|Simcoe]], Talbot, Victoria, [[Wellington District, Upper Canada|Wellington]], and Western.

In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the [[Province of Canada]], and [[county]] governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating ''districts'' in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of [[Algoma District]] and [[Nipissing District]] in 1858.

The borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]. With Canada's acquisition of [[Rupert's Land]], Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the [[51st parallel north]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Report on the Boundaries of the Province of Ontario | author=Mills, David | publisher=Hunter, Rose & Co. | location=[[Toronto]] | page=347 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BlYCAAAAMAAJ | year=1877 | accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref>

The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after [[Canadian Confederation]]. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in 1884 and confirmed by the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889'' of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Districts and Counties 1788<U+2013>1899|publisher=Archives of Ontario|date=September 5, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2006|url=http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/ontario-districts.aspx}}</ref>

The British established [[trading post]]s on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]] ended the [[Seven Years' War]] by awarding nearly all of [[French colonization of the Americas|France's North American possessions]] ([[New France]]) to Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_%281763%29|title=The Treaty of Paris (1763)|accessdate=January 5, 2007}}</ref> The region was annexed to Quebec in 1774.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/PreConfederation/qa_1774.html|title=The Quebec Act of 1774|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref> From 1783 to 1796, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] granted [[United Empire Loyalist]]s leaving the United States following the [[American Revolution]] {{convert|200|acre|abbr=on}} land and other items with which to rebuild their lives.<ref name="thefrenchshouldvewon"/>

This measure substantially increased the population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence during this period, a fact recognized by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], which split Quebec into [[the Canadas]]: [[Upper Canada]] southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and [[Lower Canada]] east of it. [[John Graves Simcoe]] was appointed Upper Canada's first [[Lieutenant governor (Canada)|Lieutenant governor]] in 1793.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~sprague/con91.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070829152801/http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~sprague/con91.htm|archivedate=August 29, 2007|title=The Constitutional Act of 1791|accessdate=January 15, 2007}}</ref>

===Upper Canada===
{{Main|Upper Canada}}
American troops in the [[War of 1812]] invaded Upper Canada across the [[Niagara River]] and the [[Detroit River]], but were defeated and pushed back by British regulars, Canadian [[fencibles]] and militias, and [[First Nations]] warriors. However,  eventually the Americans gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. During the [[Battle of York]] in 1813, American troops occupied the [[York, Upper Canada|Town of York]]. The Americans looted the town and burned the Parliament Buildings during the brief occupation.

After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this deliberate immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time.

Meanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied [[Hydropower|water power]] for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada</ref>

Many in the colony however, began to chafe against the aristocratic [[Family Compact]] who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies the power to effect change (much as the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau Clique]] ruled Lower Canada). This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early [[Canadian nationalism]]. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of [[responsible government]] rose in both regions; [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] led the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] and [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] led the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]].

===Canada West===
{{main|Province of Canada}}
Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] to investigate the causes of the unrest. He recommended that self-government be granted and that Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the [[French Canadian]]s. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'', with the capital at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], and Upper Canada becoming known as [[Province of Canada|Canada West]]. Parliamentary [[Self-governance|self-government]] was granted in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of [[Canada East]], tilting the representative balance of power.

An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and a reciprocity agreement in place with United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously.

A political stalemate between the [[Canadian French|French]]- and [[Canadian English|English]]-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the [[American Civil War]], led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all [[British North America]]n colonies. The ''British North America Act'' took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]] to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of Protestant and the Catholic minority. Thus, separate Catholic schools and [[board of education|school boards]] were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital.

===Provincehood===

[[File:Skyline of Toronto viewed from Harbour.jpg|thumb|[[Toronto]], the capital of Ontario]]
Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer [[Oliver Mowat]] became [[Premier of Ontario]] and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly [[Decentralization|decentralized]] Canada, giving the provinces far more power than [[John A. Macdonald]] had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the [[District of Keewatin]]) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889''. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called ''Empire Ontario''.

Beginning with Sir John A. Macdonald's [[National Policy]] (1879) and the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (1875<U+2013>1885) through Northern Ontario and the [[Canadian Prairies]] to [[British Columbia]], Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario.

[[Mineral]] exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]] and [[Timmins]]. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later [[Ontario Hydro]]. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]] was established in 1904. [[General Motors Canada]] was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry would go on to become the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century.

In July 1912, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government of Sir [[James Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denouncing the "Prussians of Ontario". The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927.

Influenced by events in the United States, the government of Sir [[William Howard Hearst|William Hearst]] introduced [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the [[Ontario Temperance Act]]. However, residents could distill and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] under the government of [[Howard Ferguson]]. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. In April 2007, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament [[Kim Craitor]] suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]].

The post-[[World War II]] period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal [[immigration law]], a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely [[ethnic group|ethnically]] British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse.

The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the ''[[Parti Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]]'' in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result Toronto surpassed [[Montreal]] as the largest city and economic centre of Canada. Depressed economic conditions in the [[Atlantic Canada|Maritime Provinces]] have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.

Ontario's official language is [[English language|English]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ontario.ca/government/about-ontario | title=About Ontario | publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario | date=August 1, 2013 | accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> Numerous [[French language]] services are available under the [[French Language Services Act]] of 1990 in designated areas where sizable [[francophone]] populations exist.

In the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 census]], Ontario had a population of 12,851,821 living in 4,887,508 of its 5,308,785 total dwellings, a 5.7% change from its 2006 population of 12,160,282. With a land area of {{convert|908,607.67|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it had a population density of {{Pop density|12851821|908607.67|km2|sqmi|prec=1}} in 2011.<ref name=StatCan2011/> In 2013, Statistics Canada estimated the province's population to be 13,537,994.<ref name=estimates>{{Cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/130926/dq130926a-eng.pdf | title=Canada's total population estimates, 2013 | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=September 26, 2013 | accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref>

The percentages given below add to more than 100% because of dual responses (e.g., "French and Canadian" response generates an entry both in the category "[[French Canadian]]" and in the category "[[Canadians|Canadian]]").

The majority of Ontarians are of [[English Canadian|English]] or other [[European Canadian|European descent]] including large Scottish, Irish and Italian communities. Slightly less than 5% of the population of Ontario is [[Franco-Ontarian]], that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11% of the population. In relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration, [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]] is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it has been over the last two centuries. More recent sources of [[Immigration|immigrants]] with large or growing communities in Ontario include [[Caribbean]]s, [[Latin America]]ns, [[Europe]]ans, [[Asia]]ns, and [[Africa]]ns. Most populations have settled in the larger urban centres.

Ontario has a diverse population, with 25.9% of the population consisting of [[visible minorities]] and 2.4% of the population being [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]], mostly of [[First Nations]] and [[Metis people (Canada)|Metis]] decent. There is also a small number of [[Inuit]] people in the province.  The number of Aboriginal people has been increasing at rates greater than the general population of Ontario.<ref>http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Ontario&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=All&B1=All&GeoLevel=PR&GeoCode=35</ref>

===Religion===
As of 2011, the largest religious denominations in Ontario are the Roman Catholic Church (with 31.4% of the population), the United Church of Canada (7.5%), and the Anglican Church (6.1%). 23.1% of Ontarians have no religion, making it the second largest religious grouping in the province after Roman Catholics.

===Language===
The principal language of Ontario is [[English language|English]], which is spoken natively by about 70% of the province's population as of the 2011 census. There is also a significant [[French language|French]]-speaking population concentrated in the central and eastern parts of the province, where under the [[French Language Services Act]], provincial government services are required to be available in French if at least 10% of a designated area's population report French as their native language. Immigrant languages such as Italian, Tamil, Chinese and Punjabi are also found in the province.<ref>[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/tbt-tt/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=1&LANG=E&APATH=3&DETAIL=0&DIM=0&FL=A&FREE=0&GC=0&GID=908351&GK=0&GRP=1&PID=103251&PRID=0&PTYPE=101955&S=0&SHOWALL=0&SUB=0&Temporal=2011&THEME=90&VID=0&VNAMEE=&VNAMEF=&D1=0&D2=0&D3=0&D4=0&D5=0&D6=0] Canada Census, 2011</ref>

An abundance of [[natural resource]]s, excellent transportation links to the American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via [[container ship]]s, have all contributed to making [[manufacturing]] the principal [[industry]], found mainly in the Golden Horseshoe region, which is the largest industrialized area in Canada, the southern end of the region being part of the North American [[Rust Belt]]. Important products include [[motor vehicle]]s, [[iron]], [[steel]], food, electrical appliances, machinery, [[chemical substance|chemicals]], and [[paper]].

Ontario surpassed Michigan in [[automobile|car]] production, assembling 2.696 million vehicles in 2004. Ontario has [[Chrysler]] plants in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and Bramalea, two [[General Motors|GM]] plants in Oshawa and one in Ingersoll, a [[Honda]] assembly plant in Alliston, [[Ford]] plants in Oakville and St. Thomas and [[Toyota]] assembly plants in Cambridge and Woodstock.  However, as a result of steeply declining sales, in 2005, [[General Motors]] announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America including two large GM plants in [[Oshawa]] and a [[Powertrain|drive train]] facility in [[St. Catharines]] resulting in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. In 2006, [[Ford Motor Company]] announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the [[St. Thomas, Ontario|St. Thomas]] facility and the [[Windsor Casting]] plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford's recent announcement of a [[hybrid vehicle]] facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] plant and GM's re-introduction of the [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro]] which will be produced in Oshawa. On December 4, 2008 [[Toyota]] announced the grand opening of the [[Toyota RAV4|RAV4]] plant in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://woodstocksentinelreview.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1346620 |title=Toyota's opening a new chapter in Woodstock's industrial history |publisher=Woodstocksentinelreview.com |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2010}}</ref> and [[Honda]] also has plans to add an engine plant at its facility in [[Alliston, Ontario|Alliston]]. Despite these new plants coming online, Ontario has not yet fully recovered following massive layoffs caused by the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|global recession]]; its unemployment rate was 7.3% (as of May 2013),<ref>[http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/indi02g-eng.htm "Economic indicators, by province and territory (monthly and quarterly) - (Ontario)", June 2011], Statistics Canada</ref> compared to 8.7% in Jan. 2010<ref>[http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/LABOR07b-eng.htm "Labour force, employed and unemployed, numbers and rates, by province - (Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba)", 2010], Statistics Canada</ref> and roughly 6% in 2007.

Ontario's steel industry was once centred around [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]].  Hamilton harbour, which can be seen as one drives the [[QEW]] Skyway bridge, is an industrial wasteland; [[US Steel]]-owned [[Stelco]] announced in fall 2013 that it would be shuttered in 2014, with the loss of 875 jobs.  The move flummoxed a union representative, who seemed puzzled why a plant with capacity of 2 million tons per annum would be shut while Canada imported 8 million tons of steel last year.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-steel-to-shut-down-hamilton-works-ceo-says/article15142440/ 29 Oct 2013 "U.S. Steel ends an era in Hamilton"]</ref>  [[Algoma Steel]] still maintains a plant in [[Sault Ste Marie]].

Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the centre of Canada's [[financial services]] and banking industry. Neighbouring cities are home to product distribution, IT centres, and various manufacturing industries. Canada's Federal Government is the largest single employer in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]], which centres on the border cities of Ontario's Ottawa and Quebec's [[Gatineau]].<ref>[http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/govt58a-eng.htm "Federal government employment, wages and salaries, by census metropolitan area - (Employment)", 2006<U+2013>2010], Statistics Canada</ref><ref>[http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/lfss04d-eng.htm "Labour force characteristics, unadjusted, by census metropolitan area (3 month moving average) - (Ottawa-Gatineau (Ont.-Que.), Ottawa (Ont.)-Gatineau (Que.), Ontario part, Ottawa (Ont.)-Gatineau (Que.), Quebec part)", 2010/2011], Statistics Canada</ref>

The [[information technology]] sector is important, particularly in the ''[[Silicon Valley North]]'' section of [[Ottawa]], as well as the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo Region]], where the world headquarters of [[Research in Motion]] (the developers of the [[BlackBerry]] smartphone) is located.

[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] is the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada, and [[Sarnia]] is the centre for [[petrochemical]] production.

[[Mining]] and the [[forestry|forest products]] industry, notably [[pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]], are vital to the economy of Northern Ontario. There has been controversy over the [[Ring of Fire]] mineral deposit, and whether the province can afford to spend CAD$2.25bn on a road from the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] near [[Kenora]] to the deposit, currently valued at CAD$60bn.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/ontario-disappointed-as-mining-firm-suspends-project-in-ring-of-fire/article15547837/ "Cliffs' pullout forces Ontario action in Ring of Fire mining area" G+M 21 Nov 2013]</ref>

Tourism contributes heavily to the economy of Central Ontario, peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of [[fresh water]] recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres. At other times of the year, [[hunting]], [[skiing]] and [[snowmobile|snowmobiling]] are popular. This region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent, and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them. Tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos, among them Windsor, [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]], Sarnia and [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], which attract many U.S. visitors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ontario|publisher=Ministry of Economic Development and Trade|accessdate=November 29, 2006|url=http://www.2ontario.com/welcome/oo_000.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061024224855/http://www.2ontario.com/welcome/oo_000.asp|archivedate=October 24, 2006}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
[[File:Niagara fruit 1914.jpg|right|thumb|Fruit from the Niagara region for distribution, ca. 1914]]
Once the dominant industry, [[agriculture]] occupies a small percentage of the population but still a large part of Southern Ontario's land area. As the following table shows, while the number of individual farms has steadily decreased and their overall size has shrunk at a lower rate, greater mechanization has supported increased supply to satisfy the ever increasing demands of a growing population base; this has also meant a gradual increase in the total amount of land used for growing crops.
{{Ontario Farming Stats}}

Cattle, small grains and [[dairy]] were the common types of farms in the 2001 census. The fruit and grape growing industry is located primarily on the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and along Lake Erie, where [[tobacco]] farms are also situated. Market Vegetables
are also grown in the rich soils of the [[Holland Marsh]] near [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]].  The area near [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] is also very fertile.  The Heinz plant in [[Leamington]] was taken over in fall 2013 by [[Warren Buffet]] and a Brazilian partner, and subsequently lost its contract to supply [[McDonald's]], following which it put 740 people out of work.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/heinz-closes-leamington-plant-740-people-out-of-work-1.2426608 "Heinz closes Leamington plant, 740 people out of work" 14 Nov 2013 CBC.ca]</ref>  Government subsidies followed shortly; Premier [[Kathleen Wynne]] offered CAD$200k to cushion the blow, and promised that another processed food operator would soon be found.<ref>[http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/wynne-offers-200k-to-help-leamington-in-wake-of-heinz-closure-1.1556263 "Wynne offers $200K to help Leamington in wake of Heinz closure" 22 Nov 2013 ctvnews.ca]</ref>

The area defined as the [[Corn Belt]] covers much of the southwestern area of the province extending as far north as close to Goderich, but corn and soy are grown throughout the southern portion of the province. Apple orchards are a common sight along the southern shore of [[Nottawasaga Bay]] (part of Georgian Bay) near Collingwood and along the northern shore of Lake Ontario near Cobourg. Tobacco production, centred in [[Norfolk County, Ontario|Norfolk County]] has decreased leading to an increase in some other new crop alternatives gaining popularity, such as [[Corylus avellana|hazelnuts]] and [[ginseng]]. The Ontario origins of [[Massey Ferguson]], once one of the largest [[Agricultural machinery|farm implement]] manufacturers in the world, indicate the importance agriculture once had to the Canadian economy.
[[Southern Ontario]]'s limited supply of agricultural land is going out of production at an increasing rate. [[Urban sprawl]] and farmland severances contribute to the loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and {{convert|150000|acre|abbr=on}} of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18% of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural severances provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production.

===Energy===

[[File:Bruce-Nuclear-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|The [[CANDU]] [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]] on Lake Huron is the largest [[nuclear power]] plant in the world.]]
The Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 (GEA), takes a two-pronged approach to creating a Renewable energy commercialization. The first is to bring more [[Renewable resource|renewable energy sources]] to the province and the second is the creation of more [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] measures to help [[energy conservation|conserve energy]]. The bill would also appoint a Renewable Energy Facilitator to provide "one-window" assistance and support to project developers in order to facilitate project approvals.<ref name="renewableenergyworld1">{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/02/ontario-unveils-green-energy-and-green-economy-act-2009?cmpid=WNL-Friday-February27-2009 |title=Ontario Unveils Green Energy and Green Economy Act, 2009 |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2010}}</ref>

The approvals process for transmission projects would also be [[wikt:streamline|streamline]]d and for the first time in Ontario, the bill would enact standards for renewable energy projects. Homeowners would have access to incentives to develop small-scale renewables such as low- or no-interest [[loan]]s to finance the capital cost of renewable energy generating facilities like solar panels.<ref name="renewableenergyworld1"/>

Ontario is home to [[Niagara Falls]], which supplies a large amount of hydroelectricity for the province.  The [[Bruce Nuclear Generating Station]], the largest [[nuclear power]] plant in the world, is also in Ontario and uses 8 [[CANDU reactor]]s to generate electricity for the province.

==Government, the law & politics==
{{Further|Monarchy in Ontario|Executive Council of Ontario}}

[[File:Queen's Park.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario Legislature]] at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] in [[Toronto]].]]

[[File:Ontario-wordmark.svg|thumb|upright|The previous wordmark of the Government of Ontario, which was in use from the late-1960s until 2007 (apart from the lettering used here).]]
The ''British North America Act 1867'' section 69 stipulated "There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the Lieutenant Governor and of One House, styled the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]." The assembly has 107 seats representing [[electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] elected in a [[Plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]] system across the province.

The legislative buildings at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]] are the seat of government. Following the [[Westminster system]], the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the "Premier and President of the Council" (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] or [[Executive Council of Ontario|Executive Council]] whose members are deemed [[ministers of the Crown]].

Although the ''Legislative Assembly Act (R.S.O. 1990)'' refers to members of the assembly", the legislators are now commonly called MPPs ([[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Members of the Provincial Parliament]]) in English and ''d<U+00E9>put<U+00E9>s de l'Assembl<U+00E9>e l<U+00E9>gislative'' in French, but they have also been called MLAs ([[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]]), and both are acceptable. The title of Prime Minister of Ontario, correct in French (''le Premier ministre''), is permissible in English but now generally avoided in favour of the title "Premier" to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada.

===The Law===

Ontario has grown, from its roots in [[Upper Canada]], into a modern jurisdiction.  The old titles of the chief law officers, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, remain in use.  They both are responsible to the Legislature.  The Attorney-General drafts the laws and is responsible for criminal prosecutions and the administration of justice, while the Solicitor-General is responsible for law enforcement and the police services of the province.  

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Ontario}}
Ontario has numerous political parties which run for election. The three main parties are the [[Ontario Liberal Party]], the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]], and the social-democratic [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] (NDP). Each of the three parties has received a majority mandate during a provincial election since [[Ontario general election, 1990|1990]].

Ontario is led by the minority government of Liberal Premier [[Kathleen Wynne]]. Since gaining power under former Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]] in [[Ontario general election, 2003|2003]], the Liberal Party has been re-elected twice in the [[Ontario general election, 2007|2007]] and [[Ontario general election, 2011|2011]] general elections. Unlike its previous two mandates, the party only achieved a minority mandate in the 2011 general election by capturing 53 seats (as opposed to the 71 it won in 2007), with the Progressive Conservatives winning 37 and the NDP winning 17 seats. Wynne replaced McGuinty as party leader and Premier, following a leadership convention in 2013.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]] in Ontario the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] were elected in 73 ridings, the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|NDP]] in 22, and the Liberals in 11. The [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]] did not win a seat in Ontario.

In Ontario, education falls under provincial jurisdiction.  Publicly funded elementary and secondary schools are administered by the [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Education]], while colleges and universities are administered by the  [[Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities|Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities]].

Each higher education system aims to improve participation, access, and mobility for students.  There are two central organizations that assist with the process of applying to Ontario universities and colleges: the [[Ontario Universities' Application Centre]] and [[Ontario College Application Service]]. While application services are centralized, admission and selection processes vary and are the purview of each institution independently.  Admission to many Ontario postsecondary institutions can be highly competitive. Upon admission, students may get involved with regional student representation with the [[Canadian Federation of Students]], the [[Canadian Alliance of Student Associations]], the [[Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance]], or through the [[College Student Alliance]] in Ontario.

==Transportation==
Historically, the province has used two major east-west routes, both starting from Montreal in the neighbouring province  of Quebec. The northerly route, which was mostly pioneered by early [[fur trade]]rs, travels west from Montreal along the [[Ottawa River]], then continues northwestward towards Manitoba. Major cities on or near the route include Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], and Thunder Bay. The southerly route, which was driven by growth in settlements originated by the United Empire Loyalists and later other [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European immigrants]], travels southwest from Montreal along the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie before entering the United States in Michigan. Major cities on or near the route include Kingston, Oshawa, Toronto, Mississauga, [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Kitchener-Waterloo]], Hamilton, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. This route was also heavily used by immigrants to the Midwestern US particularly in the late 19th century.

===Roads===
{{Main|Roads in Ontario}}

[[400-series highways (Ontario)|400-Series Highways]] make up the primary vehicular network in the south of province, and they connect to numerous border crossings with the U.S., the busiest being the [[Detroit<U+2013>Windsor Tunnel]] and [[Ambassador Bridge]] (via [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]]) and the [[Blue Water Bridge]] (via [[Ontario Highway 402|Highway 402]]). Some of the primary highways along the southern route are Highway 401, [[Ontario Highway 417|Highway 417]], and [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]],<ref name=Ontario>{{cite web | title=Ontario government investing $401 million to upgrade Highway 401 | url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2002/08/06/c0057.html?lmatch=&lang=_e.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070914064434/http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2002/08/06/c0057.html?lmatch=&lang=_e.html | archivedate=September 14, 2007 | accessdate=December 20, 2006 | date=August 6, 2002 | author=Ministry of Transportation (Ontario) }}</ref><ref name=Highway>{{cite web

===Waterways===
The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the Atlantic Ocean, is the primary [[water transportation]] route for cargo, particularly [[iron ore]] and grain. In the past, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River were also a major passenger transportation route, but over the past half century passenger travel has been reduced to ferry services and sightseeing cruises.

===Railways===
[[Via Rail]] operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the [[Quebec City <U+2013> Windsor Corridor]], along with ''[[The Canadian]]'', a transcontinental rail service from Southern Ontario to [[Vancouver]], and the [[Sudbury <U+2013> White River train]]. Additionally, [[Amtrak]] rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and [[New York City]]. [[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]] provides rail service to destinations as far north as [[Moosonee, Ontario|Moosonee]] near [[James Bay]], connecting them with the south.

[[Freight train|Freight rail]] is dominated by the founding cross-country [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP Rail]] companies, which during the 1990s sold many [[Short-line railroad|short rail lines]] from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south.

Regional [[commuter rail]] is limited to the provincially owned [[GO Transit]], and serves a trainbus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region.

The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] operates the province's only [[Toronto subway and RT|subway]] and [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]] system, one of the busiest in North America. [[OC Transpo]] operates, in addition to bus service, Ontario's only [[light rail]] transit line, the [[Ottawa O-Train|O-Train]] in Ottawa. Currently, a light-rail metro called the [[Confederation Line]] is under construction in [[Ottawa]]. It will have 13 stations on {{convert|12.5|km|1|abbr=on}} and part of it will run under the city's [[downtown Ottawa|Downtown]] and feature three subway stations.

===Air travel===
Important airports in the province include [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], which is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|busiest airport in Canada]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/51-209-x/2011001/t002-eng.htm| title=Total aircraft movements by class of operation <U+2014> NAV CANADA towers| publisher=Statcan.gc.ca| accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Toronto Pearson Fast Facts| url=http://www.torontopearson.com/en/press/toronto-pearson-fast-facts/#| publisher=GTAA| accessdate=2013-01-02}}</ref> [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport]] and Hamilton's [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]]. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point being [[Montr<U+00E9>al-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]).

Most Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from [[Air Canada Jazz]] or smaller airlines and charter companies&nbsp;<U+2014> flights from the mid-size  cities such as Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Windsor, London, and Kingston feed directly into larger airports in Toronto and Ottawa. [[Bearskin Airlines]] also runs flights along the northerly east-west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener and Thunder Bay directly.

Isolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on [[airline|air service]] for travel, goods, and even [[air ambulance|ambulance]] services ([[Medical evacuation|MEDIVAC]]), since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail.
