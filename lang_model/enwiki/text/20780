'''USS ''Finland'' (ID-4543)''' was a [[transport]] for the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]]. From her launch until 1917, she was known as '''SS ''Finland''''' for several subsidiary lines of [[International Mercantile Marine Co.|International Mercantile Marine]]. Before her Navy service, she was also '''USAT ''Finland''''' for the [[United States Army]].

SS ''Finland'' was built in 1902 as an [[ocean liner]] for the [[Red Star Line]], and also sailed [[Chartering (shipping)|under charter]] for the [[White Star Line]], the [[Panama Pacific Line]], and the [[American Line]], all subsidiaries of International Mercantile Marine. Sailing out of [[New York City|New York]], she sailed primarily to ports in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Belgium]], and [[Italy]]. She also briefly sailed on New York to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], service. In 1912, ''Finland'' was chartered by the [[American Olympic Committee]] to take the U.S. team to the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

At the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, the liner was chartered by the [[United States Army]] as USAT ''Finland''. She made five transatlantic runs under Army control ferrying troops to Europe. On the return portion of her third voyage, ''Finland'' was torpedoed by [[Unterseeboot 93 (1917)|''U-93'']], but was able to safely return to port for repairs. In April 1918, ''Finland'' was transferred to the U.S Navy and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] as USS ''Finland''. She completed an additional five voyages to Europe, carrying almost 13,000&nbsp;troops. After the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]], she returned over 32,000&nbsp;troops to the United States before being decommissioned in September 1919. 

After her Navy service ended, she was returned to International Mercantile Marine, resumed her original name of SS ''Finland'', and served on New York to Europe routes until 1923, when she returned to New York<U+2013>San Francisco service. ''Finland'' was scrapped in 1928.

== Launching and early career ==
''Finland'' was launched on [[21 June]] [[1902]] by [[W. Cramp and Son]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], for the [[Red Star Line]] of [[International Mercantile Marine Co.|International Mercantile Marine]] (IMM). She was the sister ship to {{SS|Kroonland}}, launched four months prior. ''Finland'' was {{convert|560|ft|m|1}} long ([[Length between perpendiculars|LBP]]) with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|60.2|ft|m}}, and had two [[steamship funnel|funnel]]s and four [[Mast (sailing)|mast]]s. She had twin three-[[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], [[triple expansion]] [[steam engine]]s drove twin [[Propeller#Marine|screw propellors]] that moved her at {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}. She had accommodations for 342&nbsp;passengers in first class, 194&nbsp;in second class, and 626&nbsp;in third class.<ref name=Bonsor-2-856>Bonsor, p. 856.</ref>

''Finland'' sailed on her maiden voyage from New York to [[Antwerp]] on [[4 October]] under the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], and remained on this route for the next seven years.<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /> In November 1907, as the liner neared Antwerp, a gale in the [[English Channel]] almost drove ''Finland'' ashore. The timely assistance of two tugs kept the big ship from grounding on the [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]] at [[Dover]].<ref>Carson, p. 9.</ref> By January 1909, ''Finland'' had been reflagged under the [[Flag of Belgium|Belgian flag]], but remained on the New York<U+2013>Antwerp route.<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 />

In March 1909, the liner was chartered to the [[White Star Line]], another IMM subsidiary, for three roundtrip voyages between [[Naples]] and New York. Returning to the Red Star Line's New York<U+2013>Antwerp service, ''Finland'' was reflagged in January 1912, sailing under the American flag once again.<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /> During this time, noted German-American [[psychologist]] [[Hugo M<U+00FC>nsterberg]] sailed on ''Finland'' to Europe to attend a Psychological Congress in [[Berlin]] in April 1912.<ref>M<U+00FC>nsterberg, p. 228.</ref>

=== 1912 Olympics ===
The [[American Olympic Committee]] (AOC) chartered ''Finland''<U+2014>after a proposal for sailing on {{RMS|Oceanic|1899|2}} was rejected<U+2014>to take the American team to the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].<ref>Sullivan, p. 33.</ref> After setting aside rooms for all the team members, additional space aboard the ship was sold for the benefit of the AOC.<ref>Sullivan, p. 246.</ref> The delegation of 164&nbsp;athletes left New York at 09:30 on [[14 June]].<ref>Halpin, p. 237.</ref> {{nowrap|''Finland''&#x2009;<nowiki>'</nowiki>s}} dining rooms were divided during the voyage, so that the athletes on board would have "their own cuisine" and not be tempted to partake in "promiscuous indulgence in the great variety of food" on the ship.<ref name=Sull-37>Sullivan, p. 37.</ref>

[[Image:SS Finland underway in harbor before 1917.jpg|thumb|left|SS ''Finland'' underway in a U.S. port before [[World War I]].]]
The AOC, aided by {{nowrap|''Finland''&#x2009;<nowiki>'</nowiki>s}} crew,<ref name=Hal-239>Halpin, p. 239.</ref> made several accommodations for training on board the ship while en route to the Games. A cork track, {{convert|100|yd|m}} long and wide enough for two men to run side-by-side, was installed on the top deck, especially for the sprinters.<ref name=Sull-37 /> Longer distance runners would practice their starts on the track, but would train by running laps around the deck, which was about one-tenth of a mile (160&nbsp;m) for one circuit.<ref name=Sull-39>Sullivan, p. 39.</ref> The swimmers practiced in a canvas tank, {{convert|15|ft|m}} long by {{convert|5|ft|m}} wide, constructed on deck. While practicing their strokes, they would wear a belt suspended from an overhead rope that kept them in the middle of the tank.<ref name=Sull-39 /> The [[Cycling at the 1912 Summer Olympics|cycling team]] worked on the forward deck with bikes secured to the ship's structure.<ref name=Sull-41>Sullivan, p. 41.</ref>

Some of the individual athletes came up with ideas to further their training while at sea. [[Discus throw|Discus]] champion [[James Duncan (athlete)|James Duncan]] had the ship's carpenter bore a hole in the middle of a discus, through which he attached a rope tied to the ship's rail. Duncan would then throw the discus out to sea, and then haul it back in by the rope.<ref name=Sull-39 /> [[Theodore Roosevelt Pell]], the only U.S. competitor in any of the [[Tennis at the 1912 Summer Olympics|tennis events]], set up a {{convert|10|ft|m|0|adj=on}} backstop on the [[aft]]er deck, practicing for hours each day.<ref name=Sull-41 />

''Finland'' arrived at Antwerp on the morning of [[24 June]] after a ten-day voyage over smooth seas. While the ship took on stores, the athletes completed their training at a local athletic club. Sailing at noon on [[26 June]], ''Finland'' reached Sweden four days later.<ref name=Hal-239 /> There were no injuries during the entirety of the voyage,<ref name=Sull-37 /> and, unlike the trip of the next American Olympic delegation in 1920<ref>The [[1916 Summer Olympics]], slated for [[Berlin]], were cancelled because of [[World War I]].</ref><U+2014>when the so-called "[[Mutiny of the Matoika|Mutiny of the ''Matoika'']]" took place<U+2014>no threats of a [[strike action|strike]] because of bad conditions aboard the ship.
.

== World War I ==
After her Olympic charter ended, ''Finland'' returned to her usual New York<U+2013>Antwerp route until the outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914.<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /> The Red Star liner, still sailing from New York, shifted to call at [[Liverpool]] beginning [[22 August]] for two roundtrips. Next moved to [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] service, ''Finland'' sailed from New York to [[Naples]] and [[Piraeus]] starting in November 1914. To comple her third and final circuit to the Mediterranean, she began her last voyage from Italy back to New York on [[24 March]] [[1915]].<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 />

By early May, ''Finland'' and sister ship ''Kroonland'' had both been chartered to the IMM subsidiary [[Panama Pacific Line]] for New York to San Francisco service via the [[Panama Canal]].<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /> The trips took about 17 days each way and called at either [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] or [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] on both eastbound and westbound trips.<ref>{{cite book | author = Panama Pacific Line | title = Panama Pacific Line Passenger List | date = [[1915-05-22]] | page = p. 2 }} Convenience copy of relevant page can be found [http://auctionwagon.s3.amazonaws.com/G2SM7101861a-f6f3-41d3-92d6-9779f30321ec-10585.jpg here]. Retrieved on [[2008-05-13]].</ref>

''Finland'' was next chartered to the [[American Line]], yet another IMM subsidiary, for service from New York to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[London]] beginning on [[26 October]]. After completing two circuits, the liner was returned to New York<U+2013>Liverpool service on [[19 January]] [[1916]].<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 /> At some point during this period, ''Finland'' was equipped with four {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, manned by members of the U.S. Navy's [[Naval Armed Guard]].

On [[18 December]] [[1916]], during an eastbound journey, ''Finland'' was halted by a French warship. According to Marjorie Crocker, an American woman headed for refugee work in Paris, the cruiser had fired a shot across the bow of ''Finland'', and then queried the officers of the liner. After allowing ''Finland'' to go on her way, the French ship circled around several times, then headed off first in one direction and then another, as if, according to Crocker, it were searching for something.<ref>Root and Crocker, p. 42<U+2013>43.</ref>

[[Image:King George V inspects American ship Finland in Liverpool.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] (center foreground, with beard) inspects gun crews aboard ''Finland'' in [[Liverpool]].]]
''Finland'' was still in New York<U+2013>Liverpool service when the United States declared war on the [[German Empire]] in April 1917. The United States Army, needing transports to get its men and materiel to [[France]], had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping. On [[28 May]], the committee selected ''Finland'' and thirteen other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough coal in their [[:wikt:bunker|bunker]]s for [[transatlantic]] crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea.<ref><!-- 28 May date-->Sharpe, p. 359.</ref><ref><!-- committee, qualities of ships -->Crowell and Wilson, p. 313<U+2013>14.</ref> After ''Finland'' discharged her last load of passengers, she was officially handed over to the Army at noon on [[2 June]], the last of the fourteen ships acquired.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 315<U+2013>16.</ref>

=== U.S. Army service ===
Before any troop transportation could be undertaken, all of the ships had to be hastily refitted<U+2014>in two weeks in the case of ''Finland''. Of the fourteen ships, ten, including ''Finland'', were designated to carry human passengers; the other four were designated as animal ships. The ten ships designated to carry troops had to have all of their second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities had to be greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard. ''Finland'', uniquely among the fourteen ships, already carried guns and did not need to be refitted for them.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 316.</ref> All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, [[quartermaster]]s, [[signalman|signalmen]], and [[radio|wireless]] operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.<ref>Gleaves, p. 102</ref>

The American convoy carrying the AEF was broken into four groups;<ref>The individual groups of the first convoy were typically counted as separate convoys in post-war sources. See, for example, Crowell and Wilson, Appendix G, p. 603.</ref> ''Finland'' was in the third group with {{USAT|San Jacinto||2}} and {{USAT|Henry R. Mallory||2}},<ref>{{USAT|Henry R.

Mallory'' and ''Mallory''.</ref> and escorts consisting of [[cruiser]] {{USS|Charleston|C-22|2}}, armed [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] {{USS|Cyclops|AC-4|2}}, and [[destroyer]]s {{USS|Allen|DD-66|2}}, {{USS|Preston|DD-19|2}}, and {{USS|McCall|DD-28|2}}.<ref>Gleaves, p. 38.</ref> The headquarters detachment and six [[company (military unit)|companies]] (of a total of 12) of the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]] embarked on ''Finland'' at New York.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 23<U+2013>24.</ref> The ship, under the command of U.S. Navy [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Stephen Victor Graham|S.

After returning to the United States, ''Finland''<U+2009><nowiki>'</nowiki>s next convoy crossing began on [[6 August]] in the company of {{USS|Henderson|AP-1|2}}, {{USAT|Antilles||2}}, and ''San Jacinto'', all escorted by cruiser {{USS|Montana|ACR-13|2}}.<ref name=C&W-603>Crowell and Wilson, p. 603.</ref> ''Finland'', carrying some of the troops that had tried to depart on [[30 August]] on {{USAT|Saratoga||2}} before she sank near [[Staten Island]],<ref>Benson, p. 221.</ref> had an uneventful roundtrip.<ref name=C&W-603 /> ''Finland'' next sailed on [[24 September]] as part of the 8th&nbsp;convoy with ''Henderson'', ''Antilles'', and {{USAT|Lenape||2}}, escorted by cruiser {{USS|San Diego|ACR-6|2}}.<ref name=C&W-603 /> According to Crowell and Wilson, the 8th group was "destined to misfortune". Three days out from New York, ''Lenape'' developed engine trouble and was compelled to return to port, but the rest of the convoy proceeded on and arrived in France on [[7 October]].<ref>Gleaves, p. 102.</ref> ''Henderson'' was the only ship to return to the United States without incident.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 428.</ref> On [[17 October]], ''Antilles'' was torpedoed by [[Unterseeboot 105|''U-105'']],<ref>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/359.html | title = Ships hit during WWI: Antilles | work = The U-boat War | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 2008-05-09 }}</ref> sinking in 6<U+00BD>&nbsp;minutes with the loss of 67 out of the 234 men on board.<ref>Gleaves, p. 106.</ref>

''Finland'' began her return journey to the United States on [[28 October]] in an {{convert|11|kn|km/h|adj=on}} convoy with cargo ships ''Buford'' and ''City of Savannah'' and escorted by [[armed yacht]]s {{USS|Alcedo|SP-166|2}}, {{USS|Corsair|SP-159|2}}, and {{USS|Wakiva II|SP-160|2}}, and destroyers {{USS|Smith|DD-17|2}}, {{USS|Lamson|DD-18|2}}, {{USS|Preston|DD-19|2}}, and {{USS|Flusser|DD-20|2}}.<ref name=G-108-110>Gleaves, p. 108<U+2013>110.</ref> ''Finland'', reurning most of the survivors of ''Antilles'' back to the U.S., was struck on her [[starboard]] side by a torpedo from [[Unterseeboot 93 (1917)|''U-93'']] at 09:27, {{convert|150|nmi|km}} from the French coast.<ref name=G-108-110/><ref><!-- uboat number, distance -->{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/2179.html | title = Ships hit during WWI: Finland | work = The U-boat War | publisher = Uboat.net | date =  | accessdate = 2008-05-09 }}</ref> Many of the civilian crew and the survivors of ''Antilles'', experiencing a torpedo attack for the second time in 11&nbsp;days, panicked. Lifeboats were immediately launched without word from Commander Graham, and the engine room and fire room men all left their stations, contrary to orders. The naval officers, armed with a [[revolver]] and a wooden mallet, were able to get the men back to their stations. The damage was limited to one [[cargo hold]] and had not affected the boilers or the engines. Although ''Finland'' took a starboard [[List (watercraft)|list]], it did not increase and Graham was able to steer a course back to Brest, anchoring there the next morning. Men aboard the prematurely launched lifeboats were rounded up by ''Wakiva II'' and ''Alcedo'' and returned to Brest.<ref name=G-108-110/> Nine men,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/sh-usn/usnsh-f/id4543.htm | title = USS ''Finland'' (ID # 4543), 1918-1919 | work = Online Library of Selected Images: U.S. Navy ships | publisher = [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]], [[Naval Historical Center]] | date = [[2008-03-07]] | accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}</ref> including three of the Naval Armed Guard detachment,<ref name=Officers>Bureau of Naval Personnel, ''Officers and Enlisted Men<U+2026>'', pp. 354, 359, 369.</ref> perished in the attack.

In the aftermath of the torpedoing incident, Commander Graham was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] for his "exceptionally meritorious service" in getting ''Finland'' safely back to port.<ref>Stringer, p. 26.</ref> [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade|Lieutenant (junior grade)]] Huntington English, from ''Wakiva II'', received the [[Navy Cross]], in part because he rescued of a soldier who had jumped from the torpedoed transport.<ref>Stringer, p. 67.</ref> [[Boatswain's Mate (US Navy)|Chief Boatswain's Mate]] John P. Doyle, on ''Alcedo'', was issued a [[Letter of Commendation]] for commanding a [[whaleboat]] that pulled a number of men from ''Finland'' from the water.<ref>Stringer, p. 192.</ref>

The deportment of the crew aboard ''Finland'', as well as that of ''Antilles'', while under attack demonstrated the problems with civilian-manned vessels. The Navy, led by the recommendations of [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Albert Gleaves]], insisted that all troop transports be manned entirely by Navy personnel. This was accomplished soon after so as to avoid the need for what Gleaves called "ignorant and unreliable men" who were "the sweepings of the docks".<ref name=G-108-110/>

''Finland'' was sufficiently repaired over the next two months and sailed for return to the United States on [[5 January]] [[1918]].<ref name=C&W-603 /> Ready again for convoy duty the next month, she sailed from New York on [[10 February]] with {{USS|Antigone|ID-3007|2}}, {{USS|Martha Washington|ID-3019|2}}, {{USS|President Lincoln|1907|2}}, and {{USS|Von Steuben|ID-3017|2}} under escort of the cruiser {{USS|Pueblo|CA-7|2}}.<ref name=C&W-605>Crowell and Wilson, p. 605.</ref> After safely reaching Saint-Nazaire, ''Finland'' discharged her passengers and cargo that included {{convert|13910|lb|kg}} of frozen beef for the AEF.<ref>[[United States Army Quartermaster Corps]], ''Cold Storage Branch'', p. 35.</ref> On [[27 February]], one day after departing, {{nowrap|''Finland''&#x2009;<nowiki>'</nowiki>s}} steering gear jammed, forcing her into the path of ''Henderson''. That ship was able to maneuver such that ''Finland'' only dealt her a glancing blow. ''Finland'' suffered only superficial damage; ''Henderson'' was holed below the waterline, but her crew took advantage of unusually calm February seas to repair the damage, and were soon able to proceed to New York.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 431.</ref> ''Finland'' and ''President Lincoln'' arrived back at New York on [[16 March]].<ref name=C&W-605 />

''Finland'' made one more crossing under Army charter. Leaving New York on [[23 March]], she convoyed with {{USS|Powhatan|ID-3013|2}}, {{USS|El Occidente|ID-3307|2}}, ''Martha Washington'', and cruiser ''Pueblo'', arriving in France on [[4 April]].

=== U.S. Navy service ===
''Finland'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[26 April]] with [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] W. J. Giles in command.<ref name=DANFS-fin /> The transport's move from Army to Navy control little changed her routine. Four days after her Navy commissioning, ''Finland'' departed New York with {{USS|Matsonia|ID-1589|2}}, {{USS|Manchuria|1633|2}}, and ''Kroonland''. Rendezvousing with the convoy were two transports sailing from [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Virginia]], ''Martha Washington'' and ''Powhatan''. {{USS|South Dakota|ACR-9|2}} provided the convoy with protection until its arrival in France on [[12 May]].

In the company of ''Kroonland'' and Italian steamer {{SS|Taormina|1908|2}}, she met up with {{USS|Pocahontas|ID-3044|2}}, {{USS|Susquehanna|ID-3016|2}}, and the Italian steamers {{SS|Duc d'Aosta||2}} and {{SS|Caserta||2}} from Newport News.<ref name=C&W-614>Crowell and Wilson, p. 614.</ref> Cruisers ''Pueblo'', {{USS|Huntington|CA-5|2}}, and destroyers {{USS|Rathburne|DD-113|2}} and {{USS|Colhoun|DD-85|2}} ushered the transports to France, where they arrived on [[7 August]].<ref>Crowell and Wilson (p. 614) list the destroyer as "''Calhoun''". The only {{USS|Calhoun|1851|6}} ever was a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] steamer captured during the [[American Civil War]].</ref> ''Finland'' arrived back in the United States on [[25 August]].<ref name=C&W-614 />

After embarking 3,678 troops,<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 559.</ref>  ''Finland'' departed again on [[15 September]] sailing with ''Henderson'', ''Martha Washington'', ''Pocahontas'', {{USS|Calamares|ID-3662|2}}, ''Powhatan'', and steamer ''Ulua''. ''Finland''<U+2009><nowiki>'</nowiki>s New York group met up with a Virginia group of Navy transports {{USS|Aeolus|ID-3005|2}} and {{USS|Koningen der Nederlanden|ID-2708|2}}, and steamers {{SS|Patria||2}} and {{SS|Kursk||2}}. Escorts {{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|2}}, ''Pueblo'', {{USS|St. Louis|C-20|2}}, {{USS|Stribling|DD-96|2}}, {{USS|Stringham|DD-83|2}}, and {{USS|Hopkins|DD-6|2}} helped to ensure the safe arrival of all ships in France on [[28 September]]. ''Martha Washington'' and ''Pocahontas'' accompanied ''Finland'' on her return journey and arrived at New York on [[12 October]].<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 617.</ref> 

''Finland'' began one last transatlantic crossing before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|Armistice]]. She left New York with [[hospital ship]] {{USS|Mercy|AH-4|2}} and steamers {{SS|Lutetia||2}}, {{SS|Czaritza||2}} and {{SS|Armaugh||2}} with battleship {{USS|Georgia|BB-15|2}} on [[4 November]] and arrived in France on [[15 November]], four days after the end of hostilities.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 620.</ref> In all, ''Finland'' transported 12,654 troops to France on her five Navy crossings.<ref name=Gleaves-246-47>Gleaves, p. 246<U+2013>47.</ref>

As the flow of troops was reversed to bring American troops home, ''Finland'' made 8 round trips from Europe to the United States, returning 32,197&nbsp;personnel to the United States.<ref name=Gleaves-246-47 /> On [[4 September]] [[1919]] she was transferred to the [[3d Naval District]] and on [[15 November]] decommissioned and delivered to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]],<ref name=DANFS-fin /> and, eventually, to the Red Star Line.<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 />

== Postwar career ==
After a refurbishment that outfitted her for 242&nbsp;first-class, 310&nbsp;second-class, and 876&nbsp;third-class passengers, ''Finland'' resumed her civilian career in April 1920. The liner, sailing opposite her sister ship ''Kroonland'', returned to her original route when she departed Antwerp on [[28 April]] for [[Southampton]] and New York. The two ships remained on that route until chartered to the American Line in mid-1923. After both ships were converted to cabin- and third-class passengers only, they sailed on the New York<U+2013>Plymouth<U+2013>Cherbourg<U+2013>[[Hamburg]] route from June to September. On [[29 September]], ''Finland'' resumed New York<U+2013>San Francisco service for the Panama Pacific Line; ''Kroonland'' once again joined her sister ship the following month. When {{SS|California|1928|2}}, and {{SS|Virginia|1928|2}} joined the Panama Pacific fleet in 1928, ''Finland'' and ''Kroonland'' were no longer needed and were both scrapped; ''Finland'' at [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]], and ''Kroonland'' at [[Genoa]].<ref name=Bonsor-2-856 />
