'''Strovilia''' ({{lang-tr|Akyar}}) is a small [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] village located at the border of the ''de facto'' [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC) with the British [[Sovereign Base Areas|Sovereign Base Area]] (SBA) of [[Dhekelia]]. It is the site of a [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|Green Line]] crossing.

The Cyprus UN buffer zone boundaries are defined as the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus#Turkish second invasion- 14-16 August 1974|cease fire lines of 16 August 1974]].  The Turkish forces, believing Strovilia to be within the area assigned to the SBA, did not occupy it by the time the cease fire came into effect.  

During the following twenty-six years, until its absorption into the TRNC on 30 June 2000, Strovilia remained as the sole location on the island where the Greek-Cypriot south shared a direct border with the Turkish-Cypriot north.  It was considered a small fragment, rather than an [[enclave]], since it bordered on two entities, the TRNC and the SBA.

On 14 December 2011, [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) adopted the resolution renewing the [[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus]] (UNFICYP) and calling for the restoration in Strovilia of "the military status quo which existed prior to 30 June 2000<U+201D>.<ref>[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/un/un-renews-unficyp-mandate/20111215 "UN renews UNFICYP mandate" (''Cyprus Mail'', 15 December 2011, page 1)]</ref>
