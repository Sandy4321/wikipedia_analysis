'''Beholder''' (foaled 2 February 2011) is an American [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]]. As a two-year-old in 2012 she won three of her five races including the [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies]] and was voted [[American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly]]. In the following season she won the [[Las Virgenes Stakes]], [[Santa Anita Oaks]], [[Zenyatta Stakes]] and [[Breeders' Cup Distaff]].  With that win, she became the first filly to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2013/nov/01/breeders-cup-distaff-/ |title=Beholder romps in $2 million BC Distaff |publisher=UTSanDiego.com |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-06}}</ref>

==Background==
Beholder is a bay filly with no white [[Horse markings|markings]] bred by the Clarkland Farm in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. She is probably the best horse sired by Henny Hughes, a sprinter whose biggest wins came in the [[King's Bishop Stakes]] and [[Vosburgh Stakes]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/stallionbook/stallion.sd?popup=1&horse_id=641932 |title=Henny Hughes Stud Record |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> Beholder's dam, Leslie's Lady, was a descendant of the broodmare Last Bird, making her a distant relative of the [[Kentucky Derby]] winner [[I'll Have Another]].<ref name="bloodlines1">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family23b.htm |title=Thoroughbred Bloodlines - Turk Mare - Family 23-b |publisher=Bloodlines.net |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>

As a yearling, Beholder was consigned by the Clarkland Farm to the sales at [[Keeneland]] in September, where she was bought for $180,000 by [[Spendthrift Farm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodstock.racingpost.com/sales/results/individual_home.sd?tab=&st=8&l=&i=1&ob=ln&od=ASC&page=1&fv=131072&df=2011-09-11&dt=2011-09-15&venue_id=6&hn=&s=&a=&sin=&dn=Leslie_s+Lady&sdn=&vn=&b=&mip=&map=&lm=#individualResultsTabs=catalogue_6 |title=Keeneland Associaton September 2011 Yearling Sale |publisher=Bloodstock.racingpost.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> The filly was sent into training with the Californian trainer Richard Mandella.

==Racing career==

===2012: two-year-old season===
Beholder was ridden in all her races as a two-year-old by [[Garrett Gomez]]. She began her racing career by finishing fourth behind Executiveprivilege in a [[maiden race]] on the [[Synthetic racetrack surfaces for horse racing|Cushion Track]] at [[Hollywood Park Racetrack]] on June 28. A month later she recorded her first win in a maiden race at [[Del Mar racetrack]], beating Fanticola by three and a quarter [[Horse length|lengths]]. On September 2 she was moved up to [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] class for the [[Del Mar Debutante Stakes]] over seven furlongs. Starting at odds of 8.1/1 she led from the start and broke clear of the field in the straight but was caught on the line and beaten a nose by Executiveprivilege.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/horses/result_home.sd?race_id=563380&r_date=2012-09-02&popup=yes#results_top_tabs=re_&results_bottom_tabs=ANALYSIS |title=Del Mar Debutante Stakes result |publisher=[[Racing Post]] |date=2 September 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> Beholder moved to [[Santa Anita Park]] in October and won a six furlong allowance race by eleven lengths despite being eased down in the closing stages. On November 2 at Santa Anita, Beholder was one of eight fillies to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies over one mile. She started the 9/2 joint second choice in the betting behind Executiveprivilege, who was made the 13/8 favourite. Beholder took the lead from the start and broke clear of the field to open up a three length advantage on the final turn. She held off the late challenge of Executiveprivilege to win by a length.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mitchell |first=Eric |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/74145/spendthrifts-beholder-takes-juvenile-fillies |title=Spendthrift's Beholder Takes Juvenile Fillies |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>

===2013: three-year-old season===
Beholder began her three-year-old season in the Grade II [[Santa Ynez Stakes]] over seven furlongs at Santa Anita on January 21. She started the 1/5 favorite but was beaten three-quarters of a length by Renee's Titan. An explanation for her poor performance emerged a week later when an examination revealed an ulcer in the filly's throat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/75823/small-ulcer-detected-in-beholders-throat |title=Small Ulcer Detected in Beholder's Throat |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> At the same course on March 2, Beholder started 4/5 favorite for the Grade I Las Virgenes Stakes over one mile. She led from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by three and three quarter lengths from [[Fiftyshadesofhay]]. Beholder's next race was the Grade I Santa Anita Oaks on April 6, for which she started the 3/10 favorite. Despite an unfavorable draw, she quickly went into the lead and went clear of the field in the straight to win by two and three quarter lengths from Iotapa. Mandella described the winner as having "the heart of a warrior".<ref>{{cite web|last=Shulman |first=Lenny |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/77360/beholder-punches-ticket-to-kentucky-oaks |title=Beholder Punches Ticket to Kentucky Oaks |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> In the [[Kentucky Oaks]] on May 3 at [[Churchill Downs]], Beholder started at odds of 9/1 in a field of ten fillies, with the [[Gulfstream Oaks]] winner [[Dreaming of Julia]] being made the 6/4 favorite. Beholder tracked the leader Midnight Lucky before moving into the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages by the 39/1 outsider [[Princess of Sylmar]] and finished second, beaten half a length. Throughout her spring campaign, she continued to be ridden by Gomez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&refno=8884841&registry=T |title=Horse Profile: Beholder |publisher=Equibase.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>

After a break of almost four months, Beholder returned in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, in which she was ridden for the first time by the veteran [[Gary Stevens (jockey)|Gary Stevens]]. She started the 1/10 favorite and led all the way, winning easily from Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, Beholder was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start as usual and won easily from the six-year-old mare Authenticity. Mandella called the winner "a filly that really likes the fight" while Stevens said that "I haven't gotten close to the bottom of her yet".<ref>{{cite web|last=Shulman |first=Lenny |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/80964/beholder-dominates-foes-in-zenyatta-stakes |title=Beholder Dominates Foes in Zenyatta Stakes |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date=September 28, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref> On November 1, Beholder contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field was a very strong one, including [[Royal Delta]] who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity and [[Close Hatches]]. Beholder tracked the leaders before moving up into second place behind Authenticity half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field in the straight to win easily by four and a quarter lengths from Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race Mandella said "I<U+2019>ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in my years of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all".<ref>{{cite web|last=Shinar |first=Jack |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/81786/beholder-trumps-delta-princess-in-distaff |title=Beholder Trumps Delta, Princess in Distaff |publisher=BloodHorse.com |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>
