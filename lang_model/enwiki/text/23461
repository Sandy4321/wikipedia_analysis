===Marvel Comics===
The role played by the young Spike in the animated series was filled in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel comic]] book series by his younger brother, Buster, exclusive to that continuity. Indeed, Buster was fully intended to exist in ''place'' of Spike for the comic book series, until the release of the Fortress Maximus toy in 1987, which included Spike as a Headmaster partner, hence necessitating the hurried introduction of Spike into the comic book continuity.

Returning home from college to discover that his father's garage had been destroyed, Spike investigated the Autobots' deserted base at Mount Saint Hillary, learning that Buster had been captured by the Earth-based Decepticons. While there, he encountered a group of new Autobots, led by Fortress Maximus, who had just arrived from the planet Nebulos, and in a subsequent attack by [[Scorponok]]'s group of Decepticons, Fortress Maximus's Nebulon partner, [[Galen Kord]], was killed in a rockfall. Before dying, he gave his control helmet to Spike, allowing the boy to control Fortress Maximus in battle and force the Decepticons to retreat. In the aftermath of the battle, Spike accepted the Autobots' offer to be fully [[binary-bonded]] to Fortress Maximus as his new Headmaster partner in order to save Buster from the Decepticons.

As Fortress Maximus, Spike led the attack on the Decepticons' island base, defeating Shockwave in an outer space battle, but failing to rescue Buster, and turning to the other Earth-based Autobots for help. Acting commander [[Grimlock]] refused, disgusted at the thought of a human leading the Autobots, but relented when he saw the rationality of the act during a massive Decepticon attack on the Autobot forces. With the deceased [[Optimus Prime]] subsequently restored to life as a [[Powermaster]], Spike rescued Buster from the Decepticons amidst the chaos caused by [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]]'s attempt to gain the power of the [[Underbase]].

Following that clash, Spike, having accomplished what he set out to do, attempted to abandon his Autobot life, and return to living a normal human lifestyle. Unfortunately, his connection with Fortress Maximus proved to be far deeper than anyone knew when he was attacked by the Decepticon Pretender Beasts, Snarler and [[Carnivac]], and discovered that Maximus's mind actually continued to exist within his own. Despite recombining with Maximus to defeat the Decepticons, Spike again returned Maximus's body and his exo-suit to the Autobots, and succeeded for a short time in living a normal life, until he found himself drawn to the crash of [[Ark (Transformers)|the Ark]] in [[Canada]] in 1991. Merging with Fortress Maximus again, he defeated the maddened [[Galvatron]], and some time thereafter, gave up his life to stop the plans of [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] by sacrificing himself to destroy the Ark.

The post-movie Spike appears in the story "Time Wars", persuading [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]] to delay his journey back in time long enough to halt an attack on a human settlement by the [[Terrorcons]]. (Due to the temporal disruption later in this story, it is possible this future was later erased from the timeline.)

Spike is also present in the alternate 2009 seen in "Rhythms of Darkness", working with the handful of surviving Autobots led by [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]]. He was accompanied by an apparently African-American woman named Lisa, with whom he shared a mutual but unrequited attraction. Spike participated in what everyone involved expected to be a suicide attack on the Decepticon fortress city, attaching the US flag to its summit to demonstrate to the rest of the world, who were about to launch a nuclear strike on the area, that the American population was still fighting. After [[Galvatron]] was forcibly removed from that timeline, he presumably went on to rejoin the Autobots in their battle against the remaining Decepticons.

===Animated series===
The most famous of all the Autobots' human allies, Spike Witwicky was fourteen years old, aiding his father, Sparkplug, in his work on an offshore [[oil platform|oil rig]] when the Transformers entered his life in 1984. A [[Decepticon]] attack on the rig left Spike and Sparkplug in peril where they were rescued by [[Optimus Prime (Transformers)|Optimus Prime]]. Afterward, they offered their friendship and aid to the Autobots, teaching them about the ways of Earth. Spike had a lot to learn about the robots in disguise, however, as one of his first actions saw him unwittingly bring the disguised [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] into Autobot Headquarters. He later aided [[Hound (Transformers)|Hound]] in battle against [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]]. When the Autobots were planning to return to their home planet of [[Cybertron]], he intended to go with them.

However, that was not to be as the re-emergence of the undefeated Decepticons kept the Autobots on Earth, protecting it and its inhabitants from their enemies. Spike proved an invaluable source of information for the Autobots, teaching them about subjects such as [[dinosaur]]s and various Earthly sports. He also joined them on journeys to such fantastic locales as Cybertron, [[Dinobot Island]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[England]]. However, he underwent his own share of troubles, occasionally being captured by the Decepticons for various reasons, and suffering the torture of seeing his own brainwashed father under Decepticon control. On another occasion he received [[brain damage]] in a Decepticon attack. To save his life, his mind was transferred to a Transformer body called Autobot X created by his father while his body healed. Unfortunately, the process drove Spike into thinking he was a "[[Frankenstein]] [[monster]]", and he sided with the Decepticons in an attack on the Autobots. However, he saw the truth after nearly killing his own father with Megatron in gun mode. He turned Megatron's firepower on the other Decepticons, and eventually his mind was put back in his own body. Spike formed a fast friendship with the young Autobot, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], and the two often adventured and traveled together.

In one particular adventure in 1985, when he was fifteen years old, Spike met a girl named Carly. He immediately took a liking to her, although Carly was more interested in getting to meet the Autobots at first. As time went on, Carly developed an attraction to Spike and through adventures together, including a solo mission to Cybertron, it blossomed into a romance.

In the episode "A Decepticon Raider in King Arthur's Court" [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]], [[Hoist (Transformers)|Hoist]] and Spike were battling [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]], [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], [[Rumble (Transformers)|Rumble]] and [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] in England. Low on power, the Autobots and Decepticons discovered a magical stone formation called the Dragon Mound and were transported back to the year 543. Although Starscream attempted to take over a castle and build a new empire with himself as lord, the help of local knights and a wizard refueled the Autobots, who defeated the Decepticons. After defeating a dragon who nested in the Dragon Mound the Autobots and Decepticons and returned to their own time where they rejoined the fight in modern day England. 

As they entered their twenties, Spike and Carly were married, and in 1993, Carly gave birth to a son, Daniel. As Spike himself grew older, his experience and closeness to the Autobots saw him appointed Earth's official ambassador to Cybertron, but as the Autobots pressed their attack to reclaim Cybertron from the Decepticons in 2005, the 35-year-old Spike was stationed on Moonbase Two, which was attacked and consumed by the planet-eater, [[Unicron]]. Wearing a transforming "exo-suit" battle armor, Daniel rescued his father before Unicron was destroyed.

Although Spike was generally limited to performing more diplomatic duties throughout 2006, he was pivotal in the initial defeat of the invading [[Quintessons]], destroying the mechanism that the aliens had used to immobilize all Transformers and freeing them. In 2007, Spike was among the Transformers and humans blasted to the planet Nebulos by the energies of the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]], where he performed the process that bonded some Autobots with a group of Nebulan rebels to form the [[Headmasters (Transformers)|Headmasters]]. Later, Spike became a Headmaster, merging with the pacifist Autobot, [[Cerebros]], who in turn combined with a giant Transformer body Spike had created, forming [[Fortress Maximus]]. With the power of Fortress Maximus, Spike rescued Daniel from the clutches of the Decepticons, and was in the process able to reroute the destructive energy created by the opening of the Plasma Energy Chamber to revitalize Cybertron, creating a new Golden Age.

Across the [[Pacific Ocean]], in Japan, however, the events of 2007 were stricken, and replaced with a full-length new series, titled ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]''. Due to the different concept for Headmasters in Japan, which did not incorporate Nebulans or humans, Spike was not a component of Fortress Maximus in this series, but still played an important role in Cybertron/Earth relations. At one point, so desperate for peace, Spike even arranged negotiations between himself and [[Galvatron]], in hopes of developing a joint energy-production program <U+2014> hopes which were soon dashed.

===Books===
Spike was featured in the 1985 [[Find Your Fate]] Junior book called ''[[Battle Drive]]'' by [[Barbara Siegel]] and [[Scott Siegel]].<ref name="gamebooks.org">http://www.gamebooks.org/fyf_tran.htm</ref>

Spike was featured in the 1985 Transformers audio book ''[[List of Transformers books#Autobots.27 Lightning Strike|Autobots' Lightning Strike]]''. In this book, he was said to be an engineering student. He also featured in ''[[List of Transformers books#Megatron's Fight For Power|Megatron's Fight For Power]]'', ''Autobots Fight Back'', ''Laserbeak's Fury'', ''Galvatron's Air Attack'' and ''Decepticon Hideout''.<ref>{{cite book| isbn=0721409423|last=Grant|first=John|title=Autobots Fight Back|publisher=Ladybird Books| year=1985}}</ref>

===Manga===
In the Japanese manga "Big War" #2 the Autobots [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]], [[Grimlock]], [[Kup]] and [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]], along with their human allies Spike Witwicky and Daniel Witwicky send [[Computron (Transformers)|Computron]] into battle against [[Galvatron]]'s new warrior combiner [[Abominus]]. The Terrorcons spit "corrosive control liquid" against Computron, taking control of him and turning him into a Decepticon. Spike luckily uses his new Exosuit to free Computron with "defense spray." Defeated, Galvatron retreats.

===Dreamwave Productions===
[[image:Spike Witwicky in Dreamwave comics.jpg|right|thumb|Spike Witwicky as an Autobot Headmaster partner in Dreamwave comics.]]
In the 21st Century re-imagining of the G1 universe by [[Dreamwave Productions]], Spike was given a fragment of the [[Matrix of Leadership|Matrix]] by Optimus Prime when the Autobots departed Earth in 1999, having finally captured the Decepticons and intending to return them to Cybertron. They did not get that far, as an explosion tore their craft, the Ark II, apart shortly after it left Earth's atmosphere, leaving the Transformers, and the small human crew - including Spike's father - believed dead.

However, in 2002, Spike - now married to Carly and fathering Daniel - found that this was not the case when he was approached by General Hallo of the American military. A terrorist, Adam Rook, had recovered several of the inactive (but functional) Transformers and brought them under his control, intending to sell them on the black market as weapons of mass destruction; in order to stop him, the military had recovered a Transformer of their own. That Transformer was Optimus Prime, whom Spike was able to reactivate by replacing the Matrix fragment. Unfortunately, Spike soon discovered that Hallo was part of an even more insane scheme, having originally worked with Rook in developing the Transformer-controlling program, and being double-crossed by him. Confronting Hallo just as he launched a nuclear missile at [[San Francisco]], Spike took his life in his hands and nearly met his end, until Hallo was gunned down by military agents.

In the ''More Than Meets the Eye'' character profile series, it is shown Dreamwave intended to eventually have Spike become a Headmaster partner for [[Fortress Maximus]]. However, unlike other similar entries in the MTMTE series, no information was given about Spike at all leaving many readers with more questions than answers. But with Dreamwave shutting down, this storyline may never come to be.

===Toys===
*'''''Generation 1'' Fortress Maximus with Cerebros and Spike''' (1987)
:The largest Transformers toy from Generation 1, Fortress Maximus has multiple altmode configurations. He transforms into a compact "city" mode, and can also assume a secondary mode described in the US instruction as a "battle station." This mode was rebranded as a starship for the Japanese instructions, and is the "default" mode for Fort Max in the Headmasters animated series. Additionally, the 1987 Hasbro toy catalog features a mis-transformed Fortress Maximus in a mode referred to as an "impenetrable fortress," essentially consisting of his city mode with the legs splayed outwards.
:In all modes, Maximus has a wide array of pop-out (non-firing) guns and gimmicks. Its left leg hides a small prison cell, plus has a swing-out cannon/helipad. Its right leg has a small storage compartment. Its torso has a gear-activated spinner for the detachable radar array accessory, a "control socket" for Cerebros' "communications tower" mode, and a working elevator that can lift small toys up to its central ramp to be launched in its alternate modes. (The crank for this elevator ends up in a very unfortunate position in robot mode.) Each arm had a long ramp on the back with sliding launchers for small vehicles.
:Its robot-mode head is formed by Cerebros, who does not actually need Spike to attach to the upper body. It came with both Headmaster units, plus the Gasket and Grommet mini-vehicles.
:The Japanese release of Fortress Maximus came with a pair of swords; one for Fortress, a large one for Maximus. It is currently unknown if the swords were originally planned for the Hasbro version but dropped for price or safety concerns, or if they were a Takara-initiated addition to their release of the toy.
:During its time of release, Fortress Maximus retailed at $89.99, making him the most expensive ''Transformers'' toy in the U.S. market (a record that wasn't met or broken for nearly two decades, until the release of 20th Anniversary DVD Edition [[Optimus Prime]] and Ultimate [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]). Maximus was also the third most expensive toy Hasbro produced at the time (behind the ''[[USS Flagg]]'' and ''[[Defiant (G.I. Joe)|Defiant]]'' Space Shuttle Complex from the ''[[G.I. Joe]]'' series).
:This toy was designed by Koujin Ohno, and is filed under U.S. patent D305,786.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPATD305786 Google Patents]</ref>
*'''''Dark of the Moon'' Human Alliance Basic Backfire with Spike Witwicky''' (not yet released)
:A new 2-inch figurine of Spike is included with the Autobot Backfire as part of the Human Alliance line. Backfire transforms from a [[All-terrain vehicle#Three-wheelers|three-wheeled ATV]] to robot or a larger Mech Tech blaster that can be used with Voyager of Leader Class figures.<ref>[http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/dotm-human-alliance-autobots-487/backfire-with-spike-witwicky-5492/ TFW2005.com - Backfire with Spike Witwicky]</ref>

In the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' episode "Garbage In, Garbage Out", a man who looked very much like Spike was trying to get a blond-haired girl to the hospital as she was in labor. The woman referred to him as "Spike". At BotCon 2008, it was confirmed that this was indeed intended to be Spike and Carlee (with Corey Burton reprising his role as Spike, specifically the adult post-movie Spike), and since Daniel had already been seen in the series too, Carlee was in labor with her second child.

===Animated series===
In Jasper, [[Nevada]], three young humans, Jack Darby, Miko Nakadai, and Rafael Esquivel, are accidentally caught in the crossfire in a fight between enormous robots that transform into vehicles.

While this is going on, Megatron returns from a three-year-long exile in deep space, bringing with him Dark Energon, a substance able to revive dead Transformers as mindless zombies, and sets out to raise a vast army of the undead and conquer the galaxy. In the final episode, Megatron is seen in front of the Space Bridge waiting for his army of the undead to come through it; however, the Space Bridge explodes, and Megatron is seen no more.
