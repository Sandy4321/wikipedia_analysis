'''Mindaugas''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>m<U+0131>ndo<U+028A>g<U+028C>s}}, ca. 1200 <U+2013> 12 September 1263) was the first known [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] and the only [[King of Lithuania]]. Little is known of his origins, early life, or rise to power; he is mentioned in a 1219 treaty as an elder duke, and in 1236 as the leader of all the Lithuanians. The contemporary and modern sources discussing his ascent mention strategic marriages along with banishment or murder of his rivals. He extended his domain into regions southeast of [[Lithuania proper]] during the 1230s and 1240s. In 1250 or 1251, during the course of internal power struggles, he was baptised as a [[Roman Catholic]]; this action enabled him to establish an alliance with the [[Livonian Order]], a long-standing antagonist of the Lithuanians. During the summer of 1253 he was crowned [[King of Lithuania]], ruling between 300,000 and 400,000 subjects.<ref name=fru>{{cite book|first=Kevin |last=O'Connor|title=The History of the Baltic States |year=2003 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing]]| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&pg=PA14&as_brr=3#PPA15,M1 |page=15 |isbn=0313323550}}</ref> 

While his ten-year reign was marked by various state-building accomplishments, his conflicts with relatives and other dukes continued, and western Lithuania strongly resisted the alliance's rule. His gains in the southeast were challenged by the [[Tatars]]. He broke with the Livonian Order in 1261, possibly renouncing Christianity, and was assassinated in 1263 by his nephew [[Treniota]] and another rival, Duke [[Daumantas]]. His three immediate successors were assassinated as well. The disorder  was not resolved until [[Traidenis]] gained the title of Grand Duke ca. 1270. 

Although his reputation was unsettled during the following centuries and his descendants were not notable, he gained standing during the 19th and 20th centuries. Mindaugas was the only King of Lithuania;<ref name=leg/> while most of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes from [[Jogaila]] onward also reigned as [[King of Poland|Kings of Poland]], the titles remained separate. Now generally considered the founder of the [[Lithuania]]n state, he is also now credited with stopping the advance of the Tatars towards the Baltic Sea, establishing international recognition of Lithuania, and turning it towards Western civilization.<ref name=brit>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] | title=Mindaugas| year=2009| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/383615/Mindaugas|quote=Indeed, Mindaugas<U+2019> campaigns in the east checked a Mongol drive toward the Baltic.}}</ref><ref name=leg/><ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Tomas Baranauskas|first=Tomas |last=Baranauskas |title=Lietuvos valstyb<U+0117>s i<U+0161>takos |chapter=The Formation of the Lithuanian State| publisher=Vaga |year=2000  |chapterurl=http://viduramziu.istorija.net/en/state.htm |pages=245<U+2013>272 |accessdate=2009-02-20 |isbn=5-415-01495-0}}</ref>
In the 1990s the historian [[Edvardas Gudavi<U+010D>ius]] published research supporting an exact coronation date <U+2013> July 6, 1253. This day is now an official national holiday, [[Statehood Day (Lithuania)|Statehood Day]].

==Origins, family, and name==
{{main|House of Mindaugas}}
Because written sources covering the era are scarce, Mindaugas' origins and family tree have not been conclusively established. The [[Bychowiec Chronicle]]s, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, have been discredited in this regard, since they assert an ancestry from the [[Palemonids]], a noble family said to have originated within the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=ij>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last = Jonynas | first =Ignas | editor = [[Vaclovas Bir<U+017E>i<U+0161>ka]] | encyclopedia = Lietuvi<U+0161>koji enciklopedija | title = Bychovco kronika | year = 1935 | publisher = Spaudos Fondas | volume = III | location = Kaunas | pages = 875<U+2013>878}}</ref> His year of birth, sometimes given as ca. 1200, is at other times left as a question mark.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Stone|title=A History of East Central Europe|year=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&pg=PA3&dq=mindaugas+1200&as_brr=3&client=opera

He is thought to have had two sisters, one married to [[Vykintas]] and another to [[Daniel of Halych]]. Vykintas and his son [[Treniota]] played major roles in later power struggles. Mindaugas had at least two wives, [[Morta]] and Morta's sister, whose name is unknown, and possibly an earlier wife; her existence is presumed because two children <U+2013> a son named [[Vai<U+0161>vilkas]] and an unnamed daughter married to [[Svarn]] in 1255 <U+2013> were already leading independent lives when Morta's children were still young. In addition to Vai<U+0161>vilkas and his sister, two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, are mentioned in written sources. The latter two were assassinated along with Mindaugas. Information on his sons is limited and historians continue to discuss their number. He may have had two other sons whose names were later conflated by [[scribe]]s into Ruklys and Rupeikis.<ref name=kiaupa/>

In the 13th century Lithuania had little contact with foreign lands. Lithuanian names sounded obscure and unfamiliar to various chroniclers, who altered them to sound more like names in their native language.<ref name=ling>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Lietuvi<U+0173> enciklopedija | title=Mindaugas |first=Antanas |last=Salys | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=Lietuvi<U+0173> enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1953<U+2013>1966 |volume=XXVIII |pages=493<U+2013>495 |id={{LCC|55020366}} }}

==Path to coronation==

Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas formed a powerful coalition in opposition to Mindaugas, along with the [[Samogitia]]ns of western Lithuania, the Livonian Order, [[Daniel of Galicia]] (Tautvilas and Edivydas' brother-in-law), and Vasilko of [[Volhynia]].<ref name=LV/> The princes of Galicia and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, disrupting Vai<U+0161>vilkas' supremacy.

In 1250 or 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, in return for an acknowledgment by [[Pope Innocent IV]] as king. The Pope welcomed a Christian Lithuania as a bulwark against Mongol threats; in turn, Mindaugas sought papal intervention in the ongoing Lithuanian conflicts with the Christian orders.<ref name=middleages>{{cite book|first=Andre |last=Vauchez |coauthors=Richard Barrie Dobson, Adrian Walford, Michael Lapidge| title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages| year=2000|publisher=[[Routledge]]| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OSTvzR8FQlYC&pg=PA855&lr=&as_brr=3 |page=855 |isbn=1579582826}}</ref><ref name=el/> On July 17, 1251, the pope signed two crucial [[papal bull]]s.

The process of coronation and the establishment of Christian institutions would take two years.

Relative peace and stability prevailed for about eight years. Mindaugas used this opportunity to concentrate on the expansion to the east, and to establish and organize state institutions.

Immediately after his coronation, Mindaugas transferred some lands to the Livonian Order <U+2013> portions of [[Samogitia]], [[Nadruvians|Nadruva]], [[Selonia]], and [[Dainava]] <U+2014> although his control over these western lands was tenuous.<ref name=voruta /><ref name=endre/> There has been much discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255, 1257, and 1259) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order.

Mindaugas and his antagonist Daniel reached a reconciliation in 1255; the Black Ruthenian lands were transferred to [[Roman Danylovich|Roman]], Daniel's son.

A single sentence in the [[Hypatian Chronicle]] mentions Mindaugas defending himself in [[Voruta]] against his nephews and Duke Vykintis; two other sources mention "his castle". The location of Voruta is not specified, and this has led to considerable speculation, along with archeological research, concerning the seat of his court. Fourteen different locations have been proposed, including [[Kernav<U+0117>]] and Vilnius.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite book | title=Mindaugas |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavi<U+010D>ius |url=http://www.spauda.lt/voruta/about/mindaugas.htm |year=1998 | location=Vilnius | publisher=<U+017D>ara |isbn=9986-34-020-9}}</ref><ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite book |title=Lietuvos medin<U+0117>s pilys |first=Gintautas |last=Zabiela |year=1995 |publisher=Diemedis |location=Vilnius |isbn=9986-23-018-7 |page=175}}</ref> The ongoing formal archeological digs at Kernav<U+0117> began in 1979 after a portion of the site named "Mindaugas Throne hill-fort" collapsed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reserve <U+2013> Archaeological Site| publisher=Administration of the State Cultural Reserve of Kernav<U+0117>| url=http://www.kernave.org/archeo_en.htm| accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref> The town now hosts a major celebration on [[Statehood Day (Lithuania)|Statehood Day]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cultural life|url=http://www.lithuaniatourism.co.uk/index.php?id=421|publisher=Lithuanian National Tourism Office |accessdate=2009-02-04}}</ref>

The Livonian Order used their alliance with Mindaugas to gain control over Samogitian lands. In 1252 he approved the Order's construction of [[Klaipeda Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Gimpse on the History of Klaipeda Port|url=http://www.portofklaipeda.lt/en.php/port_of_klaipda/about_the_port/history/7737|publisher=Klaipeda State Seaport Authority|accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref> Their governance, however, was seen as oppressive. Local merchants could only conduct transactions via Order-approved intermediaries; inheritance laws were changed; and the choices among marriage partners and residencies were restricted.<ref name=lit1/> Several pitched battles ensued. In 1259 the Order lost the [[Battle of Skuodas]], and in 1260 it lost the [[Battle of Durbe]]. The first defeat encouraged a rebellion by the [[Semigalia]]ns, and the defeat at Durbe spurred the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] into the [[Great Prussian Rebellion]], which lasted for 14 years.<ref name=kiaupa /> Encouraged by these developments and by his nephew [[Treniota]], Mindaugas broke peace with the Order. The gains he had expected from Christianization had proven to be minor.<ref name=vytas>{{cite book|first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |coauthors=Judith B.

Mindaugas may have reverted to [[Lithuanian mythology|paganism]] afterwards.

Regional conflicts with the Order escalated.
