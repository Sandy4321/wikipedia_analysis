{{nihongo title|MissingNo.|<U+3051><U+3064><U+3070><U+3093>|Ketsuban}}, sometimes written as '''MissingNO''',<ref name="tech">{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/gameboy/trouble_specificgame.jsp#missingno |title=Customer Service - Specific GamePak Troubleshooting |accessdate=2009-06-07 |author=[[Nintendo]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hLPtFgU6 |archivedate=2009-06-07}}</ref> is the name of a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon#Collecting and playing|Pok<U+00E9>mon species]] found in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue]]''. Standing for "'''Missing Number'''" and described as a "programming quirk",<ref name="tech"/>  MissingNo. is used as an [[error handler]] by [[Game Freak]] to appear in the event of the game attempting to access data for a Pok<U+00E9>mon species that does not exist. Due to the manner by which two in-game [[Event (computing)|events]] were programmed, players could encounter the MissingNo. Pok<U+00E9>mon via a [[glitch]] by triggering the events one after the other.

First documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', encountering MissingNo. results in mostly temporary graphical errors and the mass duplication of the player's sixth item in their item menu, the latter effect resulting in player's guides and gaming magazines covering the glitch. MissingNo.'s appearance in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'' has been noted as one of the most famous glitches in video gaming by sources such as [[IGN]].<ref name="topten"/> Fans of the game series have attempted to rationalize MissingNo. as a full Pok<U+00E9>mon within the game's world, an aspect discussed in sociological studies regarding the impact of games upon society.

==History==
The ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' franchise, introduced in Japan in 1996, revolves around the concept of capturing and training various species of creatures called Pok<U+00E9>mon, and using them to battle other wild Pok<U+00E9>mon or those of other "[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainers]]", other human players or [[non-player characters]] within the game.<ref>{{cite manual |author = [[Game Freak]] |title = Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue, Instruction manual |publisher = [[Nintendo]]  |date =1998-09-30 |pages=6-7}}</ref> Pok<U+00E9>mon battle each other through the use of statistics such as Attack and Defense, and abilities learned through gaining [[experience points]] or taught to them by their trainer through the use of various items.<ref>{{cite manual |author = [[Game Freak]] |title = Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue, Instruction manual |publisher = [[Nintendo]]  |date =1998-09-30 |page=11}}</ref> These abilities can allow players to interact differently within the game's world as well, such as instantaneous travel instantly between two areas.<ref>{{cite video game| title = [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue]]| developer = [[Game Freak]]| publisher = [[Nintendo]]| date = September 30, 1998|quote=HM02 is FLY. It will take you back to any town.}}</ref>

The method of causing MissingNo. to appear was first documented by Nintendo in the May 1999 issue of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', with the magazine detailing the series of events necessary to cause the glitch to occur in response to a reader's query.<ref name="NP">{{cite journal |last=Staff |year=1999 |month=May |title=Pokechat |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |volume=120 |pages=101}}</ref> Cautioning that "any contact with it...could easily erase your game file or corrupt your graphics", they stated that in order to find it the player would have to see the Old Man's demonstration in the game's Viridian City, and then, using a Pok<U+00E9>mon with the "Fly" ability, travel to Cinnibar Island's location. From there, using a Pok<U+00E9>mon with the "Surf" ability to enter the water on the island's right side and travel up and down would eventually start a battle against a glitched character, MissingNo.<ref name="NP"/><ref name="why"/>

==Characteristics==
[[File:Missingno-ny.png|thumb|left|MissingNo.'s possible forms]]
The encounter with the MissingNo. Pok<U+00E9>mon occurs due to two events. When traveling from one area to another, the game assigns values for Pok<U+00E9>mon that the player encounters to a [[data buffer]], read by the game when they encounter a wild Pok<U+00E9>mon. However, on the right side of the Cinnibar and Seafoam Island locations, no data is assigned to this buffer, and the information from the previous area is used instead.<ref name="guide"/> The second event is the Old Man's demonstration. The player's name is temporarily stored into the buffer to be retrieved once the demonstration is over, however the buffer is not cleared afterwards. As a result the hexadecimal values assigned to each letter of the player's name are referenced for the wild Pok<U+00E9>mon the player can encounter on the coasts of Cinnibar and Seafoam island if no other areas are encountered beforehand. If the encounter value selected at random does not reference an existing Pok<U+00E9>mon, the game's error handling [[subroutine]] is triggered, and the player enters a battle against a Pok<U+00E9>mon named MissingNo.<ref name="why"/>

Once encountered, players can fight, flee, or capture MissingNo. like any other wild Pok<U+00E9>mon in the game.<ref name="unauthorized"/> Regardless of the outcome, after encountering the Pok<U+00E9>mon, the sixth item in the player's item menu will be increased from its current value to 128,<ref name="why"/> and the game's "Hall of Fame" gallery will become permanently glitched. Other graphical glitches may also occur,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/other-worlds-than-these-to-be-a-pokemon-master-131455.phtml |title=Other Worlds Than These: To be a Pokemon Master |publisher=Destructoid |autor=Staff |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref>  though are temporary and will be removed by viewing another Pok<U+00E9>mon<U+2019>s statistic screen or resetting the Game Boy. If captured, MissingNo. will be treated as a fully functional Pok<U+00E9>mon for the player to use, appearing in the game's [[Pok<U+00E9>dex|numerical index]] listing as number "000" and usable against wild Pok<U+00E9>mon or other Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainers. Each MissingNo. has consistent abilities, type (listed as "Normal/Bird"), statistics, and sounds. When viewed, it will commonly appear as a scrambled "d" shaped rectangle, though certain encounter values will result in a MissingNo. with the appearance of one of three 64<U+00D7>64 pixel [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] used elsewhere in the game.<ref name="unauthorized">{{cite book |publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks |year=2001 |last=Schlesinger |first=Hank |title=Pokemon Future: The Unauthorized Guide |isbn=0312977581 |pages=184-188}}</ref>

==Reaction and reception==
Though appearing in only two titles in the series, the glitch has had significant impact. Nintendo has described MissingNo. as a "programming quirk" and has warned against encountering it,<ref name="tech"/><ref name="NP"/> later removing the glitch in the game's follow up title, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]''.<ref name="guide"/> Despite Nintendo's warnings, due to MissingNo.'s perceived positive effect, information on how to encounter it was printed in several magazines and player's guides.<ref name="guide">{{cite book |last=Loe |first=Casey |year=1999 |title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Special Pikachu Edition Includes Red-Yellow-Blue |publisher=Versus Books |isbn=1930206151 |page=125}}</ref><ref name="Pocket">{{cite journal |last=Staff |year=1999 |month=Summer/Fall |title=Top 50 Games |journal=Pocket Games |issue=1 |page=96}}</ref><ref name="rb">{{cite web |url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_172.html |title=Guides: Pokemon Blue and Red |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-06-08}}</ref> In 2009, [[IGN]] placed MissingNo. third on their "Top 10 Easter Eggs" in video games list, describing it as a "glitchimon" and noting it as useful for duplicating the game's limited quantity items.<ref name="topten">{{cite web |url=http://games.ign.com/articles/971/971383p2.html |title=Gaming's Top 10 Easter Eggs |page=2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |author=Staff |accessdate= 2009-06-07 |date=2009-04-09}}</ref> In a related article, they stated regarding MissingNo. "It really says something about ''Pokemon''{{sic}} fans that they took what is a potentially game ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokemon.{{sic}}"<ref name="why">{{cite web |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/933/933126p1.html |title=Pokemon Report: OMG Hacks |author=DeVries, Jack |date=2008-11-24 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=2009-06-07}}</ref>

Reactions by players to MissingNo. has been the subject of [[sociological]] studies regarding individuals and video games. Sociologist [[William Sims Bainbridge]] noted in a study of video game glitches that Game Freak "spawned one of the most popular glitches ever in game history", citing the various good and bad results of it and the creative usage by players.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |authorlink=William Sims Bainbridge |coauthors=Wilma Alice Bainbridge |year=2007 |month=7 |title=Creative Usage of Software Errors: Glitches and Cheats |journal=Social Science Computer Review |publisher=SAGE Publications |doi=10.1177/0894439306289510 |accessdate=2009-06-07 }}</ref> The book ''Playing with Videogames'' studied the effect of MissingNo. in depth, noting players' tendency to react to the glitch with curiosity and examine their own notes along with individual "sightings" reports, and assess and critique each other's findings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Playing with Videogames |pages=117-118 |last=Newman |first=James |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2008 |isbn=0415385237}}</ref> The book further noted the extent to which gaming communities revolving around ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' have attempted to make the glitch Pok<U+00E9>mon a real aspect of the game's world, through detailed fan backstories, hand drawn images, and similar, in turn inspiring creativity.<ref>{{cite book |title=Playing with Videogames |pages=118 |last=Newman |first=James |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2008 |isbn=0415385237}}</ref> It last noted that in this process the individuals were celebrating and publicizing imperfections in the game while attempting to imprint themselves on the [[canon]], and added that the circumstances surrounding MissingNo.'s popularity is a unique case with little room to reproduce.<ref>{{cite book |title=Playing with Videogames |pages=119 |last=Newman |first=James |publisher=Taylor & Francis |year=2008 |isbn=0415385237}}</ref>
