[[Air Vice-Marshal]] '''Sir Philip Woolcott Game''' [[Order of the Bath|GCB]] [[Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]] [[Order of the British Empire|GBE]] [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] ([[30 March]] [[1876]] <U+2013> [[4 February]] [[1961]]) was a British [[Royal Air Force]] commander and [[Governors of New South Wales|Governor]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

==Early and familiy life==
Philip Game was born in [[Streatham]], [[Surrey]] in [[England]] on [[30 March]] [[1876]] to George Beale Game, a merchant from [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]] in [[Worcestershire]] and his wife Clara, n<U+00E9>e Vincent.  Before entering the Army, he was educated at [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. In 1908 he married Gwendoline Margaret Hughes-Gibb. They had three children, Philip (known as Bill), David and Rosemary.

==Military service==
Following officer training at the [[Royal Military Academy Woolwich]], Game was commissioned into the [[British Army]] on [[2nd November]] [[1895]].  During the early part of the [[First World War]], he served as a staff officer and in early [[1916]] Game transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] as a result of [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard's]] request for an experienced staff officer to serve in his HQ.  Game transferred to the [[Royal Air Force]] on its creation in [[1918]]. In [[1922]] he was promoted to the rank of [[Air Vice-Marshal]] and appointed [[Air Officer Commanding]] RAF India.  The next year he took up the post of [[Air Member for Personnel]], which he was to hold for over five years until his retirement from the RAF in [[1929]].

==Governor of New South Wales==
He was appointed Governor of New South Wales in 1930, serving until 1935. Along with the [[Premiers of the Australian states|State Premier]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] and others, Game was a participant at the official opening of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] on [[19th March]], [[1932]], where he made a speech.

After the [[UAP]] [[Government of Australia|federal government]] of [[Joseph Lyons]] came to power in January 1932, it passed the ''Financial Agreement Enforcement Act'', forcing the NSW government to adhere to its debt commitments and to cut government spending (see also [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/fala1932398]). In response, Lang withdrew all the state's funds from government bank accounts so the federal government could not gain access to the money. Sir Philip advised Lang that in his view this action was illegal, and that if Lang did not reverse it he would dismiss the government. Lang stood firm, and issued a leaflet in defiance of Game. On [[13th May]] [[1932]] the Governor dismissed Lang's government and appointed the UAP leader, [[Bertram Stevens]], as [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]]. Stevens immediately called an [[election]], at which Lang's [[Political party|party]] was heavily defeated.

This was the only case of an Australian government with the confidence of the lower house of parliament being dismissed by a Vice-Regal representative, until [[Governor-General]] [[John Kerr|Sir John Kerr]] [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|dismissed]] [[Gough Whitlam]]'s government on [[11th November]], [[1975]].

==Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis==
After his term ended, Game returned to Britain.  He served as [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis]] from 1935 until 1945. In 1943, in an attempt to prevent burglaries, Game urged householders not to keep furs, adapting a verse from Chapter 9 of [[Ecclesiastes]] saying, {{Rquote|center|they are no doubt warmer, and look nicer than a tweed coat, but a live dog is better than a dead lion.}} Towards the end of his time as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Game worked to establish a boys' club.  The Sir Philip Game Boys' Club, situated in the London borough of Croydon, was opened in [[1946]].

Sir Philip Game died on [[4 February]] [[1961]].
