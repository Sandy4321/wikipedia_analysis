"'''Hey There'''" is a [[show tune]] from the [[musical play]] ''[[The Pajama Game]],'' written by [[Richard Adler]] and [[Jerry Ross (composer)|Jerry Ross]]. It was published in [[1954 in music|1954]]. It was introduced by [[John Raitt]] in the original production.
It was subsequently recorded by a number of artists. The recording by [[Rosemary Clooney]] reached #1 on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s chart in 1954. Another version was also recorded about the same time by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], reaching #16 on Billboard's retail chart. The song (counting all recorded versions) also reached #1 on the [[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]] chart in 1954.

In the context of the show, Sid sings it to a recording device, telling himself that he's foolish to continue his advances to Babe.  He plays the tape back, and after responding to his own comments, sings a duet with himself.

A popular edit of the single is in ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', in the episode "[[Tea for Three]]", when [[Uncle Albert]] (played by [[Buster Merryfield]]) sings the song (replacing "Hey There" with "Ada", the name of his wife) in the talent contest at their local pub, the Nags Head. He later tells Rodney that he won the talent contest, much to his horror.
