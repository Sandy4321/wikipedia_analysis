'''Strike Fighter Squadron 154''' {VFA-54), also known as the "Black Knights", are a [[United States Navy]] [[F/A-18F Super Hornet]] fighter squadron stationed at [[Naval Air Station Lemoore]]. 


==History==
===Late 1940s to the 1980s===
VFA-154 began its career as VFB-718 on [[July 1]], [[1946]] based at [[NAS Floyd Bennett]] in [[New York]] flying the [[F-6F Hellcat]] as a [[Naval Reserve]] squadron. Soon they transitioned to the [[F4U Corsair]]. The unit went through several designation changes as well, becoming VF-68A then VF-837. When the unit was called VF-837 the squadron moved to [[Moffett Federal Airfield|NAS Moffet Field]] in [[California]]. VF-837 flew a combat cruise in the [[Korean War]] of the [[USS Antietam (CV-36)]]. By this time they were flying the [[F9F-2 Panther]]. VF-837 returned from their first cruise and started working up for a second cruise. On [[February 4]], [[1953]] while passing under the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] onboard the [[USS Princeton (CV-37)]] and on their way back to [[Korea]], VF-837 became VF-154. VF-154 dropped 470 tons of bombs and expanded 1,500 000 round of ammunition in Korea and on [[June 15]], 1953 VF-154 flew 48 sorties on a single day, setting a record for a Navy squadron. By now the squadron had transitioned to the F9F-5 Panther.

After the Panther, VF-154 transitioned to the [[F-3 Demon]], followed with the [[F-8 Crusader]] in 1957. With their new aircraft VF-154 changed their insignia and name. They were previously known as <U+201C>The Grand Slammers<U+201D> and their insignia was a flaming panther. Their new insignia was crated by [[Milton Caniff]], creator of the [[Steve Canyon]] cartoon. The new insignia was the Black Knights, armed with a sword to strike down the enemies of peace and justice and a shield to protect those unable to defend themselves. After Korea, the next war was the [[Vietnam War]]. Their first deployment was in [[1965]] onboard the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)]], part of Carrier Air Wing 15. Their first combat strikes occurred on [[February 7]] and their combat cruise lasted until November the same year. After that yearly combat cruises followed and VF-154 soon transitioned to the [[F-4 Phantom II]] and became part of Carrier Air Wing 2, where it remained until [[1980]]. After a second cruise with the Coral Sea, the Black Knights shifted carrier to the [[USS Ranger (CV-61)]] and completing five more cruises to [[South East Asia]].

After the [[1970]] cruise, VF-154 transitioned to the F-4J Phantom and undertook the squadrons final Vietnam cruise. VF-154 participated in some of the last US Navy strikes of the war and they were awarded the Clifton Award, recognising them as the best fighter squadron in the Navy.  In [[1979]] the unit transitioned to the F-4S, the last Navy version of the aircraft, but returned to the F-4N in January [[1981]]. Several cruises with the USS Coral Sea followed as the carrier did not have strong enough decks to carry the [[F-14]], thus VF-154, and sister squadron [[VF-21]], were among the last units to convert to the F-14A. VF-154 finally transitioned to the F-14A in October [[1983]]. Due to their late equipment the squadron received [[TARPS]] capable F-14s from the start. The first cruise with the F-14 was in [[1985]] onboard the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)]] as part of Carrier Air Wing 14. Several further cruises onboard <U+201C>Connie<U+201D> followed, with one taking place in [[1987]], during this cruise they operated in the [[Persian Gulf]], intercepting [[Iran|Iranian]] [[P-3 Orion|P-3]]s and conducting movements in the [[Gulf of Oman]], at the so called <U+201C>Gonzo<U+201D> station.

===1990s===

After the cruises with Constellation, CVW-15 moved to the [[USS Independence (CV-62)]] with this carrier, VF-154 and VF-21 became the first F-14 squadrons to arrive in the Persian Gulf as part of [[Operation Desert Shield]], although they never took part in [[Operation Desert Storm]] and Independence returned to the US before the war started.

In August [[1991]], the USS Independence become home based at [[Yokosuka]], [[Japan]], to replace the Coral Sea. VF-154 stayed with the carrier for this, but moved from CVW-14 to Carrier Air Wing 5 and from [[NAS Miramar]] to [[NAF Atsugi]], thus becoming the first forward deployed F-14 squadron. At the same time as joining CVW-5 VF-154 became the first F-14 squadron to deploy with an air-to- ground bombing capability. Along with the [[USS Nimitz (CVN-68)]], Independence and her air wing were involved in operations to demonstrate US resolve in support of [[Taiwan]]. The [[1995]] [[Chinese military]] exercises once raised tension in the region and signalled China's opposition to Taiwan<U+2019>s Presidential Election. 

With the cut back on F-14 squadrons VF-154 sister squadron, VF-21, was disestablished, leaving the Black Knights as the only F-14 squadron in CVW-5. As well as keeping their TARPS role VF-154 have become very active in the air-to-ground role. Regular deployments aboard the Independence have continued. VF-154 conducted carrier qualifications onboard the boat during November of [[1996]].

The Black Knights arrived in [[Fremantle]], [[Australia]], on [[April 11]], [[1997]], having just completed participation in the exercise 'Tandem Thrust'. With VF-154's F-14A's severely showing their age the squadron swapped six of its worst airframes for six from [[VF-213]], which had visited onboard the [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)]], a few weeks earlier. The Black Knights finally received [[LANTIRN]] upgrades to their F-14A's in the last quarter of 1997 and January [[1998]]. Although relatively late in the upgrade cycle, VF-154 was able to benefit - their F-14A's being the first in the Fleet to receive the new [[AN/ALR-67]] Radar Warning Receiver. 

World tensions soon meant VF-154 was called to action, on [[January 5]], [[1998]] CVW-5 was called to action due to trouble in the Persian Gulf. USS Independence arrived to the area on [[February 4]]. VF-154 was leading the first CVW-5 flight package into southern [[Iraq]] within 24 hours. Although the tension eased the carrier and air wing remained on station until the end of May. Several missions were flown each day as part of [[Operation Southern Watch]]. With their new LANTIRN pods VF-154 were able to provide high quality video of potential targets day or night. 

Sea duty called again in July, as CVW-5 made their last cruise onboard USS Independence. After a cross [[Pacific]] transit to [[Pearl Harbor]] the air wing cross decked to their new home - USS Kitty Hawk. During the transfer, Kitty Hawk picked up the famous 'Don't Tread On Me' Jack - signifying her as the oldest ship on active service. Once again the shore period was short, on [[August 30]] the air wing and carrier departed once more. Training began with a VF-154 organised MISSILEX - the F-14's shooting 4 [[AIM-54]]'s and downing 4 targets. The cruise continued with FOAL EAGLE exercises in the seas around [[Korea]]. By the time the Black Knights pulled back into port during November they had spent 240 days at sea.

The commitment of the Black Knights was recognised soon after - the squadron gaining numerous awards, most notably the Pacific Fleet Battle 'E', Safety 'S' and 'Boola-Boola' missile awards. Later in [[1999]] VF-154 would add the Clifton award to that batch. Preparations for deployment soon started, in January jets deployed to [[Guam]] for SFARP training. A few weeks later they received their first Digital Flight Control System (DFCS) equipped jets. On the [[March 2]], VF-154 sailed onboard USS Kitty Hawk for their first full WESTPAC deployment. During the four months of cruise the Black Knights took part in Tandem Thurst '99, an unexpected Persian Gulf period (due to [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)]] being called to cover events in [[Kosovo]]), plus port visits to [[Hong Kong]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]]. The cruise also saw a new first - two Naval Aviators reaching 1000 traps on the same day. [[Captain]]. R. McHarg, [[Commander, Air Group]] of CVW-5 landed onboard in a specially painted VF-154 F-14A. His pilot for the historic trap was [[Lieutenant]]. D. Baxter. Later the same day the [[Commanding Officer]] of [[VFA-27]], [[Commander]]. K. Hutcheson, made his landing in a [[F/A-18]]. Both landings took place in the Persian Gulf, where Kitty Hawk and CVW-5 completed 5,426 sorties, including 1,356 combat missions over Southern Iraq.

===2000's===

Between 1999 and [[2002]], VF-154 would participate in five deployments in the Pacific as well as the [[Indian Ocean]]. In 2001, CVW-5 flew more than 600 missions and 100 combat sorties in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. 

In [[2003]], VF-154 would make their last cruise with the F-14, this time in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. This would be the first time CVW-5 would deploy to the Persian Gulf since 1999. The USS Kitty Hawk arrived on station on [[February 26]] and CVW-5 was chosen to be the dedicated [[Close Air Support]] wing. VF-154 deployed with 12 F-14A<U+2019>s and detached five F-14As and five air crews to the [[Al Udeid]] Air Base in [[Qatar]] where these F-14<U+2019>s and its crews would work closely with [[Royal Air Force]] [[Panavia Tornado]]<U+2019>s, [[USAF]] [[F-15E]]<U+2019>s, [[F-16]]CGs and F-16CJ<U+2019>s and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[F/A-18]]As. [[CENTCOM]] had contacted CVW-5 and specifically asked for the air wing to deploy [[Forward Air Controller]] capable Tomcats and crews to support coalition land-based aircraft as well as [[Special Forces]] squads operating inside Iraq. The F-14s were usually paired with the aircraft already deployed to the airbase, dropping bomb themselves or guiding other aircraft bombs. The aircrews would fly daily missions and in one 48 hour period the Black Knights detachment flew 14 sorties totalling 100 hours of flight time. The crews at Al Udeid flew more than 300 combat hours and delivered 50 000 pounds of ordnance, (98 [[GBU-12]]s) during the 21 day stay at the airbase.

On [[April 1]], VF-154 lost one of their aircraft over southern Iraq due to that it suffered a single engine and fuel transfer system failure which caused the remaining engine to run dry. The crew already two hours into their mission and had dropped some bombs were forced to eject when the fuel had counted down, but the crew was soon picked up by an [[HH-60G]] helicopter from the USAF [[301st Rescue Squadron]] [[Combat Search and Rescue]]. This F-14A was the first coalition aircraft to crash in Iraq since the start of Iraqi Freedom. 

The remaining F-14s on the USS Kitty Hawk made a valuable contribution to the war effort, compromising mostly of junior officers and expended 246 GBU-12s, ten [[GBU-16]]s and four [[GBU-10]]s during 27 days of combat. By the end of the war, VF-154 had dropped 358 laser guided bombs, buddy lased 65 more and passed target coordinates for 32 [[JDAM]]<U+2019>s during the course of 286 sorties. The Black Knights had expended more ordnance than any other unit in CVW-5, despite flying the oldest jets in the air wing.

In September of 2003 the Black Knights left Atsugi for the last time and ended their proud 13 years in Japan and 20 years in the Tomcat. A month later, VF-154 was redesignated VFA-154 at their new home at [[NAS Lemoore]], [[California]], and began transitioning to the Navy's newest strike fighter, the [[F/A-18F Super Hornet]]. They completed their first Super Hornet cruise in the summer of [[2005]] aboard the [[USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70)]], part of Carrier Air Wing 9.Currently they are part of the [[USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74)]] as a part of CVW-9.
