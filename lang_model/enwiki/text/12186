The '''Wawer massacre''' refers to the execution of 107 [[Poland|Polish]] civilians on the night of 26 to 27 December 1939 by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupiers of [[Wawer]] (near [[Warsaw]]), Poland. The execution was a response to the deaths of two German NCOs. 120 people were arrested and 114 shot, of which 7 survived.

It is considered to be one of the first [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|large scale massacres of Polish civilians by Nazi Germany]] in [[occupied Poland]].

== Background ==
[[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded and occupied Poland]] in September 1939. From the start, the war against Poland was intended to be the fulfilment of a plan described by [[Adolf Hitler]] in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. The main gist of the plan was for all of [[Eastern Europe]] to become part of a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]], the German ''[[Lebensraum]]'' ("living space").

On the evening of 26 December, two known Polish criminals, [[Marian Prasu<U+0142>a]] and [[Stanis<U+0142>aw D<U+0105>bek]], killed two German non-commissioned officers from Baubataillon 538.<ref name="ZwW">{{pl icon}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20080213130306/http://powstanie-warszawskie-1944.ac.pl/zbrodnie_wawer.htm Zbrodnia w Wawrze]</ref><ref name="Piotrowski25">{{en icon}} {{cite book | author =[[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] | coauthors = | title =Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide... | year =1997 | editor = | pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=hC0-dk7vpM8C&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=Wawer+1939++-wikipedia&source=web&ots=vC8DQHO6Zn&sig=0WmHmwrkQdlePban-kujYMtPYck&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=5&ct=result p. 25]| chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =McFarland & Company | location = | ISBN= 0-7864-0371-3 | format = | accessdate = }}</ref> After learning of it, the acting commander of the [[Ordnungspolizei]] in Warsaw, colonel [[Max Daume]]<ref>see [[:pl:Max Daume]]</ref> ordered an immediate reprisal, consisting of a series of arrests of random Polish males, aged 16 to 70, found in the region where the killings occurred (in [[Wawer]] and the neighboring [[Anin]] villages).<ref name="ZwW"/><ref name="ler"/>

== Aftermath ==
It was one of the earliest [[massacre]]s (probably the second, after the [[Bochnia massacre]] of 52 civilians on December 18) to occur in [[occupied Poland]]. It was also one of the first instances of the large scale implementation by Germany of the doctrine of [[collective responsibility]] in the [[General Government]] in Poland since the end of the invasion in September.<ref name="ler">[[Jerzy Jan Lerski]], Piotr Wr<U+00F3>bel, Richard J.

Soon after the massacre, a Polish youth resistance organization, "[[Wawer (organization)|Wawer]]", was created.<ref name="ZwW"/> It was part of the [[Gray Ranks|Szare Szeregi]] (the underground [[Polish Scouting Association]]), and its first act was to create a series of [[graffiti]] in [[Warsaw]] around the Christmas of 1940, commemorating the massacre.<ref name="ZwW"/><ref name="Piotrowski25"/><ref name="BW"/>  Members of the AK Wawer "Small Sabotage" unit painted "Pom<U+015B>cimy Wawer" ("We'll avenge Wawer") on Warsaw walls. At first they painted the whole text, then to save time they shortened it to two letters, P and W. Later they invented [[Kotwica]] -"Anchor" - the symbol, a combination of these 2 letters, was easy and fast to paint. Next kotwica gained more meanings - Polska Walcz<U+0105>ca ("Fighting Poland") . It also stands for Wojsko Polskie ("[[Polish Army]]") and Powstanie Warszawskie ("[[Warsaw Uprising]]"). Finally "Kotwica" became a patriotic symbol of defiance against the occupiers and was painted on building walls everywhere.

On 3 March 1947, the Polish [[Supreme National Tribunal for Trial of War Criminals|Supreme National Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals]] (''Najwy<U+017C>szy Trybuna<U+0142> Narodowy'') sentenced Max Daume to death.<ref name="ZwW"/> Wilhelm Wenzel was extradited to Poland by the Soviets<!-- vague, the Soviet Union perhaps? --> in 1950 and executed in November 1951.<ref name="ZwW"/>

There is now a monument in Wawer commemorating the massacre.
