The '''Integrated High Performance Turbine Engine Technology''' program was a project of the [[United States military]].  Its objective was to conduct science and technology research that would secure advancements in the engineering of the [[gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] used in military aircraft.  It ran from 1987 until 2005.

IHPTET designated goals in each of three engine classes: [[turbofan]]/[[turbojet]], [[turboprop]]/[[turboshaft]], and [[expendable engines]]. For the turbofan class the primary goal was to double the engine [[thrust-to-weight ratio]].

The program made many significant developments which have been employed in such aircraft as the [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35 / Joint Strike Fighter]].  It was firmly regarded as successful although it did not fully achieve its explicit goals.  It was succeeded by the [[Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engines]] (VAATE) program.
