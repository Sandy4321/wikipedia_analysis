'''Hock E Aye Vi Edgar Heap of Birds''') (b. 1954) (enrolled in the [[Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes]]) creates art that includes multi-disciplinary forms of public art messages, large scale drawings, Neuf Series acrylic paintings, prints,<ref>Reno, 72</ref> and monumental porcelain enamel on steel outdoor sculpture.

==Early life==
'''Hachivi Edgar Heap of Birds''' was born on 22 November 1954 in [[Wichita, Kansas]], where his father worked in the aeronautical industry. He attended East High School in Wichita and graduated in 1972. After graduation in 1972, Heap of Birds studied at [[Haskell Indian Nations University|Haskell Indian School]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]].<ref>Lester, 227</ref>

Heap of Birds received his MFA from [[Tyler School of Art]], [[Temple University]] in 1979, his BFA from The [[University of Kansas]] in 1976, and has undertaken graduate studies at The [[Royal College of Art]], [[London, England]] from 1976-1977.<ref>Lester, 227</ref>

==Professional career==
[[File:Heap of Birds Wheel.jpg|thumb|left|''Wheel'']]
Heap of Birds has taught as Visiting Professor at [[Yale University]], [[Rhode Island School of Design]], and [[Michaelis School of Fine Art]], [[University of Cape Town]], South Africa.  At The [[University of Oklahoma]], Professor Heap of Birds teaches in Native American Studies and Fine Arts.  His seminars explore issues of the contemporary artist on a local, national and international basis.

Heap of Birds's critical reputation has been established most by his political and site-specific public signage projects. One example is ''Building Minnesota'' (1990), a signage installation mounted on the banks of the Mississippi River in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and commissioned by the [[Walker Art Center]].<ref>Reno, 72</ref> In it, Heap of Birds set forty large, metal, billboard-like signs along Minneapolis's downtown riverfront. The signs honored the forty Dakota men who were sentenced to death by Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Jackson after the US-Dakota Conflict of 1862, in what is the largest mass execution in American history. 

Recently Heap of Birds created a fifty-foot signature, outdoor sculpture titled: "Wheel," as a signature entrance piece at Daniel Liebeskind's addition to the [[Denver Art Museum]]. The circular porcelain enamel on steel work was commissioned by The Denver Art Museum and is inspired by the traditional [[Medicine Wheel National Historic Landmark|Medicine Wheel]] of the [[Big Horn Mountains]] of Wyoming.

== Awards ==
He has received grants and awards from '''The National Endowment for the Arts''', '''Rockefeller Foundation''', '''Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation''', '''Lila Wallace Foundation''', '''Bonfil Stanton Foundation''' and '''The Pew Charitable Trust'''.
