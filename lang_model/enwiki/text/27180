The '''White-tailed Lapwing''' or '''White-tailed Plover''' ('''''Vanellus leucurus''''') is a [[wader]] in the [[lapwing]] genus.

It breeds semi-colonially on inland marshes in [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and southern [[Russia]]. Four eggs are laid in a ground nest. The Iraqi and Iranian breeders are mainly residents, but Russian birds [[bird migration|migrate]] south in winter to south [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and north east [[Africa]]. It is a very rare vagrant in western [[Europe]], the first example in Britain being found at [[Packington (disambiguation)|Packington]], [[Warwickshire]] on [[12 July]], [[1975]].

This elegant{{Fact|date=November 2007}} medium-sized lapwing is long-legged and fairly long-billed. It is the only lapwing likely to be seen in other than very shallow water, where it picks [[insect]]s and other small prey mainly from the surface.  

Adults are slim erect birds with a brown back and foreneck, paler face and grey breast. Its long yellow legs, pure white tail and distinctive brown, white and black wings make this species unmistakable. Young birds have a scaly back, and may show some brown in the tail.

The breeding season call is a ''peewit'', similar to [[Northern Lapwing]].

The White-tailed Lapwing is one of the species to which the ''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds'' ([[AEWA]]) applies.
