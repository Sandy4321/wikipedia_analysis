'''Buffeljags River''' (Afrikaans for ''Buffalo hunt''), is a river that originates where two other rivers meet, the one being the [[Grootvadersbos River]] (Afrikaans for ''Grandfather's woods'') and the other the [[Tradou River]]. The confluence is just east of a small town, [[Suurbraak]], [[Western Cape]] province. The [[Tredouw's Pass]] is situated just north (in the Langeberg) of this meeting point. To the west of the town the river flows into the [[Buffeljags Dam]], the river then heads south to join the [[Breede River]] (also known as the Bre<U+00EB> River), not far from the [[Bontebok National Park]].
