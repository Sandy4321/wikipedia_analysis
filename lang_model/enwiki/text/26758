'''Neil Francis Tennant''' (born 10 July 1954) is an [[English people|English]] [[musician]], singer and songwriter, who, with bandmate [[Chris Lowe]], make up the successful [[electronic dance music]] duo [[Pet Shop Boys]].

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Tennant was born in [[North Shields]], near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to William (1923<U+2013>2009) and Sheila Tennant (1923<U+2013>2008). He has a sister, Susan, and two brothers, Simon and Philip.<ref>"Literally" by Chris Heath, published 1990</ref>

As a child, Tennant attended [[St. Cuthbert's High School|St. Cuthbert's Grammar School]], an all-boys' [[Roman Catholic]] school in [[Newcastle-Upon-Tyne]]. ([[Sting (musician)|Sting]] went to the same school.) Tennant's songs "This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave" and "[[It's a Sin]]" refer to his early life in [[Catholic]] school and the strict Catholic upbringing there. "It's a Sin" caused controversy with its implicit criticism of Catholic education.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

While at school, Tennant played guitar and cello. At the age of 16, he played in a group called Dust, whose most popular song was called "Can You Hear the Dawn Break?". They were heavily influenced by The [[Incredible String Band]]. During his teenage years, he was a member of the youth theatre at the [[The People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne|People's Theatre]], Newcastle upon Tyne.

===Later life===
In 1975, having completed a degree in history at [[University of North London|North London Polytechnic]] (now [[London Metropolitan University]]), Tennant worked for two years as London Editor for [[Marvel UK]], the UK branch of [[Marvel Comics]]. He was responsible for [[Anglicisation|anglicising]] the dialogue of Marvel's catalogue to suit British readers, and for indicating where women needed to be redrawn more decently for the British editions.<ref>{{cite book | url= http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pet-Shop-Boys-Annually/dp/0723568421 | title= 'Pet Shop Boys, annually (1989) | date=1989}}</ref> He also wrote occasional features for the comics, including interviews with pop stars [[Marc Bolan]] and [[Alex Harvey]]. In 1977, he moved to Macdonald Educational Publishing where he edited ''The Dairy Book Of Home Management'' and various illustrated books about cookery, playing the guitar and other home interests. Then he moved to ITV Books where he edited TV tie-in books. After having commissioned Steve Bush, then the designer of ''[[Smash Hits]]'' and ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', to design a book about the group [[Madness (band)|Madness]], he was offered a job at ''[[Smash Hits]]'' as news editor of the British teen pop magazine in 1982. The following year he became Assistant Editor. He also edited the 1982, 1983 and 1984 editions of ''The Smash Hits Yearbook''.

At ''Smash Hits'', an opportunity arose for him to go to New York to interview [[The Police (band)|The Police]]. While there, Tennant arranged to meet [[Bobby Orlando]], a producer whom both he and Lowe admired. Tennant mentioned that he was writing songs in his spare time and Orlando agreed to record some tracks with him and Lowe at a later date. Orlando subsequently produced the Pet Shop Boys' first single, "[[West End Girls]]".

Tennant neither denied nor confirmed rumours of his sexuality throughout the 1980s, before "[[coming out]]" in a 1994 interview for ''[[Attitude (magazine)|Attitude]]'', a UK [[gay]] lifestyle magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/pet_shop_boys.html |title=>> arts >> Pet Shop Boys |publisher=glbtq |date=2008-09-20 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petshopboys.net/html/interviews/otherinter10.shtml |title=Absolutely Pet Shop Boys Unofficial web site - Interviews - Outrage, October, 1994 |publisher=Petshopboys.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref>

In 1998, Tennant was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/161057.stm | title= 'Luvvies' for Labour | work=BBC News | date=30 August 1998}}</ref> He has since switched allegiance to the [[Liberal Democrats]], citing disillusionment with Labour's ID card scheme.

===Current career and future===
Tennant and Lowe are still going strong as Pet Shop Boys. Tennant has a [[recording studio]] in his home in [[County Durham]] and many songs from 2002's ''[[Release (Pet Shop Boys album)|Release]]'' album were recorded there. Pet Shop Boys' soundtrack for the silent film, ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', was also written and partly recorded there.

Tennant is also known for his support of modern art, and was a judge for the 1998 [[Turner Prize]] as a representative of the Patrons of New Art.

Tennant was the [[executive producer]] for the [[Rufus Wainwright]] album ''[[Release the Stars]]'', released in May 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=21091_0_2_0_C |title=Pet Shop Boys singer produces new album Rufus Wainwright |publisher=Side-line.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>  Wainwright made a special appearance performing the track "Casanova In Hell" at a live Pet Shop Boys show at the [[Mermaid Theatre]], London on 8 May 2006.  The concert was subsequently broadcast on [[BBC Radio 2]] and released on CD with the title 'Concrete', 13 November 2006.

In December 2008 Tennant appeared alongside [[the Killers]] and [[Elton John]] on the Christmas track, "[[Joseph, Better You Than Me]]."

In February 2009, Tennant appeared with [[Chris Lowe]] to receive the [[BRIT Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and did a medley of their songs with [[Brandon Flowers]] from [[The Killers]] and [[Lady Gaga]].

In May 2009, the Pet Shop Boys released the song "[[Love etc.]]", which reached #14 in the UK chart.  Their studio album ''[[Yes (Pet Shop Boys album)|Yes]]'' charted at #4 in the UK albums chart.

==Radio==
In August 1991, Tennant and Lowe were invited to take over [[Simon Bates]]' then mid-morning show on [[BBC Radio 1]] for a week. They chose all the records, which were principally dance tracks. Chris swore on-air once, but they were invited back to fill the same role in July 1992, when they played the seminal Watch Out For Stella remix of [[The Age of Love (Age of Love song)|The Age of Love]] every morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petshopboys.net/html/general/profile.html |title=Profile section |publisher=Petshopboys.net |date=1991-05-27 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref>

In March 2009, Tennant and Lowe had two radio appearances. On 15 March, they presented a radio cover show at [[Absolute Radio]], while DJ [[Geoff Lloyd]] was on holiday. On 16 March, Tennant and Lowe appeared on [[Rob Da Bank]] and Friends showcasing their 'A to Z of music'.
