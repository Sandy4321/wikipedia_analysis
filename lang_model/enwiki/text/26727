{{Syndicalism sidebar}}
'''Sorelianism''' refers to the advocacy or support of the ideology and thinking of French revolutionary [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]]. It typically refers to the anti-individualist, anti-liberal, anti-materialist, [[Antipositivism|anti-positivist]], anti-rationalist, [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] syndicalism that Sorel promoted.<ref>Sternhell et al., pp. 77-78.</ref> Sorelians oppose [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] [[democracy]], the developments of the 18th century, the [[secular]] spirit, and the [[French Revolution]], while supporting [[Classicism|classical]] tradition.<ref name=sternhell78>Sternhell et al., p. 78.</ref> Sorel believed that the victory of the [[proletariat]] in [[Class conflict|class struggle]] could only be achieved through the power of myth and a [[general strike]].<ref>Sternhell et al., p. 76.</ref> To Sorel, the aftermath of class conflict would involve rejuvenation of both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.<ref name=christensen18/> Initially Sorel was a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of [[Marxism]], but in 1910 announced his abandonment of [[Socialism|socialist]] literature and claimed in 1914, using an aphorism of [[Benedetto Croce]] that "socialism is dead" due to the "decomposition of Marxism".<ref name=sternhell78/> Sorel became a supporter of [[Maurrassisme|Maurrassian]] [[integral nationalism]] beginning in 1909 that influenced his works.<ref name=sternhell78/> Sorelianism is considered to be a precursor to [[fascism]].<ref>Sternhell et al., p. 90.</ref>

== Concepts ==
=== General strike ===
Sorel believed that class war between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie would result from a general strike.<ref name=midlarsky93>Midlarsky, p. 93.</ref> Sorel believed that the victory of the proletariat would end democracy, individualism, liberalism, and compromise between workers and the democratic capitalist society.<ref name=midlarsky93/>

=== Syndicalist society ===
The ideal Sorelian syndicalist society would consist of workers' [[syndicate]]s that would serve as the only social authority, all other authorities would be destroyed.<ref name=midlarsky93/>

=== Moral regeneration ===
Sorelianism focused on the moral regeneration of society and the rescue of civilization rather than only the working-class.<ref name=sternhell17>Sternhell, p. 17.</ref> Sorelianism was more focused on support of socialism as a means for revolutionary transformation of society rather than a movement of the proletariat or a movement with a specific social structure.<ref name=sternhell17/>

===Class conflict and class rejuvenation===
Sorel advocated the separation of groups in society, including support of the syndicalist model of a society where the proletariat workers would be autonomous and separate from bourgeois industrialists.<ref name=midlarsky93/> Sorel refused the idea of negotiation between the classes.<ref name=midlarsky93/> However, Sorel believed that it was the proletariat's task to awaken the bourgeoisie from intellectual stupor to recover its morality, "productive energy", and "feeling of its own dignity" that Sorel claimed had been lost because of democratic ideals.<ref name=christensen18>Christensen et al., p. 18.</ref>

Hence, Sorel believed that both the end result of class conflict would in the end result in the rejuvenation of both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.<ref name=christensen18/>

=== Revisionism of Marxism ===
Sorel focused on the ethical dimension of Marxism, claiming its utility for historical analysis and a means for transforming society.<ref name=sternhell17/> However, Sorel criticized the deterministic, materialist, and mechanist components of Marxism.<ref name=sternhell17/> Sorel criticized vulgar interpretations of Marxism for being unfaithful to Marx's real intentions.<ref name=sternhell17/> Sorel claimed that Marx was not materialist at all, noting that Marx did not regard psychological developments of people as part of the economic process.<ref name=stanley206>Stanley, p. 206.</ref> Sorel noted that Marx described the necessary ideological superstructure of societies: law, the organization of the state, religion, art, and philosophy.<ref name=stanley206/> As a result, Sorel claimed that "no great philosophy can be established without being based on art and on religion".<ref name=stanley206/>

== Sorelianism and French integral nationalism ==
Interest in Sorelian thought arose in the French [[Right-wing politics|political right]], particularly by French [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Charles Maurras]] of ''[[Action Fran<U+00E7>aise]]'' and his supporters.<ref name=sternhell82>Sternhell et al., p. 82.</ref> While Maurras was a staunch opponent of Marxism, he was supportive of Sorelianism for its opposition to [[liberal democracy]].<ref name=sternhell82/> Maurras famously stated "a socialism liberated from the democratic and cosmopolitan element fits nationalism well as a well made glove fits a beautiful hand".<ref>Holmes, p. 60.</ref> In the summer of 1909, Sorel endorsed French integral nationalism and praised Maurras.<ref name=sternhell78/> Sorel was impressed by the significant numbers of "ardent youth" that enrolled in ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise''.<ref>Sternhell et al., p. 80.</ref> Sorel's turn to nationalism resulted in his disregarding of Marx and adopting support of the views of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].<ref>Stuart, p. 149.</ref> In 1910, Sorel along with ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' nationalists [[<U+00C9>douard Berth]] and [[Georges Valois]] agreed to form a journal titled ''La Cit<U+00E9> fran<U+00E7>aise'' that would promote a form of national-socialism, however this was abandoned.<ref>Sternhell et al., p. 83.</ref> Afterwards, Sorel supported another nationalist newspaper, ''L'Ind<U+00E9>pendence'' and began writing anti-Semitic content claiming that France was under attack from "Jewish invaders".<ref>Sternhell et al., p. 85.</ref> In 1911, on the issue of Sorelian syndicalism, Valois announced to the Fourth Congress of ''Action Fran<U+00E7>aise'' that "It was not a mere accident that our friends encountered the militants of syndicalism. The nationalist movement and the syndicalist movement, alien to another though they may seem, because of their present positions and orientations, have more than one common objective."<ref name=sternhell82/>

During his association with French nationalism, Sorel joined Valois in the ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', an organization that Valois declared to provide "a common platform for nationalists and leftist antidemocrats".<ref name=sternhell11>Sternhell, p. 11.</ref> The organization recognized both Proudhon and Sorel as two great thinkers who had "prepared the meeting of the two French traditions that had opposed each other throughout the nineteenth century: nationalism and authentic socialism uncorrupted by democracy, represented by syndicalism".<ref name=sternhell11/> ''Cercle Proudhon'' announced that it supported the replacement of bourgeois ideology and democratic socialism with a new ethic of an alliance of nationalism with syndicalism, as those "two synthesizing and convergent movements, one at the extreme right and the other at the extreme left, that have begun the siege and assault on democracy".<ref name=sternhell11/> ''Cercle Proudhon'' supported the replacement of the liberal order with a new world that was "virile, heroic, pessimistic, and puritanical<U+2014>based on the sense of duty and sacrifice: a world where the mentality of warriors and monks would prevail".<ref>Sternhell, pp. 11-12.</ref> The society would be dominated by a powerful avant-garde proletarian elite that would serve as an aristocracy of producers, and allied with intellectual youth dedicated to action against the decadent bourgeoisie.<ref>Sternhell, p. 12.</ref>

== Sorelianism and Fascism ==
Upon Sorel's death, an article in the [[Italian Fascism|Italian Fascist]] doctrinal review ''Gerarchia'' edited by [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Agostino Lanzillo]], a known Sorelian, declared "Perhaps fascism may have the good fortune to fulfill a mission that is the implicit aspiration of the whole oeuvre of the master of syndicalism: to tear away the proletariat from the domination of the Socialist party, to reconstitute it on the basis of spiritual liberty, and to animate it with the breath of creative violence. This would be the true revolution that would mold the forms of the Italy of tommorrow."<ref>Sternhell et al., p. 93.</ref>

== Notable adherents ==
Aside from Sorel himself, there were a number of adherents of Sorelianism in the early 20th century. Sorel was a mentor to [[Hubert Lagardelle]] who, like Sorel, supported the segregation of social classes and who despised the bourgeoisie, democracy, democratic socialism, parliamentarism, social democracy, and [[universal suffrage]].<ref>Hellman, p. 35</ref> [[Antonio Gramsci]] was influenced by the Sorelian views of social myth.<ref>Gill, p. 19.</ref> Based on influence from Sorel, Gramsci asserted that [[Italy]] and the [[Western world|West]] have suffered from crises of culture and authority due to the "wave of materialism" and the inability of liberalism to achieve consensus and hegemony over society.<ref>Cohen & Arato, p. 144.</ref> Sorel influenced Greek philosopher [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] in Kazantzakis' belief of strife as being creative while viewing peace as decadent.<ref>Bien, p. 7.</ref> [[Jos<U+00E9> Carlos Mari<U+00E1>tegui]] was a Sorelian who claimed that [[Vladimir Lenin]] was a Sorelian and Nietzschean hero.<ref>Schutte, p. 39.</ref>

[[Benito Mussolini]] when he was a Marxist held various positions towards Sorelianism at times. Mussolini stated that he became a syndicalist during the 1904 Italian general strike; his close contact with syndicalists dates to 1902.<ref>Sternhell et al., p. 33.</ref> Mussolini reviewed Sorel's ''Reflections on Violence'' in 1909 and supported Sorel's view of consciousness as being a part of protracted struggle, where people display uplifting and self-sacrificing virtues akin to the heroes of antiquity.<ref name=gregor96>Gregor, p. 96.</ref> Mussolini also supported the Sorelian view of the necessity of violence in revolution.<ref name=gregor96/> He followed Sorel in denouncing humanitarianism and compromise between revolutionary socialists and reformists socialists and bourgeois democrats.<ref name=gregor96/> By 1909, Mussolini supported elitism and anti-parliamentarism, and became a propagandist for the use of "regenerative violence".<ref name=gregor96/> When Sorelians initially began to come close to identifying themselves with nationalism and monarchism in 1911, Mussolini believed that such association would destroy their credibility as socialists.<ref>Gregor, p. 123.</ref>
