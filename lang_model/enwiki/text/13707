In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a mercenary and self-proclaimed ex-member of SOLDIER, a select, [[Supersoldier|genetically augmented]] military unit operating under the [[defacto]] [[world government]] and [[megacorporation]] [[Shinra Electric Power Company]]. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group "AVALANCHE" and driven by a feud with the primary antagonist, [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]],<ref>'''Cloud:''' For me, this is a personal feud. I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past. Saving the planet just happens to be a part of that. I've been thinking.{{cite video game|title=[[Final Fantasy VII]]|developer=[[Square Co.]] |publisher=SCE America |date=1997-09-07 |platform=PlayStation }}</ref> Cloud learns to come to terms with his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader. Cloud has also appeared in several other titles outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Such titles include ''[[Itadaki Street Special]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', ''[[Dissidia: Final Fantasy]]'', ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', and the ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.

Cloud has garnered a primarily positive reception by critics. Described as "iconic," the character has been ranked highly in various published character lists. Cloud remains popular among fans, and continues to place highly in popularity polls. Cloud has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and [[Jewellery|jewelry]].

==Concept and creation==
Cloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]] with influences from [[Yoshinori Kitase]], [[Kazushige Nojima]] and [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]. Originally conceptualized by Sakaguchi as one of only three playable characters in early planning stages for ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud's character saw greater oversight by Nomura than with other characters in previous ''Final Fantasy'' projects.<ref name="egm">{{cite web| title = Interivew with Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura from Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue #196, October 2005.| url = http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml| publisher = Final Fantasy VII Citadel| date = October 2005| work = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| accessdate = 2007-10-09}}</ref> Nomura has said the original parameters of Cloud's character design called for slicked-back, black hair with no spikes. This depiction was to serve as a contrast to the long, flowing silver hair of the game's lead antagonist, Sephiroth. However, to make Cloud stand out more and emphasize his role in the game as the lead protagonist, Nomura altered Cloud's design to give him spiky, bright, blond hair.<ref name="designs">{{cite web | author=Khosla, Sheila | year=2003 | title=Tetsuya Nomura's 20s | url=http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=81&more=1 | publisher=FLAREgamer | accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref> Furthermore, Nomura was called upon to supervise Cloud's various lines and personality traits.<ref name="twointerview"/> Kitase and Nojima, meanwhile, were in charge of developing Cloud's background and his relationship with the character of Sephiroth.<ref>{{cite web| title = FFVII Not Being Remade -- Nomura.| url = http://ps3.ign.com/articles/793/793956p1.html| publisher = [[IGN]]| date = 2008-06-04| accessdate = 2008-07-05}}</ref> Kitase said of the character:

{{quote|There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn't a straightforward hero like Superman; rather, he has lots of mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side. Mr. Nomura was also very good at designing a character like that.|Yoshinori Kitase|Electronic Gaming Monthly, October 2005<ref name ="egm" />}}

Nojima has expressed the dynamic of the relationship between the player and the main character in a ''Final Fantasy'' title is something he always puts thought into, and with ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud's subdued nature led him to write scenes with the character in such a way that the players would be placed in the position of deciding for themselves what the character was thinking.<ref name="interviews">{{cite web| title=Behind The Game The Creators| url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/games/FFX/btg/creators.html#1| publisher=Square Enix North America| accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref>

For ''[[Final Fantasy VII Advent Children]]'', Nomura agreed to direct the project, largely in part because of his attachment to the character of Cloud.<ref name="twointerview">{{cite web| title = Interivew with Kazushige Nojima and Tetsuya Nomura from FLAREgamer.| url = http://flaregamer.com/b2article.php?p=109&more=1| publisher = FLAREgamer| date = 2005-10-10 | accessdate = 2008-07-05}}</ref> Nomura, on explaining Cloud's situation in the film, said that "Cloud tried to lead his life positively after the end of FF7 but he cracked...The sin which Cloud thinks he owns is not anyone's fault in particular. It is something Cloud has to overcome by himself." Nojima said that the theme of the story is one of redemption. "If you want to be forgiven, you have to take the hard path in life." Cloud, in choosing to fight against Sephiroth once again, is finally "given healing and forgiveness."<ref name="twointerview"/> Nomura concluded, "Cloud seems to be a weak guy. Generally, heroes are strong, cool and don't have any weaknesses...Although Cloud is a jerk sometimes, he is really human-like. It's through redemption from his friends and having children to protect that he becomes stronger."<ref name="twointerview"/>

In fact, these events did not occur as Cloud describes; rather, they are an amalgamation of Cloud's actual past (as a member of the Shinra army who failed to enter SOLDIER) that of his friend's Zack, mixed with memories gleaned from Tifa's mind, created out of a combination of shame, Jenova cells and manipulation by Sephiroth.<ref name="shame">'''Cloud:''' I never was in SOLDIER.

[[File:Cloud in Last Order.jpg|thumb|Cloud in ''Last Order: Final Fantasy VII'']]

Cloud is also one of the main characters in ''[[Last Order: Final Fantasy VII]]''. This [[original video animation|OVA]] depicts Cloud in two events that were shown in flashbacks in ''Final Fantasy VII''; one at Nibelheim, and the other while escaping from Shinra with Zack. In the Nibelheim flashback, Cloud confronts Sephiroth after finding both Tifa and Zack wounded<U+2014>during their encounter, Sephiroth impales Cloud in the stomach, but Cloud is able to gather enough strength to pull Sephiroth's sword further into his body, enabling him to whip Sephiroth into a nearby wall. The latter portion of the film, Cloud appears totally unresponsive and in the care of Zack, who, while on the run in a hitchhiked pick-up truck, moves to protect Cloud from a Shinra sniper's bullet.

Cloud appears in a small supporting role in ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]''. A year after the events of ''Advent Children'',<ref>'''WRO Member:''' The WRO was originally established three years ago after Meteorfall.{{cite video game|title=[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]|developer=[[Square Enix]]|Publisher=SCE America |date=2006-08-15 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]] }}</ref> Cloud, working alongside Barrett and Tifa, lends his support to the ground forces of the World Regenesis Organization and Vincent in their siege of Midgar and counterattack against the rogue Shinra military unit, Deep Ground.

In ''[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]'', Cloud is presented as a young Shinra infantryman who befriends the SOLDIER [[Zack Fair]]. During the game's conclusion, a dying Zack gives Cloud his Buster Sword, telling him that he is his legacy and that he must continue to live.<ref>'''Zack:''' Continue living. You are proof that I existed. My dreams and pride, I give it all to you. / '''Cloud:''' I am proof that you existed. {{cite video game|title=[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]|developer=[[Square Enix]]|Publisher=SCE America |date=2008-08-24 |platform=[[PlayStation Portable]] }}</ref> After Zack dies, an emotionally-shattered Cloud departs for Midgar alone, and develops the Zack-based persona that he possesses for the majority of ''Final Fantasy VII''.

If you want to become a hero, you have to have dreams. {{cite video game|title=[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]|developer=[[Square Enix]]|Publisher=SCE America |date=2008-08-24 |platform=[[PlayStation Portable]] }}</ref> and another telling Cloud to "say hi" to Aerith if he meets her.<ref>'''Zack:''' If you see Aerith, say hi for me. {{cite video game|title=[[Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]]|developer=[[Square Enix]]|Publisher=SCE America |date=2008-08-24 |platform=[[PlayStation Portable]] }}</ref>

In ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'', Cloud appears in the Olympus Coliseum world. He is depicted with a claw and a crimson cape, and the blade of his sword is wrapped in bandages. Nomura has stated that Cloud's left arm was inspired by [[Vincent Valentine]], noting that, in this game, the character was supposed to illustrate a "demon-like" appearance due to his ties to the "dark side."<ref>{{cite book| title=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania: Revised Edition| publisher=Square Enix| location=Japan| language=Japanese| isbn=4-757-51349-6| year=2002}}</ref> He has been hired by [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]] to kill [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]], but must fight [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] as a prerequisite.<ref>'''Hades:''' That little punk is your next opponent, okay?

Cloud appears later in the Coliseum's battle tournaments. During the credit roll at the end of the game, Cloud is shown reuniting with Aerith and the other residents of Hollow Bastion in the library after Cid has located him and brought him home. Cloud continued his role in the series in the [[Game Boy Advance]] sequel ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' as a [[boss (video games)|boss]] in the Olympus Coliseum<ref>'''Cloud:''' I'm not here for the Cup.

Cloud appears again in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', depicted in his ''Advent Children'' attire. He is still searching for Sephiroth, asking for Sora's help in order to do so while also warning Sora that Sephiroth will attempt to turn him to darkness<ref> '''Sora:''' Oh, Cloud! / '''[[Donald Duck]]:''' Whatcha doing? / '''Cloud Strife:''' I'll get him.

Should the player choose to engage Sephiroth and win the battle, Cloud returns and engages Sephiroth which ends with both of them disappearing in a flash of light after Tifa gives Cloud the light to overcome his darkness. Sora concludes that Cloud is still fighting with Sephiroth, and will not stop until he is defeated.<ref>'''Goofy:''' Where'd they go?

==Cultural impact==
===Critical reception===
The character of Cloud has been overall well received by critics.

Reception among fans has been predominately positive. According to IGN, "he is probably the most famous hero in the history of the Final Fantasy series," and that, although "his star has faded somewhat over the last decade and change, maybe it's just a consequence of overexposure," and "he'll probably still be an icon ten years from now."<ref name=Top-25>{{cite web| url = http://stars.ign.com/articles/874/874708p3.html| title = IGN's Top 25 Final Fantasy Characters| publisher = [[IGN]]| accessdate = 2008-07-20}}</ref> IGN listed him as a possible character in ''[[Super Smash Bros.
