'''Shuttle 2.01''' (Baikal) was the third space shuttle vehicle of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Buran program]], serial number ''11F35 K3''. 2.01's construction was not complete when the Buran program was ended (30-50 percent done), so it remains unfinished.<ref name="k26.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.k26.com/buran/Future/2.01/space_buran_2_01.html | title = Shuttle Buran 2.01 current status | accessdate = 2006-08-05}}</ref>

== Differences from Shuttle Buran ==
The 2.01 is the first of a second series of Burans. The main differences between the second series and the first are located in the cockpit, which has been improved using feedback from the flight of the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] and the construction of [[Ptichka (spacecraft)|Ptichka]].<ref name="k26.com" /> It was also equipped with [[NPP Zvezda|Zvezda]] [[NPP Zvezda K-36|K-36RB]] ejection seats for the first manned flights. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

== Projected flights ==
It was projected in 1989 that the Shuttle 2.01 would have its first manned space test flight in 1994, with a duration of twenty-four hours. The craft would have been equipped with a [[life support system]] and two [[ejection seat]]s. Crew would have consisted of two [[cosmonaut]]s &mdash; [[Igor Volk]] (commander) and [[Aleksandr Ivanchenko]] (flight engineer).<ref name="projected">{{cite web | url = http://www.buran.ru/htm/pilots.htm | title = <U+042D><U+043A><U+0438><U+043F><U+0430><U+0436><U+0438> "<U+0411><U+0443><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430>" <U+041D><U+0435><U+0441><U+0431><U+044B><U+0432><U+0448><U+0438><U+0435><U+0441><U+044F> <U+043F><U+043B><U+0430><U+043D><U+044B>. | publisher = buran.ru | accessdate = 2006-08-05}} {{ru icon}}</ref>

== Post-retirement ==
After residing at the Tushino factory where it was constructed, it was incorrectly announced in 2006 that Shuttle 2.01 would be put on display in the [[Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum]], [[Germany]]. However, the German Museum had actually bought [[OK-GLI]], the jet-powered Buran atmospheric test vehicle, which will be on display in its own new hangar from September 2008.<ref name="k26.com" /> 

Since 2004 the shuttle 2.01 had been left under open sky on a car park in Moscow, near [[Khimki Reservoir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://englishrussia.com/2008/07/30/where-do-shuttles-go/ |title=Where Do Shuttles Go? |publisher=English Russia |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref>
