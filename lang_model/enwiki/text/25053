==History and Discography==

Members of [[ThaMuseMeant]] presented this album to Bill Palmer of [[Hundred Year Flood]] on a trip to [[Austin, Texas]] shortly after it's release.

Grant Hayunga is Goshen, as it has had a revolving cast until Jim Palmer joined as drummer in 2001 and in 2004 brother Bill Palmer began sitting in mostly on [[Hammond]] keys as well as [[Producing]] and [[Engineering]] "Circus Wife" and "Lioness" at [[Frogville Records]] studios.

Goshen played the North Mississippi Hill Country Blues Picnic in 2007 and was invited back for 2008.
