'''''Heads Will Roll EP''''' is Marion Raven's first [[Extended play|EP]] that was released on [[October 31]], [[2006]]. All of the songs were written by Raven in collaboration with a variety artists including Nikki Sixx (M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e), Scott Stevens and Freddy Herrera (The Exies), Keith Nelson and Xavier Muriel(Buckcherry), and Raine Maida (Our Lady Peace). The EP was made available for downloading from iTunes while the hard copy  was exclusively released in the US. In Raven's own words, the tracks on the EP are fun rock songs that are meant for jumping around to. <ref>{{cite web | author=Anne Carlini | publisher=Exclusive Magazine | year= 2006 | url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=692 | title=The Call of The Raven is Upon Us! |accessdate=2007-3-27}}</ref>

==Heads Will Roll==
The EP's title track, "Heads Will Roll", is a re-recorded version of the same track that was previously released in Raven's 2005 internationally released album, ''Here I Am''. The new version removes various sound effects used to muffle Raven's voice and has Scott Steven providing backup vocals. "Heads Will Roll" is the result of Raven's collaboration with [[Nikki Sixx]] and James Michael. It was inspired by Sixx's bass line, which can be heard in many parts of the track, as well as Raven's original idea for a song titled "Heads to the Wall"<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris Carle | publisher=IGN | year= 2006 | url=http://music.ign.com/articles/740/740915p1.html | title=Interview: Marion Raven |accessdate=2007-3-27}}</ref>. "Heads Will Roll" and the other 5 tracks prominently marks Raven's shift from the teen-pop songs of [[M2M (band)]] to a harder rocking, more mature effort. The song was featured on the "[[Van Wilder 2: Rise of the Taj]]" movie soundtrack. 
 
The <U+201C>Heads Will Roll<U+201D> video, which features scenes of a half-naked Raven on top of ten naked women crammed into a futuristic box, also features Xavier Muriel from Buckcherry playing drums and Scott Stevens<U+2019>s backing vocals and playing the electric guitar and Freddy Herrera on bass, both from The Exies. <ref>{{cite web | author=Norway-Culture | publisher=Culture | year= 2007 | url=http://www.norway.org/culture/music/Marion+Raven+at+Madison+Square+Garden.htm | title=Heads Will Roll music video |accessdate=2007-3-27}}</ref> The video caused controversy as it featured exposed breasts.

==Reception==
Reviews of the EP were generally positive, with [[IGN]] stating, "Calling Raven's vocals 'pop' is not a slam, as she has a strong enough voice to make her worthy of some attention."<ref>{{cite web | author=Chad Grisschow | publisher=IGN | year= 2006 | url=http://au.music.ign.com/articles/740/740065p1.html | title=Heads Will Roll: Glossy hard rock, Norwegian style |accessdate=2007-3-27}}</ref> Sixx also praised Raven, he said, "I<U+2019>ve written with artists as diverse as Joey from [[Saliva (band)]] to [[Meat Loaf]] and [[Vince Neil]], but Marion is the most talented new artist I<U+2019>ve worked with since I<U+2019>ve been making music."<ref>{{cite web | author=Culture | publisher=Norway-Culture | year= 2007 | url=http://www.norway.org/culture/music/Marion+Raven+at+Madison+Square+Garden.htm | title=Nikki Sixx praises Marion Raven |accessdate=2007-3-29}}</ref>
