'''''The Dark Side of the Moon''''' is the eighth [[studio album]] by English [[progressive rock]] band [[Pink Floyd]], released in March 1973.  It built on ideas explored in the band's earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968 of founder member, principal composer and lyricist, [[Syd Barrett]].  ''The Dark Side of the Moon''{{'}}s themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.

The suite was developed during live performances and was premiered several months before studio recording began.  The new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.  The group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including [[multitrack recording]] and [[tape loop]]s.  [[Analog synthesizer|Analogue synthesiser]]s were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of recorded interviews with the band's road crew and others provided the philosophical quotations used throughout. [[Audio engineering|Engineer]] [[Alan Parsons]] was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, and  the recruitment of [[Non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical]] performer [[Clare Torry]].  The album's iconic sleeve features a prism that represents the band's stage lighting, the record's lyrical themes, and [[keyboardist]] [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]'s request for a "simple and bold" design.

''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was an immediate success, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes]] chart for one week.  It subsequently remained in the charts for 741&nbsp;weeks from 1973 to 1988.  With an estimated 50 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums worldwide]].  It has twice been [[Audio mastering|remastered]] and re-released, and has been covered in its entirety by several other acts.  It spawned two singles, "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]" and "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]".  In addition to its commercial success, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.

==Background==
Following the release of ''[[Meddle]]'' in 1971, the band assembled for an upcoming tour of Britain, Japan, and the United States in December of that year.  Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album, although their priority at that time was the creation of new material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=71<U+2013>72}}</ref> In a band meeting at drummer [[Nick Mason]]'s home in [[Camden Town|Camden]], bassist [[Roger Waters]] proposed that a new album could form part of the tour.  Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=165}}</ref><ref name="darkside30">{{Citation |last=Harris | first=John | title='Dark Side' at 30: Roger Waters | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937470/dark_side_at_30_roger_waters | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090326023152/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937470/dark_side_at_30_roger_waters | archivedate = 26 March 2009 | publisher = rollingstone.com | date=12 March 2003 | accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>  The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's ''[[The Man and The Journey]]''.<ref name="Mabbett">{{Harvnb|Mabbett|1995|p=n/a}}</ref>  In an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', guitarist [[David Gilmour]] said:

Generally, all four members agreed that Waters' concept of an album unified by a single theme was a good idea.<ref name="gilmour"/>  Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright participated in the writing and [[Record producer|production]] of the new material, and Waters created the early [[Demo (music)|demo tracks]] at his [[Islington]] home in a small recording studio he had built in his garden shed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=166}}</ref>  Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of "[[Breathe (Pink Floyd song)|Breathe]]" came from an earlier work by Waters and [[Ron Geesin]], written for the soundtrack of ''[[Music from The Body|The Body]]'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=73<U+2013>74}}</ref> and the basic structure of "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" was taken from a piece originally composed by Wright for the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.<ref name="makingof">{{Citation | title = Classic Albums: The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon | format = DVD | publisher = Eagle Rock Entertainment | date = 26 August 2003 }}</ref>  The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by [[The Rolling Stones]], and then at the [[Rainbow (London)|Rainbow Theatre]].

The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version, and the recorded version released a year later, included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as "[[On the Run (instrumental)|On the Run]]", and [[Bible]] readings that were later replaced by [[Clare Torry]]'s [[Vocalise|non-lexical vocables]] on "[[The Great Gig in the Sky]]".<ref name="Poveyp155"/>

The band's [[Dark Side of the Moon Tour|lengthy tour]] through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of their performances.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=159}}</ref>  Studio sessions were scheduled between tour dates; rehearsals began in England on 20&nbsp;January 1972, but in late February the band travelled to France and recorded music for French director [[Barbet Schroeder]]'s film, ''[[La Vall<U+00E9>e (film)|La Vall<U+00E9>e]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=168}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|This material was later released under the title ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]''.<ref name="Poveyp155"/>|group="nb"}}  They then performed in [[Japan]] and returned to France in March to complete work on the film.  After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording the album, from 24&nbsp;May to 25&nbsp;June.  More concerts in Europe and North America followed before the band returned on 9&nbsp;January 1973 to complete work on the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=157}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|pp=164<U+2013>173}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=60}}</ref>

==Concept==
''The Dark Side of the Moon'' built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions which, according to critic [[David Fricke]], had become characteristic of the band after founder member Syd Barrett left in 1968.  Guitarist David Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as "that psychedelic noodling stuff", and with Waters cited 1971's ''[[Meddle]]'' as a turning-point towards what would be realised on the album.  ''The Dark Side of the Moon'''s lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death, and insanity, the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state; he had been the band's principal composer and lyricist.<ref name="makingof"/>  The album is notable for its use of [[musique concr<U+00E8>te]]<ref name="Mabbett" /> and conceptual, philosophical lyrics, as found in much of the band's other work.

Each side of the album is a continuous piece of music.  The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience, and (according to Waters) "empathy".<ref name="makingof"/>  "[[Speak to Me]]" and "Breathe" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life<U+2014>"Don't be afraid to care".<ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|pp=105<U+2013>106}}</ref>  By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental "On the Run" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=78<U+2013>79}}</ref>  "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focussed on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in "[[Breathe (Reprise)]]".  The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist [[Clare Torry]]'s soulful metaphor for death, "The Great Gig in the Sky".<ref name="Mabbett"/>  Opening with the sound of [[cash register]]s and loose change, the first track on side two, "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]", mocks greed and [[consumerism]] using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related [[sound effect]]s (ironically, "Money" has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands).<ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=111}}</ref>  "[[Us and Them (song)|Us and Them]]" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of [[emotional conflict|conflict]] and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. "[[Any Colour You Like]]" concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" looks at a [[mental illness]] resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line "and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes" reflects the mental breakdown of former band-mate Syd Barrett.  The album ends with "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]", which espouses the concepts of [[alterity]] and unity, while forcing the listener to recognise the common traits shared by humanity.<ref name="Reisingpp181184">{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=181<U+2013>184}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Whiteley|1992|p=116}}</ref>

==Recording==
[[File:Abbey Rd Studios.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph|The main entrance to [[Abbey Road Studios]]]]
The album was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]], in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973.  The band were assigned staff engineer [[Alan Parsons]], who had worked as assistant tape operator on ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'', and who had also gained experience as a recording engineer on [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=171}}</ref><ref name="anotherphase">{{Citation | title = Another Phase of the Moon page 1 | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/article/another-phase-moon | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = May 2003 | accessdate =20 March 2012}}</ref>  The recording sessions made use of some of the most advanced studio techniques of the time; the studio was capable of [[Multitrack recording|16-track]] mixes, which offered a greater degree of flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes they had previously used, although the band often used so many tracks that to make more space available second-generation copies were made.<ref name="Harrispp101102">{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=101<U+2013>102}}</ref>

Beginning on 1&nbsp;June, the first track to be recorded was "Us and Them", followed six days later by "Money".  Waters had created [[Sound effect|effects]] [[Tape loop|loops]] from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders).<ref name="anotherphase"/>  "Time" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" were the next pieces to be recorded, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=103<U+2013>108}}</ref>  The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of [[Arsenal F.C.]], would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point.<ref name="Harrispp101102"/>  Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: "We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on."<ref>{{Citation | title = There is no dark side of the moon, really&nbsp;...| url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/23/1056220536301.html | last = Waldon | first = Steve | publisher = theage.com | date = 24 June 2003 | accessdate =19 March 2009}}</ref><ref name="parsons">{{Citation | last= Harris | first = John |title='Dark Side' at 30: Alan Parsons |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937469/dark_side_at_30_alan_parsons  | publisher = rollingstone.com, hosted at web.archive.org |date=12 March 2003 |accessdate=31 May 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624053706/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/articles/story/5937469/dark_side_at_30_alan_parsons |archivedate = 24 June 2008}}</ref>

[[File:EMS VCS 3.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Photograph|The [[EMS VCS 3]] (Putney) synthesiser]]
Returning from the US in January 1973, they recorded "Brain Damage", "Eclipse", "[[Any Colour You Like]]" and "On the Run", while fine-tuning the work they had already laid down in the previous sessions.  A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on "Brain Damage", "Eclipse" and "Time", and saxophonist [[Dick Parry]] was booked to play on "Us and Them" and "Money".  With director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=158}}</ref>  Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=109<U+2013>114}}</ref>

===Instrumentation===
The album is particularly notable for the metronomic sound effects during "Speak to Me", and the tape loops that open "Money".  Mason created a rough version of "Speak to Me" at his home, before completing it in the studio.  The track serves as an [[overture]] and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album.  A piano chord, replayed backwards, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of "Breathe".  Mason received a rare solo composing credit for "Speak to Me".{{#tag:ref|Mason is responsible for most of the sound effects used on Pink Floyd's discography.|group="nb"}}<ref name="Schaffnerp164"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=172}}</ref>  The sound effects on "Money" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were used to create a [[beat (music)|7-beat]] [[tape loop|effects loop]] (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a "walk around the room" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album).<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=104<U+2013>105}}</ref>  At times the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled [[multitrack recording]]s of several of the songs (particularly "On the Run").<ref name="makingof"/>

Along with the conventional [[rock music|rock]] band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent [[synthesizer|synthesiser]]s to their sound.  For example, the band experimented with an [[EMS VCS 3]] on "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" and "Any Colour You Like", and a [[EMS Synthi A|Synthi A]] on "Time" and "On the Run".<!--VCS 3 and Synthi A are technically the same, only using different housings!-->  They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during "On the Run"),<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=118<U+2013>120}}</ref> and a specially treated [[bass drum]] made to simulate a human [[heart rate|heartbeat]] (during "Speak to Me", "On the Run", "Time", and "Eclipse").  This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on "Time", and "On the Run".<ref name="makingof"/>  The assorted clocks ticking then chiming simultaneously at the start of "Time", accompanied by a series of [[Rototom]]s, were initially created as a [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] test by Parsons.<ref name="Schaffnerp164">{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=164}}</ref>  The engineer recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop, and although his recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of the material were eventually used in the track.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=173}}</ref>

===Voices===
Several tracks, including "Us and Them" and "Time", demonstrate Richard Wright and David Gilmour's ability to harmonise their voices.  In the 2003 documentary ''[[Classic Albums: Pink Floyd <U+2013> The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon|The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sound extremely similar.  To take advantage of this, Parsons perfected the use of studio techniques such as the [[double tracking]] of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself.  Parsons also made prominent use of [[flanging]] and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with [[reverberation|reverb]],<ref name="makingof"/> and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the [[quadraphonic]] mix of "On the Run", when the sound of the [[Hammond organ#Console organs|Hammond B3]] organ played through a [[Leslie speaker]] rapidly swirls around the listener).<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=161}}</ref>

The album's credits include [[Clare Torry]], a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road.  She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on "The Great Gig in the Sky".  She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch [[Chuck Berry]] perform at the [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]], but arranged to come in on the following Sunday.  The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do.  Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Richard Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band<U+2014>only to find them delighted with her performance.<ref name="Blakepp198199">{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=198<U+2013>199}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=174}}</ref>  Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track.<ref name=gilmour/>  For her contribution she was paid <U+00A3>30, equivalent to about <U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|30|1972|r=-1}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}},<ref name="Blakepp198199"/>{{Inflation-fn|UK}} but in 2004 she sued [[EMI]] and Pink Floyd for song writing [[royalties]], arguing that she co-wrote "The Great Gig in the Sky" with keyboardist Richard Wright.  The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.<ref>{{Citation |title=Seventies Singer |url=http://www.freelanceuk.com/news/1006.shtml |publisher = freelanceuk.com | date=14 April 2005|accessdate=23 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Blake|2008|p=208}}</ref>  All post-2005 pressings therefore credit both Wright and Torry for the song.<ref name="Poveyp345">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=345}}</ref>

[[File:Clare torry.gif|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph|[[Clare Torry]] in 2003]]
Snippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album.  During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on [[flashcards]].  The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened studio&nbsp;three,<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=175}}</ref> and shown such questions as "What's your favourite colour?" and "What's your favourite food?", before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death).  Questions such as "When was the last time you were violent?", followed immediately by "Were you in the right?", were answered in the order they were presented.<ref name="makingof"/> Roger "The Hat" Manifold proved difficult to find, and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid.

===Completion===
Following the completion of the dialogue sessions, producer [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] was hired to provide "a fresh pair of ears".  Thomas' background was in music, rather than engineering.  He had worked with Beatles producer [[George Martin]], and was acquainted with Pink Floyd's manager [[Steve O'Rourke]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=177}}</ref>  All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a "dry" and "clean" mix which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler and more "echoey" mix.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=178}}</ref>  Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating "There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo.  In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out.  It was a very creative atmosphere.  A lot of fun."<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=135}}</ref>  Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas' intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product.  Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on "Us and Them".  He was also present for the recording of "The Great Gig in the Sky" (although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry).<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=134<U+2013>140}}</ref>  Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Waters said:

{{Quote|When the record was finished I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, "This has obviously struck a chord somewhere", and I was kinda pleased by that.  You know when you've done something, certainly if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else.  And at that point I thought to myself, "Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work", and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.<ref name="Billboard"/>}}

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=It felt like the whole band were working together.  It was a creative time.  We were all very open.|source=<U+2013>Richard Wright<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=3}}</ref>|align=right|width=33%}}
The album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by [[Hipgnosis]] and [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]].  Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]'' and ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'', as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers [[Storm Thorgerson]] and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something "smarter, neater<U+2014>more classy".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|p=143}}</ref>  The prism design was inspired by a photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a brainstorming session with Powell.

The artwork was created by their associate, George Hardie.  Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The design represents three elements; the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Richard Wright's request for a "simple and bold" design.<ref name="makingof"/>  The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold<U+2014>an idea that Waters came up with.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|pp=165<U+2013>166}}</ref>  Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops.<ref name="Harrispp141147">{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=141<U+2013>147}}</ref>  The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing [[indigo]] compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.  (An actual [[prism (optics)|prism]] would exhibit a [[visible spectrum|continuous spectrum]] with no defined boundaries between colours, and [[Prism (optics)#How prisms work|colour separation would be present inside the prism.]]) Inside the sleeve were two posters and several pyramid-themed stickers.  One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an [[Infrared photography|infrared photograph]] of the [[Giza Necropolis|Great Pyramids of Giza]], created by Powell and Thorgerson.<ref name="Harrispp141147"/>

Since the departure of founder member Barrett in 1968, the burden of lyrical composition had fallen mostly on Waters' shoulders.<ref name="Masonp167">{{Harvnb|Mason|2005|p=167}}</ref>  He is therefore credited as the author of the album's lyrics, making ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited only to him.<ref name="sleeve notes">{{Citation | title = Pink Floyd&nbsp;<U+2014>Dark Side of the Moon&nbsp;<U+2014>sleeve notes | publisher = TRO Hampshire House Publishing Corp. | year = 1973}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The sleeve notes for ''Wish You Were Here'', ''Animals'', and ''The Wall'' credit Roger Waters as sole lyricist.

{{Quote|That's crap.  There's no question that Dave needs a vehicle to bring out the best of his guitar playing.  And he is a great guitar player.  But the idea which he's tried to propagate over the years that he's somehow more musical than I am is absolute fucking nonsense.  It's an absurd notion but people seem quite happy to believe it.<ref name="darkside30"/>{{#tag:ref|Gilmour's comments on this matter may be found on page 7 of John Harris' book.|group="nb"}}&nbsp;}}

===Label===
Much of the album's early State-side success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, [[Capitol Records]].  Newly appointed chairman [[Bhaskar Menon]] set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's 1971 studio album ''Meddle''.  Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with [[CBS]] president [[Clive Davis]], on [[Columbia Records]].  ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was the last album that Pink Floyd were obliged to release before formally signing a new contract.  Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of "Us and Them" and "Time".<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=158<U+2013>161}}</ref>  In some countries<U+2014>notably the UK<U+2014>Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's "[[Point Me at the Sky]]", and unusually "Money" was released as a single on 7&nbsp;May,<ref name="Poveyp175">{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=175}}</ref> with "[[Any Colour You Like]]" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].

===Reissues and remastering===
In 1979, ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was released as a remastered [[LP album|LP]] by [[Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab]],<ref>{{Citation | title = MFSL Out of Print Archive&nbsp;<U+2013> Original Master Recording LP | url = http://www.mofi.com/store/pc/oop_archive/omrlp.htm | publisher = mofi.com | accessdate =20 March 2012}}</ref> and in April 1988 on their "Ultradisc" gold CD format.<ref>{{Citation | title = MFSL Out of Print Archive&nbsp;<U+2013> Ultradisc II Gold CD | url = http://www.mofi.com/store/pc/oop_archive/goldcd.htm | publisher = mofi.com | accessdate =20 March 2012}}</ref>  The album was released by EMI on the then-new [[Compact Disc|compact disc]] format in 1984, and eight years later it was re-released as a remastered CD in the box set ''[[Shine On (Pink Floyd)|Shine On]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Povey|2007|p=353}}</ref>  This version was re-released as a 20th-anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year.  The cover design was again by Storm Thorgerson, the designer of the original 1973 cover.<ref name="SACDcover"/>  A suggestion that on later CD pressings a faintly audible orchestral version of [[The Beatles]]'s "[[Ticket to Ride]]" can be heard after "Eclipse", over the album's closing heartbeats, may be due to a remastering error.<ref name="Poveyp345"/>

The original quadraphonic mix,{{#tag:ref|Harvest Q4SHVL-804|group="nb"}} though commissioned by [[EMI]], was never endorsed by the band,<ref name="anotherphase"/> but to celebrate the album's 30th anniversary an updated surround version was released in 2003.  Some surprise was expressed when the band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead chose to have their current engineer [[James Guthrie (record producer)|James Guthrie]] create a new [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]]&nbsp;channel surround sound mix on the [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] format.<ref name="anotherphase"/><ref>{{Citation | title = Tales from the Dark Side | url = http://www.soundandvisionmag.com/features/2003/05/tales-dark-side | last = Richardson | first = Ken | publisher = soundandvisionmag.com | date = 2003<U+2013>06 | accessdate =19 March 2009}}</ref>  Guthrie has worked with the band since co-producing and engineering their 1979 release, ''[[The Wall]]'', and had previously worked on surround versions of ''The Wall'' for DVD-Video, and Waters' ''In the Flesh'' for SACD.  Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was "possibly a little too true to the original mix", but was generally complimentary to the release.<ref name="anotherphase"/>

Referring to "On the Run", Parsons said: "After hearing his mix for a while, I think I'm hearing stereo with a bit of surround."  He praised the mix for other songs, particularly "The Great Gig in the Sky": "I tip my hat to James for sorting out the correct bits of Clare's vocals.  And he has improved on the stereo mix, which is a bit wishy-washy.  The stereo is heavy on the Hammond organ, and Clare's a little too far down.  In my quad mix, the Hammond is barely there, which shows you I really wasn't being faithful to the stereo mix.  The quad sounds pretty good, but James still has the edge.

The idea is derived from the "sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound&nbsp;..."

==Legacy==
The success of the album brought previously unknown wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=164<U+2013>166}}</ref>  Some of the profits were invested in the production of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parker|O'Shea|2006|pp=50<U+2013>51}}</ref>  Engineer Alan Parsons received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical|Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical]] for ''The Dark Side of the Moon'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=163}}</ref> and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist.  Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harris|2006|pp=173<U+2013>174}}</ref>  In 2003, Parsons reflected: "I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on ''Dark Side of the Moon'', which has an element of truth to it.  But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't."<ref name="parsons"/>{{#tag:ref|Alan Parsons was paid a weekly wage of <U+00A3>35 while working on the original album.<ref>{{Citation | title = Inlay notes on The Alan Parsons Project | work = Tales of Mystery and Imagination}}</ref>|group="nb"}}

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=It's changed me in many ways, because it's brought in a lot of money, and one feels very secure when you can sell an album for two years.  But it hasn't changed my attitude to music.  Even though it was so successful, it was made in the same way as all our other albums, and the only criterion we have about releasing music is whether we like it or not.  It was not a deliberate attempt to make a commercial album.  It just happened that way.  We knew it had a lot more melody than previous Floyd albums, and there was a concept that ran all through it.  The music was easier to absorb and having girls singing away added a commercial touch that none of our records had.|source=<U+2013>Richard Wright<ref>{{Harvnb|Dallas|1987|pp=107<U+2013>108}}</ref>|align=right|width=33%}}
''The Dark Side of the Moon'' frequently appears on rankings of the greatest albums of all-time.

Part of the legacy of ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' is in its influence on modern music, the musicians who have performed [[cover version]]s of its songs, and even in modern urban myths.  Its release is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes drawn between Pink Floyd and [[Radiohead]]<U+2014>specifically their 1997 album ''[[OK Computer]]''<U+2014>which has been called ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' for the 1990s whereby the two albums share a common theme: the loss of a creative individual's ability to function in the modern world.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|pp=208<U+2013>211}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Griffiths|2004|p=109}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Buckley|2003|p=843}}</ref>

===Dark Side of the Rainbow===
{{Main|Dark Side of the Rainbow}}
Dark Side of the Rainbow and Dark Side of Oz are two names commonly used in reference to rumours circulated on the Internet since at least 1994 that ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' was written as a soundtrack for the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] beginning to jog at the lyric "no one told you when to run" during "Time", and Dorothy balancing on a [[tight-rope]] fence during the line "balanced on the biggest wave" in "Breathe".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=57}}</ref>  David Gilmour and Nick Mason have both denied a connection between the two works, and Roger Waters has described the rumours as "amusing".<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=59}}</ref> Alan Parsons has stated that the film was not mentioned during production of the album.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reising|2005|p=70}}</ref>
