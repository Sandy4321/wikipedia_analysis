==Plot==
''Never Better'' is about Keith Merchant (Mangan), a recovering alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life never seems to get better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied with his own flaws. He attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug ([[Christopher Fairbank]]). He has a family, with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts to be a good husband and father, his optimism for his family and attempts to do the right thing tend to lead to even more problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when he was drinking.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/neverbetter/|title=Never Better|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/news/news.php?story=000335|title=News - Details on the new BBC2 sitcoms for 2008|publisher=British Sitcom Guide|date=2007-11-20|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>

==Production==
The series is written by Fintan Ryan, produced by Helen Gregory and directed by Martin Dennis.<ref name="BBC"/> The series itself is made by production company World Productions. Mangan and Ashfield had previously worked together early in their careers, providing voices for an animated series of ''[[Watership Down]]''. Ashfield claimed that on set, "struggled to keep a straight face most of the time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=244367&command=displayContent&sourceNode=244365&contentPK=19571050&folderPk=112383&pNodeId=188965|title=Kate laughs through sitcom|publisher=Nottingham Evening Post|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref> She also said that her part made her more aware of her health. She said in an interview with ''The Times'' that she hoped the show would make, "people think twice about binge drinking." When asked if the role made her more [[Wiktionary:abstemious|abstemious]], she said, "I watch what I drink and I try to keep myself healthy."<ref>{{cite news|last=Austin|first=Jeremy|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article3171708.ece|title=How the fit and fabulous stay that way: naturally good-looking|publisher=The Times|date=2008-01-12|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>

Mangan has said that he did not attend any AA meetings as part of research saying, "I didn't feel I could sit there and pretend to be an alcoholic, I thought that would be wrong. I also didn't want to stand up and say 'Hi, my name's Stephen, I'm an actor in a sitcom.' These are places where people are trying to work out really difficult stuff. We do touch on some controversial subjects in the series; there's a lad with [[Down syndrome]] in one episode. There's all sorts of topics that you wouldn't initially think are comic issues."<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a87011/stephen-mangan.html|title=Stephen Mangan|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2008-01-23|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Never Better'' has been described as a dark sitcom. It has been compared to similar sitcoms such as ''[[Lead Balloon]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.<ref name="Guardian"/><ref name="Scotsman"/> David Belcher in ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' commented on the show positively writing about the lack of a [[laughter track]] and the show's making fun of controversial subjects such as [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Belcher|first=David|url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/lastnighttv/display.var.1993017.0.Proof_that_nothings_sacred_any_more.php|title=Proof that nothing<U+2019>s sacred any more|publisher=The Herald|date=2008-01-22|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref>

However, people criticised ''Never Better'' for being too similar to other sitcoms and it received poor reviews overall. Paul Hoggart wrote in ''[[The Times]]'' that, "It is amiably amusing, but may suffer from comparison with last year's ''[[Outnumbered]]'', which covered similar ground with superb dexterity."<ref name="Times"/> One critic from the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' said, "Stephen Mangan's latest incarnation as recovering alcoholic Keith doesn't land with the same weight as Steve Coogan's Tommy Saxondale [from ''[[Saxondale]]''] or Jack Dee's Rick Spleen [from ''Lead Balloon'']."<ref name="Mirror"/>

[[A. A. Gill]] disliked the show, writing in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that, "''Never Better'' (Thursday, BBC2) is so poor, so comically bereft, so rigorously scoured of charm, traction, humour or insight, that seeing that whichever sad sap wrote it couldn't be bothered to include an original syllable, neither can I. In America, the aspirational sitcom has, as is its nature, successfully progressed to become ''[[Friends]]'' and ''[[Sex and the City]]'', ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'', ''[[Frasier]]'', ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. The recipe for success is simple: more of everything <U+2013> more care, more commitment, more writers working harder to higher standards, with more discipline, for more money, with a collective understanding of what the genre stands for and, crucially, a belief that it has merit."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gill|first=A. A.|authorlink=A. A. Gill|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article3160817.ece|title=A Close encounter of the best kind|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=2008-01-13|accessdate=2008-01-13}}</ref>

Gerard O'Donovan in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' also attacked the programme. After the second episode had been broadcast, he wrote that, "Sadly, what modest potential the show evinced last week had evaporated in the interim. Recovering alcoholic Keith was again suffering from acute vagueness. Which was fine. But he also seemed to have lost his few remaining booze-free brain cells because he kept getting into scrapes as a result of not being able to use a mobile phone properly. If he'd been [[Victor Meldrew]] [from ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''], or a man of that generation, this might have been just about credible. But for an educated man in his thirties it was risible and came across as contrived beyond belief. A paper-thin character to begin with, with no job, no friends and no real personality to speak of, Keith was now entirely transparent, revealed as a mere vehicle for lazy situation comedy. Not even Mangan could rescue that."<ref name="DT"/>

The series attracted poor ratings. The third episode, broadcast on 24 January 2008, received 900,000 viewers, the lowest of the five main [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] that day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jan/25/tvratings.television|title=TV ratings - January 24|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> The following two episodes broadcast on 31 January and 7 February received 800,000 viewers (4% of the audience).<ref>{{cite news|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/01/tvratings.television|title=TV ratings - January 31|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-02-01|accessdate=2008-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/feb/08/tvratings.television|title=TV ratings - February 7|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-02-08|accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> The final episode had 823,000 viewers. This resulted in the series attracting an average audience of 935,000. In comparison, ''[[Little Miss Jocelyn]]'', the programme that was broadcast immediately before ''Never Better'' over the same six weeks on BBC Two, attracted an average of 1.1 million viewers.<ref name="Chortle"/>
