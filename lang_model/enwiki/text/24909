[[Image:WW2 Iwo Jima flag raising.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima'', by [[Joe Rosenthal]] / [[The Associated Press]]]]

'''''Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima''''' is an iconic photograph taken on [[February 23]], [[1945]] by [[Joe Rosenthal]]. It depicts five [[United States Marines]] and a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[corpsman]] raising the [[Flag of the United States]] atop [[Mount Suribachi]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]]. The photograph was instantly popular, being reprinted in hundreds of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]] in the same year as its publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images in history, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.<ref name="ap">[http://www.ap.org/pages/about/pulitzer/rosenthal.html Fifty Years Later, Iwo Jima Photographer Fights His Own Battle]</ref> Of the six men depicted in the picture, three ([[Franklin Sousley]], [[Harlon Block]], and [[Michael Strank]]) did not survive the battle; the three survivors ([[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]], [[Rene Gagnon]], and [[Ira Hayes]]) became suddenly famous. The photograph was later used by [[Felix de Weldon]] to sculpt the [[USMC War Memorial]], located just outside [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Background==
{{main|Battle of Iwo Jima}}

On [[February 19]], [[1945]], as part of their [[island hopping]] strategy to defeat [[Japan]], the [[United States]] invaded [[Iwo Jima]]. Iwo Jima was originally not a target, but the relatively quick fall of the [[Philippines]] left the Americans with a greater-than-expected lull prior to the planned [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. Iwo Jima is located half-way between Japan and the [[Mariana Islands]], where American long-range bombers were based, and was used by the Japanese as an [[early warning station]], [[radio]]ing warnings of incoming American bombers to the Japanese homeland. The Americans, after capturing the island, deprived the Japanese of their early warning system, and used it as an [[emergency landing]] strip for damaged bombers, saving many American lives.<ref>Weinberg, Gerhard L. A World At Arms, pg 866-868</ref>

[[Image:MtSuribachi2.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Mount Suribachi]] is the dominant geographical feature of [[Iwo Jima]].]]

Iwo Jima is a [[volcanism|volcanic]] island, shaped like a [[trapezoid]]. The island was heavily fortified, and the invading American marines suffered extremely high casualties&mdash;it was the only invasion of the American offensive in the [[Pacific]] war in which the Americans suffered higher casualties than the Japanese. The island is dominated by [[Mount Suribachi]], a 546&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|foot]] (166&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) [[dormant]] [[volcanic cone]] situated on the southern tip of the island. Politically, the island is part of the [[prefecture]] of [[Tokyo]]&mdash;the [[mayor]] of Tokyo is the mayor of Iwo Jima. It would be the first Japanese homeland soil to be captured by the Americans, and it was a matter of honor for the Japanese to prevent its capture.

Strategically, the top of Suribachi is one of the most important locations on the island. From that vantage point, the Japanese defenders were able to accurately [[artillery spotting|spot artillery]] onto the Americans - particularly the landing beaches. The Japanese fought most of the battle from underground [[bunker]]s and [[pillbox]]es. It was not uncommon for marines to knock out one pillbox using [[grenade]]s or a [[flamethrower]], only to have it begin shooting again a few minutes later after more Japanese infantry slipped into the pillbox using a tunnel. The American effort concentrated on isolating and capturing Suribachi first, a goal that was achieved on [[February 23]], [[1945]], four days after the battle began.  Despite capturing Suribachi, the battle continued to rage for many days, and the island would not be declared "secure" until 31 days later, on [[26 March]] [[1945]].

==Raising the Flag==
The famous picture taken by Rosenthal actually captured the second flag-raising event of the day. A U.S. flag was first raised atop Suribachi soon after it was captured early in the morning of [[23 February]] [[1945]]. [[Captain]] Dave E. Severance, the commander of Easy Company (2nd Battalion, 28th Regiment, [[U.S. 5th Marine Division]]), ordered [[Lieutenant]] Harold G. Schrier to take a patrol to raise an American flag at the summit to signal to others that it had fallen.  After a fire-fight, a 54-by-28&nbsp;[[inch]] (137-by-71 cm) flag was raised, and photographed by [[Staff Sergeant]] [[Louis R. Lowery]], a photographer with [[Leatherneck magazine]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003131-00/sec4a.htm#flag CLOSING IN: Marines in the Seizure of Iwo Jima], by Colonel Joseph H. Alexander, USMC (Retired), 1994, from the [[National Park Service]].</ref> <ref>[http://www.iwojima.com/raising/lflagi.gif Picture of the first flag raising]</ref> <ref>[http://www.nps.gov/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003131-00/index.htm Image of the first flag being lowered as the second flag is raised], Department of Defense Photo (USMC) 112718.</ref> However, the first flag raised by the Marines was too small to be seen easily from the nearby landing beaches.

<blockquote>"The [[Secretary of the Navy]], [[James Forrestal]], had decided the previous night that he wanted to go ashore and witness the final stage of the fight for the mountain. Now, under a stern commitment to take order from [[Holland Smith|Howlin' Mad Smith]], the secretary was churning ashore in the company of the blunt, earthy general. Their boat touched the beach just after the flag went up, and the mood among the high command turned jubilant. Gazing upward, at the red, white, and blue speck, Forrestal remarked to Smith: 'Holland, the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years'."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Forrestal was so taken with fervor of the moment that he decided he wanted the Suribachi flag as a souvenir. The news of this wish did not sit well with [2nd Battalion Commander] Chandler Johnson, whose temperament was every bit as fiery as Howlin Mad's. 'To hell with that!' the colonel spat when the message reached him. The flag belonged to the battalion, as far as Johnson was concerned. He decided to secure it as soon as possible, and dispatched his assistant operations officer, Lieutenant Ted Tuttle, to the beach to scare up a replacement flag. As an afterthought, Johnson called after Tuttle 'And make it a bigger one'".<ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.207</ref></blockquote>

Michael Strank, Harlon Block, Ira Hayes, and Franklin Sousley spent the morning of the 23rd laying a [[telephone]] wire to the top of Suribachi, on orders from [[Colonel]] Chandler Johnson, passed on by Captain Severance. Severance also dispatched Rene Gagnon, a [[runner]], to the command post for fresh [[SCR-300]] batteries. Meanwhile, according to the official Marine Corps history, Tuttle had found a flag in nearby [[LST]] 779, made his way back to the command post, and gave it to Johnson. Johnson, in turn, gave it to Gagnon with orders to take it back up Suribachi and raise it.<ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.210</ref> The official Marine Corps history of the event is that Tuttle received the flag from ensign Alan Wood of LST 779, who in turn had received the flag from a supply depot in [[Pearl Harbor]]. However, the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Historian<U+2019>s Office supports claims made by Robert Resnick, who served aboard LST 758. "Before he died in November 2004, Resnick said Gagnon came aboard LST-758 the morning of Feb. 23 looking for a flag. Resnick said he grabbed one from a bunting box and asked permission from commanding officer Lt. Felix Molenda to donate it. Resnick kept quiet about his participation until 2001." <ref>[http://www.armytimes.com/story.php?f=1-292308-1408901.php Iwo Jima flag legend puts services at odds]</ref>

[[Image:Raising of the flag - colored.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|A version of the photo [[colorization|colorized]] to indicate the six men who raised the flag&mdash;[[Ira Hayes]] (red), [[Franklin Sousley]] (violet), [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]] (green), [[Harlon Block]] (yellow), [[Michael Strank]] (brown), [[Rene Gagnon]] (teal).]]

The marines reached the top of the mountain around noon, where Gagnon joined them. Despite the large numbers of Japanese troops in the immediate vicinity, the 40-man patrol made it to the top of the mountain without being fired at once, as the Japanese were under bombardment at the time. <ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq87-3l.htm US Naval Historical Center - Recollections of the flag raising on Mount Suribachi by John Bradley]</ref> 

Rosenthal, along with marine photographers Bob Campbell and [[Bill Genaust]] (who was killed in action nine days after the flag raising)<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/ca4/gunnyg/themanweleftbehind.html The Man We Left Behind - Sgt Bill Genaust USMC-Iwo Jima 1945]</ref> was climbing Suribachi at this time. On the way up, the trio met Lowery (the man who photographed the first flag raising). They had been considering turning around, but Lowery told them that the summit was an excellent vantage point from which to take pictures. 

Along with Navy corpsman Bradley, the marines raised the U.S. flag using an old Japanese water pipe for a flagpole. Rosenthal's trio reached the summit as the marines were attaching the flag to the pipe. Rosenthal put down his [[Speed Graphic]] camera (which was set to 1/400th of a second [[shutter speed]], with the [[f-stop]] between 8 and 16) on the ground so he could pile rocks to stand on for a better vantage point. In doing so, he nearly missed the shot. Realizing he had was about to miss it, Rosenthal quickly swung his camera up and snapped the photograph without using the [[viewfinder]]. <ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.209-211</ref>

Bill Genaust, who was standing almost shoulder-to-shoulder with Rosenthal about thirty yards from the flag raising, was shooting motion-picture [[film]] during the flag-raising. His film also captures the flag raising at an almost-identical angle to Rosenthal's famous shot.

Of the six men pictured&mdash;[[Michael Strank]], [[Rene Gagnon]], [[Ira Hayes]], [[Franklin Sousley]], [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]] (the Navy corpsman), and [[Harlon Block]]&mdash;only three (Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley) survived the battle.

==Publication and staging controversy==
Following the flag raising, Rosenthal sent his film to [[Guam]] to be developed and printed. <ref>[http://www.manythings.org/voa/03/030811ta_t.htm THIS IS AMERICA - The Iwo Jima Statue]</ref> Upon seeing it, [[Associated Press|AP]] photo editor John Bodkin exclaimed "Here's one for all time!" and immediately [[radiofax|radiophotoed]] the image to the AP headquarters in [[New York]] at seven A.M., [[Eastern War Time]]. <ref name="bradley220">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.220</ref> The photograph was picked up off the wire very quickly by hundreds of newspapers. It "was distributed by Associated Press within seventeen and one-half hours after Rosenthal shot it<U+2014>an astonishingly fast turnaround time in those days." <ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/supportut/news_pub/yg_iwojimaphoto.html Center for American History Receives Signed Print of Iwo Jima Photograph]</ref>

However, the photo was not without controversy. Following the second flag raising, Rosenthal had the Marines of Easy Company pose for a group shot, which he called the "[[gung-ho]]" shot. <ref>Rosenthal, Joe.  [http://www.iwojima.com/raising/l721flag.gif Posed "gung-ho" shot].  [[February 23]], [[1945]].</ref> This was also documented by Bill Genaust. <ref>Genaust, Bill.  [http://www.iwojima.com/raising/lflagj.gif Picture of Rosenthal taking the 'Gung-ho' shot].  [[February 23]], [[1945]].</ref> A few days after the picture was taken, back on Guam, Rosenthal was asked if he had posed the photo. Thinking the questioner was referring to the 'gung-ho' picture, he replied "Sure." After that, Robert Sherrod, a [[Time-Life]] correspondent, told his editors in New York that Rosenthal had staged the flag-raising photo.  [[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'s radio show, 'Time Views the News', broadcast a report, charging that "Rosenthal climbed Suribachi after the flag had already been planted... Like most photographers (he) could not resist reposing his characters in historic fashion." <ref name="ap"/>

As a result of this report, Rosenthal has repeatedly been accused of having staged the picture, or covering up the first flag raising. One New York Times book reviewer even went so far as to suggest revoking his Pulitzer Prize.<ref name="ap"/> For the decades that have followed, Rosenthal has repeatedly and vociferously refuted claims that the flag raising was staged. "I don't think it is in me to do much more of this sort of thing... I don't know how to get across to anybody what 50 years of constant repetition means." <ref name="ap"/> Genaust's film also shows the claim that the flag raising was staged to be erroneous.

==The 7th war bond drive and the sixth man controversy==
[[image:John Bradley.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]], who temporarily needed [[crutch]]es following the battle due to [[shrapnel]] injuries, appearing next to a poster for the 7th [[War bond]] drive]]

Upon seeing the photo, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] realized the picture would make an excellent symbol for the upcoming 7th [[war bond]] drive, and ordered the soldiers identified and brought home. The Marines were brought home at the conclusion of the battle. Using a photo enlargement, Rene Gagnon identified the others in the photograph but refused to identify the sixth man (Hayes), insisting he had promised to keep the man's name a secret.<ref name="History">[http://www.montney.com/marine/iwo.htm History of the Flag-Raising On Iwo Jima]</ref> Gagnon had promised not to discuss Hayes's identity only because Hayes&mdash;who despised Gagnon&mdash;had threatened to kill him.<ref name="bradley268">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.268</ref> After being brought to Marine Corps headquarters and informed that he was being ordered by the President to reveal the information, and that refusing an order to reveal the name would be a serious crime, Gagnon revealed Hayes's name. 

Gagnon also misidentified Harlon Block as Sergeant Henry O. "Hank" Hansen, who had not survived the battle (and who had, incidentally, participated in the first flag raising). On [[April 8]], [[1945]], the Marines Corp released the identification of five of the flag raisers (including Hansen)&mdash;Sousley's identity was withheld pending notification of his family of his death during the battle.

The three survivors went on a whirlwind bond tour. The tour was a smashing success, raising [[U.S. dollar|$]]23.3 billion, twice the tour's goal. <ref name="bradley294">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.294</ref>  

[[Image:Ira Hayes.jpg|right|thumbnail|175px|In late 1946, [[Ira Hayes]] broke his silence and revealed that [[Harlon Block]] had been misidentified as [[Hank Hansen]].]]

Questions lingered about the misidentification of Harlon Block. His mother, Belle Block, refused to accept the official identification, noting that she had "changed so many [[diaper]]s on that boy's [[Buttocks|butt]], I know it's my boy."<ref name="lecture">[http://www.webb-institute.edu/Alumni/bradley_lecture.php James J. Bradley lecture at the Webb Institute]</ref> Immediately on arrival in [[Washington, D.C.]] on [[April 19]], Hayes noticed the misidentification in the photo, and noted this to the Marine [[public relations]] officer who had been assigned to him. The public relations officer told Hayes that the identifications had already been officially released, and ordered Hayes to keep silent about it.<ref name="bradley275">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.275</ref> 

Over a year and a half later, amidst the [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[alcoholism]] that would characterize the rest of his life following the war, Ira Hayes [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] to [[Texas]] to inform Block's family that Block had, in fact, been the sixth flag raiser.<ref name="bradley312">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.312</ref> 

<blockquote> Ira remembered what Rene Gagnon and John Bradley could not have remembered, because they did not join the little cluster until the last moment: that it was Harlon [Block], Mike [Strank], Franklin [Sousley] and himself [Hayes] who had ascended Suribachi midmorning to lay telephone wire; it was Rene [Gagnon] who had come along with the replacement flag. Hansen had not been part of this action. <ref name="bradley274">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.274</ref></blockquote>

Block's mother, Belle, immediately composed a letter to her [[United States Congress|congressional]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] ([[Milton West]]) who forwarded the letter to [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Marine Corp Commandant]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]]. Vandergrift ordered an investigation. Both Bradley and Gagnon, upon being shown the evidence, agreed that it was probably Block and not Hansen.<ref name="bradley313">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.313</ref>

==Legacy==
Rosenthal's photo won the 1945 [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]], the first and only photograph to win the prize in the same year it was taken. Following publication of the photograph, "News pros were not the only ones bedazzled by the photo. Navy Captain T.B. Clark was on duty at [[Patuxent Air Station]] in [[Virginia]] that Saturday when it came humming off the wire. He studied it for a minute, and then thrust it under the gaze of Navy [[Petty Officer]] [[Felix de Weldon]]. DeWeldon was an Austrian immigrant schooled in European painting and sculpture.  De Weldon could not take his eyes off the photo. In its classic [[triangular lines]] he recognized similarities with the ancient statues he had studied. He reflexively reached for some [[sculptor's clay]] and tools. With the photograph before him he labored through the long night. By dawn, he had replicated the six boys pushing a pole, raising a flag."<ref name="bradley220"/> Starting in 1951, de Weldon was commissioned to design a memorial to the Marine Corp. It took De Weldon and hundreds of his assistants three years to finish it. The three survivors posed for DeWeldon, who used their faces as a model. The other three who did not survive were sculpted from pictures. <ref>[http://www.nps.gov/gwmp/usmc.htm USMC War Memorial].</ref> 

Most people are unaware that the flag raising Rosenthal photographed was the second that day. This led to resentment from those marines who took part in the nearly-forgotten first flag raising. Chuck Lindberg, who participated in the first flag raising (and who [[as of 2005]] is the last living person depicted in either flag raising <ref>[http://www.mediatechnics.com/iwo-jima-the-last-flag-raiser-dvd.php The Last Flag Raiser]</ref>) complained that he "was called a liar and everything else. It was terrible."

The photograph is currently in the possession of Roy H. Williams, who bought it from the estate of John Faber, the official historian for the [[National Press Photographers Association]], who had received it from Rosenthal. <ref>Williams, Roy.  [http://www.invisibleheroes.com/hero.asp?issue=108 "An Island in WWII"]. 2003.  Retrieved [[April 7]], [[2006]].</ref> Both flags (from the first and second flag raisings) are now located in the [[U.S. Marine Corps museum]] at the [[Washington Navy Yard|U.S. Navy Yard]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. <ref>[http://fotw.vexillum.com/flags/xf-famo.html#iwojima Famous Flags]</ref>

Following the war, plagued with depression brought on by [[survivor guilt]], Hayes became an alcoholic.  His tragic life was memorialized in the [[country music|country song]] "The Ballad of Ira Hayes", written by [[Peter LaFarge]] and recorded by [[Johnny Cash]] in 1964. [[Bob Dylan]] later [[cover version|covered]] the song, as did author and singer [[Kinky Friedman]]. The song notes that after the war, "Then Ira started drinkin' hard // Jail was often his home // They'd let him raise the flag and lower it // like you'd throw a dog a bone! // He died drunk one mornin' // Alone in the land he fought to save // Two inches of water in a lonely ditch //Was a grave for Ira Hayes." <ref>[http://www.toptown.com/hp/66/irahayes.htm The Ballad of Ira Hayes]</ref>

[[Image:John Bradley Memorial on Mt Suribachi.jpg|right|thumbnail|The plaque placed on [[Mount Suribachi]] by [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley's]] family, shaped like the state of [[Wisconsin]].]]

Following the war, Bradley was staunchly tight-lipped about his experiences, often deflecting questions by claiming he had forgotten. <ref name="bradley343">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.343</ref> During his 47 year marriage, he only talked about it with his wife Betty once, on their first date, and never again afterwards.<ref name="lecture"/> Within the family, it was considered a [[taboo]] subject. He gave exactly one interview, in 1985, at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren <ref name="bradley352">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.352</ref>. Following Bradley's death in 1994, his family went to Suribachi in 1997 and placed a plaque (made of [[Wisconsin]] [[granite]] and shaped like that state) on the spot where the flag raising took place. At the time of his death, Bradley's son, [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] knew almost nothing of his father's wartime experiences. <ref name="lecture"/> As a [[catharsis]], James Bradley spent four years interviewing the families of all the flag raisers, and  published ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', a definitive book on the flag raising and its participants. <ref name="bradley5">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.5</ref> This book has inspired a [[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|2006 movie of the same name]]. 

The Iwo Jima flag raising has been depicted in other films including 1949's ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' (in which the three surviving flag raisers make a [[cameo]] appearance at the end of the film) and 1961's ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'' (a biography of Ira Hayes starring [[Tony Curtis]]). 

Rosenthal's photograph has been reproduced in a number of other formats. It appeared on 3.5 million posters for the 7th war bond drive. <ref name="ap"/> In September 1945, the [[United States Post Office]] released a [[postage stamp]] bearing the image (despite a policy at the time of not featuring living people on stamps). For many years, it was the best selling stamp in the history of the US Post Office, eventually selling over 137 million. The stamp was re-released in 1995. <ref>[http://www.iwojima.com/stamps/index.htm Iwo Jima Stamps]</ref> The composition of the photo has since been replicated in other facets of popular culture &mdash; such as an appearance in the cover artwork for [[Terry Pratchett]]'s novel ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', and the logo of the [[NetBSD]] operating system from 1994 to 2004.

A similar photograph was taken by [[Thomas E. Franklin]] of the ''[[Bergen Record]]'' in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  Officially known as "Ground Zero Spirit", the photograph is perhaps better known as "[[Raising the Flag at Ground Zero]]", and shows three [[firefighter]]s raising a US flag in the ruins of the [[World Trade Center]] shortly after 5pm on [[September 11]], [[2001]].<ref>[http://www.groundzerospirit.org/ Official Bergen Record page on "Ground Zero Spirit"], [http://septterror.tripod.com/firephoto.html Story of the photo]</ref>
