In an interview with iTunes Radio, Knowles praised Furler's songwriting and commented that the second she heard the song, she knew she had to sing it.

I wanted to capture how humiliating and insecure that makes you feel."<ref name="SMH">{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/beyonce-praises-australian-songwriter-sia-20131218-2zlb1.html |title=Beyonce praises Australian songwriter Sia |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=December 19, 2013 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref>

However, Kara Brown of [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] describes the "***Flawless" lyrics which Hess mentions simply as a "hyperbole", noting how "[Knowles'] art is rooted in black womanhood<U+2014>celebrating and stomping, both figuratively and literally, on the systems and individuals that attempt to suppress it".<ref name="vice">{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Kara|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/beyonce-feminism-new-album|title=We Don't Need To Defend Beyonc<U+00E9>'s Feminism Anymore Because We Have 'Beyonc<U+00E9>'|publisher=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=December 17, 2013|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref> Similarly, Shannon Kelley for [[TakePart]] believed that whilst the irony of the video was evident, it showed that "[Knowles is] not immune to the disease" and the song "offers an honest commentary on an important reality".<ref name="takepart">{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Shannon|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/12/20/when-it-comes-girl-power-beyonce-important-feminism-oprah|title=Why Beyonc<U+00E9> Is as Important to Feminism as Oprah|publisher=[[TakePart]]|date=December 20, 2013|accessdate=December 26, 2013}}</ref>
