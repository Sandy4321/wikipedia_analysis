'''Chevelle''' is an American [[hard rock]] band that formed in 1995 in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The band was originally comprised of three brothers: Pete ([[Singer|lead vocals]]/guitar), Sam ([[Drum kit|drums]]/[[Percussion instrument|percussion]]), and Joe Loeffler ([[Bass guitar|bass]]/vocals). Joe left the band in 2005 and was replaced by Dean Bernardini soon after. Chevelle has sold nearly two million albums in the United States. Its second album, ''[[Wonder What's Next]]'', was certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]]. Since its formation, Chevelle has released four studio albums, one live album, and one DVD.

== History ==
=== Formation ===

Chevelle formed in 1995 in [[Grayslake, Illinois|Grayslake]], [[Illinois]] when the brothers [[Pete Loeffler]] and [[Sam Loeffler]] started enjoying music. Pete started playing guitar and singing while Sam began playing drums in their parents' garage. Soon after they began playing instruments, the two brothers asked their friend Matt Scott to play bass.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web| author=Frey, Tracy |url=http://wc02.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:hbfuxq9jld0e~T1 |title=Chevelle Biography - All Music Guide |publisher=''[[All Music Guide]]'' |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> Pete and Sam's youngest brother was interested in the band when he learned how to play bass. The two brothers enjoyed Joe's sound better than Scott's, leading to Scott departing the band and being replaced by Joe. The name Chevelle came from the band member's father's favorite car, the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]].<ref name="Christian music">{{cite web| url=http://www.christianmusic.com/chevelle/bio.html |title=Chevelle - Christianmusic.com |publisher=''Christian Music'' |accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> The band started playing small outdoor concerts and clubs around [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]] with Joe being only 14 years old.<ref name="AMG"/>

{{sample box end}}
Prior to the release of Chevelle's third full-length album ''[[This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In)]]'', the youngest of the brothers, the bassist Joe Loeffler, was dismissed from Chevelle. Due to different stories from the band members, it is unclear whether he was fired or left the band of his own accord. Pete and Sam stated the following on the band's official website: "After three years of non-stop touring and recording, Joe is taking a break to be home with family. We'll miss having him on the road with us, but as his brothers and bandmates we respect his decision and are looking forward to getting out there and playing for the fans. See you on tour."<ref name="Did Joe get fired">{{cite web| url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/chevelle_bassist_fired.html |title=Chevelle Bassist Fired? |date=[[2005-07-04]] |publisher=''Ultimate-guitar'' |accessdate=2007-12-24}}</ref> However, according to [[Ultimate Guitar Archive]], Joe said of his departure:

{{Quote|First off, very typical. This is exactly what I expected from them. Try and make it look like I didn't want to be in the band. I was fired plain and simple, in fact there wasn't even a discussion about it they just dropped it on me. I told them I would never quit and they would have to fire me. They were trying to get me to quit and told my managers that I did. I called Sam and said 'Why are you doing this?' and he said we don't want you to come back. I said I will not quit. The next day Pete called for the first time and said 'Did (our managers) call you and tell you your out?' I said 'No, were they supposed to?' he eventually said in that short conversation 'your {{sic}} fired'. I am insulted by the message on the front page of the site,(by the way, that's the first change to the site I've seen in at least a year!) it is completely false and out of line. I made no decision and am not taking a break. I will be working on getting a new job immediately. A break also means there's a chance to come back, and nothing could be farther from reality. I was fired and they have not said a word to me since. I would never ask to be back in (why would I want to after this?) and I never did in the past when I quit. 'We'll miss having him on the road with us'... Right.<ref name="Did Joe get fired"/>}}

In late 2006, Pete discussed his brother's departure on MTV.com:
{{Quote|People need to know that he quit many, many times before, and that [the last] time, he quit as well. He took a train home from Kansas City, Missouri, and the [rest of the] band flew home. And when we did get home, it was the same old thing <U+2014> Joe quit again. When he was confronted on it, he denied it, and we said, 'Well, too bad, because now, it's really over.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542925/20061011/chevelle.jhtml |title=Chevelle Frontman Opens Up About Bassist Brother's Exit |date=[[2006-10-12]] |publisher=''[[MTV]]'' |accessdate=2008-01-14}}</ref>}}

== Christianity controversy ==

Chevelle has caused controversy among Christian groups, because at one point they were on a Christian rock label, and thus the band has mistakenly been labeled "Christian rock." Kieth Miller of Evangelsociety.org has been critical of Chevelle due to the band touring on [[Ozzfest]] with bands such as [[Cradle of Filth]], who he claims incorporate strong satanic and anti-Christian themes into their lyrics.<ref name="Over-reacter">{{cite web| author=Miller, Kieth |date=[[2004-02-09]] |url=http://www.evangelsociety.org/miller/chevelle2.html |title=Chevelle's Uncertain Witness: |publisher=''Evangel Society'' |accessdate=2007-12-25}}</ref> Sam Loeffler said, "It<U+2019>s something that<U+2019>s probably going to follow us around forever and that<U+2019>s fine. It<U+2019>s pretty simple. We originally signed with a record company that was backed by [[Word Records|Word]], so the record [''Point #1''] was in Christian bookstores.

Chevelle have tried to distance themselves from a Christian identity, claiming that they are not a Christian band.
