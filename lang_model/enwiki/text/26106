'''USS ''President''''' was a nominally rated 44-gun wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]], three-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] heavy [[frigate]] of the [[United States Navy]]. She was named by [[George Washington]] to reflect a principle of the [[United States Constitution]]. Forman Cheeseman was in charge of her construction and she was launched in April 1800 from a shipyard in New York City. ''President'' was one of the [[original six frigates of the United States Navy|original six frigates]] whose construction the [[Naval Act of 1794]] had authorized, and she was the last to be completed. [[Joshua Humphreys]] designed these frigates to be the young Navy's [[capital ship]]s, and so ''President'' and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than the standard frigates of the period. Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the [[Quasi War]] with France and to defeat the [[Barbary pirates]] in the [[First Barbary War]].

In 1811, ''President'' was at the center of the [[Little Belt Affair]]; her crew mistakenly identified {{HMS|Little Belt|1807|6}} as {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}, which had [[impressment|impressed]] an American seaman. The ships exchanged cannon fire for several minutes. Subsequent U.S. and [[Royal Navy]] investigations placed responsibility for the attack on the other ship. The incident contributed to tensions between the U.S. and Great Britain that led to the [[War of 1812]].

During the war, ''President'' made several extended cruises patrolling as far away as the [[English Channel]] and [[Norway]], capturing the armed [[schooner]] {{HMS|Highflyer|1813|6}} and numerous [[merchant ship]]s. In January 1815, after a year [[blockade]]d in New York by the Royal Navy, ''President'' engaged the frigate {{HMS|Endymion|1797|6}} off the coast of the city. She was captured soon afterward by a British squadron and the Royal Navy placed her into their service as '''HMS ''President''''' until [[Ship breaking|broken up]] in 1818. ''President''{{'}}s design was copied and used to build the next {{HMS|President|1829|6}} in 1829.

==Design and construction==
{{main|Original six frigates of the United States Navy}}

During the 1790s American [[merchant vessel]]s began to fall prey to [[Barbary corsairs|Barbary Pirates]] in the [[Mediterranean]], most notably from [[Algiers]]. Congress's response was the [[Naval Act of 1794]].<ref name="Allen1909-4142">Allen (1909), pp. 41<U+2013>42.</ref> The Act provided funds for the construction of six frigates; however, it included a clause stating that construction of the ships would cease if the United States agreed to peace terms with Algiers.<ref name="Beach29">Beach (1986), p. 29.</ref><ref Name="NA1794">''An Act to provide a Naval Armament''. {{USStat|1|350}} (1794). [[Library of Congress]]. Retrieved 17&nbsp;February 2010.</ref>

[[Joshua Humphreys]]' design was long on [[keel]] and narrow of [[beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) for mounting very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal [[scantling]] (rib) scheme to limit [[hogging and sagging|hogging]] while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This gave the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Humphreys developed his design after realizing that the fledgling United States could not match the navy sizes of the European states. He therefore designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a [[ship of the line]].<ref name="Toll4953">Toll (2006), pp. 49<U+2013>53.</ref><ref name="Beach2930">Beach (1986), pp. 29<U+2013>30, 33.</ref><ref name="Allen1909-4245">Allen (1909), pp. 42<U+2013>45.</ref>

[[George Washington]] named ''President'', to reflect a principle of the United States Constitution.<ref name="Beach29">Beach (1986), p. 29.</ref><ref name="Toll61">Toll (2006), p. 61.</ref> In March 1796, before ''President''{{'}}s keel could be laid down, the United States signed a peace treaty with Algiers; as the Naval Act mandated, construction came to a halt.<ref name="Beach29"/><ref Name="NA1794"/> At the onset of the [[Quasi-War]] with France in 1798, funds were approved to complete her construction and her keel was laid at a shipyard in New York City. Her naval constructor was Forman Cheeseman and the superintendent Captain [[Silas Talbot]].<ref name="NHFQW">{{cite web|title=Navy History: Federal/Quasi War

Based on experience Humphreys gained during construction of ''President''{{'}}s [[sister ship]]s, {{USS|Constitution||2}} and {{USS|United States|1797|2}}, he instructed Cheeseman to make alterations to the frigate's design. These included raising the [[gun deck]] by {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}} and moving the [[main-mast|main mast]] {{convert|2|ft|cm|abbr=on}} further rearward.<ref name="Toll107"/> ''President'' was built to a length of {{convert|175|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]] and a beam of {{convert|44.4|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="DANFS">{{cite DANFS|title=President

===Armament===
{{see also|Naval artillery in the Age of Sail}}

''President''{{'}}s nominal rating was that of a 44-gun ship. However, she usually carried over 50&nbsp;guns.<ref name="Teddy5556">Roosevelt (1883), pp. 55<U+2013>56.</ref> ''President'' was originally armed with a battery of 55&nbsp;guns: thirty-two 24-pounder (10.9&nbsp;kg) cannon; twenty-two 42-pounder (19&nbsp;kg) [[carronade]]s; and one 18-pounder (8&nbsp;kg) [[long gun]].<ref name="DANFS"/>

During her Royal Navy service as HMS ''President'', she was initially rated  at 50-guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60-guns<U+2014>thirty 24-pounders (10.9&nbsp;kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19&nbsp;kg) carronades on the spar deck plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817 she was again re-rated, this time to 60-guns.<ref name="Winfield124"/><ref name="Toll445"/>

Unlike modern Navy vessels, ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns. Guns were portable and often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel's armaments to his liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel's armament would change often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.<ref name="Jennings">{{cite book|title=Tattered Ensign The Story of America's Most Famous Fighting Frigate, U.S.S Constitution|last=Jennings|first=John |publisher=Thomas Y.

==Quasi and First Barbary Wars==
{{see also|Quasi-War|First Barbary War}}

''President'' launched on 10&nbsp;April 1800<U+2014>the last of the [[Original six frigates of the United States Navy|original six frigates]] to do so. After her [[fitting out]], she departed for [[Guadeloupe]] on 5&nbsp;August with Captain [[Thomas Truxtun]] in command. She conducted routine patrols during the latter part of the Quasi-War and made several recaptures of American merchant ships. Nevertheless, her service in this period was uneventful. She returned to the United States in March, after a [[Convention of 1800|peace treaty with France]] was ratified on 3&nbsp;February 1801.<ref name="Allen1909-217221">Allen (1909), pp. 217, 221.</ref>
[[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt=A relief map of the Mediterranean Sea area depicting the countries that surround it|Mediterranean Sea area of operation]]
During the Quasi-War, the United States paid [[tribute]] to the [[Barbary Coast|Barbary States]] to ensure that they would not seize or harass American merchant ships.<ref name="MaclaySmith215216">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 215<U+2013>216.</ref> In 1801 [[Yusuf Karamanli]] of [[Tripoli]], dissatisfied with the amount of tribute in comparison to that paid to [[Algiers]], demanded an immediate payment of $250,000.<ref name="Allen058890">Allen (1905), pp. 88, 90.</ref> [[Thomas Jefferson]] responded by sending a squadron of warships to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and pursue peace with the Barbary States.<ref name="MaclaySmith228">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 228.</ref><ref name="Allen0592">Allen (1905), p. 92.</ref>

In May, Commodore [[Richard Dale]] selected ''President'' as his [[flagship]] for the assignment in the Mediterranean. Dale's orders were to present a [[show of force]] off Algiers, Tripoli and [[Tunis]] and maintain peace with promises of tribute. Dale was authorized to commence hostilities at his discretion if any Barbary State had declared war by the time of his arrival.<ref name="MaclaySmith228"/><ref name="Allen0592"/> Dale's squadron consisted of ''President'', {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|2}}, {{USS|Essex|1799|2}}, and {{USS|Enterprise|1799|2}}.<ref name="Cooper151">Cooper (1856), p. 151.</ref> The squadron arrived at [[Gibraltar]] on 1&nbsp;July; ''President'' and ''Enterprise'' quickly continued to Algiers, where their presence convinced the regent to withdraw threats he had made against American merchant ships.<ref name="Allen05-9495">Allen (1905), pp. 94<U+2013>95.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith231">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 231.</ref> ''President'' and ''Enterprise'' subsequently made appearances at [[Tunis]] and Tripoli before ''President'' arrived at [[Malta]] 16&nbsp;August to replenish drinking water.<ref name="Allen05-95">Allen (1905), p. 95.</ref>

Blockading the harbor of Tripoli on 24&nbsp;August, ''President'' captured a Greek vessel with Tripolitan soldiers aboard. Dale negotiated an exchange of prisoners that resulted in the release of several Americans held captive in Tripoli.<ref name="Cooper153">Cooper (1856), p. 153.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith232233">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 232<U+2013>233.</ref> ''President'' arrived at Gibraltar on 3&nbsp;September.<ref name="Allen05-98">Allen (1905), p. 98.</ref> Near [[Mah<U+00F3>n]] in early December, ''President'' struck a large rock while traveling at {{convert|6|kn|km/h mph|abbr=off|lk=off}}.

Although ''President'' remained in the United States, operations against the Barbary States continued. A second squadron assembled under the command of [[Richard Valentine Morris]] in {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|2}}. Morris' poor performance resulted in his recall and subsequent dismissal from the Navy in 1803.<ref name="Toll173">Toll (2006), p. 173.</ref> A third squadron assembled under the command of [[Edward Preble]] in {{USS|Constitution||2}}; by July 1804 they had fought the [[Battle of Tripoli Harbor]].<ref name="Allen05200">Allen (1905), p. 200.</ref>

===Second Barbary patrol===
In April 1804 President Jefferson decided to reinforce Preble's squadron. ''President'', ''Congress'', ''Constellation'' and ''Essex'' prepared to sail as soon as possible under the direction of Commodore [[Samuel Barron (1765-1810)|Samuel Barron]].<ref name="Allen05198199">Allen (1905), pp. 198<U+2013>199.</ref> Barron selected ''President'' as his flagship but she required repairs to her masts and rigging, and a new [[bowsprit]]. Some two months passed before the squadron was ready to sail. They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12&nbsp;August.<ref name="Allen05218">Allen (1905), p. 218.</ref><ref name="Toll224227">Toll (2006), pp. 224<U+2013>227.</ref>

''President'' left Gibraltar on 16&nbsp;August with ''Constellation''; the frigates paused at Malta, before arriving off Tripoli on 10&nbsp;September, joining ''Constitution'', {{USS|Argus|1803|2}}, and {{USS|Vixen|1803|2}}.<ref name="MaclaySmith297">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 297.</ref> Sighting three ships running the blockade of Tripoli, the squadron moved in to capture them; during the pursuit, a sudden change in wind direction caused ''President'' to collide with ''Constitution''. The collision caused serious damage to ''Constitution''{{'}}s stern, bow and [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]]. Two of the captured ships were sent to Malta with ''Constitution''; ''President'' sailed to [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], arriving on 27&nbsp;August.<ref name="Allen1905-219220">Allen (1905), pp. 219<U+2013>220.</ref><ref name="Toll250251">Toll (2006), pp. 250<U+2013>251.</ref>

When Barron arrived in the Mediterranean, his seniority of rank over Preble entitled him to assume the duties of Commodore.<ref name="Toll250">Toll (2006), p. 250.</ref> However, soon after replacing Preble, Barron went ashore at Syracuse in poor heath and became bedridden.<ref name="Allen1905-220">Allen (1905), p. 220.</ref> Under command of Captain George Cox, ''President'' began routine blockade duties of Tripoli during the winter months of 1804<U+2013>05. In late April 1805, ''Constitution'' captured three ships off Tripoli. ''President'' escorted them to port at Malta before rejoining ''Constitution''.<ref name="Allen1905-220223">Allen (1905), pp. 220<U+2013>223.</ref>

Barron's fragile health necessitated his resignation; he passed command to [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]] in late May 1805.<ref name="MaclaySmith300">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 300.</ref> Barron ordered Cox to command ''Essex'' and turned ''President'' over to his brother, [[James Barron]], on 29&nbsp;May.<ref name="Allen1905-220"/> On 3&nbsp;June, after the [[Battle of Derne]], the U.S signed a peace treaty with Tripoli.<ref name="MaclaySmith300"/><ref name="Allen1905-250">Allen (1905), p. 250.</ref> ''President'' sailed for the United States on 13&nbsp;July, carrying the ailing Barron and many sailors released from captivity in Tripoli.<ref name="Allen1905-270">Allen (1905), p. 270.</ref>

In 1807 the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] heightened tensions between the United States and Britain. In preparation for further hostilities, Congress began authorizing naval appropriations and ''President'' recommissioned in 1809 under the command of Commodore John Rodgers. She made routine and uneventful patrols, mainly along the United States' eastern seaboard, until 1&nbsp;May 1811 when the British frigate {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}} stopped the American brig ''Spitfire'' eighteen miles from New York and [[impressment|impressed]] a crewman.<ref name="Beach69">Beach (1986), p. 69.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith312">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 312.</ref><ref name="Cooper233235">Cooper (1856), pp. 233, 235.</ref>{{#tag:ref|There was a US Navy ship named {{USS|Spitfire|1803|2}} in service during this period, but sources are not clear if the ''Spitfire'' mentioned here was a US Navy ship. This ''Spitfire'' is invariably described as "a merchant brig" or "American brig". The ''DANFS'' article on the US Navy ship ''Spitfire'' makes no mention of the impressment incident, but the descriptions of both ships are very similar.<ref>{{cite DANFS|title=Spitfire

Rodgers received orders to pursue ''Guerriere'' and ''President'' sailed immediately from [[Fort Severn]] on 10&nbsp;May. On 16&nbsp;May, approximately {{convert|40|mi}} northeast of [[Cape Henry]], a lookout spotted a sail on the horizon. Closing to investigate, Rodgers determined the sail belonged to a warship, and raised [[signal flag]]s to identify his ship. The unidentified ship, later learned to be {{HMS|Little Belt|1807|6}}<U+2014>a 20-gun [[sixth rate]]<U+2014>hoisted signal flags in return, but the hoist was not understood by ''President''{{'}}s crew. ''Little Belt'' sailed southward and Rodgers, believing the ship to be ''Guerriere'', pursued.<ref name="Cooper235236">Cooper (1856), pp. 235<U+2013>236.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith313314">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 313<U+2013>314.</ref>

Darkness set in before the ships were within hailing distance and Rodgers hailed twice only to have the same question returned to him: "What ship is that?"<ref name="Beach69"/><ref name="Toll321322">Toll (2006), pp. 321<U+2013>322.</ref> According to Rodgers, immediately after the exchange of hails, ''Little Belt'' fired a shot that tore through ''President''{{'}}s rigging. Rodgers returned fire and ''Little Belt'' promptly answered with three guns, and then a whole [[broadside]]. Rodgers ordered his gun crews to fire at will; several accurate broadsides heavily damaged ''Little Belt'' in return. After five minutes of firing, ''President''{{'}}s crew realized their adversary was much smaller than a frigate and Rodgers ordered a cease fire. However, ''Little Belt'' fired again and ''President'' answered with more broadsides. After ''Little Belt'' became silent, ''President'' stood off and waited overnight. At dawn it was obvious that ''Little Belt'' was greatly damaged from the fight and Rodgers sent a boat over from ''President'' to offer assistance in repairing the damage. Her Captain, [[Arthur Bingham]], acknowledged the damage; declining any help, he sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia.<ref name="Beach70">Beach (1986), p. 70.</ref> ''President'' had one sailor slightly wounded in the exchange, while ''Little Belt'' suffered thirty-one killed or wounded.<ref name="Toll321322"/><ref name="MaclaySmith314315">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 314<U+2013>315.</ref><ref name="Cooper236237">Cooper (1856), pp. 236<U+2013>237.</ref>

Upon ''President''{{'}}s return to port the US Navy launched an investigation into the incident. Gathering testimony from ''President''{{'}}s officers and crewman they determined that ''Little Belt'' had fired the first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation Captain Bingham insisted that ''President'' had fired the first shot and continued firing for forty-five minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually insisted that the other ship had fired the first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.<ref name="MaclaySmith315">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 315<U+2013>316.</ref><ref name="Cooper237238">Cooper (1856), pp. 237<U+2013>238.</ref><ref name="Toll323">Toll (2006), p. 323.</ref>

The United States declared war against Britain on 18&nbsp;June 1812. Three days later, within an hour of receiving official word of the declaration, Commodore Rodgers sailed from New York City. The commodore sailed aboard ''President'', leading a squadron consisting of ''United States'', ''Congress'', [[USS Hornet (1805, brig)|''Hornet'']], and [[USS Argus (1803)|''Argus'']] on a seventy-day North Atlantic cruise.<ref name="Teddy73">Roosevelt (1883), p. 73.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith322">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 322.</ref> A passing American merchant ship informed Rodgers about a fleet of British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica.

The ensuing confusion allowed ''Belvidera'' to fire her stern chasers, killing six more men aboard ''President''. Rodgers kept up the pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage ''Belvidera''{{'}}s rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect.<ref name="Teddy75"/> The crew of ''Belvidera'' quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats, and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. ''Belvidera'' soon gained enough speed to distance herself from ''President'' and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. ''Belvidera'' sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia to deliver the news that war had been declared.<ref name="MaclaySmith324325">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 324<U+2013>325.</ref><ref name="Teddy76">Roosevelt (1883), p. 76.</ref>

Meanwhile, ''President'' kept after ''Galatea'' and drew very close, but lost sight of her in the night.<ref name="Teddy107"/> ''Congress'' and ''President'' remained together but during November did not find any ships to capture. Returning to the United States, they passed north of Bermuda and proceeded toward the [[Virginia Capes|Virginia capes]]; they arrived in Boston on 31&nbsp;December, having taken nine prizes.<ref name="Teddy107"/> ''President'' and ''Congress'' found themselves [[blockade]]d there by the Royal Navy until April 1813.<ref name="MaclaySmith426427">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 426<U+2013>427.</ref>

On 30&nbsp;April ''President'' and ''Congress'' sailed through the blockade on their third cruise of the war. on 2&nbsp;May they pursued {{HMS|Curlew|1812|6}}, but she outran them and escaped.<ref name="Teddy174">Roosevelt (1883), p. 174.</ref> ''President'' parted company with ''Congress'' on 8&nbsp;May and Rodgers set a course along the [[Gulf Stream]] to search for merchant ships to capture.<ref name="Teddy174"/> By June, not having come across a single ship, ''President'' turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway on 27&nbsp;June to replenish her drinking water.<ref name="MaclaySmith521522">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 521<U+2013>522.</ref> Sailing soon after, ''President'' captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores.<ref name="Teddy175">Roosevelt (1883), p. 175.</ref> Around the same time, two Royal Navy ships came into view. ''President'' set all sails to escape in a chase lasting eighty hours before outrunning them.<ref name="Teddy175"/> Rodgers reported that his decision to flee the ships was based on identifying them as a [[ship of the line]] and a frigate. Royal Navy records later revealed that the vessels were actually the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Alexandria|1806|6}} and the 16-gun fireship {{HMS|Spitfire|1782|2}}.<ref name="Teddy175176">Roosevelt (1883), p. 175<U+2013>176.</ref>

Spending a few days near the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|Irish Channel]], ''President'' captured several more merchant ships. She then set a course for the United States. In late September she encountered [[HMS Highflyer (1813)|HMS ''Highflyer'']] along the east coast of the United States. Rodgers used his signal flags to trick ''Highflyer'' into believing that ''President'' was [[HMS Tenedos (1812)|HMS ''Tenedos'']].<ref name="hepper">{{cite book|isbn=0-948864-30-3|oclc=36739466|title=British Warship Losses in the Age of Sail, 1650<U+2013>1859|authorlink=|last=Hepper|first=David J.|publisher=J.

On 4&nbsp;December ''President'' sailed from Providence, Rhode Island. On the 25th she encountered two frigates in the dark, one of which fired at her. Rodgers believed the ships to be British, but they were two French frigates, [[French frigate M<U+00E9>duse (1810)|''Meduse'']] and [[French frigate Nymphe (1811)|''Nymphe'']].<ref name="Teddy217">Roosevelt (1883), p. 217.</ref> Afterward, Rodgers headed toward Barbados for an eight week cruise in the [[West Indies]], reportedly making three small captures. Returning to New York City on 18&nbsp;February 1814, ''President'' encountered [[French frigate Loire (1797)|HMS ''Loire'']], which turned to escape once the latter's crew realized ''President'' was a 44-gun frigate.<ref name="Teddy286">Roosevelt (1883), p. 286.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith541">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 541.</ref> ''President'' remained in New York for the duration of 1814 due to the harbor's blockade by a British squadron consisting of [[HMS Endymion (1797)|HMS ''Endymion'']], [[HMS Majestic (1785)|''Majestic'']], [[HMS Pomone (1811)|''Pomone'']] and ''Tenedos''.<ref name="Teddy401">Roosevelt (1883), p. 401.</ref><ref name="MaclaySmith640">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 640.</ref>

The [[Treaty of Ghent]], ending hostilities between the United States and Britain, was signed on 24&nbsp;December 1814. However, the United States did not ratify the treaty until 18&nbsp;February 1815. In the interim, the war carried on as usual.<ref name="Teddy400">Roosevelt (1883), p. 400.</ref><ref name="Toll442">Toll (2006), p. 442.</ref>

[[Stephen Decatur]] assumed command of ''President'' in December 1814, planning a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid January 1815 a snowy [[gale]] with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from New York Harbor, giving Decatur the opportunity to put to sea. On the evening of 14&nbsp;January, ''President'' headed out of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the bar, ''President'' lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers twisted and masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to [[hogging and sagging|hog and sag]]. Finally floating ''President'' off the bar and assessing the damage, Decatur decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and ''President'' was forced to head out to sea.<ref name="Teddy401402">Roosevelt (1883), pp. 401<U+2013>402.</ref><ref name="MacSmith641">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 641.</ref><ref name="Cooper429">Cooper (1856), p. 429.</ref>

Unaware of the exact location of the blockading squadron, Decatur set a course to avoid them and seek a safe port, but approximately two hours later the squadron's sails were spotted on the horizon. ''President'' changed course to outrun them but the damage she suffered the night before had significantly reduced her speed.<ref name="Cooper430">Cooper (1856), p. 430.</ref> Attempting to gain speed, Decatur ordered expendable cargo thrown overboard, yet by late afternoon of 15&nbsp;January, HMS ''Endymion'' came alongside and proceeded to fire broadsides.<ref name="MacSmith641642">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 641<U+2013>642.</ref><ref name="Teddy402">Roosevelt (1883), p. 402.</ref> Decatur planned to bring ''President'' in close to ''Endymion'', whereby ''President''{{'}}s crew could board and capture the opposing ship and sail her to New York. ''President'' in turn would be [[Scuttling|scuttled]] to prevent her capture.<ref name="Cooper431">Cooper (1856), p. 431.</ref><ref name="Toll443">Toll (2006), p. 443.</ref>

Making several attempts to close on ''Endymion'', Decatur discovered that ''President''{{'}}s damage limited her maneuverability, allowing ''Endymion'' to anticipate and draw away from positions favorable for boarding. Faced with this new dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable ''Endymion''{{'}}s sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow ''President'' to proceed to a safe port without being followed. After a two hour engagement ''Endymion'' was disabled as planned.<ref name="Cooper431"/><ref name="MacSmith645">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 645.</ref><ref name="Teddy403">Roosevelt (1883), p. 403.</ref>

''President'' drew away while her crew made hurried repairs. Within two hours one of her lookouts spotted the remainder of the enemy squadron drawing near. ''President'' continued her escape attempt, but by nightfall HMS ''Pomone'' and ''Tenedos'' had caught up and began firing broadsides. Realizing his situation, Decatur surrendered ''President'' just before midnight.<ref name="MacSmith646">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, p. 646.</ref><ref name="Cooper432">Cooper (1856), p. 432.</ref><ref name="Teddy404">Roosevelt (1883), p. 404.</ref>

==As HMS ''President''==
Now in possession of the Royal Navy, ''President'' and her crew were ordered to proceed to [[Bermuda]] with ''Endymion''. During the journey, they encountered a dangerous gale. The storm destroyed ''President''{{'}}s masts and strained ''Endymion''{{'}}s timbers so badly that all the upper-deck guns were thrown overboard to prevent her from sinking.<ref name="MacSmith648649">Maclay and Smith (1898), Volume 1, pp. 648<U+2013>649.</ref><ref name="Teddy405">Roosevelt (1883), p. 405.</ref> Decatur and his crew were briefly held prisoner in Bermuda. Upon the prisoners' return to the United States a US Navy court martial board acquitted Decatur, his officers and his men of any wrongdoing in the surrender of ''President''.<ref name="Toll445">Toll (2006), p. 445.</ref><ref name="Cooper433">Cooper (1856), p. 433.</ref>

''President'' and ''Endymion'' continued to England, arriving at [[Spithead]] on 28&nbsp;March. ''President'' was commissioned into the Royal Navy under the name HMS ''President''. Her initial rating was set at 50-guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60-guns<U+2014>thirty 24-pounders (10.9&nbsp;kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19&nbsp;kg) carronades on the spar deck plus two more 24-pounder guns on the forecastle. In February 1817 she was again re-rated, this time to 60-guns.<ref name="Winfield124"/><ref name="Toll445"/>

In March 1818 she was considered for refitting. A [[drydock]] inspection revealed that the majority of her timber was defective or rotten and she was broken up at Portsmouth in June.<ref name="Winfield124"/> ''President''{{'}}s design was copied and used to build {{HMS|President|1829|6}} in 1829, although this was reportedly more of a political maneuver than a testament to the design. The Royal Navy wished to retain the name and likeness of the American ship on their register as a reminder to the United States and other nations of the capture.<ref name="Gardiner97140141">Gardiner (2000), pp. 97, 140<U+2013>141.</ref><ref name="Beach135">Beach (1986), p. 135.</ref>
