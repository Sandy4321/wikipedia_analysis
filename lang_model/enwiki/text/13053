==Background==

The election was held following the early dissolution of the House of Representatives.  The [[Prime Minister of Australia]], [[Robert Menzies]], gave as his reason for calling an election within two years that there was an insufficient working majority in the House.<ref>{{Cite web

 }}</ref>  The [[Australian federal election, 1961|1961 election]] had been won with a substantially reduced majority of only two seats.  One of the consequences of an early House election was that there were separate Senate and House elections until [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974]].

The Coalition government of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] led by Robert Menzies and the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] led by [[John McEwen]]  was returned with a substantially increased majority over the [[Australian Labor Party]] led by [[Arthur Calwell]].

[[Indigenous Australians]] could vote in federal elections on the same basis as other electors for the first time in this election following an amendment to the [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918|Commonwealth Electoral Act]] becoming law on 1 November. The amendment enfranchised Indigenous people in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. Indigenous voting rights in other states had been in place since 1949.

== Issues ==
=== State aid for non-government schools ===
[[Image:GoulburnStBrigid'sToilets.jpg|left|thumb|The toilets of St Brigid's; the reason for the 1962 school strike and the beginning of state aid to non-government schools.]]
The election was notable for the issue of state aid to non-government schools being finally resolved.  There was a school strike in [[Goulburn, New South Wales]] in 1962. Health officials had requested the installation of three extra toilets at a [[Roman Catholicism in Australia|Catholic]] primary school. The Catholic Church declared it had no money to install the extra toilets. The [[archdiocese]] closed down its schools and sent the children to government schools.  Nearly 1,000 children turned up to be enrolled locally and the state schools were unable to accommodate them. The strike received national attention.  The Labor [[Premiers of New South Wales|premier of New South Wales]], [[Robert Heffron]], had promised money for science labs at non-government schools.  This policy was overturned by a meeting of the Labor Party's federal executive.  Under ALP rules the federal executive had responsibility for party policy when the party's national conference was out of session.  Menzies called a snap election with state aid for science blocks and Commonwealth scholarships for students at both government and non-government schools as part of his party's platform.  This tended to woo Catholic voters away from the Labor Party which they traditionally supported; the wedge driven between the ALP and its Catholic constituency took nearly a decade to overcome.  Most non-government schools were Catholic.  The Labor Party suffered a first-preference swing of &minus;.43% and the loss of ten seats.  The Country Party vote was higher than the [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]] (DLP) vote for the first time since [[Australian federal election, 1955|1955]]; the DLP had evolved from the Catholic wing of the ALP. The Liberal Party was, however, not dependent on the state-aid issue to win the election;<ref>{{Cite web

 }}</ref> other issues, such as the "36 faceless men" gibe, also did damage to the ALP.

=== North-west Cape communications facility ===
Other key issues in the election included the building of the [[Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt|North-west Cape communications facility]] which would support the [[Submarines in the United States Navy|US nuclear submarine capability]].  A special federal conference of the ALP was called in March 1963. Labor voted  by a narrow margin to support the base.  The [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Left faction]] was opposed to a foreign base on Australian soil and which supported America's nuclear program.<ref name="Crikey">{{Cite web

=== "36 faceless men" ===
[[Image:Harold E Holt Naval Base.jpg|thumb|left|Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt, the North-west Cape communications facility which was built in the 1960s]]
At the March ALP conference, journalist [[Alan Reid (journalist)|Alan Reid]] commissioned a photograph of Arthur Calwell and [[Gough Whitlam]] standing outside the venue at [[Kingston, Australian Capital Territory|Kingston in Canberra]].  Although Calwell was the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives and Whitlam was on the opposition front bench, neither man was a member of the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|Party's federal executive]].  Reid jibed that the ALP was ruled by "36 [[faceless men]]" <U+2013> a jibe that was effectively used by Menzies and is still remembered more than 40 years later.<ref name="Crikey"/><ref name="nla">{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/2006/jul06/story-3.pdf|title=The Ultimate Insider|first=Stephen|last=Holt|publisher=National Library Australia News|date=July 2006|volume=16|issue=10|accessdate=3 November 2010|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="mediareport">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/mediareport/stories/2008/2447684.htm|title=Tracking the Red Fox|work=Media Report|publisher=[[Radio National|ABC Radio National]]|date=18 December 2008|accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref>

=== Assassination of US President Kennedy ===
The week before the election, on 22 November 1963,  [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy, the President of the United States, was assassinated]].  It has been suggested that this tragedy helped to consolidate Menzies' position.<ref>{{Cite web

The stored ballot papers for the 1983 election were put through this process prior to their destruction.
