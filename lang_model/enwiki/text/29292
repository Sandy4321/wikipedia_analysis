The '''Yokosuka E1Y''' was a [[Japan]]ese [[floatplane]] of the 1920s.  A single-engined [[biplane]] that was designed and developed by the [[Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal]] as a reconnaissance aircraft for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], 320 were built as the '''Type 14 Reconnaissance Seaplane''', entering service in 1925 and remained in operational service until 1932.

==Development and design==
In 1921, the Japanese Naval Arsenal at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]] started design of a single-engined reconnaissance [[floatplane]] to replace the Navy's [[Yokosuka Ro-go Ko-gata]] floatplanes. The resulting aircraft, the '''Type 10 Reconnaissance Seaplane'''{{ref label|Note1|a|a}} was designed by a team led by a member of a visiting delegation from [[Short Brothers]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. It was a single-engined two-bay, two-seat [[biplane]] powered by a 400&nbsp;hp (298&nbsp;kW) [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] engine. Two were completed in 1923, but showed poor performance due to being overweight. A modified aircraft, the Type 10 Model A flew in 1924, showing only slight improvement, while a further revised prototype, the Model B flew in 1925, this curing the aircraft's weight problems while demonstrating better stability and control. As a result, several pre-production Type Bs were built.<ref name="Mikesh1990p272">{{Harvnb|Mikesh and Abe|1990|p=272.}}</ref> 

Although the Type 10 was not adopted by the Japanese Navy,<ref name="Mikesh1990p272"/> it was again redesigned, reducing the wingspan from 16.16&nbsp;m (53&nbsp;ft 0<U+00BC>&nbsp;in) to 13.99&nbsp;m (45&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in) and reducing the empty weight from 1,912&nbsp;kg (4,215&nbsp;lb) to 1,660&nbsp;kg (3,659&nbsp;lb).<ref name="Mikesh1990p272,275">{{harvnb|Mikesh and Abe|1990|pp=272, 275.}}</ref> In this form, the revised design was accepted in January 1926 as the '''Type 14 Reconnaissance Seaplane''', later receiving the [[Japanese military aircraft designation systems|short designation]] E1Y.<ref name="Mikesh1990p273">{{Harvnb|Mikesh and Abe|1990|p=273.}}</ref> 

Two versions entered service in 1926, a two-seater powered by a {{convert|400|hp|abbr=on}} [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] 1 V-12 engine, the Type 14-1 or E1Y1, and a three-seater with all-metal floats and a more powerful Lorraine-Dietrich 2 [[W engine]].<ref name="Mikesh1990p274"/> In 1928, the Type 14-2 was used as the basis for the Type 90-3 Reconnaissance Seaplane, of which about 20 were built as the [[Yokosuka E5Y|Yokosuka E5Y1]] and [[Kawanishi E5K1]].<ref name="Mikesh1990pp278-279">{{Harvnb|Mikesh and Abe|1990|pp=278<U+2013>279.}}</ref>

As the Type 90-3 showed little improvement over the Type 14-2 from which it was developed, in 1931, Yokosuka developed the further refined Type 14-3 Reconnaissance aircraft, with a new tail, a geared Lorraine-Dietrich 3 engine and significantly improved performance.<ref name="Mikesh1990p274"/>

A total of 218 E1Y1 and E1Y2s were built by Yokosuka (23), [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]] (47) and [[Aichi Kokuki|Aichi]] (148). 102 E1Y3s were built by Aichi.<ref name="Mikesh1990p275"/>

==Operational history==
The E1Y1 and E1Y2 entered service in 1926, replacing Yokosuka Ro-Go Ko-Gata and [[Hansa-Brandenburg W.33]] seaplanes, with the E1Y3 following them into service from 1931. The E1Ys formed the main reconnaissance seaplane equipment of the fleet, operating from [[battleship]]s and [[seaplane tender]]s. E1Ys were operated from the seaplane tender [[Japanese seaplane carrier Notoro|''Notoro'']] during the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident]] of early 1932. The E1Y remained in use until the early part of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].<ref name="Mikesh1990p274"/>

Many E1Ys were sold as civil aircraft from 1932, usually converted with a cabin for three or four passengers. Some were fitted with [[Napier Lion]] engines.<ref name="Mikesh1990pp274-275"/>
