'''Supernatural fiction''' (properly, "supernaturalist fiction") is a [[literary genre]] exploiting or requiring as plot devices or themes some contradictions of the commonplace [[natural world]] and [[materialist]] assumptions about it. 

In its broadest definition, supernatural fiction includes examples of [[horror fiction]], [[fantasy fiction]], and such sub-genres as [[vampire literature]]. Elements of supernatural fiction can be found in writing from genres such as [[science fiction]]. Amongst academics, readers and collectors, however, supernatural fiction is often classed as a discreet genre defined by the elimination of "horror", "fantasy" and elements important to other genres.<ref>Glen Cavaliero, ''The Supernatural and English Fiction'', Oxford, 1995</ref> The one genre supernatural fiction appears happy to embrace in its entirety is the traditional [[ghost story]].<ref>Neil Wilson, ''Shadows in the Attic: A Guide to British Supernatural Fiction 1820-1950'', The British Library, 2000</ref>

In the twentieth century supernatural fiction has become associated with [[psychological fiction]]. The result is that the supernatural is only one explanation for what has been described. A classic example of this would be ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' by [[Henry James]], which offers both a supernatural and a pyschological interpretation of the events described. The ambiguity is considered to add to the effect.<ref>Everett F. Bleiler, ''The Guide to Supernatural Fiction'', Kent State University Press, 1983, pps.277-278</ref>

Supernatural fiction continues to be popular, but because it is not simple to define and is not popularly understood, it is not used by publishers, booksellers, libraries etc. When marketed, supernatural fiction is often classed as mainstream fiction, or is assumed by other subgenres.
