'''Michael Arthur Newdow''' (born June 24, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] attorney and [[emergency medicine]] [[physician]]. He is best known for his efforts to have recitations of the current version of the [[Pledge of Allegiance]] in [[Public school (government funded)#United States|public schools]] in the United States declared [[United States Constitution|unconstitutional]] because of its inclusion of the phrase "under God". He also filed and lost a lawsuit to stop the invocation prayer at President Bush's second inauguration<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,144355,00.html Fox News: Court Rejects Challenge to Inaugural Prayer]</ref><ref>[http://www.christiantoday.com/article/michael.newdow.versus.president.bush/1935.htm Christian Today: Michael Newdow Versus President Bush]</ref><ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E6DD1538F936A25752C0A9639C8B63 The New York Times: Judge Declines To Block Inauguration Prayer]</ref> and, most recently, he filed a lawsuit to prevent references to God and religion from being part of President Obama's inauguration. 

Newdow is an [[atheism|atheist]] and an ordained minister of the [[Universal Life Church]].<ref>Lucas, Greg.  [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/03/22/MNG7E5P3GG1.DTL "Atheist dad ready for date at top court."]  ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 2004-03-22</ref> In 1997, he started an organization called FACTS (First Atheist Church of True Science), which advocates strong [[separation of church and state]] in public institutions.<ref name="bio">[http://www.evolvefish.com/newdow_bio.htm Biography of Michael Newdow], evolvefish.com</ref> He also serves on the Advisory Board of [[Secular Coalition for America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secular.org/bios/Michael_Newdow.html |title=Secular Coalition for America Advisory Board Biography |publisher=Secular.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Newdow grew up in the [[Bronx]] and [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], from where his nominally [[Jew]]ish family moved in 1960. He graduated from [[Teaneck High School]].<ref>[[Mike Kelly (journalist)|Kelly, Mike.]]  , ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]'', June 30, 2002. Accessed May 5, 2007. "But Newdow, who reportedly was nicknamed ''Noodle'' at Teaneck High School, has forced us to take a hard look at the 31-word Pledge of Allegiance that far too many of us recite by rote and without questioning what it says."</ref> 

After graduating from high school, Newdow attended [[Brown University]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[biology]] in 1974. He told ''Brown Alumni Magazine'' that he can<U+2019>t remember ever believing in God, saying, "I was born an [[atheist]]."<ref name="Brown">[http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/may/june-2004/mr.-newdow-goes-to-washington.html "Mr. Newdow Goes to Washington",]{{Dead link|date=August 2009}} By Zachary Block, ''Brown Alumni Magazine,'' May<U+2013>June 2004. Retrieved on August 26, 2007</ref> 

He then attended the [[David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|UCLA School of Medicine]], earning his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1978. He has worked as an [[emergency room]] physician at numerous [[hospital]]s, and holds medical licenses in [[California]] and five other states.<ref name="Brown"/>

Newdow later attended the [[University of Michigan Law School]], graduating with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1988. He took and passed the [[bar examination|bar exam]]{{which|date=August 2013}}<!-- which state bar exam?--> in 2002.

==Litigation==

===Pledge of Allegiance===
{{Main|Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow}}
Newdow is best known for [[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow|the lawsuit]] which he states was filed on behalf of his daughter against inclusion of the words "under God" in public schools' recitals of the [[United States]]' [[Pledge of Allegiance]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] found that the phrase constitutes an endorsement of [[religion]], and therefore violates the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. However, the decision was later overruled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on procedural grounds, citing that Newdow did not have [[Child custody|custody]] of his daughter and therefore did not have the [[Standing (law)|right]] to bring suit on her behalf, nor did he meet the Court's [[Standing (law)|prudential standing]] requirements to bring the suit on behalf of himself. 

Newdow filed suit again in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of California]] regarding the same issue, but this time on behalf of three unnamed parents and their children. Citing the [[precedent]] set by the Supreme Court in the course of Newdow's previous suit, Judge [[Lawrence K. Karlton]] ruled that Newdow did not have standing to bring his lawsuit,<ref>Newdow v. Congress of United States, 383 F. Supp. 2d 1229, 1239 (E.D. Cal. 2005)</ref> but the other plaintiffs did have standing. Based on the previous ruling by the Ninth Circuit, the judge ruled that the pledge is [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] when recited in public schools.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2005/09/16/2003271888 | title=US judge rules pledge unconstitutional | publisher=[[Taipei Times]] | date=2005-09-16 | accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/religion.cfm?ArticleID=2273 | title=Federal judge rules Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional | publisher=[[Chicago Defender]] | date=2005-09-16 | accessdate=2007-03-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060111132924/http://www.chicagodefender.com/page/religion.cfm?ArticleID=2273 |archivedate = January 11, 2006}}</ref>

On March 11, 2010, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] upheld the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of ''Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/11/05-17257.pdf|title=Newdow v. Rio Linda Union Sch. Dist.|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=''United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit''|accessdate=March 12, 2010}}</ref> On page 60 of the ruling the court writes: "We hold that the California Education Code - 52720 and the School District's policy having teachers lead students in the recitation of the Pledge, and having those who do not wish to participate do so with impunity, do not violate the Establishment Clause. Therefore we reverse the decision of the district court holding that the School District's policy is unconstitutional and vacate the permanent injunction prohibiting the recitation of the Pledge by willing students."  The court also ruled against Newdow in that he had no prudential standing to file a complaint in the first place.  Senior Circuit Judge Dorothy W. Nelson joined Judge Carlos T. Bea in the ruling, but Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented.

===In God We Trust===
In November 2005, Newdow announced he wants to have "[[In God We Trust]]" removed from [[Coins of the United States dollar|U.S. coins]] and [[Federal Reserve Note|banknotes]]. In a November 14, 2005 interview with [[Fox News]]'s [[Neil Cavuto]], Newdow compared "In God We Trust" appearing on United States currency with [[racial segregation]] (specifically separate drinking fountains), saying, "How can you not compare those? What is the difference there? Both of them [whites and blacks] got equal water. They both had access. It was government saying that it's okay to separate out these two people on the basis of race. Here we're saying it's okay to separate two people on the basis of their religious beliefs."

In a 2006 interview on the day that the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the [[Pledge Protection Act]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:h2389: | title=Pledge Protection Act of 2005 | publisher=U.S. House of Representatives | accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref> Newdow told [[WERS|WERS-FM's]] David Goodman, "A few hours ago, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] of the Congress of the United States of America voted 260 to 167 to completely gut the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] of its [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] and violate numerous other clauses because they thought it was important enough to keep 'under God' in the [[Pledge of Allegiance]]. I don't think people would've done that for our political heritage or anything else. They did it because they want God in their government because it stands for a religious view that they adhere to, and they want to see that religious view espoused by government, which is exactly what the [[Establishment Clause]] forbids."{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In June 2006, a federal judge rejected Newdow's Establishment Clause lawsuit on the grounds that the minted words amount to a secular national slogan, and do not dictate anyone's beliefs. Newdow stated that he would appeal the ruling,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199211,00.html | title=Federal Judge Nixes 'In God We Trust' Lawsuit | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=2006-06-12}}</ref> although it should be noted that ''[[Aronow v. United States]]'' was decided on the same grounds in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] and the lower court was required to return the same ruling, likewise the Ninth Circuit does not traditionally overrule previous Ninth Circuit rulings.

On December 4, 2007, Newdow argued before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit to remove both "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance (Roe v. Rio Linda Union School District),{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and "In God We Trust" from United States currency.<ref>[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/religion/newdowus91405opn.pdf Newdow v. Congress of the United States], [[Findlaw.com]]</ref> The Ninth Circuit rejected Newdow's challenge. In a decision published March 11, 2010, the court held that its earlier decision in ''Aronow'', which "held the national motto is of a <U+201C>patriotic or ceremonial character,<U+201D> has no <U+201C>theological or ritualistic impact,<U+201D> and does not constitute <U+201C>governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise," foreclosed Newdow's argument.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/11/06-16344.pdf | title=Newdow v. Lefevre, No. 06-16344, at 4210 (9th Cir. Mar. 11, 2010) (citing ''Aronow'', 432 F.2d at 243-44).}}</ref> In an opinion concurring only in the judgment, even the extremely liberal Judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theweeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/001/414ilyss.asp | title=Matt Rees, ''The Judge the Supreme Court Loves to Overturn'', '''The Weekly Standard''', May 5, 1997;}} compare {{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-03/news/mn-42564_1_supreme-court | title=David G. Savage, ''Crusading Liberal Judge Keeps High Court Busy'', '''L.A. Times''', Mar. 3, 1996. | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=1996-03-03}}</ref> agreed that ''Aronow'' was controlling precedent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/03/11/06-16344.pdf | title=''Newdow'', at 4210-11 (Reinhardt, J., concurring).}}</ref>

Newdow also filed a lawsuit in [[United States federal courts|federal court]] after [[Franklin Graham]] gave the invocation at [[George W. Bush]]'s 2001 inauguration.  The lawsuit claimed that inaugural prayer was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.  It also was unsuccessful.

===California textbook case===
Newdow also represents California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials (CAPEEM), a group that has filed a lawsuit against the officials of California Department of Education and the [[California State Board of Education]].<ref>[http://www.capeem.org/pressroom.php?item1=1 CAPEEM Press Room<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The lawsuit challenges the teaching of [[Bible|biblical]] events as historical facts and was brought by CAPEEM, which was formed by [[Hindu]] parents in California.

===Obama inauguration===
On December 31, 2008, Newdow and 17 other people, plus 10 groups representing atheists, sued [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John G. Roberts]] and others involved in the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inauguration of Barack Obama]] in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], seeking to prevent the Chief Justice from saying "so help me God." The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] specifically defines only this single oath of office of 35 words and does not include these four words. 

[[The Associated Press]] ran several reports including one picked up by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and many other affiliates that inaccurately stated that the suit was an attempt by atheists to prevent the President from saying "so help me God." The suits specifically states that an injunction is not sought against the president, but rather only against the Chief Justice.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.restorethepledge.com/live/litigation/inaugural/docs/2008-12-30%20Original%20Complaint.pdf  |title=Case 1:08-cv-02248-RBW Document 1 |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2009-02-04 |format=PDF |pages=25 | publisher=www.restorethepledge.com |quote=If President-elect Obama (as a black man fully aware of the vile effects that stem from a majority's disregard of a minority's rights, and as a Democrat fully aware of the efficacy his Republican predecessor's "so help me God" oath additions) feels that the verbiage formulated by the Founders is so inadequate that he needs to interlard his oath with a purely religious phrase deemed unnecessary by the first twenty presidents, Plaintiffs have no objection at this time. The President, like all other individuals, has Free Exercise rights, which might permit such an alteration.}}</ref>

In addition, in other counts was the demand to end all religious prayer at the inauguration based on the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which he had sued to prevent in the two previous inaugurations unsuccessfully.

Judge [[Reggie Walton]] refused to grant Newdow's motion for a preliminary injunction, reasoning that as a [[United States district court|district court]] judge he did not feel he had the authority to issue such an order against the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/15/AR2009011502783.html?nav=rss_nation/special|title=Judge won't order Obama not to use 'God' in oath|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-01-20|author=Holland, Jesse J.|publisher=Associated Press}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}</ref>  and that the inclusion of such words is an exercise of the incoming President's right of free speech, although the president's right to express his private prayer in words of his choosing was specifically not challenged in the lawsuit. 

Newdow later reported that he would not challenge the denial of his preliminary injunction motion,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2009/01/newdow-wont-challenge-denial-of-injunction-on-inaugural-oath.html|title=Newdow Won't Challenge Denial of Injunction on Inaugural Oath|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-01-20|author=Mauro, Tony|publisher=[http://legaltimes.typepad.com/ The Blog of the LegalTimes]}}</ref> but would appeal the case through the appellate court.  In ''Newdow v. Roberts'', the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case, holding that Newdow's claims with respect to the 2009 inauguration were moot, and that he lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]] to challenge the 2013 and 2017 inaugurations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13559298291193146253 |title=Newdow v.

==Awards==
In November 2002, Newdow was given the Freethinker of the Year award by the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] following the Pledge case.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20041204160058/http://ffrf.org/timely/newdowpledge.php Pledging Allegiance to Constitution], excerpt of acceptance speech for "Freethinker of the Year",  [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]]  2002-11-22</ref>  In 2004, he received the special Recognition Freethought Hero Award for his case to remove "In God We Trust"  from currency.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070729192510/http://ffrf.org/awards/special/2004_newdow.php Freethought Hero Award 2004 - Mike Newdow],  [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]]  2004-10-30</ref>
