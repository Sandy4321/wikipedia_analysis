'''''Plan B''''' is a 2009 [[Spanish language]] film by [[Argentina|Argentinean]] director [[Marco Berger]].

==Plot==
The film asks questions about attraction between males and whether such "[[homosexuality|gay]]" behavior is built-in or can two presumably [[heterosexuality|straight]] guys fall in love over the long haul by spending time together and growing attached?

Bruno (Manuel Vignau) is dumped by his girlfriend Laura (Mercedes Quinteros); so Bruno's mind plans a cold, sweet vengeance on Laura's new boyfriend Pablo. Bruno wants to portray to Laura that her new boyfriend is gay. He talks aloud his plans and its progress every step of the way to his friend Victor (Dami<U+00E1>n Canduci), a sort of partner in crime and a confession wall for Bruno. And according to his plan, Bruno opens a clandestine "relationship" with Pablo in order to try to prove his point to Laura. But, along the way, there is an increasing affinity between Bruno and Pablo. The two men bond easily and quickly around a few common interests and memories from their younger days. Using alcohol and light drugs also helps them to get close, making them reconsider their own [[sexuality|sexualities]] in a new light. By the end of the film, they venture to fall into each other.
