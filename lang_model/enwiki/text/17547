One of the most damaging events in Iran was the [[2003 Bam earthquake]] in the southern portion of the country, which left more than 30,000 dead.

== Damage and casualties ==
Iran's state television said the quake hit near the towns of [[Ahar]], [[Heris]] and [[Varzaqan]] in [[East Azerbaijan Province]] at 4:53 p.m. local time (12:23 GMT). At least 153 people were confirmed killed, with more than 600 others injured. According to the head of Iran's Rescue and Relief Organisation, access to villages was cut and the only communication was via radio. Helicopters and rescue teams were immediately dispatched to try and reach remote villages. [[Press TV]] reported at least 60 villages sustained damage ranging between 50 and 80 percent, while six others were completely leveled. <ref name=RT>{{cite web|url=http://www.rt.com/news/quake-iran-killed-ahar-441/|title=153 dead and 600 injured after two quakes strike Iran - State news agency|publisher=Russia Today|date=August 11, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>

Most parts of [[Tabriz]] were without electricity, and the city was reportedly paralyzed by a large traffic jam, although no casualties were reported from the area in the first hours after the quakes struck. <ref name=CNN>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/11/world/meast/iran-earthquake/index.html|title=Death toll rises in Iran earthquakes|author=Shirzad Bozorgmehr|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=August 11, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref> At least 210 people in Varzaqan and Ahar were rescued from under the rubble of collapsed buildings, while local provincial officials urged people in the region to stay outdoors during the night for fear of aftershocks.
