According to tradition, the surname originated from a noble family of the ancient state of [[Chen (state)|Chen]], in what is now eastern [[Henan]] [[province of China|province]]. The written form of the [[Chinese character|character]] took its current standardised form around the 1st century. During the [[Han Dynasty]], it was associated with the powerful Yuan [[Chinese clan|clan]] of [[Ru'nan]] and later during [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] and [[Southern Dynasties]], with the Yuan clan of Chen.

Historically, the name has been fast growing amongst [[Han Chinese]], and has also been taken up by various non-Chinese ethnic groups. The surname is now held by more than 6.5 million people worldwide, and makes up 0.54% of the population of [[mainland China]]. Although growth has tapered off in the past six centuries, the Yuan name is still relatively widespread throughout China, as well as among [[overseas Chinese]], with heaviest per capita concentrations in the [[Yangtze Delta]] region of central coastal China.

Because the Yangtze Delta region has historically exhibited high clan consciousness, there exist a large number of Yuan [[genealogy|genealogies]], most of which are now held in public institutions. Renewed interest in ancestry outside mainland China has been encouraged by the [[Politics of the People's Republic of China|PRC government]].

== Origin of the surname ==
Traditional sources trace the surname to [[Yuan Taotu]], a 7th century BC [[Chen (state)|Chen]] nobleman, who was part of a collateral branch of the family of the [[marquis]] ruling that state.<ref>See Ouyang Xiu, ''Xin Tang shu'' (<U+65B0><U+5510><U+66F8>: "New Book of Tang") (Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1975) at 3164. According to the genealogy in ''Xin Tang shu'', Yuan Taotu was a descendant of Duke Hu, the founder of the state of Chen.</ref> He selected the second character in his grandfather's [[style name]], Boyuan (<U+4F2F><U+7230>), to be his own family name.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Yuan Taotu was granted a [[feudalism|feoff]] in Yangxia (<U+967D><U+590F>), in what is now [[Taikang]] county, [[Henan]].<ref>Ibid, at 3164.</ref> This estate is regarded as the [[ancestral home]] of the earliest Yuan [[Chinese clan|clan]]. Through its connection with the ruling family of Chen, the Yuan house could also claim ancestry from the semi-legendary [[Emperor Shun]].<ref>See Fan Ye, ''Hou Han shu''  (<U+5F8C><U+6F22><U+66F8>: "Book of Later Han")(Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1965) at 2391, 2439.</ref> Descendants of Yuan house are mentioned by name in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' as holding high office in the state of [[Chen (state)|Chen]]<ref>Zuo Qiuming (Yang Bojun ed.), ''Chun qiu [[Zuo Zhuan|Zuo zhuan]]'' (<U+6625><U+79CB><U+5DE6><U+50B3>: "Zuo's commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals") (Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1981) names Yuan Qiao (<U+8881><U+50D1>) and Yuan Po (<U+8881><U+9817>) as holding high positions in the state of Chen: <U+8944><U+516C><U+4E09><U+5E74>: <U+9673><U+516C><U+4F7F><U+8881><U+50D1> (Diplomat Yuan Qiao of Chen), <U+54C0><U+516C><U+5341><U+4E00><U+5E74>: <U+8F45><U+9817><U+70BA><U+53F8><U+5F92> (Yuan Po as Situ).</ref><ref name="Tang">Tang Xueyou (1994) [http://www.tangjiacun.com/shownews.asp?id=123 <U+8881><U+59D3><U+6539><U+6C64><U+6C0F>] ("Yuans change their surname to Tang").

An alternate, much less widely accepted theory, suggests that the surname Yuan is derived from [[Xuanyuan]] (<U+8ED2><U+8F45> or <U+7384><U+8881>), the clan name of the [[Yellow Emperor]]. After his death, the Yellow Emperor's estates came to be called Yuanyi (<U+8881><U+9091>), and his descendants took their place of birth as a surname.<ref name=Tang/>  

Prior to the [[Qin Dynasty|unification of China]] in 221 BC, the surname is only known to have been present in the historical domain of Chen. Some members of the Yuan clan are known to have moved to [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]] and other neighbouring states. The process of emigration from the Yangxia heartland continued after unification. An example of this is the case of [[Yuan Ang]], a minister to [[Emperor Gao of Han]]. His family was forced by banditry to move to Anling, in the area of modern [[Xi'an]], some 500 km west of their ancestral homeland.<ref>[[Sima Qian]], ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Shi ji]]'' (<U+53F2><U+8A18>: "Historical records") (Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1959) at 2737.</ref>

The surname Yuan could be written in at least five different ways in early [[Han Dynasty|Han]] times, and they were used interchangeably in pre-Han times.<ref>Archaic renderings of the Yuan name include: <U+8F45>; <U+69AC>; <U+6E92>; <U+63F4>; <U+7230>. According to [[Ouyang Xiu]], the now standardised character for name (<U+8881>) became prevalent around the end of the [[Qin Dynasty]] ([[2nd century BC]]), by a family which had come to reside in the region around [[Luoyang]] in central-north China.</ref> By the 1st century, the name had taken a largely standardised form (<U+8881>), which remains to the present day. An early dictonary, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi|Shuowen]]'', defines this character as "a long garment", but this archaic meaning had already fallen into disuse. The Han text ''[[Qian fu lun]]'' (<U+6F5B><U+592B><U+8AD6>: "Comments of a Recluse") suggests that the character was derived from either 1) the character ''ai'' (<U+54C0>), meaning "sorrow, grief"; or 2) a combination of the characters ''gong'' (<U+516C>: "lord") and ''gu'' (<U+8C37>: "grain").<ref>Wang Fu, ''[[Qian fu lun]]'' (<U+6F5C><U+592B><U+8AD6>: "Comments of a Recluse") (Shanghai: Shanghai Guji chuban she, 1978).</ref>

== Early Yuan clans ==
Until the end of the [[Han Dynasty]], the heartland of the Yuan house was still in the area of the ancient state of Chen. Around the 1st century, three Yuan clans rose to sufficient national importance to be mentioned in the [[Twenty-Four Histories|dynastic histories]]. All were located in close proximity of each other, on the tributaries of the [[Huai River]]. One maintained its estates at Fuyue (<U+6276><U+6A02>), in Chen (<U+9673>); another was based at Ruyang (<U+6C5D><U+967D>) in Ru'nan (<U+6C5D><U+5357>); and a third of lesser importance was associated with Yingchuan (<U+6F41><U+5DDD>). All three clans produced members of a land-owning [[gentry]] which began to participate increasingly in local and national government, although only the first two are known of in any detail.

=== The Ru'nan Yuan ===
[[Image:Yuan An stele.jpg|thumb|200px|Commemorative [[stela|stele]] honouring [[Yuan An]], erected in 117.]]

The most well-known group were undoubtedly the Yuan clan of Ru'nan (now [[Shangshui]], [[Henan]]). According to local [[genealogy|genealogies]], the Ru'nan Yuan estates were in the vicinity of the modern township of Yuanlao (<U+8881><U+8001>), bordering the Fen River (<U+6C7E><U+6C34>) in the south. There are still some 20,000 Yuan in the area and around a third of the population of Yuanlao there still bears the name Yuan.<ref>Tianjialoucun Yuan shi jiapu (<U+7530><U+5BB6><U+6A13><U+6751><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+5BB6><U+8B5C>: "Genealogy of the Yuan clan of Tianjialoucun"), quoted in Shangshui xian zhi (<U+5546><U+6C34><U+7E23><U+8A8C>: "Shangshui county gazette") (Zhengzhou: He'nan Renmin chubanshe, 1990).</ref>

The Yuan clan of Ru'nan became known among the gentry for its learning in the ''[[I Ching]]'', which was passed on between generations. The scholar [[Yuan Liang]] (<U+8881><U+826F>), the earliest Ru'nan Yuan known by name, was an aide to the [[heir apparent]], the future [[Emperor Ming of Han]]. His grandson [[Yuan An]] (<U+8881><U+5B89>) made the family's fortunes, rising rapidly through the bureaucracy from 70 AD onwards, reaching the post of [[Minister over the Masses]] and playing an important role in policy decisions at the Han court until his death in 92.<ref>See Fan Ye, note 6 at 1517<U+2013>1542; and Hu Qiuyin, ''Ru'nan Yuan shi de fazhan yu Dong Han shehui zhi bianqian'' (<U+6C5D><U+5357><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+7684><U+53D1><U+5C55><U+4E0E><U+4E1C><U+6C49><U+793E><U+4F1A><U+4E4B><U+53D8><U+8FC1>: "The development of the Yuan clan of Ru'nan and changes in [[Eastern Han]] society"), (1998) 1 ''Xuchang shizhuan xuebao'' (<U+8BB8><U+660C><U+5E08><U+4E13><U+5B66><U+62A5>) 73<U+2013>76.</ref>

One of his sons took the highest military post and two of his grandsons both reached the rank of "[[Three Excellencies]]". They did not, however, play any significant role in the [[executive (government)|executive]], and usually appeared instead as power brokers during critical events, such as the [[coup d'etat]] against [[Liang Ji]] in 169. The reputation and power of the Ru'nan Yuan was maintained with a network of clients and associates, and through intermarriage with other powerful lineages. At the time of [[Emperor Ling of Han]]'s death in 189, the clan was undisputed as the most influential in the empire. Most of its leading members lived at the capital [[Luoyang]] and some of its sons, such as [[Yuan Shao]] (<U+8881><U+7D39>), were born there. 

Yuan Shao and his cousin [[Yuan Shu]] (<U+8881><U+8853>) played leading roles in the massacre of the [[eunuch]]s in September 189 and in the succeeding years both became regional warlords.<ref>See [[Chen Shou]], [[Sanguo Zhi|''Sanguo zhi'']] (<U+4E09><U+570B><U+5FD7>: "Records of the [[Three Kingdoms]]") (Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1959) at 188<U+2013>210.</ref> Yuan Shu declared himself [[emperor of China|emperor]] in 197, basing his claim to the throne on descent from [[Emperor Shun]], and died shortly afterwards. Yuan Shao dominated much of north China until he was decisively defeated by [[Cao Cao]] at the [[Battle of Guandu]] in 200. Following his death in 202, the cohesion of Ru'nan Yuan and its followers as a national power collapsed.

=== The Yuan of Chen ===
The other Yuan clan of importance were based in the county of Fuyue, Chen [[commandery]] (part of what is now [[Taikang]] county). Like the Ru'nan Yuan, they produced generations of high officials. One of the first whose background can be verified is [[Yuan Huan]] (<U+8881><U+6E19>), who served [[Cao Cao]] and later his son [[Cao Pi]] in the civil bureaucracy.<ref>Ibid, at 333<U+2013>336.</ref> Yuan Huan doesn't seem to have been connected to the Ru'nan Yuan and his career was not affected by their downfall. Of his three sons who lived to adulthood, all were granted official positions under the [[Nine-rank system]].  

The Chen Yuan were among the northern aristocratic clans that retreated south as north China was overrun by the [[Xiongnu]]. According to the great 10th century [[genealogist]] Liu Fang: "Across the Yangzi River, the elite clans were known as 'emigre clans'; the [[Wang (surname)|Wang]] (<U+738B>), [[Tse (surname)|Xie]] (<U+8B1D>), Yuan, and [[Xiao (surname)|Xiao]] (<U+8427>)  were the greatest among them."<ref>Ouyang Xiu, note 4 at 5677<U+2013>5678.</ref> When [[Sima Rui]] established an [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Eastern Jin]] regime at [[Jiankang]] in 317, he did so with the support of powerful members of these great families. The Chen Yuan brought with them dependants and armed retainers, and they were eventually able to carve out large estates for themselves in the peripheral frontier districts. One branch of the clan settled in [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichun]], in east-central China. Eventually it grew to such size that the prefecture was renamed Yuanzhou (<U+8881><U+5DDE>) in the early 7th century.

During the Eastern Jin and the [[Southern Dynasties]] period, the Chen Yuan established extensive marriage alliances with the other major clans, especially the Xie, whose ancestral lands were in the same county. The clan also provided [[Queen consort|consort]]s for the imperial family, including the empresses of [[Emperor Wen of Southern Song]] and [[Emperor Wu of Qi China|Emperor Wu of Qi]]. The Chen Yuan had strong traditions of scholarly accomplishment rather than military leadership. It produced a number of notable scholars such as the historian [[Yuan Hong]] (<U+8881><U+5B8F>) and the poet [[Yuan Shansong]] (<U+8881><U+5C71><U+677E>).<ref>See Fang Xuanling (et al), [[Book of Jin|''Jin shu'']] (<U+6649><U+66F8>: "Book of Jin") (Beijing: Zhonghua shu ju, 1974) at 2166<U+2013>2171.</ref> Among the four great emigre clans, the Yuan were notable for never making a bid for military power. 

A branch of the Chen Yuan moved north around 420 and settled in [[Luoyang]], later serving the [[Northern Wei]]. Upon the conquest of the [[Chen Dynasty]] by [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] in 589, members of the southern ruling elite, such as [[Yuan Xian]] (<U+8881><U+61B2>), were moved to the capital [[Chang'an]] where they continued to serve in government.<ref>Xu Yuqing (2005) [http://www.hawh.cn/Template/article/display37.jsp?mid=20050104030650 <U+9648><U+90E1><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+7684><U+5386><U+53F2><U+5730><U+4F4D><U+548C><U+4F5C><U+7528>] ("The position and historical position of the Yuan clan of Chen commandery"). Retrieved 15 November 2005.</ref> A number of [[Tang Dynasty]] noblemen trace their ancestry directly to the Chen Yuan.

== Spread of the surname ==
[[Image:Yuan_distribution.png|thumb|left|300px|Distribution of the surname in China, 2000. Present-day [[political divisions of China|administrative division boundaries]] are shown. ]] 

In general, the spread of the Yuan surname has followed the migration of [[Han Chinese]] throughout [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The general trend over the past 1500 years has been a shift from north to south and southeast. 

The main branches of the Yuan clan after the [[Han Dynasty]] were all in north China, most of them in population centres near the [[Yellow River]]. In the 3rd century members of the Chen Yuan are known to have moved as far south as the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]] delta in modern [[Vietnam]].<ref>Fan Ye, note 6 at 1141.</ref> Early migrations south established Yuan clans along the lower [[Yangtze River]], in [[Danyang]], [[Lujiang]], [[Wuxi]], [[Yangzhou]] and [[Nanjing]]. Records from the [[Tang Dynasty]] name three major Yuan clans, in [[Ru'nan]], [[Pengcheng]] and [[Yichun]].<ref>Ouyang Xiu, note 4 at 3166.</ref> 

Larger scale migrations south occurred during the middle and late [[Song Dynasty]], when north China was overrun by the [[Jurchen]]s and later the [[Mongols]]. Yuan clans appeared in what is now [[Zhejiang]] ([[Hangzhou]], [[Ningbo]], [[Fenghua]] and [[Yinxian]]), [[Jiangxi]] ([[Nanchang]]) and [[Fujian]] ([[Fu'an]]). The name was already widespread in the 12th century, being concentrated in what is now [[Sichuan]], [[Zhejiang]] and [[Shanxi]].<ref>Yuan Yida and Zhang Cheng, Zhongguo xingshi (<U+4E2D><U+56FD><U+59D3><U+6C0F>: "Chinese surnames") (Shanghai: Huadong Shifan Daxue, 2002) at 195.</ref> 

Around the beginning of the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the late 14th century, population booms in the lower [[Yangtze River|Yangzi valley]] made Jiangxi, [[Jiangsu]] and Zhejiang the three most populous provinces for the Yuan name.<ref>Ibid, 196<U+2013>197.</ref> The southern coastal provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] also experienced significant increases.<ref>Ibid, 197.</ref> 

By the [[Qing Dynasty]], Yuan had penetrated to the frontier lands of [[Yunnan]] in the southwest, [[Guangxi]] in the south, [[Liaoning]] in the northeast and Taiwan in the southeast.<ref>Ibid, 197.</ref> Many in Guangdong and Fujian migrated south to Southeast Asia, especially [[Singapore]] and [[Indonesia]].<ref>Ibid, 197.</ref> 

Up until the 15th century, growth in the Yuan name consistently outstripped that of the general population, but this rate has fallen below average over the past six centuries. This period has seen a resurgence of the Yuan name in northern provinces, so much so that [[Sichuan]] and [[Hebei]] are now the most important in terms of absolute population.<ref>Ibid, 197.</ref> The Yuan name is most populous as a percentage of local populations in the [[Yangtze River Delta|Yangtze Delta]] region, in northwestern Jiangxi and in the border region between [[Shaanxi]] and Sichuan.<ref>Ibid, 197.</ref> As of 1994, for example, there were 97,400 Yuan in [[Shanghai]], ranked 30th by population - slightly higher than the national average.<ref>[http://www.grassy.org/art_cn/Names/name/yuan.htm <U+5411><U+5B59><U+53E3><U+5C71><U+6388><U+4E34><U+65F6><U+5927><U+603B><U+7EDF><U+5370><U+7684><U+4EBA><U+FF0C><U+5C31><U+662F><U+5B9D><U+5C71><U+8881><U+5E0C><U+6D1B>] ("Yuan Xiluo of [[Baoshan District|Baoshan]], who conferred the Presidential Seal upon [[Sun Yat-sen]]").

In Taiwan, the surname is ranked 94th by population. Most who hold the name were relatively [[mainlander|recent emigres]] who arrived during the 19th century or at the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949. They are concentrated in [[Taipei]], [[Hsinchu County|Hsinchu]], [[Nantou County|Nantou]], [[Chiayi County|Chiayi]] and [[Tainan County|Tainan]].<ref>Yuan Ziyou, [http://www.smartplan.com.cn/yuan/distribute.htm <U+8FC1><U+5F99><U+5206><U+5E03>] ("Migration and distribution") Retrieved 17 Nov. 2005.</ref>

=== Adoption by non-Han peoples ===
During the 2nd century, the Yuan surname was taken by one of the three tribal groupings of the [[Bandun Man]], who inhabited what is now [[Chongqing]] and [[Sichuan]]. This group later migrated north to the [[Wei River]] valley, and gradually were absorbed by [[Han Chinese]]. 

After [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei China|Emperor Xiaowen]] of the nomadic [[Xianbei]] moved his capital to [[Luoyang]] in 494, his clan of [[Tuoba]] changed their surname to Yuan (<U+5143>) to assimilate with the Chinese population. In later centuries, this surname declined and was sometimes subsumed by the more common form of Yuan (<U+8881>). 

The character of "''yuan''" (<U+8881>) has also been associated with the Gaoju people of [[Central Asia]], who claimed descent from the Xuanyuan clan of the [[Yellow Emperor|Huang Di]]. One of their nine clans was called Yuanhe (<U+8881><U+7D07>) or Yuanwei (<U+8881><U+97CB>), and one of their twelve major surnames was Qiyuan (<U+4E5E><U+8881>). In 605, the Yuanhe defeated the [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks|G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks]] and won leadership over a tribal confederation which came to be called the [[Huihe]] (<U+56DE><U+7D07>). There have been suggestions that the name of [[Genghis Khan]]'s tribe, [[Kiyad]] (called "Qiyan" <U+4E5E><U+984F> or "Qiyin" <U+4E5E><U+5F15> in [[Chinese language|Chinese]]), was a corruption of "Qiyuan".<ref>Suri Badalaha (1998) [http://www.xys.org/xys/ebooks/others/history/ancient/mongol/mongol2-4.txt <U+8499><U+53E4><U+65CF><U+65CF><U+6E90><U+65B0><U+8003>] ("New study of the origins of the [[Mongols]]"). Retrieved 16 Nov. 2005.</ref> Those among the Mongols who retained the Qiyuan surname may have simplified it to "Yuan" after settling in China.

During the early 17th century, during the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (Manchu) dynasty, the surname is also known to have been adopted by members of the [[Eight Banners]], including by a number of [[Manchu]] bannermen in [[Shenyang]]. Today, the surname appears among the Manchu, [[Mongol]]s, [[Yao people|Yao]], [[Yi people|Yi]], [[Bai]], [[Korean people|Korean]]s and [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]. There are major Yuan clans among the Yao in [[Long'an County|Long'an]] county, Guangxi and in [[Funing County|Funing]], Yunnan. 

The Yuan surname is a relatively minor one in [[Korea]], where it is called Won (<U+C6D0>). According to a 2000 census, there were 1,104 individuals bearing the name in [[South Korea]].<ref>[http://kosis.nso.go.kr/cgi-bin/sws_999.cgi?ID=DT_1INOOSB&IDTYPE=3 <U+D589><U+C815><U+AD6C><U+C5ED>(<U+AD6C><U+C2DC><U+AD70>)/<U+C131><U+C528><U+00B7><U+BCF8><U+AD00><U+BCC4> <U+AC00><U+AD6C> <U+BC0F> <U+C778><U+AD6C>] (2000 South Korean census results by surname and clan).

During the 20th century, the Won clan were concentrated on the southwestern coast of Korea, in the provinces of [[Chungcheongnam-do]], [[Gyeonggi-do]] and [[Jeollanam-do]].

== Genealogies ==
Almost all available information on the early origins of the surname come from noble [[genealogy|genealogies]] which were updated and maintained until the 10th century. Some of the aristocratic Yuan families of the [[Tang Dynasty]] used these registers as a means of upholding their prestige and maintaining influence. These texts were also used as sources for the 5th century story collection ''Shishuo xinyu'' (<U+4E16><U+8AAA><U+65B0><U+8A9E>: "New Tales of the World"). A Yuan clan genealogy from [[Jiangxi]] is mentioned in ''Sui shu'' (<U+968B><U+4E66>: "Book of Sui") and a Yuan clan temple inscription survives in the anthology of essayist and poet [[Han Yu]]. Although no copies of early genealogies are extant today, fragments have been preserved by famed Chinese historian [[Ouyang Xiu]] in the 11th century work ''[[Xin Tang shu]]''.<ref>Ouyang Xiu, note 4 at 3164<U+2013>3168.</ref>

From the time of Ouyang Xiu onwards, the practice of genealogy compilation devolved down to [[gentry]] families and became correspondingly more widespread. The clans of the [[Yangtze Delta]] and its hinterlands were most active in producing genealogies. Many of the Yuan clan genealogies associate their clans with the Ru'nan Yuan or the Chen Yuan, and in particular trace their ancestries to [[Yuan An]]. Yuan Zhijun (<U+8881><U+5FD7><U+541B>), founder of the Yuan clan of [[Dongguan]] and ancestor of the Ming dynasty general [[Yuan Chonghuan]] (<U+8881><U+5D07><U+7165>), for example, claimed to be a 38th generation descendent of Yuan An. A number of collateral branches in [[Xingning]], [[Meixian]] and [[Huiyang]] also follow the Tongguan clan in the claim. Similarly, the clans of [[Xinchang]], [[Fenghua]] and [[Yinxian]], which produced many ''[[jinshi]]'' degree holders in the [[Song Dynasty]], claimed that their ancestor Yuan Yuan (<U+8881><U+5143>) was a 31st generation descendant of Yuan An.<ref>Yuan Mingyi (ed.), ''Tangqi Yuan shi zongpu'' (<U+68E0><U+6EAA><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+5B97><U+8B5C>: "Genealogy of the Yuan clan of Tangqi") (1924), now held by [[Fenghua]] Municipal Government.</ref> It was not uncommon for clans to build memorial halls, sometimes titled "Ru'nan", "Woxue" (<U+5367><U+96EA>: "Sleeping in [time of] snow") or "Shouzheng" (<U+5B88><U+6B63>: "upholding justice"), in honour of Yuan An. Such attempts to trace the origin of clans to a famous individual have interest as a [[sociology|sociological]] phenomenon rather than for its historical accuracy.

Clan-based activities and genealogies were attacked during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when various movements inspired by the Chinese government attempted to eradicate symbols of the old society.  They were relatively successful, so much so that many genealogies have been lost. Most surviving Yuan genealogies on the mainland are now out of private hands. 

Some one hundred Yuan clan genealogies are known to be held in government archives or in public libraries in [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Ningbo]]. A provincial breakdown of the geographic distribution of these genealogies in order of number: [[Zhejiang]] (23); [[Jiangsu]] (22); [[Hunan]] (17); [[Jiangxi]] (9); [[Shandong]] (9); [[Sichuan]] (5); [[Henan]] (4); [[Anhui]] (3); unknown (7).<ref>Yuan Ziyou, [http://www.yuanscn.com/notes.htm <U+5BB6><U+8C31><U+4FEE><U+7F2E><U+53C2><U+8003><U+8D44><U+6599><U+76EE><U+5F55>] ("List of genealogy compilation resources"). Retrieved 16 Nov. 2005.</ref> A few genealogies may also be held in university archives in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. No doubt many more fragments are scattered in villages and townships across China.

== Clan organisation ==
From around the [[Song Dynasty]], clans began organising themselves in mutual obligation relationships, often based around the compilation of genealogies. The role of clan elders was often that of moral or [[Confucianism|Confucian]] instruction. The ''Yuan shi shi fan'' (<U+8881><U+6C0F><U+4E16><U+8303>: "Yuan clan hereditary rules"), by the Song Dynasty ''[[jinshi]]'' [[Yuan Cai]] (<U+8881><U+91C7>), was an early manual of [[ethical]] behaviour and was regarded by contemporaries as a classic of clan instruction.<ref>See Yuan Tsai (Yuan Cai), ''Family and property in Sung China: Y<U+00FC>an Ts'ai's Precepts for social life'', translated, with annotations and introduction by Patricia Buckley Ebrey (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1984).</ref> Toward the [[late imperial China|late imperial]] period, these relationships strengthened to the extent that clans sometimes provided [[social welfare]] and enforced [[customary law]]. Regionally prominent clans often allied together based on a common (and sometimes spurious) ancestor, known as the "first ancestor who moved" (<U+59CB><U+9077><U+7956>). 

Renewed interest since the late 1980s by [[overseas Chinese]] in root-seeking has been largely encouraged by the government of [[mainland China]] as a way of attracting [[foreign direct investment]]. In 2001, for example, the Hong Kong Association of Yuen Clansmen (<U+9999><U+6E2F><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+5B97><U+89AA><U+6703>) donated [[HKD]] $1.2 million toward the construction of a [[Yuan Chonghuan]] Memorial Park on the site of his [[Ming Dynasty]] home.<ref>Yang Ge, [http://www.southcn.com/news/gdnews/hotspot/qhch/whx/200409130109.htm <U+8881><U+5D07><U+7115><U+6545><U+91CC><U+5F18><U+626C><U+82F1><U+96C4><U+7CBE><U+795E>] ("Propagating a heroic spirit in the hometown of [[Yuan Chonghuan]]"), ''Southern Daily'', 13 September 2004. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2005.</ref> In 2004, a group of 68 Yuan clan businessmen from [[Shenzhen]] and [[Hong Kong]] were invited to Ru'nan county, so-called "[[ancestral home]] of all Yuan under Heaven". The group, led by [[Yuen Mo]], a representative of Hong Kong to the [[National People's Congress]], held talks with provincial and local officials with regard to the development of food processing projects in the area.<ref>Liang Wensheng, [http://www.hnsc.com.cn/news/396/2004/10/29/25781.htm  <U+9999><U+6E2F><U+5E7F><U+4E1C><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+77E5><U+540D><U+4EBA><U+58EB><U+5230><U+6C5D><U+5357><U+5BFB><U+6839>] ("Prominent Yuan of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Guangdong]] in search of roots in Ru'nan"), ''Zhumadian Daily'', 29 October 2004. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2005.</ref>

In recent years, genealogy compilation and clan organisation has seen a resurgence, together with a renewed interest in [[local history]]. The 13th "Conference of the Descendants of Shun," held in Ru'nan in 1999, was attended by representatives of Yuan clans from as far afield as [[Hong Kong]] and [[Thailand]].<ref>[http://www.zmdw.org.cn/xqzx/rn/rnfw12.htm <U+5929><U+4E0B><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+5F52><U+6C5D><U+5357>] ("Yuan of the world return to Ru'nan"), 2003. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2005.</ref> A number of local clans are also reorganising themselves and publishing updated versions of their genealogies. In May 2005, after updating their 1939 genealogy, the Yuan clan of Ximen, [[Ningbo]], held a large scale [[ancestor worship]] ceremony which was much publicised in the local media.<ref>Jiang Heng, [http://www.cnnb.com.cn/gb/node2/channel/node13890/node14006/node14008/userobject7ai1104475.html <U+5B81><U+6CE2><U+897F><U+95E8><U+8881><U+6C0F><U+4E00><U+65CF><U+5C81><U+6708><U+60A0><U+60A0>] ("Carefree times for the Yuan clan of Ximen, Ningbo") ''Ningbo China Net'' 29 April 2005. Retrieved 17 Nov. 2005.</ref> This return to clan consciousness has been limited, however, by increased geographic and social mobility in China.
