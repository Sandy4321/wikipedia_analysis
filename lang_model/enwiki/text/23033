'''David Gottlieb''' (* [[1911]]; <U+2020>  [[1982]]),  a professor of plant pathology at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] ([[1946]]-[[1982]]), was a pioneer in the field of fungi physiology and antibiotics for plants.

Gottlieb is best known for isolation in the 1940s of the strain of Streptomyces from which [[chloramphenicol]] was developed<ref>[http://apsnet.org/members/phyto/2004/11/041101.pdf Nov 2004 ''Phytopathology News'', Vol. 38, No. 11, p.154]</ref>, for his mentoring in the field, and for his editorial work.<ref>[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.py.12.031904.100001 Editor for the ''Annual Review of Phytopathology'', 1969-1974]</ref>
