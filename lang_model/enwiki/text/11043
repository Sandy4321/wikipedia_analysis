'''Lightning Bar''' (1951<U+2013>1960) was an [[American Quarter Horse]] who [[Horse racing|raced]] and subsequently became a [[horse breeding|breeding]] stallion.  He was bred by his lifelong owner Art Pollard of [[Sonoita, Arizona]], and was the offspring of [[Three Bars]], a [[Thoroughbred]], and Della P, a Quarter Horse mare from Louisiana, then noted for the breeding of sprint horses.  Lightning Bar raced ten times, achieving four victories and four other top three finishes. His racing career was cut short by illness after only one year, following which he spent two years as a show horse.  As a breeding stallion he sired seven crops, or years, of [[foal]]s, among whom [[Doc Bar]] was the best known.  In 1960 Lightning Bar died of an intestinal infection at the age of nine.  He was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Association]]'s (AQHA) [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] in 2008.

==Early life==

[[Glossary of equestrian terms#F|Foaled]], or born, in 1951, Lightning Bar was bred to be a race horse, but injuries and bouts of illnesses kept him from racing past the age of two.<ref name=HOFarticle/> His breeder, Art Pollard, owned him for the horse's entire life.<ref name=Get>American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) ''Official Get of Sire Record for Lightning Bar''.</ref> Lightning Bar was sired by Three Bars, a Thoroughbred [[stallion]] later inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame. His dam was Della P, a daughter of the Thoroughbred stallion Doc Horn. His [[Glossary of equestrian terms#S|second dam]], or maternal grandmother, was a mare who was never given a name, sired by Old D. J.<ref name=LB143/> Art Pollard purchased Della P from "Dink" Parker for $1,750 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1750|1948|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) in the late 1940s.<ref name=LB143/>{{Inflation-fn|US}} Della P was bred in Louisiana, a leader in breeding short distance racehorses between 1900 and 1940,<ref name=Two55>Denhardt ''Quarter Horses'' p. 55.</ref> and was taken to Arizona by Parker.<ref name=LB143>Simmons "Lightning Bar" ''Legends 2'' p. 143.</ref> 

When Lightning Bar was about five days old Pollard was afraid that he had leg problems and was [[Equine conformation#Conformation of the front and hind legs|buck-kneed]], and considered putting the [[colt (horse)|colt]] to sleep. He sought Parker's advice, and as Pollard later related the story, "Dink just looked at me and shook his head. 'Ain't you ever gonna learn nothing? That colt's just what you're looking for.'&nbsp;"<ref name=LB145>Simmons "Lightning Bar" ''Legends 2'' p. 145.</ref> When mature, the [[Sorrel (horse)|sorrel]]-colored<ref name=Get/> Lightning Bar stood {{hands|15.2}} tall and weighed about {{convert|1250|lb|kg}}.<ref name=LB146/>

==Racing and show career==
Lightning Bar started on the racetrack ten times, winning four races, coming in second three times, and third once. Among those finishes, he ran second and third in two [[stakes race]]s,<ref name=Get/> a type of race for higher quality horses with a higher payout.<ref name=Dict200>Price and Shiers ''Lyons Press Horseman's Dictionary'' p. 200.</ref> His total earnings on the track were $1,491 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1491|1953|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),<ref name=Get/>{{Inflation-fn|US}} and his highest [[speed index]], or comparative rating of his speed, was AAA,<ref name=Get/> the highest achievable at the time.<ref name=DigestA8>Wagoner ''Quarter Racing Digest'' p. A-8.</ref> Lightning Bar raced for only one year, as he suffered from bouts of [[pneumonia]], [[strangles]], and [[Lameness (equine)|leg injuries]]. He equalled one track record for two-year-olds at the [[Los Angeles County Fair]] race meeting in [[Pomona, California]], running {{convert|330|yd|m}} in 17.2&nbsp;seconds.<ref name=LB146>Simmons "Lightning Bar" ''Legends 2'' p. 146.</ref> 

After his racing career Lightning Bar went on to become a [[Horse show|show horse]], earning 18&nbsp;open [[halter (horse show)|halter]] points with the AQHA, and an [[American Quarter Horse Association#Horse shows and rodeos|AQHA Champion]] award in 1955.<ref name=Get/> He won one grand championship and one reserve championship in halter classes at recognized AQHA shows.<ref name=LB146/>

==Breeding career==

The first year Lightning Bar stood as a breeding stallion his [[stud fee]], the amount charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|250|1954|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) but only nine [[mare]]s were bred to him.{{Inflation-fn|US}}<ref name=LB146/> The next year, he bred 11&nbsp;mares, but in 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|500|1956|r=-2}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) each.{{Inflation-fn|US}}<ref name=LB146/> One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting one of his ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot [[Team Roping|roping]]. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. I asked him how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.'&nbsp;"<ref name=LB147>Simmons "Lightning Bar" ''Legends 2'' p. 147.</ref>{{efn|Roping requires a horse that can accelerate quickly, going from standing to {{convert|30|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in a few seconds.<ref name=Western98>Strickland ''Competing in Western Shows & Events'' p. 98.</ref>}}

Pollard said of Lightning Bar that "I always had to be careful about the kind of latch I used on a gate with that horse. He could figure them out faster than I could. He would open a gate, and go for a stroll."<ref name=LB149/> Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight breeding seasons, and 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. Of his foals, 108&nbsp;started races, and 77&nbsp;won, earning a total of $476,949.{{efn|No inflation adjusted earnings figures are given for the earnings of his foals as the foals raced over a number of years, making the inflation adjustment unreliable.}} The most successful of his foals, Lightning Belle, earned $60,134 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|60134|1963|r=-3}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name=Get/>{{Inflation-fn|US}}

Five of Lightning Bar's foals earned AQHA Championships: Cactus Comet, Crash Bang, Lightning Rey, Pana Bar and Relampago Bar; Lightning Rey earned a Supreme Championship. In addition, Lightning Bar's offspring earned $1,163.32 in [[National Cutting Horse Association]] sanctioned [[Cutting (sport)|cattle cutting]] competitions,<ref name=Get/>{{efn|No inflation adjusted earnings figures are given for the earnings of his foals as the foals showed over a number of years, making the inflation adjustment unreliable.}} and four earned a [[American Quarter Horse Association#Horse shows and rodeos|Superior Halter Horse]] title from the AQHA.<ref name=Pitzer72>Pitzer ''Most Influential Quarter Horse Sires'' p. 72.</ref>

==Death and legacy==

Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from [[colitis-X]],<ref name=LB149/> a disease of unknown origin that can kill rapidly and without warning.<ref name=Dict113>Belknap ''Horsewords'' p. 113.</ref> It infected many of Pollard's horses; of those affected only three survived. Heartbroken, Pollard sold his remaining stock and did not return to the Quarter Horse business for 15&nbsp;years. He said later that "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses."<ref name=LB149>Simmons "Lightning Bar" ''Legends 2'' p. 149.</ref> Another time, Pollard remarked that "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar."<ref name=Complete283>Nye ''Complete Book of the Quarter Horse'' p. 283.</ref>

Lightning Bar was inducted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2008.<ref name=HOFarticle>Staff "Hall of Fame: Inductees Represent the Best of AQHA" ''Quarter Horse Journal'' p. 48.</ref> His most famous son was Doc Bar, who was also inducted into the Hall of Fame.<ref name=HOFarticle/> Lightning Bar's daughter Glamour Bars was the dam of [[Impressive (horse)|Impressive]], who became well known as one of the leading sires of halter horses.<ref name=LB148>Simmons "Lightning Bar" ''Legends 2'' p. 148.</ref> Two stakes races were run in Lightning Bar's memory, the first at [[Los Alamitos Race Course|Los Alamitos Race track]] in California for one year in 1961. The second ran from 1962 to 1966 at [[Ruidoso Downs]] in New Mexico.<ref name=QRSH1HE53>Smelker ''Quarter Racing Stakes Horses I'' History of Events section, p. 53.</ref>
