[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John G. Roberts|John Roberts]] administered the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]] to Obama. Michelle Obama held the [[Lincoln Bible|Bible]], which was used in 1861 by [[Abraham Lincoln]] at his first inauguration, for President Obama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/obama-to-take-oath-on-same-bible-as-lincoln/|title=Obama to Take Oath on Same Bible as Lincoln|author=Seelye, Katherine Q.|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-12-23}}</ref> Obama also mentioned several weeks earlier that he wanted to use his full name for his swearing-in ceremony, including his [[middle name]] [[Husayn|Hussein]], in "follow[ing] the tradition, not trying to make a statement one way or the other."<ref name=ItRNBfUD>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,467607,00.html|title=Obama to Resurrect Middle Name for Inauguration Day|accessdate=2008-12-21|date=2008-12-16|publisher=FOX News Network, LLC|work=[[FOX News]]|author=}}</ref> His middle name had caused some controversy during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|election]] campaign when detractors tried to imply an association between Obama and [[Iraq|Iraqi]] dictator [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=IBHODSS/>

As requested previously by then President-elect Obama, Roberts ended the presidential oath with the phrase "so help you God," and Obama responded "so help me God." Roberts congratulated Obama as the new President at the end of the oath.<ref name="oathflub"/><ref name="Mears">{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/09/obama-to-asked-to-say-so-help-me-god-at-swearing-in/|title=Obama has asked to say 'so help me God' at swearing-in|author=Mears, Bill|publisher=CNN|date=2009-01-09}}</ref>

====Missteps while administering the oath====
The administration of the oath included several missteps, although conflicting news accounts abound about the exact sequence of events. According to one news report, as Roberts administered the first part of the presidential oath, he paused after saying "I, Barack Hussein Obama." As Obama began to repeat those words, Roberts continued on with the oath by reciting "do solemnly swear," interrupting the President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28753348/|title=Roberts and Obama seal deal, with a stumble|publisher=AP via MSN.com}}</ref> According to a different news report, it was Obama who interrupted Roberts during his recitation of the first part of the oath.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/O/OBAMA_OATH_DO_OVER?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|title=Obama takes presidential oath _ again|date=January 21, 2009|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref> 

Following the completion of the first phrase of the presidential oath, Roberts recited the next part of the oath incorrectly, by stating, "that I will execute the Office of President ''to'' the United States ''faithfully''" (rather than "that I will ''faithfully'' execute the Office of President ''of'' the United States"). Obama recited the words "I will execute," and then paused, apparently noticing the error, and looked at Roberts.<ref name=BBC /> Roberts then tried to correct his mistake in administering the oath by reciting "faithfully the Office of President of the United States." However, Obama repeated Roberts' first mistaken phrase. <ref name="oathflub">{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Williams |title=About That oath flub |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/01/20/1751351.aspx |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=January 20, 2008 |accessdate=January 21, 2009 }}</ref>

Although [[White House press secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] indicated initially that President Obama did not plan to retake the oath of office,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/01/21/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4744187.shtml|title=No Plans For Obama To Retake Oath|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}</ref> Chief Justice John Roberts agreed to re-administer the oath to Obama at the request of [[White House counsel]].

According to a statement issued by White House counsel [[Greg Craig]], the oath was re-administered on January 21, 2009 "out of an abundance of caution." Referring to the oath as administered on January 20, 2009, Craig added that "the oath of office was administered effectively and ... the President was sworn in appropriately ...

A central theme of President Barack Obama's [[inaugural address]] was a call to restore responsibility <U+2014> both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/20/barack-obama-inauguration-us-speech|title=Obama inauguration: Words of history ... crafted by 27-year-old in Starbucks|publisher=The Guardian|date=2009-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/18/responsibility-theme-obamas-inauguration-speech-aides-say/|title=Responsibility is the Theme of Obama's Inauguration Speech, Aides Say"|publisher=FOXNews.com|date=2009-01-18}}</ref> Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases; instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.<ref name=mackin>{{cite web|url=http://tulane.edu/news/newwave/012309_inaugural_address.cfm|title=Inaugural Speech Focuses on Tradition|publisher=''New Wave''|date=2009-01-23}}</ref>

Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying, "we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents." The speech reinforced words such as "legacy" and "heritage," as well as values such as "honesty," "courage" and "patriotism," which "are old." Near the end of the speech, Obama referred to words written by [[Thomas Paine]] in ''[[The American Crisis]]'', which were ordered by [[George Washington]] to be read to his troops: "Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive...that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." Because Obama's [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|campaign]] message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.<ref name=mackin/>

As part of Obama's call for responsibility, he said "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account" and "what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility <U+2014> a recognition, on the part of every American." Obama also quoted the lyrics of the [[Jerome Kern]] and [[Dorothy Fields]] song [[Pick Yourself Up]] from the [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[Swing Time (1936 film)|''Swing Time'']], saying that "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."<ref name="boston_globe">[http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2009/01/obama_calls_for_3.html Obama calls for American renewal], posted by Foon Rhee, deputy national political editor, in "Political Intelligence" column, January 20, 2009, [[Boston Globe]]</ref> In an article for the ''The New York Times'', columnist and former drama critic [[Frank Rich]] noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address "one subtle whiff of the [[Great Depression]]."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/opinion/25rich.html?em "No Time for Poetry"] by Frank Rich, ''The New York Times'' 1-25-09 p.

===Inaugural luncheon===
Before the [[luncheon]] and in keeping with tradition, President Obama entered the President's Room in the Capitol building, where he signed his first Presidential orders. The first order signed by President Obama was a proclamation "declaring a day of national renewal and reconciliation." During the historic signing, Obama joked about his [[left-handedness]] and also quipped, "I was told not to swipe the pen." He also signed orders officially presenting his [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Cabinet]] and several sub-Cabinet officials to Congress for their approval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/20/obama-signs-first-presidential-proclamation/|title=Obama signs first presidential proclamation|source=CNN|date=2009-01-20|accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref>

[[File:2009 Obama inaugural luncheon first course China.jpg|thumb|China used for the first course of the inaugural luncheon]]

Obama then joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in [[National Statuary Hall]] at the U.S. Capitol. Guests, who included top Washington lawmakers as well as former Presidents and Vice Presidents, were served [[duck]] and [[pheasant]] with [[Pinot Noir]].<ref name=thehill> {{cite news |first=Mike|last=Soraghan|title=Obama<U+2019>s Inauguration makes tourists out of lawmakers |url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/obamas-inauguration-makes-tourists-out-of-lawmakers-2009-01-20.html |work= [[The Hill]] |publisher=|date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref> The theme of the luncheon was based on Obama's 2009 inaugural theme, "A New Birth of Freedom," which commemorated the [[Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial|bicentennial]] of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s birth.<ref name=thehill/> The red and white china were copies of those used in the Lincoln White House.<ref name=thehill/>

A luncheon at the Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the inaugural luncheon often featured dishes that were representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, with the 2009 menu including seafood stew, a pheasant and duck dish and apple cinnamon [[sponge cake]] with sweet cream glac<U+00E9> for dessert. Since 1985, a painting has been chosen to serve as a backdrop for the head table. In 2009, the featured painting was [[Thomas Hill (painter)|Thomas Hill's]] 1865 ''View of the Yosemite Valley'', a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the [[Yosemite National Park#Yosemite Grant|Yosemite Grant]], which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inaugural.senate.gov/luncheon/|title= Inauguration of the President: Luncheon|publisher=[[Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|JCCIC]]}}

No official count was taken of the number of people attending the inauguration ceremony, although multiple sources concluded it was the highest attended event ever held in Washington, D.C. Government agencies and federal officials that coordinated security and traffic management determined the attendance count to be 1.8 million, based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported the number and the [[National Park Service]] said it did "not contest" the estimate.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite-news | last=Ruane | first=Michael | title=D.C.'s Inauguration Head Count: 1.8 Million | accessdate= 2009-01-22|date= 2009-01-20| work=[[Washington Post]] | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012103884.html}}</ref><ref name="bostonglobe-attendance">{{cite-news | last= | first= | title=Inaugural crowd size reportedly D.C. record | accessdate= 2009-01-22|date= 2009-01-22| work=[[The Boston Globe]] | url = http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/01/22/inaugural_crowd_size_reportedly_dc_record/}}</ref>

Unlike political campaigns, an individual or corporation could contribute to an inaugural celebration without legal restrictions on the amount of the donation. However, Obama's Presidential Inauguration Committee, which included [[Penny Pritzker]], [[John W. Rogers, Jr.]], [[Pat Ryan (executive)|Pat Ryan]], [[William Daley]] and [[Julianna Smoot]] as members, set a $50,000 contribution limit. To underscore its commitment to change business as usual, the inauguration committee did not accept donations from [[Political action committee|PACs]], federally registered [[lobbyists]] and corporations.<ref>
