"'''Too Far'''" is a song recorded by Australian recording artist and songwriter [[Kylie Minogue]] taken from her sixth studio album ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997). It was written by Minogue herself while production was handled by British duo [[Brothers in Rhythm]] and Minogue, and composing was by Steve Anderson. The song was recorded at DMC, Real World and Sarm West Studios in [[London, England]] where Minogue had constantly collaborated with producers and songwriters in that location.

"Too Far" is an [[drum and bass]]-influenced track. The lyrical content discusses Minogues [[frustration]] and [[anger]]. Minogue recalled writing the song at a local cafe down from where she was living. "Too Far" was praised from most music critics. Many critics had highlighted the song as an album standout and praised the production standards and composition. Minogue has performed the track twice on two of her concert tours; [[Intimate and Live Tour]] and [[Anti Tour]], and both performance received positive commentary for its retrospective performance.

Minogue begun work on her sixth studio album and had greater freedom in both songwriting and composing.

==Single release==
Deconstruction planned to release a [[Single (music)|lead single]] in January 1997, but Hadfield was concerned with the quality of most of the songs.<ref name="Kylie"/> This led to reproducing new music to make the album "perfect", and a potential January release was postponed until May.<ref name="Kylie"/> Hadfield was unimpressed with the new improvements and a May release and a back-up September release were all scrapped.<ref name="Kylie"/> Minogue wanted to release "[[Limbo (Kylie Minogue song)|Limbo]]" as the lead single from the studio album.<ref name="Kylie"/> She believed that the sound was strong and "radio friendly".<ref name="Kylie"/> However, Anderson did not agree with her choice and believed that either "Too Far" or "Jump" had represented the album more that her decision.<ref name="linernotes"/> After their discussion for a single, both parties disagreed with each others choices and left Deconstruction to decide on the single. However, Deconstruction did not believe any songs they decided were suitable, so instead issued it as a B-side to the newly decided lead single "Some Kind of Bliss".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/falling_music/kylieminogue.htm |title=::: Sweet Music ::: Music for Music Lovers - Music news : |publisher=Freewebs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-28}}</ref>
