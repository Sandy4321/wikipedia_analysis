The '''Wiesen Viaduct''' (or Wiesener Viaduct; {{lang-de|Wiesener Viadukt}}) is a single track [[limestone]] [[rail transport|railway]] [[viaduct]].  It spans the [[Landwasser River]] southwest of the hamlet of [[Wiesen, Switzerland|Wiesen]], in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Canton]] of [[Graub<U+00FC>nden]], [[Switzerland]].

Designed by the then Chief Engineer of the [[Rhaetian Railway]], Henning Friedrich, it was built between 1906 and 1909 under the supervision of another engineer, Hans Studer.  The Rhaetian Railway still owns and uses it today.

An important element of the [[Rhaetian Railway#Davos<U+2013>Filisur line|Davos<U+2013>Filisur railway]], the viaduct is {{convert|88|m}} high, {{convert|204|m}} long, and has a main span of {{convert|55|m}}.

==Location==
The Wiesen Viaduct forms part of the Davos<U+2013>Filisur railway section between [[Wiesen (Rhaetian Railway station)|Wiesen]] and [[Filisur (Rhaetian Railway station)|Filisur]]<!--, and is at the {{convert||km}} mark from [[Landquart (Rhaetian Railway station)|Landquart]]-->.  Just {{convert|300|m}} southwest of Wiesen railway station, it has, on its south side, a separate pedestrian bridge giving hikers access to [[Filisur]].  At the western end of the viaduct is a non functioning [[:de:Hippsche Wendescheibe|Hippsche turning wheel]].

==History==
The Wiesen Viaduct structure was designed by the then Chief Engineer of the Rhaetian Railway, Henning Friedrich.  Construction began in October 1906, under the direction of another engineer, Hans Studer. With the launch of the Davos<U+2013>Filisur railway in July 1909, the viaduct came into operation.  It cost a total of 324,000 [[Swiss francs]] to build.

The [[falsework]] used for the building of the viaduct was designed by G. Marasi, swallowed up around {{convert|500|m3}} of wood, and was constructed by the Graub<U+00FC>nden carpenter [[:de:Richard Coray|Richard Coray]].

In 1926, the viaduct was the inspiration for [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]'s painting ''Br<U+00FC>cke bei Wiesen''.

==Technical data==
The Wiesen Viaduct is {{convert|88|m}} high and {{convert|204|m}} long.  Its main span is only {{convert|3.7|m}} in width, but also {{convert|55|m}} long, which makes it [[List of longest masonry arch bridge spans|one of the longest main spans]] of any masonry bridge.

To the west of the main span are two arches, each {{convert|20|m}} long.  East of the main span are four arches, each of them also {{convert|20|m}} long.

These technical characteristics combine to make the Wiesen Viaduct the Rhaetian Railway's largest stone bridge.
