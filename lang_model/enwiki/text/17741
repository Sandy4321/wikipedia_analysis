The '''Tri-State Tollway''' is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[toll road]] maintained by the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] in northeastern [[Illinois]]. It is actually a combination of three different Interstates:
*[[Interstate 80]] between [[Interstate 94]] at [[Thornton, Illinois|Thornton]] and Interstate 294 near [[Hazel Crest, Illinois|Hazel Crest]]
*[[Interstate 294]], which is routed on top of Interstate 80 to Hazel Crest, and then turns north to [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]]
*[[Interstate 94]] north from Deerfield to [[U.S. Route 41]]

The segment containing Interstate 294 is 53 miles (85 km) long; in total, the Tri-State Tollway is actually about 78 miles (126 km) long. Only the [[Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway]] is longer in length. Despite its name, the Tri-State Tollway does not enter either Indiana or Wisconsin. On the Indiana side, the Tri-State Tollway ends three miles away from the Indiana border and continues as the [[Kingery Expressway]]; however both the Kingery and the Indiana portion, which was later named the [[Borman Expressway]], were known as the Tri-State Highway before the Tollway was completed. On the Wisconsin side, the Tri-State Tollway ends just before the border at [[U.S. Route 41]]. The road continues as [[Interstate 94]]/[[U.S. Route 41]] to [[Milwaukee]].

[[Image:TriStateTollway.jpg|250px|thumb|Interstate 294 in [[Indian Head Park, Illinois|Indian Head Park]], one-half mile south of the Hinsdale Oasis.]]
For being a relatively short highway, the Tri-State Tollway has numerous notable features and oddities.

* Over-the-road [[Illinois Tollway oasis|Oases]] &mdash; These oases are a part of the entire tollway system, but the most are on the Tri-State Tollway. They provide food and gas without having to exit the tollway proper.
* Pay-as-you-go tolling &mdash; Like all Illinois tollways, rather than getting an entry ticket and paying upon exiting the tollway, drivers pay a flat toll at toll barriers along the main line (typically every 10 miles south of O'Hare). There are also automated toll collection lanes at some exits and entrances. 
* [[Open road tolling]] &mdash; Open road tolling allows the automatic collection of tolls via an [[I-Pass]], without the need to slow down or stop at a toll booth. 
* [[Thornton Quarry]] &mdash; About 0.75 mile (1200 m) of the highway crosses a quarry being converted into a large lake for overflow storm water. (See the [[Deep Tunnel]] project.) Currently, the road's elevation over the floor of the quarry is up to 100 feet (30 m) deep on both sides of the highway, making for a unique view.

* No direct interchange with [[Interstate 57]] &mdash; Despite the fact that these two highways cross paths and there is room for an interchange to be built, I-57 is the only [[Chicagoland]] highway that cannot be directly accessed from the Tri-State Tollway.

* [[Six Flags Great America]] &mdash; an amusement park in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].

The Edens Spur is a 5 mile (8 km) cutover from the Tri-State Tollway to the [[Edens Expressway]]. It connects the [[Interstate 94]] portions of the tollway and the Edens Expressway. It is technically a [[toll road]].

Northbound traffic on the Edens Expressway has the option of cutting over to the northbound Tri-State Tollway, or remaining on [[U.S. Highway 41]] ([[Skokie Highway]]). Southbound traffic on the Tri-State Tollway has the option of cutting over to the southbound Edens Expressway, or remaining on the Tri-State Tollway on the loop [[Interstate 294]]. There are no other ways to enter the Edens Spur at the ends.

There is one exit eastbound on the Edens Spur at [[Illinois Route 43]] (Waukegan Road). There is also an entrance ramp to the Edens Spur westbound at that point.

The spur has one toll barrier, as it is still part of the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority|Illinois toll highway]] system. This toll plaza has been upgraded and now has ([[I-Pass]]) open tolling lanes, which have eliminated most congestion at this toll.

==Lingo==
Portions of the Tri-State Tollway are referred to in somewhat archaic language during traffic reports and casual conversation. The following are the most common, from south to north:
* '''Thornton Quarry''' &mdash; on I-80/294 just west of [[Halsted Street]], the bridge over the aforementioned Thornton Quarry.
* '''Mile-Long Bridge''' &mdash; on I-294 between [[Stevenson Expressway|I-55]] and La Grange Road, the bridge over the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]], the [[Des Plaines River]], a large portion of the [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] [[intermodal freight transport|transmodal]] facility, a few rail lines, and some [[Commonwealth Edison]] power lines.
* '''Grand Avenue Curve''' &mdash; The curve immediately south of the Bensenville Bridge (see below). This portion of the tollway functions as a long S-curve, causing delays due to limited visibility beyond both curves.
* '''[[Bensenville, IL|Bensenville]] Bridge''' &mdash; on I-294 just south of [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]], the bridge over the Metra Milwaukee District West line and Mannheim Road (U.S. 12/45). 
* '''The Water Tower''' &mdash; on I-294, a water tower by Willow Road.

==History==
The Tri-State Tollway was built in the mid- to late 1950s as a bypass of Chicago, as the [[Indiana Toll Road]]-[[Chicago Skyway]] (opened in 1956) ran towards downtown. The first section opened [[August 28]], [[1958]], running from Wisconsin south to and east along the [[Edens Spur]]. The rest of the road, from the Edens Spur south to the [[Bishop Ford Freeway|Calumet Expressway]] and [[Kingery Expressway]], opened [[December 23]] of the same year. It was at first marked as '''U.S. Highway 41 Toll''', which continued east on the Kingery Expressway (now [[I-80]]/[[I-94]]) to Calumet Avenue ([[US 41]]) in [[Hammond, Indiana]], and ended at the north end of the Tollway, where it merges with US 41. It was also marked as [[U.S. Highway 30 Toll]] between its south end (the Calumet Expressway was [[U.S. Highway 30 (Chicago)|U.S. Highway 30 Alternate]]) and the [[East-West Tollway]]. In 1959 the Tollway was designated as parts of I-94 and I-294, and the short [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with I-80 was assigned.

In [[1998]], the authority removed the entire multilane Deerfield Toll Plaza on the Tri-State, then considered one of the worst snags on the tollway system. To make up for the lost tolls, the Tollway Authority built the Huehl Road Toll Plaza on the Edens Spur to charge traffic that followed Interstate 94 into Chicago. In addition, tolls at the Waukegan Toll Plaza were increased, and additional toll plazas built on exits south of Deerfield at Lake-Cook Road, Willow Road and Golf Road ([[Illinois Route 58]]). Toll collection facilities were also added to entrance ramps to the northbound Tri-State at those points.

==Rebuild and widen projects==
{{future infrastructure}}
By the year 2010, numerous portions of the Tri-State Tollway are scheduled to have been rebuilt and/or widened under the authority of the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]]. Various portions of the tollway are scheduled for completion throughout 2007-2009, with several already being completed. Plans for the Tri-State Tollway include three major projects: South Tri-State Tollway Rebuild & Widen, Central Tri-State Tollway Rebuild & Widen, and North Tri-State Tollway Rebuild & Widen.
 
===South Tri-State Tollway===
In early 2005, road work began to rebuild and widen a 17.6 mile stretch of the Tri-State Tollway from [[Illinois Route 394]] in [[South Holland, Illinois|South Holland]] to 95th St. in [[Oak Lawn, Illinois|Oak Lawn]].

The project is divided into two phases. Phase I includes the portion from Route 394 to 167th Street and was completed in late 2006. Phase II includes 159th Street to 95th Street and began in 2007. <ref>[http://www.illinoistollway.com/portal/pls/portal/url/PAGE/Tollway/TrafficConst/TrafficConst_Projects_Roadway/TrafficConst_Tristate_Projects/TrafficConst_South_Tristate Illinois Tollway: South Tri-State Tollway (I-294) Phase II Rebuild & Widen]</ref>

===Central Tri-State Tollway=== 
In early 2007, construction began to rebuild and widen a 4.5 mile portion of I-294 from Balmoral Ave. to Dempster St., north of which construction will continue as part of the North Tri-State Tollway plan. Once completed, this project will widen the tollway to four lanes in each direction. <ref name="central">[http://www.illinoistollway.com/portal/pls/portal/url/PAGE/Tollway/TrafficConst/TrafficConst_Projects_Roadway/TrafficConst_Tristate_Projects/TrafficConst_Central_Tristate Illinois Tollway: Central Tri-State Tollway (I-294), Rebuild & Widen...]</ref>

Work on the northbound lanes is scheduled through mid-2008, and work on the southbound lanes will is scheduled to begin in late spring 2008. The project is scheduled to be completed by late 2009.<ref name="central"/>

===North Tri-State Tollway=== 
In early 2007, road work began to rebuild and widen parts of the tollway from Dempster St. to the Illinois/Wisconsin state line. The plan calls for the rebuilding and widening of I-294 from Dempster St. to Lake-Cook Road, the rebuilding and widening of I-94 from [[Illinois Route 22|Half Day Rd.]] to Grand Ave., and the rebuilding of I-94 from Grand Ave. to near the state line. [[Noise barrier|Noisewalls]] or sightscreens will also be added at various points along the toll road. <ref>[http://www.illinoistollway.com/portal/pls/portal/url/PAGE/Tollway/TrafficConst/TrafficConst_Projects_Roadway/TrafficConst_Tristate_Projects/TrafficConst_NTri_Widen North Tri-State Tollway (I-294/94) Rebuild & Widen Project]</ref>

== Interchanges ==
The [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] numbers toll plazas, including plazas on exit ramps. Exits are not marked on overhead signs as of 2006. In the exit number column, below, only the exits indicated as exits of [[Image:I-80.svg|20px]] or [[Image:I-94.svg|20px]] have exit numbers on the signs.
