'''Operation Chequerboard''' was a high-altitude military exercise conducted by India along the [[China|Chinese]] border in North East [[India]].  The exercise was conducted to test Indian military response in the Northeast Himalayan region and the [[US]] and [[USSR|Soviet]] reaction to potential Sino-Indian tensions in the region.  The Chinese and Indian armies nearly went to war as both sides patrolled the desolate frontier and skirmishes were not infrequent.

The exercise involved 10 divisions of the [[Indian Army]] and several [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] of the [[Indian_Air_Force|IAF]] and a redeployment of troops at several places in North East India. The Indian Army moved 3 divisions to positions around [[Wangdung]] <ref>"Disputed Legacy", India Today, May 15, 1988.</ref>, where they were supplied and maintained solely by air. These troop reinforcements were over and above the 50,000 troops already present across [[Arunachal Pradesh]] <ref>"Eye-witness in Tibet", Far Eastern Economic Review, June 4, 1987.</ref>.  The military exercise coincided with statements from India's Chief of Army Staff [[General K. Sundarj|General K. Sundarji]] that India recognizes the major boundary differences with China and Indian deployments are intended to give [[Beijing]] the benefit of the doubt<ref>George Perkovich, "Nuclear Capabilities Grow," India's Nuclear Bomb: The Impact on Global Proliferation (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1999), p. 289.</ref>.
