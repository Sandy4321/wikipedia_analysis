The '''1964 Alaska earthquake''', known also as the '''Great Alaskan Earthquake''', began at 5:36 P.M. AST on Friday, March 27, 1964.<ref name="usgs" /> Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing buildings, and [[tsunami]]s directly caused about 131 deaths. This Alaskan [[megathrust earthquake]] is more commonly known as ''' The Good Friday Earthquake''' due to its occurrence on [[Good Friday]] of that year.

Lasting nearly five minutes, it was the most powerful recorded [[earthquake]] in [[United States|U.S.]] and [[North America]]n history, and the [[Lists of earthquakes#Largest earthquakes by magnitude|second most powerful]] ever measured by [[seismograph]].<ref name="usgs_largest">{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/10_largest_world.php|title=Largest Earthquakes in the World Since 1900|date=14 May 2009|work=Earthquake Hazards Program|publisher=US Geological Survey|accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref> It had a magnitude of 9.2, at the time making it the second largest earthquake in the recorded history of the world.<ref name="usgs">[http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1964_03_28.php US Geological Survey report on the earthquake]</ref><ref name="NOAA1">[http://wcatwc.arh.noaa.gov/64quake.htm The Great Alaskan Earthquake & Tsunamis of 1964], by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The powerful earthquake produced [[earthquake liquefaction]] in the region. Ground fissures and failures caused major structural damage in several communities, much damage to property and several landslides.  Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many [[Earthquake engineering|inadequately engineered]] houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm.  Two hundred miles southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by {{convert|30|ft|m}}. Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near [[Girdwood]] and Portage dropped as much as {{convert|8|ft|m}}, requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high [[tide]] mark.

In Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 30 people between the collapse of the [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time.  Nearby, a {{convert|27|ft|m|sing=on}} [[tsunami]] destroyed the village of [[Chenega, Alaska|Chenega]], killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Oregon, and California. Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan.  Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was reported from all over the earth.

==The earthquake==
At 5:36 p.m. [[Alaska Standard Time]] (3:36 a.m. March 28, 1964 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), a [[Fault (geology)|fault]] between the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[Tectonic plate|plates]] ruptured near [[College Fjord]] in Prince William Sound. The [[epicenter]] of the earthquake was {{Coord|61.05|N|147.48|W|}}, 12.4&nbsp;mi (20&nbsp;km) north of [[Prince William Sound]], 78 miles (125&nbsp;km) east of [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) west of [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]]. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5&nbsp;mi (25&nbsp;km). Ocean floor shifts created large [[tsunami]]s (up to 70 feet (20 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage. Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. [[Vertical displacement]] of up to 38 feet (11.5 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 miles<U+00B2> (250,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) within [[Alaska]].

==Type of fault==
The Alaska Earthquake was a [[subduction zone]] earthquake ([[megathrust earthquake]]), caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate.  It was a reverse fault caused by a compressional force.  This caused much of the uneven ground.

Various sources indicate that about 131 people died as a result of the earthquake: nine during the earthquake itself, 106 from subsequent tsunamis in [[Alaska]]<ref name="NOAA1" /> and 16 from tsunamis in [[Oregon]] and [[California]]. Property damage was estimated at over $310 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|300000000|1964|r=1}}}} in current U.S. dollars).

===Anchorage area===
Most damage occurred in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], 75&nbsp;mi (120&nbsp;km) northwest of the [[epicenter]]. Nine people were killed, the only deaths directly attributed to the earthquake. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but [[downtown]] Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying "Bootlegger Cove [[clay]]" near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered [[landslide]] damage. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged.  The 60-foot concrete control tower at [[Anchorage International Airport]] was not engineered to withstand earthquake activity and collapsed, killing one employee.<ref>Sozen, Mete A. and N. Norby Nielsen, 1973: ''Analysis of the failure of the Anchorage International Airport control tower''.  The great Alaska earthquake of 1964, Volume 3, Part 2, National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on the Alaska Earthquake, National Academy of Sciences, ISBN 0-309-01606-1.</ref>

The hamlets of [[Girdwood, Alaska|Girdwood]] and [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]], located 30 and 40&nbsp;mi (60&nbsp;km) southeast of central Anchorage on the [[Turnagain Arm]], were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About {{convert|20|mi|km}} of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised<!--really raised, or just rebuilt on higher ground?--> and rebuilt in 1964-66.

===Elsewhere in Alaska===
Most coastal towns in the [[Prince William Sound]], [[Kenai Peninsula]], and [[Kodiak Island]] areas, especially the major ports of [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]], [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]] were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused [[fire]]s. [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground 7&nbsp;km (4&nbsp;mi) west of its original site. Some [[Alaska Native]] villages, including [[Chenega, Alaska|Chenega]] and [[Afognak, Alaska|Afognak]], were destroyed or damaged.  The earthquake caused the Cold-War era ballistic missile detection radar of [[Clear Air Force Station]] to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history.  Near Cordova, the [[Miles Glacier Bridge|Million Dollar Bridge]] crossing the Copper River also collapsed. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Interestingly, only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face, now covered by countless thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Canada===
A 4.5&nbsp;ft (1.4 m) wave reached [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]], just south of the [[Alaska Panhandle]], about three hours after the quake. The tsunami then reached [[Tofino, British Columbia|Tofino]], on the exposed west coast of [[Vancouver Island]], and traveled up a [[fjord]] to hit [[Port Alberni, British Columbia|Port Alberni]] twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of [[Hot Springs Cove, British Columbia|Hot Springs Cove]], [[Zeballos, British Columbia|Zeballos]], and [[Amai, British Columbia|Amai]] also saw damage. The damage in British Columbia was estimated at $10 million Canadian ($65 million in 2006 Canadian dollars, or $56 million in 2006 U.S. dollars).

===Elsewhere===
Twelve people were killed by the tsunami in [[Crescent City, California]], while four children were killed on the Oregon coast at [[Beverly Beach State Park]].<ref>Oregon<U+2019>s pioneer spirit. [[Statesman Journal]], December 26, 1999.</ref> Other towns along the U.S. [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Hawaii]] were damaged. Minor damage to boats reached as far south as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

As the entire planet vibrated as a result of the quake, minor effects were felt worldwide.  Several fishing boats were sunk in [[Louisiana]], and water sloshed in wells in [[Africa]].<ref>[http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=106 USGS Release: 40th Anniversary of "Good Friday" Earthquake Offers New Opportunities for Public and Building Safety Partnerships (3/26/2004)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Aftershocks==
Over 10,000 aftershocks were recorded following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more occurred over the next three weeks. It was not until eighteen months later that the aftershocks were no longer noticed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
