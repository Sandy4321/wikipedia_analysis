"'''Diamonds'''" is a song recorded by Barbadian singer [[Rihanna]] for her seventh studio album, ''[[Unapologetic]]'' (2012). It was written by [[Sia Furler]] together with its producers, [[Benny Blanco]] and [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]]. The song premiered on September 26, 2012, during the ''[[Elvis Duran and the Morning Show]]'' and was [[music download|digitally]] released the following day as the [[lead single]] from ''Unapologetic''. [[Def Jam Recordings]] serviced the single to [[contemporary hit radio]] in the United States on October 2, 2012. "Diamonds" is a mid-tempo [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Pop music|pop]] ballad performed with heavy [[synthesizer]]s, orchestral sounds, and electronic rhythms. The song's lyrics serve as a departure from the themes of unhealthy relationships that were on Rihanna's previous singles.

"Diamonds" was well received by most critics, some of whom complimented Rihanna's different musical direction, while others criticized the song's production. The single topped music charts in over twenty countries, including the United States, where it became Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most number-one singles|tied her]] with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[The Supremes]] for the fifth-most number one singles in the chart's history. "Diamonds" was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). By May 2013, it had sold over 7.5 million copies worldwide, becoming [[List of best-selling singles|one of the best-selling singles of all-time]].

The song's [[music video]] was shot by director [[Anthony Mandler]], a frequent collaborator of Rihanna's, and depicts her in four environments that represent the elements of earth, air, water and fire. The video received positive reviews and was praised for its imagery. Some critics believe that the heavily tattooed man intertwined with Rihanna's arm in the video resembles [[Chris Brown (American entertainer)|Chris Brown]]. The singer performed "Diamonds" on television shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' and included it on the [[777 Tour]] and the [[Diamonds World Tour]] [[set list]]s. The [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2013. The official remix of "Diamonds" featured rapper [[Kanye West]] and was released on November 16, 2012. The song has been covered by various recording artists, including [[Leona Lewis]] and [[Misha B]].

After the song was completed, they wanted to play it to Rihanna, but Blanco was skeptical about the reaction towards the song because of its slow sound.

As the video progresses Rihanna is shown running on a highway. In a [[black-and-white]] scene, Rihanna licks the joint and begins smoking it. The image fades to black as the song begins. Rihanna performs in the same black-and-white setting while in a black corset. Images of Rihanna on a bed in a room while singing are shown, with objects breaking, curtains falling and roses burning in [[Backwards masking|reverse effect]]. Rihanna is shown again on the highway, running away from what appears to be the headlights of a chasing car. She then stops as she looks up to the night sky at an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] view. Throughout the video, Rihanna's hand is shown intertwined with that of a heavily tattooed man, whose face is not shown in the video. As the second verse starts, Rihanna is shown in a desert where horses run freely. Scenes of a street battle are later shown, depicting burning cars and broken glass around the environment. As the video continues, the singer and her lover's hands are shown slowly slipping apart, with only their fingertips touching towards the conclusion of the video. The video ends with Rihanna once again floating alone in the open waters.

===Reception===

Upon its release, the video received positive response from critics. James Montgomery of MTV News called it visually striking and observed a great deal of "evocative imagery (glamorous black-and-white close-ups, thick plumes of translucent smoke, oversaturated hill-scapes, artfully silhouetted stallions)".
