The '''Jews' Gate Cemetery''' is located on Windmill Hill in the southern portion of the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. Also known as the '''Windmill Hill Cemetery''', it is the site of the earliest known [[Jewish]] burials in Gibraltar. The cemetery opened by 1746 and closed in 1848. It is the burial site of a number of Gibraltar's [[Chief Rabbis]]. The graveyard is listed with the [[Gibraltar Heritage Trust]].

==History==

The Jews' Gate Cemetery, also known as the Windmill Hill Cemetery, is located on Windmill Hill near the entrance to the [[Upper Rock Nature Reserve]] in the southern portion of Gibraltar, the British overseas territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Crown Dependencies & Overseas Territories|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/publications-and-documents/treaties/uk-overseas-territories/list-crown-dependencies-overseas|work=fco.gov.uk|publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Virtual Jewish History Tour - Notable Jewish Sites|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Gibraltar.html|work=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library, A Project of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=hassid/> It is positioned on

The reasoning behind that choice of location for burials of members of the Jewish community is uncertain. One theory is that the cemetery utilised by Christians, near the border with Spain, was more subject to the laws regarding expulsion of Jews. The best-preserved gravestones at Jews' Gate Cemetery are those that, until recently, were protected by a layer of mud and peat. The inscriptions on the tombstones that have been exposed to the elements have become difficult to decipher. During half of the year, the winter and spring, plants are allowed to grow freely in the cemetery, in deference to the [[Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society]]. The area is a favoured mating and nesting ground of the [[Barbary Partridge]]; after their nesting season, the cemetery is cleared and the impression of neglect is removed.<ref name=hassid>{{cite web|title=The Windmill Hill (Jews<U+2019> Gate) Cemetery|url=http://www.jewishgibraltar.com/interest.php|work=jewishgibraltar.com|publisher=Gibraltar Jewish Community|author=Rabbi Roni Hassid|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> 

==Burials==

Within the center of the cemetery is a stone wall 1.5 metres in height which encloses the burial sites of ten to twelve of Gibraltar's Judges of Religious Law.<ref name=gate>{{cite web|title=Jews' Gate Cemetery|url=http://www.iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org/gibraltar/jews-gate.html|work=iajgsjewishcemeteryproject.org|publisher=International Jewish Cemetery Project, International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> The oldest tomb of the Tsadikim (Righteous people) within the enclosure, at the far left, is that of Chief Rabbi [[Solomon Abudarham]]. He succeeded Rabbi Yehuda ben Yitshak Halevi as Gibraltar's Chief Rabbi. Abudarham inaugurated the [[Synagogues of Gibraltar#The Flemish Synagogue|Flemish Synagogue]] on [[Line Wall Road, Gibraltar|Line Wall Road]] at the turn of the nineteenth century, laying the stone which still bears his name.<ref name=hassid/> He also established a school of religious study in [[Parliament Lane, Gibraltar|Parliament Lane]].<ref name=rock/> Abudarham died in 1804, the victim of a [[yellow fever]] epidemic. In 1820, the Academy of Rabbi Solomon Abudarham on Parliament Lane was converted into the [[Synagogues of Gibraltar#The Abudarham Synagogue|Abudarham Synagogue]].<ref name=rock>{{cite journal|journal=Rock Talk|date=July 2009|issue=2|url=http://friendsofgibraltar.org.uk/docs/1279458404Rock%20Talk%202.pdf|title=The Synagogues of Gibraltar|accessdate=7 September 2012|author=Tito Benady|page=14-15}}</ref><ref name=syn>{{cite web|title=Synagogues|url=http://www.jewishgibraltar.com/synagogues.php|work=jewishgibraltar.com|publisher=Gibraltar Jewish Community|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> The inscription on his gravestone reads:<ref name=hassid/>

{{Bquote|Tomb of the crown of our head, the sage versed in every area of the Torah, famed Dayan (judge), Light of the West, the eminent rabbi from distinguished family, honourable teacher and rabbi Shelomo Abudarham of blessed memory, called to the Heavenly court 4th Heshvan 5565 (December 1804).}}

The second oldest tombstone is the third from the left. The grave is that of Rabbi Raphael Moshe Hassan, who died in 1810. His inscription is also legible and reads:<ref name=hassid/>

{{Bquote|Tomb of our master, teacher and rabbi, a sage complete in his knowledge of all areas of Tora, Dayan and teacher, pious and humble, his honour our teacher and rabbi Raphael Moshe Hassan, of blessed memory, called to the Heavenly Court <U+2026>5th Adar 1 year 5570 from the creation (1810).}} 

The fifth tomb from the left in the enclosure is that of Rabbi Avraham Haim Burgel, the son of Rabbi Nathan Burgel, author of ''Hok Natan''. The younger Burgel died in 1813. His epitaph is:<ref name=hassid/>

{{Bquote|The tomb of the sage versed in all areas of the Tora, our honourable teacher and rabbi Abraham Hayim Burgel, son of that Tsadik the rabbi <U+201C>Hok Natan<U+201D> of blessed memory, and his repose was on Wednesday 22nd Elul 5573 (1813).}}

Rabbi Yeshaya Anahory also died in 1813, shortly after Rabbi Burgel. His tomb is within the far right of the walled enclosure. His inscription has been transcribed as:<ref name=hassid/>

{{Bquote|This is the tomb of the sage in all areas of Tora, the famed judge, the pious and humble honourable teacher and Rabbi Yeshaya Anahory of blessed memory, and his repose was in honour on 6th Tishri 5574 (1813).}}

The gravestone second from the left is that of Rabbi Yosef Elmalech ben Ayush. He first served as a rabbi in [[Morocco]] in 1788, and later accepted the position of [[Dayan]] (rabbinical judge) in Gibraltar, and remained there until his death in 1823. The fourth gravestone from the left is that of Rabbi Avraham Yisrael who died in 1844.<ref name=hassid/>

In the southern portion of the cemetery is a smaller enclosure with just a single grave, that of Rabbi Yisrael ben Yeshaya who died in 1841. After his death, the position of Chief Rabbi in Gibraltar remained open for four decades. Adjacent to the wall surrounding the rabbi's tomb, is that of Rabbi Yitshak Halevi III. He died in 1847, the year before the cemetery's closing. By then, there was little remaining space in the graveyard, which would make sense of the south-north orientation of his tomb, compared to the east-west alignment of other graves.<ref name=hassid/> Another grave within Jews' Gate Cemetery is that of Rev. R.H.M. Benaim.<ref name=gate/>

==Gibraltar Heritage Trust==

In 1989, the Gibraltar Heritage Trust designated the Jews' Gate Cemetery on Windmill Hill as a Category A Listed Building on Schedule 1, as noted in the Gibraltar Heritage Trust Act.<ref name=ght/>
