'''Runnymede''' is a [[water-meadow]] alongside the [[River Thames]] in the county of [[Surrey]], [[England]], associated with the signing of the [[Magna Carta]] and today the site of a collection of memorials.

== History ==
[[Image:Runnymede-windsor-entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance from [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] with road passing between Lutyens designed lodges.]]
The water-meadow at Runnymede is the most likely location at which, in 1215, [[John of England|King John]] sealed the Magna Carta, and the charter itself indicates Runnymede by name. 

It has been disputed whether the ceremony took place actually in the meadow, or on [[Magna Carta Island]], a small (and now private) island in the Thames adjacent to the meadow, or at [[Ankerwycke]], an ancient place adjoining Magna Carta Island on the far bank. Although the latter two locations are now in [[Berkshire]], they may have been considered part of Runnymede at the time.

Twenty miles southwest of [[London]], Runnymede Meadow, with adjoining lands totalling 182 acres, was presented to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] by the first [[Lady Fairhaven]] and her two sons in memory of [[Urban Hanlon Broughton]] in 1929.  The memorial to Broughton consists of the kiosks, piers and lodges ('The Fairhaven Lodges') at the Windsor end designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]].

== Description ==
Runnymede is an attractive riverside meadow and adjoining woodland, albeit somewhat disturbed by a busy road. Because of its historical connections, Runnymede is the site of several memorials. These are all located amongst the trees of Coopers Hill, which backs the water-meadow.[[Image:Air Forces Memorial Runnymede.jpg|thumb|right|Commonwealth Air Forces Memorial.]]
====Air Forces Memorial====
The [[Air Forces Memorial]] commemorates the men and women of the Allied Air Forces who died during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and records the names of the 20,456 airmen who have no known grave. 

From the top of the tower visitors can see long views over [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], the surrounding counties and, somehow appropriately, aircraft taking off and landing at [[Heathrow airport|Heathrow]]. The memorial was designed by [[Edward Maufe]], architect of [[Guildford Cathedral]].

====John F. Kennedy Memorial====
[[Image:Runnymede-jfk.jpg|thumb|right|JFK Memorial designed by Geoffrey Jellico]] The British memorial to the assassinated [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]] was jointly dedicated in May, 1965, by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], prior to a reception for the [[Kennedy family]] at [[Windsor Castle]]. The memorial consists of a [[Portland stone]] memorial tablet inscribed with the famous quote from his Inaugural Address: 

{{cquote|Let every Nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty.}}

Visitors reach the memorial by treading a steep path of irregular granite steps, intended to symbolise a pilgrimage. The area of ground that the memorial is situated on was given as a gift to the [[United States of America]] by the People of Britain, and as such it is [[United States territory|American territory]]. (It is an extraterritorial site in roughly the same sort of way that an embassy is considered to be.  A similar situation exists in [[Hawaii]], where the spot on which [[James Cook]] died has been given to Britain.) It is maintained by the [[Kennedy Memorial Trust]], which also sponsors educational scholarships for British students to attend university in the United States.

====Magna Carta Memorial====
Built by the [[American Bar Association]], this memorial is of a domed classical style, containing a pillar of English granite on which is inscribed "To commemorate Magna Carta, symbol of Freedom Under Law".

====Cooper's Hill House====
A large house on Cooper's Hill, overlooking Runnymede and the [[River Thames]], has played a number of roles &ndash; as the [[Royal Indian Engineering College]], wartime [[Post Office]] headquarters, storage for the Statue of [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] during [[World War II]], an emergency teacher training college, [[Shoreditch]] College &ndash; a centre for craft and handiwork education, and most recently, [[Brunel University]]'s design school(has removed to Uxbridge Main Campus).

== Access ==
Runnymede is owned by the National Trust and is open during daylight hours, seven days a week, at no charge.

== Location ==
Runnymede is located on the banks of the River Thames, and on the [[A308 road]] in [[Egham]] about 4 miles east of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. It is about 19 miles west of the centre of [[London]]. Its historical significance has been heavily influenced by its proximity to the [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman Road]] [[Crossings of the River Thames|river crossing]] at nearby [[Staines]]. The last fatal duel in England took place on [[Priest Hill]], which borders with Runnymede, in 1852.
