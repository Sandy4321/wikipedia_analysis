'''Buckland Rings''' is the site of an [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[Hillforts in Britain|hill fort]] in the town of [[Lymington|Lymington, Hampshire]]. Today, the mounds and dykes around the outside which once constituted its defences are still clearly visible, although the outer bank lies under the road on the west side, and on the south-east it is nearly ploughed-out. Excavations of the inner and middle ramparts in 1935 revealed that they were of wall-and-fill construction, retained at the front by upright timber beams and walls of cut and laid turf. The entrance, which lies on the east side, was also excavated revealing a long entrance passage and the [[posthole]]s for a pair of stout [[gatepost]]s. The site was bought by [[Hampshire County Council]] in 1989 to ensure its preservation, and it is open to the public from the [[A337 road]] onto which part of it faces.

==Overview==
Buckland Rings is a triple-banked, rectangular encampment dating from the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]]. Although this type of enclosure is commonly referred to as a [[Hillforts in Britain|hillfort]], Buckland Rings is in fact only 27 metres above sea-level.<ref name="dyer237">{{Harvnb|Dyer|2001|p=237}}</ref> This type of site is rare in lowland areas and as such it is the best preserved and most important in the [[Hampshire Basin|Hampshire/Dorset basin]].<ref name="nfdc">{{Harvnb|New Forest District Council|2008}}</ref> It stands on a spur of gravel and encloses 2.8 [[hectare]]s.<ref name="dyer237"/> The innermost bank stands 2.4 metres high whilst the middle one is lower but unusually wide.<ref name="dyer237"/> Buckland Rings has well preserved triple banks and double ditches,<ref name="nfdc"/> although the outer bank lies under the road on the west side,<ref name="dyer237"/> and the east side which contained the entrance was partly ploughed up in the mid 18th century.<ref name="nfdc"/>

==Early reports==
[[File:Buckland Rings by Thomas Wright 1744.png|thumb|right|Buckland Rings depicted by Thomas Wright in 1744]]
The earliest report of Buckland Rings was by Thomas Wright who visited the site in the summer of 1743.<ref name="wright1744">{{Harvnb|Wright|1744}}</ref> He described Buckland Rings as "very strong, with double ditches, and triple [[Vallum]]s, upon the Top of {{not a typo|an}} Hill, three Ways guarded by a natural Ascent." Wright drew a plan of the fort, which is especially valuable as some of the eastern ramparts were flattened by a farmer around 1750.<ref name="closebrooks1">{{Harvnb|Close-Brooks|2000|p=1}}</ref> Wright also noticed the presence of a lower camp nearby (Ampress Camp) together with a farm called Ampress Farm, which he understood to be "Ambrose Farm", and he thought that it was "not improbable" that the site was "a principal station" belonging to the 5th century Romano-British war-leader [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]].<ref name="wright1744"/>

This thought was elaborated on by [[Richard Warner (antiquary)|Richard Warner]] in 1793 who fancifully described how Ambrosius "unable to support the furious attacks of the invaders, was probably driven, ... till he reached the neighbourhood of Lymington."<ref name="warner">{{Harvnb|Warner|1793|p=78}}</ref> Warner describes how "an earthwork, a rude sample of British [[castra]]metation, may still be discerned at this place."<ref name="warner"/>

Others simply thought that Buckland Rings was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] camp,<ref>eg. {{Harvnb|Lewis|1831}}</ref> but in 1887 the newly-formed ''Hampshire Field Club and Archaeological Society'' examined the site and resolved that the word "Roman" should be omitted from future [[Ordnance Survey]] maps.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hampshire Field Club and Archaeological Society|1887}}</ref>

==1935 Excavations==
To date the only excavation of the site was that conducted over a three week period in 1935 under the supervision of [[Christopher Hawkes]], following some preparatory work in 1934.<ref name="closebrooks2">{{Harvnb|Close-Brooks|2000|p=2}}</ref> Hawkes limited his excavations to areas around the entrance, and especially to the inner and middle [[Defensive wall|ramparts]] and ditches on the east side where the ramparts had been almost totally removed around 1750.<ref name="avery53">{{Harvnb|Avery|1993|p=53}}</ref>

===Inner ditch and rampart===
The inner ditch was of V-section, 3.5 metres deep and 8.8 metres wide. [[Posthole]]s for upright beams were found at the front of the inner rampart.<ref name="avery53"/> These posts would have held horizontal timbers forming a wooden [[revetment]] to the front of the rampart.<ref name="closebrooks2"/> The rampart was composed of sand and gravel dug from the ditches,<ref name="closebrooks2"/> together with a wall of cut and laid [[Sod|turf]] into which the posts had been recessed.<ref name="avery53"/> Additional postholes were discovered 5.8 metres behind the front postholes. These presumably held anchor timbers for the front wall,<ref name="avery53"/> although the 5.8 metre distance between the rows is thought somewhat excessive for simple cross-bracing.<ref name="cunliffe353">{{Harvnb|Cunliffe|2005|p=353}}</ref>

[[File:Ditch in the northern ramparts of Buckland Rings - geograph.org.uk - 255990.jpg|thumb|right|Inner ditch in the northern ramparts of Buckland Rings]]
===Middle rampart===
The middle rampart was apparently rather lower than the inner rampart, since the middle ditch was rather smaller than the inner ditch.<ref name="avery53"/> Only one posthole was found, but it is thought that this rampart also had a wall-and-fill structure with upright beams and a facing wall of cut and laid turf.<ref name="avery53"/>

===Entrance===
The entrance was a narrow passage extending some 60 metres in length from the outer edge of the second ditch to gates at the inmost end.<ref name="avery53"/> The width of the passage varied between 8 to 12 metres along most of its length before narrowing to some 3 to 3.5 metres at the gates.<ref name="avery53"/> The gates were supported on timbers in two massive holes, 90 centimetres in diameter.<ref name="avery54">{{Harvnb|Avery|1993|p=54}}</ref>

===Evaluation===
The finds from the excavation were very few, and of limited help in dating the site. A small iron chain was found, consisting of a circular ring and remains of five oval links.<ref name="avery54"/> There were also a few scraps of Iron-Age pottery, and a fragment of a bronze tube believed to be a "horn-cap," a type of object which it is believed was mounted on the ends of [[chariot]] [[yoke]]s.<ref name="closebrooks3">{{Harvnb|Close-Brooks|2000|p=3}}</ref> Hawkes himself believed that the fort was built in the first century BC and was demolished in about 43 AD, possibly by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].<ref name="closebrooks2"/> Advances in Iron-Age archaeology since the 1930's have now led modern archaeologists to adopt a longer chronology for the site.<ref name="closebrooks2"/> The site may date from the Early to Middle Iron-Age (c. 5th century BC)<ref name="closebrooks3"/> and may have started out with a single bank and ditch system.<ref name="nfdc"/> Later the ramparts may have been refurbished,<ref name="avery53"/> and the outer ramparts were added to the original construction.<ref name="cunliffe357">{{Harvnb|Cunliffe|2005|p=357}}</ref> Many hillforts in southern England had been abandoned well before the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]], and Buckland Rings may have fallen out use by the 1st century BC.<ref name="closebrooks3"/> The finds from excavation are stored in [[Winchester]].<ref name="dyer237"/>

==1993 survey==
A [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical survey]] was conducted in the interior of Buckland Rings in 1993 using [[Magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetometry]].<ref name="payne">{{Harvnb|Payne|1993}}</ref> However, geological conditions at the site for magnetic detection of archaeology were discovered to be poor and features such as posthole structures were undetectable.<ref name="payne"/> The survey was able to trace the course of the missing defences, locate the position of Hawkes's excavations, and partially define the entrance features. Evidence of settlement activity, however, was inconclusive.<ref name="payne"/>

==The site today==
Today the site is well-preserved, and the only obvious damage is where parts of the eastern ramparts were flattened in the 18th century, and where the outer rampart on the western side has been encroached upon by the road.<ref name="nfdc"/> In addition, two houses were built inside the west end of the fort in the early twentieth century.<ref name="nfdc"/> In 1986, a [[property developer]] announced plans to build a [[leisure centre]] inside Buckland Rings.<ref name="closebrooks7">{{Harvnb|Close-Brooks|2000|p=7}}</ref> These plans were rejected in a [[public inquiry]] in 1988.<ref name="closebrooks7"/> Since 1989 Buckland Rings has been in the care and ownership of [[Hampshire County Council]] and it is now open to visitors on foot.<ref name="nfdc"/> Buckland Rings is now a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].<ref name="nfdc"/> There is also a [[mountain bike]] trail adjacent to Buckland rings situated in a disused [[gravel pit]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Buckland Rings Trail - Mountain Biking |url = http://www.moredirt.co.uk/trail/South-East--London/Buckland-Rings-Trail/202/ |accessdate = 7 March 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Ampress Camp by Thomas Wright 1744.png|thumb|right|Ampress Camp as depicted by Thomas Wright in 1744. North is to the right]]
==Ampress Camp==
Close to Buckland Rings is another earthwork enclosure known as Ampress Camp (or Ampress Hole). It lies 360 metres east of Buckland Rings alongside [[Lymington River]].<ref name="dyer154">{{Harvnb|Dyer|1981|p=154}}</ref> It had been noted by Thomas Wright in 1744, who described it as "upon a lower Ground, close by a River (which defends it on one Side), with a Ditch and Vallum half round, and a kind of [[Marsh|Morass]] on the other."<ref name="wright1744"/> The outer rampart depicted by Wright has long since been flattened, and the ditches have been filled in.<ref name="closebrooks4">{{Harvnb|Close-Brooks|2000|p=4}}</ref> Much of the interior still survives, although [[waterworks]] occupy some of the site.<ref name="closebrooks4"/> There have been only limited excavations, but a few scraps of pottery found at the site may date from the Iron-Age.<ref name="closebrooks7"/> If the camp does date from the Iron Age, then it is unusual to have two Iron Age camps so close together,<ref name="closebrooks7"/> and Ampress Camp may perhaps have formed a beachhead for the inhabitants of Buckland Rings.<ref name="dyer154"/>
