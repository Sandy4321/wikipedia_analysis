'''''Blood Inside''''' is the sixth full-length album by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] experimental band [[Ulver]]. It was recorded in early 2004. A video for "It Is Not Sound" was filmed by Acoustic Kung Fu Films! in mid-2004 (viewable [http://www.akff.no/ here]), which pushed the album's release to 2005.<ref name="liner"/>

==Sound and style==
Ulver's sound progresses here even more than in previous records. The music is influenced by several different genres such as [[rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[classical music]], [[industrial music]], and [[electronica]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Zachariadis  | first = Stefanos | title = Ulver - Blood Inside | publisher = Metal Invader | date = 2005-05-03 | url = http://www.metal-invader.com/db/reviews-1914.html | accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref>

"It Is Not Sound" is heavily based on [[Toccata and Fugue in D Minor]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. The prominent melody played with keyboards can easily be found in Bach's work, but there are other extracts in the background also.

The lyrics for "Christmas" were adapted from the poem of the same name by Portuguese author [[Fernando Pessoa]], written in 1922.
