==Professional wrestling career==
El Cobarde was one of the first ''luchadors'' to travel and perform in [[Japan]] where he would compete in a number of matches, including unsuccessfully challenging for the the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. He lost his mask in a ''[[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Luchas de Apuestas]]'' ("Bet match") against his lifelong friend [[Fishman|Fishman (wrestler)]] who he had originally trained at the start of Fishman's career.<ref name=EncilopediaCobarde/> After the loss of his mask he remained with [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre]] (EMLL), turning from ''[[Heel (professional wrestling)|rudo]]'' (people who portray the bad guy characters in wrestling) to a ''[[Face (professional wrestling)|tecnico]]'' ("Good guy")  and receiving standing ovations from crowds across Mexico, but especially in [[Juarez]], having become a "national idol".

==Death and Legacy==
After losing his mask, Delgado struggled to stay in a prominent position, he eventually left the scene after learning he had [[Leukemia]]. He died on February 7 1983, from the disease

After his death his brother Francisco (who had wrestled as El Impostor up until this point) took over the ''El Cobarde'' ring persona and mask, becoming "El Cobarde II". The Cobarde II character spawned two different wrestlers working under the ring name "El Cobarde, Jr.", one the brother of El Cobarde (I and II) while the the other was the son of El Cobarde II, another son wrestled under the names Hijo del Cobarde ("Son of El Cobarde").<ref name="MondoFamily"/>
