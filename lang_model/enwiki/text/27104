The '''Michigan Avenue Bridge''' is a [[bascule bridge]] that carries [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] across the main stem of the [[Chicago River]] in downtown [[Chicago]], Illinois, United States. The bridge was planned in the early 20th century as part of a scheme to link Chicago's south side and north side parks with a grand boulevard. Construction of the bridge started in 1918, it opened to traffic in 1920, and work on the decoration of the bridge was completed in 1928. The bridge provides passage for vehicles and pedestrians on two levels, it is an example of a fixed [[trunnion]] bascule bridge, which later became widely known as a "Chicago style bascule". It is included in the [[Michigan<U+2013>Wacker Historic District]] and has been designated as a [[Chicago Landmark]].

The location of the Michigan Avenue Bridge is significant to the early history of Chicago, and events in the history of the city are commemorated Chicago history with sculptures and plaques on the bridge. The bridge also houses the McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum in one of the bridge tender houses.

==Location==
[[File:Michigan Avenue Bridge 20080811.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the bridge, looking south along [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]]]]
The Michigan Avenue Bridge has a north<U+2013>south orientation, spanning the main stem of the Chicago River between the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] and [[Loop, Chicago|Loop]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community areas]] of Chicago.<ref>{{cite map |publisher=Google Inc |title=Google Maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.888861,-87.624361(Michigan+Avenue+Bridge)&ie=UTF8&ll=41.88886,-87.624357&spn=0.003582,0.005901&z=18  |accessdate=October 10, 2010}}</ref> Its northern portal lies at the foot of the [[Magnificent Mile]], between the [[Wrigley Building]] and [[Tribune Tower]]. Its southern portal is at the intersection of Michigan Avenue and [[Wacker Drive]], overlooked by the [[London Guarantee Building]] and [[333 North Michigan]]. The neighboring bridges are [[Columbus Drive Bridge]] to the east and [[Wabash Avenue Bridge]] to the west.

The bridge is situated in a historically significant area.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stamper|first=John W.|title=North Michigan Avenue: a building book from the Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|publisher=Pomegranate|isbn=0764933825|page=8}}</ref> The northern end of the bridge covers part of the [[Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite]], the place where [[Jean Baptiste Point du Sable]], Chicago's first permanent resident, built his home in the 1780s.{{#tag:ref|According to an 1892 description of the location of the house, it "stood as nearly as may be at the foot of Pine Street <nowiki>[</nowiki>now Michigan Avenue<nowiki>]</nowiki>, partly upon the ground now occupied by Kirk's factory, and partly in what is now known as North Water Street, properly an extension of Kinzie Street."

==History==
[[File:Plan of Chicago Plate CXII.jpg|thumb|right|Michigan Boulevard and bridge as proposed in Burnham & Bennett's [[1909 Plan of Chicago]]]]
A boulevard to link the parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891.<ref name="Tribune19200514" /> An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river.<ref>{{cite news|title=Great Boulevard Subway Project for Connecting North and South Divisions of the City|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 22, 1903|page=3}}</ref> In 1903 an editorial in the Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Michigan Avenue Dream|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 31, 1903|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Experts Praise Boulevard Plan|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 21, 1903|page=8}}</ref> Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the [[Pont Alexandre III]] that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double-decked.<ref>{{cite news|title=Many Plans are Submitted for the Boulevard Link|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 11, 1904|page=4}}</ref> 

Plans for the boulevard and the construction of a Michigan Avenue Bridge were further elaborated upon in [[Daniel Burnham]]'s [[1909 Plan of Chicago]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Burnham|Bennett|1909|pp=101<U+2013>107}}</ref> In 1911 a plan was selected that included the widening of Michigan Avenue from Randolph Street to the river, replacing the Rush Street bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue and the construction of a double-decked boulevard along Pine Street as far as Ohio Street.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wide Boulevard Scheme Chosen|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 11, 1911|page=3}}</ref> An ordinance to fund construction was passed in 1913, but was declared void by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite news|title=No Beginning on Boulevard Link for Three Years|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=May 6, 1915|page=13}}</ref> A second ordinance was passed in 1914, but legal battles continued until the end of 1916.<ref>{{cite news|title=Last Obstacle to Boulevard Link Removed|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=December 29, 1916|page=2}}</ref> Construction finally started on April 15, 1918, and the bridge was officially opened in a ceremony on May 14, 1920.<ref name="Tribune19200514" />

The bridge is one of the contributing properties of the [[Michigan<U+2013>Wacker Historic District]], which was listed as on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on November 15, 1978.<ref name="nrhpdoc">{{Cite document|title={{PDFlink|[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200181.pdf National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Michigan<U+2013>Wacker Historic District]|32&nbsp;KB}}|date=1978-02-03|accessdate=2008-07-07|author=Robert Wagner |publisher=National Park Service|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> It was also designated as a [[Chicago Landmark]] on October 2, 1991.<ref>{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Robert|title=City Makes Bridge a Landmark, Puts De Paul on State Street|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 3, 1991}}</ref> In 2009 the sidewalks and railings on the bridge were replaced, and the bridge was repainted; the design of the new ornamental railings was based on the original 1920 design for the bridge's railings, replacing more utilitarian ones that had been substituted at a later date.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kamin|first=Blair|title=Perfect timing for the Olympics inspection: Handsome new railings on the Michigan Avenue Bridge|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-04-05/news/0904030149_1_railings-michigan-avenue-bridge-east-side|accessdate=September 19, 2010|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=April 5, 2009}}</ref>

==Design and operation==
Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed [[counterweight]], trunnion bascule bridge.<ref name="HAER" /> It was engineered by the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering;<ref name="HAER" /> [[Edward H. Bennett]] was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy the chief engineer of construction.<ref>{{cite web|last=McMahon|first=James D.|title=Plaque Commemorating Opening of Michigan Avenue Bridge|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/10481.html|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|accessdate=September 25, 2010}}</ref> At the time of construction it was believed to be the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck.<ref name="Young 1920 p508" /> 
[[File:Michigan_Ave_Bridge_060415.jpg|thumb|left|The Michigan Avenue Bridge is raised twice weekly in the Spring and Autumn]]

Each of the bridge's leaves are divided into two along the axis of the bridge such that it functions as two parallel bridges that can be operated independently of one another; at the time of construction bridges in the Chicago River were frequently struck by vessels, and this duplex arrangement allows for leaves damaged in such a collision to be opened for repair without needing to completely close the bridge to traffic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1920|p=509}}</ref> The counterweights are below the level of the lower deck and when the bridge is opened they swing down into {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} deep reinforced concrete tailpits that descend {{convert|34.5|ft|m}} below the surface of the river.<ref name="Young and Mulcahey 1919">{{Harvnb|Young|Mulcahey|1919|p=210}}</ref> Each of the two tailpits is supported on 9 cylindrical foundation piers. One of these piers was sunk to [[bedrock]], {{convert|108|ft|m}} below the river surface, the other 17 piers are sunk to the [[hardpan]], which is {{convert|80|to|90|ft|m}} below the water level.<ref name="Young and Mulcahey 1919" /> On the south side of the river one of the freight tunnels of the [[Chicago Tunnel Company]] had to be re-routed to make room for the tailpit.<ref name="Young and Mulcahey 1919" /> The counterweights are composed partly of concrete and partly of a concrete composite with rivet punchings; each of the four counterweights weighs {{convert|1595|ST|MT}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1920|p=514}}</ref>

The outward-facing walls of the four bridgehouses each feature a sculpture depicting scenes from Chicago's history that were added to the bridge in 1928.

==McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum==
[[File:Bridgehouse Museum 20101009.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to the Bridgehouse Museum]]
The southwest bridgehouse has been converted into a museum. The McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum is a 5-floor, {{convert|1,613|sqft|m2|adj=on}} museum that opened on June 10, 2006; it is named for [[Robert R. McCormick]], formerly owner of the Chicago Tribune and president of the Chicago Sanitary District.<ref name="Tribune20060607" /> The Robert R. McCormick Foundation was the major donor that helped to provide the $950,000 cost of the formation of the museum.<ref name="Tribune20060607" /> It is run by the Friends of the Chicago River,<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Museum|url=http://bridgehousemuseum.org/about/the-museum/|work=McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum website|publisher=McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}</ref> and includes exhibits on the history of the Chicago River and the bridge. Visitors are also allowed to access the bridge's gear room; during the spring and fall bridge lifting visitors can see the bridge gears in operation as the leaves are raised and lowered.<ref name="Tribune20060607" /> Due to its small size and tight access stairway only 34 people are allowed inside the museum at any one time.<ref name="Tribune20060607" />
