The '''Raid on Deerfield''' (or the '''Deerfield Massacre'''<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 273<U+2013>274</ref>) occurred during [[Queen Anne's War]] on February 29, 1704, when [[France|French]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] forces under the command of [[Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville]] attacked the [[England|English]] settlement at [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]], just before dawn, burning part of the town and killing 56 villagers.

French organizers of the raid drew on a variety of Indian populations, including in the force of about 300 a number of [[Pocumtuc]]s who had once lived in the Deerfield area.  The diversity of personnel involved in the raid meant that it did not achieve full surprise when they entered the palisaded village.  The defenders of some fortified houses in the village successfully held off the raiders until arriving reinforcements prompted their retreat.  More than 100 captives were taken, and about 40 percent of the village houses were destroyed.

The raid has been immortalized as a part of the early American frontier story, principally due to the account of one of its captives, the Rev. [[John Williams (Reverend)|John Williams]].  He and his family were forced to make the long overland journey to [[Canada, New France|Canada]].  His young daughter [[Eunice Williams|Eunice]] was adopted by a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] family; she became assimilated and married a Mohawk man.  Williams' account, ''The Redeemed Captive'', was published in 1707 and was widely popular in the colonies.

==Background==
At the time of the arrival of European colonists in the middle reaches of the [[Connecticut River]] valley (where it presently flows through the state of [[Massachusetts]]), the area that is now [[Deerfield, Massachusetts]] was inhabited by the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] [[Pocomtuc]] nation.<ref>Melvoin, pp. 26<U+2013>29</ref>  In the early 1660s, the Pocumtuc were shattered as a nation due to conflict with the aggressive [[Mohawk nation]].<ref>Melvoin, pp. 39<U+2013>47</ref>  In 1665 villagers from the eastern Massachusetts town of [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] were given a grant in the area, and acquired land titles of uncertain legality from a variety of Pocumtuc individuals.  A village, at first called Pocumtuck, but later Deerfield, was established in the early 1670s.<ref>Melvoin, pp. 52<U+2013>58</ref>

===Deerfield===
By 1675 the village had grown to number about 200 individuals.  In that year, conflict between colonists and Indians in southern [[New England]] erupted into what is now known as [[King Philip's War]].<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 20</ref>  The war involved all of the New England colonies, and resulted in the destruction or severe reduction and pacification of most of its Indian nations as well as inflicting many casualties on the New England colonists.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Deerfield, which was in a relatively isolated position on the edge of English settlement, was evacuated in September 1675 after a coordinated series of attacks culminating in the [[Battle of Bloody Brook]] resulted in the death of about half the village's adult males.  The abandoned village, one of several in the Connecticut River valley abandoned by the English, was briefly reoccupied by the warring Indians.<ref>Melvoin, pp. 108,114</ref><ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 21</ref>  The colonists regrouped, and in 1676 a force of mostly local colonists [[Battle of Turner's Falls|slaughtered an Indian camp]] at a site then called ''Peskeompscut''.  It is now called [[Turner's Falls, Massachusetts|Turner's Falls]] after William Turner, the English leader who was slain in the action.<ref>Melvoin, p. 115</ref>

[[File:Tribal Territories Southern New England.png|thumb|left|This map depicts the approximate distribution of Indian tribes throughout southern New England in about 1600; later English colonial settlements, including Deerfield and locations of significance in [[King Philip's War]] are shown.]]
Ongoing raids by the Mohawk forced many of the remaining Indians to retreat north to French-controlled [[Canada, New France|Canada]] or to the west.<ref>Melvoin, p. 121</ref>  Those going west joined other tribes that had formed a peace of sorts with the authorities of the [[Province of New York]]. During [[King William's War]] (1688<U+2013>1697), Deerfield was not subjected to major attacks, but the community had 12 residents killed in a series of ambushes and other incidents.  Supposedly friendly Indians who were recognized as Pocumtuc were also seen passing through the area, and some of them claimed to have participated in attacks on other frontier communities.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 29<U+2013>30</ref>

Attacks on the frontier communities of what is now southern [[Maine]] at the start of [[Queen Anne's War]] in 1703 (see [[Raid on Wells]]) again put Deerfield residents on the alert. The town's [[palisade]], constructed during King William's War, was rehabilitated and expanded.<ref name=M213>Melvoin, p. 213</ref>  In August of that year, the local militia commander called out the militia after he received intelligence of "a party of French & Indians from Canada" who were "expected every hour to make some attaque on ye towns upon Connecticut River."<ref>Melvoin, p. 212</ref>  However, nothing happened until October, when two men were taken from a pasture outside the palisade.<ref name=M213/>  Militia were sent to guard the town in response, but these returned to their homes with the advent of winter, which was not thought to be a time for warfare.<ref name="M215"/>  

Minor raids against other communities convinced Governor [[Joseph Dudley]] to send 20 men to garrison Deerfield in February.  These men, minimally trained militia from other nearby communities, had arrived by the 24th, making for somewhat cramped accommodations within the town's palisade on the night of February 28.<ref name=HS98>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 98</ref><ref name=M215_6>Melvoin, pp. 215<U+2013>216</ref>  In addition to these men, the townspeople mustered about 70 men of fighting age; these forces were all under the command of Captain Jonathan Wells.<ref name=HS98/>

===Organizing the raid===
The Connecticut River valley had been identified as a potential raiding target by authorities in [[New France]] as early as 1702.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 38</ref>  The forces for the raid had begun gathering near [[Montreal]] as early as May 1703, as reported with reasonable accuracy in English intelligence reports.  However, two incidents intervened that delayed execution of the raid.  The first was a rumor that English warships were on the [[Saint Lawrence River]], drawing a significant Indian force to [[Quebec City|Quebec]] for its defense.  The second was the detachment of some troops, critically including [[Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville]], who was to lead the raid, for operations in Maine (including a raid against [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] that raised the frontier alarms at Deerfield).  Hertel de Rouville did not return to Montreal until the fall.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 99</ref>

[[File:Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville]]]]
The force assembled at [[Chambly, Quebec|Chambly]], just south of Montreal, numbered about 250, and was composed of a diversity of personnel.<ref name=HS100>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 100</ref>  There were 48 Frenchmen, some of them [[Canadien]] militia and others recruits from the [[troupes de la marine]], including four of Hertel de Rouville's brothers.<ref name=HS100/><ref name=C31>Calloway, p. 31</ref>  The French leadership included a number of men with more than 20 years experience in wilderness warfare.<ref name=HS100/> The Indian contingent included 200 [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]], [[Iroquois]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], and [[Pocumtuc]], some of whom sought revenge for incidents that had taken place years earlier.<ref name=HS100/><ref name=C31/>  These were joined by another 30 to forty [[Pennacook]] led by the sachem [[Wattanummon]] as the party moved south toward Deerfield in January and February 1704, raising the troop size to nearly 300 by the time it reached the Deerfield area in late February.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 111</ref><ref>Calloway, p. 47</ref>

The expedition's departure was not a very well kept secret.  In January 1704, New York's Indian agent [[Pieter Schuyler]] was warned by the Iroquois of possible action. which he forwarded on to Governor Dudley and Connecticut's Governor [[Fitz-John Winthrop|Winthrop]]; further warnings came to them in mid-February, although none were specific about the target.<ref>Haefeli andn Sweeney, pp. 110<U+2013>111</ref>

==Raid==
The raiders left most of their equipment and supplies 25 to 30 miles (40 to 48 kilometers) north of the village before establishing a cold camp about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from Deerfield on February 28, 1704.  From this vantage point, they observed the villagers as they prepared for the night.  Since the villagers had been alerted to the possibility of a raid, they all took refuge within the palisade, and a guard was posted.<ref>Melvoin, p. 216</ref>

The raiders had noticed that snow drifts extended to the top of the palisade; this greatly simplified their entry into the fortifications just before dawn on February 29.  They carefully approached the village, stopping periodically so that the sentry might confuse the noises they made with more natural sounds.  A few men climbed over the palisade via the snow drifts and then opened the north gate to admit the rest.  Primary sources vary on the degree of alertness of the village guard that night; one account claims he fell asleep, while another claims that he discharged his weapon to raise the alarm when the attack began, but that it was not heard by many people.<ref name=M217>Melvoin, p. 217</ref>  As the Reverend [[John Williams (Reverend)|John Williams]] later recounted, "with horrid shouting and yelling", the raiders launched their attack "like a flood upon us."<ref name=M217/>

The raiders' attack probably did not go exactly as they had intended.  In attacks on [[Schenectady massacre|Schenectady, New York]] and [[Raid on Oyster River|Durham, New Hampshire]] in the 1690s (both of which included Hertel de Rouville's father), the raiders had simultaneously attacked all of the houses; at Deerfield, this did not happen.  Historians Haefeli and Sweeney theorize that the failure to launch a coordinated assault was caused by the wide diversity within the attacking force.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 113</ref>

[[File:DeerfieldReturn1704.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Howard Pyle]] showing the journey back to Canada]]
The raiders swept into the village, and began attacking individual houses.  Reverend Williams' house was among the first to be raided; Williams' life was spared when his gunshot misfired, and he was taken prisoner.  Two of his children and a servant were slain; the rest of his family and his other servant were also taken prisoner.<ref>Melvoin, p. 218</ref> Similar scenarios occurred in many of the other houses.  The residents of Benoni Stebbins' house, which was not among the ones attacked early, resisted the raiders' attacks, which lasted until well after daylight.  A second house, near the northwestern corner of the palisade, was also successfully defended.  The raiders moved through the village, herding their prisoners to an area just north of the town, rifling houses for items of value, and setting a number of them on fire.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 115<U+2013>119</ref>

As the morning progressed, some of the raiders began moving north with their prisoners, but paused about a mile north of the town to wait for those who had not yet finished in the village.<ref name=M220/>  The men in the Stebbins house kept the battle up for two hours; they were on the verge of surrendering when reinforcements arrived.  Early in the raid, young John Sheldon managed to escape over the palisade and began making his way to nearby [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] to raise the alarm. The fires from the burning houses had been spotted, and "thirty men from Hadley and [[Hatfield, Massachusetts|Hatfield]]" rushed to Deerfield.<ref>Melvoin, p. 219</ref>  Their arrival prompted the remaining raiders to flee; some of them abandoned their weapons and other supplies in a panic.<ref name=M220>Melvoin, p. 220</ref>

The sudden departure of the raiders and the arrival of reinforcements raised the spirits of the beleaguered survivors, and about 20 Deerfield men joined the Hadley men in chasing after the fleeing raiders.  The English and the raiders skirmished in the meadows just north of the village, where the English reported "killing and wounding many of them".<ref name=M220/>  However, the pursuit was conducted rashly, and the English soon ran into an ambush prepared by the raiders who had left the village earlier.  Of the 50 or so men that gave chase, nine were killed and several more were wounded.<ref name=M220/>  After the ambush they retreated back to the village, and the raiders headed north with their prisoners.<ref name=M220/>

As the alarm spread to the south, reinforcements continued to arrive in the village.  By midnight, 80 men from [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] and [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]] had arrived, and men from Connecticut swelled the force to 250 by the end of the next day.  After debating over what action to take, they decided that the difficulties of pursuit were not worth the risks.  Leaving a strong garrison in the village, most of the militia returned to their homes.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 121<U+2013>122</ref>

The raiders destroyed 17 of the village's 41 homes, and looted many of the others.  They killed 44 residents of Deerfield: 10 men, 9 women, and 25 children, five garrison soldiers, and seven Hadley men.<ref name=M221>Melvoin, p. 221</ref>  Of those who died inside the village, 15 died of fire-related causes; most of the rest were killed by edged or blunt weapons.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 122</ref>  They took 109 villagers captive; this represented forty per cent of the village population.  They also took captive three Frenchmen who had been living among the villagers.<ref name=HS115>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 115</ref><ref name=M220/>  The raiders also suffered losses, although reports vary.  New France's Governor-General [[Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil]] reported the expedition only lost 11 men, and 22 were wounded, including Hertel de Rouville and one of his brothers.<ref name=HS123>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 123</ref><ref name=M221/>  John Williams heard from French soldiers during his captivity that more than 40 French and Indian soldiers were lost;<ref name=M221/>  Haefeli and Sweeney believe the lower French figures are more credible, especially when compared to casualties incurred in other raids.<ref name=HS123/>

==Aftermath==
For the 109 English captives, the raid was only the beginning of their troubles.  The raiders intended to take them to Canada, a {{convert|300|mi|km}} journey, in the middle of winter.  Many of the captives were ill-prepared for this, and the raiders were short on provisions. The raiders consequently engaged in a common practice: they killed those captives when it was clear they were unable to keep up.  Only 89 of the captives survived the ordeal; most of those who died of exposure or were slain en route were women and children.<ref name=HS125>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 125</ref>  In the first few days several of the captives escaped. Hertel de Rouville instructed Reverend Williams to inform the others that recaptured escapees would be tortured; there were no further escapes. (The threat was not an empty one &mdash; it was known to have happened on other raids.)<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 127</ref> The French leader's troubles were not only with his captives. The Indians had some disagreements among themselves concerning the disposition of the captives, which at times threatened to come to blows. A council held on the third day resolved these disagreements sufficiently that the trek could continue.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 130<U+2013>135</ref>

[[File:ReverendJohnWilliams.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait believed to be of [[John Williams (Reverend)|John Williams]], c. 1707]]
According to John Williams' account of his captivity, most of the party traveled up the frozen Connecticut River, then up the [[Wells River (Vermont)|Wells River]] and down the [[Winooski River]] to [[Lake Champlain]].  From there they made their way to Chambly, at which point most of the force dispersed. The captives accompanied their captors to their respective villages.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 129</ref>  Williams' wife Eunice, weak after having given birth just six weeks earlier, was one of the first to be killed during the trek; her body was recovered and reburied in the Deerfield cemetery.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 128</ref>

Calls went out from the governors of the northern colonies for action against the French colonies. Governor Dudley wrote that "the destruction of Quebeck {{sic}} and [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] [would] put all the Navall stores into Her Majesty's hands, and forever make an end of an Indian War",<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 191</ref> the frontier between Deerfield and Wells was fortified by upwards of 2,000 men,<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 190</ref> and the bounty for Indian scalps was more than doubled, from <U+00A3>40 to <U+00A3>100.<ref>Melvoin, p. 229</ref>  Dudley promptly organized a retaliatory raid against [[Acadia]] (present-day [[Nova Scotia]]). In the summer of 1704, New Englanders under the leadership of [[Benjamin Church (military officer)|Benjamin Church]] [[Raid on Grand Pr<U+00E9>|raided Acadian villages]] at [[Fort Pentagouet|Pentagouet]] (present-day [[Castine, Maine]]), [[Passamaquoddy Bay]] (present-day [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick]]), [[Grand-Pr<U+00E9>, Nova Scotia|Grand Pr<U+00E9>]], [[Pisiquid]], and [[Beaubassin]] (all in present-day Nova Scotia). Church's instructions included the taking of prisoners to exchange for those taken at Deerfield, and specifically forbade him to attack the fortified capital, Port Royal.<ref>Clark, p. 220</ref>

Deerfield and other communities collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian masters. Within a year's time, most of the captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that was fairly common at the time on both sides.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 147</ref> The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to [[Roman Catholicism]], with modest success.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 157<U+2013>163</ref>  

Some of the younger captives, however, were not ransomed, as they were adopted into the tribes.  Such was the case with Williams' daughter [[Eunice Williams|Eunice]], who was eight years old when captured. She became thoroughly assimilated, and married a Mohawk man when she was 16.  Other captives also remained by choice in Canadian and Native communities such as [[Kahnawake]] for the rest of their lives.<ref name="attack2">{{Cite web| url =http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/feb29.html

Negotiations for the release and exchange of captives began in late 1704, and continued until late 1706.  They became entangled in unrelated issues (like the English capture of French [[privateer]] [[Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste]]), and larger concerns, including the possibility of a wider-ranging treaty of neutrality between the French and English colonies.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 165</ref>  Mediated in part by Deerfield residents John Sheldon and John Wells, some captives (including [[Noel Doiron]]) were returned to Boston in August 1706.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 173</ref>  Governor Dudley, who needed the successful return of the captives for political reason, then released the French captives, including Baptiste; the remaining captives who chose to return were back in Boston by November 1706.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 174</ref>

==Legacy==
John Williams wrote a [[captivity narrative]] about his experience, which was published in 1707.  The work was widely distributed in the 18th and 19th centuries, and continues to be published today (see Further Reading below).  Williams' work was one of the reasons this raid, unlike others of the time, was remembered and became an element in the American frontier story.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 273</ref>  In the 19th century the raid began to be termed a [[List of events named massacres|massacre]] (where previous accounts had used words like "destruction" and "sack", emphasizing the physical destruction); this terminology was still in use in mid-20th century Deerfield.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 273<U+2013>274</ref>

A portion of the original village of Deerfield [[Historic Deerfield|has been preserved]] as a living history museum; among its relics is a door bearing tomahawk marks from the 1704 raid.<ref>Johnson and Smith, p. 44</ref><ref name=HD>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-deerfield.org/|accessdate=2011-01-17|publisher=Historic Deerfield, Inc.|title=Historic Deerfield}}</ref>  The raid is commemorated there in [[leap year]]s.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 272</ref>

An 1875 legend recounts the attack as an attempt by the French to regain a bell, supposedly destined for Quebec, but pirated and sold to Deerfield.  The legend continues that this was a "historical fact known to almost all school children."<ref>Child, p. 23</ref>  However, the story, which is a common Kahnawake tale, was refuted as early as 1882.<ref>Haefeli and Sweeney, pp. 275<U+2013>276</ref>
