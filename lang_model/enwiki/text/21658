A '''''pyxis''''' ({{lang|el|<U+03C0><U+03C5><U+03BE><U+03AF><U+03C2>}}, plural ''pyxides'') is a shape of vessel from the classical world, usually a cylindrical box with a separate lid.  Originally mostly used by women to hold cosmetics, trinkets or jewellery, surviving ''pyxides'' are mostly [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Greek pottery]], but especially in later periods may be in wood, metal, [[ivory]], or other materials.  The name derived from Corinthian boxes made of wood from the tree ''puksos'' ([[Buxus sempervirens|boxwood]]), that also came with covers. The shape of the vessel can be traced in pottery back to the [[Protogeometric period]] in Athens, however the Athenian ''pyxis'' has various shapes itself.  At first, the two varieties of ''pyxis'' included the pointed and the flat-bottomed. The pointed ''pyxis'' didn't last much longer than the ninth century BCE, while the flat-bottomed continued into the late [[Geometric art|Geometric]].  It also continued to grow larger and more squat in proportions.  The cover often depicts elaborately sculpted handles and the walls tend to be somewhat convex. During the sixth century BCE, however, Athens began producing boxes with concave walls that enabled them to be grasped easily when ranged close together on a shelf.  Compare the waisted shape of the medieval and Early Modern [[albarello]].  Images on the ''pyxis'' usually depict the marriage procession from a young girl's house to that of her new husband.

[[Pyx]] is a term for a specifically [[liturgical]] box, usually cylindrical, but of variable design, still used for holding and transporting [[Sacramental bread|consecrated hosts]] in the traditional Christian churches, a use to which the church began to put these boxes at a very early date.
