[[Image:XFL commercial.jpg|thumb|right|Karen McDougal (background) in a ''XFL'' cheerleader commercial]]
McDougal appeared in a series of sexy [[TV commercials]] for ''[[XFL]]'' football league on [[NBC]] and [[UPN]] with the theme of "Cheerleaders" along with [[Pennelope Jimenez]], Rachel Sterling and other models in 2000. The most famous one featured her as one of many cheerleaders taking a shower in a [[locker room]] setting. Using clever camera angles and strategically placed objects, the commercial gave viewers the titillating illusion that the cheerleaders were nude in the shower with little left to the imagination.<ref>Schatz, Aaron.

In 2001, she co-starred with [[Lisa Dergan]] in ''[[The Arena (2001 film)|The Arena]]'', a [[Roger Corman]]-produced, [[direct-to-video]] movie directed by [[Timur Bekmambetov]]. The entire production was shot in [[Russia]]. In her feature film debut, McDougal's character, Jessemina, is a slave girl who is forced into fighting as a [[female gladiators|female gladiator]] in an Ancient Roman colony by its corrupt [[Roman Governor|governor]]. The role offered McDougal her first opportunity to act in a dramatic role and to demonstrate her physical abilities with the movie's [[swordsmanship|sword fighting]] sequences. The movie, initially titled ''Gladiatrix'' was deemed to be a knockoff of ''[[Gladiator (2000 movie)|Gladiator]]''. Although the movie was not well received, it has turned into a lesser known [[cult film]].<ref>[http://www.joebobbriggs.com/drivein/2001/arena.htm "The Arena" review] by [[Joe Bob Briggs]] Retrieved on October 20, 2006 </ref>

Many regard her as a favorite Playmate in recent years because of her combination of beauty, "[[Girl next door]]" appeal and curvaceous figure, according to a November 2001 ''Playboy'' poll in the special edition ''Sexiest Playmates''. In that issue, she was voted "Readers' Choice No.2 Sexiest Playmate of the 1990s" ([[Pamela Anderson]] was voted No.1).<ref name="Aboutk"/>

''Playboy'' released a [[Playboy Collectors' Figure Series|limited edition doll]] in 2002 based on the likeness of McDougal and emphasized that it was an anatomically correct and accurate model of her statuesque physique. Her collectors' figure was originally slated to be the first in the series to be released, however it was delayed due to redesigns.<ref> [http://www.toymania.com/features/playboy.shtml Raving Toy Maniac presents "A Playmate of Your Own"] Retrieved on October 20, 2006 </ref> She was one of twelve contestants in the search for the new host succeeding [[Brooke Burke]] for ''Wild On!'' in 2002 (known as ''Wild Off!''). The contest took place at [[The Palms]] in Las Vegas. Each contestant was given a "wild" challenge to complete and McDougal's challenge was to dress up as [[Cleopatra]] and roam the [[casino]] at [[Caesars Palace]] in the arms of an actor dressed up as [[Julius Caesar]] for a day. She completed her challenge and was considered an early favorite by fellow contestants, but did not advance to the final round of 5 contestants.<ref>{{cite visual | crew=McDougal, Karen (Herself) | date=1998 | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0748398|title= Wild On!: Wild Off!
