'''''{{Nihongo|Strawberry Marshmallow|<U+82FA><U+307E><U+3057><U+307E><U+308D>|Ichigo Mashimaro}}''''' is a [[manga]] series by [[mangaka]] [[Barasui]] about the adventures of four elementary school girls and a high school student. It was created by Barasui for the comic magazine ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' in 2001. In 2005, the series was adapted into an [[anime]] series and a [[PlayStation 2]] game. 

In the manga, the plot in each story tends to follow two paths. Either it centers on everyday events and conversation, or it revolves around some prank instigated by Miu and the other characters' participation in or attempts to thwart said prank.

The animated episodes usually contain two or more plots from the manga, often from both categories mentioned above. 

The manga has been licensed and is published by [[Tokyopop]] in both the [[United States]] and [[Germany]].

== Characters ==
(Note: Because Japanese is a [[head (linguistics)|head-final]] language, the first and last names are reversed in the original version of Ichigo Mashimaro. The names displayed below are adapted to fit English standards. Ana Coppola is an exception because her name is British.)

|[[Hitomi Nabatame]]
|rowspan="2"|[[Image:Nobue_Itoh.jpg|150px|Nobue]]
|-
|colspan="2"|A 16-year-old high school student with very lazy study habits and a tendency to sub-conciously reach for a smoke. She is depicted to be 20 years old in the PS2 game and the anime to comply with regulations against depictions of underage drinkers or smokers {{citeneeded}}. She is Chika's older sister and usually has final authority on all matters. She often tries to 'borrow' some money from Chika to buy cigarettes and usually comforts Matsuri and Ana in favor of the others. Nobue is perpetually searching for a part-time job to earn money for more cigarettes. The story suggests, through several common manga devices, that Nobue derives some kind of sensual pleasure from watching the girls do cute things. In this respect, Nobue appears to appreciate the moe [[aesthetic]]. She is mostly referred to as ''Onee-chan'' ('older sister'; although she is only related to Chika, all the girls seem to call her this) or ''Nobu-onee-chan''. 

Nobue first introduces herself in the anime as a "typical 16 year old high school student", but then quickly claims it's a lie and she is 20 just after lighting a cigarette. Despite this proclamation nothing else in the show suggests that she is 20. It is a common joke in hentai and anime games to claim a character is 20 when they clearly aren't in order to get around censorship laws.{{citeneeded}}

|-
|colspan="2"|While being 12 years old, this cheerful girl has a little more common sense than the other girls (especially Miu). Her special skill is cooking, especially in baking cookies. She is in the same class as Miu and is Nobue's little sister. She is nicknamed ''Chi-chan'' or just ''Chi''.

|rowspan="2"|[[Image:MiuMatsuoka.jpg|150px|Miu]]
|-
|colspan="2"|Another 12-year-old girl, with a bit of a problem-child personality. A childhood friend of Chika, she lives next door to the Itohs and is attends the same class as Chika. Miu likes to say random things out of the blue and often plays pranks on Matsuri and Ana, but is most of the time interrupted by Nobue (and sometimes by Chika), ending up lying face-down on the floor. She has the least common sense or manners of all the girls, and is rarely taken seriously because of her weird ideas and comments. She seems to harbor some sort of jealousy of Ana and Matsuri, because Nobue finds them cuter. Miu is nicknamed ''Mi-chan''.

|colspan="2"|Matsuri is an 11-year-old glasses-wearing girl with a pet ferret and a very timid personality. She is often the subject of Miu's teasing and can resort to crying and hiding behind Nobue. She is one grade below Chika and Miu, in the same class as Ana. Because of that, they quickly became friends, even if she was a little nervous at their first encounter.  She is fond of the book "Haly Potey" (a parody of [[Harry Potter]]) {{dubious|Haly Potey}}.

|-
|colspan="2"|Ana is an 11-year-old girl who originally came from [[Cornwall]], England five years before the series, but seems to have forgotten how to speak English. She first pretends that she speaks only English, but it's not long before she is discovered by Matsuri while speaking very polite Japanese. Matsuri tries to helps her re-learn English. Ana is often teased by Miu because of her name, Ana Koppora, which in [[kanji]] read from left to right as 'hole', 'bones' and 'cave'. Miu nicknamed her 'Coppola-chan', much to her grief. Ana's 'proper Japanese' personality is reflected by her very traditionally feminine and polite speaking style: She ends every sentence with "wa", speaks in a high falsetto and refers to Nobue as "Onee-sama".
