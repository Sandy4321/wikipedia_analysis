In [[fortification]], a '''banquette''' is a little foot path or elevated step along the inside of a [[rampart]] or [[parapet]], by which the musketeers get up to view the [[counterscarp]], or to fire on the enemies in the [[moat]]. These are generally a foot and a half high, and almost three feet wide.
