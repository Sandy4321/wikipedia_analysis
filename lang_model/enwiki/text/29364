==Plot==
The film begins with a young [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] woman offering a prayer to Mother Earth. While never referred to by name, she is understood to be [[Pocahontas]]. The woman and others from her tribe witness the arrival of three ships. It is Virginia, the year 1607, and the ships are part of the Jamestown Expedition, sent by English royal charter to found a colony in the "New World." Aboard one of the ships we see a man, later identified as [[Captain John Smith]], below decks, in chains. While initially sentenced to death by hanging for his mutinous remarks, once ashore, Smith is pardoned by Captain [[Christopher Newport]], the leader of the expedition.

While the prospects for the settlement are initially bright, disease, poor discipline, supply shortages, and tensions with the local Native Americans (who Newport calls "the naturals" rather than "the savages" used by Radcliffe in the [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|1995 Disney film]]) place the expedition in jeopardy. Smith is given the opportunity to restore his reputation by taking a small group of men up river to seek trade while Newport returns to England for supplies. While on this mission, Smith is captured by a group of Native Americans and brought before their chief. After being questioned, the captain is nearly executed but is spared when one of the chief's daughters (the same young woman from the beginning of the film) throws herself across his body, saving his life.

Living among the Native Americans as a prisoner for an extended period, Smith is treated well, earning the friendship and respect of the tribe. Coming to admire this new way of life, he falls deeply in love with Pocahontas, who is greatly intrigued by the Englishman and his ways. Slowly Smith begins to question the validity of his earlier life. The chief, however, eventually returns Smith to Jamestown with the understanding that the English are to leave the following spring once their boats have returned.

Upon his return Smith encounters a settlement in turmoil. Pressed into accepting the governorship, he finds the peace and happiness he had experienced in the wilderness replaced by privation, death, and the difficult responsibilities that come with his new position. Smith wishes to return to his love but dismisses such action, labeling his time among the Native Americans as "a dream" that he has now awoken from. As their numbers dwindle throughout the brutal winter, the settlers are saved only when Pocahontas and a rescue party arrives with food, clothing, and supplies.

As spring arrives it becomes clear to Chief Powhatan that the English did not intend to leave. Discovering his daughter's actions, he orders an attack on Jamestown and exiles Pocahontas. Repulsing the attack, the settlers learn of Pocahontas' banishment and organize a trade so that the young woman can be taken captive and used as leverage to avoid further assaults. Smith strongly opposes the plan and as a result is removed as Governor and despoiled by the new leadership.

With Pocahontas now living in Jamestown, she and Smith renew their love affair. However, with the return of Captain Newport, complications arise. Newport informs Smith that the king has offered him the opportunity to lead a new expedition of his own which will seek an elusive new passage to the East Indies. Torn between his love and the promise of his career, the captain eventually makes the difficult decision to return to England. Before he departs, however, he leaves instructions with a trusted settler who later informs Pocahontas that Smith has died in the crossing.

Devastated, Pocahontas sinks into a deep depression. Continuing to live in Jamestown, she is eventually comforted by a new settler, John Rolfe, who helps her better adapt to the English way of life. She is subsequently baptized, receives education, and eventually marries Rolfe and gives birth to a son. While she is happy with her new life, she soon learns that Captain Smith is still alive. Realizing that she is still in love with him, her relationship with her husband is complicated.

Ultimately, Rolfe and his family are given an opportunity to travel to England. Arriving in London and sharing an audience with the king and queen, Pocahontas is overwhelmed by the wonders of this "New World." While there, a private meeting is arranged between Pocahontas and Smith. Rolfe supports the meeting, believing that his wife still loves Smith and that she will not be at peace until she sees him again.

The reunion is uncomfortable at times as the love the two shared years before reminds them of the happiness they once felt, while the state of their present lives exposes how much they each have changed. Smith admits that he may have made a mistake in choosing his career over his love for Pocahontas, stating that what they experienced in the wilderness was not a dream but instead "the only truth." The two depart, never to meet again.

Embracing her husband, Pocahontas and Rolfe make arrangements to return to Virginia. However, on the outward passage, she falls ill and suddenly dies. The film ends with images of Pocahontas and her young son playing in the gardens of their English estate as Rolfe, in a voice over, reads a letter, addressed to their son about his deceased mother. In the film's closing moments, Pocahontas says "Mother, now I know where you live", having found peace through her strength to grow past her wounds, the film ends with images of nature.

==Production==
===Filming===
The film was shot on location at the [[Chickahominy River]], a tributary of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] not far from the site of the real events, and other nearby locations. Reconstructions of the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] settlement and of the [[Powhatan]] village were created, based on archaeological evidence and intuition. Tools and materials used were of the geographical and technological environment of the setting. The attention paid to authenticity was of such a level that strains of Indian corn and tobacco were sought out and planted, rather than to settle for strains that are commonly found today. The England scenes were filmed at [[Hampton Court Palace]] and [[Hatfield House]], near [[London]], and outside the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]]. Blair Rudes, [[professor]] of [[linguistics]] at [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte|UNC-Charlotte]], re-created the [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Powhatan language]] ([[Virginia]]n [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]) for the film.<ref>msnbc: How a linguist revived 'New World' language. http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10950199</ref>

''The New World'' is the first studio feature in nine years to be at least partially shot on [[65 mm film]] (for non-visual effect shots). The previous one was [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), which was filmed entirely in 65&nbsp;mm.

===Editing and delays===
The film was originally set to be released in November 2005, but release had to be postponed as Malick was still editing the enormous amount of footage he had shot; the director is notorious for editing his films until the last minute,<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/dial-d-for-disaster-the-fall-of-new-line-cinema-809545.html Dial 'D' for disaster: The fall of New Line Cinema - Features, Films.] The Independent | News | UK and Worldwide News | Newspaper: April 16, 2008</ref> often trimming his films and leaving entire characters out of the final print, as is the case with ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]''.

In early December, a 150-minute version was shown to critics for awards season consideration and was released for a week from Christmas to New Year's Day in two theaters each in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York]] to qualify for the [[Academy Awards]].

For the film's wide release, which began on January 20, 2006, Malick re-edited the film again, cutting it to 135 minutes, but also adding footage not seen in the first release and altering some of the film's extensive voiceovers to clarify the plot. Substantial changes were made to the first half-hour of the picture, seemingly to speed the plot along.<ref>[http://www.realalternativesite.com/the-new-world-a-2347.html The New World. - Real Alternative Site (ras).] "Alternative ways to look at the world we live in today."</ref> This version is the one released on DVD worldwide. The 150 minute version only saw DVD release  in Italy as part of Italian distributor Eagle Pictures 2-disc set containing both the "short" and "long" version of the film.

A 172-minute version dubbed "The Extended Cut" was issued by New Line on DVD in October 2008.<ref>[http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/artman2/publish/movie_news/DVD-Review-The-New-World-2005-11061008.php The Hollywood News - DVD Review: The New World (2005).] Oct 6, 2008.</ref>

===Soundtrack===
The effect of Malick's editing also resulted in a partial rejection of [[James Horner]]'s score. Horner wrote and rewrote his score to scenes that were switched around, massively reedited, or thrown out of the film completely. His score then did not fit the film or did not make chronological sense in the film. For the final version, Malick combined pieces of Horner's music with the prelude to  Wagner's ''[[Das Rheingold|Rheingold]]'', Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 23 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 23]], and other pieces  to create the score to the film. Most of Horner's score as written for the film can be heard on the CD release.

==Historical accuracy==
Malick's film selectively blends recorded history with popular lore.  It broadly follows the known life of Pocahontas, from her youth in the [[Powhatan]] village, to a period spent with the English settlers in Jamestown, her marriage to John Rolfe, her journey to [[London]] and early death; however, Malick diverges from available evidence in favor of the literary tradition that Pocahontas fell in love with John Smith. The film depicts Smith leaving Jamestown on orders from the king; he then has the settlers tell Pocahontas that he drowned. In reality, Smith left Jamestown because of an injury when his powder horn  exploded and almost blew off his leg. Pocahontas was told he died on the trip to England.  In the film, Pocahontas is shown being kidnapped by the settlers when Smith is still in Jamestown. In reality, Smith had to leave from a gunpowder injury in 1609, while Pocahontas was kidnapped in 1613. Wingfield is also shown being shot by the settlers, but in reality he lived until 1630 and even wrote several books on Jamestown.

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews. The film received a "certified fresh" rating of 61% based on 166 reviews from [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Another review aggregator [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 69 out of 100 indicating "Generally Positive Reviews."<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-09-21 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/newworld |title=New World, The |publisher=Metacritic }}</ref> Some heaped praise upon the picture for its cinematography and the strength of the performances while others criticized its slow pacing and unfocused plot. [[Roger Ebert]] praised the film awarding it four (out of four) stars and lauding Malick as a "visionary." Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' hailed the film as "a masterpiece" while numerous others such as Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' gave the film positive reviews. On the other hand, [[Stephen Hunter]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' faulted the film for being "stately almost to the point of being static" while others such as [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' criticized it as "sluggish," "underdramatized," and "emotionally remote."

In November 2009, ''[[Time Out New York]]'' ranked the film as the fourth-best of the decade, saying: 
<blockquote>"The particular power of this [[tone poem]] comes from how quietly resigned both characters are to their fates, as if they sense a guiding hand in their every action. The final passages of Malick<U+2019>s [[idyll]], after Pocahontas takes a fateful ocean journey, are the finest work of his career, most notably in his portrayal of the princess<U+2019>s death and transfiguration<U+2014>a shattering five-minute sequence that never fails to move."<ref> {{cite web

In January 2010, [[Mick LaSalle]] of the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] named it the #1 film of the decade.
<blockquote>"Terence Malick's one-of-a-kind film, about the life of Pocahontas and the dawn of American history, contains some of the best filmmaking imaginable - some of it beyond imagining. I have seen it at least five times and have no idea how Malick knew, when he put it all together, that the movie would even make sense. It's difficult to write a great short poem. It's difficult to write a great long novel. But to write a great long poem that's the size of a great long novel - one that makes sense, doesn't flag and is exponentially better than the short poem or the long novel ever would have been - that's almost impossible. Malick did it. With images."<ref>Mick LaSalle, ''Top films of the decade'', San Francisco Chronicle, 1 January 2010. <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/01/MVK31B78QT.DTL&type=movies></ref></blockquote>
