===Cascade Investments===
While trying to buy a Chicago based money-management firm, Larson received a call from a head hunter, Bert Early. Early represented [[Bill Gates]], who was looking for a money-manager at the time. Early had heard of Larson from a few investors in Tacoma, WA. The hiring process was extensive, given the amount of money Larson would be running for Gates. Larson was hired after a successful interview with Gates in [[Seattle]]. In 1994, Larson and his wife moved to Seattle.<ref name = fortune19990315/> 
Larson called the investment shop [[Cascade Investment| Cascade Investments]] because the generic name would allow him to operate in the market without drawing attention. Larson has and continues to operate under the radar with the exception of a rare interview with Fortune in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldie|first=Paul|title=Meet the man who runs Bill Gates's money|url=http://www.globeadvisor.com/servlet/ArticleNews/story/gam/20061107/RGATES07|accessdate=July 26, 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=November 7, 2006}}</ref>  

When Larson started at Cascade, informally known as BGI ([[Bill Gates]] Investments), he was the only employee. He quickly hired Alan Heuberger, a fellow graduate of [[Claremont McKenna College]]. Heuberger is now number two at the firm. Larson originally ran 11.5 billion of the Gates fortune and foundation but that has swelled tremendously over the years as Gates sells his [[Microsoft]] stock. Although an actual statement isn't released, it's believed that Larson manages well over 80 billion year to date. This number includes [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation| The Gates Foundation]] as well as Gates's personal wealth.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Serwer|first=Andy|title=Still a great job: Making sure Bill Gates stays rich|journal=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=May 3,  2004|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/05/03/368564/index.htm}}</ref>
