'''Ed Woll''' ( &ndash;2010 ) was an [[United States|American]] Engineer who developed the first modern [[gas turbine]] engines for [[General Electric]].<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Aviation Week and Space Technology|date=3 January 2011}}</ref>

Woll led development of the [[General Electric T58|T58]], [[General Electric T64|T64]], and [[General Electric T700|T700]] [[Turboshaft]] engines. Woll also led the [[General Electric F404|F404]], [[General Electric F101|F101]], [[General Electric F110|F110]] [[Turbojet]] military engines and [[General Electric GE38|GE27]], and [[CFM International CFM56|CFM56]] civilian engines.<ref>{{cite book|title=The history of North American small gas turbine aircraft engines|author=Richard A. Leyes, William A. Fleming}}</ref>

== Early life ==

In 1946 Woll worked at the Power Plant Laboratory at [[Wright-Patterson Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in [[California]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Seven decades of progress: a heritage of aircraft turbine technology|author=General Electric}}</ref>

Woll developed the [[afterburner]] for the [[Allison J35|J35]] engine, later developing the [[General Electric J47|J47]] variable afterburner.

== GE career ==
Woll led the General Electric T58 and T64 [[helicopter]] and [[turboprop]] engine programs starting in 1953 with innovations such as corrosion-resistant high-temperature coatings.

Woll was a lead in developing the [[General Electric J85|J85]], [[General Electric CJ610|CJ610]], and [[General Electric CF700|CF700]] engines which enabled lightweight jet fighters, such as the [[Northrop F-5]], [[Northrop T-38]] trainers, and early business jets like the [[LearJet]] and [[Dassault Falcon 20|Fanjet Falcon]]. Woll resisted the urge to consolidate GE engineering, saving the GE's [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]] (MA) River Works from shutdown.<ref>{{cite book|title=The power to fly: an engineer's life|author= Brian H. Rowe, Martin Ducheny}}</ref>

In 1964, Woll led development of the {{convert|14,300|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust GE15 (later [[General Electric YJ101|YJ101]]) which evolved into the [[General Electric F404|F404]] used in the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] and other aircraft.<ref>{{cite book|title=Starting something big: the commercial emergence of GE aircraft engines|author=Robert V. Garvin}}</ref>

Woll later led the F101X, evolving (via the "Great Engine War")<ref>http://www.dodbuzz.com/2010/07/15/the-great-engine-war-is-over/</ref> into the [[General Electric F110|F110]] used to re-engine the F-14, F-15, and F-16.

Championing customer service and support, Woll retired in 1979 after developing the [[CF6]], and [[CFM56]] with [[Snecma]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The history of North American small gas turbine aircraft engines|author=Richard A. Leyes, William A. Fleming}}</ref>
