{{Audio|Trondheim.ogg|'''Trondheim'''}} is a city and municipality in the county of [[S<U+00F8>r-Tr<U+00F8>ndelag]], Norway. 

The city of Trondheim was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). The rural municipalities of [[Byneset]], [[Leinstrand]], [[Strinda]] and [[Tiller, Norway|Tiller]] were merged with Trondheim January 1, 1964.

The city of Trondheim was founded in [[997]]. Trondheim is today a centre of education, technical and medical research, with around 25,000 students, 
and is the country's third-largest city, 
with 162,000 inhabitants in the city proper (January 2007). The [[Trondheim Region]] has 246,751 inhabitants.

== Geography and climate ==
Trondheim is situated where the river [[Nidelva]] meets a large [[fjord]], [[Trondheimsfjord]]en, and is the centre of the Trondheim Region. At summer [[solstice]], the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon - there is no darkness from [[May 20]] to [[July 20]] ([http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/trondheim.html]). At winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:00, stays very low above the horizon, and sets at 14:30. Trondheim has a predominantly [[maritime climate]] ([http://www.worldweather.org/008/c00907.htm]), but mostly sheltered from the more windy conditions on the coast. The warmest temperature ever recorded is 35<U+00B0>C on [[July 22]] [[1901]], and the coldest is -26.1<U+00B0>C in February [[1899]] ([[Geography of Norway#climate|[1]]]). The municipality's top elevation is the [[Storheia]] hill, 565 metres (<U+2248>1850 ft) above sea level.

== Institutions ==
The [[cathedral]] of Trondheim, [[Nidaros Cathedral]], is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in [[Scandinavia]] after [[Uppsala Cathedral]]. The [[synagogue]] is among the most northern in the world. The main regional [[theatre]], Tr<U+00F8>ndelag Teater, is situated in Trondheim (which is also the oldest theater in Northern Europe still in use). The [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]] university is located in Trondheim, as is the regional hospital, (St Olavs Hospital). A new hospital is currently being built <ref>[http://www.helsebygg.com/ The Hospital Development Project for Central Norway]</ref>, with projected costs of 12 billion [[Norwegian krone|NOK]]. [[SINTEF]], the largest independent research organisation in [[Scandinavia]], has 1800 employees with 1300 of these located in Trondheim<ref>[http://www.sintef.no/content/page1____328.aspx About us - SINTEF]</ref>. The local newspaper is ''[[Adresseavisen]]'', the oldest active newspaper in Norway (established [[1767]]) which also owns the regional television channel TVAdressa and the radio channel RadioAdressa.

{{Unreferencedsection|date=June 2007}} 
[[Image:Trondheim, Norwegen, Speicherh<U+00E4>user 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of [[Nidelva]], seen downstream from the Old Town Bridge. Some storehouses shown to the left had [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, for hoisting goods from boats below.]]
People have been living in this region of the country for thousands of years (see [[Rock carvings in Central Norway]], [[N<U+00F8>stvet and Lihult cultures]] and [[Corded Ware culture]]).  In ancient times the Kings of Norway were hailed at <U+00D8>retinget in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the river [[Nidelva]]. Harald Fairhair (865 - 933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, Haakon I - called 'the Good'.
Trondheim was named ''Kaupangen'' (''the market place or trading place'') by [[Viking]] King [[Olav Tryggvason]] in [[997]] [[Anno Domini|AD]]. Fairly soon, it came to be called ''[[Nidaros]]''. In the beginning it was frequently used as the seat of the King, and therefore, for a time, the [[capital]] of Norway (until 1217).  

[[Leif Ericson]] lived in Trondheim around [[1000]] AD as a military retainer ([[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]: "hird"-man) of King Olav. A statue of Leif, donated by the "Leif Ericsson Society" in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming Hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle marina.

[[Image:oldbridgetrondheim.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The [[Old Town Bridge]], Trondheim.]]
Trondheim is located at the mouth of the river [[Nidelva]], due to its excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17<sup>th</sup> century.

The major battle of ''Kalvskinnet'' took place here in [[1179]]: King [[Sverre Sigurdsson]] and his ''Birkebeiner'' warriors were victorious against [[Erling Skakke]] (a rival to the throne).

Trondheim was the seat of the (Catholic) [[Archdiocese|Archbishopric]] for Norway from 1152. Due to the introduction of Lutheran [[Protestantism]] in [[1537]], the last Archbishop [[Olav Engelbrektsson]] had to flee from the city to the [[Seventeen Provinces|Netherlands]], where he died in present-day [[Lier, Belgium]].

The city has experienced several major fires. Since it was a city of log buildings, out of wood, most fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, 1717 (two fires that year), 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842.  It must be noted that these were only the worst cases. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the "Horneman Fire") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General [[Johan Caspar von Cicignon]] (originally from [[Luxembourg]]). Broad avenues like ''Munkegaten'' were made, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire.  This gave the sleepy provincial town of roughly 8000 inhabitants a certain flair.

After the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] [[26 February]] [[1658]], Trondheim (together with the rest of [[Tr<U+00F8>ndelag]]) became Swedish territory for a brief period; the area was reconquered after 10 months; the conflict was finally settled by the [[Treaty of Copenhagen]], [[27 May]] [[1660]].

During World War II, Trondheim was occupied by German forces from April, 1940 (on the first day of the invasion of Norway, ''[[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung]]'') until the war's end in Europe, [[VE Day|8 May 1945]].

===The city's names===
[[Image:Trondheim, Norway panorama.jpg|350px|left|thumb|Panoramic view of Trondheim in the winter.]]
Originally given the name '''Kaupangen''' ("Marketplace") by Olav Tryggvason, Trondheim was for a long time called '''Nidaros''' ("Mouth of the river Nid"), or in the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] spelling '''Ni<U+00F0>ar<U+00F3>ss'''. In the late [[Middle Ages]] the [[Geographical renaming|name was changed]] to '''Trondheim''' (Old Norse spelling '''<U+00DE>r<U+00F3>ndheimr'''). In the [[Dano-Norwegian]] period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of [[Denmark-Norway]], the city name was spelled '''Trondhjem'''. The words ''heimr'', ''heim'' and ''hjem'' all mean home, the word Trond is a tribal name, i.e. ''Home of the Tr<U+00F8>nders''.

Following the example set by the [[Kristiania|renaming of the nation's capital]], ''Nidaros'' was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period [[1 January]] [[1930]]&ndash;[[6 March]] [[1931]]. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 referendum on the name of the city had given this result: 17,163 votes in favour of ''Trondhjem'' and 1,508 votes in favour of ''Nidaros''. Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of [[riot]]s, forced the [[Storting]] to settle for the medieval city name '''Trondheim'''. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from ''Trondhjem stift'' to ''Nidaros bisped<U+00F8>mme'' '[[diocese of Nidaros]]' already in 1918 - and this still remains.

'''Trondheimen''' historically indicates the area around the [[Trondheimsfjord]]. The spelling ''Trondhjem'' was officially rejected, but many still prefer the now unofficial spelling of the city name: ''Trondhjem''. Today, most inhabitants still refer to their city in their local [[dialect]] (Tr<U+00F8>ndersk) as "Tronn-yam", where "tronn" rhymes with "gone".

The traditional German version of the city's name was ''Drontheim''. During the [[Nazi German]] occupation, 1940&ndash;45, the Germans made it into a major base for submarines ([[DORA 1]]) and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city of 300,000 inhabitants, ''Neu-Drontheim'' (New Trondheim), centered 15 km (10 mi) southeast of Trondheim, near the wetlands of <U+00D8>ysand in the outskirts of [[Melhus]] municipality. The new city &mdash; northern capital of a Germanized [[Scandinavia]] &mdash; was meant to be the future German main naval base of the North Atlantic region, and would be the largest of all German naval bases. Today, there are few physical remains of this giant construction project. <ref>[http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article712500.ece Hitlers dr<U+00F8>m om Trondheim] {{no_icon}}</ref>

==City boroughs==
[[Image:Trondheim from Kuhaugen.jpg|thumb|400px|Overlooking the harbor in Trondheim.]]

==Main sights==
[[Image:Nidarosdomen.jpg|thumb|220px|The Nidaros Cathedral, seen from the southern bank of the Nidelven river.]]

===Nidaros Cathedral===
{{Unreferencedsection|date=June 2007}}
[[Nidaros Cathedral]] and [[Trondheim Archbishop's Palace|Archbishop's Palace]] are located side by side, in the middle of historic Trondheim. The large cathedral, built from [[1070]] on, is the most important [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages {{Fact|date=June 2007}}, with pilgrimage routes from [[Oslo]] in southern Norway and from the [[J<U+00E4>mtland]] and [[V<U+00E4>rmland]] regions of neighbouring [[Sweden]].

During the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in [[1814]], the Nidaros Cathedral has been the [[coronation]] church of Norwegian kings. [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] was the last monarch to be crowned in [[1906]]. Starting with [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]] in 1957, coronation was replaced by [[anointing]]. In 1991, the present [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Queen Sonja]] were anointed in the cathedral. On [[May 24]], [[2002]], their daughter [[Princess M<U+00E4>rtha Louise of Norway|Princess M<U+00E4>rtha Louise]] married writer [[Ari Behn]] in the same cathedral.

Recently the [[pilgrimage]] route to [[Nidaros]] Cathedral, the site of Saint Olav's tomb, has been re-instated. Following the Norwegian spelling the route is known as [[Saint Olav's Way]]. The main route, which is approximately 640 km long, starts in [[Oslo]] and heads North, along the lake [[Mj<U+00F8>sa]], up the valley [[Gudbrandsdalen]], over the mountain range [[Dovrefjell]] and down the valley [[Oppdal]] to end at [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims, and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the aegis of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful pilgrims upon the completion of their journey.

The main downtown shopping area is concentrated around the Nordre Gate (Northern Street - pedestrian street only) and the [[Olav Tryggvason]] Gate.

In the mid- to late '90s the area surrounding the old drydock and ship construction buildings of the defunct [[Trondhjems mekaniske V<U+00E6>rksted]] shipbuilding company at the [[Nedre Elvehavn]] (Lower River Docks) were renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to give place for semi high-rise condominiums. A shopping mall was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is currently one of the most popular areas to both live and shop in, especially for younger people. 

On the south side of Trondheim, the [[City Syd]] (City South) [[shopping mall]] and adjacent malls and [[superstore]]s are popular due to the [[parking|free parking]] and relatively easy access by car compared to the congested downtown streets.

==Sports and recreation==

== Trivia ==
{{Trivia|date=June 2007}}
Although Trondheim is one of Norway's larger cities, wild animals can still be seen. [[Otter]]s thrive in Nidelva, and on bright summer nights you might meet a [[badger]] or a [[fox]] looking for something to eat. [[Moose]] and [[deer]] are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the bewildered one year old is chased away by the mother, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions.

Twice [[Academy Awards|Oscar-nominated]] [[actor|actress]], [[film director]] and [[honorary degree|honorary doctor]] at [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]] [[Liv Ullmann]] was born in [[Tokyo]] (1938), but grew up in Trondheim.

Trondheim is not only one of the major cities in Norway, it is an area of great beauty with rich natural habitats and a rich fauna. Some of Norway<U+2019>s better wetland habitats can be found within the city limits. One of the more interesting is Gaulosen.
