'''Christian Genest''' is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at [[McGill University]] (Montr<U+00E9>al, Canada), where he holds a Canada Research Chair in Stochastic Dependence Modelling.<ref name="CRC">{{cite web | url=http://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=2847 | title=Canada Research Chair |accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref> He is the author of numerous research papers in [[multivariate analysis]], [[nonparametric statistics]], [[extreme-value theory]], and [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]].

He is a recipient of the Statistical Society of Canada's Gold Medal for Research.

==Contributions==

Christian Genest is best known for developing models and statistical inference techniques for studying the dependence between variables through the concept of [[copula]]. He has designed, among others, various techniques for selecting, estimating and validating copula-based models through rank-based methods. His methodological contributions in [[multivariate analysis]] and [[extreme-value theory]] found numerous practical applications in finance, insurance, and hydrology.

Throughout his career, Christian Genest also made significant contributions to the development of techniques for the reconciliation and use of expert opinions and [[pairwise comparison]] methods used to establish priorities in [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]]. He is the author or co-author of over 200 scientific publications, about half of which appeared in peer-reviewed journals. Part of his work is also concerned with the history of statistics and scientometrics. Christian Genest has given over 250 invited talks, including 60+ presentations for a general audience.

==Birth place and education==

Christian Genest was born on January 11, 1957 in [[Chicoutimi]] (Qu<U+00E9>bec, Canada). He was trained as a mathematician at the [[Universit<U+00E9> du Qu<U+00E9>bec <U+00E0> Chicoutimi]] (B.Sp.Sc., 1977) and at the [[Universit<U+00E9> de Montr<U+00E9>al]] (M.Sc., 1978) before completing graduate studies in statistics at the [[University of British Columbia]] (Ph.D., 1983). His thesis, entitled "Towards a Consensus of Opinion",<ref name = "genealogy">{{Cite web|url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=17625|title=Christian Genest at Mathematics Genealogy Project|work=Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref> was written under the supervision of James V. Zidek and earned him the Pierre Robillard Award from the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC) in 1984.<ref name="Pierre Robillard Award">{{cite web | url=http://www.ssc.ca/en/award-winners#Pierre | title=Pierre-Robillard Award winners|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref>

==Academic career==

After completing his PhD, Christian Genest was a postdoctoral fellow and Visiting Assistant Professor at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (Pittsburgh, PA) in 1983-84. From 1984 to 1987, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the [[University of Waterloo]] (Waterloo, ON). He was then hired by [[Universit<U+00E9> Laval]] (Qu<U+00E9>bec, QC), where he was promoted to the ranks of Associate in 1989 and Professor in 1993. He joined [[McGill University]] (Montr<U+00E9>al, QC) in 2010 and has been Director of the Institut des sciences math<U+00E9>matiques du Qu<U+00E9>bec since 2012.

==Honors and prizes==
