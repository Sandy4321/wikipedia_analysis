In molecular biology '''miR-181 microRNA precursor''' is a small [[non-coding RNA]] molecule. [[MicroRNAs]] (miRNAs) are transcribed as ~70 [[nucleotide]] precursors and subsequently processed by the RNase-III type enzyme [[Dicer]] to give a ~22 nucleotide mature product. In this case the mature sequence comes from the 5' arm of the precursor. They target and modulate protein expression by inhibiting translation and / or inducing degradation of target messenger RNAs. This new class of genes has recently been shown to play a central role in malignant transformation. miRNA are downregulated in many tumors and thus appear to function as tumor suppressor genes.<ref name="pmid19822134">{{cite journal | author = Larson RA. | title = Micro-RNAs and copy number changes: new levels of gene regulation in acute myeloid leukemia. | journal = Chem Biol Interact. | volume = 184 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 21<U+2013>5 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19822134 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.10.002 }}</ref> The mature products miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-181c or miR-181d are thought to have regulatory roles at posttranscriptional level, through complementarity to target mRNAs.<ref name="pmid12624257">{{cite journal | author = Lim LP, Glasner ME, Yekta S, Burge CB, Bartel DP ''et al'' | title = Vertebrate microRNA genes | journal = Science | volume = 299 | pages = 1540 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12624257 | doi=10.1126/science.1080372 | issue=5612}}</ref> miR-181 which has been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide number of vertebrate species  as [[rat]], [[zebrafish]], and in the [[pufferfish]] (see below) ([http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sequences/mirna_summary.pl?fam=MIPF0000007 MIPF0000007]).

'''Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma'''<br />
It was found that miR-181a and miR-181c are overexpressed in Papillary Thyroid [[Carcinoma]] tumors, sufficiently to successfully predict cancer status.<ref name="pmid16365291">{{cite journal |author= He H, Jazdzewski K, Li W, Liyanarachchi S, Nagy R, Volinia S, Calin GA, Liu CG, Franssila K, Suster S, Kloos RT, Croce CM, de la Chapelle A. |title= The role of microRNA genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma. |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. |volume= 102 |issue= 52 |pages= 19075<U+2013>80 |year= 2005 |pmid= 16365291 |doi=  10.1073/pnas.0509603102 |pmc=1323209}}</ref>

'''Hepatocellular Carcinoma'''<br />
It has been shown that conserved miR-181 family were upregulated in [[EpCAM+]] [[AFP+]] [[Hepatocellular Carcinoma]] (HCC) cells and EpCAM+ HCC isolated from AFP+ tumors. In addition, miR-181 family members were highly expressed in the embryonic liver and isolated hepatic stem cells. Especially, inhibition of miR-181 leads to a reduction of the EpCAM+, the amount of HCC cells and initiate tumor capacity, whereas exogenous miR-181 expression in HCC cells resulted in an enrichment of EpCAM+ HCC cells. miR-181 could directly target hepatic transcriptional regulators of differentiation (like homeobox 2 [[CDX2]] and 6 GATA proteins binding [[GATA6]]) and an inhibitor of [[Wnt]] / [[beta-catenin]]. It suggests that miR-181 may eradicate HCC.<ref name="pmid19585654">{{cite journal |author= Ji J, Yamashita T, Budhu A, Forgues M, Jia HL, Li C |title= Identification of microRNA-181 by genome-wide screening as a critical player in EpCAM-positive hepatic cancer stem cells. |journal= Hepatology. |volume= 50 |issue= 2 |pages= 472<U+2013>80 |year= 2009 |pmid= 19585654 |doi= 10.1002/hep.22989 }}</ref>

===miR-181a roles===
'''T cell Sensitivity'''

The increased expression of miR-181a in mature [[T cells]] increases susceptibility to peptide antigens, while inhibiting the expression of miR-181a in immature T cells reduces sensitivity and alters the both positive and negative selection. In addition, the quantitative regulation of the sensitivity of T cells by miR-181a allows for mature T cells recognize peptide inhibitor antagonists, like agonists. These effects are achieved in part by downregulation of multiple [[phosphatases]], which leads to high levels of steadystate  phosphorylated intermediates and reducing the threshold of T cell receptor signaling. The expression of miR-181a correlates with a greater sensitivity of immature T cells in T cells, suggesting that miR-181a acts as an antigen intrinsic sensitivity "rheostat" during the development of T cells.<ref name="tcellsensitivity">{{cite journal | author = Qi-Jing Li, Jacqueline Chau, Peter J.R.

'''Cerebellar Neurodegeneration'''<br />
miR-181a has a relatively broad expression pattern and is present in neurons in numerous parts of the mouse brain. miR-181a is essential for the survival of [[Purkinje cells]] and its absence leads to a slow degeneration of these cells.<ref name="pmid17606634">{{cite journal |author= Schaefer A, O'Carroll D, Tan CL, Hillman D, Sugimori M, Llinas R, Greengard P. |title=  Cerebellar neurodegeneration in the absence of microRNAs. |journal= J Exp Med. |volume= 204 |issue= 7 |pages= 1553<U+2013>8 |year= 2007 |pmid= 17606634 |doi=  10.1084/jem.20070823 |pmc=2118654}}</ref>
