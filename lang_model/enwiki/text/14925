[[Atropates]] ruled over the region of [[Atropatene]] (present-day [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]).

The earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of Azerbaijan dates to the late [[Stone Age]] and is related to the [[Guruchay culture]] of the [[Azykh Cave]].<ref>[http://www.globalsocialscience.org/uploads/c_GlobalSSH%20-%20Azerbaijan%20institutional%20report%20FINAL.pdf National report on institutional landscape and research policy Social Sciences and Humanities in Azerbaijan].</ref> The [[Upper Paleolithic]] and late [[Bronze Age]] cultures are attested in the caves of [[Ta<U+011F><U+0131>lar]], [[Damc<U+0131>l<U+0131>]], [[Zar, Azerbaijan|Zar]], Yataq-yeri and in the [[necropolis]]es of Leylatepe and Saraytepe.

Early Iranian settlements included the [[Scythia]]ns in the ninth century BC.<ref name="Library of Congress Azerbaijan">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/aztoc.html Azerbaijan], ''US Library of Congress Country Studies''.

[[Caucasian Albania]]ns, the original inhabitants of the area, established an independent kingdom around the fourth century BC.

===Feudal era===
[[File:Maidentt.jpg|thumb|The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] in [[Old Baku]] is a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in the 11th<U+2013>12th century.]]
The [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] turned Caucasian Albania into a [[vassal state]] in AD 252, while King Urnayr officially adopted [[Christianity]] as the state religion in the fourth century. Despite numerous conquests by the Sassanids and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Albania remained an entity in the region until the ninth century. The Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sassanids and Byzantines from the region and turned Caucasian Albania into a vassal state after the Christian resistance, led by Prince [[Javanshir]], was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid]]s, [[Sajids]], [[Shaddadid]]s, [[Rawadid]]s and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes from [[Central Asia]]. The first of these Turkic dynasties was the [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]], which entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1030.

The [[turkification]] of the Azeris was not completed until the late 19th century. The old Iranic speakers were to be found solely in tiny isolated recesses of the mountains or other remote areas (such as Harzand, Galin Guya, Shahrud villages in Khalkhal and Anarjan). This [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking population is still known as Azeris.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new Central Asia |last=Roy |first=Olivier |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-eMcn6Ik1v0C&pg=PA7 |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=I.B.

Locally, the possessions of the subsequent [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq Empire]] were ruled by [[Atabegs of Azerbaijan|atabegs]], who were technically vassals of the Seljuq sultans, being sometimes de facto rulers themselves. Under the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], local poets such as [[Nezami|Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani|Khagani Shirvani]] gave rise to a blossoming of [[Persian literature]] on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan. The next ruling state of the [[Jalayirids]] was short-lived and fell under the conquests of [[Timur]].

The local dynasty of [[Shirvanshah]]s became a vassal state of [[Timurid dynasty|Timur's Empire]] and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death two independent and rival states emerged: [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861 until 1539. During their persecution by the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]], the last dynasty imposed [[Shia Islam]] upon the formerly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] population,<ref>Immortal: A Military History of Iran and Its Armed Forces, By Steven R.

After the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] during [[World War I]], Azerbaijan, together with [[Armenia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] became part of the short-lived [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]]. When the republic dissolved in May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence as the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR).

By March 1920, it was obvious that Soviet Russia would attack the much-needed Baku. [[Vladimir Lenin]] said that the invasion was justified as [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] could not survive without Baku [[petroleum|oil]].

As many as 20,000 Azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.<ref>Hugh Pope, "Sons of the conquerors: the rise of the Turkic world", New York: The Overlook Press, 2006, p. 116, ISBN 978-1-58567-804-4</ref>

On October 13, 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the [[Treaty of Kars]]. The previously independent Naxicivan SSR would also become autonomous ASSR within Azerbaijan by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, Armenia was awarded the region of [[Zangezur]] and Turkey agreed to return [[Gyumri]] (then known as Alexandropol).

During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union, with most of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] being supplied by Baku. By the Decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the [[petroleum industry|oil industry]] of Azerbaijan was awarded orders and medals.
[[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the German [[Wehrmacht]] targeted Baku because of its importance as the energy ([[petroleum]]) dynamo of the USSR.<ref>Swietochowski, Tadeusz(1995) ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University'', p. 133.</ref> A fifth Azerbaijanis fought in the Second World War from 1941 to 1945.

The main water sources are the surface waters. However, only 24 of the 8,350 rivers are greater than {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} in length.<ref name="GEO"/> All the rivers drain into the Caspian Sea in the east of the country.<ref name="GEO"/> The largest lake is [[Lake Sarysu|Sarysu]] (67&nbsp;km<U+00B2>), and the longest river is [[Kura River|Kur]] (1,515&nbsp;km), which is transboundary. Azerbaijan's four main islands in the Caspian Sea have a combined area of over thirty square kilometres.

[[File:Bazarduzu detail.JPG|thumb|[[Mount Bazard<U+00FC>z<U+00FC>|Mount Bazarduzu]], the highest peak of Azerbaijan, as seen from [[Mount Shahdagh]].]]
Azerbaijan is home to a vast variety of landscapes. Over half of Azerbaijan's land mass consists of mountain ridges, crests, [[yaila]]s, and plateaus which rise up to [[hypsometric]] levels of 400<U+2013>1000&nbsp;meters (including the Middle and Lower lowlands), in some places (Talis, Jeyranchol-Ajinohur and Langabiz-Alat foreranges) up to 100<U+2013>120&nbsp;metres, and others from 0 <U+2013> 50&nbsp;meters and up ([[Qobustan, Absheron]]). The rest of Azerbaijan's terrain consist of plains and lowlands. Hypsometric marks within the Caucasus region vary from about <U+2212>28&nbsp;metres at the Caspian Sea shoreline up to 4,466&nbsp;metres (Bazard<U+00FC>z<U+00FC> peak).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecologicalzones.html |title=Orography of Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Azerbaijan}}
The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold [[arctic]] [[air mass]]es of [[Scandinavia]]n [[anticyclone]], temperate of [[Siberia]]n anticyclone, and [[Central Asia]]n anticyclone.<ref name="CLIM">{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Azerbaijan <U+2013> Climate| work = | publisher = Azerbaijan.az| date = | url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Climate/_climate_e.html| doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country.<ref name="CLIM"/> The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] rates.

9 out of 11 existing [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|climate zones]] are present in Azerbaijan.<ref name="KL">{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Climate| work = Water Resources of the Azerbaijan Republic| publisher = Institute of Hydrometeorology, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources | date = | url = http://www.azhydromet.com/SRIH/Water%20Resurs.html| doi = | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> Both the absolute minimum temperature (<span style="white-space:nowrap"> {{convert|-33|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|disp=s}} </span>) and the absolute maximum temperature (<span style="white-space:nowrap"> {{convert|46|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|disp=s}} </span>) were observed in [[Julfa Rayon|Julfa]] and [[Ordubad Rayon|Ordubad]].<ref name="KL"/> The maximum annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls in [[Lankaran]] (1,600 to 1,800&nbsp;mm) and the minimum in Absheron (200 to 350&nbsp;mm).<ref name="KL"/>

===Wildlife===
{{Main|Wildlife of Azerbaijan}}
{{See|Fauna of Azerbaijan|Flora of Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Quba 452.jpg|thumb|Mountainous countryside of [[Quba Rayon|Quba]].]]
The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the animal kingdom of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in 17th century. Unlike fauna, the concept of animal kingdom covers not only the types of animals, but also the number of individual species.

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan. The symbolic representative of Azerbaijani fauna is the [[Karabakh horse]], a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. The horse was originally developed in the Azerbaijani Karabakh region in the 5th century and is named after it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralumun.com/horsekarabakh.htm |title=Karabakh Horse |publisher=Paralumun.com |date=2007-11-02 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of [[higher plants]]. Due the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |title=Azerbaijan - Flora |publisher=www.azerbaijan.az |accessdate=2010-03-05 }}</ref> About 67% of the species growing in the whole [[Caucasus]] can be found in Azerbaijan.

===Water bodies===
{{Main|Water bodies of Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Lake Khalakhi.jpg|thumb|Lake Khalakhi in the foothills of [[Zaqatala Rayon|Zaqatala]].]]
Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems.

There are 8,359 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Of them 8,188 rivers are less than 25&nbsp;kilometers in length. Only 24 rivers are over 100&nbsp;kilometers long. The [[Kura River|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the most popular rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur-Devechi and Lenkeran lowlands.

From the [[water supply]] point, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately 100,000&nbsp;m<U+00B3>/year of water per km<U+00B2>.<ref name="KL"/> All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].

===Environmental protection===
{{Main|State Reserves of Azerbaijan|National parks of Azerbaijan}}
Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani government]] has taken drastic measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan. But national protection of the environment started to truly improve after 2001 when the state budget increased due to new revenues provided by the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]]. Within four years protected areas doubled and now make up eight percent of the country's territory.

Since 2001 the government has set up seven large reserves and almost doubled the sector of the budget earmarked for environmental protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enrin.grida.no/htmls/azer/soe/ecology/html/ecology.html |title=Ecological problems in Azerbaijan |publisher=Enrin.grida.no |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}</ref>

The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to the Article 23 of Constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] of the Azerbaijan Republic are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]] and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The government of Azerbaijan is based on the [[separation of powers]] among the [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat. European observers [[Azerbaijani_parliamentary_election,_2010#Campaign_irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run up to the election and [[Azerbaijani_parliamentary_election,_2010#Election|on election day]].<ref name=Aljazeera>{{cite news|title=Monitors criticise Azeri elections|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html|publisher=[[Al-Jazeera English]]}}</ref> 

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|President]], who is elected for a 5-year term by [[direct election]]s. The president is authorized to form the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]], an inferior executive body, subordinated to him. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]], his Deputies and Ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to [[veto]] its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the Constitutional Court, [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]] and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The President nominates the judges in these courts.

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

Although Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as "not free" (on border with "partly free") in [[Freedom House]]'s [[Freedom in the World (report)|Freedom in the World]] 2009 survey.<ref name="frh">{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Combined Average Ratings: Independent Countries 2009 | work = | publisher = FreedomHouse.org| year =2009 | url = http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=475&year=2009| doi = | accessdate = 2010-01-17}}</ref>

The term of office began on 19 June 2006.<ref name="Un.org"/>

Foreign policy priorities of Azerbaijan include: first of all, the restoration of its territorial integrity; elimination of the consequences of the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh and seven other regions of Azerbaijan;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/comments.php?id=2886|title=Independence of Kosovo and the Nagorno-Karabakh Issue}}</ref> development of good-neighbourly and mutually advantageous relations with neighbouring countries; promotion of security and stability in the region; integration into European and Transatlantic security and cooperation structures; and promotion of transregional economic, energy and transportation projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.az/eng/foreign_policy/foreign_policy.shtml|title=MFA Foreign Policy Priorities}}</ref>

The Azeri Government, in late 2007, stated that the long-standing dispute over the Armenian-occupied territory of Nagorno-Karabakh is almost certain to spark a new war if it remains unresolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/11/27/europe/EU-GEN-Azerbaijan-Armenia-Karabakh.php|title=Azerbaijan defense minister warns territorial dispute could spark new war}}</ref> The Government is in the process of increasing its military budget, as its oil and gas revenues bring a torrent of cash into its coffers. Furthermore, economic sanctions by Turkey to the west and by Azerbaijan itself to the east have combined to greatly erode Armenia's economy, leading to steep increases in prices for basic commodities and a great decline in the Armenian state revenues.<ref>{{cite web|title=Armenia opposes Turkish-Azeri railway|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?ots591=4888caa0-b3db-1461-98b9-e20e7b9c13d4&lng=en&id=52072|publisher=ISN Zurich|accessdate=7 December 2010}}</ref>

Azerbaijan is an active member of international coalitions fighting international terrorism. The country is contributing to peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Azerbaijan is an active member of [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] program. It also maintains good relations with the [[European Union]] and could potentially one day apply for membership.

===Administrative divisions===

The National (now Central) Bank was created in 1992 based on the Azerbaijan State Savings Bank, an affiliate of the former State Savings Bank of the USSR. The Central Bank serves as Azerbaijan's central bank, empowered to issue the national currency, the [[Azerbaijani manat]], and to supervise all commercial banks. Two major commercial banks are the state-owned [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]] and the UniBank.

===Banking===
[[File:Azeri Square.JPG|thumb|left|The Central Bank building in downtown Baku.]]
The [[Economic growth|GDP growth rates]] observed in Azerbaijan during last years made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But the banking sector of Azerbaijan has yet to tap the vast growth potential that should be achievable due to the continuation of the high economic growth.<ref name="AZ bank report" /> For this reason the banking sector remains small in relation to the size of the [[Economy of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani economy]]. Although in the more [[advanced countries]] banking sectors made further visible progress in the catch-up process, the Azerbaijani banking market being in an earlier stage of development, also successes in pushing forward market-oriented reform and the [[privatization]] process.<ref name="AZ bank report">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-best-of-both-worlds.com/support-files/azerbaijan-banking-sector-2007.pdf |title=AZERBAIJANBANKING SYSTEM:AN OVERVIEW July 2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate= July 2007}}</ref> 

Still the banking system is considered an important element of financial system of Azerbaijan.

Since 2002 important stage of [[restructuring]] of banking system started to be carried out. Taking into consideration entry of big oil revenues in the country, as a logical result of successful oil strategy, and in this base, as the banks were ready to an effective transfer of their financial resources to the strategic goals, development strategy was made for 2002-2005. Far-reaching reforms of the banking sector are conducted in the country. The main challenges are due to the slow privatization rate of the state banks, a weak financial market and a lack of bank transparency. However, the reforms have started showing positive resu lts and competition among the leading banks is increasing.<ref name="AZ bank">{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =GlobalRating / AzeriRating looks at the state of and development trends in the banking sector in Azerbaijan: | work = | publisher = RusRating | date = | url = http://www.rusrating.ru/en/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=410&Itemid=31| doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> 

By April 1, 2010, 47 banks, 631 bank branches function in Azerbaijan. One of banks was founded with participation of state capital, 23 of foreign capital. To the same date, 98 non-bank credit organizations operate in the republic along with banks. Growth of real money incomes of population, development of trust in bank system, improving the legal bases of protection of interests of creditors and depositors, in particular launch of <U+2018>Deposits Insurance Fund<U+2019> were the criteria characterizing rapid growth of deposits of population.

Tourism is an important part of the [[economy of Azerbaijan]]. The country's large abundance of natural and cultural attractions make it an attractive destination of visitors. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s, yet, the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] during the 1990s crippled the tourist industry and damaged the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.<ref><U+0412><U+043B><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438> <U+0410><U+0437><U+0435><U+0440><U+0431><U+0430><U+0439><U+0434><U+0436><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430> <U+043E><U+0431><U+0435><U+0441><U+043F><U+043E><U+043A><U+043E><U+0435><U+043D><U+044B> <U+0441><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+044F><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435><U+043C> <U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0445> <U+043F><U+0430><U+043C><U+044F><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0432> <U+041D><U+0430><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C> <U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0445><U+0435> {{ru icon}}</ref>

The convenient location of Azerbaijan on the crossroad of major international traffic arteries, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the South-North corridor, highlights the strategic importance of transportation sector for the country<U+2019>s economy.

Azerbaijan is also an important economic hub in the transportation of raw materials. The [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline]] (BTC) became operational in May 2006 and extends more than {{convert|1774|km}} through the territories of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey. The BTC is designed to transport up to 50&nbsp;million tons of crude oil annually and carries oil from the Caspian Sea oilfields to global markets.  The [[South Caucasus Pipeline]], also stretching through the territory of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, became operational at the end of 2006 and offers additional gas supplies to the European market from the [[Shah Deniz gas field]].  Shah Deniz is expected to produce up to 296&nbsp;billion cubic metres of natural gas per year. Azerbaijan also plays a major role in the EU-sponsored [[Silk Road]] Project.

In 2002, the Azerbaijani government established the Ministry of Transport with a broad range of policy and regulatory functions. In the same year, the country became a member of the [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/CP_Vienna_convention.pdf|title= List of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Road Traffic|publisher = UN Economic Commission for Europe|author= |accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> The highest priority being; upgrading the transport network and transforming transportation services into one of the key comparative advantages of the country, as this would be highly conducive to the development of other sectors of the economy.

Government estimates say, in the future, profits from the [[information technology]] and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan aims for hi-tech state|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/11/26/azerbaijan-aims-for-hi-tech-state/|publisher=[[Euronews]]|accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref>

===Language===
{{Main|Azerbaijani language}}
[[File:Azerilanguage.png|thumb|Map showing locations of Azerbaijani speakers.]]
The official language is Azerbaijani, which belongs to the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[language family]], spoken in southwestern Asia, primarily in Azerbaijan and [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]]. Azerbaijani is member of the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] branch of the Turkic languages and is closely related to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Qashqai language|Qashqai]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]].

The Azerbaijani language is divided into two varieties, North Azerbaijani<ref>[[ISO 639-3]] azj [[silcode:azj|"Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: azj" SIL International]]</ref>  and South Azerbaijani,<ref>[[ISO 639-3]] azb [[silcode:azb|"Documentation for ISO 639 identifier: azb" SIL International]]</ref> and a large number of dialects.

Azerbaijani culture has developed as a result of many influences. Today, [[Western world|Western]] influences, including [[globalization|globalized]] [[consumer]] culture, are strong.

Azerbaijan folk consists of Azerbaijanis, the representative part of society, as well as of nations and ethnic groups, compactly living in various areas of the country. Azerbaijani national and traditional dresses are the [[Chokha]] and [[Papakhi]]. There are radio broadcasts in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lezgin language|Lezgin]] and [[Talysh language|Talysh]] languages, which are financed from the state budget.<ref name="MIN"/> Some local radio stations in [[Balak<U+0259>n|Balakan]] and [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]] organize broadcasts in [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat]].<ref name="MIN"/> In Baku several newspapers are published in Russian, Kurdish (''Dengi Kurd''), Lezgin (''Samur'') and Talysh languages.<ref name="MIN"/> Jewish society "Sokhnut" publishes the newspaper ''Aziz''.<ref name="MIN"/>

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Bahram gur01.jpg|thumb|The sculpture of [[Bahram V|Bahram Gur]] on Azneft Square.]]
Azerbaijani architecture typically combines elements of [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western culture|West]]. Many ancient architectural treasures such as the [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] and [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]] in the [[Baku|Walled City of Baku]] survive in modern Azerbaijan. Entries submitted on the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] tentative list include the [[Fire Temple of Baku]], the [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]] and the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]] in [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]].

Among other architectural treasures are [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Quadrangular Castle]] in [[Mardakan]], [[Parigala]] in [[Yuxar<U+0131> <U+00C7>ardaqlar|Yukhary Chardaglar]], a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the [[Baku Metro|Baku subway]]s are noted for their lavish decor.

===Cinematography===
{{Main|Cinema of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani animation|Television in Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Azerbaijani film 1898.jpg|thumb|left|A scene from [[The Oil Gush in Balakhany]] in 1898. One of the earliest films ever produced. Directed by the pioneer [[Alexander Mishon]].<ref>{{cite news |url= hhttp://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html|title=Cinema in Azerbaijan: Pre-Soviet Era|date=Autumn 1997|publisher="Azerbaijan International"|accessdate=Autumn 1997}}</ref>]]
The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in [[cinematography]]. Therefore It's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in [[Baku]] <U+2013> at the turn of the 19th century, this bay town on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.<ref name="cinemainazerbaijan">[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80] by Aydin Kazimzade. Azerbaijan International, Autumn 1997</ref>

In 1919, during the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], a documentary ''The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence'' was filmed on Azerbaijan's independence day, May 28, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku.

After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. This also influenced the creation of [[Azerbaijani animation]].

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming August 2 professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan.

Now that the USSR does not exist anymore, Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Azerbaijani cuisine}}
[[File:Sekerbura DSC3151.jpg|thumb|upright|Traditional Azerbaijani shakarbura.]]
[[Azerbaijani cuisine]], throughout the centuries, has been influenced by the foods of different cultures due to political and economic processes in Azerbaijan. Still, today's Azerbaijani cuisine has distinctive and unique features. Many foods that are indigenous to the country can now be seen in the cuisines of other cultures. For the Azerbaijanis, food is an important part of the country's culture and is deeply rooted in the history, traditions and values of the nation.

The traditional cuisine is famous for an abundance of vegetables and greens used seasonally in the dishes. Fresh herbs, including mint, cilantro (coriander), dill, basil, parsley, tarragon, leeks, chives, thyme, marjoram, green onion, and watercress, are very popular and often accompany main dishes on the table.

Climatic diversity and fertility of the land are reflected in the national dishes, which are based on fish from the [[Caspian Sea]], local meat (mainly mutton and beef), and an abundance of seasonal vegetables and greens. Saffron-rice [[plov]] is the flagship food in Azerbaijan and [[black tea]] is the national beverage.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century.

A relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects.<ref name="AZ study">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/azerbaijan/23.htm |title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study, Education, Health, and Welfare |format= |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the standard alphabet, from [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] to [[Roman alphabet|Roman]] in the 1920s and from Roman to [[Cyrillic]] in the 1930s. According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970.<ref name="AZ study" />

Since independence, one of the first laws that Azerbaijan's Parliament passed to disassociate itself from the Soviet Union was to adopt a [[Azerbaijani alphabet|modified-Latin alphabet]] to replace Cyrillic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/44_folder/44_articles/44_education.html |title=Education in Azerbaijan, The Challenges of Transition |format= |date= |accessdate= Winter 1996}}</ref> Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural change. Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of [[preschool]]s, general [[secondary schools]], and [[vocational schools]], including specialized secondary schools and technical schools.

Sport in Azerbaijan has ancient roots, and even now, both traditional and modern sports are still practiced. [[Freestyle wrestling]] has been traditionally regarded as Azerbaijan's [[national sport]], however today, the most popular sports in Azerbaijan are [[association football|football]] and [[chess]]. The [[Azerbaijan national football team|national football team]] of Azerbaijan demonstrates relatively low performance in the international arena compared to the nation football clubs. It is mainly because of the foreign footballers playing in the clubs. However, the newly opened [[Azerbaijan Football Academy]] in February 2009 is a huge step in the development of the youth football.<ref>[http://www.football-plus.az/view_post.php?id=163 Az<U+0259>rbaycanda ilk futbol akademiyas<U+0131> istifad<U+0259>y<U+0259> verildi]{{az icon}}</ref> The most successful Azerbaijani football clubs are [[Neftchi Baku]], [[FK Baku]], [[Inter Baku]], [[FK Qaraba<U+011F>|FK Karabakh]] and [[Khazar Lankaran]].
