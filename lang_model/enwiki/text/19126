==Etymology and definitions==
The idea that a part of the Americas has a cultural affinity with the Romance cultures as a whole can be traced back to the 1830s, in particular in the writing of the [[France|French]] [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] [[Michel Chevalier]], who postulated that this part of the Americas were inhabited by people of a "[[Latins#Modern uses|Latin race]]," and that it could, therefore, ally itself with "[[Latin Europe]]" in a struggle with "[[Germanic Europe|Teutonic Europe]]," "[[Anglo-America|Anglo-Saxon America]]" and "[[Slavic Europe]]."<ref name = "mignolo">{{cite book | last = Mignolo | first = Walter | title = The Idea of Latin America | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=vPacXtsWhewC | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | place = Oxford | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781405100861 |pages = 77<U+2013>80}}</ref> The idea was later taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid- and late-nineteenth century, who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models, but rather to France.<ref>McGuiness, Aims (2003).

In contemporary usage:
* In one sense, ''Latin America'' refers to those territories in the Americas where the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] languages prevail: [[Mexico]], most of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and (in the [[Caribbean]]) [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Puerto Rico]] <U+2014> in summary, [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] and [[Brazil]].

* Also, particularly in the [[United States]], the term more broadly refers to ''all'' of the Americas south of the United States; thus, [[Anglo-America|English-speaking countries]] such as [[Belize]], [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Guyana]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[St. Lucia]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[the Bahamas]], as well as [[Haiti]] and [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[French Guiana]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], [[Aruba]] and [[Suriname]] are included.

*In a more literal definition, which remains faithful to the original usage, ''Latin America'' designates all of those countries and territories in the [[Americas]] where a [[Romance language]] (i.e., languages derived from [[Latin]], and hence the name of the region) is spoken: Spanish, Portuguese, and [[French language|French]], and the [[creole language]]s based upon these. Although French-influenced areas of the Americas would include [[Quebec]], this region is rarely considered to be part of ''Latin America'', since its history, distinctively North American culture and economy, and British-inspired political institutions are generally deemed too closely intertwined with the rest of Canada.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bethell | first = Leslie (ed.) | title = The Cambridge History of Latin America | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1984 | volume = 1 | location = Cambridge | page = xiv | isbn = 0-521-23223-6 }}</ref>

The distinction between ''Latin America'' and ''[[Anglo-America]]'' (or, in some uses, ''[[North America]]''), which can be criticized for stressing only the European heritage of these regions (that is, for [[Eurocentrism]]), is a convention based on the predominant languages in the Americas by which Romance-language and English-speaking cultures are distinguished. Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogenous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Paraguay]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of [[Africa]]n cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin<U+2014>including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]])<U+2014>and the coastal areas of [[Ecuador]] and [[Brazil]].

==Subdivisions==
[[image:Darcyamerica.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Darcy Ribeiro]] has proposed a classification between <U+201C>witness peoples (yellow)<U+201D> (Mexico, Guatemala, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador), <U+201C>New peoples (Red)<U+201D> (Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia, Caribbean nations, Chile and Paraguay) and <U+201C>transplanted peoples(Blue)<U+201D> (Uruguay and Argentina).<ref>[http://books.google.com.pe/books?id=grvnsgM0nDcC&pg=PA3&dq=Darcy+Ribeiro+classification+of+Latin+American#v=onepage&q=Darcy%20Ribeiro%20classification%20of%20Latin%20American&f=false Identity and modernity in Latin America By  Jorge Larra<U+00ED>n (page 3)]</ref>]]
Latin America can be subdivided into several subregions based on geography, politics, demographics and culture; some subregions are [[North America]], [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], the [[Southern Cone]], and [[Andean states]]. In terms of culture, society and national identity [[Mario Sambarino]] classified Latin American states into [[Mestizo]]-American [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]] etc.), [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]]-America (Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru) and European-American (Argentina and Uruguay).<ref name=Larrain>Larra<U+00ED>n, Jorge. ''Identidad chilena. 2001. Editorial LOM.</ref>

In [[Darcy Ribeiro]]'s classification system Latin American countries are classified as "New Peoples" (Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil etc.), that merged from the mix of several cultures while Peru, Bolivia and Mexico are "Testimony Peoples", remnants of ancient civilizations and Argentina and Uruguay, former "New Peoples" that became "Transplantated Peoples", essentially European, after massive immigration.<ref name=Larrain/> Under this scheme, the people of the Brazilian Amazon could be regarded as being just as much "Testimony Peoples" as those of the Peruvian Amazon, and the people of the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul could equally be seen as "Translplanted", just like those of the very similar cultures of neighboring Uruguay and Argentina.

===Pre-columbian history===
[[File:Machu Picchu.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A view of [[Machu Picchu]], a pre-Columbian [[Inca]] site in [[Peru]].]]
The [[Americas]] were thought to have been first inhabited by people crossing the [[Bering Land Bridge]], now known as the [[Bering Strait|Bering]] [[strait]], from northeast [[Asia]] into [[Alaska]] well over 10,000 years ago. The earliest known settlement, however, was identified at Monte Verde, near Puerto Montt in Southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is some disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continents. By the first millennium [[AD]]/[[Common Era|CE]], South America<U+2019>s vast rainforests, mountains, plains and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} from about 8000 BC and 4600 BC, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibchas]] (or "Muiscas" or "Muyscas") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum carribean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and  [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] and [[Per<U+00FA>]] were the three Indian groups that settled most permanently.

The region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Caribs]], [[Tupi people|Tupi]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until it's downfall caused by the Spanish invasion.

===European colonization===

[[File:Chichen-Itza El Castillo.jpg|225px|left|thumb|Archaeological site of [[Chich<U+00E9>n-Itz<U+00E1>]] in [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]], [[Mexico]]. One of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World]].]]

With the arrival of the Europeans following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, lost power to the heavy European invasion. [[Hern<U+00E1>ndo Cort<U+00E9>s]] seized the Aztec elite's power with the help of local groups who did not favor the Aztec elite, and [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Western South America. The European powers of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] colonized the region, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world was divided into areas of Spanish and Portuguese control by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1493, which gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century, Europeans occupied large areas of North, Central and South America, extending from present-day southern [[Oregon]] in the [[United States]] through the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. European culture, customs and government were introduced, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming the major economic and political power to overrule the traditional ways of the region, eventually becoming the only official religion of the Americas during this period. 

Diseases brought by the Europeans, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large proportion of the indigenous population, with epidemics of diseases reducing them sharply from their prior populations. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. <!--It is often believed that a strong percentage of civilizations such as the [[Aztecs]], resigned to life rather than living with the new unbearable illnesses, and were not conquered by the Spaniards.--><!--what? needs clarification--> Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines. [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and the European colonists was very common, and, by the end of the [[colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.

===Independence (1810-1825)===
[[File:Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Simon Bolivar, one of the main Independence movement leaders]]
By the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. In Latin America resentment grew among the majority of the population over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political [[institution]]s. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the [[United States]] and the oldest independent nation in Latin America, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Martin]], and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.

Fighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1812, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in [[Mexico]] and [[Francisco de Miranda]] in [[Venezuela]]. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as  [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]] of Venezuela, [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Martin]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. [[Brazil]] achieved independence with a constitutional monarchy established in 1822. In the same year in [[Mexico]], a military officer, [[Agust<U+00ED>n de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as [[emperor]]. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived and was followed by the creation of a [[republic]] in 1823.

===World wars (1914-1945)===
{{Expand-section|date=December 2009}}

===Cold war (1946-1990)===
In the 1950s, the [[Cold War]] moved close to the [[United States]], in Latin America. The nations of Latin America faced many critical problems, including widespread [[poverty]] and poor health care. The [[United States]] feared the politics of socialism and communism would be particularly appealing to the countries of Latin America. At the same time, many United States citizens worried about the threat to their own security and businesses in Latin America.  This led the United States to take up a very aggressive military strategy of [[containment]]. Through the Cold War, the United States removed many democratically elected leaders of Latin American countries through covert C.I.A. operations and replaced them with leaders who were more friendly to the United States' interests.

Arguably, this interference with the democratic system in these countries created a [[blowback]] because many Latin Americans rejected the United States involvement. Many of the leaders who were put into power positions by the United States became dictators and oppressors as well.

===Late 20th century military regimes===
[[File:Pinochet y Videla.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Military dictators [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] of Argentina and [[Augusto Pinochet]] of Chile.]]

By the 1970s leftists had acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country's upper class to support coup d'etats to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by [[military dictatorship]]s.

Around the 1970s, these regimes collaborated in [[Operation Condor]] killing many [[leftist]] dissidents, including some [[urban guerrilla]]s.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.el-universal.com.mx/editoriales/34023.html | author = Victor Flores Olea | title = Editoriales - El Universal - 10 de abril 2006 : Operacion Condor | publisher = [[El Universal (Mexico)]] | accessdate = 2009-03-24 | (in spanish) }}</ref>
However, by the early 90's all countries had restored their democracies.

===Washington Consensus===
{{Main|Washington Consensus}}
The set of  specific economic policy prescriptions that were considered the "standard" reform package were promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, DC-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], and the [[US Treasury Department]] during the 80's and 90's.

In recent years, several Latin American countries led by socialist or other left wing governments<U+2014>including Argentina and Venezuela<U+2014>have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus set of policies. (Other Latin counties with governments of the left, including Brazil, Chile and Peru, have in practise adopted the bulk of the policies). Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the "fundamentalist" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a "one size fits all" treatment of individual economies.
The term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.

===Turn to the left===
[[Image:Unasul 29.jpg|thumb|right|165px|Left-leaning leaders of Bolivia, Brazil and Chile at the [[Union of South American Nations]] summit in 2008.]]
Since the 2000s, or 1990s in some countries, left-wing political parties have risen to power. The rise of [[Hugo Chavez]] in Venezuela, [[Lula da Silva]] in Brazil, [[Fernando Lugo]] in Paraguay, [[N<U+00E9>stor Kirchner|N<U+00E9>stor]] and [[Cristina Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Kirchner]] in Argentina, [[Tabar<U+00E9> V<U+00E1>zquez]] and recently elected [[Jos<U+00E9> Mujica]] in Uruguay, the [[Ricardo Lagos|Lagos]] and [[Michelle Bachelet|Bachelet]] governments in Chile, [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua, [[Manuel Zelaya]] in Honduras (although deposed by the [[2009 Honduran coup d'<U+00E9>tat|28 June 2009 ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'']]), and [[Rafael Correa]] of Ecuador are all part of this wave of left-wing politicians who also often declare themselves [[Socialism|socialists]], Latin Americanists or [[Anti-Imperialism|anti-imperialists]].

==Demographics==
===Ethnic groups===
The population of Latin America is a composite of ancestries, ethnic groups, and races, making the region one of the most diverse in the world. The specific composition varies from country to country: Many have a predominance of a European-Indian, or [[Mestizo]], population; in others, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] are a majority; some are dominated by inhabitants of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] ancestry; and some countries' populations are primarily [[Mulatto]]. Most Latin American countries have varying sizes of [[Asian people|Asian]] minorities. Europeans are the largest single group, and they and people of part-European ancestry combine for approximately 80% of the population.<ref name="CIAEG"/> In addition to the following groups, Latin America also has millions of tri-racial people of African, Amerindian, and European ancestry. Most are found in Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil, with a much smaller presence in a number of other countries. The concept of race and ethnicity in Latin America varies greatly from country to country, and in many places, when a Latin America speaks of "race", they are referring to what an Anglo-American would call nationality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

*'''Amerindians'''. The aboriginal population of Latin America, the Amerindians, arrived in [[Paleolithic]] times. In post-Columbian times they experienced tremendous population decline, particularly in the early decades of colonization. They have since recovered in numbers, surpassing sixty million (by some estimates), though they compose a majority only in [[Bolivia]] and [[Guatemala]], and per some sources in [[Peru]], as well. In [[Ecuador]] Amerindians are a large minority that comprises two-fifths of the population. Mexico's 13% is the next largest ratio, and this community is actually the largest Amerindian population in Latin America. Most of the remaining countries have Amerindian minorities, in every case making up less than one-tenth of the total population. In many countries, people of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry make up the majority of the population (see [[Mestizo]]).
*'''Asians'''. People of [[Asian Latin American|Asian descent]] number several million in Latin America. The first Asians to settle in the region were [[Filipino people|Filipino]], as a result of Spain's trade involving Asia and the Americas. The majority of Asian Latin Americans are of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] or [[Chinese people|Chinese]] ancestry and reside mainly in [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]]; there is also a growing [[Ethnic Chinese in Panama|Chinese minority in Panama]].

*'''Blacks'''. Millions of African [[slave]]s were brought to Latin America from the sixteenth century onward, the majority of whom were sent to the [[Caribbean]] region and [[Brazil]]. Today, people identified as "Black" are most numerous in Brazil (more than 10 million), and in relative terms in Puerto Rico (15%). Significant populations are also found in [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], Ecuador, [[Panama]], Colombia, and [[Venezuela]]. Latin Americans of mixed Black and White ancestry, called Mulattoes, are more numerous than Blacks.
*'''Mestizos'''. Intermixing between Europeans and Amerindians began early in the colonial period and was extensive. The resulting people, known as [[mestizo]]s, make up the majority of the population in half of the countries of Latin America. Additionally, mestizos compose large minorities in nearly all the other mainland countries.
*'''Mulattoes'''. [[Mulatto]]es are people of mixed European and African ancestry, mostly descended from Spanish or Portuguese settlers on one side and African slaves on the other during the colonial period. Brazil is home to Latin America's largest mulatto population. Mulattoes form a majority of population in the Dominican Republic and Cuba, and are also numerous in Venezuela, Panama, Peru, Colombia, and Puerto Rico, and Ecuador. Smaller populations of mulattoes are found in other Latin American countries.<ref name=CIAEG/>

*'''Whites'''. Beginning in the late fifteenth century, large numbers of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] colonists settled in what became Latin America (Portuguese in [[Brazil]] and Spaniards elsewhere in the region), and at present most white Latin Americans are of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese origin]]. Iberians brought the Spanish and Portuguese languages, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith, and many Iberian traditions. [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]] contain the largest numbers of whites in Latin America. Whites make up the majorities of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Uruguay]], and depending on source, in [[Cuba]], also.<ref name=Lizcano/><ref>[http://www.iidh.ed.cr/comunidades/diversidades/docs/div_docpublicaciones/Derecho%20Indigena Cap.%202.%20Pensar%20a%20los%20indios,%20tarea%20de%20criollos.pdf massive immigration of European Argentina Uruguay Chile Brazil]</ref><ref>[http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI8383110228A.PDF Latinoamerican.]</ref> Of the millions of immigrants since most of Latin America gained independence in the 1810s<U+2013>1820s, [[Italians]] formed the largest group, and next were [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-41807/South-America |title=South America :: Postindependence overseas immigrants |accessdate=2008-02-10 |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia}}</ref> Many others arrived, such as [[French people|French]], [[Germans]], [[Greeks]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Estonians]], [[Latvians]], [[Jew]]s, [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]]. Also included are [[Middle East]]erners of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian people|Syrian]], and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] descent. Most of them are Christian. Whites presently compose the largest racial group in Latin America (36% in the table herein), and, whether as White, Mulatto, or Mestizo, most Latin Americans have white ancestry. 

*'''Zambos''': Intermixing between Africans and Amerindians was especially prevalent in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Brazil]], often due to slaves's running away (becoming [[Maroon (people)|''cimarrones'']]: maroons) and being taken in by Amerindian villagers. People of this mixed ancestry are known as [[Zambo]]s or (in Central America) [[Garinagu]] in Spanish speaking nations, and [[Cafuso]]s in Brazil.

===Language===
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are the predominant languages of Latin America. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is spoken only in Brazil, the most populous country in the region. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language of most of the rest of the countries on the Latin American mainland, as well as in [[Puerto Rico]] (where it is co-official with English), [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[French language|French]] is spoken in some [[Caribbean]] islands, including [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], and [[Haiti]], as well as in the overseas departments of [[French Guiana]] (South America) and in [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (North America). [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of some Caribbean islands and in [[Suriname]] on the continent; however, as Dutch is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], these territories are not considered part of Latin America.

Other European languages spoken in Latin America include: [[English language|English]], by some groups in [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], and [[Puerto Rico]], as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]] (English is used as a major foreign language in Latin American commerce and education); [[German language|German]], in southern [[Brazil]], southern [[Chile]], Argentina, portions of northern [[Venezuela]], and Paraguay; [[Italian language|Italian]], in Brazil, Argentina, [[Uruguay]], and Venezuela; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh inmigration to Patagonia]</ref><ref>[http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh inmigration to Patagonia]</ref><ref>[http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh inmigration to Patagonia]</ref><ref>[http://www.patagonline.com/gaiman-trelew Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh inmigration to Patagonia]</ref><ref>[http://www.andesceltig.com/ Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh inmigration to Patagonia]</ref><ref>[http://www.glaniad.com/ Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh inmigration to Patagonia]</ref>, in southern Argentina.
[[File:Map-Most Widely Spoken Native Languages in Latin America.png|thumb|left|230px|Most widely spoken Pre-contact languages distribution area in Latin America, at the beginning of 21st century: '''<font color="#0000FF">Quechua</font>''', '''<font color="#f9dc38">Guarani</font>''', '''<font color="#ff9922">Aymara</font>''', '''<font color="#cc0000">Nahuatl</font>''', '''<font color="#006600">Mayan languages</font>''', '''<font color="#000000">Mapuche''']]
In several nations, especially in the [[Caribbean]] region, [[creole languages]] are spoken. The most widely spoken creole language in the Caribbean and Latin America in general is [[Haitian Creole]], the predominant language of [[Haiti]]; it is derived primarily from French and certain [[West Africa]]n tongues with some [[Amerindian]] and Spanish influences as well. Creole languages of mainland Latin America, similarly, are derived from European languages and various African tongues. [[Native American languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Chile]]. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages is small or non-existent.

In [[Peru]], [[Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. Another widely used language is known as riverian which is also known as nicolacian, which is spoken in rural parts of Mexico<ref name="bob'sjourneytothecenteroftheearth.html">{{ cite web |url=https://www.bob'sjourneytothecenteroftheearth.html |title=8=D.}}</ref>
.In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara]], Quechua and Guaran<U+00ED> hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaran<U+00ED> language|Guarani]] is, along with Spanish, an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo language|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as "national languages" along with Spanish.

===Crime and violence===
{{See also|Crime and Violence in Latin America}}

Crime and violence prevention and public security are now important issues for governments and citizens in Latin America and the Caribbean region. In 2004, violence was the main cause of death in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[El Salvador]], [[Mexico]] and [[Honduras]].<ref>[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/0,,contentMDK:20568491~menuPK:258569~pagePK:2865106~piPK:2865128~theSitePK:258554,00.html] Viva Rio: Innovative Approaches Against Urban Crime</ref><ref>[http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/voices_from_the_field/story.php?StoryID=613] UN: Latin America: Making Cities Safer</ref> Homicide rates in Latin America are among the highest in the world. From the early 1980s through the mid-1990s, [[homicide]] rates increased by 50 percent. The major victims of such homicides are young men, 69 percent of whom are between the ages of 15 and 19 years old. Many analysts agree that the prison crisis will not be resolved until the gap between rich and poor is addressed. They say that growing [[social inequality]] is fuelling crime in the region. But there is also no doubt that, on such an approach, Latin American countries have still a long way to go.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4404176.stm BBC NEWS | Americas | Latin America: Crisis behind bars<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Countries with the highest [[homicide]] rate per year per 100,000 inhabitants  were; [[Guatemala]] 57.9, [[El Salvador]] 49.1, [[Venezuela]] 48, [[Honduras]] 59, [[Colombia]] 33, [[Belize]] 30.8, [[Brazil]] 25.7, [[Dominican Republic]] 23.56, [[Puerto Rico]] 18.8, [[Ecuador]] 16.9, and .

==Economy==
===Standard of living, consumption, and the environment===
According to [[Goldman Sachs]] [[BRIMC]] review of emerging economies, by 2050 the largest economies in the world will be as follows: [[China]], [[USA]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], and [[Brazil]]; Two of the largest five economies in the world are Latin American.<ref>[http://www.chicagogsb.edu/alumni/clubs/pakistan/docs/next11dream-march%20%2707-goldmansachs.pdf]</ref> More significant is that on a per capita basis most Latin American countries, including all the large countries (Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Venezuela and Colombia), have per capita GDPs greater than that of China in 2009, while some of this group are substantially more developed than China.

The following table lists all the countries in Latin America indicating a valuation of the country's GDP ([[Gross domestic product]]) based on purchasing-power-parity ([[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]), GDP per capita also adjusted to the (PPP), a measurement of inequality through the [[Gini index]] (the higher the index the more unequal the income distribution is), the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), the [[Environmental Performance Index]] (EPI), and the [[Quality-of-life index]]. GDP and PPP GDP statistics come from the [[International Monetary Fund]] with data as of 2006. Gini index, the [[Human Poverty Index]] HDI-1, the [[Human Development Index]], and the number of internet users per capita come from the [[UN Development Program]]. The number of motor vehicles per capita come from the UNData base on-line. The EPI index comes from the [[Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy]] and the [[Quality-of-life index]] from [[The Economist]] Intelligence Unit. Green cells indicate the 1st rank in each category, while yellow indicate the last rank.

===Inequality and poverty===
Inequality and poverty continue to be the region's main challenges; according to the [[ECLAC]] Latin America is the most unequal region in the world.<ref>[http://www.americaeconomia.com/PLT_WRITE-PAGE~SessionId~~Language~0~Modality~0~Section~1~Content~28026~NamePage~NoticiasArti~DateView~~Style~15389.htm La regi<U+00F3>n sigue siendo la m<U+00E1>s desigual del mundo, seg<U+00FA>n Cepal] Am<U+00E9>rica Econom<U+00ED>a</ref> Moreover, according to the World Bank, nearly 25% of the population lives on less than 2 USD a day. The countries with the highest inequality in the region (as measured with the [[Gini index]] in the UN Development Report<ref name="Gini"/>) in 2006 were [[Bolivia]] (60.1), [[Haiti]] (59.2), [[Colombia]] (58.6), [[Paraguay]] (58.4), [[Brazil]] (57.0) and [[Panama]] (56.1), while the countries with the lowest inequality in the region were [[Nicaragua]] (43.1),  [[Uruguay]] (44.9) and [[Mexico]] (46.1). One aspect of inequality and poverty in Latin America is unequal access to basic infrastructure. For example, access to [[water and sanitation in Latin America]] and the quality of these services remain relatively low.

According to the [[World Bank]] the poorest countries in the region were (as of 2008):<ref>http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DATASTATISTICS/Resources/GNIPC.pdf</ref> [[Haiti]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Honduras]]. [[Undernourishment]] affects to 47% of [[Haiti]]ans, 27% of [[Nicaraguans]], 23% of [[Bolivia]]ns and 22% of [[Hondurans]].<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_suffering_from_undernourishment</ref>

===Trade blocs===
The major trade blocs (or agreements) in the region are the [[Union of South American Nations]], composed of the integrated [[Mercosur]] and [[Andean Community of Nations]] ('''CAN'''). Minor blocs or trade agreements are the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Dominican Republic <U+2013> Central America Free Trade Agreement]] ('''DR-CAFTA''') and the [[Caribbean Community]] ('''CARICOM'''). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Brazilian and Paraguayan legislatures). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise. On the other hand, Mexico is a member of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ('''NAFTA'''). [[Chile]] has already signed an FTA with [[Canada]], and along with [[Peru]] are the only two South American nations that have an FTA with the [[United States]]. [[Colombia]]'s government is currently awaiting its ratification by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

===Largest economic cities===
The following table provides GDP figures for the largest Latin American cities and their surrounding urban areas in 2005. The only perspective of change in the GDP values by 2020 is between [[Bogota]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], GDP figures are estimated and expressed in USD, using purchasing power parity exchange rates:<ref name="pwc">{{cite web|url=http://www.ukmediacentre.pwc.com/imagelibrary/downloadMedia.asp?MediaDetailsID=863|title="Table 1.2&nbsp;<U+2013> Top 30 urban agglomeration GDP rankings in 2005 and illustrative projections to 2020 (using UN definitions and population estimates)"|first="UK Economic Outlook, March 2007", page 5|last=[[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]]|format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref><ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/richest-cities-2005.html 150 Richest Cities in the World, 2005]</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Latin American culture}}

Latin American culture is a mixture of many cultural expressions worldwide. It is the product of many diverse influences:

[[Image:Teatro Teresa Carre<U+00F1>o.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Teresa Carre<U+00F1>o Cultural Complex in [[Caracas]].]]

* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to the arrival of the Europeans. Ancient and very advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]], the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca civilization|Incas]] are examples of these.
*[[Western culture|Western civilization]], in particular the [[culture of Europe]], was brought mainly by the colonial powers<U+2014>the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[French people|French]]<U+2014>between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influence is language and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. More recently, additional cultural influences came from the [[United States]] and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the later. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is a United States territory. In addition, the United States held the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. [[South America]] experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially [[Italian people|Italians]] and [[German people|Germans]]. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], [[science]] and [[medicine]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Stepan| first = Nancy Leys | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = "The Hour of Eugenics": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America | publisher = Cornell University Press | year = 1991 | location = Ithaca | pages = in passim | nopp = true | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8014-9795-7 }}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics.
* [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], whose presence derives from a long history of [[Atlantic slave trade|New World slavery]]. Peoples of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean. This is manifest for instance in dance and religion, especially in countries such as [[Belize]], Brazil, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.

Beyond the rich tradition of indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italian Masters. In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin-Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.

From the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the Constructivist Movement. The Constructivist Movement was founded in [[Russia]] around 1913 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]]. The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America. [[Joaquin Torres Garcia]] and [[Manuel Rend<U+00F3>n]] have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement into Latin America from Europe.

An important artistic movement generated in Latin America is ''[[muralism]]'' represented by [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Clemente Orozco]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] in Mexico and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and [[Pedro Nel G<U+00F3>mez]] in Colombia. Some of the most impressive ''Muralista'' works can be found in [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Philadelphia]].

Painter [[Frida Kahlo]], one of the most famous Mexican artists, painted about her own life and the Mexican culture in a style combining [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Surrealism]]. Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings.<ref>{{cite web | title=Frida Kahlo " Roots " Sets $5.6 Million Record at Sotheby's | url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/Frida_Kahlo_Roots_$5.6_Million_Record-at-Sothebys.html | publisher=Art Knowledge News |accessdate=2007-09-23}}</ref>

Colombian [[sculptor]] and painter [[Fernando Botero]] is also widely known by his works which, on first examination, are noted for their exaggerated proportions and the corpulence of the human and animal figures.

===Film===
{{Main|Latin American cinema}}
Latin American film is both rich and diverse. Historically, the main centers of production have been M<U+00E9>xico, Brazil, Cuba, and Argentina.

[[File:Historia Oficial.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Official Story]]]]

Latin American cinema flourished after the introduction of sound, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border. The 1950s and 1960s saw a movement towards [[Third Cinema]], led by the Argentine filmmakers [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]]. More recently, a new style of directing and stories filmed has been tagged as "New Latin American Cinema."

[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci<U+00F3>n Nacional|1976<U+2013>1983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004) and ''[[El otro]]'' (2007).

[[Image:Amores perros poster.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Amores perros]]'' (2000) a film directed by [[Alejandro Gonz<U+00E1>lez I<U+00F1><U+00E1>rritu]].]]

[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2003) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).

[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the Cuban revolution and important film-makers include [[Tom<U+00E1>s Guti<U+00E9>rrez Alea]].

[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Hollywood]] at the time. Stars included [[Mar<U+00ED>a F<U+00E9>lix]], [[Dolores del Rio]] and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mam<U+00E1> tambi<U+00E9>n]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuar<U+00F3>n]] and [[Alejandro Gonz<U+00E1>lez I<U+00F1>arritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro Gonz<U+00E1>lez I<U+00F1><U+00E1>rritu directed in (2006) [[Babel (film)|Babel]] and Alfonso Cuar<U+00F3>n directed ([[Children of Men]] in (2006), and [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]] in (2004)). [[Guillermo del Toro]] close friend and also a front rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed [[Pan's Labyrinth]] (2006) and produce [[The Orphanage (film)|El Orfanato]] (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] ([[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]]), and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico directed by [[Carlos Cuar<U+00F3>n]].

It is also worth noting that many Latin Americans have achieved significant success within Hollywood, for instance [[Carmen Miranda]] and [[Salma Hayek]], while [[Mexican Americans]] such as [[Robert Rodriguez]] have also made their mark.

===Literature===
{{Main|Latin American literature}}
{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}

[[File:Gabogarciamarquez1.png|thumb|left|250px|Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]] signing a copy of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].]]

Pre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quich<U+00E9> (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.

From the very moment of Europe's "discovery" of the continent, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and cr<U+00F3>nicas of their experience<U+2014>such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal D<U+00ED>az del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana In<U+00E9>s de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).

[[File:Neruda 1971.jpg|thumb|right|145px|Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]], interviewed in 1971.]]
The 19th Century was a period of "foundational fictions" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of "civilization or barbarism" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan Le<U+00F3>n Mera]]'s ''Cumand<U+00E1>'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sert<U+00F5>es]]'' (1902)).

At the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rub<U+00E9>n Dar<U+00ED>o]]'s ''[[Azul]]'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[Jos<U+00E9> Mart<U+00ED>]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the U.S. and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.

[[File:Carlos Fuentes.jpg|thumb|132px|left|Mexican writer [[Carlos Fuentes]]]]

However, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cort<U+00E1>zar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort<U+00E1>zar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]]'s [[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien a<U+00F1>os de soledad]] (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.

[[File:Borges 001.JPG|thumb|right|145px|Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]].]]
Contemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bola<U+00F1>o]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Testimony in literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Mench<U+00FA>]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiv<U+00E1>is]] and Pedro Lemebel.

The region boasts five [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc<U+00ED>a M<U+00E1>rquez]] (1982), the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel <U+00C1>ngel Asturias]] (1967), and the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990).

===Music and dance===
{{See also|Dance and music of Latin America || Latin American music|Latin pop|Latin dance}}

[[File:Salsa, Sabor, Cali.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing]]

Latin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales. The most successful have been [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] who has sold over 100 million records, [[Carlos Santana]] with over 75 million, [[Luis Miguel]], [[Shakira]] and [[Vicente Fern<U+00E1>ndez|Vicente Fernandez]] with over 50 million records sold worldwide.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_music_artists</ref> One of the main characteristics of Latin American music is its diversity, from the lively rhythms of Central America and the Caribbean to the more austere sounds of the Andes and the [[Southern Cone]]. Another feature of Latin American music is its original blending of the variety of styles that arrived in The Americas and became influential, from the early Spanish and European Baroque to the different beats of the African rhythms.

Caribbean Hispanic music, such as [[Merengue (music)|merengue]], [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], and more recently [[reggaeton]], from such countries as the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico,Trinidad, Cuba, and Panama has been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies. Haiti's [[Kompa|compas]] is a genre of music that draws influence and is thus similar to its Caribbean Hispanic counterparts, with an element of jazz and modern sound as well.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dr. Christopher Washburne |publisher=University of Salsa |title=Clave: The African Roots of Salsa |accessdate=2006-05-23 |url=http://www.planetsalsa.com/university_of_salsa/clave/clave_roots.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher=Caravan Music |title=Guide to Latin Music |url=http://www.caravanmusic.com/GuideLatinMusic.htm |accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref>

Another well-known Latin American musical genre includes the [[Argentine tango|Argentine]] and [[Uruguayan tango|Uruguayan]] [[tango music|tango]], as well as the distinct [[nuevo tango]], a fusion of tango, [[acoustic music|acoustic]] and [[electronic music]] popularized by [[bandone<U+00F3>n]] virtuoso [[<U+00C1>stor Piazzolla]]. Equally renown, the [[samba]], North American [[jazz]], [[European classical music]] and [[choro]] combined to form ''[[bossa nova]]'' in Brazil, popularized by [[guitar]]rist [[Jo<U+00E3>o Gilberto]] and [[jazz piano|pianist]] [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]].

Other influential Latin American sounds include the Antillean [[Soca music|Soca]] and [[Calypso music|Calypso]], the Honduras (Garifuna) [[Punta]], the Colombian [[cumbia]] and [[vallenato]], the Chilean [[Cueca]], the Ecuadorian [[Boleros music|Boleros]], and [[Rockoleras]], the Mexican [[ranchera]], the Nicaraguan [[Palo de Mayo]], the Peruvian [[Marinera]] and [[Tondero]], the Uruguayan [[Candombe]], the French Antillean [[Zouk]] (Derived from Haitian Compas) and the various styles of music from Pre-Columbian traditions that are widespread in the [[Andean]] region.

[[File:Tango-Show-Buenos-Aires-01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A couple dances [[Culture of Argentina|Argentine]] [[Tango (dance)|Tango]].]]
The classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] (1887<U+2013>1959) worked on the recording of native musical traditions within his homeland of Brazil. The traditions of his homeland heavily influenced his classical works.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Leadership Medica |title=Heitor Villa-Lobos |accessdate=2006-05-23|url=http://www.cesil.com/0998/enbass09.htm}}</ref> Also notable is the recent work of the Cuban [[Leo Brouwer]] and guitar work of the Venezuelan [[Antonio Lauro]] and the Paraguayan [[Agust<U+00ED>n Barrios]]. Latin America has also produced world-class classical performers such as the Chilean pianist [[Claudio Arrau]], Brazilian pianist [[Nelson Freire]] and the Argentine pianist and conductor [[Daniel Barenboim]].

Arguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as [[Yma S<U+00FA>mac]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[Victor Jara]], [[Mercedes Sosa]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Luiz Gonzaga]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Susana Baca]], [[Chavela Vargas]], [[Simon Diaz]], [[Julio Jaramillo]], [[Toto la Momposina]] as well as musical ensembles such as [[Inti Illimani]] and [[Los Kjarkas]] are magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach.

[[Latin pop]], including many forms of [[Rock (music)|rock]], is popular in Latin America today (see [[Spanish language rock and roll]]).<ref>{{cite news |author=The Baltimore Sun |publisher=The Michigan Daily |title=Latin music returns to America with wave of new pop starlets |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/sep/09-28-99/arts/arts6.html |accessdate=2006-05-23}}</ref>

More recently, [[Reggaeton]], which blends Jamaican reggae and dancehall with Latin America genres such as [[bomba]] and [[plena]], as well as that of [[hip hop]], is becoming more popular, in spite of the controversy surrounding its lyrics, dance steps ([[Perreo]]) and music videos. It has become very popular among populations with a "migrant culture" influence&nbsp;<U+2013> both Latino populations in the U.S., such as southern Florida and New York City, and parts of Latin America where migration to the U.S. is common, such as Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Mexico.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Associated Press |title=Daddy Yankee leads the reggaeton charge |accessdate=2006-05-23 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9410287/from/RL.3/}}</ref>
