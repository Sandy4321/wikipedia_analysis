The '''Drownings at Nantes''' ({{lang-fr|Noyades de Nantes}}) were a series of [[democide|mass executions]] by [[drowning]] during the [[Reign of Terror]] in [[Nantes]], France, that occurred between November 1793 and February 1794. During this period, anyone arrested and jailed for not consistently supporting the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], or suspected of being a [[Louis XVI|royalist]] sympathizer, especially [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priests]] and [[nun]]s, was cast into the [[Loire River|Loire]] and drowned on the orders of [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]], the [[representative-on-mission]] in Nantes. Before the horrific murders ceased, as many as four thousand or more people, including innocent families with women and children, lost their lives in what Carrier himself called "the national bathtub."<ref name=Loomis289>{{Cite book |title=Paris in the Terror |last=Loomis |first=Stanley |authorlink=Stanley Loomis |year=1964 |publisher=J.B.

==Background==
Catholic clergy and [[<U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>]]s had been victims of angry pro-republican violence and forced deportations by ''[[sans-culottes]]'' since the Decree of 17 November 1791 went into force. However, it was the [[Law of Suspects]] ({{lang-fr|Loi des suspects}}) approved by the [[National Convention]] of the [[French First Republic]] on 17 September 1793 that swept the nation with "revolutionary paranoia".<ref>Jean Tulard, Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Fayard, & Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et Dictionnaire de la R<U+00E9>volution fran<U+00E7>aise'', <U+00C9>d. Bouquins-Robert Laffont, 1997, ISBN 978-2221045886</ref> This decree defined a broad range of conduct as suspicious in the vaguest terms, and did not give individuals any means of redress. 

[[Nantes]], in particular, was besieged by the tragedies of the French civil [[war in the Vend<U+00E9>e]] at its doorstep. Threats of [[epidemic]]s and [[starvation]] were always present. Battles, skirmishes, and police actions led to the [[incarceration]] of more than ten thousand [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] within its confines, and simply feeding them became enormous burden for the city's residents. To control the situation, the leaders of the [[National Convention]] put [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]], a native of the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] region, in change of obtaining food supplies for Republican soldiers in Nantes. He soon became responsible for furnishing provisions to the entire local population, as well as for maintaining order and putting down suspected royalist revolts.

Fear that [[contagious disease]]s, particularly [[Epidemic typhus|typhus]], would spread from prisoners to the general population reached levels of panic in the fall of 1793. Heavy losses of inmates' lives recorded by military personnel, physicians, nurses, and even judges, shocked civic leaders and pushed them to try anything to stop the further spread of illness. Ultimately, they chose to empty the jails in the city center and to place the inmates at the Coffee Warehouse jail at the port and on vessels moored in the harbor.

==First mass drownings==
[[Image:Terreur Noyades Nantes.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Drownings at Nantes (Noyades de Nantes)'', etching by Jean Duplessis-Bertaux (ca. 1794), enhanced with color]]
The first drownings targeted 160 obstinate, anti-republican Catholic priests, called 'refractory clergy' ({{lang-fr|clerg<U+00E9> r<U+00E9>fractaire}}), who were particularly hostile to all aspects of the Revolution. On the nights of 16 & 17 November 1793 (26 & 27 [[Brumaire]] Year II), Guillaume Lamberty directing O'Sullivan, a renowned [[Swordsmanship|master of arms]], and his men, executed the first 90 priests by drowning. Nearly all died as planned, however, three of them were rescued by sailors on the warship ''L'Imposant'', who in turn, handed them back to civil authorities in Nantes. 

After being returned to jail, they perished with the second group of priests who were drowned the next day. A single soul survived this massacre, named Father Landeau. An excellent swimmer, he managed to escape during a struggle, jumped from the boat into the Loire, and swam to safety.

==Second drownings==
The second mass drowning of priests was also led by Guillaume Lamberty. Several men in his guard led by Marat Foucauld systematically stripped 58 clergymen who had been transported from [[Angers]]. The priests were then led to a specially equipped barge and taken far from the port of Nantes to the mouth of the river where they were submersed. This time, no one survived.

==Conference of 14 & 15 Frimaire==
On the evening of 4 December 1793 (14 [[Frimaire]], [[French Republican calendar|Year II of the French Republic]]), [[Jean-Baptiste Carrier]], key members of the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes, Fran<U+00E7>ois-Louis Ph<U+00E9>lippes Tronjolly and colleagues, Julien Min<U+00E9>e for the [[Departments of France|department]], Renard for the city, and representatives of the Vincent-la-Montagne Company, all met. In the course of heated discussions, they appointed a jury to name so-called "criminals." The next day, the jury presented more than three hundred names on a list, which became [[Capital punishment|orders for execution]]. To carry out the judgements, Carrier imagined a radical process he [[euphemism|euphemistically]] called "vertical deportation": rather than deporting criminals to remote [[penal colony]] islands, he proposed loading the condemned onto flat bottom boats, and drowning them by casting them out in the middle of the [[Loire river|Loire]] at Chantenay, an adjacent village. The executions were to be carried out at night, in secrecy, however there was concern among members of the committee that corpses would begin floating-up to the surface, sometimes days later. These concerns proved to be justified. 

Two groups received the task of conducting the executions: Guillaume Lamberty and his men, and the Marat Company of Revolutionary Guards, known as the 'American [[Hussar]]s' ({{lang-fr|hussards am<U+00E9>ricains}}) due to the presence of former Black slaves and settlers from [[Saint-Domingue]] in its ranks.

==Bouffay (third) drownings==

The third drowning, known as the Bouffay Drownings, are perhaps better known than the previous two events. This execution took the lives of 129 prisoners on the nights of 14 & 15 December 1793 (24 & 25 [[Frimaire]], Year II). Led by Jean-Jacques Goullin and Michel Moreau-Grandmaison, the Marat Company went to Bouffay Prison, most of them [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]]. Unable or unwilling to consult their lists, the soldiers went at random, grabbing prisoners from their cells, stripped them of their belongings and money, then, tied them into pairs to heavy rocks. Once loaded onto a flat boat, the guards sailed the anguished men only a short distance downstream and cast them off little further than [[Rez<U+00E9>|Trentemoult]], a fishing village directly opposite Nantes, near the island of Chevir<U+00E9>.

==Fourth drownings==
The drownings of 23 December 1793 (3 [[Niv<U+00F4>se]], Year II) were recorded by three different accounts, with the accuracy of least two stories verified and confirmed. This time, Pierre Robin, Fouquet, and their accomplises forced approximately eight hundred captured 'royalist sympathizers' of all ages and sexes onto two boats, which only sailed as far as Chantenay and drowned them.

Among the most humiliating drownings were what was termed the 'underwater marriages', where a priest and a nun, stripped naked, were tied together before they were drowned. These drownings were also called 'republican baptisms' or '[[republican marriage]]s.'<ref name=Loomis289/>

==The galiot drownings==
The next executions, from 29 December 1793 (9 Niv<U+00F4>se, Year II) to 18 January 1794 (29 Niv<U+00F4>se, Year II), were known as the [[Galiot]] Drownings ({{lang-fr|Noyades des galiotes}}). Two-masted [[Netherlands|Dutch]] galiots <U+2013> small trade ships <U+2013> moored in Nantes as a result of a [[Navy|naval]] [[blockade]], were moved on this occasion to the quay next to the Coffee Warehouse jail where the condemned could easily board. Whether the galiots made two, three, or more drowning 'expeditions' is unknown, however, the lives of two hundred to three hundred victims <U+2013> men, women and children <U+2013> were lost on each sailing. At least one boat was intentionally sunk in the Loire loaded with victims in the [[hold (ship)|hold]] and the [[trapdoor|hatches]] sealed.<ref>George James Hill, ''The story of the war in La Vend<U+00E9>e and the little Chouannerie'', New York: Sadlier, 1856, p.125</ref>   

Records indicate that the last drownings using these Dutch vessels were organized by Carrier himself, who completely emptied out the Coffee Warehouse jail of all prisoners. These executions were perpetrated on the nights of 29 & 30 January 1794 (10 & 11 [[Pluvi<U+00F4>se]], Year II) and involved about four hundred people.

==Last drownings==
[[Image:Entrepot des cafes.jpg|thumb|200px| Translation of a historical marker: "Former Coffee Warehouse Jail. During the Terror in the winter of 1793-1794, at the time of the mission of J.-B. Carrier (who was condemned to death by the Revolutionary Tribunal in Paris and guillotined on 16 December 1794), 8 to 9,000 citizens of the Vend<U+00E9>e, Anjou, the Nantes region, and Poitou - men, women, and children - were encarcerated at this jail. Nearly all perished. Victims of starvation and typhus were shot near Gigant quarry or drowned in the Loire. -- The people of Nantes were equal prey to the Terror."]]
The final mass drownings took place on 27 February 1794  (9 [[Vent<U+00F4>se]], Year II). According to official documents read to the [[National Convention]] in Paris on 12 October 1794 (21 Vend<U+00E9>miaire, Year III), these drownings were ordered by Adjutant General Lef<U+00E8>bvre resulting in 41 deaths: one 78 year-old blind man and another man, 12 women, 12 girls, and 15 children, including 10 who were only 6 to 10 years old and 5 infants. This execution took place in [[Bourgneuf-en-Retz|Bourgneuf]] Bay.

==Estimated number of victims==
The precise number of victims is not known. According to Roger Dupuy, there were between 7 and 11 drowning executions, with 300 to 400 victims each time.<ref>Roger Dupuy, ''La Bretagne sous la R<U+00E9>volution et l'Empire (1789-1815)'', Ouest-France Universit<U+00E9>, 2004, p.133.</ref> According to Jacques Hussenet, 1,800 to 4,800 people drowned on the orders of Carrier, and perhaps 2,000 others drowned on the orders by other Republican revolutionaries in Nantes.<ref>Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ''<U+00AB> D<U+00E9>truisez la Vend<U+00E9>e ! <U+00BB> Regards crois<U+00E9>s sur les victimes et destructions de la guerre de Vend<U+00E9>e'', La Roche-sur-Yon, Centre vend<U+00E9>en de recherches historiques, 2007, p.458.</ref> Jean-Cl<U+00E9>ment Martin wrote that between 1,800 and 4,000 people died in mass drownings.<ref>Jean-Cl<U+00E9>ment Martin, ''Blancs et Bleus dans la Vend<U+00E9>e d<U+00E9>chir<U+00E9>e'', D<U+00E9>couvertes/Gallimard, 1986, p.102.</ref> In 1879, Alfred Lallie reported that 4,860 people were drowned<ref>Alfred Lalli<U+00E9>, ''Les noyades de Nantes'', 1879, p.90.</ref> confirmed by [[Hippolyte Taine]].<ref>Hippolyte Taine, ''Les origines de la France contemporaine. La R<U+00E9>volution : le gouvernement r<U+00E9>volutionnaire, le r<U+00E9>gime moderne'', Edition Robert Laffont, 1896, p.224.</ref> According Reynald Secher, 4,800 victims suffered execution by drowning just during the fall 1793.<ref>Reynald Secher, ''La Vend<U+00E9>e-Veng<U+00E9>: le g<U+00E9>nocide franco-fran<U+00E7>ais'', Perrin, 2006, p.153.</ref> For Gaston Martin, about 1800 died, for Fouquet 9000 died, for Mellinet 3500 were killed.<ref>Nathalie Meyer-Sabl<U+00E9>, Christian Le Corre, ''La Chouannerie et les guerres de Vend<U+00E9>e'', <U+00C9>dition Ouest-France, 2007, 127 p.</ref>

According to historian Reynald Secher, these murders are one component of a systematic policy of extermination ([[genocide]]) of the residents of the Vend<U+00E9>e planned by the revolutionary Committee of Public Safety, and approved by a vote of the [[National Convention]] in Paris on 1 October 1793.<ref>Reynald Secher, ''Vend<U+00E9>e, du g<U+00E9>nocide au m<U+00E9>moricide'', <U+00C9>ditions du Cerf, 2011.</ref>

==Trial of Jean-Baptiste Carrier==
{{Main|Jean-Baptiste Carrier}}
Although the most heinous crimes committed by Jean-Baptiste Carrier are his direction of the mass drownings at Nantes, he also was responsible for the shooting executions of 1,800 to 2,600 victims at a quarry in Gigant, near Nantes, and collaborated on other criminal and repressive acts that he justified by the [[Law of Suspects]]. His extreme paranoia was no more apparent than in the Affair of 132 Nantes Moderates ({{lang-fr|Affaire des 132 mod<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>s nantais}}), a "tragicomedy of justice" that involved the round-up of more than 132 men<ref>[http://wikilivres.info/wiki/Liste_des_132_Nantais_transf%C3%A9r%C3%A9s_%C3%A0_Paris_pendant_la_Terreur Wikilivres, ''Liste des 132 Nantais transf<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>s <U+00E0> Paris pendant la Terreur'']</ref> from all walks of life vaguely accused of politically moderate 'federalism', who were imprisoned, tried in Paris, and subsequently acquitted of all charges.

Carrier was recalled to Paris in early 1794 to participate in the trial of [[Robespierre]]. At first, the Thermidorians left Carrier in peace, but members of the Revolutionary Committee of Nantes soon covered him with insults and accusations. Based on overwhelming evidence, he was arrested in Paris on 3 September 1794 and indicted 27 November. At his trial, he clumsily and sarcastically stated that he knew nothing about what he was accused. However, he was immediately denounced by those closest to him and charged with the drownings, executions, butchering of women and children, thefts, acts of greed, as well as exacerbating the strife that Nantes suffered. A unanimous vote called for Carrier's execution, and he was [[guillotine]]d on 16 December 1794.<ref>Comte Fleury, ''Carrier <U+00E0> Nantes, 1793<U+2013>1794'', Paris: 1897</ref><ref>Alfred Lalli<U+00E9>, ''J.<U+2013>B.
