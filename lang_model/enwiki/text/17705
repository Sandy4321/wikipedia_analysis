== Church Politics ==

=== Vision of the Church of Nigeria ===

One of his first actions as primas was, to get together 400 bishops, priests, lay members and members of the Mother's Union to elaborate a vision for the Church of Nigeria under chairman [[Ernest Shonekan]], a former president of Nigeria. The process consisted in a sober, realistic assessment of the present situation, working out a vision in several groups and consolidating them in the plenary session. The realistic steps were worked out to attain this vision. <ref>[http://www.anglican-nig.org/vision.htm Vision of the Church of Nigeria]</ref>

The vision elaborated was:
:"The Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion) shall be; bible-based, spiritually dynamic, united, disciplined, self supporting, committed to pragmatic evangelism, social welfare and a Church that epitomizes the genuine love of Christ." <ref>[http://www.anglican-nig.org/vision.htm Vision of the Church of Nigeria]</ref>

Part of the program of actions were, e.g.
* on central level
** translating the books of liturgy in further languages
** establishing a group of 3000 leading lay personalities who will take care of fundraising and relieve the bishops of this duty
** establish a legal support team to enforce the constituional right of freedom of religion and worship
** das Bilden eines juristischen Unterst<U+00FC>tzungsteams um das verfassungsgem<U+00E4>sse Recht der Religionsfreiheit durchzusetzen
** establish colleges for theology and universities
** provide internet access for the dioceses 

* for each diocese
** training fulltime itinerant evangelists
** on the job trainign for priests and their wives
** working out a social welfare program for less privileged people
** establish a hospital with at least 30 beds
** establish secondary schools

* on community level
** literacy courses for adults
** set up cottage industries for the unemployed

===Relations with the Anglican Communion===

[[Image:Akinola1.jpg|left|thumb||Archbishop Peter Akinola with Episcopal dress.]]

In September [[2005]], Bishop Akinola spoke out against the [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/dojustice/j311.html Church in Brazil] deposition of an Evangelical bishop and [[excommunication]] of over 30 priests [http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/news05090202.asp].

In September [[2005]], the Church of Nigeria's relationship to other churches in the Anglican Communion was defined, clarifying that Church's tensions with Canterbury. The Church of Nigeria is in "communion with the [[Church of England|See of Canterbury]]" and in "communion with all Anglican Churches, Dioceses and Provinces that hold and maintain the 'Historic Faith, Doctrine, Sacrament and Discipline of the one holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church'." <small>[http://www.anglican-nig.org/Onitsha2005_pressls2.htm (source)]</small>  

On [[November 12, 2005]] Akinola signed a Covenant of Concordat with the Presiding Bishops of the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Province of America]].

Akinola's name heads the list of conservative bishops' signatories to a [http://www.globalsouthanglican.org/index.php/article/global_south_primates_response_to_archbishop_rowan_williams letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury] on November 15, 2005. In this letter Europe is described as "a spiritual desert" and the actions of the Church of England in supporting the new civil partnerships laws are said to give "the appearance of evil". Three of the bishops whose names appear on the document at the Global South website denied signing the actual letter though they count themselves among "Global South bishops".

==Views concerning Homosexuality==

In [[August 2003]] he stated that if the homosexual and partnered Dr. [[Jeffrey John]] was consecrated as Bishop of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] or the homosexual and partnered [[Gene Robinson]] consecrated as Bishop of [[New Hampshire]], the [[Church of Nigeria]] would leave the [[Anglican Communion]]. A number of dioceses throughout the world, including the [[Sydney Anglicans|Diocese of Sydney]], made similar statements. In the face of growing controversy, Jeffrey John declined to be bishop and was, instead, appointed as Dean of St Albans.  Vicky Gene Robinson's consecration went forward, precipitating a crisis in the [[Anglican Communion]]. Akinola has been a vocal leader among those who claim that the Communion can not logically accommodate those on both sides of the same-sex argument because the opposng views are irreconcilable.

Akinola was among the Global South leaders who opposed the concentration of Vicky Gene Robinson, the first openly homosexual bishop in the Anglican Communion. This group successfully backed the suspension of ECUSA's representatives from the [[Anglican Consultative Council]]'s meeting in [[Nottingham]] in [[2005]]. In August [[2005]] he denounced a statement of the Church of England's [[House of Bishops]] on [http://www.anglican-nig.org/prmtstmt_civilprtship.htm civil partnerships] and called for the disciplining of the Church of England and ECUSA on the grounds that the Church has not changed its position on same-sex partnerships. Since the Anglican Communion has historically been defined as those Churches in communion with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|See of Canterbury]], whose Archbishop is head of the Church of England and thus ''primus inter pares'' in the Anglican Communion, this led to speculation that Akinola was positioning himself as a possible international leader of a more conservative church than the present Anglican Communion, which would no longer recognise the authority or primacy of the Archbishop of Canterbury. However, Akinola continues to work with Global South and conservative American bishops as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, so that his churchmanship remains conciliar. 

In February 2006, Akinola issued a communique on behalf of his Church of Nigeria Standing Committee stating ''"The Church commends the law-makers for their prompt reaction to outlaw same-sex relationships in Nigeria and calls for the bill to be passed since the idea expressed in the bill is the moral position of Nigerians regarding human sexuality."''  The bill in question, as well as criminalising same-sex marriage, also proposed to criminalise "Registration of Gay Clubs, Societies and organizations" and "Publicity, procession and public show of same-sex amorous relationship through the electronic or print media physically, directly, indirectly or otherwise", on penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment. The proposed legislation was formally challenged by the United States State Department as a possible breach of Nigeria's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but its passage suggested wide spread support by Nigerian legislators and was within the rights of the sovereign government of Nigeria. Some critics recognize that this legistlation provides for treatment preferable to that which homosexuals would receive under the Sharia code.

==Muhammad Cartoon Controversy==

In February 2006, after Muslims rioting over the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoon controversy]] targeted Christians and their property, resulting in a reported 43 deaths, 30 burned churches [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/22/AR2006022200876.html] and 250 destroyed shops and houses [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L20596890.htm], Akinola issued a statement in his capacity as President of the Christian Association of Nigeria that some interpreted as a veiled threat of violence against Muslims:  "May we at this stage remind our Muslim brothers that they do not have the monopoly of violence in this nation."  This was criticised by Bishop Cyril Okorocha of the Owerri diocese in Nigeria as "inflammatory" and "not the view of the whole Church". His critics claim that his statement caused a riot in Onitsha.  According to news source Al Jezeera, Christian mobs in [[Onitsha]] retaliated against Muslims, killing 80 persons,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4743672.stm], burned a Muslim district with 100 homes[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0602240148feb24,1,7889545.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed&ctrack=1&cset=true], defaced mosques[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002825506_cartoons24.html] and burned the corpses of those they had killed in the streets[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=vn20060224082007404C390883]. Hundreds of Muslims were forced to flee the city [http://www.irishexaminer.com/pport/web/world/Full_Story/did-sgGx1Jb-KGD-ssg0aewFBADppk.asp]. 

Defending Akinola's statement was American evangelical leader [[Rick Warren]]. Writing in ''Time'' magazine in April, 2006, he said, "[Akinola] has been criticized for recent remarks of frustration that some felt exacerbated Muslim-Christian clashes in his country. But Christians are routinely attacked in parts of Nigeria, and his anger was no more characteristic than [[Nelson Mandela]]'s apartheid-era statement that 'sooner or later this violence is going to spread to whites.'"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187221,00.html]
