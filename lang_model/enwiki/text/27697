'''''Banksia marginata''''', commonly known as the '''Silver Banksia''', is a species of tree or woody shrub in the plant [[genus]] ''[[Banksia]]'' found throughout much of southeastern Australia. It ranges from the [[Eyre Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]], to north of [[Armidale, New South Wales]], and across [[Tasmania]] and the islands of [[Bass Strait]]. It grows in various habitats, including ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' forest, [[Shrubland|scrub]], [[heath]]land and [[moorland]]. ''Banksia marginata'' varies widely in [[Habit (biology)|habit]], ranging from a small shrub, 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) high, to a large tree, 12&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) tall. The narrow leaves are [[leaf shape|linear]] and the yellow [[inflorescence]]s (flower spikes) occur from late summer to early winter. The flower spikes fade to brown and then grey and develop woody [[Follicle (fruit)|follicles]] bearing the winged seeds. Originally described by [[Antonio Jos<U+00E9> Cavanilles]] in 1800, further collections of ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' were described as several separate species by [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] in 1810. However, all were reclassified as a single species by  [[George Bentham]] in 1870. No distinct [[subspecies]] have been recognised by ''Banksia'' expert [[Alex George]], who nonetheless concedes that further work is needed.

Many species of bird, in particular [[honeyeater]]s, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to [[bushfire]] varies. Some populations are [[serotiny|serotinous]]: they are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the [[Canopy seed bank|plant canopy]] and are released. Others regenerate from underground [[lignotuber]]s or [[Basal shoot|suckers]] from lateral roots. Although it has been used for [[timber]], ''Banksia marginata'' is most commonly seen as a garden plant, with [[Dwarfing|dwarf]] forms being commercially [[Plant propagation|propagated]] and sold.

A widely distributed and diverse plant, ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' was described independently and given many different names by early explorers. It was first collected by [[Luis N<U+00E9>e]] in 1793, from somewhere between [[Sydney]] and [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]. In 1800, the Spanish botanist [[Antonio Jos<U+00E9> Cavanilles]] gave the species the binomial name it still bears today.<ref name=apni>{{APNI | name =''Banksia marginata'' Cav. | id = 54354}}</ref> The species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''marginatus'' ("bordered") and refers to appearance of the lower surface of the recurved margins of the leaves when viewed from underneath.<ref name="George96">{{cite book|last=George|first=Alex S.|title=The Banksia Book|edition=3rd|year=1996|publisher=Kangaroo Press|location=Kenthurst, New South Wales|isbn=0-86417-818-2|page=58}}</ref> Cavanilles also described another specimen collected by N<U+00E9>e in the same locality as a different species, ''Banksia microstachya'' Cav. A smaller shrub with [[wikt:dentate|dentate]] leaves, this turned out to be an immature plant of the same species with juvenile leaves.<ref>Salkin, p. 25.</ref>

[[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] described 31 species of ''Banksia'' in his 1810 work ''[[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]]'', including six taxa (''B.&nbsp;marginata'' <U+03B1> and <U+03B2> plus four further species) now attributable to ''B.&nbsp;marginata''. He split the genus into two subgenera, placing these species in subgenus ''Banksia verae'', the "True Banksias".<ref name="R.Br. 1810">{{cite book | author = [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Brown, Robert]] | year = 1810 | title = [[Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen]] | location = London, UK | publisher = Richard Taylor and Company}}</ref> He described ''Banksia australis'' R.Br., giving the location of the collection as [[Port Phillip|Port Phillip Bay]] in Victoria in 1802 (having crossed out [[Van Diemen's Land]] 1804).<ref>{{APNI | name =''Banksia australis'' R.Br. | id = 52797}}</ref> Brown's other  collections which were reduced to synonymy with  ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' were ''Banksia depressa'' R.Br., a prostrate shrub from [[Margate Rivulet]] in southeastern Tasmania, ''Banksia insularis'' R.Br., from [[Flinders Island|Flinders]] and [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]], and ''Banksia patula'' R.Br., a shrub from the vicinity of [[Port Lincoln, South Australia]].<ref name="salkin78">{{cite journal|last=Salkin, Alf; Hallam, N.D. |year=1978|title=The topodemes of ''Banksia canei'' J.H.

By the time [[Carl Meissner]] published [[Meissner's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|his 1856 arrangement]] of the genus, there were 58 described ''Banksia'' species. Meissner divided Brown's ''Banksia verae'', which had been renamed ''Eubanksia'' by [[Stephan Endlicher]] in 1847,<ref name="George 1981">{{The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)}}</ref> into four series based on leaf properties. He listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' in series [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Salicinae'']].<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Carl Meissner|Meissner, Carl]] | year = 1856 | chapter = Proteaceae | editor = [[A.

In 1870, [[George Bentham]] published a thorough revision of ''Banksia'' in his landmark publication ''[[Flora Australiensis]]''. In [[Bentham's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|Bentham's arrangement]], the number of recognised ''Banksia'' species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham observed that the characteristics Brown used to define ''B.&nbsp;australis'', ''B.&nbsp;depressa'', ''B.&nbsp;patula'', and ''B.&nbsp;insularis'' were unable to distinguish separate [[Form (botany)|forms]] as more specimens came to light, and hence declared them synonyms of ''B.&nbsp;marginata''. Meissner's four series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, [[style (botany)|style]] and [[pollen-presenter]] characters. ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' was placed in section ''Eubanksia'' along with ''B.&nbsp;integrifolia'' and ''[[Banksia dentata|B.&nbsp;dentata]]''.<ref name="Bentham 1870">{{cite encyclopedia | author = [[George Bentham|Bentham, George]] | year = 1870 | title = [[Wikisource:Flora Australiensis/Volume V/CIV.

=== Placement within ''Banksia'' ===
The current [[Taxonomy|taxonomic]] arrangement of the ''Banksia'' genus is based on botanist [[Alex George]]'s 1999 monograph for the ''[[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]]'' book series.<ref name="George 1999"/> In this arrangement, ''B.&nbsp;marginata'' is placed in ''Banksia'' [[subgenus]] ''[[Banksia subg. Banksia|Banksia]]'', because its inflorescences take the form of ''Banksia''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s characteristic flower spikes, [[Section (botany)|section]] [[Banksia sect. Banksia|''Banksia'']] because of its straight [[carpel|styles]], and [[Series (botany)|series]] [[Banksia ser. Salicinae|''Salicinae'']] because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] cladistic analysis published in 1994, [[Kevin Thiele]] placed it as the most basal member of a newly described subseries ''Integrifoliae'',  within the series ''Salicinae''.<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]]; Ladiges, Pauline Y. | year = 1996 | title = A cladistic analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661<U+2013>733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref> However, this subgrouping of the ''Salicinae'' was not supported by George.<ref name="George 1999"/> George did concede that major work is needed on ''Banksia marginata'', which shows such a high degree of variability over its range.<ref>{{cite journal | author =George, Alex S. |title=Proteus in Australia.

''B. marginata'' is generally fairly easy to grow in a well-drained sunny or part-shaded position in the garden. It can be leggy in shadier positions, or a more compact bushy shrub in full sun.
