'''London Buses route 171''' is a [[Transport for London]] contracted bus route in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. The service is currently contracted to [[London Central]].

==History==
===1952-1972===
Today's 171 was introduced on 6 April 1952 at Stage 7 of [[London Transport Executive|London Transport]]'s post-war "Tram to Buses" conversion scheme to replace [[Kingsway Tramway Subway|Kingsway Subway]] Tram route 33. It ran as a daily service between [[Tottenham|Tottenham (Bruce Grove)]] and [[West Norwood]] via [[Harringay]], [[Manor House, London|Manor House]], [[Green Lanes]], [[Newington Green]], [[Angel, Islington|Angel]], Rosebery Avenue, [[Kingsway]], [[Aldwych]], [[Victoria Embankment]], [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Kennington]], [[Brixton]], [[West Norwood|West Norwood (Thurlow Arms)]] extended Sunday to West Norwood (Bus Garage).
The section north of Manor House  to Tottenham was new territory, not previously served by [[London Buses]].

The route stayed quite stable for a few years until the 16 October 1957, when it swapped its Southern End with its [[London Buses route 172|sister route 172]] at Victoria Embankment to run to [[Forest Hill]] via [[Elephant & Castle]], [[Walworth, London|Walworth]], [[Camberwell]], [[Peckham]], [[New Cross]] and [[Brockley]]. This had the effect of leveling out the passenger loads on the Northern and Southern sections of both routes. 

Less than a year later on 20 August 1958, in the aftermath of the London Busmen's Strike of 1958, the 171 was diverted between Holborn Hall and [[County Hall, London|County Hall]] via [[Gray's Inn Road]], Chancery Lane, [[Fleet Street]], Aldwych, [[Waterloo Bridge]], replacing [[London Buses route 67|route 67]] which was withdrawn as an economy measure.

The next changes occurred on 23 January 1966, when the 171 was withdrawn on Sundays, to be replaced on that day by a Sunday only route 171A between Tottenham(Bruce Grove) and [[Abbey Wood]] via the 171 to New Cross and the [[London Buses route 163|163A]] to Abbey Wood via [[Greenwich]], [[Woolwich]] and [[Plumstead]]. This situation remained until 9 January 1972 when the 171 was re-introduced on Sundays, albeit only between Tottenham Garage and Forest Hill with the section to [[Bruce Grove]] being withdrawn on Sundays.

===1973-Present===
The Sunday service was converted to one-person operation as from 4 August 1985 and six months later on 1 February 1986, in order to counter reliability problems, the route was cut into two overlapping services. The 171 became a complicated service, running with crew operated buses on Mondays to Saturdays and one-person vehicles on Sundays, Daily from Forest Hill to Aldwych with a Sunday extension to Tottenham Garage. On Mondays to Fridays it was also extended from Aldwych to Rosebery Avenue. A new one-person operated 171A was introduced on Mondays to Saturdays over the Northern section between Tottenham (Bruce Grove) and [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo]].

This complicated set of routes were quickly altered and as from 21 June 1986 the 171 was withdrawn north of the Angel, Islington to be covered by the 171A which was introduced on Sundays. The 171 was still crew-operated on Mondays to Saturdays and ran daily from Forest Hill to Aldwych with a Monday to Friday extension to [[Islington Green]]. The 171A now ran daily between Waterloo and Tottenham, terminating at Bruce Grove on Mondays to Saturdays, but with a new extension to [[Northumberland Park railway station|Northumberland Park Station]] via Lansdowne Road on Sundays.

On 21 October 1986 the 171 was converted to one-person operation on Mondays to Saturdays using T-type Titan vehicles that had been in position on the route since September. At the same time the 171A received a small diversion, running Northbound via [[Fleet Street]] and New Fetter Lane instead of Chancery Lane.

A short extension to the 171A was added on 21 April 1990, when the route was extended from Waterloo to terminate at County Hall. The next year on 16 November 1991 the Monday to Saturday 171A service to Tottenham (Bruce Grove) was re-routed to Northumberland Park Station to bring it in line with the Sunday service.

The next couple of years saw the 171 and 171A settle down to how they are today, with the 171 being withdrawn between [[Holborn tube station|Holborn Station]] and Islington on 18 July 1992. At the other end of the route the 171 was extended from Forest Hill to [[Catford|Catford Garage]] as from 12 March 1994. Since which time the 171 has remained unchanged.

On 18 February 1996, [[Edward O'Brien (Irish republican)|Edward O'Brien]], an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] operative, was killed when an improvised high-explosive device detonated prematurely on a Number 171 bus travelling along Aldwych towards King's Cross.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/news/armed-guard-on-ira-bus-bomb-suspect-1319854.html</ref> It also injured eight other passengers.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/world/1-dies-8-hurt-as-blast-rips-bus-in-center-of-london.html</ref>

The 171A continued on for a few more years without change, except for an extension to Northumberland Park (Tescos) as from 28 March 1998, replacing journeys on the [[London Buses route 76|76]] and just over six months later, the two 171 services were separated for good when the 171A was re-numbered [[London Buses route 341|341]] as from 18 October 1998.
