==Background==
===Early life===
Chandler was born to Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson and raised in Cincinnati, approximately 100 miles from where the Rogers family were living. Chandler was the fourth of five children in his family.<ref name="Andelman-2000">{{cite news|last=Andelman|first=Bob|title=Welcome to Florida: Don't Go Near the Water|url=http://files.andelman.com/ARTICLES/obachandler.html|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|year=2000|accessdate=January 2, 2007}}</ref> When Chandler was only 10 years old, his father hanged himself in the basement of the family's apartment.<ref name="Andelman-2000">{{cite news|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|title=Welcome to Florida: Don't Go Near the Water|url=http://files.andelman.com/ARTICLES/obachandler.html|year=2000|accessdate=January 2, 2007}}</ref> His father's death in June 1957 affected Chandler so much that he jumped into the open grave at the funeral as the gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt.<ref name="AD-5p3">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 5: Silver Bullet|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/silver.3.html|page=3|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> After that, Chandler's life spun out of control. He was stealing cars by age 14 and was arrested 20 times while he was a juvenile. As an adult he was charged with a long list of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping and armed robbery.<ref name="11CCoA-OCvJMCC-2006">{{cite web|author=[[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals]]|title=Oba Chandler v. James McDonough, Charlie Crist|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1366213.html|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|date=December 18, 2006|accessdate=November 2, 2008}}</ref>

He was once accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window, and on another occasion of receiving 21 wigs stolen from a beauty parlor.<ref name="Andelman-2000" /> In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into the home of a Florida couple and held them at gunpoint while robbing them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire, and then Chandler took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear and also tied her up.<ref name="AD-5p3" /> While she lay on the bed, he rubbed the barrel of his revolver across the woman's stomach. 

Chandler fathered a total of eight children, the latest one being Whitney, born in February 1989.<ref name="Andelman-2000" /> Between May and September of 1991, Chandler worked as an informant for the [[United States Customs|U.S. Customs]] Tampa office, at the same time that Tampa police investigated the Rogers family triple murder.<ref name="SHT-19921002-informant">{{cite news|title=Triple-Murder Suspect Worked as Informant|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ijweAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ib8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4784,2083889&dq=oba+chandler&hl=en|newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|agency=Associated Press|paged=6B|date=October 2, 1992|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}</ref>

===Facts of the crime===
On May 26, 1989, Joan "Jo" Rogers, 36, and her daughters - Michelle, 17, and Christe, 14 - left their family [[dairy farm]] in [[Willshire Township, Van Wert County, Ohio|Willshire, Ohio]] for a vacation in Florida.

On June 1,  authorities believe, the women became lost while looking for their hotel. They encountered Chandler, who gave them directions and offered to meet them again later to take them on a sunset cruise of Tampa Bay.<ref name="AD-4p2">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 4: The Tin Man|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/tin_man.2.html|page=2|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref> It is known that the Rogers women left [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] that morning around 9 a.m.<ref name="AD-1p3">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.3.html|page=3|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}</ref> and checked into the [[Days Inn]] on [[Florida State Road 60|Route 60]] at 12:30 p.m. Snapshots recovered from a camera left in their car showed the last picture of Michelle while she was alive, and even the sun setting on the same bay where their lives later ended.<ref name="AD-1p1">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.1.html|page=1|accessdate=December 23, 2008}}</ref> They were last seen alive at the hotel restaurant around 7:30 p.m. It is believed they boarded Chandler's boat at the dock on the [[Courtney Campbell Causeway]] (part of Route 60) between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m., and that they were dead by 3 a.m. Chandler could also have used the fact that he was born in Ohio to lure them into feeling more connected with him.<ref name="TheBlade-19890610-jolted">{{cite news|last=Saunders|first=Jim|title=One-stoplight town jolted by 3 slayings in Florida|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bkRPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4127,934133&dq=oba+chandler|newspaper=[[The Blade]]|location=[[Toledo, Ohio]]|page=1|date=June 10, 1989|accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref> It is also believed that he knew that the women were not from Florida, as he recognized the Ohio car plates since he himself was originally from Cincinnati.<ref name="AD-1p9">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.9.html|page=9|accessdate=July 2, 2009}}</ref>

===The discovery of the bodies===
[[Image:Sunshine Skyway from Tampa Bay.jpeg|220px|thumb|right|[[Sunshine Skyway]] over Tampa Bay where the first body was found on June 4, 1989]]
The women's bodies were found floating in [[Tampa Bay]] on June 4, 1989, with bound hands and feet, concrete blocks tied to their necks and duct tape over their mouths. The first body was found floating when a sailboat, on its way home to Tampa after a trip to [[Key West]], had just crossed under the [[Sunshine Skyway]] when several people on board saw an object in the water. This was  identified as a dead female.<ref name="SPT-20001103-tries">{{cite news|last=Nealy|first=Jounice L.|title=Killer tries again for new trial|url=http://www.saintpetersburgtimes.com/News/110300/news_pf/TampaBay/Killer_tries_again_fo.shtml|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=November 3, 2000|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref> The second body was floating to the north of where the first had been sighted. It was 2 miles off The Pier in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]]. While the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] went to recover the second body, a call came in of yet a third female, seen floating only a couple of hundred yards to the east. Like the first two victims found, this body was face down, bound, with a rope around the neck and naked below the waist. 

Autopsies indicated the three women had been thrown into the water while still alive.<ref name="AD-1p10">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.10.html|page=10|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref> This was bolstered by water found in their [[lung]]s and the fact that Michelle had freed one arm from her bonds before succumbing. Michelle was thereby identified as the second victim found in Tampa Bay and recovered. The partially-dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault.<ref name="AD-1p10">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.10.html|page=10|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref> The blocks were tied around each of their necks to make sure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and to make sure the bodies were never found. However, the bodies ended up being found when they bloated due to decomposition and floated to the surface.<ref name="AD-1p10" />

==Investigation==
===Subsequent investigation===
The women were not positively identified until a week later, by which time they had been reported missing back home in Ohio by the husband and father, Hal Rogers.<ref name="AD-1p12">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.12.html|page=12|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref> A housekeeper at the Days Inn noted on June 8 that nothing in the room had been disturbed, and that beds had not been slept in. She contacted the general manager, who then contacted the police.<ref name="AD-1p10">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.10.html|page=10|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref>[[Fingerprint]] matches to the bodies  were made from those found in the room. Final confirmation of their identification came from dental records sent from the Rogerses' dentist in Ohio. [[Marine (ocean)|Marine]] researchers at [[Florida International University]] studied the currents and patterns, and confirmed that the women were tossed from a boat and not from a bridge or dry land, and that it had happened anywhere from two to five days before they were found. This was confirmed when the Rogers car, a 1984 [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais|Oldsmobile Calais]] with Ohio license plates, was found at the boat dock on the Courtney Campbell Causeway.<ref name="AD-1p12">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.12.html|page=12|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}</ref>

===Facts pointing to Chandler and arrest===
The case remained unsolved and cold for over three years, partly due to the volume of tips pouring in to the police who investigated the crime.<ref name="TheBlade-20020926-bitter">{{cite news|last=Lis|first=John|title=Farmer who lost kin bitter about rumours|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iH8UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1820,6814155&dq=oba+chandler|newspaper=The Blade|location=Toledo, Ohio|page=1|date=September 26, 1992|accessdate=August 30, 2009}}</ref> Chandler was not arrested for the murders until September 24, 1992.<ref name="SPT-20001103-tries" />
<ref name="TheBlade-20020926-bitter" /> His handwritten directions on a brochure found in the Rogers vehicle, along with a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to his being named a suspect. Also, authorities had posted the handwriting from the brochure on billboards, which was historic as it was used for the first time in an attempt to find an unknown killer. This led to a tip from a former neighbor who was able to provide a copy of a work order that Chandler had written. A handwriting analysis conclusively matched the two. <ref name="TheBlade-20020926-bitter" /> Another neighbor, as well as one of the secretaries on the investigative task force, also thought that Chandler resembled the [[composite sketch]] of the suspect in a seemingly related rape case (see next paragraph). A palmprint from the brochure was also matched to Chandler. Moreover, Chandler had sold his boat and left town with his family soon after the billboards appeared all over the Tampa Bay area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Montaldo|first=Charles|title=Oba Chandler: Florida Death Row Inmate|url=http://crime.about.com/od/deathrow/ig/Florida-Death-Row-Inmates/Oba-Chandler.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref> In 1990, when the [[television program|TV show]] ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' was about to report on the deaths of the Rogers family, Chandler and his then-wife moved from their home on Dalton Avenue in Tampa to [[Port Orange]] near [[Daytona Beach]]. This is believed to be because Chandler felt more worried about being caught because of the upcoming television show about his crime.<ref name="TheBlade-20020926-bitter" />

===Second suspect===
Investigators originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders of the Rogers women. This theory was reflected in a 1990 episode of the American crime television show ''Unsolved Mysteries'', in which a reenactment of the crime depicted two men leaving the dock with the three women on board a boat.<ref name="AD-1p11">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.11.html|page=11|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}</ref> This theory, however, was dismissed when Chandler was arrested. Other than a claim by a former prison cellmate that Chandler has said there was another man involved - whom the cellmate claimed to know the identity of but would not name - no evidence has ever surfaced regarding the involvement of anyone other than Chandler. The second-suspect theory is belied by Chandler's approach of two [[Canadians|Canadian]] women - that he had the willingness to approach more than one potential target by himself.<ref name="AD-2p4">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 2: Haunted|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/haunted.4.html|page=4|accessdate=June 2, 2008}}</ref>

John Rogers, Hal Rogers's brother, was also seriously considered a suspect even though he was in jail at the time.  John Rogers was in fact serving a jail term for the rape of Hal's daughter Michelle.<ref name="SPT-20001103-tries" /> Soon investigators established that John did not have the connections in jail to have done the murders via a hitman or friend. John Rogers was released from prison in 2004 and has had no further contact with his brother Hal since.<ref name="AD-2p4" />

While living in a trailer in [[Willshire]], John had allegedly lured two teenage girls there and sexually abused them. Subsequent police investigation turned up evidence indicating that he had also done the same to Michelle. This caused a major rift in the family and may have played an indirect part in the eventual murders. The idea that he may have planned the crime was bolstered by the fact that his and Hal's parents had property near Tampa, and that he had visited the area a month before the murders. However, he was a general loner with little close ties to even his own family, let alone friends, so such a plan, if there were one, would have been beyond character for him. For this, and the simple reason that he did not know ''when'' his sister-in-law and nieces would be there, he was dismissed as a suspect.<ref name="AD-2p4" />

Hal Rogers was also considered a suspect because he had posted bail for his brother ''after'' he knew of his abuse of Michelle.<ref name="AD-1p6">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 1: Sunset|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/sunset.6.html|page=6|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref> Hal Rogers said later that he had promised the family to make bail and would not go back on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also found out that Hal Rogers had withdrawn $7,000 from his bank at the time of the disappearance.<ref name="AD-2p4" /> When questioned about it, he showed investigators a satchel with most of the money in it. He planned on using it to go and search for his wife and daughters himself before he was notified of their deaths. Also, subsequent investigation conclusively proved he had never left Ohio during that time period.<ref name="AD-1p11" />The rape and the hype around Michelle Rogers as a person by people in the neighborhood and media was one of the reasons why the Florida trip was done, so Michelle, her sister and her mother could get some distance from the incident.<ref name="AD-1p6" />

==Trial==
===Chandler's testimony===
At trial, Chandler admitted meeting the Rogers women and giving them directions, but claimed he never saw them again except in the newspaper and on billboards.<ref name="TheBlade-19940922-Chandler">{{cite news|last=Allen Jr.|first=Eddie B.|title=Chandler|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lIAUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WwMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6719,6037974&dq=oba+chandler|newspaper=The Blade|location=Toledo, Ohio|page=6|date=September 22, 1994|accessdate=September 1, 2009}}</ref> Yet he never came forward to tell authorities that he had seen the women.<ref name="BRN-19940920-testify" /> He acknowledged he was on Tampa Bay that night, but that he was fishing alone - a fact he could not deny since the police had evidence of three ship-to-shore phone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murders. He explained that the reason he was so late in coming home was that his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak he claimed to have found near dawn. <ref name="TheBlade-19940922-Chandler" /> He claimed he had called the Coast Guard and [[Water police|Florida Marine Patrol]], but they were busy elsewhere.<ref name="BRN-19940920-testify" /> Finally, he claimed he flagged down a Coast Guard patrol boat, but they were busy and promised to send him help. Then he claimed to have fixed the line with duct tape, which allowed him to make it back safely to shore.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51853704.html?dids=51853704:51853704&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Aug+03,+1994&author=CRAIG+PITTMAN&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&desc=Prosecutors%3A+Chandler%27s+talk+is+his+undoing&pqatl=google|title=Prosecutors: Chandler's talk is his undoing|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=June 26, 2009|last=Pittman|first=Craig|date=August 3, 1994}}</ref> His testimony was quickly refuted by the [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] Prosecutor, Douglas Crow, who verbally sparred with Chandler to demonstrate that he had in fact lied about everything. All Chandler could muster in response to the prosecutor's repeated questions was, "I don't remember."<ref name="TheBlade-19940922-Chandler" />
 
This defense won him few sympathizers on a jury that quickly saw through his fa<U+00E7>ade, not to mention the inconsistencies in his statements. Moreover, there were no records of any distress calls from Chandler that night to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning to help him.<ref name="SPT-20001103-tries" /> A boat mechanic testified for the prosecution to refute Chandler's claim of mechanical trouble. He testified that Chandler's explanation for repairing the boat's alleged gas leak could not have happened as he had portrayed it. Chandler's boat, a [[Bayliner]], had a distinctive engine in which the fuel lines were directed upward.<ref name="TheBlade-19940922-Chandler" /> Such a leak would have sprayed fuel into the air instead of leaking into the boat, not to mention that the corrosive effects of the gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape that had supposedly been used to repair the purported leak.<ref name="SPT-20001103-tries" />

===Witnesses===
Another lead was that on May 15, 1989 - two weeks prior to the Rogers murders - Chandler lured [[Canadian]] tourist Judy Blair onto his boat in nearby [[Madeira Beach, Florida|Madeira Beach]], raped her, then dropped her off back on land. Blair made her way back to her hotel room where her friend Barbara Mottram was waiting.<ref name="SCoF-OCvSoF-2003">{{cite web|author=[[Supreme Court of Florida]]|title=Oba Chandler v. State of Florida|url=http://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-supreme-court/1008575.html|publisher=FindLaw|date=April 17, 2003|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}</ref> He was not charged or tried for this crime.<ref name="SCoF-OCvSoF-2003" /> It is thought he did not murder her because Barbara refused his offer to join them on the boat, a decision which more than likely saved both their lives. As a result, Judy Blair testified during his trial for the murders to establish his pattern of attack and the similarities between the two crimes. Blair testified that on May 14, Chandler gave his name as Dave Posner or Posno when the three first met at a convenience store in Tampa.<ref name="SCoF-OCvSoF-2003" /> Presumably he gave the same alias to the Rogerses. He did tell Blair and Mottram he was in the aluminum contracting business, which helped lead investigators to him, as well as the naming of the investigation to capture him: ''Operation Tin Man''. The description that Judy gave was also posted on the billboards along with the handwriting samples.

Additionally, a former employee of Chandler's testified that Chandler bragged of dating three women that night on the bay, and that the next morning he arrived and delivered materials for a job by boat and immediately set out again - presumably to make sure his victims were dead. In an attempt to establish Chandler's whereabouts on the night of the murders, investigators found phone records of several [[Marine VHF radio|radio marine]] [[telephone]] calls made from his boat to his home between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. These likely were an attempt to explain to his wife his absence<ref name="OSB-19940921-identifies">{{cite news|title=Man identifies slain wife,daughters|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19940921&id=scgTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tAcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5272,76800&dq=oba+chandler|newspaper=[[Ocala Star-Banner]]|agency=Associated Press|page=3B|date=September 21, 1994|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref> as well as to provide himself with an alibi for his whereabouts at the time of the murders.<ref name="Andelman-2000" /> Also, Chandler's own daughter Kristal May Sue testified against her father, saying that he talked about killing the three women and that he was afraid of going back to Tampa.<ref name="TheBlade-19940922-implicates">{{cite news|last=Allen Jr.|first=Eddie B.|title=Testimony implicates Chandler|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ekExAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WwMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4539,6017981&dq=oba+chandler|newspaper=The Blade|location=Toledo, Ohio|page=1|date=September 22, 1994|accessdate=September 1, 2009}}</ref> A maid who worked at the motel where the Rogers women stayed testified that she walked past Oba Chandler as she was going to the Rogerses' room for room service on June 1, implying that it seemed as if Chandler had just left the women's hotel room at around 12:30 that afternoon. The maid said she didn't realize the importance of this sighting until Chandler's arrest in 1992, although the sighting has never been confirmed.<ref name="SCoF-OCvSoF-2003" /> 

Hal Rogers and Michelle's boyfriend also took the stand during trial.<ref name="TheBlade-19940922-implicates" />  Hal identified the women and talked about his emotions on June 1. The boyfriend told about a phone conversation with Michelle.<ref name="OSB-19940921-identifies" />

===Sentence and aftermath===

Chandler was tried and found guilty of the murders, and was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] on November 4, 1994.<ref name="NYTimes-19941001-guilty">{{cite news|title=Man Found Guilty Of Killing 3 Tourists|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DA1439F932A35753C1A962958260|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|agency=Associated Press|date=October 1, 1994|accessdate=February 25, 2009}}</ref><ref name="BRN-19941105-sentences">{{cite news|title=Chandler gets three death sentences in Bay slayings|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kd8PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t40DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6740,1676412&dq=oba+chandler|newspaper=Boca Raton News|agency=Associated Press|page=5B|date=November 5, 1994|accessdate=June 5, 2009}}</ref><ref name="AD-7p2">{{cite news|last=French|first=Thomas|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|title=Angels & Demons Chapter 7: The Magic Kingdom|url=http://www2.sptimes.com/Angels_Demons/magic.2.html|page=2|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref> After sentencing, the juror forewoman commented regarding the death sentence that, "They need to do this swiftly. The man is a mutation of a human being and he needs to be destroyed." 

Chandler remains on Florida's Death Row, maintains his innocence and continues to pursue legal appeals.<ref name="TheBlade-19920926-slain">{{cite news|last=Lis|first=John|title=Slain family|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iH8UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6901,6828449&dq=oba+chandler|newspaper=The Blade|location=Toledo, Ohio|page=5|date=September 26, 1992|accessdate=July 14, 2009}}</ref> He has admitted the Madeira Beach incident but claims the sex was consensual, and that the victim had changed her mind during the act - which, in his words, was not possible for him to do.
