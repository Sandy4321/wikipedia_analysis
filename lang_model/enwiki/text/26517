Five cities made the shortlist to '''host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]''' (formally known as the '''Games of the XXX Olympiad'''), which were awarded to [[London]] ([[United Kingdom]]) on [[July 6]] [[2005]]. The other four shortlisted cities were [[Madrid]] ([[Spain]]), [[Moscow]] ([[Russia]]), [[New York City]] ([[USA]]), and [[Paris]] ([[France]]). The bids for the 2012 Olympics were considered to be one of the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC.<ref name="MSNBC">{{cite news |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8476616/ |title=London named 2012 Olympics host |date=[[2005-07-18]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>  In [[2012]], London will become the first city to have hosted the Games [[London Olympics|three times]].<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SPORT/07/06/singapore.olympics/index.html |title=London wins 2012 Olympics |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=[[2005-07-07]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>

After an evaluation of all nine of the applicant cities, the top five progressed to the shortlist. London won the bidding process to host the Olympics in a 4-round vote of the [[International Olympic Committee]] on [[July 6]], [[2005]] at the [[117th IOC Session]] held in [[Singapore]]. Paris was considered the frontrunner for most of the campaign,<ref name="BBC frontrunner">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/front_page/4655555.stm |title=London beats Paris to 2012 Games |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-07-06]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> and last minute lobbying is considered one of the factors that led to its win of the bid.<ref name="CNN" />  Madrid was also a favored candidate but failed, in the end, to surpass Paris and London.<ref name="Spain">{{cite news |url=http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/2228 |title=Spain bids for 2012 Olympics |publisher=ThinkSpain |date=[[2004-01-15]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>

==Bidding process==
<!-- Right here should be an overview of a normal bidding process, and how this specific bid series followed (or deviated from) the normal process. Many/most people wouldn't know what the bidding process is, and nothing seems to mention that the IOC is in charge of the bid.-->
===Evaluation of applicant cities===
The deadline to submit an application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was [[15 July]] [[2003]]. All nine cities that submitted bids before that date also met the [[15 January]], [[2004]] deadline for the 50-page [[questionnaire]].  The committee gave a weighted average score to each city based on scores in eleven categories, such as [[finance]], [[security]], accommodation, past experience and [[transport]].  On [[2004-05-18]], the International Olympic Committee gave evalutions of the potential hosts:
*{{flagicon|France}} [[Paris]], [[France]] &ndash; scored 8.5 ([[Paris 2012 Olympic bid|bid details]])
*{{flagicon|Spain}} [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] &ndash; scored 8.3 ([[Madrid 2012 Olympic bid|bid details]])
*{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] &ndash; scored 7.6 ([[London 2012 Olympic bid|bid details]])
*{{flagicon|USA}} [[New York City]], [[United States]] &ndash; scored 7.5 ([[New York City 2012 Olympic bid|bid details]])
*{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] &ndash; scored 6.5 ([[Moscow 2012 Olympic bid|bid details]])
*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] &ndash; scored 6.0
*{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] &ndash; scored 5.1
*{{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] &ndash; scored 4.8
*{{flagicon|Cuba}} [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] &ndash; scored 3.6

The five highest-rated candidates were allowed to progress onto the next stage and were granted the right to use the [[Olympic flame]] and [[Olympic rings]] imagery in their campaign literature.

===Evaluation of candidate cities===
By [[19 November]] [[2004]] all five candidate cities had submitted their candidate file to the [[International Olympic Committee]].  The IOC inspection team visited the five candidate cities during [[February]] and [[March]] of 2005.  The Paris bid suffered two set-backs during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits and a report coming out that [[Guy Drut]], one of the key members of the Paris bid team and IOC member, would face charges over alleged corrupt political party finances.<ref name="wrongb">{{cite news |publisher = GamesBids|accessdate = 2005-03-09 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1110389129|title =  Day One Of Paris 2012 Inspection By IOC}}</ref>

On [[6 June]] [[2005]] the [[International Olympic Committee]] released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities.  Although these reports did not contain any scores or rankings, the evaluation report for [[Paris]] was considered the most positive, now followed closely by [[London]] which had narrowed down most of the gap observed at the time of the evaluation of the applicant cities in [[2004]].  Also [[New York]] and [[Madrid]] obtained very positive evaluation reports.<ref name="wrongc">{{cite news |publisher = GamesBids|accessdate = 2005-06-06 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1118060827|title =  Paris, London and New York Get Glowing IOC Reports}}</ref>  Moscow was considered the weakest bid and New York suffered a major set-back following the evaluation when local state authorities rejected the funding for the New York 2012 Olympic stadium on [[6 June]] [[2005]].<ref name="wrongd">{{cite news |publisher = GamesBids|accessdate = 2005-06-06 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1118096992|title =  Funding For New York 2012 Olympic Stadium Rejected}}</ref>  It took just a week for New York to come up with a plan B but that was considered too close to the final vote to restore its chances.

Throughout the process and up to the vote at the [[117th IOC Session]], Paris was widely seen as the favourite to win the nomination, particularly as this was its third bid in recent history.  Originally [[London]] was seen lagging [[Paris]] by considerable margin, however this started to improve with the appointment of [[Sebastian Coe]] as new head of London 2012 on [[19 May]] [[2004]].  In late [[August]] [[2004]] some reports started emerging predicting a [[London]] and [[Paris]] tie in the 2012 bid.<ref name="wronge">{{cite news |publisher = GamesBids|accessdate = 2004-08-31 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1093970849|title =  London And Paris Tie In 2012 Bid}}</ref>  In the final run-up to the [[117th IOC Session]], London and Paris appeared to be increasingly in a neck-to-neck race.  On [[1 July]] [[2005]] [[Jacques Rogge]], when asked who the winner would be, told the assembled press:  "I cannot predict it since I don<U+2019>t know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less".<ref name="Rogge quote">{{cite news |publisher = [[International Sailing Federation]] |accessdate = 2007-03-06 |url = http://www.sailing.org/default.asp?ID=j1lFh5uql|title =  Rogge Arrives in Singapore | date=[[2005-07-01]]}}</ref>

===Final selection process===
[[Image:117th_IOC_Session.gif|thumb|125px|right|A special type of hybrid [[orchid]] was bred to commemorate the IOC Session in Singapore. The flower is named Vanda IOC.]]<!-- FAIR USE of 117th_IOC_Session.gif: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:117th_IOC_Session.gif for rationale -->
The election occurred on [[2005-07-06]] at the [[Raffles City|Raffles City Convention Centre]] in [[Singapore]] during the [[117th IOC Session]] held in the same city.  The opening ceremony was held at the [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay]] and the guest of honour was the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], [[Lee Hsien Loong]] who officially opened the session. After that, it held a cultural performance of dance and songs - the theme was "[[One Voice, One Rhythm, One World]]".

At around 10:30, preliminary voting of the IOC eliminated Moscow, then New York, and finally Madrid as candidates. This left the contest between London and Paris. The IOC announced that they would release the final result at exactly 11:46. At 11:49 [[UTC]] on Wednesday, [[2005-07-06]], the [[London 2012 Olympic bid|London bid]] was formally announced as the winner by IOC president [[Jacques Rogge]].

The results of the final voting rounds were:

==Candidate city overview==
===London===
{{main|London 2012 Olympic bid}}
[[Image:London-2012-logo.svg|120px|left]]<!-- FAIR USE of London-2012-logo.svg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:London-2012-logo.svg for rationale -->
[[Image:London 2012 train.jpg|thumb|A [[London Underground]] train decorated to promote London's olympic bid.]]
After [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]] failed to deliver winning bids for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]], [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Olympic Games]], it was decided that only [[London]], with unparalleled international recognition and a population of 7.3 million, could possibly be given the chance to host a Summer Olympic Games.<ref name="BBC London">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4233055.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: London |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> The jewel of the London bid was the [[Lower Lea Valley]], the location slated to be transformed from a less desirable location into a world-class [[Olympic Park]] and Olympic Village. It will be connected via high-speed shuttle service dubbed the [[Olympic Javelin]] and existing transportation links, capable of transferring 240,000 people an hour.<ref name="Train">{{cite web |url=http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/44 |title=Stratford Olympic Park |date=[[2006-01-25]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> After the Games, the East London region will host one of Europe's largest urban parks created in decades and will be home to the Olympic Institute, a centre for sports medical centre and a place to study the Olympic ideals.<ref name="OMI">{{cite web |url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/OMI/home.aspx |title=Olympic Medical Institute |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> The bid called for substantial improvement of the [[London Underground]] system which will handle the Olympic crowds and more investment into new Olympic sites throughout London. Also, the bid committee proposed the [[2012 Summer Paralympics|London Paralympic Games]], which would be as important as the Olympic Games. London was considered by many to be second favourite for the bid after Paris, but last-minute intense lobbying by the bid team in Singapore probably swung the votes in their favour.

Following the success of the bid there were [[2012 Summer Olympic development|further developments and announcements]], including reactions to the security fears highlighted by the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].

===Paris===
{{main|Paris 2012 Olympic bid}}
[[image:Paris2012.png|120px|left]]<!-- FAIR USE of Paris2012.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Paris2012.png for rationale -->

[[Paris]], [[France]] was considered by many to be the favourite to become the host city of the 2012 Olympics, after losing out to [[Barcelona]] and [[Beijing]] for the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] and [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]]. Paris's plan was very compact, with the placement of several sports in the Northern and Western Clusters and the Olympic Village between the two clusters.<ref name="BBC Paris">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3092943.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: Paris |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> The plan had gained high technical merit due to the city's well-maintained transport system, ability to handle peak number of tourists with plentiful accommodation, and very high support among Parisians and the nation.  Paris also planned to build temporary venues for some sports that can be moved and re-used elsewhere after the Games (dubbed "pre-cycling"). Much of their infrastructure, like the [[Stade de France]], was already in place and the city had had much experience in hosting successful international sporting events, including the [[1998 World Cup]] and the [[2003 World Championships in Athletics]].<ref name="BBC Paris" /> Its rich cultural and Olympic heritage were also emphasised. These placed Paris in a very strong position.

===Madrid===
{{main|Madrid 2012 Olympic bid}}
[[image:Madrid2012.png|75px|left]]<!-- FAIR USE of Madrid2012.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Madrid2012.png for rationale -->
[[Image:RFY4.jpg|thumb|thumb|Madrid 2012's "Ready for you" campaign]]
[[Madrid]], the capital city of [[Spain]], beat its southern counterpart [[Seville]] to represent Spain on the international stage. Madrid presented an above average bid, with almost all sports contested in three clusters all within very close proximity of each other.<ref name="BBC Madrid">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3092939.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: Madrid |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> Several existing facilities ensured the low financing necessary to host the Olympics; new permanent sporting venues would have provided a lasting legacy to the city.<ref name="BBC Madrid" /> The transport infrastructure would have been able to accommodate the hundreds of thousands gathering in the capital, and this positive was coupled with the use of renewable energy and hydrogen vehicles. Madrid had also organised several high-quality European and world championships. The bid gained resounding support among the city and national population and was helped with the support of former IOC president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], who was lobbying votes for the Madrid team. Following the Evaluation Committee, which gave the concept generally high marks, Madrid emerged as a primary contender against London and Paris.

During the last stages of the final selection, then IOC member [[Prince Albert of Monaco]] questioned the security of Madrid, remembering the recent [[Al Qaeda]] [[Madrid train bombings|terrorist attacks]] which took place in this city on March 11, 2004, killing 191 people. The Spanish delegation found this remark especially offensive and regarded the final election of London over Madrid as a consequence of Albert's words. Coincidentally, the day after the announcement of London as the winning candidate to host the 2012 Olympic Games ([[2005-07-07]]), Al Qaeda attacked the [[public transport]] structure in the British capital [[London terrorist attacks|killing 56 people]].

===New York===
{{main|New York City 2012 Olympic bid}}
[[Image:NYC2012.png|95px|left]]<!-- FAIR USE of NYC2012.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:NYC2012.png for rationale -->
[[Image:NYC2012USCClock.jpg|thumb|A countdown clock on [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] showing time until selection. It was part of the Metronome monument and has since been reverted.]]
[[New York City]] was selected over [[San Francisco]] as the sentimental favorite during the United States competition in [[2002]]. The Olympic X Plan was the main concept proposed by the NYC2012 Bid team; two primary transportation lines would have strung the several individual clusters in [[Manhattan]], [[Queens]], and [[Brooklyn]] together.<ref name="BBC New York">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/olympics_2012/3092947.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: New York |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> By combining existing world-class facilities such as [[Madison Square Garden]], [[Yankee Stadium]], [[Central Park]], and the National Tennis Center with new venues like the Brooklyn Arena, Greenbelt Olympic Equestrian Park, and Olympic Regatta Center, the city hoped to show that it was worthy of holding an event of such magnitude. The city has plentiful accommodation and one of the strongest aspects of the bid was the city's ability to market itself throughout the world. At the heart of the X was to be the 4,400 room Olympic Village which would have provided spacious rooms well above the IOC benchmark. The bid was dealt a setback when New York State refused to approve the construction of the [[West Side Stadium]] which was to be a main venue for the Olympics, and hampered the bid in the short-run.<ref name="BBC New York" /> However, the New York bid was revived with the utilization of a new stadium, [[Citi Field]], as the primary venue for athletics and the ceremonies. New York was not seen as a front runner, and their chances in getting the games were hurt after [[Vancouver]] got the [[2010 Winter Olympics]].

===Moscow===
{{main|Moscow 2012 Olympic bid}}
[[image:Moscow2012.png|80px|left]]<!-- FAIR USE of Moscow2012.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Moscow2012.png for rationale -->
[[Image:Manezhnaya moscow 2012.jpg|160px|thumb|Manezhnaya Square in Moscow with the logo of the bid]]
[[Moscow]] represented [[Russia]] in the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The capital city's Olympic plans were built on top of the legacy created after the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. Moscow's River Plan called for every single competition to be staged within city limits, making this one of the most compact proposals ever.<ref name="BBC Moscow">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/3071399.stm |title=Rivals for 2012: Moscow |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |date=[[2005-06-08]] |accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> All existing venues would have been extensively renovated and more venues were to be constructed in time for the Olympics. A new, modern athletes village was to be constructed on the [[Moscow River]], which was the centerpiece and core of the city's Olympic bid. Despite the high support from the entire nation and invaluable experience, Moscow's bid suffered from a lack of accommodation and an older transport system which may not have been able to cope with the expected traffic from the Olympics.<ref name="BBC Moscow" />

==Controversies==
===French recriminations following vote===
The Paris 2012 delegation, lead by [[Bertrand Delano<U+00EB>]], argued that [[Tony Blair]] and the London 2012 delegation broke the rules established by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC).  Bertrand Delano<U+00EB> stated on [[10 July]] [[2005]]:  "They have not respected the rules established by the International Olympic Committee.  I do not say that they were flirting with the yellow line, I say that they crossed the yellow line".<ref name="wrongf">{{cite news |publisher = L'Expansion |accessdate = 2005-07-11 |url = http://www.lexpansion.com/art/134.0.133407.0.html|title = JO 2012: Delano<U+00EB> relance la pol<U+00E9>mique}}</ref>  Similar allegations were repeated by several members of the Paris 2012 delegation.  Probably the most controversial move by London 2012 was its initiative to offer incentive packages for participating athletes (including free flights, economical accommodations, food and vouchers for long distance calling) and immediately after announcing it, London 2012 withdrew it.  This U-turn was probably a result of [[Jacques Rogge]], President of the IOC, raising concerns because it could have started a "bidding war" if not withdrawn.  Paris 2012 also claimed that the lobbying by [[Tony Blair]] would have broken IOC rules.  This was strongly denied by Downing Street.  Neverthless, allegations about underhand tactics continued to be made by certain members of the Paris 2012 delegation until on [[4 August]] [[2005]] Jacques Rogge eliminated any further controversies by a clearly worded statement: "I made it very clear that, in my opinion, the competition was fair. It was conducted according to the rules that we have set out".<ref name="wrongg">{{cite news |publisher = GamesBids |accessdate = 2005-08-04 |url = http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1123175331|title = JO 2012: Rogge Calls 2012 Host City Competition "Fair"}}</ref>  The comments by [[Bertrand Delano<U+00EB>]] were also criticized by some other Parisian political leaders. [[Claude Goasguen]], Paris President of the [[UMP]] Party stated: "One cannot make such type of accusations without delivering any proof".

===Mistaken voting controversy===
In December 2005, some months after the bid process was over, [[Alex Gilady]], an IOC member, suggested that Madrid should have tied for second with Paris in the third round of voting, but didn't do so due to [[Lambis Nikolaou]] of [[Greece]] pressing the wrong button. He further postulated that if this had happened, Madrid would have beaten Paris in resulting run off ballot for second place, and gone on to beat London in the final round. However, [[Craig Reedie]], another IOC member, dismissed the claims, commenting that a claim that an unnamed member 'might' have done something which 'might' have brought about something else which 'might' have brought about a different result is 'the kind of tittle-tattle that happens after many an IOC vote'.<ref name="wrongh">{{cite news |publisher = News.com.au |accessdate = 2005-12-23 |url = http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,17649352-2,00.html |title = London Olympics 'a mistake' }}</ref><ref name="wrongi">{{cite news |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 2005-12-23 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/olympics_2012/4553116.stm |title =  'Voting error' gave London Games }}</ref>

At the end of December 2005, Lambis Nikolaou denied the claim: "All speculations regarding my role in the third round of candidate cities for 2012 are completely unfounded.  I declare that I did not vote during the third round as I had announced during the election in question."  The latter is indeed confirmed by the IOC voting numbers.  It also means that even if Nikolaou had voted for Madrid, it would have failed to beat Paris in the third voting round.  Gilady also apologised to  Nikolaou.<ref name="wrongj">{{cite news |publisher = Reuters, Tiscali |accessdate = 2005-12-28 |url = http://www.tiscali.co.uk/news/newswire.php/news/reuters/2005/12/28/topnews/iocmemberdeniesvotingblunder.html|title =  IOC member denies voting blunder }}</ref>

==Potential applicant cities==
Many other cities made bids to their [[National Olympic Committee]]s, but they were not put forward to the IOC or withdrew their nomination before they filed the necessary paperwork.<ref name="Gamesbids2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/bids/2012.shtml|title=2012 Summer Olympic Games Bids|accessdate=2007-03-06|publisher=[[GamesBids]]}}</ref>

In [[Africa]], [[Abuja]], [[Nigeria]]; [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]; and [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] all made bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. Had any of these cities won the bid, they would have been the first African city to host either the [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer]] or the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter]] [[Olympic Games|Olympics]].

In the Americans, only two [[South America]]n bids were contested. The [[Brazilian Olympic Committee]] chose to nominate [[Rio de Janeiro]] instead of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo (city)|S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. In [[Canada]], [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], was hopeful to gain hosting rights for 2012, but [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], also in Canada, won the bidding process for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]. It is considered extremely unlikely that any one country would be granted the privilege of hosting two consecutive games. 

In the [[United States]], [[New York City]] won the [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s bid but several other cities offered to bid. [[San Francisco, California]] was the city behind New York to be the nation's bid. The two other cities on the shortlist were [[Houston, Texas]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] (in cooperation with nearby [[Baltimore, Maryland]]). The USOC also received bids from [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; [[Dallas, Texas]]; [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]; [[Los Angeles, California]]; and [[Tampa, Florida]] (in cooperation with nearby [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]).

In [[Asia]], three other cities that were not put forward, but that were interested in holding the games, were [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[India]]; [[New Delhi]], India; and [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].

Several [[Europe]]an nations were also hopeful to gain their NOC's bid. [[Germany]] chose [[Leipzig]] as its nomination, but [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Stuttgart]] also suggested their willingness to host. Other European cities that made a request as bidding were [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]; [[Milan]], [[Italy]]; [[Rome]], [[Italy]]; [[Seville]], [[Spain]]; [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]; and [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].
