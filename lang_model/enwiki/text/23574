'''Moss Empires''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] company formed from the merger of the theatre empires owned by Sir [[Edward Moss]] and Sir [[Oswald Stoll]] in [[1898]]. This formed the largest British chain of [[Music hall]]s. The business was successful controlling 33 music halls, and by [[1905]], almost every sizeable town in [[Great Britain]] had an ''Empire'', or ''Coliseum'' theatre, run by Stoll, and many newly constructed and designed by [[Frank Matcham]]. The company withdrew from promoting Music hall in [[1960]], due to increasing competition from other entertainment media.

The first [[Royal Command Performance]] was held at the groups' London Palace Theatre in [[1912]]; with many subsequent performances being given at the [[London Palladium]]. In [[1945]] [[Val Parnell]] became managing director of Moss Empires.

The company continues as [[Really Useful Group|Really Useful Theatres]], formed from the merger of the [[Stoll Moss Group]] with [[Really Useful Group|RUG]] Theatres. They continue to manage seven theatres, the [[London Palladium]], [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace]], the [[New London Theatre|New London]], the [[Adelphi Theatre|Adelphi]], [[Her Majesty's Theatre|Her Majesty's]] and the [[Cambridge theatre]].
