{{Details2|History of Chelsea F.C.}}
[[Image: Chelsea_Team_1905.jpg|right|thumb|The first Chelsea team in September 1905.|250 px]]
Chelsea were founded on [[March 14]], [[1905]] at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on [[Fulham Road]], and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. The club's early years saw little success; the closest they came to winning a major trophy was reaching the [[FA Cup]] final in 1915, where they lost to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. Chelsea gained a reputation for signing big-name players<ref name="glanville">{{cite news |

Former [[England national football team|England]] centre-forward [[Ted Drake]] became manager in 1952 and proceeded to modernise the club. He removed the club's [[Chelsea pensioner]] crest, improved the youth set-up and training regime, rebuilt the side, and led Chelsea to their first major trophy success <U+2013> the League championship <U+2013> in [[1954-55 in English football|1954<U+2013>55]]. The following season saw [[UEFA]] create the [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions' Cup]], but after objections from [[The Football League]] and the [[Football Association|FA]] Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.<ref>{{cite news |

The 1960s saw the emergence of a talented young Chelsea side under manager [[Tommy Docherty]]. They challenged for honours throughout the decade, and endured several near-misses. They were on course for a treble of League, FA Cup and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] going into the final stages of the [[1964-65 in English football|1964-65]] season, winning the League Cup but faltering late on in the other two.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill, Rick | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography - The Definitive Story of the First 100 Years| publisher=Headline Book Publishing Ltd| year=2006| id=ISBN 0-7553-1466-2 | pages=p. 196}}</ref> In three seasons the side were beaten in three major semi-finals and were FA Cup runners-up.

Chelsea took their first European honour, a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] triumph, the following year, with another replayed win, this time over [[Real Madrid]] in [[Athens]].

The late 1970s and the 1980s were a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club,<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=pp. 84-87}}</ref> star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious [[hooliganism|hooligan]] element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=pp. 143-157}}</ref> Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by [[Ken Bates]] for the nominal sum of <U+00A3>1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=pp. 89-90}}</ref> On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] for the first time, but in 1983 manager [[John Neal (footballer)|John Neal]] put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in [[1983-84 in English football|1983<U+2013>84]] and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in [[1988-89 in English football|1988-89]].

After a long-running legal battle, Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=pp. 90-91}}</ref> Chelsea's form in the new [[Premier League]] was unconvincing, although they did reach the FA Cup final in [[FA Cup Final 1994|1994]]. It was not until the appointment of former [[European Footballer of the Year]] [[Ruud Gullit]] as [[player-manager]] in 1996 that their fortunes changed. He added several top-class international players to the side, particularly [[Gianfranco Zola]], as the club won the [[FA Cup]] in [[FA Cup Final 1997|1997]] and established themselves as one of England's top sides again. Gullit was replaced by [[Gianluca Vialli]], who led the team to victory in the [[Football League Cup Final 1998|League Cup]] and the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1997-98|Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1998, the FA Cup in [[FA Cup Final 2000|2000]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] quarter-finals in 2000. Vialli was sacked in favour of another Italian, [[Claudio Ranieri]], who guided Chelsea to the 2002 [[FA Cup]] final and Champions League qualification in  [[2002-03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03]]. 

In June 2003, Bates sold Chelsea to [[Russia|Russian]] billionaire [[Roman Abramovich]] for <U+00A3>140 million, completing what was then the biggest-ever sale of an English football club.<ref name="takeover"/> Owing to Abramovich's Russian heritage, the club were soon popularly dubbed "Chelski" in the British media.<ref>{{cite news |

{{details|Stamford Bridge (stadium)}}

Chelsea have only ever had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since foundation. It was officially opened on [[28 April]] [[1877]]. For the first 28 years of its existence it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletics Club as an arena for [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]] meetings and not at all for football. 
In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman [[Gus Mears]] and his brother, J T Mears, who had previously acquired additional land (formerly a large [[market garden]]) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5 acre (51,000 m<U+00B2>) site.<ref name="stadium">{{cite web |

Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect [[Archibald Leitch]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=pp. 69-71}}</ref> They offered the stadium to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham Football Club]], but the offer was turned down. As a consequence, the owners decided to form their own football club to occupy their new ground. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge. Since there was already a football club named Fulham in the borough, the founders decided to adopt the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea for the new club, having rejected names such as ''Kensington FC'', ''Stamford Bridge FC'' and ''London FC''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=p. 55}}</ref>

Starting with an open bowl-like design and one covered terrace, Stamford Bridge had an original capacity of around 100,000.<ref name="stadium">{{cite web |

It eventually became known as the "Shed End", the home of Chelsea's most loyal and vocal supporters, particularly during the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exact origins of the name are unclear, but the fact that the roof looked like a [[corrugated iron]] shed roof played a part.<ref name="stadium">{{cite web |

Work began on the East Stand in the early 1970s but the cost almost brought the club to its knees, and the [[Fee simple|freehold]] was sold to [[Real estate developer|property developers]]. Following a long legal battle, it was not until the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed.<ref name="stadium">When Stamford Bridge was nearly no more</ref> The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and moved closer to the pitch, a process completed by 2001.

The Stamford Bridge [[Football pitch|pitch]], the freehold, the turnstiles and Chelsea's [[naming rights]] are now owned by [[Chelsea Pitch Owners]], a non-profit organisation in which fans are the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. It also means that if someone tries to move the football club to a new stadium they could not use the Chelsea FC name.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=pp. 91-92}}</ref> 

The club plans to increase its capacity to over 50,000. Owing to its location in a built-up part of London on a main road and next to two [[railway]] lines, fans can only enter the stadium through the [[Fulham Road]] entrance, which places severe constraints on expansion due to [[health and safety]] regulations.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill | year=2006 | title=Chelsea FC: The Official Biography | pages=p. 76 }}</ref>  As a result, Chelsea have been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge to sites including the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre]], [[Battersea Power Station]] and the [[Chelsea Barracks]].<ref>{{cite news

[[Image:vilogo.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Centenary club crest.]]
Since the club's foundation, Chelsea have had four main crests, though all underwent minor variations. In 1905, Chelsea adopted as their first crest the image of a [[Chelsea pensioner]], which obviously contributed to the "pensioner" nickname, and remained for the next half-century, though it never appeared on the shirts. As part of [[Ted Drake]]'s modernisation of the club from 1952 onwards, he insisted that the pensioner badge be removed from the match day programme in order to change the club's image and that a new crest be adopted.<ref name="crests">{{cite web |

This was the first club badge to appear on shirts, since the policy of putting the crest on the shirts was only adopted in the early 1960s.<ref name="crests"/>
 
In 1986, with new owners now at the club, Chelsea's crest was changed again as part of another attempt to modernise and to capitalise on new marketing opportunities.<ref name="crests"/> The new badge featured a more naturalistic non-heraldic lion, yellow and not blue, standing over the C.F.C. initials. It lasted for the next 19 years, with some modifications such as the use of different colours. With new ownership, and the club's [[centenary]] approaching, combined with demands from fans for the club's traditional badge to be restored, it was decided that the crest should be changed again in 2004. The new crest was officially adopted for the start of the [[2005-06 in English football|2005-06]] season and marks a return to the older design of the blue heraldic lion holding a staff.<ref name="new crest"/> As with previous crests, this one has appeared in various colours, including white and gold.

Chelsea have always worn blue shirts, although they initially adopted a lighter shade than the current version, and unlike today wore white shorts and dark blue socks. The lighter blue was taken from the racing colours of then club president, [[Earl Cadogan]]. The light blue shirts were short-lived, however, and replaced by a royal blue version in around 1912.<ref>{{cite book | author=Glanvill, Rick | title=Chelsea Football Club: The Official History in Pictures| year=2006| id=ISBN 0-75531-467-0}} p.212</ref> When [[Tommy Docherty]] became manager in the early 1960s he changed the kit again, adding blue shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the [[1964-65 in English football|1964<U+2013>65]] season.<ref>{{cite book | author=Mears, Brian | title=Chelsea: Football Under the Blue Flag| publisher=Mainstream Sport| year=2002| id=ISBN 1-84018-658-5 | pages=p.42 }}</ref>
 
Chelsea's traditional away colours are all yellow or all white with blue trim, but, as with most teams, they have had some more unusual ones.

Chelsea also launched a European kit which consists of black shirts, shorts and socks. 

Chelsea's kit is currently manufactured by [[Adidas]], which is contracted to supply the club's kit from 2006 to 2011. Their previous kit manufacturer was [[Umbro]].

Chelsea do not have an obvious rivalry, in the manner that [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], or [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] do.
