'''Lynn Curtis Swann''' (b. [[March 7]], [[1952]], [[Alcoa, Tennessee|Alcoa]], [[Tennessee]]) is a former professional [[American football|football]] player, sports broadcaster and a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician. As a youth, Swann went to [[Jun<U+00ED>pero Serra High School]] in [[San Mateo, California]], later attended the [[University of Southern California]], and completed a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Public Relations from the USC School of Journalism. His nickname is "Swanny."

Swann is married to Charena Swann, a [[psychologist]], and has two sons.

==Football career==
Swann was an outstanding WR, an [[All-America]]n at the University of Southern California, and was selected by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with the 21st pick of the first round in the [[1974 NFL Draft]].  Swann is best known for his play as a [[wide receiver]] from 1974 to [[1982 in sports|1982]] with the Steelers, the only team for which he played. 

Although Swann never recorded more then 880 receiving yards in a single season, his superb catching ability and clutch performance was vital to the Steelers' success in the [[1970s]].  He complemented his fellow receiver [[John Stallworth]], who ended his career as the Steelers' all-time leading receiver.

As a rookie, Swann led the NFL with 577 punt return yards, a franchise record and the fourth most in NFL history at the time.  He went on to win a championship ring with the Steelers in [[Super Bowl IX]] but did not record any receptions in the tough defensive struggle (Pittsburgh quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] completed only nine passes in the game).  However, he had a good performance on special teams, returning 3 punts for 34 yards.

The following season became the highlight of Swann's career.  He caught 49 passes for 781 yards and a league-leading 11 touchdowns.  In the AFC title game against the [[Oakland Raiders]] he suffered a severe concussion that forced him to spend two days in a hospital, but surprised many by returning to play for [[Super Bowl X]].  Swann recorded four catches for a Super Bowl record 161 yards and a touchdown in the game, assisting the Steelers to a 21-17 win and becoming the first wide receiver to earn [[Super Bowl MVP]] honors.

Two seasons later, the Steelers made it to [[Super Bowl XIII]], and Swann once again had an outstanding performance.  He caught seven passes for 124 yards and scored the final touchdown for Pittsburgh in their 35-31 win over the [[Dallas Cowboys]], their Super Bowl opponent for the second time during the decade.  The Steelers made it back to the Super Bowl again in the [[1979 in sports|1979]] season, and for the third time, Swann was a key component in the Steelers' win.  He caught five passes for 79 yards and a touchdown in Pittsburgh's 31-19 win in [[Super Bowl XIV]].  Overall, Swann gained 364 receiving yards and 398 all-purpose yards in his three [[Super Bowl]]s, which were both Super Bowl records at the time.

Swann retired after the 1982 season with 336 career receptions for 5,462 yards and 51 touchdowns.  He also rushed for 72 yards and gained 739 yards and a touchdown on punt returns.  Swann was a [[pro bowl]] selection three times (1975, 1977, 1978) and was selected on the [[1970s]] all-decade team.

Swann was elected to the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in [[1993 in sports|1993]].  Though his professional career didn't yield large statistics, Swann was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in [[2001 in sports|2001]].  He was also selected to the [[NFL 1970s All-Decade Team]] by Hall of Fame voters.

==Post-football career==
Swann is the former Chairman of the United States [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]] and serves as a director on the boards of [[Heinz|H J Heinz Co.]] and [[Wyndham International]]. He has been a football and sports broadcaster for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Sports]] since [[1976]] but left to run an unsuccessful bid for Pennsylvania governor. Swann also briefly hosted the [[television]] [[game show]] ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', on which he had previously appeared as a panelist, on [[NBC]] from [[1990]] to [[1991]]. His fourteen-week run as emcee met with critical disdain, and he was replaced by [[Alex Trebek]].

==2006 candidacy for governor==
{{main|Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2006}}
In December 2004, Swann, who resides in the [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[Sewickley Heights, Pennsylvania]], indicated that he was considering seeking the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] in the [[Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]]. On [[February 23]], [[2005]], Swann filed papers with the state elections board stating his intention to run.  On the same day he formed a fundraising committee called ''Team 88'' after his Steeler jersey number.  On [[January 4]], [[2006]], Swann formally declared his candidacy for Governor of Pennsylvania.

Swann's opponents in the Republican [[primary election|primary]] scheduled for [[May 16]], [[2006]] had initially included Jim Panyard, [[Pennsylvania Senate|Pennsylvania State Senator]] [[Jeff Piccola]], and former Pennsylvania [[Lieutenant governor|Lt. Governor]] [[William W. Scranton, III]].  After Swann received the endorsement of the Republican state committee on [[February 11]], [[2006]], all three opponents quit the race, leaving Swann as the only Republican to have filed by the deadline of March 7, 2006.  Swann's campaign focused mainly on property tax reform.  He also supported giving the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] Pittsburgh's lone slots license so they could build a new [[arena]], free of taxpayer money. 

In the end, Swann lost the election with 40% of the vote to incumbent [[Ed Rendell]]'s 60%. Had Swann won, he would have been the first challenger in Pennsylvania history to unseat an incumbent governor, as well as the first African-American governor of [[Pennsylvania]] and only the third African-American governor of a state in U.S. history. Of the three African American gubernatorial candidates in 2006, only one ([[Massachusetts]]' [[Deval Patrick]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]) won; [[Kenneth Blackwell]], a Republican, lost in Ohio.

An amusing photo of Swann briefly playing [[beer pong]] while on the campaign trail was circulated on the internet in October of 2006. [http://mondesishouse.blogspot.com/2006/10/future-governor-lynn-swann-plays-beer.html] Swann was walking through the parking lot prior to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] vs. [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] preseason game in August 2006 and was coerced into briefly playing the game. The photo and accompanying story was picked up by several national news agencies and prominent websites.
