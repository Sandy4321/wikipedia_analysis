'''Cafestol''' is a [[diterpene]] [[molecule]] present in [[coffee]].

A typical bean of ''[[Coffea arabica]]'' contains about 0.6% cafestol by weight. Cafestol is present in highest quantity in unfiltered coffee drinks such as [[French press]] coffee or [[Turkish coffee]]. In filtered coffee drinks such as [[drip brew]]ed coffee, it is present in only negligible amounts.

Studies have shown that regular consumption of boiled coffee increases serum cholesterol by 8% in men and 10% in women.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} For those drinking filter coffee, the effect was only significant for women.

Cafestol has also shown [[anticarcinogen]]ic properties in rats. 

According to a 2005 study by the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], cafestol may act as an [[agonist]] [[ligand]] for the genes [[FXR]] and [[PXR]], blocking cholesterol [[homeostasis]].
