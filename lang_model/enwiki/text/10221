'''''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets''''' is the second instalment in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series written by [[J. K. Rowling]]. During Harry's second year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] a series of messages on the walls on the school's corridors warn that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened and that the "heir of Slytherin" will kill all pupils whose parents are not both magical. These threats are followed by attacks which leave residents of the school petrified. Throughout the year, Harry and his friends [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] investigate the attacks, and Harry is confronted by [[Lord Voldemort]] in an attempt to regain full power. 

The book was published in the UK on 2&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998 by [[Bloomsbury Publishing Plc|Bloomsbury]] and in the US on 2&nbsp;June&nbsp;1999 by [[Scholastic Inc]]. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise from critics and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character is the result of the person's choices.

Commentators noted that personal identity is a strong theme, highlighted in Harry's questions about himself and in the concealment of idenity by Tom Riddle and by the vain, dishonest and cowardly celebrity [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. Opposition to [[racism]] is exemplified by Harry's considerate treatment of various non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Harry and Ron show little regard for rules, and Dumbledore endorses their actions because thay saved the school. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent.

The film version of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', released in 2002,  became the third film to exceed $600 million in international box office sales and received generally favourable reviews. However, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' won the [[Saturn Award]] for the Best Fantasy Film. Video games loosely based on ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.

==Synopsis==
===Background===
When [[Harry Potter]] was a baby, [[Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]], the most powerful evil wizard in living memory, killed Harry's parents but mysteriously vanished after trying to kill Harry. Harry is placed in the care of his [[Muggle]] (non-magical) relatives [[Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]] and [[Uncle Vernon|Vernon Dursley]]. Although his aunt and uncle loathe anything connected with magic, the simple fact that they are Harry's close relatives protects him from Voldemort's supporters while he is growing up. Harry enters the wizarding world at the age of 11, enrolling in the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. There he makes friends with [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]].

===Plot summary===
Soon after the start of Harry's second session at Hogwarts, messages on the walls of the corridors say that the mythical Chamber of Secrets has been re-opened and that the "Heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils whose parents are not both magical&nbsp;<U+2013> which includes Hermione. At intervals various inhabitants of the school are found petrified in corridors. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover [[Moaning Myrtle]], the ghost of a girl who was killed the last time the Chamber was opened, and who now haunts the girls' toilet in which she died. Myrtle shows Harry a diary bearing the name "Tom Marvolo Riddle". Although its pages are blank, it responds when Harry writes in it. Eventually the book shows him Hogwarts as it was 50&nbsp;years ago, just after Myrtle's death. There he sees Tom Riddle, a pupil at the time, pin the blame for Myrtle's death on [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], who was then 13&nbsp;years old and already devoted to keeping dangerous magical creatures as pets.

Four months later, the diary is stolen, and shortly afterwards Hermione is petrified. However, she holds a note explaining that the culprit is a [[basilisk]], a huge serpent whose gaze kills those who look into its eyes directly but only petrifies those who look into them by means of a reflecting surface, such as water or a mirror. Hermione concluded that the monster travels through the school's pipes and emerges through the toilet Myrtle haunts. As the attacks continue, [[Cornelius Fudge]], the [[Minister for Magic (Harry Potter)|Minister for Magic]], holds Hagrid in the wizards' prison as a precaution. [[Lucius Malfoy]], a former supporter of Voldemort who claims to have reformed, then announces that the school's governors have suspended Dumbledore from the position of headmaster.

After Ron's younger sister [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] is abducted into the Chamber, the staff insist that the [[Dark arts (Harry Potter)|Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], should handle the situation. However, when Harry and Ron go to his office to tell him what they have discovered about the basilisk, Lockhart reveals that he is a fraud who took credit for the accomplishments of others and attempts to erase the boys' memories. Disarming Lockhart, they march him to Moaning Myrtle's toilet, where Harry opens the passage to the Chamber of Secrets. In the sewers under the school, Lockhart grabs Ron's wand and tries again to wipe the boys' memories&nbsp;<U+2013> but Ron's wand had been damaged in an accident at the start of the school year and the spell backfires, inflicting total [[amnesia]] on Lockhart, collapsing part of the tunnel and separating Harry from Ron and Lockhart.

While Ron attempts to tunnel through the rubble, Harry enters the Chamber of Secrets, where Ginny lies beside the diary. As he examines her, Tom Riddle appears, looking exactly as he did 50&nbsp;years ago, and explains that he is a memory stored in the diary. Ginny wrote in it about her adolescent hopes and fears, and Riddle won her confidence by appearing sympathetic, possessed her, and used her to open the Chamber. Riddle also reveals that he is [[Voldemort]] as a boy. He further explains that he learned from Ginny who Harry was and about his own deeds as Voldemort. When Ginny realised that she had been responsible for the attacks, she attempted to throw the diary away, and it came into Harry's possession. Riddle then releases the basilisk to kill Harry. Dumbledore's pet [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], Fawkes, brings a magnificent sword wrapped in the [[Sorting Hat]]. Harry uses the sword to kill the basilisk&nbsp;<U+2013> but only after being bitten by the creature's venomous fangs, one of which breaks off. As Riddle gloats over the dying Harry, Fawkes cures him with its tears. Harry stabs the diary with the broken fang, and Riddle screams and vanishes.<ref>This is the sequence in the book; see {{cite book|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|date=1998|pages=236-237|isbn=0747538484}}.

Fawkes airlifts all four out of the tunnels.

Harry recounts the whole story to Dumbledore, who has been reinstated. The headmaster revokes his threat to expel the boys if they broke more rules and gives them special awards for services to the school. When Harry mentions his earlier fears that he was the Heir of Slytherin, Dumbledore says that Harry ''chose'' Gryffindor House, and only a true member of that House could have used [[Godric Gryffindor]]'s sword to kill the basilisk. Lucius Malfoy bursts in, and Harry accuses him of slipping the diary into one of Ginny's books while all the pupils were shopping for school books. Malfoy replies, "Prove it." Finally, all of the basilisk's petrified victims are revived by a potion, the preparation of which has taken several months.

==Publication and reception==
===Development===
Rowling found it difficult to finish ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' because she was afraid it would not live up to the expectations raised by ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]''. After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.<ref name="Sexton2007JKR">{{cite book

In early drafts of the book, the ghost [[Nearly Headless Nick]] sang a self-composed song explaining his condition and the circumstances of his death. This was cut as the book's editor did not care for the poem, which has been subsequently published as an extra on J. K. Rowling's official website.<ref>{{cite web

===Critical response===
In ''[[The Times]]'', Deborah Loudon described ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' as a children's book that would be "re-read into adulthood" and highlighted its "strong plots, engaging characters, excellent jokes and a moral message which flows naturally from the story".<ref name="Loudon1998ReviewHPCSInTimes">{{cite journal|last= Loudon |first=Deborah|date=September 18, 1998 |title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets <U+2014> Children's Books|journal=[[The Times]]|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/children/article778375.ece|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> Fantasy author [[Charles de Lint]] agreed, and considered the second Harry Potter book as good as ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', a rare achievement among series of books.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=|url=http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2000/cdl0001.htm|title=Books To Look For|last=de Lint|first=Charles|date=January 2000  |accessdate=2009-05-26|publisher=Fantasy & Science Fiction}}</ref> Thomas Wagner regarded the plot as very similar to that of the first book, based on searching for a secret hidden under the school. However, he enjoyed the parody of celebrities and their fans that centres round Gilderoy Lockhart, and approved of the book's handling of [[racism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfreviews.net/harrypotter2.html|title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|last=Wagner|first=Thomas|date=2000 |accessdate=2009-05-26|publisher=Thomas M. Wagner}}</ref> Tammy Nezol found the book more disturbing than its predecessor, particularly in the rash behaviour of Harry and his friends after Harry withholds information from Dumbledore, and in the human-like behaviour of the [[Mandrake (plant)|mandrake]]s used to make a potion that cures [[petrification]]. Neverthelesss she considered the second story as enjoyable as the first.<ref name="NezolReviewAbout">{{cite web|url=http://contemporarylit.about.com/od/fantasy/fr/harryPotter2.htm|title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter 2)|last=Nezol|first=Tammy|publisher=About.com|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref>

Mary Stuart thought the final conflict with Tom Riddle in the Chamber was almost as scary as in some of [[Stephen King]]'s works, and perhaps too strong for young or timid children. She commented that "there are enough surprises and imaginative details thrown in as would normally fill five lesser books." Like other reviewers, she thought the book would give pleasure to both children and adult readers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curledup.com/chamber.htm|title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|last=Stuart|first=Mary|publisher=curledup.com|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> According to [[Philip Nel]], the early reviews gave unalloyed praise while the later ones included some criticisms, although they still agreed that the book was outstanding.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nel|first=Phillip|title=J.K.

Writing after all seven books had been published, [[Graeme Davis (mediaevalist)|Graeme Davis]] regarded ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' as the weakest of the series, and agreed that the plot structure is much the same as in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. He described Fawkes' appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a ''[[deus ex machina]]'': the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes' timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been fatal to Harry and Ginny.<ref name="bad">{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Graeme|title=Re-Read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Today! an Unauthorized Guide|publisher=Nimble Books LLC|date=2008|page=1|chapter=Re-reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|isbn=1934840726|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mrvPPS5DXBEC&pg=PA2&dq=%22Harry+Potter+and+the+Chamber+of+Secrets%22&lr=#PPA1,M1|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>

Dave Kopel describes the climactic scene in which Harry saves Ginny from Riddle's diary and the basilisk as ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' for a new audience: "Harry descends to a deep underworld, is confronted by two Satanic minions (Voldemort and a giant serpent), is saved from certain death by his faith in Dumbledore (the bearded God the Father/Ancient of Days), rescues the virgin (<!-- Do NOT alter this quote. --->Ginerva<!-- Do NOT alter this quote.--> [sic] Weasley), and ascends in triumph."<ref>{{cite web|title=Deconstructing Rowling|author=Dave Kopel|work=National Review|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel062003.asp|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>

===Religious response===
{{main|Religious debates over the Harry Potter series}}
Religious controversy surrounding ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of the Secrets'' and the other books in the [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter series]] mainly deal with claims that the novel contains [[occult]] or [[Satanic]] subtexts.  Religious response to the series has not been exclusively negative, however, and several religious groups have spoken in defense of the moralistic themes found in the book. The [[American Library Association]] even placed the series atop the "most challenged books" list for 1999<U+2013>2001.<ref name="Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP">{{cite journal|last=Knapp|first=Nancy|date=2003|title=In Defense of Harry Potter: An Apologia|journal=School Libraries Worldwide|publisher=International Association of School Librarianship|volume=9|issue=1|pages=78-91|url=http://www.iasl-online.org/files/jan03-knapp.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2009}}</ref>

The Orthodox churches of [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]] have campaigned against the series,<ref name=bulgaria>{{cite web|title=Bulgarian church warns against the spell of Harry Potter|author=Clive Leviev-Sawyer|work=Ecumenica News International|url=http://www.eni.ch/articles/display.shtml?04-0394|year=2004|accessdate=15&nbsp;June 2007}}</ref><ref name=thrace>{{cite web|title=Church: Harry Potter film a font of evil|work=Kathimerini|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100021_14/01/2003_25190|year=2003|accessdate=15&nbsp; June 2007}}</ref> and in the United States, calls for the book to be banned from schools have led to legal challenges.  Most of these are held on the grounds that [[witchcraft]] is a government-recognised religion and that to allow the novels to be held in public schools violates the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]].<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|title=Next installment of mom vs. Potter set for Gwinnett court|author=Ben Smith|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070601155533/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/gwinnett/stories/2007/05/28/0529metPOTTER.html|year=2007|accessdate=8 June 2007}}</ref><ref name=mallory1>{{citeweb|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15127464/ |title=Georgia mom seeks Harry Potter ban|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date = 4&nbsp;October 2006}}</ref><ref name=mallory2>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Appeal Update|author=Laura Mallory|url=http://www.hisvoicetoday.org/hpappeal.htm|year=2007|accessdate=16&nbsp;May 2007|publisher=HisVoiceToday.org}}</ref>

Some religious responses have been positive. Emily Griesinger wrote that fantasy literature helps children to survive reality for long enough to learn how to deal with it, described Harry's first passage through to [[Platform 9<U+00BE>]] as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes. She noted that the self-sacrifice of Harry's mother, which protected the boy in the first book and throughout the series, was the most powerful of the "deeper magics" that transcend the magical "technology" of the wizards, and one which the power-hungry [[Voldemort]] fails to understand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Griesinger|first=Emily|date=2002|title=Harry Potter and the "deeper magic": narrating hope in children's literature|journal=Christianity and Literature|volume=51|issue=3|pages=455-480|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb049/is_3_51/ai_n28919307/|accessdate=15 May 2009}}</ref> ''[[Christianity Today]]'' published an editorial in favor of the books in January 2000, calling the series a "Book of Virtues" and averring that although "<nowiki>m</nowiki>odern witchcraft is indeed an ensnaring, seductive false religion that we must protect our children from", the Harry Potter books represent "wonderful examples of compassion, loyalty, courage, friendship, and even self-sacrifice".<ref>Editorial (January 10, 2000).

==Themes==
''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' continues the examination of what makes a person who he or she is, which began in the first book. As well as maintaining that Harry's identity is shaped by his decisions rather than any aspect of his birth,<ref name="NezolReviewAbout" /><ref name="Jacobsen2004SecularCity" />''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' provides contrasting characters who try to conceal their true personalities: as Tammy Nezol puts it, Gilderoy Lockhart "lacks any real identity" because he is nothing more than a charming liar.<ref name="NezolReviewAbout" /> Riddle also complicates Harry's struggle to understand himself by pointing out the similarities between the two: "both half-bloods, orphans raised by [[Muggle]]s, probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin."<ref name="Cockrell2004SecretPassword"> {{cite book

Opposition to [[Social class|class]], prejudice, and [[racism]] is a constant theme of the series. In ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' Harry's consideration and respect for others extends to the lowly, non-human [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]] and the ghost Nearly Headless Nick.<ref name="Knapp2003InDefenseOfHP" /> According to Marguerite Krause, achievements in the novel depend more on ingenuity and hard work than on natural talents.<ref name="Krause2006EndOfReligion">{{cite book|last=Krause|first=Marguerite|title=Mapping the world of Harry Potter|editor=Lackey, M., and Wilson, L.|publisher=BenBella Books|date=2006|pages=55-63|chapter=Harry Potter and the End of Religion|isbn=1932100598|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sKRkzVIK3foC&pg=PT12&dq=%22Harry+Potter+and+the+Chamber+of+Secrets%22&lr=#PPT24,M1|accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref>

Edward Duffy, an associate professor at [[Marquette University]], says that one of the central characters of ''Chamber of Secrets'' is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley <U+2013> just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas.<ref name="Duffy2002SentencesInHP">{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Edward|date=2002|title=Sentences in Harry Potter, Students in Future Writing Classes|journal=Rhetoric Review,|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|volume=21|issue=2|pages=170<U+2013>187|url=http://wrt-brooke.syr.edu/courses/205.03/rrhp.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref> Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an [[instant messaging]] or [[chat room]] system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Bronwyn|coauthors=Zenger, Amy|others=A.A.|title=Popular culture and representations of literacy|publisher=Routledge|date=2007|pages=113-117, 119-121|isbn=0415360951|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DDvbNnO4OH8C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=%22chamber+of+secrets%22+riddle+identity&source=bl&ots=hGxQvO6Gfd&sig=NQxNU0b5bc4AynQ5LU1jjtrAZeo&hl=en&ei=L1wdSq_ZA8-TjAeXytCPDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA121,M1|accessdate=2009-05-27|language=WilliamsZenger2007Literacy}}</ref>

Immorality and the portrayal of authority as negative are significant themes in the novel. Marguerite Krause states that there are few absolute moral rules in Harry Potter's world, for example Harry prefers to tell the truth, but lies whenever he considers it necessary&nbsp;<U+2013> very like his enemy [[Draco Malfoy]].<ref name="Krause2006EndOfReligion" /> At the end of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'', Dumbledore retracts his promise to punish Harry, Ron, and Hermione if they break any more school rules <U+2013> after [[Professor McGonagall]] estimates that they have broken over 100&nbsp;<U+2013> and lavishly rewards them for ending the threat from the Chamber of Secrets.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|title=Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|date=1998|isbn=0747538484| chapter=Dobby's Reward | pages=241-243}}</ref> Krause further states that authority figures and political institutions receive little respect from Rowling.<ref name="Krause2006EndOfReligion" /> William MacNeil of the [[University of California]] states that  the [[Minister for Magic]] is presented as a mediocrity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacNeil|first=William|date=2002|title="Kidlit" as "Law-And-Lit": Harry Potter and the Scales of Justice|journal=Law and Literature|publisher=University of California|volume=14|issue=3|pages=545<U+2013>564|url=http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/10072/6871/1/21489.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-27|doi=10.1525/lal.2002.14.3.545}}</ref> In his article "Harry Potter And The Secular City", Ken Jacobson suggests that the [[Ministry for Magic|Ministry]] as a whole is portrayed as a tangle of bureacratic empires, saying that "Ministry officials busy themselves with minutiae (e.g. standardizing cauldron thicknesses) and coin politically

===Connection to ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince''===
''Chamber of Secrets'' has many links with the sixth book of the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''. In fact, ''Half-Blood Prince'' was the working title of ''Chamber of Secrets'' and Rowling says she originally intended to present some "crucial pieces of information" in the second book, but ultimately felt that "this information's proper home was book six".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=77|title=Title of Book Six: The Truth|last=Rowling|first=J.K.|date=29 June 2004|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref> Some objects that play significant roles in ''Half-Blood Prince'' first appear in ''Chamber of Secrets'': the [[Hand of Glory]] and the opal necklace that are on sale in [[Borgin and Burkes]]; a Vanishing Cabinet in Hogwarts that is damaged by [[Peeves|Peeves the Poltergeist]]; and [[Tom Riddle's diary]], which is later shown to be a [[Horcrux]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Graeme|title=Re-Read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Today! an Unauthorized Guide|publisher=Nimble Books LLC|date=2008|page=74|chapter=Re-reading The Very Secret Diary|isbn=1934840726|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mrvPPS5DXBEC&pg=PA74&dq=%22Chamber+of+Secrets%22+%22Half-Blood+Prince%22+horcrux|accessdate=2009-05-25}}</ref>
