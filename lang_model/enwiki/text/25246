==Locating bin Laden==
{{See also|Location of Osama bin Laden}}

The U.S. intelligence community effort to determine the current location of Osama bin Laden, which eventually resulted in the Abbottabad operation, began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002, resulting in years of consequent investigation, followed by intensive multiplatform surveillance on the compound beginning in September 2010.

===Identity of his courier===
Identification of al-Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA [[black site]]s and [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al-Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders.<ref name="phonecall"/> Bin Laden was known not to use phones, as the U.S. launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998 ([[Cruise missile strikes on Afghanistan and Sudan (August 1998)|Operation Infinite Reach]]) after tracking an associate's satellite phone.<ref>{{cite news| title=Tracking use of bin Laden's satellite phone| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/05/28/tracking-use-of-bin-ladens-satellite-phone/ | date=May 28, 2008 | accessdate=May 8, 2011 | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>

By 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al-Qaeda courier with the [[nom de guerre]] [[Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti]] (sometimes referred to as [[Sheikh]] Abu Ahmed from Kuwait).<ref name="phonecall"/> In 2003, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], the alleged operational chief of al-Qaeda, revealed under interrogation that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti but that he was not active in al-Qaeda.<ref name="torture">{{cite news |title=Bin Laden Raid Revives Debate on Value of Torture |first=Scott |last=Shane |last2=Savage | first2=Charlie |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/us/politics/04torture.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref>

In 2004, a prisoner named [[Hassan Ghul]] told interrogators that al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor [[Abu Faraj al-Libi]]. Ghul further revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Khalid Sheik Mohammed maintained his original story.<ref name="torture"/> Abu Faraj al-Libi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guant<U+00E1>namo in September 2006.<ref name="miamifaraj"/> He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that he was part of bin Laden's inner circle.<ref name="torture"/>

In 2007, officials learned al-Kuwaiti's real name,<ref name="realname">{{cite web |title=Osama Bin Laden: Navy SEALS Operation Details of Raid That Killed 9/11 Al Qaeda Leader |author=Brian Ross |coauthors=Matthew Cole, Avni Patel |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/khalid-sheikh-muhammad-capture-osama-bin-laden-courier/story?id=13506413 |work=ABC News |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> though they will not disclose the name nor how they learned it.<ref name="torture"/> Since the name Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan appears in the JTF-GTMO detainee assessment for Abu Faraj al-Libi released by [[WikiLeaks]] on April 24, 2011,<ref name="wikileaksfaraj"/> there was speculation that the U.S. assault on the Abbottabad compound was expedited as a precaution.<ref name="dailymailwikileaks"/> The CIA never found anyone named Maulawi Jan and concluded that the name was an invention of al-Libi .<ref name="torture"/>

A 2010 wiretap of another suspect picked up a conversation with al-Kuwaiti. CIA paramilitary operatives located al-Kuwaiti in August 2010 and followed him back to bin Laden's Abbottabad compound.<ref name="phonecall"/> The courier and a relative (who was either a brother or a cousin) were killed in the May 2, 2011 raid.<ref name="torture"/> Afterward, some locals identified the men as [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] named Arshad and Tareq Khan.<ref name="pashtuns">{{cite news |title=Two quiet men lived in house of wonder |first=Emmanuel |last=Duparcq |first2=Sajjad | last2 = Tarakzai |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/two-quiet-men-lived-in-house-of-wonder/story-fn8ljzlv-1226049481980 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] | publisher=[[The Australian]] |date=May 4, 2011 |accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> Arshad Khan was carrying an old, noncomputerized Pakistani [[Identity document|identification card]] which said he was from Khat Kuruna, a village near [[Charsadda]] in northwestern Pakistan.

In June 2011, Pakistani officials revealed the courier's name as Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed from Pakistan's Swat Valley.

===Bin Laden's compound===
[[File:Osama bin Laden compound1.jpg|thumb|View of the compound]]
{{main|Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad}}
The CIA used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine the identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling. In September 2010, the CIA concluded that the compound was custom-built to hide someone of significance, very likely bin Laden.<ref name="MazzettiCooper"/><ref name="Dedman"/> Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife.<ref name="Dedman"/>

Built in 2004, the three-story<ref name="ZengerleBull"/> compound was located at the end of a narrow dirt road.<ref name="ref-96">{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-dead.html | title = Obama Calls World 'Safer' After Pakistan Raid | work = [[The New York Times]] | first1 = Steven Lee | last1 = Myers | first2 = Elisabeth | last2 = Bumiller | date = May 2, 2011 | accessdate =May 3, 2011}}</ref> [[Google Earth]] maps made from satellite photographs show that the compound was not present in 2001 but did exist on images taken in 2005.<ref name="ref-88">{{cite news | url = http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/05/video-inside-bin-ladens-drone-proof-compound/all/1 | title = Video: Inside bin Laden's Drone-Proof Compound | first = Spencer | last = Ackerman | first2 = Noah | last2 = Shachtman | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = May 2, 2011 | accessdate =May 3, 2011}}</ref> It is located {{convert|2.5|mi}} northeast of the city center of Abbottabad.<ref name="MazzettiCooper"/> Abbottabad is about {{convert|100|mi}} from the Afghanistan border on the far eastern side of Pakistan (about {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=x| (|)}} from India).

There was no Internet or landline telephone service to the compound, and its residents burned their trash, unlike their neighbors who set their garbage out for collection.<ref name="ZengerleBull"/> Local residents called the building the ''Waziristan [[Haveli]]'', because they believed the owner was from [[Waziristan]].<ref name="WaziristanHaveli">{{cite web |title= Osama mansion was called Waziristan Haveli

===Intelligence gathering===
[[File:CIA aerial view Osama bin Laden compound Abbottabad.jpg|thumb|CIA aerial photo of the compound.]]
The CIA led the effort to surveil and gather intelligence on the compound; other critical roles in the operation were played by other American government agencies, including the [[National Security Agency]], [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]] (ODNI), and [[United States Department of Defense|US Defense Department]].<ref name="fedtimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.federaltimes.com/article/20110509/AGENCY02/105090301/1055/AGENCY|title=Intelligence fusion got bin Laden|author=Stephen Losey|publisher=Federal Times|accessdate=May 13, 2011}}</ref> According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "The [intelligence-gathering] effort was so extensive and costly that the CIA went to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in December [2010] to secure authority to reallocate tens of millions of dollars within assorted agency budgets to fund it, U.S. officials said."<ref name="waposurveil">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/cia-spied-on-bin-laden-from-safe-house/2011/05/05/AFXbG31F_story.html|title=CIA spied on bin Laden from safe house|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 5, 2011|author=Greg Miller|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref>

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency rented a home in Abbottabad from which a team staked out and observed the compound over a number of months. The CIA team used informants and other techniques to gather intelligence on the compound. The safe house was abandoned immediately after bin Laden's death.<ref name="waposurveil"/> The U.S. [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] helped the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] create mission simulators for the pilots and analyzed data from an [[RQ-170]] drone before, during and after the raid on the compound. The NGA created three-dimensional renderings of the house, created schedules describing residential traffic patterns, and assessed the number, height and gender of the residents of the compound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/the-little-known-agency-that-helped-kill-bin-laden/238454/ |title=The Little-Known Agency That Helped Kill Bin Laden |work=The Atlantic |date= May 8, 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2011}}</ref>

The design of [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad]] may have ultimately contributed to his discovery. A former CIA official involved in the [[manhunt (military)|manhunt]] told ''The Washington Post'', "The place was three [[Second floor|stories]] high, and you could watch it from a variety of angles."<ref name="waposurveil"/>

The CIA used a process called "[[red team]]ing" on the collected intelligence to independently review the circumstantial evidence and available facts of their case that bin Laden was living at the Abbottabad compound.<ref name="sfgredteam">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/05/03/MN2H1JB94F.DTL |title=Bin Laden data not had by torture, Feinstein says|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 4, 2011|author=Carolyn Lochhead}}</ref> An administration official stated, "We conducted red-team exercises and other forms of alternative analysis to check our work.

===Objective===
The [[Associated Press]] cited two U.S. officials as stating the operation was "a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S. doesn't kill unarmed people trying to surrender", but  that "it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering".<ref name="aprisks">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/04/bin-laden-mission-risk-obama_n_857320.html|title=Osama Bin Laden Death: Obama Ran Serious Risks With Mission To Kill Terrorist Leader|agency=Associated Press|author=Lolita C.

===Planning===
The CIA briefed [[Vice Admiral]] [[William H. McRaven]], the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January&nbsp;2011. McRaven said a commando raid would be fairly straightforward but he was concerned about the Pakistani response. He assigned a captain from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) to work with a CIA team at their campus in [[Langley, Virginia]].  The captain, named "Brian", set up an office in the printing plant in the CIA's Langley compound and, with six other JSOC officers, began to plan the raid.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden">Schmidle, Nicholas, "[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/08/110808fa_fact_schmidle?currentPage=all Getting Bin Laden]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', August 8, 2011.</ref>

In addition to a helicopter raid, planners considered attacking the compound with [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] stealth bombers. They considered a joint operation with Pakistani forces.  Obama, however, decided that the Pakistani government and military could not be trusted to maintain operational security for the operation against bin Laden. "There was a real lack of confidence that the Pakistanis could keep this secret for more than a nanosecond," a senior adviser to the President told ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/>

President Obama met with the [[National Security Council]] on March&nbsp;14 to review the options. The president was concerned that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly. For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis. [[Defense Secretary]] [[Robert Gates]] and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was actually in the compound, and whether a commando raid was worth the risk. At the end of the meeting the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission. Two [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] officers were tasked with exploring that option further.<ref name="spymilitary">{{cite news|author=Siobhan Gorman |author2=Julian E. Barnes |title= Spy, Military Ties Aided bin Laden Raid |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704083904576334160172068344.html |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] (paywall) |date=May 23, 2011 |accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>

The CIA was unable to rule out the existence of an underground [[bunker]] below the compound. Presuming that one existed, 32 {{convert|2000|lb|adj=on}} [[Joint Direct Attack Munitions]] would be required to destroy it.<ref name="behindthehunt">{{cite news | last = Mazzetti | first = Mark | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/world/asia/03intel.html | title = Behind the Hunt for Bin Laden | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = May 2, 2011 | accessdate =May 3, 2011}}</ref> With that amount of [[Ammunition|ordnance]], at least one other house was in the [[blast radius]]. Estimates were that up to a dozen civilians would be killed in addition to those in the compound. Furthermore it was unlikely there would be enough evidence remaining to prove that bin Laden was dead. Presented with this information at the next Security Council meeting on March&nbsp;29, President Obama put the bombing plan on hold. Instead he directed Admiral McRaven to develop the idea of a helicopter raid.

McRaven assembled a team drawing from Red Squadron, one of four that make up DEVGRU. Red Squadron was coming home from Afghanistan and could be redirected without attracting attention. The team had language skills and experience with cross-border operations into Pakistan.<ref name="spymilitary"/> Without being told the exact nature of their mission, the team performed two rehearsals in the U.S. on April&nbsp;10 in North Carolina and April&nbsp;18 in Nevada.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/><ref name="behindthehunt"/>

Planners believed the SEALs could get to Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military. The helicopters to be used in the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known.

When the Security Council met again on April&nbsp;19, President Obama gave provisional approval for the helicopter raid. But he worried that the plan for dealing with the Pakistanis was too uncertain. Obama asked Adm. McRaven to equip the team to fight its way out if necessary.<ref name="spymilitary"/>

On April&nbsp;28 Admiral Mullen explained the final plan to the Security Council. To bolster the "fight your way out" scenario, [[Chinook helicopter]]s with additional troops would be positioned nearby. Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed. The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission. McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad, good conditions for a raid.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/>

On April&nbsp;29 at 8:20&nbsp;a.m., Obama conferred with his advisers and gave the final go-ahead. The raid would take place the following day. That evening the president was informed that the operation would be delayed one day due to cloudy weather. On April&nbsp;30 Obama called McRaven one more time to wish the SEALs well and to thank them for their service.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/>

On May&nbsp;1 at 1:22&nbsp;p.m., Panetta, acting on the president's orders, directed McRaven to move forward with the operation. Shortly after 3&nbsp;p.m., the president joined national security officials in the [[White House Situation Room|Situation Room]] to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a [[UAV|drone]] while Panetta, appearing in a corner of the screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening.<ref name="targetchapter6"/>  Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in situation room.

The Chinooks were equipped with [[Minigun|M134 Miniguns]] and extra fuel for the Black Hawks.  Their mission was to interdict any Pakistani military attempts to interfere with the raid.  Other Chinooks, holding 25 more SEALs from DEVGRU, were stationed just across the border in Afghanistan in case reinforcements were needed during the raid.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/>

The 160th SOAR helicopters were supported by multiple other aircraft, including fixed-wing fighter jets and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]].<ref name="ref-24"/> According to CNN, "the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] had a full team of combat search-and-rescue helicopters available".<ref name="ref-24"/>

The raid was scheduled for a time with little moonlight so the helicopters could enter Pakistan "low to the ground and undetected".<ref name="ref-87"/> The helicopters used hilly terrain and [[nap-of-the-earth]] techniques to reach the compound without appearing on radar and alerting the Pakistani military.  The flight from Jalalabad to Abbottabad took about 90 minutes.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/>

According to the mission plan, the first helicopter would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs [[fast-rope]]d to the ground.  At the same time, the second helicopter would fly to the northeast corner of the compound and deploy the translator, the dog, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter.

====Identification of the body====
U.S. forces used multiple methods to positively identify the body of Osama bin Laden:
* '''Measurement of the body:''' Both the corpse and bin Laden were {{convert|6|ft|4|in|cm|abbr=on}}; SEALs on the scene did not have a tape measure to measure the corpse, so a SEAL of known height lay down next to the body and the height was approximated by comparison.<ref name="ST6return"/>
* '''Facial recognition software:''' A photograph transmitted by the SEALs to CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]], for [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] analysis yielded a 90 to 95 percent likely match.<ref name="ref-94"/>
* '''In-person identification:''' One or two women from the compound, including one of bin Laden's wives,<ref name="ref-47"/> identified bin Laden's body.<ref name="ref-94"/> A wife of bin Laden called him by name during the raid, inadvertently assisting in his identification by U.S. armed forces on the ground.<ref name="ref-114"/>
* '''DNA testing:''' The [[Associated Press]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that bin Laden's body could be identified by [[DNA profiling|DNA testing]]<ref name="ref-96"/><ref name="ref-13"/> using tissue and blood samples taken from his sister who had died of brain cancer.<ref name="ref-14"/> ABC News stated, "Two samples were taken from bin Laden: one of these DNA samples was analyzed, and information was sent electronically back to Washington, D.C., from Bagram. Someone else from Afghanistan is physically bringing back a sample."<ref name="ref-94"/> A military medic took [[bone marrow]] and swabs (probably [[buccal swab]]s) from the body to use for the DNA testing.<ref name="Getting Bin Laden"/> According to a senior US Defense Department official:
{{cquote|DNA ([[deoxyribonucleic acid]]) analysis conducted separately by Department of Defense and CIA labs has positively identified Osama bin Laden. DNA samples collected from his body were compared to a comprehensive DNA profile derived from bin Laden's large extended family. Based on that analysis, the DNA is unquestionably his. The possibility of a mistaken identity on the basis of this analysis is approximately one in 11.8 quadrillion.<ref name="globalDOD" />}}
* '''Inference:''' Per the same Defense official, from the initial review of the materials removed from the Abbottabad compound the Department "assessed that much of this information, including personal correspondence between Osama bin Laden and others, as well as some of the video footage...would only have been in his possession."<ref name="globalDOD" />

ISI reported after questioning survivors of the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound at the time of the attack and that the Americans took away one person still alive, possibly a bin Laden son.

He praised the ten-year-old war against al-Qaeda, which he said had disrupted terrorist plots, strengthened homeland defenses, removed the [[Taliban]] government, and captured or killed scores of al-Qaeda operatives. Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war. Bin Laden's death was the most significant blow to al-Qaeda so far but the war would continue. He reaffirmed that the United States was not at war against Islam. He defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan. He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened. "To those families who have lost loved ones to al-Qaeda<U+2019>s terror," he said, "justice has been done."

The deputy leader of Egypt's [[Muslim Brotherhood]] said that, with bin Laden dead, western forces should now pull out of [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]]; authorities in Iran made similar comments.<ref name="ref-59"/> [[Palestinian Authority]] leaders had contrasting reactions.

The [[14th Dalai Lama]] was quoted by ''The Los Angeles Times'' as saying, "Forgiveness doesn't mean forget what happened. ... If something is serious and it is necessary to take counter-measures, you have to take counter-measures."

===Legality===
====Under U.S. law====
Following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] passed the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]].

[[John Bellinger III]], who served as the [[U.S. State Department]]'s senior lawyer during [[George W. Bush|President George W.

Similarly, [[Harold Hongju Koh]], [[Legal Adviser of the Department of State|Legal Adviser of the U.S. State Department]], said in 2010 that "under domestic law, the use of lawful weapons systems<U+2014>consistent with the applicable laws of war<U+2014>for precision [[targeted killing|targeting]] of specific high-level belligerent leaders when acting in self-defense or during an armed conflict is not unlawful, and hence does not constitute 'assassination'."<ref name="killingslegality"/>

[[David Scheffer]], director of the [[Northwestern University School of Law]] Center for International Human Rights, said the fact that bin Laden had previously been [[indict]]ed in 1998 in a [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|US District Court]] for conspiracy to attack U.S. defense installations was a complicating factor. "Normally when an individual is under indictment the purpose is to capture that person in order to bring him to court to try him ... The object is not to literally [[summary execution|summarily execute]] him if he's under indictment."<ref name="reuters-legality"/> Scheffer and another expert opined that it was important to determine whether the mission was to capture bin Laden or to kill him. If the Navy SEALs were instructed to kill bin Laden without trying first to capture him, it "may have violated American ideals if not international law."<ref name="reuters-legality"/>

====Under international law====
In an address to the [[Pakistani parliament]], Pakistan's Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gilani]] said, "Our people are rightly incensed on the issue of violation of sovereignty as typified by the covert U.S. air and ground assault on the Osama hideout in Abbottabad. ...

===Handling of the body===
Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is considered inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision.<ref name="ref-47"/><ref name="ref-46"/><ref name="ref-117"/> [[Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb]], the head of [[Al-Azhar University]], Egypt's seat of [[Sunni]] Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and human values.<ref name="ref-118"/> Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can only be allowed in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case<U+2014>the body buried in the ground with the head pointing to Islam's holy city of [[Mecca]].

A stated advantage of a burial at sea is that the site is not readily identified or accessed, thus preventing it from becoming a focus of attention or "terrorist shrine".<ref name="ref-41"/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' questioned whether bin Laden's grave would have become a shrine, as this is strongly discouraged in [[Wahhabism]]. Addressing the same concern, Egyptian Islamic analyst and lawyer [[Montasser el-Zayat]] said that if the Americans wished to avoid making a shrine to bin Laden, an unmarked grave on land would have accomplished the same goal.<ref name="ref-46"/>

''The Guardian'' also quoted a U.S. official explaining the anticipated difficulty of finding a country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil.<ref name="guardian01"/> A professor of [[Islamic Law]] at the [[University of Jordan]] stated burying at sea was permitted if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial,<ref>{{cite news |title=Islamic scholars criticize bin Laden's sea burial |author=Hamza Hendawi |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2011/may/02/islamic-scholars-criticize-bin-ladens-sea-burial/ |newspaper=[[San Diego Union Tribune]] |date=May 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 4, 2011}}</ref> and that "it's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden's body".<ref name="ref-46"/> On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand [[mufti]], stated: "They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: you dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This is not one of them."<ref name="ref-46"/>
Khalid Latif, an [[imam]] who serves as a chaplain and the director of the Islamic Center of [[New York University]], argued that the sea burial was respectful.<ref name="ref-120"/>

Leor Halevi, a professor at Vanderbilt University and the author of "Muhammad's Grave: Death Rites and the Making of Islamic Society", explained that Islamic law does not prescribe ordinary funerals for those killed in battle, and pointed to controversy within the Muslim world over whether bin Laden was, as a "mass murderer of Muslims", entitled to the same respect as mainstream Muslims. At the same time, he suggested that the burial could have been handled with more cultural sensitivity.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/opinion/08halevi.html | work=The New York Times | first=Leor | last=Halevi | title=Watery Grave, Murky Law | date=May 7, 2011}}</ref>

CNN cited a senior U.S. official as saying three sets of photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at a [[hangar]] in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on the USS ''Carl Vinson'' before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of the interior of the compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid.<ref name="cnnpictures">{{cite news|url=http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/03/even-more-on-the-photos/|title=Even more details on the OBL photos|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=CNN|coauthors=Stacia Deshishku & Jessica Yellin}}</ref>

Numerous allegations were made that the government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden.<ref name="LAT20110502"/><ref name="wsj20110503"/><ref name="ref-62"/> Critics cited the very close proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]].<ref name="ref-62"/><ref name="ref-62"/><ref name="ref-61"/><ref name="ref-63"/> U.S. government files, leaked by [[Wikileaks]], disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight [[NATO]] troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the [[government of Tajikistan]] had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.<ref name="DT20110502"/>

CIA chief [[Leon Panetta]] said the CIA had ruled out involving Pakistan in the operation, because it feared that "any effort to work with the Pakistanis could jeopardize the mission.

[[File:AbbottabadCityatNight.jpg|thumb|Abbottabad, Pakistan, at night, showing the lights of the city]]
[[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Indian Minister for Home Affairs]] [[P.

====Pakistani response====
According to a Pakistani intelligence official, raw phone-tap data had been transferred to the United States without being analyzed by Pakistan. While the U.S. "was concentrating on this" information since September 2010, information regarding bin Laden and the compound's inhabitants had "slipped from" Pakistan's "radar" over the months. Bin Laden left "an invisible footprint" and he had not been contacting other militant networks. It was noted that much focus had been placed on a courier entering and leaving the compound. The transfer of intelligence to the U.S. was a regular occurrence according to the official, who also stated regarding the raid that "I think they came in undetected and went out the same day", and Pakistan did not believe that U.S. personnel were present in the area before the special operation occurred.<ref name="Walsh"/>

According to the Pakistani high commissioner to the United Kingdom, [[Wajid Shamsul Hasan]], Pakistan had prior knowledge that an operation would happen. Pakistan was "in the know of certain things" and "what happened, happened with our consent. Americans got to know him<U+2014>where he was first<U+2014>and that's why they struck it and struck it precisely." Husain Haqqani, Pakistani ambassador to the U.S., had said that Pakistan would have pursued bin Laden had the intelligence of his location existed with them and Pakistan was "very glad that our American partners did. They had superior intelligence, superior technology, and we are grateful to them."<ref name="Walsh"/>

Another Pakistani official stated that Pakistan "assisted only in terms of authorization of the helicopter flights in our airspace" and the operation was conducted by the United States. He also said that "in any event, we did not want anything to do with such an operation in case something went wrong."<ref name="Walsh"/>

In June the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] arrested the owner of a safe house rented to the CIA to observe Osama bin Laden's compound and five CIA informants.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2077798,00.html |title=Bin Laden: Pakistan Arrests CIA Informants AP |publisher=Time.com |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

It is also important to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator/courier.
