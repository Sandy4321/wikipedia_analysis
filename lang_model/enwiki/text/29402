The '''41st Boat Race''' took place on 7 April 1884. [[The Boat Race]] is an annual [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  The race, for which [[Robert Lewis-Lloyd]] acted as both umpire and starter for the first time, was won by Cambridge by margin of two-and-a-half lengths in a time of 21 minutes 39 seconds.  The victory took the overall record in the event to 22&ndash;18 in Oxford's favour.

Oxford were coached by [[Tom Cottingham Edwards-Moss]] (who rowed for the Dark Blues four times between the [[The Boat Race 1875|1875]] and the [[The Boat Race 1878|1878 races]]) and [[William Grenfell, 1st Baron Desborough|William Grenfell]] (who represented Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1877|1877]] and 1878 races).<ref>Burnell, p. 98</ref><ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  Herbert Edward Rhodes was the Cambridge coach; he had rowed for the Light Blues four times between 1873 and 1876 and was [[Cambridge University Boat Club]] president in 1875.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search-130418.pl?sur=rhodes&suro=w&fir=h&firo=b&cit=&cito=c&c=all&tex=blue&sye=&eye=&col=all&maxcount=50 | title = Herbert Edward Rhodes| accessdate = 14 December 2014 | publisher = [[University of Cambridge]]}}</ref><ref name=drink85>Drinkwater, p. 85</ref>  The umpire for the race was [[Robert Lewis-Lloyd]] (who had rowed for Cambridge four times between 1856 and 1859)<ref>Burnell, p. 106</ref> and for the first time acted as starter.<ref>Drinkwater, pp. 85&ndash;86</ref>  He replaced Edward Searle (who had acted in that capacity since at least 1840) after the previous year's chaotic start when one of the crews failed to hear his command to start.<ref>Burnell, p. 49</ref>  The race had been postponed by two days because of the funeral of the [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]].<ref name=drink85/>

The Cambridge crew took the unusual step of taking a two week break from practice in late-January, after which they settled on a crew which, according to Drinkwater, was "considerably faster than Oxford on the day of the race."<ref name=drink85>Drinkwater, p. 85</ref>  Conversely he noted that the Dark Blue crew "did not come on at all well and were somewhat stale by the day of the race".<ref name=drink85/>

==Crews==
The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 12.75&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (75.5&nbsp;kg), {{convert|0.25|lb|kg|1}} more than their opponents.<ref name=burn63/> Oxford saw two former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] return to the crew, including A. R. Paterson who was rowing in his fourth consecutive Boat Race.  The Cambridge crew contained four rowers with Boat Race experience, including Charles William Moore who was making his fourth appearance in the event.<ref>Burnell, pp. 62&ndash;63</ref>  For the first time in three years, the race featured no non-British competitors.<ref>Burnell, p. 38</ref>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]], along which the race is conducted]]
Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=drink86>Drinkwater, p. 86</ref>  The Light Blues made the quicker start and held a clear water advantage by the time the crews passed the Crab Tree pub.  Cambridge kept this advantage to [[Hammersmith Bridge]] at which point Oxford spurted and recovered some of the deficit, but the [[Cantabrigian]]s increased their [[stroke rate]] to go clear once again by Corney Reach.  Despite the efforts of the Oxford [[stroke (rowing)|stroke]] W. D. B. Curry to push his crew, according to Drinkwater, "at [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] they fell to pieces."<ref name=drink86/>  Cambridge went on to win by two-and-a-half lengths in a time of 21 minutes 39 seconds, recording their first victory in six years, and took the overall record to 22&ndash;18 in Oxford's favour.<ref name=results/><ref name=burn63>Burnell, p. 63</ref>
