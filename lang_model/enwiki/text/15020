'''Rock in Puerto Rico''' has been a product of direct and indirect influence from both American rock music and Latin [[rock music]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, and its fusion with other genres{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Throughout history, the genre has suffered ups and downs having a significant peak in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Here's a breakdown of how rock evolved in the island through the decades.

==1950s and 1960s==
The 1950s mark the introduction of the genre in the island. With the [[Elvis Presley]] hype in the [[USA]], some of it reached the island. [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[Alfred D. Herger]] started bringing rock acts into the island motivating the local audience to embrace it. This input, and Herger's tutelage, ignited some young artists like Aidita Viles,Chucho Avellanet and others to start a movement that was labeled as "la nueva ola" (The New Wave). Herger also led several television night shows where he showcased rock music from the island and the USA.

==Late 1960s and 1970s==
In the mid to late 1960s, several Puerto Rican bands started surfacing with some mainstream success. Most of these performed in [[English language|English]]. Some of these were:

In the early 1970s, other bands like Bandolero, and La Banda del K-rajo had some underground success. Later that decade, a number of bands emerged from San Juan area bars like Shannan's Pub and Donna Faye's. The most popular bands at this time where Ta<U+00ED>no, Pelican in Flight, Spoiler, Albatross, East Side Band, and many others.

At the same time, a movement of nova trova musicians was growing in the island led by singers like [[Roy Brown (Puerto Rican musician)|Roy Brown]] and Noel Hern<U+00E1>ndez. During this time, the local radio station AlfaRock starts broadcasting rock music in the island.

==The 1980s==
With the arrival of stations like [[MTV]], American rock reached the island. However, surging [[rock en espa<U+00F1>ol]] bands from [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]] and [[Spain]] are rarely heard of. Most of the local bands still used English as their language. Some of the bands that surfaced through this decade were:
* Apocalips
* Black Widow
* Rebel Rose
* Cardinal Sin
* Sekel
* Red Crusader
* Corrupted Society
* Rybeck
* Whisker Biscuit
* The MD<U+2019>s

However, there were still a few bands that preferred to sing in Spanish like: Virus, Kantares and Belaris. Artists of other genres like [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]], [[Wilkins V<U+00E9>lez|Wilkins]] and [[Glenn Monroig]] started fusing their music (pop/ballads) with rock. This decade also started the ongoing "battle" between "[[Cocolo]]s" (people that listen to [[Salsa music|salsa]]) and "rockeros" (people that listen to [[Rock music]]). The introduction of [[New Wave music|new wave]] and [[europop]] in the USA started the surging of similar bands like Words Four Two, [[No You Turn]], NeoEngland, and Nirvana (not the [[Kurt Cobain]] band). In 1988, a pop-rock band called Top Banana was signed by national label CBS.

==The 1990s==
During this decade, rock music reached its peak in the island. [[Rock en Espa<U+00F1>ol]] fully reached the island, and artists like [[Miguel Mateos]], [[Charly Garc<U+00ED>a]], [[Soda Stereo]], [[Hombres G]] [[Robi Draco Rosa]] and others were heard in radio stations. Mattador released the first instance of their album ''Save Us From Ourselves'' with guitarist Ram<U+00F3>n Ortiz, who would later go on to play with [[Puya (band)|Puya]]. The band even opened the [[Iron Maiden]] concert at the island. On January 4, 1990, John Rodriguez aka. [[MetalKid]], a radio personality launched the first radio program to cater only Puerto Rican artists at La Mega Station 106 FM along with Edgardo "El Bebo" Adames; giving the opportunity to dozens of acts play their music on the radio. Later that year MetalKid created [[Brutal Noise Music]], the first record label to include metal music on their roster. Bands like [[Crypta]], [[Homicide]], [[Morbid Death]], [[Deathkross]] and the Christian act [[Deathless]] among others were the first metal releases to be available under [[Brutal Noise]]. Brutal Noise joined forces with local promoter Albert Morales from ShowNet and produced concerts like [[Iron Maiden]], [[Pantera]], [[Sepultura]], [[Slayer]] making the way to promote local acts on their shows. Until today this tradition still alive. In 1994, former [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]] singer [[Robi Rosa]] released his first solo album, and Mattador re-released their album, this time with Tito Rodr<U+00ED>guez (now with [[Sol D'Menta]]) as guitarist. [[La Secta Allstar]] is the most commercially successful rock band in Puerto Rico, selling over 250,000 copies from their last album ''Consejo'' and reaching platinum. Since their debut in Puerto Rican charts in 1998.

The 90's saw also the first video from a local band in MTV Latino. It was for the song "Terminal" by La Mosca, aka Spanish Fly and Spanish Flies. The band was a power trio  composed of Geronimo Mercado, Eduardo Paniagua & Gaby Vidal. Eduardo would later go to Puya & Gaby Vidal to ONGO. Steve Vai used the band as his backing band when he came to Puerto Rico for a guitar clinic at Villa Piano. When Draco came to the island for his three show at The Warehouse, La Mosca was chosen to open them all.
