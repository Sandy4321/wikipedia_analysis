[[Image:Hunger_strike_flag.jpg|thumb|right|A flag commemorating the 25th anniversary of the hunger strike.]] The '''1981 Irish hunger strike''' was the culmination of a five-year protest during [[The Troubles]] by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] prisoners in [[Northern Ireland]]. The protest began as the [[blanket protest]] in 1976, when the [[British government]] withdrew [[Special Category Status]] for convicted paramilitary prisoners. In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to "[[Slopping out|slop out]]", the dispute escalated into the [[dirty protest]], where prisoners refused to wash and covered the walls of their cells with excrement. In 1980 seven prisoners participated in the first hunger strike, which ended after 53 days.<ref name="cainhsc">{{cite web | title = The Hunger Strike of 1981 - A Chronology of Main Events | author = | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/chronology.htm | publisher = [[CAIN]]  | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref>

The second hunger strike took place in 1981 and was a showdown between the prisoners and the British [[Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]. One hunger striker, [[Bobby Sands]], was elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] during the strike, prompting media interest from around the world.<ref name="rbs">{{cite web | title = Remembering Bobby Sands | author = [[David McKittrick]] | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article362092.ece | publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' | date = [[5 May]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> The strike was called off after ten prisoners had starved themselves to death<U+2013>including Sands, whose funeral was attended by 100,000 people.<ref name="cainhsc"/> The strike radicalised [[Irish nationalist|nationalist]] politics, and was the driving force that enabled [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] to become a mainstream political party.<ref name="pt0">{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Taylor (Journalist) | title = Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in | publisher = [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] | date = 1997 | pages = pp. 251<U+2013>252 | isbn = 0-7475-3818-2 }}</ref>

==Background==
There had been [[Hunger strike#Irish republicans|Irish republican hunger strikes]] since 1917, and twelve men had previously died on hunger strikes including [[Thomas Ashe]], [[Terence MacSwiney]], [[Se<U+00E1>n McCaughey]], [[Michael Gaughan (Irish republican)|Michael Gaughan]] and [[Frank Stagg]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Meehan | first = Mairtin <U+00D3>g | title = Finely Tempered Steel: Sean McCaughey and the IRA | publisher = Republican Publications | date = 2006 | pages = p. 78 | isbn = 0-05429463-7}}</ref> After the introduction of [[internment]] in 1971, [[Maze (HM Prison)|Long Kesh]]&mdash;later known as HM Prison Maze&mdash;was run as a [[prisoner of war]] camp. Internees lived in dormitories and disciplined themselves with military-style command structures, [[military drill|drilled]] with dummy guns made from wood, and held lectures on [[guerrilla warfare]] and revolutionary politics.<ref name="tmd">{{cite book | last = Beresford | first = David | authorlink =  | title = Ten Men Dead | publisher = [[Grove/Atlantic Inc.|Atlantic Monthly Press]] | date = 1987 | pages = pp. 13<U+2013>16 | isbn = 0-87113-702-X}}</ref> Convicted prisoners were refused the same rights as internees until July 1972, when [[Special Category Status]] was introduced following a hunger strike by 40 [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) prisoners led by the veteran republican [[Billy McKee]]. Special Category, or political, status meant prisoners were treated very much like prisoners of war, for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work.<ref name="tmd"/> In 1976, as part of the policy of "criminalisation", the British Government brought an end to Special Category Status for paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland. The policy was not introduced for existing prisoners, but for those convicted of offences after [[1 March]] [[1976]].<ref name="c76">{{cite web | title = A Chronology of the Conflict - 1976 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch76.htm | publisher = CAIN | date = | accessdate = 2007-04-09}}</ref> The end to Special Category Status was a serious threat to the authority which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow.<ref name="tmd"/>

==Blanket and dirty protests==
{{main|blanket protest|dirty protest}}

On [[14 September]] [[1976]], newly convicted prisoner [[Kieran Nugent]] began the [[blanket protest]], in which IRA and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) prisoners refused to wear prison uniform and either went naked or fashioned garments from prison blankets.<ref name="c76"/> In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to "[[slop out]]" (i.e., empty their chamber pots), this escalated into the [[dirty protest]], where prisoners refused to wash and smeared the walls of their cells with excrement.<ref>''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', p. 220.</ref> These protests aimed to re-establish their political status by securing what were known as the "Five Demands":

# The right not to wear a prison uniform;
# The right not to do prison work; 
# The right of free association with other prisoners, and to organise educational and recreational pursuits; 
# The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week;
# Full restoration of remission lost through the protest.<ref name="pt1">''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', pp. 229<U+2013>234.</ref>

Initially, this protest did not attract a great deal of attention, and even the IRA regarded it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign.<ref name="pt3">''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', p. 217.</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Holland, Jack & McDonald, Henry  | title = INLA Deadly Divisions | publisher = Poolbeg | date = 1996 | pages = p. 261  | isbn = 1-85371-263-9}}</ref> It began to attract attention when [[Tom<U+00E1>s Cardinal <U+00D3> Fiaich|Tom<U+00E1>s <U+00D3> Fiaich]], the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], visited the prison and condemned the conditions there.<ref>{{cite web | title = The deaths that gave new life to an IRA legend | author = David Beresford | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/fromthearchive/story/0,,1055373,00.html | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]'' | date = [[5 October]] [[1981]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> In 1979, former MP [[Bernadette McAliskey]] stood in the election for the [[European Parliament]] on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn F<U+00E9>in had called for a boycott of this election.<ref>{{cite web | title = The 1979 European elections | author = Nicholas Whyte | url = http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/fe79.htm | publisher = CAIN | date = [[18 April]] [[2004]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A View North Anniversaries recall the rise of Sinn F<U+00E9>in | author = Jack Holland | url = http://www.irishecho.com/search/searchstory.cfm?id=8710&issueid=184 | publisher = ''[[The Irish Echo]]'' | date = [[7 March]] [[2001]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> Shortly after this, the broad-based National H-Block/Armagh Committee was formed, on a platform of support for the "Five Demands", with McAliskey as its main spokesperson.<ref>''Ten Men Dead'', pp. 21<U+2013>22.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Abstracts on Organisations - 'N' | author = | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/norgan.htm | publisher = CAIN | date = | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> The period leading up to the hunger strike saw a campaign of assassination carried out by both sides.

==First hunger strike==

On [[27 October]] [[1980]], republican prisoners in HM Prison Maze began a hunger strike. Many prisoners volunteered to be part of the strike, but a total of seven were selected to match the number of men who signed the [[Easter Rising|Easter 1916]] [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation of the Republic]]. The group consisted of IRA members [[Brendan Hughes]], [[Tommy McKearney]], [[Raymond McCartney]], Tom McFeeley, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and INLA member John Nixon.<ref>{{cite book | last = O'Rawe | first = Richard | title = Blanketmen | publisher = New Island | date = 2005 | pages = pp. 103<U+2013>104 | isbn = 1-904301-67-3}}</ref> After a few weeks three prisoners in [[Armagh Women's Prison]] joined the strike, including [[Mair<U+00E9>ad Farrell]], followed by a short-lived hunger strike by several dozen more prisoners in HM Prison Maze. In a war of nerves between the IRA leadership and the British government, with McKenna lapsing in and out of a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a thirty-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on [[18 December]].<ref name="pt1"/>

==Second hunger strike==
[[Image:Hunger strike memorial.jpg|thumb|left|A hunger strike memorial in [[Milltown Cemetery]], [[Belfast]].]]
In January 1981 it became clear that the prisoners' demands had not been conceded. Prison authorities began to supply the prisoners with officially issued civilian clothing, whereas the prisoners demanded the right to wear their own clothing. On [[4 February]] the prisoners issued a statement saying that the British government had failed to resolve the crisis and declared their intention of "hunger striking once more".<ref name="hist">{{cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard English | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] | date = 2003 | pages = pp. 195<U+2013>196 | isbn = 0-330-49388-4 }}</ref> The second hunger strike began on [[1 March]], when [[Bobby Sands]], the IRA's former [[Officer Commanding]] (OC) in the prison, refused food. Unlike the first strike, the prisoners joined one at a time and at staggered intervals, which they believed would arouse maximum public support and exert maximum pressure on Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name="pt6">''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', p. 237.</ref>

The republican movement initially struggled to generate public support for the second hunger strike. The Sunday before Sands began his strike, 3,500 people marched through west Belfast; during the first hunger strike four months earlier the marchers had numbered 10,000.<ref name="pt4">''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', pp. 239<U+2013>240.</ref> Five days into the strike, however, [[Independent Republican]] MP for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]] [[Frank Maguire]] died, resulting in a [[Fermanagh & South Tyrone by-election, 1981 (April)|by-election]]. There was debate among nationalists and republicans regarding who should contest the election: [[Austin Currie]] of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] expressed an interest, as did Bernadette McAliskey and Maguire's brother Noel.<ref name="cainhsc"/> After negotiations, and implied threats to Noel Maguire, they agreed not to split the nationalist vote by contesting the election and Sands stood as an [[Anti H-Block]] candidate against [[Ulster Unionist Party]] candidate [[Harry West]].<ref name="pt4"/><ref name="em">{{cite book | last = Moloney | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Moloney | title = A Secret History of the IRA | publisher = [[Penguin Books]] | date = 2002 | pages = pp. 211<U+2013>212 | isbn = 0-141-01041-X}}</ref> Following a high-profile campaign the election took place on [[9 April]], and Sands was elected to the [[British House of Commons]] with 30,492 votes to West's 29,046.<ref>{{cite web | title = Westminster By-election (NI) - Thursday 9 April 1981 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/rwby1981a.htm | publisher = CAIN | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref>  

Sands' election victory raised hopes that a settlement could be negotiated, but Margaret Thatcher stood firm in refusing to give concessions to the hunger strikers. She stated "We are not prepared to consider special category status for certain groups of people serving sentences for crime. Crime is crime is crime, it is not political".<ref>{{cite web | title = What happened in the hunger strike? | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4941866.stm | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = [[5 May]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-05-28}}</ref> The world's media descended on Belfast, and several intermediaries visited Sands in an attempt to negotiate an end to the hunger strike, including [[S<U+00ED>le de Valera]], granddaughter of [[<U+00C9>amon de Valera]], [[Pope John Paul II]]'s personal envoy [[John Magee (bishop)|John Magee]], and [[European Commission of Human Rights]] officials.<ref name="rbs"/><ref name="pt5">''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', pp. 242<U+2013>243.</ref> With Sands close to death, the government's position remained unchanged, with [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]] [[Humphrey Atkins]] stating "If Mr. Sands persisted in his wish to commit suicide, that was his choice. The Government would not force medical treatment upon him".<ref name="pt5"/> 

On [[5 May]], Sands died in the prison hospital on the sixty-sixth day of his hunger strike, prompting rioting in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland.<ref name="cainhsc"/> Humphrey Atkins issued a statement saying that Sands had committed suicide "under the instructions of those who felt it useful to their cause that he should die".<ref name="tch">{{cite book | last = Ellison, Graham & Smyth, Jim | title = The Crowned Harp: policing Northern Ireland  | publisher = [[Pluto Press]] | date = 2000 | pages = p. 102| isbn = 0745313930}}</ref> Over 100,000 people lined the route of his funeral, which was conducted with full IRA military honours. Margaret Thatcher showed no regret for his death, telling the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that, "Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal. He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organisation did not allow to many of its victims".<ref name="pt5"/>

In the two weeks following Sands' death, three more hunger strikers died. [[Francis Hughes]] died on [[12 May]], resulting in further rioting in nationalist areas of Northern Ireland, in particular Derry and Belfast. Following the deaths of [[Raymond McCreesh]] and [[Patsy O<U+2019>Hara]] on [[21 May]], [[Tom<U+00E1>s Cardinal <U+00D3> Fiaich|Tom<U+00E1>s <U+00D3> Fiaich]], by then [[Primate of All Ireland]], criticised the British government's handling of the hunger strike.<ref name="cainhsc"/> Despite this Margaret Thatcher refused to negotiate a settlement, stating "Faced with the failure of their discredited cause, the men of violence have chosen in recent months to play what may well be their last card", during a visit to Belfast in late May.<ref name="tch"/>

Nine protesting prisoners contested the [[Irish general election, 1981|general election]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in June. [[Kieran Doherty]] and [[Paddy Agnew (Irish republican)|Paddy Agnew]] (who was not on hunger strike) were elected in [[Cavan-Monaghan_%28D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_constituency%29#1981_full_result|Cavan-Monaghan]] and [[Louth_%28D%C3%A1il_%C3%89ireann_constituency%29#1981_full_result|Louth]] respectively, and [[Joe McDonnell]] narrowly missed election in [[Sligo-Leitrim (D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann constituency)|Sligo-Leitrim]].<ref name="ob">{{cite book | last = O'Brien | first = Brendan |authorlink = Brendan O'Brien (Irish journalist) | title = The Long War: The IRA and Sinn F<U+00E9>in | publisher = Syracuse Univ Pr | date = 1995 | pages = p. 123 |isbn = 0815603193}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Sligo hunger striker's death to be remembered | author = | url = http://archives.tcm.ie/sligoweekender/2006/07/04/story28630.asp | publisher = ''Sligo Weekender'' | date = [[4 July]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> There were also local elections in Northern Ireland around that time and although Sinn F<U+00E9>in did not contest them, some smaller groups and independents who did support the hunger strikers had a few successes, e.g. the [[Irish Independence Party]] won 21 seats, while the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] (the INLA's political wing) and [[People's Democracy]] (a [[Trotskyist]] group) won two seats each, and a number of pro-hunger strike independent candidates also won seats.<ref>{{cite book | last = Berresford Ellis | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Berresford Ellis | title = A History of the Irish Working Class | publisher = Pluto Press | date = 1985 | pages = p. 336 | isbn = 074530009X}}</ref><ref>Berresford Ellis states 12 independent councillors were elected.

[[Image:Kieran Doherty.jpg|thumb|right|A memorial to hunger striker [[Kieran Doherty]].]]
Following the deaths of Joe McDonnell and [[Martin Hurson]] the families of some of the hunger strikers attended a meeting on [[28 July]] with Catholic priest [[Denis Faul|Father Denis Faul]]. The families expressed concern at the lack of a settlement to the priest, and a decision was made to meet with [[Gerry Adams]] later that day. At the meeting Father Faul put pressure on Adams to find a way of ending the strike, and Adams agreed to ask the IRA leadership to order the men to end the hunger strike.<ref>''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', p. 248.</ref> The following day Adams held a meeting with six of the hunger strikers to outline a proposed settlement on offer from the British government should the strike be brought to an end.<ref>''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA'', p. 202.</ref> The strikers rejected the settlement, believing that accepting anything less than the "Five Demands" would be a betrayal of the sacrifice made by Bobby Sands and the other men who had died.<ref>{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter |title = Brits | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | date = 2002 | pages = p. 239 | isbn = 0-7475-5806-X}}</ref>

On [[31 July]] the hunger strike began to break, when the mother of [[Paddy Quinn (Irish republican)|Paddy Quinn]] insisted on medical intervention to save his life. The following day [[Kevin Lynch (hunger striker)|Kevin Lynch]] died, followed by [[Kieran Doherty]] on [[2 August]], [[Thomas McElwee]] on [[8 August]] and [[Michael Devine]] on [[20 August]].<ref>''Provos The IRA & Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', pp. 249<U+2013>251.</ref> On the day Devine died, Sands' election agent [[Owen Carron]] won the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, August 1981|Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election]] with more votes but with a reduced majority.<ref>{{cite web | title = Fermanagh and South Tyrone 1973<U+2013>1982 | author = Nicholas Whyte | url = http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/cfst.htm | publisher = [[Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive]] | date = [[25 March]] [[2003]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> On [[6 September]] the family of [[Laurence McKeown]] became the fourth family to intervene and asked for medical treatment to save his life, and [[Cahal Cardinal Daly|Cardinal Daly]] issued a statement calling on republican prisoners to end the hunger strike. A week later [[James Prior, Baron Prior|James Prior]] replaced Humphrey Atkins as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and met with prisoners in an attempt to end the strike.<ref name="cainhsc"/> Liam McCloskey ended his strike on [[26 September]] after his family said they would ask for medical intervention if he became unconscious, and it became clear that the families of the remaining hunger strikers would also intervene to save their lives. The strike was called off at 3:15&nbsp;pm on [[3 October]],<ref>{{cite book | last = Walker | first = R. K. | authorlink = | title = The Hunger Strikes | publisher = Lagan Books | date = 2006 | pages = p. 138 | isbn = 1904684181}}</ref> and three days later Prior announced partial concessions to the prisoners including the right to wear their own clothes at all times.<ref name="pt0"/> The only one of the "Five Demands" still outstanding was the right not to do prison work. Following sabotage by the prisoners and the [[Maze Prison escape]] in 1983 the prison workshops were closed, effectively granting all of the "Five Demands" but without any formal recognition of political status from the government.<ref>''Ten Men Dead'', p. 332.</ref>

The British press hailed the hunger strike as a triumph for Thatcher, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper stating "The Government had overcome the hunger strikes by a show of resolute determination not to be bullied".<ref>''Ten Men Dead'', p. 331.</ref> However, the hunger strike was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for Thatcher and the British government.<ref name="as">''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA'', pp. 207<U+2013>208.</ref> Thatcher became a republican hate figure of [[Cromwellian]] proportions, with [[Danny Morrison (Irish republican)|Danny Morrison]] describing her as "the biggest bastard we have ever known".<ref name="as"/> There was extensive international condemnation of the British government's handling of the hunger strike, and the relationship between the British and Irish governments was strained.<ref name="rbs"/> As with [[internment]] in 1971 and [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1972, IRA recruitment was boosted, resulting in a new surge of paramilitary activity.<ref name="as"/> There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in [[Dublin]].<ref name="cainhsc"/> Security forces fired 29,695 [[plastic bullets]] in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared to a total of around 16,000 bullets and four deaths in the eight years following the hunger strikes.<ref>''The Long War: The IRA and Sinn F<U+00E9>in'', p. 44.</ref> The IRA continued its armed campaign during the seven months of the strike, killing thirteen policemen, eight soldiers, five members of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] and five civilians. The seven months were one of the bloodiest periods of [[the Troubles]] with a total of 61 people killed, 34 of them civilians.<ref name="pt6"/> Three years later the IRA tried to take their revenge on Thatcher with the [[Brighton hotel bombing]], an attack on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] conference that killed five people and in which Thatcher herself only narrowly escaped death.<ref name="rbs"/>

The hunger strike prompted Sinn F<U+00E9>in to move towards electoral politics<U+2014>Sands' election victory combined with that of pro-hunger strike candidates in the Northern Ireland local elections and D<U+00E1>il elections in the Republic of Ireland gave birth to the [[armalite and ballot box strategy]], with Gerry Adams remarking "His [Sands] victory exposed the lie that the hunger strikers<U+2014>and by extension the IRA and the whole republican movement<U+2014>had no popular support".<ref>''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA'', p. 200.</ref> The election victories of Doherty and Agnew also had political impact in the Republic of Ireland, as they denied power to [[Charles Haughey|Charles Haughey's]] outgoing [[Fianna F<U+00E1>il]] government.<ref name="ob"/> In 1982 Sinn F<U+00E9>in won five seats in the elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1982|Northern Ireland Assembly]], and in 1983 Gerry Adams won a seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|UK general election]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Abstentionism: Sinn F<U+00E9>in Ard Fheis, 1<U+2013>2 November 1986 | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/abstentionism/chron.htm | publisher = CAIN |accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> As a result of the political base built during the hunger strike, Sinn F<U+00E9>in continued to grow in the following two decades, and it is currently the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland holding 28 out of 108 seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].<ref name="pt0"/><ref>{{cite web | title = DUP top in NI assembly election |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6435755.stm | publisher = BBC | date = [[12 March]], [[2007]] | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}</ref>

In 2005, the role of Gerry Adams was questioned by former prisoner Richard O'Rawe, who was the public relations officer inside the prison during the strike. O'Rawe states in his book ''Blanketmen'' that Adams prolonged the strike as it was of great political benefit to Sinn F<U+00E9>in and allowed Owen Carron to win Sands' seat.<ref>{{cite web | title = The legacy of the hunger strikes | author = Melanie McFadyean| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,1721871,00.html | publisher = ''The Guardian'' | date = [[4 March]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 'The Blanket' meets 'Blanketmen' | author =  Anthony McIntyre | url = http://lark.phoblacht.net/AMROR1605068g.html | publisher = ''The Blanket'' | date = [[16 May]] [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> This claim is denied by several hunger strikers and [[Brendan McFarlane]], who was OC inside the prison during the hunger strike.<ref>{{cite web | title = Former comrades' war of words over hunger strike | author = Steven McCaffrey | url = http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/irish_news/arts2005/mar11_hunger_strike_war_of_words.php | publisher = ''[[The Irish News]]'' | date = [[12 March]] [[2005]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}</ref> McFarlane claims O'Rawe's version of events is confused and fragmentary, and states "We were desperate for a solution. Any deal that went some way to meeting the five demands would have been taken. If it was confirmed in writing, we'd have grabbed it . . . There was never a deal, there was never a "take it or leave it" option at all".<ref>''The Hunger Strikes'', pp. 185<U+2013>186.</ref>
