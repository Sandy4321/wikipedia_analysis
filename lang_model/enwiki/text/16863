An '''extended periodic table''' theorises about elements beyond element 118 (the last one of period 7). Currently seven [[period (periodic table)|period]]s in the [[periodic table]] of [[chemical elements]] are known and proven, culminating with [[atomic number]] [[Ununoctium|118]]. If further elements with higher atomic numbers than this are discovered, they will be placed in additional periods, laid out (as with the existing periods) to illustrate periodically recurring trends in the properties of the elements concerned. Any additional periods are expected to contain a larger number of elements than the seventh period, as they are calculated to have an additional so-called '''g-block''', containing at least 18 elements with partially filled g-[[atomic orbital|orbital]]s in each period. An '''eight-period table''' containing this block was suggested by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lbl.gov/LBL-PID/Nobelists/Seaborg/65th-anniv/29.html|title= An Early History of LBNL|first=Glenn T.|last=Seaborg|authorlink=Glenn T.

No elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature.<ref>[[Unbibium|Element 122]] was claimed to exist naturally in April 2008, but this claim was widely believed to be erroneous. {{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2008/May/02050802.asp|title=Heaviest element claim criticised|publisher=Rsc.org|date=2008-05-02|accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref> The first element of the g-block may have [[atomic number]] 121, and thus would have the [[Systematic element name|systematic name]] [[unbiunium]]. Elements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to [[radioactive decay]], and have extremely short [[half life|half lives]], although [[unbihexium|element 126]] is hypothesized to be within an [[island of stability]] that is resistant to fission but not to [[alpha decay]]. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, if period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9.

According to the orbital approximation in [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] descriptions of atomic structure, the g-block would correspond to elements with partially filled g-orbitals. However, [[spin-orbit coupling]] effects reduce the validity of the orbital approximation substantially for elements of high [[atomic number]]. While Seaborg's version of the extended period had the heavier elements following the pattern set by lighter elements, as it did not take into account [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], models that take relativistic effects into account do not. [[Pekka Pyykk<U+00F6>]] and B. Fricke used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to ''[[Atomic number|Z]]'' = 184 (comprising periods 8, 9, and the beginning of 10), and found that several were displaced from the [[Aufbau principle#The Madelung energy ordering rule|Madelung rule]].<ref name="Fricke">{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=B. |last2=Greiner |first2=W. |last3=Waber |first3=J.

==Extended periodic table, including the g-block==
It is unknown how far the periodic table might extend beyond the known 118 elements. [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] suggested that the highest possible element may be under ''Z''=130.<ref name=EB/> However, [[Walter Greiner]] predicts that there may not be a highest possible element.<ref name="rsc"/>

{{Extended periodic table (by Fricke, 32 columns, compact)}}

All of these hypothetical undiscovered elements are named by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) [[systematic element name]] standard which creates a generic name for use until the element has been discovered, confirmed, and an official name approved. However, typically they are not even named at all in the scientific literature, and are simply referred to by their atomic numbers; hence, element 164 would usually not be called "unhexquadium" (the IUPAC systematic name), but rather "element 164" with symbol "164", "(164)", or "E164".

{{As of|2011|04}}, synthesis has been attempted for only [[ununennium]], [[unbinilium]], unbibium, unbiquadium, unbihexium, and unbiseptium. (Z = 119, 120, 122, 124, 126, and 127)

At element 118, the orbitals 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 5f, 6s, 6p, 6d, 7s and 7p are assumed to be filled, with the remaining orbitals unfilled. The orbitals of the eighth period are predicted to be filled in the order 8s, 5g, 6f, 7d, 8p. However, after approximately element 120, the proximity of the electron shells makes placement in a simple table problematic.

==Pyykk<U+00F6> model==

{{Expert-subject|date=December 2011}}
Not all models show the higher elements following the pattern established by lighter elements. [[Pekka Pyykk<U+00F6>]], for example, used computer modeling to calculate the positions of elements up to Z=172, and found that several were displaced from the [[Aufbau principle|Madelung energy-ordering rule]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2010/11/Extended_elements.asp|title=Extended elements: new periodic table|year=2010}}</ref> He predicts that the orbital shells will fill up in this order:
*8s,
*5g,
*the first two spaces of 8p,
*6f,
*7d,
*9s,
*the first two spaces of 9p,
*the rest of 8p.
He also suggests that period 8 be split into three parts:
*8a, containing 8s,
*8b, containing the first two elements of 8p,
*8c, containing 7d and the rest of 8p.<ref name="PT172">{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykk<U+00F6>|first1=Pekka|authorlink=Pekka Pyykk<U+00F6>|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z<U+2264> 172, based on Dirac<U+2013>Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161<U+2013>8|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P }}</ref>

==Predicted properties of undiscovered elements==
Element 118 is the last element that has been claimed to have been synthesized. The next two elements, [[ununennium|elements 119]] and [[unbinilium|120]], should form an 8s series and be an [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]] respectively. Beyond element 120, the [[superactinide]] series is expected to begin, when the 8s electrons and the filling 8p<sub>1/2</sub>, 7d<sub>3/2</sub>, 6f<sub>5/2</sub>, and 5g<sub>7/2</sub> subshells determine the chemistry of these elements. Complete and accurate CCSD calculations are not available for elements beyond 122 because of the extreme complexity of the situation: the 5g, 6f, and 7d orbitals should have about the same energy level, and in the region of element 160 the 9s, 8p<sub>3/2</sub>, and 9p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals should also be about equal in energy. This will cause the electron shells to mix so that the [[block (periodic table)|block]] concept no longer applies very well, and will also result in novel chemical properties that will make positioning these elements in a periodic table very difficult. For example, element 164 is expected to mix characteristics of the elements of [[group 10 element|group 10]], [[group 12 element|12]], and [[noble gas|18]].<ref name=Haire/>

The first two elements of period 8 are expected to be [[ununennium]] and [[unbinilium]], elements 119 and 120. Their electron configurations should have the 8s shell being filled. However, the 8s orbital is relativistically stabilized and contracted and thus, elements 119 and 120 should be more like [[caesium]] and [[barium]] than their immediate neighbours above, [[francium]] and [[radium]]. Another effect of the relativistic contraction of the 8s orbital is that the [[atomic radius|atomic radii]] of these two elements should be about the same of those of francium and radium. They should behave like normal [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s, normally forming +1 and +2 [[oxidation state]]s respectively, but the relativistic destabilization of the 7p<sub>3/2</sub> subshell and the relatively low [[ionization energy|ionization energies]] of the 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electrons should make higher oxidation states like +3 and +4 (respectively) possible as well.<ref name="Fricke"/><ref name=Haire>{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss|editor2-first = Norman M.| editor2-last = Edelstein| editor3-last = Fuger|editor3-first = Jean| last = Haire|first = Richard G.| chapter = Transactinides and the future elements| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]| year = 2006| isbn = 1-4020-3555-1| location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands| edition = 3rd| ref = CITEREFHaire2006}}</ref>

====Superactinides====
The superactinide series is expected to contain elements [[unbiunium|121]] to 155. In the superactinide series, the 7d<sub>3/2</sub>, 8p<sub>1/2</sub>, 6f<sub>5/2</sub> and 5g<sub>7/2</sub> shells should all fill simultaneously:<ref name=BFricke/> this creates very complicated situations, so much so that complete and accurate CCSD calculations have been done only for elements 121 and 122.<ref name=Haire/> The first superactinide, unbiunium (element 121), should be a [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]] of [[lanthanum]] and [[actinium]] and should have similar properties to them:<ref>{{cite doi|10.1063/1.1672054}}</ref> its main oxidation state should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120.<ref name=Haire/> However, relativistically stabilization of the 8p subshell should result in a ground-state 8s<sup>2</sup>8p<sup>1</sup> valence electron configuration for element 121, in contrast to the ds<sup>2</sup> configurations of lanthanum and actinium.<ref name=Haire/> Its first ionization energy is predicted to be 429.4&nbsp;kJ/mol, which would be lower than those of all known elements except for the [[alkali metals]] [[potassium]], [[rubidium]], [[caesium]], and [[francium]]: this value is even lower than that of the period 8 alkali metal ununennium (463.1&nbsp;kJ/mol). Similarly, the next superactinide, unbibium (element 122), may be a congener of [[cerium]] and [[thorium]] with a main oxidation state of +4, but would have a ground-state 7d<sup>1</sup>8s<sup>2</sup>8p<sup>1</sup> valence electron configuration unlike thorium's d<sup>2</sup>s<sup>2</sup> configuration. Hence, its first [[ionization energy]] would be smaller than thorium's (Th: 6.54&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]]; Ubb: 5.6&nbsp;eV) because of the greater ease of ionizing unbibium's 8p<sub>1/2</sub> electron than thorium's 7s electron.<ref name=Haire/> In the first few superactinides, the binding energies of the added electrons are predicted to be small enough that they can lose all their valence electrons; for example, [[unbihexium]] (element 126) could easily form a +8 oxidation state, and even higher oxidation states for the next few elements may be possible. Unbihexium is also predicted to display a variety of other [[oxidation state]]s: recent calculations have suggested a stable [[Fluoride|monofluoride]] UbhF may be possible, resulting from a bonding interaction between the 5g&nbsp;[[Atomic orbital|orbital]] on unbihexium and the 2[[p-orbital|p]]&nbsp;orbital on [[fluorine]].<ref name=Jacoby>{{Cite journal|last=Jacoby|first=Mitch|title=As-yet-unsynthesized superheavy atom should form a stable diatomic molecule with fluorine|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|year=2006|volume=84|issue=10|pages=19|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/84/i10/8410notw9.html|accessdate=2008-01-14|doi=10.1021/cen-v084n010.p019a}}</ref> Other predicted oxidation states include +2, +4, and +6; +4 is expected to be the most usual oxidation state of unbihexium.<ref name=BFricke/> The presence of electrons in g-orbitals, which do not exist in the ground state electron configuration of any currently known element, should allow presently unknown [[orbital hybridisation|hybrid]] orbitals to form and influence the chemistry of the superactinides in new ways, although the absence of ''g'' electrons in known elements makes predicting their chemistry more difficult.<ref name=Fricke/>

In the later superactinides, the oxidation states should become lower. By element 132, the predominant most stable oxidation state will be only +6; this is further reduced to +3 and +4 by element 144, and at the end of the superactinide series it will be only +2 (and possibly even 0) because the 6f shell, which is being filled at that point, is deep inside the electron cloud and the 8s and 8p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons are bound too strongly to be chemically active. The 5g shell should be filled at element 144 and the 6f shell at around element 154, and at this region of the superactinides the 8p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons are bound so strongly that they are no longer active chemically, so that only a few electrons can participate in chemical reactions. Calculations by Fricke ''et al.'' predict that at element 154, the 6f shell is full and there are no d- or other electron [[wave function]]s outside the chemically inactive 8s and 8p<sub>1/2</sub> shells. This would cause element 154 to be very [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]], so that it may exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases.<ref name=Fricke/><ref name=Haire/>

Similarly to the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], there should be a superactinide contraction in the superactinide series where the [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the superactinides are smaller than expected. In the [[lanthanide]]s, the contraction is about 4.4&nbsp;pm per element; in the [[actinide]]s, it is about 3&nbsp;pm per element. The contraction is larger in the lanthanides than in the actinides due to the greater localization of the 4f wave function as compared to the 5f wave function. Comparisons with the wave functions of the outer electrons of the lanthanides, actinides, and superactinides lead to a prediction of a contraction of about 2&nbsp;pm per element in the superactinides; although this is smaller than the contractions in the lanthanides and actinides, its total effect is larger due to the fact that 32 electrons are filled in the deeply buried 5g and 6f shells, instead of just 14 electrons being filled in the 4f and 5f shells in the lanthanides and actinides respectively.<ref name=Fricke/>

[[Pekka Pyykk<U+00F6>]] divides these superactinides into three series: a 5g series (elements 121 to 138), an 8p<sub>1/2</sub> series (elements 139 to 140), and a 6f series (elements 141 to 155), although noting that there would be a great deal of overlapping between energy levels and that the 6f, 7d, or 8p<sub>1/2</sub> orbitals could well also be occupied in the early superactinide atoms or ions. He also expects that they would behave more like "super[[lanthanide]]s", in the sense that the 5g electrons would mostly be chemically inactive, similarly to how only one or two 4f electrons in each lanthanide are ever ionized in chemical compounds. He also predicted that the possible oxidation states of the superactinides might rise very high in the 6f series, to values such as +12 in element 148.<ref name="PT172">{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykk<U+00F6>|first1=Pekka|authorlink=Pekka Pyykk<U+00F6>|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z<U+2264> 172, based on Dirac<U+2013>Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161<U+2013>8|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P }}</ref>

====7d transition metals====
The transition metals in period 8 are expected to be element 156 to 164. Although the 8s and 8p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons are bound so strongly in these elements that they should not be able to take part in any chemical reactions, the 9s and 9p<sub>1/2</sub> levels are expected to be readily available for hybridization such that these elements will still behave chemically like their lighter [[homology (chemistry)|homologues]] in the periodic table, showing the same oxidation states as they do, in contrast to earlier predictions which predicted the period 8 transition metals to have main oxidation states two less than those of their lighter congeners.<ref name=Fricke/><ref name=Haire/>

The noble metals of this series of transition metals are not expected to be as noble as their lighter homologues, due to the absence of an outer ''s'' shell for shielding and also because the 7d shell is strongly split into two subshells due to relativistic effects. This causes the first ionization energies of the 7d transition metals to be smaller than those of their lighter congeners.<ref name=Fricke/><ref name=Haire/><ref name=BFricke/>

Calculations predict that the 7d electrons of element 164 (unhexquadium) should participate very readily in chemical reactions, so that unhexquadium should be able to show stable +6 and +4 oxidation states in addition to the normal +2 state in [[aqueous solution]]s with strong [[ligand]]s. Unhexquadium should thus be able to form compounds like Uhq([[carbonyl|CO]])<sub>4</sub>, Uhq([[phosphorus trifluoride|PF<sub>3</sub>]])<sub>4</sub> (both [[tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]]), and {{chem|Uhq([[cyanide|CN]])|2|2-}} ([[linear molecular geometry|linear]]), which is very different behavior from that of [[lead]], which unhexquadium would be a heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] of if not for relativistic effects. Nevertheless, the divalent state would be the main one in aqueous solution, and unhexquadium(II) should behave more similarly to lead than unhexquadium(IV) and unhexquadium(VI).<ref name="Haire"/><ref name=BFricke>{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=Burkhard |year=1975 |title=Superheavy elements: a prediction of their chemical and physical properties |journal=Recent Impact of Physics on Inorganic Chemistry |volume=21 |pages=89<U+2013>144 |doi=10.1007/BFb0116498 |url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225672062_Superheavy_elements_a_prediction_of_their_chemical_and_physical_properties |accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>

Unhexquadium should be a [[hardness|soft]] metal like mercury, and metallic unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond [[covalent bond|covalently]]. It is also expected to be a soft [[Lewis acid]] and have [[Ahrlands softness parameter]] close to 4&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]]. It should also have some similarities to [[ununoctium]] as well as to the other group 12 elements.<ref name="Haire"/> Unhexquadium should be at most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685&nbsp;kJ/mol, comparable to that of [[molybdenum]].<ref name="Fricke"/><ref name=BFricke/> Due to the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions]], unhexquadium should have an metallic radius of only 158&nbsp;[[picometer|pm]], very close to that of the much lighter [[magnesium]], despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]], about 19.5&nbsp;times as much as that of magnesium.<ref name="Fricke"/> This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46&nbsp;g<U+00B7>cm<sup><U+2212>3</sup>, over twice that of [[osmium]], currently the most dense element known, at 22.61&nbsp;g<U+00B7>cm<sup><U+2212>3</sup>; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47&nbsp;g<U+00B7>cm<sup><U+2212>3</sup>).<ref name="Fricke">{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=B. |last2=Greiner |first2=W. |last3=Waber |first3=J.

Theoretical interest in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it, especially the isotope <sup>482</sup>Uhq (with 164 [[proton]]s and 318 [[neutron]]s), would be at the center of a hypothetical second [[island of stability]] (the first being centered around <sup>306</sup>[[unbibium|Ubb]]).<ref name=Kratz>

====Elements 165 to 172====
Elements 165 (unhexpentium) and 166 (unhexhexium) should behave as normal [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s when in the +1 and +2 oxidation states respectively. The 9s electrons should have ionization energies comparable to those of the 3s electrons of [[sodium]] and [[magnesium]], due to relativistic effects causing the 9s electrons to be much more strongly bound than non-relativistic calculations would predict. Elements 165 and 166 should normally exhibit the +1 and +2 oxidation states respectively; however, the ionization energies of the 7d electrons are low enough to allow higher oxidation states like +3 and +4 to also occur quite commonly.<ref name=Fricke/><ref name=Haire>{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss|editor2-first = Norman M.| editor2-last = Edelstein| editor3-last = Fuger|editor3-first = Jean| last = Haire|first = Richard G.| chapter = Transactinides and the future elements| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]| year = 2006| isbn = 1-4020-3555-1| location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands| edition = 3rd| ref = CITEREFHaire2006}}</ref>

In elements 167 to 172, the 9p<sub>1/2</sub> and 8p<sub>3/2</sub> shells will be filled. Their energy [[eigenvalue]]s are so close together that they behaves as one combined ''p'' shell, similar to the non-relativistic 2p and 3p shells. Thus, the [[inert pair effect]] does not occur and the most common oxidation states of elements 167 to 170 should be +3, +4, +5, and +6 respectively. Element 171 (unseptunium) is expected to be a [[halogen]], showing various oxidation states ranging from <U+2013>1 to +7. Its electron affinity should be 3.0&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]], allowing it to form a hydrogen halide, HUsu. The Usu<sup><U+2212></sup> ion is expected to be a [[HSAB|soft base]], comparable to [[iodide]] (I<sup><U+2212></sup>). Element 172 (unseptbium) should be a [[noble gas]] with chemical behaviour similar to that of [[xenon]], as their ionization energies should be very similar (Xe, 1170.4&nbsp;kJ/mol; Usb, 1090.3&nbsp;kJ/mol). The only main difference between them is that element 172, unlike xenon, is expected to be a [[liquid]] or a [[solid]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]] due to its much higher atomic weight.<ref name=Fricke/> Unseptbium should be a strong [[Lewis acid]], forming fluorides and oxides, similarly to its lighter congener xenon.<ref name=BFricke>{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=Burkhard |year=1975 |title=Superheavy elements: a prediction of their chemical and physical properties |journal=Recent Impact of Physics on Inorganic Chemistry |volume=21 |pages=89<U+2013>144 |doi=10.1007/BFb0116498 |url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225672062_Superheavy_elements_a_prediction_of_their_chemical_and_physical_properties |accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> Because of this analogy of elements 165<U+2013>172 to periods 2 and 3, Fricke ''et al.'' considered them to form a ninth period of the periodic table, while the eighth period was taken by them to end at the noble metal element 164. This ninth period would be similar to the second and third period in that it should have no transition metals.<ref name=BFricke/>

===="Eka-superactinides"====
Immediately after element 172 (unseptbium), the first noble gas after [[ununoctium|element 118]] (the last period 7 element), another long transition series like the [[superactinide]]s should begin, filling the 6g, 7f, 8d, and perhaps 6h shells. These electrons would be very loosely bound, rendering extremely high oxidation states possibly easy to reach.<ref name=BFricke>{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=Burkhard |year=1975 |title=Superheavy elements: a prediction of their chemical and physical properties |journal=Recent Impact of Physics on Inorganic Chemistry |volume=21 |pages=89<U+2013>144 |doi=10.1007/BFb0116498 |url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225672062_Superheavy_elements_a_prediction_of_their_chemical_and_physical_properties |accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref> This series may be termed the [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-superactinides, as it is the next long transition series in the periodic table after the superactinides.

The ground-state [[electron configuration]] of element 184 (unoctquadium) is expected to be [Usb]6g<sup>5</sup>7f<sup>4</sup>8d<sup>3</sup>: only the 8d and 7f electrons should be chemically active, with possible reasons being small radial extension and large binding energy. The absence of 6h<sub>11/2</sub>, 10s, and 10p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons from this ground-state electron configuration suggests that it would behave chemically simpler than the early superactinides, and more similar to [[uranium]] or [[neptunium]]. As more electrons are ionized, the number of 6g electrons in the unoctquadium ion will increase: these are buried in the electron core and would not participate in chemical reactions, but the 7f electrons could. Extrapolation from uranium suggests that the +4 state would be the most stable in aqueous solution, with +5 and +6 readily obtainable in solid compounds. Higher states would necessitate the ionization of the deeply buried 6g electrons and are probably unlikely: furthermore, their binding energy becomes a lot higher as more electrons are removed. This effect is so important that the 9s and 9p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons, part of the closed [Usb] electron core, would enter the 6g subshell in the +8 oxidation state and higher. This suggests that the multitude of simultaneously filling outer electron shells as one proceeds down a long transition series may not lead to exceptionally high or exotic oxidation states, nor should it lead to anomalously low increases in ionization energy.<ref name=Fricke/><ref name=BFricke/>

===Nuclear properties===
The first [[island of stability]] is expected to be centered around [[unbibium]]-306 (with 122 protons and 184 neutrons),<ref name=Kratz>

Calculations according to the [[Hartree<U+2013>Fock method|Hartree<U+2013>Fock]]<U+2013>Bogoliubov Method using the non-relativistic Skyrme interaction have proposed Z=126 as a [[nuclear shell model|closed proton shell]]. In this region of the periodic table, N=184 and N=196 have been suggested as [[nuclear shell model|closed neutron shell]]s. Therefore the isotopes of most interest are <sup>310</sup>Ubh and <sup>322</sup>Ubh, for these might be considerably longer-lived than other isotopes. Unbihexium, having a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] of [[proton]]s, is predicted to be more stable than other elements in this region, and may have [[nuclear isomer]]s with very long [[half-life|half-lives]].<ref name="emsley2"/>

==Attempts to synthesize still undiscovered elements==
The only period 8 elements that have had synthesis attempts were elements 119, 120, 122, 124, 126, and 127. So far, none of these synthesis attempts were successful.

===Ununennium===
The synthesis of ununennium was attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of [[einsteinium]]-254 with [[calcium]]-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California:
:<math>\,^{254}_{99}\mathrm{Es} + \,^{48}_{20}\mathrm{Ca} \to \,^{302}_{119}\mathrm{Uue} ^{*} </math>
No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 [[barn (unit)|nb]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Search for superheavy elements using <sup>48</sup>Ca + <sup>254</sup>Es<sup>g</sup> reaction|author=R.

===Unbinilium===
Attempts to date to synthesize the element using fusion reactions at low excitation energy have met with failure, although there are reports that the fission of nuclei of unbinilium at very high excitation has been successfully measured, indicating a strong shell effect at Z=120.
In March<U+2013>April 2007, the synthesis of unbinilium was attempted at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions]] in [[Dubna]] by bombarding a [[plutonium]]-244 target with [[iron]]-58 [[ion]]s.<ref>[http://www.jinr.ru/plan/ptp-2007/e751004.htm THEME03-5-1004-94/2009]</ref> Initial analysis revealed that no atoms of element 120 were produced providing a limit of 400 [[barn (unit)|fb]] for the cross section at the energy studied.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Phys.

:<math>\,^{244}_{94}\mathrm{Pu} + \,^{58}_{26}\mathrm{Fe} \to \,^{302}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn} ^{*} \to \ \mathit{fission\ only}</math>

The Russian team are planning to upgrade their facilities before attempting the reaction again.<ref name=Duellmann>>http://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/kollo/Duellmann_FIAS-Kolloquium.pdf</ref>

In April 2007, the team at [[Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r Schwerionenforschung|GSI]] attempted to create unbinilium using [[uranium]]-238 and [[nickel]]-64:<ref name=Duellmann/>

:<math>\,^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U} + \,^{64}_{28}\mathrm{Ni} \to \,^{302}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn} ^{*} \to \ \mathit{fission\ only}</math>

No atoms were detected providing a limit of 1.6 pb on the cross section at the energy provided. The GSI repeated the experiment with higher sensitivity in three separate runs from April<U+2013>May 2007, Jan<U+2013>March 2008, and Sept<U+2013>Oct 2008, all with negative results and providing a cross section limit of 90 fb.<ref name=Duellmann/>

In June<U+2013>July 2010, scientists at the GSI attempted the fusion reaction:<ref name=Duellmann/>

:<math>\,^{248}_{96}\mathrm{Cm} + \,^{54}_{24}\mathrm{Cr} \to \,^{302}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn} ^{*} </math>

They were unable to detect any atoms but exact details are not currently available.<ref name=Duellmann/>

In August<U+2013>October 2011, a different team at the GSI using the TASCA facility tried the new reaction:<ref name=Duellmann/>

:<math>\,^{249}_{98}\mathrm{Cf} + \,^{50}_{22}\mathrm{Ti} \to \,^{299}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn} ^{*} </math>

Results from this experiment are not yet available.<ref name=Duellmann/>
In 2008, the team at GANIL, France, described the results from a new technique which attempts to measure the fission [[half-life]] of a compound nucleus at high excitation energy, since the yields are significantly higher than from neutron evaporation channels. It is also a useful method for probing the effects of shell closures on the survivability of compound nuclei in the super-heavy region, which can indicate the exact position of the next proton shell (Z=114, 120, 124, or 126).
The team studied the nuclear fusion reaction between uranium ions and a target of natural nickel:

::::<math>\,^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U} + \,^{nat}_{28}\mathrm{Ni} \to \,^{296,298,299,300,302}\mathrm{Ubn} ^{*} \to \ \mathit{fission}.</math>

The results indicated that nuclei of unbinilium were produced at high (~70 MeV) excitation energy which underwent fission with measurable half-lives > 10<sup><U+2212>18</sup> s. Although very short, the ability to measure such a process indicates a strong shell effect at Z=120. At lower excitation energy (see neutron evaporation), the effect of the shell will be enhanced and ground-state nuclei can be expected to have relatively long half-lives. This result could partially explain the relatively long half-life of <sup>294</sup>[[ununoctium|Uuo]] measured in experiments at Dubna. Similar experiments have indicated a similar phenomenon at Z=124 (see [[unbiquadium]]) but not for [[flerovium]], suggesting that the next proton shell does in fact lie at Z>120.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/Physics.1.12|title=How stable are the heaviest nuclei?|year=2008|author=Natowitz, Joseph|journal=Physics|volume=1|pages=12|bibcode = 2008PhyOJ...1...12N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Phys.

===Unbibium===
The first attempt to synthesize unbibium was performed in 1972 by [[Georgy Flerov|Flerov]] ''et al.'' at [[JINR]], using the hot fusion reaction:<ref name="emsley"/>

:<math>\,^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U} + \,^{66}_{30}\mathrm{Zn} \to \,^{304}_{122}\mathrm{Ubb} ^{*} \to \ \mbox{no atoms}.</math>

No atoms were detected and a yield limit of 5 [[Barn (unit)|mb]] (5,000,000,000 [[barn (unit)|pb]]) was measured. Current results (see [[flerovium]]) have shown that the sensitivity of this experiment was too low by at least 6 orders of magnitude.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2000, the [[Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) performed a very similar experiment with much higher sensitivity:<ref name="emsley">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7|page=588}}</ref>

:<math>\,^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U} + \,^{70}_{30}\mathrm{Zn} \to \,^{308}_{122}\mathrm{Ubb} ^{*} \to \ \mbox{no atoms}.</math>

These results indicate that the synthesis of such heavier elements remains a significant challenge and further improvements of beam intensity and experimental efficiency is required. The sensitivity should be increased to 1 [[barn (unit)|fb]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Another unsuccessful attempt to synthesize unbibium was carried out in 1978 at the GSI, where a natural [[erbium]] target was bombarded with [[xenon-136]] ions:<ref name="emsley"/>

:<math>\,^{nat}_{68}\mathrm{Er} + \,^{136}_{54}\mathrm{Xe} \to \,^{298,300,302,303,304,306}\mathrm{Ubb} ^{*} \to \ \mbox{no atoms}.</math>

The two attempts in the 1970s to synthesize unbibium were caused by research investigating whether superheavy elements could potentially be naturally occurring.<ref name="emsley"/>
Several experiments have been performed between 2000-2004 at the Flerov laboratory of Nuclear Reactions studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus <sup>306</sup>Ubb. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely <sup>248</sup>Cm + <sup>58</sup>Fe and <sup>242</sup>Pu + <sup>64</sup>Ni.<ref name="emsley"/> The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling [[nuclear shell model|closed shell]] nuclei such as <sup>132</sup>Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between <sup>48</sup>Ca and <sup>58</sup>Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of <sup>58</sup>Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.<ref>see Flerov lab annual reports 2000<U+2013>2004 inclusive http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/Reports_eng_arh.html</ref>

===Unbiquadium===
In a series of experiments, scientists at GANIL have attempted to measure the direct and delayed fission of compound nuclei of elements with Z=114, 120, and 124 in order to probe [[nuclear shell|shell]] effects in this region and to pinpoint the next spherical proton shell. This is because having complete nuclear shells (or, equivalently, having a [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] of [[proton]]s or [[neutron]]s) would confer more stability on the nuclei of such superheavy elements, thus moving closer to the [[island of stability]]. In 2006, with full results published in 2008, the team provided results from a reaction involving the bombardment of a natural germanium target with uranium ions:

:<math>\,^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U} +  \,^{nat}_{32}\mathrm{Ge} \to \,^{308,310,311,312,314}\mathrm{Ubq} ^{*} \to \   fission.</math>

The team reported that they had been able to identify compound nuclei fissioning with half-lives > 10<sup><U+2212>18</sup> s. This result suggests a strong stabilizing effect at Z=124 and points to the next proton shell at Z>120, not at Z=114 as previously thought. A compound nucleus is a loose combination of [[nucleon]]s that have not arranged themselves into nuclear shells yet. It has no internal structure and is held together only by the collision forces between the target and projectile nuclei. It is estimated that it requires around 10<sup><U+2212>14</sup>&nbsp;s for the nucleons to arrange themselves into nuclear shells, at which point the compound nucleus becomes an [[nuclide]], and this number is used by [[IUPAC]] as the minimum [[half-life]] a claimed isotope must have to potentially be recognised as being discovered. Thus, the GANIL experiments do not count as a discovery of element 124.<ref name="emsley">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7|page=590}}</ref>

===Unbihexium===
The first and only attempt to synthesize unbihexium, which was unsuccessful, was performed in 1971 at [[CERN]] by [[Ren<U+00E9> Bimbot]] and John M. Alexander<!--don't link; the article titled "John M. Alexander" goes to a different John M. Alexander--> using the hot fusion reaction:<ref name="emsley"/>

A high energy [[alpha particle]] was observed and taken as possible evidence for the synthesis of unbihexium. Recent research{{which|date=October 2011}} suggests that this is highly unlikely as the sensitivity of experiments performed in 1971 would have been several orders of magnitude too low according to current understanding.

===Unbiseptium===
Unbiseptium has had one failed attempt at [[Synthetic element|synthesis]] in 1978 at the Darmstadt UNILAC accelerator by bombarding a natural [[tantalum]] target with [[xenon]] ions:<ref name="emsley">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7|page=593}}</ref>

==Possible natural occurrence==
On April 24, 2008, a group led by [[Amnon Marinov]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] claimed to have found single atoms of unbibium-292 in naturally occurring [[thorium]] deposits at an abundance of between 10<sup><U+2212>11</sup> and 10<sup><U+2212>12</sup>, relative to thorium.<ref name=arxiv/> The claim of Marinov ''et al.'' was criticized by a part of the scientific community, and Marinov says he has submitted the article to the journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Nature Physics]]'' but both turned it down without sending it for peer review.<ref>[[Royal Society of Chemistry]], "[http://rsc.org/chemistryworld/News/2008/May/02050802.asp Heaviest element claim criticised]", Chemical World.</ref> The unbibium-292 atoms were claimed to be [[superdeformation|superdeformed]] or [[hyperdeformation|hyperdeformed]] [[nuclear isomer|isomers]], with a half-life of at least 100 million years.<ref name="emsley"/>

It was suggested in 1976 that [[primordial element|primordial]] superheavy elements (mainly [[livermorium]], [[unbiquadium]], unbihexium, and [[unbiseptium]]) could be a cause of unexplained radiation damage in minerals. This prompted many researchers to search for it in nature from 1976 to 1983. Some claimed that they had detected alpha particles with the right energies to cause the damage observed, supporting the presence of unbihexium, while some claimed that no unbihexium had been detected. However, the possible extent of primordial unbihexium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.<ref name="emsley2">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements|edition=New|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-960563-7|page=592}}</ref>

}}</ref> that a simplistic interpretation of the [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[Dirac equation]] runs into problems with electron orbitals at ''Z'' > 1/<U+03B1> <U+2248> 137 as described in the sections below, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond [[untriseptium]], and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals therefore breaks down at this point. On the other hand, a more rigorous analysis calculates the limit to be ''Z'' <U+2248> 173, and also that this limit would not actually spell the end of the periodic table.

====Bohr model====
The [[Bohr model]] exhibits difficulty for atoms with atomic number greater than 137, for the speed of an electron in a [[Atomic orbital|1s electron orbital]], ''v'', is given by

:<math>v = Z \alpha c \approx \frac{Z c}{137.036}</math>

where ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]], and ''<U+03B1>'' is the [[fine structure constant]], a measure of the strength of electromagnetic interactions.<ref>{{cite book

}}</ref>  Under this approximation, any element with an atomic number of greater than 137 would require 1s electrons to be traveling faster than ''c'', the [[speed of light]]. Hence the non-relativistic Bohr model is clearly inaccurate when applied to such an element.

====Relativistic Dirac equation====
The [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[Dirac equation]] gives the ground state energy as

:<math>E=\frac{m c^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\frac{m c^2}{\sqrt{1-Z^2 \alpha^2}},</math>

where ''m'' is the rest mass of the electron.  For ''Z''&nbsp;>&nbsp;137, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory, rather than bound, and there is no gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the [[Klein paradox]].<ref>
