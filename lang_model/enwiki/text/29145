'''Trelissick Garden''' is a [[garden]] in the ownership of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and situated in [[Feock, Cornwall]], near [[Truro, Cornwall|Truro]], [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]].
 
==The Trust==
The garden has been in the ownership of the National Trust since 1955 when it was donated by [[Ida Copeland]]. Mr and Mrs Copeland planted many of the species that flourish in the mild Cornish air, including the [[rhododendron]]s and [[azalea]]s which are now such a feature of the garden, [[hydrangea]]s, [[camellia]]s and flowering cherries, and exotics such as the [[ginkgo]] and various species of palm. They also ensured that the blossoms they nurtured had a wider, if unknowing audience. Mr Ronald Copeland was chairman and later managing director of his family's business, the [[Spode]] china factory, and flowers grown at Trelissick were used as models for those painted on ware produced at the works.

The Copelands' family crest, a horse's head, now decorates the weathervane on the turret of the stable block, a pair to the [[Davies-Gilbert|Gilbert]] squirrels on the Victorian Gothic water tower, an echo of the family who lived here in the second half of the 19th century (their ancestor, Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]], was lost at sea in his tiny ship ''Squirrel'' after discovering [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]).

The garden is noted for its rare shrubs. It offers a large park, woodland walks, views over the [[estuary]] of the [[River Fal]] and [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]].

==Special plants==
* Trelissick Garden is the home of the [[NCCPG National Plant Collection|National Plant Collection]]s of [[photinia]]s and [[Azara (plant)|azara]]s.
