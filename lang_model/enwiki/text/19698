'''Moss Airport, Rygge''' {{Airport codes|RYG|ENRY}} ({{lang-no|Moss lufthavn, Rygge}}) is an [[international airport]] serving [[Oslo]] and [[Eastern Norway]], located in [[Rygge]]. It is both a [[regional airport]] for [[<U+00D8>stfold]] as well as an airport for [[low-cost airline]]s. The airport is located {{convert|10|km}} outside [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] and {{convert|60|km}} outside Oslo and is owned and operated by the private company Rygge Sivile Lufthavn AS. It is co-located with [[Rygge Air Station]], operated by the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]], who also own the land and runway and operate the [[air traffic control]]. In addition to charter flights, the airport is a base for [[Ryanair]] and [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]].

The airport opened on 8 October 2007, but did not officially opened until 14 February 2008, when regular scheduled services started. In March 2010, Ryanair established a base at the airport, and has moved most of its Oslo-bound flights from [[Sandefjord Airport, Torp]]. The airport has a capacity for 2 million passengers per year, but cannot reach this because of [[concession (contract)|concession]] limit of 21,000 annual air movements. The airport had 619,000 passengers in 2009. Moss Airport, Rygge has an [[airport rail link]], via a shuttle bus, at [[Rygge Station]].

==History==
The first aerodrome at Rygge was built in 1942 and 1943, but was located about {{convert|2|km|sp=us}} west from the current runway. The aerodrome was closed in 1945, but reopened in 1949 as a military aviation school, although the school only remained for two years. In 1952 it was decided that Rygge was to become a military air station which met [[NATO]] specifications. This included the [[expropriation]] of {{convert|600|ha}} of land, costing NOK 12 million. The new Rygge Main Air Station was established on 15 September 1954, after investments of NOK 127 million. The old airport was closed and remained a camp until it was closed in 2003. Rygge Main Air Station hosted the [[No. 332 Squadron RNoAF|332 Squadron]], and later the [[No. 336 Squadron RNoAF|336 Squadron]] and the [[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330 Squadron]]. From 2003, the figher jets were moved from Rygge to [[Bod<U+00F8> Main Air Station]].<ref name=mil />

[[File:Rygge Air Station control tower.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[control towner]] at Rygge in 1983]]
On 8 October 1998, the main airport serving Oslo and Eastern Norway was moved from [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]] to [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]].{{cn}} Several other locations, including [[Hurum]], [[Hob<U+00F8>l]] and [[<U+00C5>s]], had been considered, all which were located closer to Oslo and the [[Oslofjord]] area. The choice of location was controversial, in part because Gardermoen would be located further than Fornebu from among other things <U+00D8>stfold and Follo.<ref>{{cite book |title=Oslo lufthavn Gardermoen: Porten til Norge |last=Bredal |first=Dag |year=1998 |publisher=Schibsted |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-516-1719-7 |page=15}}</ref> In 1998, a report was made by SCC Trafikon which concluded that by building a civilian section at Rygge Air Station, it would be possible to generate 130,000 passengers per year, of which 40,000 would be charter travels. This was a higher passenger potential than Torp.  Several regional airlines, such as [[Teddy Air]], [[Air Stord]] and [[Coast Air]], all stated that they could be interested in routes from Rygge, while [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Braathens]] and [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] stated that they were not interested in flying from the airport. The idea was initially supported by local parliamentarians, <U+00D8>stfold County Council and the [[Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise]]. The latter stated that the most important air routes were those to Gardermoen and Torp, while the Trafikon report recommended routes to Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and Copenhagen.<ref>{{cite news |title=Flyselskapene i k<U+00F8> for Rygge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |date=24 August 1998 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In February 1999, [[Minister of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Minister of Transport and Communications]] [[Dag Jostein Fj<U+00E6>rvoll]] stated that he supported the opening of civilian traffic from Rygge.<ref>{{cite news |title=Liten interesse hos flyselskaper for Rygge |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=18 February 1999 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Estimates from then were for an investment of 80 million [[Norwegian krone]] for a capacity of 150,000 annual passengers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sivil flyplass p<U+00E5> Rygge vil koste 60-80 millioner  |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=19 February 1999 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> However, the plans allowed for further expansion to 500,000 annual passengers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rygge <U+00E5>pner for 500 000 passasjerer |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |date=19 February 1999 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In July, the operating company Rygge Sivile Lufthavn was established. Owners were [[Borregaard]] (46.7%), <U+00D8>stfold County Municipality (20%), [[M. Peterson & S<U+00F8>n]] (16.6%) and [[Capricorn Invest]] (16.6%). The share capital was initially NOK 3 million. Egil Ulleb<U+00F8> was appointed the company's chair. According to the plans, the company would need NOK 50 million in share capital, and the [[Norwegian Civil Airport Administration]] was intended to own 34% of the airport.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rygge klar for takeoff |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |last=Larsen |first=Trygve |date=3 July 1999 |page=9 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

On 12 January 2000, [[K<U+00F8>benhavns Lufthavne]], which operates among other things [[Copenhagen Airport]], bought 33.3% of the shares in Rygge Sivile Lufthavn. The company stated that they had invited the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration to purchase part of the company, but that no decision had been made by the government agency. The company stated that they were therefore forced to invite a foreign airport operate to purchase part of the company to have sufficient competence in airport operations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vil konkurrere med Gardermoen: Kastrup kj<U+00F8>per seg inn i Rygge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Kluge |first=Lars |date=13 January 2000 |page=2 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In December, the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration stated that they were negative to the plans for civilian traffic at Rygge. The administration operates with the model that the large airports, in particular Gardermoen, make a profit, which is used to finance the deficits at smaller airports. The administration stated that establishing a civilian airport at Rygge would undermine the financial structure of Norwegian airports and would breach the political presumptions for constructing Gardermoen. If the administration was to be able to complete on price with Rygge, the state would have to give the necessary grants to cover the deficits at other airports. At the same time, Torp was required to pay their own [[air traffic control]] costs, which until then had been covered by the administration.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sivil Rygge-flyplass m<U+00F8>ter motstand |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Dahl |first=Flemming |date=17 December 2000 |page=7 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In September 2001, the [[Norwegian Competition Authority]] supported the airport, stating that it would allow more competition on international flights from Norway, and could make it easier to establish domestic competition in the lieu of Scandinavian Airline's take-over of Braathens.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tungt for Rygge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Dahl |first=Flemming |date=12 September 2001 |page=44 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

[[File:F16 take-off at Rygge Air Station.jpg|thumb|Two [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s taking off from Rygge]]
In June 2002, [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] stated that they would start flights from Rygge, should the airport be built. At the same time, the military and the airport company were discussing where the optimal location for the terminal should be. Once decided, the Rygge Sivile Lufthavn hoped to send an application for a [[concession (contract)|concession]] to the [[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Norway)|Ministry of Transport and Communications]].<ref name=nasdist>{{cite news |title=Flere flyselskaper vil starte flyvninger fra Rygge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |date=22 June 2002 |page=2 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In March 2003, [[Norwegian Labour Party|Rygge Labour Party]] stated they were opposed to the civilian airport, because of the local noise concerns.<ref>{{cite news |title=Neppe sivilfly p<U+00E5> Rygge |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |date=29 March 2003 |page=53 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In May, the airport company confirmed that Ryanair, which was using Torp, had shown interest in using Rygge.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lavprisflyselskaper til Rygge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |date=15 May 2003 |page=32 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In June, the Rygge Sivile Lufthavn stated that had changed their strategy, and that they now were going to primarily target [[low-cost airline]]s. The airport hoped to initially establish routes to Copenhagen, Stockholm, London and Amsterdam, and that international destinations would be prioritized before domestic destinations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rygge lufthavn satser p<U+00E5> lavprisfly |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |date=25 June 2003 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In February 2004, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Norway|Civil Aviation Authority]] stated that 51 issues needed to be resolved before civilian traffic would be permitted.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sivil flytrafikk fra Rygge utsettes |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |date=15 February 2004 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

In a report published by the ministry in March 2004, it was estimated that the airport would have 700,000 to 800,000 passengers per year, making it th eighth largest in the country, and could have 1.3 million passengers by 2030.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ser etter 800 000 p<U+00E5> Rygge  |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |date=14 March 2004 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In a reply, the [[Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries]] stated that they were opposed to establishing a new airport, and stated that there were sufficient airports in Eastern Norway. They stated that an airport outside Avinor (the new name for the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration) would result lower profits at Gardermoen, and thus higher fees for the rest of the airports. In addition, the airlines would have higher costs having to operate to additional airports in Eastern Norway.<ref>{{cite news |title=Norske flyselskaper skyr Rygge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Enghaug |first=P<U+00E5>l |date=25 April 2004 |page=4 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The proejct was also met with local protests. In particular, they were concerned about the emission to the lake [[Vansj<U+00F8>]], alternatively to a [[Ramsar site]] in [[Kurefjorden]], and the local noise pollution, with the airport being located close to Moss.<ref name=vansjo>{{cite news |title=Sivil luftfart truer milj<U+00F8>et |work=[[Dagsavisen]] |last=Sandb<U+00E6>k |first=<U+00D8>rnulf |last2=Abrahamsen |first2=Anders |date=28 August 2004 |page=52 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> [[Natur og Ungdom]] were also opposed to the airport, stating that it would increase the amount of air traffic and thus result in an increase in [[greenhouse gas]]es.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stans Rygge Lufthavn!  |work=[[Klassekampen]] |date=25 May 2006 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>

K<U+00F8>benhavns Lufthavne sold its ownership in the company during 2004, because they were not satisfied with the progress.<ref name=skjebne /> On 18 November 2004, the air force received the necessary concessions from the ministry to establish a civilian section. The concession contained a limit of 750,000 passengers per year, and had a duration of 10 years. It also requires the airport to be open from 07 to 23 every day and permit [[general aviation]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Klarsignal for Moss Lufthavn Rygge |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |date=18 November 2004 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Negotiations between the air force and Rygge Sivile Lufthavn started in June 2005 to establish an agreement regarding operations and financing.<ref name=skjebne>{{cite news |title=Skjebne-time for Rygge |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Dahl |first=Flemming |date=9 May 2005 |page=3 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> In September, the air force and the company came to an agreement regarding the company's compensation to the military.<ref>{{cite news |title=Enighet om bruken av Rygge lufthavn |work=[[Aftenposten]] |last=Dahl |first=Flemming |date=15 September 2005 |page=13 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The agreement was approved by the [[Ministry of Defence (Norway)|Ministry of Defence]] in January 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Klart for Moss lufthavn Rygge |work=[[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |date=7 January 2006 |page=8 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> On 22 February, all permissions had been granted, and the company was able to take an investment decision.

Instead, the airport was limited to 15,000 air movements per year.
