On February 23, 2013, officials from both Florida State and [[Pittsburgh]], as well as the commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference announced that the Seminoles and the Panthers would open the season at [[Heinz Field]] on [[Labor Day]] in what would be Pittsburgh's first game as a member of the ACC.<ref>{{cite news |title=Florida State to Play Pittsburgh on Labor Day|agency=FBSchedules |publisher=FBSchedules.com |url=http://www.fbschedules.com/2013/02/florida-state-to-play-pittsburgh-on-labor-day-2013/|date=February 23, 2013|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}</ref>

In the game that would serve as the debut of [[Jameis Winston]] as [[quarterback]], the Seminoles had to overcome an early deficit to defeat the Panthers, 41<U+2013>13.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jameis Winston throws for 4 TDs as FSU dismantles Pitt|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=332450221|agency=Associated Press|work=[[ESPN]]|date=September 2, 2013 |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref> After Pitt scored on their first possession to take a touchdown lead, Florida State quickly responded on their first drive with a touchdown pass from Winston to Nick O'Leary to tie the game.

Following Pitt's touchdown on the first drive, Florida State kept them out of the end zone for the remainder of the game and held the Panthers to just two field goals. After a slow start for the defense, Pitt was held to only 297 yards of offense and one touchdown.
