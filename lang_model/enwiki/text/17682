'''Izaak Walton''' ([[August 9]], [[1593]] - [[December 15]], [[1683]]) was an [[England|English writer]], author of ''The Compleat Angler''.

==Biography==
Walton was born at [[Stafford]]; the register of his baptism gives his father's name as Jervis, and nothing more is known of his parentage.

He settled in [[London]] as an [[iron]]monger, and at first had one of the small shops, in the upper story of Gresham's [[Royal Exchange|Royal Burse or Exchange]] in [[Cornhill]]. In [[1614]] he had a shop in [[Fleet Street]], two doors west of [[Chancery Lane]]. Here, in the parish of St Dunstan's, he gained the friendship of Dr. [[John Donne]], then [[vicar]] of that church. His first wife, married in December [[1626]], was Rachel Floud, a great-great-niece of [[Thomas Cranmer|Archbishop Cranmer]]. She died in [[1640]]. He married again soon after, his second wife being Anne Ken &mdash; the pastoral ''Kenna'' of ''The Angler's Wish''&mdash;step-sister of [[Thomas Ken]], afterwards [[bishop of Bath and Wells]].

After the Royalist defeat at [[battle of Marston Moor|Marston Moor]], Walton retired from business. He had bought some land near his birthplace, Stafford, and he went to live there; but in [[1650]] he was again living in [[Clerkenwell]]. In [[1653]] came out the first edition of his famous book, ''The Compleat Angler''. His second wife died in [[1662]], and was buried in [[Worcester Cathedral]], where there is a monument to her memory. One of his daughters married Dr. Hawkins, a [[prebendary]] of [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]].

==Fishing==
The last forty years of his long life seem to have been spent in ideal leisure and occupation, the old man traveling here and there, visiting eminent clergymen and others who enjoyed [[fishing]], compiling the biographies of congenial spirits, and collecting here a little and there a little for the enlargement of his famous treatise. After [[1662]] he found a home at [[Farnham Castle]] with [[George Morley]], [[bishop of Winchester]], to whom he dedicated his ''Life of George Herbert'' and also that of [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]]; and from time to time he visited [[Charles Cotton]] in his fishing house on the [[River Dove, Derbyshire|Dove]]. He died in his daughter's house at Winchester, and was buried in the [[Winchester Cathedral|cathedral]]. It is characteristic of his kindly nature that he left his property at Shallowford for the benefit of the poor of his native town.

Walton hooked a much bigger fish than he angled for when he offered his quaint treatise, ''The Compleat Angler'', to the public. There is hardly a name in [[English literature]] whose immortality is more secure, or whose personality is the subject of a more devoted cult. Multitudes who have never put a worm on a hook&mdash;even on a fly-hook&mdash;have been caught and securely held by his picture of the delights of the gentle craft and his easy leisurely transcript of his own simple, peaceable, lovable and amusing character. ''The Compleat Angler'' was published in [[1653]], but Walton continued to add to its completeness in his leisurely way for a quarter of a century. It was dedicated to [[John Offley]], his most honoured friend. There was a second edition in [[1655]], a third in [[1661]] (identical with that of [[1664]]), a fourth in [[1668]] and a fifth in [[1676]]. In this last edition the thirteen chapters of the original have grown to twenty-one, and a second part was added by his loving friend and brother angler Charles Cotton, who took up Venator where Walton had left him and completed his instruction in fly-fishing and the making of flies.

Walton did not profess to be an expert with the fly; the [[fly fishing]] in his first edition was contributed by Thomas Barker, a retired cook and humorist, who produced a treatise of his own in [[1659]]; but in the use of the live [[worm]], the [[grasshopper]] and the [[frog]] "Piscator" himself could speak as a master. The famous passage about the frog&mdash;often misquoted about the worm

:''"use him as though you loved him, that is, harm him as little as you may possibly, that he may live the longer"''

appears in the original edition. The additions made as the work grew were not merely to the technical part; happy quotations, new turns of phrase, songs, poems and anecdotes were introduced as if the leisurely author, who wrote it as a recreation, had kept it constantly in his mind and talked it over point by point with his numerous brethren. There were originally only two interlocutors in the opening scene, "Piscator" and "Viator"; but in the second edition, as if in answer to an objection that "Piscator" had it too much in his own way in praise of angling, he introduced the falconer, "Auceps," changed "Viator" into "Venator" and made the new companions each dilate on the joys of his favourite sport.

Although ''The Compleat Angler'' was not Walton's first literary work, his leisurely labours as a biographer seem to have grown out of his devotion to angling. It was probably as an angler that he made the acquaintance of Sir [[Henry Wotton]], but it is clear that Walton had more than a love of fishing and a humorous temper to recommend him to the friendship of the accomplished ambassador. At any rate, Wotton, who had intended to write the life of John Donne, and had already corresponded with Walton on the subject, left the task to him. Walton had already contributed an [[Elegy]] to the [[1633]] edition of Donne<U+2019>s poems, and he completed and published the life, much to the satisfaction of the most learned critics, in 1640. Sir Henry Wotton dying in [[1639]], Walton undertook his life also; it was finished in [[1642]] and published in [[1651]]. His life of Hooker was published in [[1662]], that of George Herbert in [[1670]] and that of Bishop Sanderson in [[1678]]. All these subjects were endeared to the biographer by a certain gentleness of disposition and cheerful piety; three of them at least&mdash;Donne, Wotton and Herbert&mdash;were anglers. Their lives were evidently written. with loving pains, in the same leisurely fashion as his Angler, and like it are of value less as exact knowledge than as harmonious and complete pictures of character. Walton also rendered affectionate service to the memory of his friends Sir [[John Skeffington]] and [[John Chalkhill]], editing with prefatory notices Skeffington's ''Hero of Lorenzo'' in [[1652]] and Chalkhill's ''Thealma and Clearchus'' a few months before his own death in 1683. His poems and prose fragments were collected in [[1878]] under the title of ''Waltoniana''.

The best-known old edition of the Angler is J Major's (2nd ed., 1824). The book was edited by Andrew Lang in [[1896]], and various modern editions have appeared. The standard biography is that by Sir [[Harris Nicolas]], prefixed to an edition of the ''Angler'' (1836). There are notices also, with additional scraps of fact, annexed to two American editions, Bethune's (1847) and Dowling's (1857). An edition of ''Walton's Lives'', by G Sampson, appeared in [[1903]]. See also ''Izaak Walton and his Friends'', by S Martin (1903).

At least two organizations have been inspired by and named after Izaak Walton. Inspired by "The Compleat Angler," advertising mogul and land developer [[Barron Collier]] founded the Izaak Walton Fishing Club in [[1908]] at his [[Useppa Island]] resort near [[Fort Myers, Florida]]. It was considered one of the most exclusive sporting clubs in the world. The [[Izaak Walton League]] is an American association of sportsmen that was formed in [[1922]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to preserve fishing streams.

==Walton in literature==
Walton has surfaced in recent [[American literature]] with his prominence in the best selling book by [[David James Duncan]], ''[[The River Why]]'' ([[1983]]). In this semi-autobiographical novel, ''The Compleat Angler'' serves as the most revered book in the irreverent flyfisherman Gus Orviston's childhood home, his parents quoting and misquoting the treatise to obsessively argue their respective sides of the artificial [[fly lure]] versus natural bait controversy. Walton is also the protagonist of [[Howard Waldrop]]'s story ''God's Hooks!''.

Walton is also mentioned in [[Jules Verne]]'s classic ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' when the castaways decide to use snares to catch birds: "He took Herbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular apparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would have used."

[[Charles Dickens]] uses the name Izaak Walton in ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' to develop an extended metaphor comparing Jerry Cruncher's night-time "occupation" of grave robbing to fishing.

Washington Irving's humorous essay "The Angler" comments on Walton's popularity. The work is in "The Sketchbook of Geoffrey Crayon" available via Guttenberg Project.
