The '''2007<U+2013>08 Boston Celtics season''' was the 62nd season of the [[Boston Celtics]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Powered by the acquisitions of [[List of NBA All-Stars|perennial All-Stars]] [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Ray Allen]] in the offseason, the Celtics finished with a record of 66<U+2013>16 and posted the best single-season turnaround in NBA history, improving by 42&nbsp;wins from the previous season. They finished 1st in both the [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], and had the league's best record. The 66 wins were also the second-most in franchise history, behind the [[1985-86 Boston Celtics season|1985-86 Celtics]]' 67 wins.  [[Kevin Garnett]] was named [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|NBA Defensive Player of the Year]], while [[Danny Ainge]], who executed "the most dramatic NBA turnaround ever", was named [[NBA Executive of the Year Award|NBA Executive of the Year]].<ref name=execyear/> The Celtics also sold out all 41 regular-season home games.

Their two-year absence from the [[NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] came to an end as they met the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in the first round of the [[2008 NBA Playoffs]]. Eventually, they advanced to the [[2008 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] for the first time in 21 years, where they met the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. The Celtics won 4<U+2013>2, capturing their first [[List of NBA champions|championship]] since {{nbafy|1986}}, and 17th all-time. However, they had a far difficult path to this championship, playing 26 games, the most any team had ever played in a post-season.<ref name=MostGames/>

==Summary==
===NBA Draft 2007: The Ray Allen trade===
{{main|2007 NBA Draft}}
[[Image:Ray Allen baseball.jpg|thumb|200px|Shortly after being traded to the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]], [[Ray Allen]] threw out the [[Ceremonial first pitch|first pitch]] for a [[baseball]] game at [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]] of [[Major League Baseball]].]]
On May 22, the Celtics were assigned the 5th overall selection in the [[NBA Draft Lottery]], essentially losing their chance of drafting either [[Greg Oden]] or [[Kevin Durant]], who both were considered to go 1st and 2nd in the Draft. The 5th pick was the worst-case scenario for the Celtics, who had a 19.9% chance of obtaining the 1st overall selection. However, on June 28, the day of the [[2007 NBA Draft]], the Celtics traded the 5th pick along with [[Wally Szczerbiak]] and [[Delonte West]] to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in exchange for All-Star 3-point specialist [[Ray Allen]] and the 35th overall selection prior to the event, and with the 5th pick selected forward [[Jeff Green (basketball)|Jeff Green]] for Seattle.<ref> Shira Springer, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/extras/celtics_blog/2007/06/celtics_land_ra.html Celtics land Ray Allen], ''The Boston Globe''</ref> In the second round of the Draft, the Celtics selected guard [[Gabe Pruitt]] with the 32nd pick, which was their own, and forward [[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen "Big Baby" Davis]] with the 35th pick, previously obtained from Seattle.<ref> Peter May and Shira Springer, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2007/06/29/pruitt_davis_second_choices/ Pruitt, Davis second choices], ''The Boston Globe''</ref>

===Kevin Garnett trade===
[[Image:KG with a Massive Dunk.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]] achieved the league's top record with the acquisition of [[Kevin Garnett]], who carried the team throughout the season and was amongst the leaders for the [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] award.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/features/player_rankings.html Race to the MVP], ''[[NBA]].com''</ref>]]

On July 31, the Celtics traded for 10-time All-Star and 2004 MVP [[Kevin Garnett]] in the single largest trade for one player in NBA history.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2956103 ESPN - Five players, two picks sent to Wolves for Garnett - NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He was acquired from the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] in exchange for [[Al Jefferson]], [[Ryan Gomes]], [[Theo Ratliff]], [[Gerald Green]], [[Sebastian Telfair]], Boston's 2009 first-round draft pick (top three protected), the return of Minnesota's conditional first-round draft pick previously obtained in the 2006 [[Ricky Davis]]-[[Wally Szczerbiak]] trade and cash considerations.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press073107-garnett.html Celtics Acquire 10-Time All-Star Kevin Garnett | Celtics.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By adding Garnett to All-Stars [[Paul Pierce]] and [[Ray Allen]], the trade brought a new era of relevance to the long-struggling franchise, but it also left the roster short-handed.<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1014353 C<U+2019>s now a favorite topic: KG deal alters standing in East - BostonHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2007/07/31/move_is_just_the_ticket_for_once_proud_team/ Move is just the ticket for once-proud team], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', July 31, 2007.</ref>

===Free agency===
The Garnett trade left the roster depleted and depth became an immediate concern. Eventually, the Celtics signed guards [[Eddie House]] and [[Jackie Manuel]] on August 1,<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/celtics/?p=121 Celts sign Eddie House], ''Boston Herald''</ref><ref> Chris Sheridan, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2957622 Boston starts to rebuild roster, signs House to one-year deal], ''ESPN.com''</ref> just two days after the Garnett trade, and center [[Scot Pollard]] on August 9.<ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/celtics/index.php/2007/08/07/pollard-solidifies-bench/ Pollard solidifies bench], ''Boston Herald''</ref> Later, Ainge called and asked 5-time All-Star [[Reggie Miller]] to return from his 2-year retirement and join the roster in a reserve role.<ref> J.A. Adande, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2966170 Celtics call Miller, who is considering return to NBA], ''ESPN.com'', August 10, 2007</ref> Miller strongly considered the possibility of playing alongside Garnett, but ultimately announced on August 23 that he would not join the Celtics.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=adande_ja&page=Miller070824 ESPN - Miller's comeback shot snuffed by lengthy season - NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On August 27, forward [[James Posey]] signed with the team and was considered a decisive signing which instantly gave the Celtics a drastic improvement to their bench.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2991029 ESPN - Posey agrees to two-year contract with revamped Celtics - NBA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On September 26, center [[Esteban Batista]] and guard [[Dahntay Jones]] signed non-guaranteed contracts with the Celtics, two days before the beginning of training camp and the team's departure to [[Rome]] for the [[2007 NBA Europe Live Tour]].<ref> Peter May, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/extras/celtics_blog/2007/09/camp_roster_set.html Camp Roster Set], ''The Boston Globe''</ref> Curiously, Jones was involved in a trade back in the [[2003 NBA Draft]], in which the Celtics drafted him with the 20th overall selection, but immediately traded him with the 16th pick, [[Troy Bell]], to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in exchange for the 13th pick, [[Marcus Banks]], and the 27th pick, [[Kendrick Perkins]]. Ultimately, the Celtics waived Batista on October 16, and Manuel and Jones on October 25, bringing the roster down to 14&nbsp;players, one shy of the league maximum of 15&nbsp;players, in order to have roster flexibility and be able to sign another player midway through the season.<ref> Marc J. Spears, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2007/10/26/wallace_in_jones_and_manuel_out/ Wallace in, Jones and Manuel out], ''The Boston Globe''</ref>

Later in the season, on December 18, the Celtics released yet another player, [[Brandon Wallace]], in order to have even more roster flexibility that coach [[Doc Rivers]] said they needed. This move brought the roster down to only 13&nbsp;players, which is the league minimum for players allowed on a team's roster.<ref>Peter May, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2007/12/19/rookie_wallace_gets_cut_loose/ Rookie Wallace gets cut loose], ''The Boston Globe'', December 19, 2007</ref> On February 27, the Celtics signed [[Center (basketball)|center]] [[P. J. Brown|P.J. Brown]] for the remainder of the season, in order to bolster their front court.<ref>Mark Murphy, [http://bostonherald.com/sports/basketball/celtics/view.bg?articleid=1076364&srvc=celt&position=2 Celtics ink Brown], ''[[Boston Herald]]'', February 27, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press022708-pj-brown.html Celtics Sign P.J. Brown], ''Celtics.com''.</ref> His decision to come to Boston was strongly aided by a conversation with future teammates [[Ray Allen]] and [[Paul Pierce]], who convinced him to sign with the Celtics during the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game|2008]] [[NBA All-Star Weekend]].<ref>Marc J. Spears, [http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2008/02/28/brown_in_town_to_lend_depth Brown in town to lend depth], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 28, 2008.</ref> On March 4, 2008, the Celtics officially announced that they had signed [[Point guard|guard]] [[Sam Cassell]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press030408-sam-cassell.html Celtics Sign Guard Sam Cassell], ''[[Boston Celtics|Celtics]].com'', March 4, 2008.</ref> After the signing, Cassell immediately flew back to his hometown of [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] to attend funeral services for a deceased family member.<ref>Celtics Insider, [http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/celtics/?p=215&srvc=sports&position=recent Cassell here and gone], ''[[Boston Herald]]'', March 4, 2008.</ref><ref>Marc J.

Although the Celtics had the best record in the NBA with 66-16 in the regular season, their path to their first championship since {{nbafy|1986}} was far from easy. They ended up playing the most games a team had ever played in a postseason, with 26, surpassing the [[1993<U+2013>94 New York Knicks season|1994 New York Knicks]], whom Celtics coach [[Doc Rivers]] played for, and the [[2004<U+2013>05 Detroit Pistons season|2005 Detroit Pistons]], each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in {{nbafy|1994}}, Pistons in {{nbafy|2005}}). This record was set in Game 6 of the Finals.<ref name=MostGames>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E5D6113AF934A25755C0A96E9C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print|title=Celtics Remain Mindful Of a Missed Opportunity|date=June 17, 2008|first=Howard|last=Beck|newspaper=The New York Times|page=D2}}</ref>
