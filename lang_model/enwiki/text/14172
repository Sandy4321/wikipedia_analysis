'''''Joking Apart''''' is a [[BBC television]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] written by [[Steven Moffat]] about the rise and fall of a relationship. It [[Juxtaposition|juxtaposes]] a couple, Mark ([[Robert Bathurst]]) and Becky ([[Fiona Gillies]]), who meet and fall in love before getting separated and finally [[divorced]]. The series was directed by [[Bob Spiers]] and was produced by [[Andre Ptaszynski]].

The show is semi-autobiographical, being inspired by the then-recent separation of Moffat and his first wife.<ref name="ott">{{cite web|first=Graham|last=Kibble-White|title="FOOL IF YOU THINK IT'S OVER"|work=Off the Telly|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/comedy/jokingapart.htm|date=May 2006|accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> Some of the first series followed a non-linear dual structure, contrasting the rise of the relationship with the separation. Other episodes were [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] [[farce]]s, predominantly including the couple's friends Robert ([[Paul Raffield]]) and Tracy ([[Tracie Bennett]]). [[Paul Mark Elliott]] also appeared as Trevor, Becky's lover.

Although the show attracted a small audience because of scheduling problems, it attracted a small dedicated fanbase. A dedicated fan acquired the rights of the first series from the BBC and, in [[May 2006]], released it on his own DVD label.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news |first=Shane |last=Jarvis |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/05/08/bvjoke08.xml|

==Production==
===Inception===
Moffat had written two series of the [[BAFTA]]-award winning show ''[[Press Gang]]''. However, its high cost and changes in the executive structure at [[Central Independent Television|Central]] meant that the show might not be recommissioned.<ref name="big finish">Steven Moffat & [[Julia Sawalha]], "The Big Finish?" ''Press Gang: Season 2'' DVD audio commentary</ref> As the writer wondered what to do next and was worried about future employment, [[Bob Spiers]], ''Press Gang'''s primary director, suggested that he meet with producer [[Andre Ptaszynski]] to discuss writing a sitcom.<ref name="ott"/>

Moffat had been through a difficult period, with his first wife having left him. In an interview with [[Richard Herring]], Moffat says that "The sit-com actually lasted slightly longer than my marriage."<ref name="herring">{{cite web |title=Interview With Steven Moffat for the Guardian Guide |work=richardherring.com |url=http://www.richardherring.com/press/press.php?id=10|date=1997 |accessdate=2007-05-11}}</ref> He even introduced the character Brian Magboy ([[Simon Schatzberger]]) in the ''Press Gang'' episode "The Big Finish?" to represent his wife's new partner: he had all sorts of unfortunate things happen to him, such as having a [[typewriter]] dropped on his foot.<ref name="big finish"/> Having been through this experience, it was the only thing he could talk about at the meeting with Ptaszynski at the [[Groucho Club]]. His idea, then, was about "a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him."<ref name="fool">''Fool if You Think It's Over'', featurette, ''Joking Apart'', Series 1 DVD, Dir. Craig Robins</ref> It was approved by the BBC and the pilot was transmitted as part of its ''Comic Asides'' (a series of pilot shows) strand on [[12 January]] [[1991]]. The sitcom was produced by independent production company [[Pola Jones]].

===Structure===
Many of the first six episodes of ''Joking Apart'' were constructed in a multiple timeframe. The beginnings of the relationship are often juxtaposed with the separation. Moffat describes it as a "romantic comedy, but a romantic comedy backwards because it ends with the couple unhappy."<ref name="fool"/>

====Stand-up sequences====
[[Image:Joking Apart - Robert Bathurst.jpg|thumb|Mark, in a fantasy stand-up sequence. According to Moffat, Bathurst was filmed against a completely black backdrop in the pilot. According to Moffat, this looked "odd" for the viewer.<ref name="fool"/>]]
All of the episodes opened with Mark using his relationship as material for [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] performances in a small [[comedy club]]. Bathurst expected that they would be reshot, but, to save money, they were not. 

Episodes regularly cut back to Mark's performances, designed as [[fantasy]] sequences. The opening line was usually "My wife left me..." Moffat felt audiences needed to know from the start that the relationship would not survive.<ref name="fool"/> However, it was unclear to some that the sequences were designed as an indication of Mark's internal creative process (to show that "he thinks in punchlines, in comedy"), rather than actual performances.<ref name="gritten">{{cite news |first=David |last=Gritten |title=unknown |work=Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/pre_and_re/11.htm |format=reprint on unofficial website |date=8 January 1993 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> 

Like ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which used a similar device, ''Joking Apart'' would use less of the stand-up as the series progressed. In retrospect, Moffat regrets including the stand-up sequences,<ref name="fool"/> although Bathurst has had the idea of refilming them as a [[video diary]] now that he is older to show him reflecting on his earlier life.<ref name="conbath2">{{cite web |title=In Conversation: Robert Bathurst, Part 2 |work=Joking Apart.com |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/in_conversation/robert_bathurst_p2.htm |accessdate=2007-03-03}}</ref>

Other than the stand-up sequences, the second series followed a more linear structure. Moffat had experimented with [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]] narrative in ''Press Gang'', notably the episode "[[Monday-Tuesday]]". ''[[Coupling (TV series)|Coupling]]'' would later use similar devices throughout the series.

===Casting and location===
[[Robert Bathurst]], a former [[Footlights]] president, was cast as Mark Taylor. He was performing on a live topical programme on [[British Satellite Broadcasting|BSB]] called ''Up the News''. A fellow performer on that show also auditioned for the part at what is now the [[Soho Theatre]], the old Soho Synagogue in [[Dean Street]], and claimed that he would break Bathurst's legs if he got the job. In a 2005 interview, Bathurst recalls that the threat seemed not to be "entirely jocular".<ref>{{cite web |title=In Conversation: Robert Bathurst, Part 1 |work=Joking Apart.com |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/in_conversation/robert_bathurst_p1.htm |accessdate=2007-03-01}}</ref>

[[Fiona Gillies]] was cast as Becky Johnson/Taylor. It was her first major television role, having appeared in ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' as Beryl Stapleton, and the mini-series ''Mother Love''. She was aware that some of her dialogue was based on what had been said to Moffat during the separation.<ref name="fool"/>

The exterior shots were mainly filmed in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] within a short distance from the director's home.<ref name="conmoff4">{{cite web |title=In Conversation: Steven Moffat, Part 4 |work=jokingapart.co.uk |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/in_conversation/steven_moffat_p4.htm |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Mark's flat, just off the [[Kings Road]], was used by actor [[Tom Baker]] when he was living with [[Lalla Ward]] while he was filming ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref>Steven Moffat, episode 1 audio commentary, ''Joking Apart'' Series 1 DVD</ref>

==Characters==
'''Mark Taylor''' ([[Robert Bathurst]]) is a television sitcom writer. Other than episode one, where he is shown working on a script, and a show of his had been aired the night before a dinner with Robert and Tracy, his work is hardly mentioned.
[[Image:Joking apart - mark and becky.jpg|thumb|Becky and Mark discuss their marriage in episode one]]
Mark is quick witted. However, this proves to be the downfall of his marriage with Becky, who says that she didn't sign on to become his "lawfully wedded [[comic foil|straight man]]." Becky articulates her frustration in response to Mark's joke about worrying that his virginity will heal back by responding "What page is that on?" Identifying his insecurities, she points out that the "thing about someone who uses humour as a weapon, is not the sense of humour, but the fact that they need a weapon."<ref name="ep1">{{cite episode |title = Episode 1 |series=Joking Apart |credits= wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=BBC 2 | airdate=1993-01-07 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref>

Moffat would use the surname 'Taylor' for [[Jack Davenport]]'s character Steve (named after the writer) in ''Coupling'' to suggest a thematic link between the two shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.net/forum/showpost.php?p=76193&postcount=67|title="Coupling Season 4" (requires free registation to view) |first=Steven|last=Moffat|authorlink=Steven Moffat |publisher=[[Outpost Gallifrey]] |date=[[2004-06-08]] |accessdate=2006-11-12}}</ref>

'''Becky Johnson/Taylor''' ([[Fiona Gillies]]) meets Mark at a funeral, and they eventually marry. Although irritated at being his comic foil, she is capable of her own quick-witted put-downs. In episode 3, for example, she 'wins' an impromptu one-liner contest over Mark, whose put-downs fall flat.<ref name="ep3">{{cite episode |title=Episode 3 |series=Joking Apart |credits= wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=BBC 2 | airdate=1993-01-21 |season=1 |number=3}}</ref>

Becky is shown as an independent woman, meeting Mark on her terms.<ref name="eps2e3">{{cite episode |title = Episode 3 |series=Joking Apart |credits= wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=BBC 2 | airdate=1995-01-17 |season=2 |number=3}}</ref> The first series revolves around her leaving Mark for [[estate agent]] Trevor, on whom she cheats in series two.

[[Image:Joking Apart - Robert and Tracy.jpg|thumb|200px|Tracy and Robert after listening in to a conversation, in series 1 episode 4.]]
'''Robert''' and '''Tracy Glazebrook''' ([[Paul Raffield]] and [[Tracie Bennett]]) are their "increasingly bizarre and totally dim friends."<ref>{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Evans |title=The Guinness Television Encyclopedia |publisher=Guinness|year=1995 |pages =284 |isbn= 0851127444}}</ref> They are initially Becky's friends, but they become friends with Mark too, comforting him on the night Becky leaves him.<ref name="ep2">{{cite episode |title=Episode 2 |series=Joking Apart |credits= wr.

Tracy is, as Tracie Bennett identifies, is a stereotypical [[Tracy]], which is normally a [[dysphemism]] for an intellectually inadequate (usually [[blonde]]) female. However, "she's not a [[bimbo]]: she's quite clever in her own logic."<ref name="fool"/>

They are both naive about sex and technology. Tracy, for example, attempts to telephone Robert to inform him that he's lost his [[mobile phone]],<ref name="ep5">{{cite episode |title=Episode 5 |series=Joking Apart |credits= wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=BBC 2 |airdate=1993-02-05 |season=1 |number=5}}</ref> and believes that she is a [[lesbian]] when she discovers her husband in [[Cross-dressing|woman's clothing]].<ref name="ep2-4">{{cite episode |title=Episode 4 |series=Joking Apart |credits= wr. Steven Moffat, dir. Bob Spiers |network=BBC 2 |airdate=1993-02-24 |season=2 |number=5}}</ref>

They have a baby, which is seen or referred to occasionally, reflecting, as Moffat observes, that it was written before he himself had children.<ref>Steven Moffat, episode 3 audio commentary, ''Joking Apart'' Series 1 DVD</ref>

'''Trevor''' ([[Paul-Mark Elliott]]) is Becky's lover, but is himself cheated on in the second series, as Becky dates her solicitor Michael (Tony Gardner). His debut appearance is in the third episode where he and Becky go to Robert and Tracy's house for dinner. He features less regularly than the main ensemble.

{{main|List of Joking Apart episodes}}
===Pilot===

The series started as a pilot, broadcast in the ''Comic Asides'' (a series of pilot shows) strand on [[12 July]] [[1991]].  It was directed by [[John Kilby]], and filmed at [[Pebble Mill Studios|Pebble Mill]] in [[Birmingham]] on [[9 August]] [[1990]].<ref>{{cite web |title=JOKING APART: BBC Programme Number: LLCB843S |work=BBC EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE database |url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LLCB843S |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> It is practically identical to the first episode of the series proper: some scenes are even reused, notably the scene with Mark and Becky meet when he accidentally turns up at a funeral (hence episode one's shared director credit between Spiers and Kilby).<ref>{{cite web |title=COMPARING THE PILOT AND EPISODE ONE |work=jokingapart.co.uk|url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/pilot_vs_episode_one.htm |accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref>

The stand-up sequences were shot against a black background. Although this made it clearer that they were not 'real', it looked odd.<ref name="fool"/>

===Series one===

The first series of six episodes were recorded at [[BBC Television Centre]] in April/May 1992, and transmission began on [[7 January]] [[1993]].

The first episode showed the couple meeting at a funeral, marrying, going through the [[honeymoon]] phase, and in programme 2, Becky admitted she was an [[adulteress]]. Although she inadvertently admitted this fact before realising that all of her friends were hiding around her [[living room]] before the surprise party was started. This episode was basically a re-recorded version of the pilot, with a revised set design.

===Series two===

The second series was filmed in late 1993. However, the controller of BBC 2, [[Michael Jackson (TV)|Michael Jackson]], had little faith in the project (Jackson now admits that he was wrong). He felt that it was too [[mainstream]] for BBC 2 for not mainstream enough for BBC 1.<ref name="moffat3">{{cite web |title=In Conversation: Steven Moffat, Part 3 |work=jokingapart.co.uk |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/in_conversation/steven_moffat_p3.htm |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> Bathurst articulates the group's frustration at the delay:

<blockquote>Every so often, I<U+2019>d get a call from the producer saying, it<U+2019>s going out at this time. The publicity people would be alerted, then we<U+2019>d get a call saying no, it<U+2019>s not, it<U+2019>s been put back. That happened six times, I think, altogether <U+2013> seven reschedules in a year or so...  It was extraordinary and inexplicable, and just one of these things that happen. I mean, a lot of shows are left on people<U+2019>s desks and they hardly get seen, and ''Joking Apart'' was certainly one of those. Meanwhile, they were making about four series of ''[[The Brittas Empire]]'', and you thought, <U+201C>Bloody Hell! Come on, surely<U+2026>.?<U+201D> To my mind, our show was a very superior product, and it upset me that other shows, which I, personally, felt were broader and less interesting, were getting precedence.<ref name="conbath2"/></blockquote>

In this series, Becky was cheating on Trevor with her solicitor, Michael. Mark fantasizes about killing Trevor, exposes himself to his elderly Aunt and meets his [[penis]] ([[Kerry Shale]]). The dual timelines were largely dropped for the second series. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point going back to the start.<ref name="moffat3"/>

After being postponed from the autumn 1994 schedules, even though the show had won an award at [[Rose d'Or|Montreux]], the six episodes of the second series begun transmission on [[3 January]] [[1995]]. After winning the Montreux award it seemed inevitable that the show would get a third series. However, it was never recommissioned. Moffat says that he had no idea for a third series anyway, as it would have been difficult to contrive how a group of people who did not particularly like each other would get together so regularly.<ref name="conmoff4"/>

==Music and titles==
"Fool if You Think It's Over", written by [[Chris Rea]], was used over both the opening and closing credit sequences. It was performed by [[Kenny Craddock]], who had himself gone through a divorce in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |first=Colin |last=Gibson |title=Kenny Craddock |url=http://www.kennycraddock.com/ |accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> Craddock and Colin Gibson arranged the [[incidental music]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Composers: Kenny Craddock |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/composers.htm |accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> Whereas only the chorus of the theme song accompanied the opening titles, the closing credits had a verse and chorus. The first part of the closing credits was over a still of the final [[Film frame|frame]], and fading to black with the line "All dressed in black."

The opening titles were a series of images of famous separated couples, over legal imagery, including [[Arthur Miller]] & [[Marilyn Monroe]]; [[Winnie Mandela|Winnie]] & [[Nelson Mandela]]; [[Princess Anne]] & [[Mark Phillips]]; culminating in Mark & Becky.

==Reception==
The scheduling problems meant that the show did not get the momentum to achieve high viewing figures.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joking Apart |title=British Sitcom Guide |url=http://www.sitcom.co.uk/joking_apart/ |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Moffat jokes that "the eight people who saw it were very happy indeed."<ref>''Coupling: Behind the Scenes'', featurette (2002, prod./dir. Sarah Barnett & Christine Wilson) ''Couping'' Season 1 DVD (Region 1), BBC Video, ISBN 0790773392</ref> However, as Bathurst observes, "there's an underground of people who like it."<ref name="men">{{cite web |first=Ian |last=Wylie |title=Robert's fatherly fear |work=Manchester Evening News |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/145/145103_roberts_fatherly_fear.html |date=4 Feb 2005 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> The show rated highly on the Appreciation Index (AI), meaning that viewers thought very highly of the programme.<ref name="telegraph"/> Bathurst says that drunks on the [[London Underground]] tell him in detail the plot of their favourite episode.

The cast claim that the programme has a timeless, universal appeal.<ref name="fool"/> Excluding some of the technology, specifically the typewriter and the size of the mobile telephones, there are no time-specific references. Gillies says that her accountant puts it on to cheer him up. Bathurst says that a friend of his cheered so loudly when Mark pushes [[avocado]] into Trevor's face<ref name="ep3"/> that he woke his son.<ref name="fool"/>

Critical reception was generally positive. The ''[[Daily Express]]'' said that it was "flavoured with a delicious bitterness about the perfidy of women and the conscious-less nature of the male orgasm, it was plotted with the intricacy of a French farce."<ref>{{cite news|first=Margaret |last=Forwood |title=unknown title |work=Daily Express |format=Cutting on unofficial website |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/pre_and_re/16.htm |date=13 February 1993 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Another reviewer for the ''Express'' commented that "it's quite funny and an acute analysis" of the modern divorce. The first episode is labelled "distinctly promising."<ref>{{cite news|first=Maureen |last=Paton |title=unknown title |work=Daily Express |format=Cutting on unofficial website |url=http://www.jokingapart.co.uk/pre_and_re/11.htm |date=8 January 1993 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> Criticising Bathurst for being too handsome to convey the frustrations of a writer, the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said that the show had "its problems but possesses a dark, mordant wit."<ref name="gritten"/>

In his overview of Moffat's celebrated ''Press Gang'', [[Paul Cornell]] says that the writer "continues to impress" with ''Joking Apart''.<ref>[[Paul Cornell]] (1993) "Press Gang" In: {{cite book |last= Cornell |first= Paul. |coauthors= [[Martin Day]], [[Keith Topping]] |title= The Guinness Book of Classic British TV |publisher=Guinness |year= 1993 |pages=218|id= ISBN 0-85112-543-3}}</ref> While the transmission of series two was still being delayed by BBC 2 controller [[Michael Jackson (TV)|Michael Jackson]], the show won the [[Rose d'Or|Bronze Rose of Montreux]]<ref name="ott"/> and was entered for the [[Emmys]].<ref name="telegraph"/>

The show was remade in [[Portugal]]. Moffat reflects that although the remake is "not as dark or ground-breaking" than the original, it is "probably more fun" because it ends happily.<ref name="herring"/> The remake used a linear structure rather than the flashbacks.

==DVD release==
The first series was released on [[DVD]] on [[29 May]] [[2006]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Replay DVD |url=http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/ |accessdate=2007-03-03}}</ref> It contains [[audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentaries]] on four of the episodes from Moffat, Bathurst, Gillies and Bennett. It also contains a [[featurette]], "Fool If You Think It's Over", with retrospective interviews.
