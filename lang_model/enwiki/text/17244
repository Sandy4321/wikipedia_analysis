'''''Oryzomys dimidiatus''''', also known as the '''Nicaraguan Oryzomys''',<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1148</ref> '''Thomas's Rice Rat''',<ref name=iucn/> or '''Nicaraguan Rice Rat''',<ref>Duff and Lawson, 2004, p.&nbsp;54; Jones and Engstrom, 1986, p.&nbsp;12</ref> is a [[rodent]] in the genus ''[[Oryzomys]]'' of the family [[Cricetidae]]. It is known from only three specimens, all collected in southeastern Nicaragua since 1904. Placed in ''[[Nectomys]]'' upon its discovery, it was later classified in its own [[subgenus]] of ''[[Oryzomys]]'' and finally recognized as closely related to other species now placed in ''Oryzomys'', including the [[marsh rice rat]] and ''[[Oryzomys couesi]]'', which occurs in the same region.

With a head and body length of 110 to 128&nbsp;mm (4.3 to 5.0&nbsp;in), ''Oryzomys dimidiatus'' is a medium-sized [[Oryzomyini|rice rat]]. The upperparts are gray-brown and the underparts are grayish, not [[wikt:buff|buffy]] as in ''O.&nbsp;couesi''. The tail is only slightly darker above than below. All three specimens were caught near water and the species may be [[semiaquatic]], spending some time in the water. Its [[conservation status]] is currently assessed as "[[Least Concern]]".

==Taxonomy==
The first known specimen was obtained by W.G. Palmer in 1904<ref name=T587>Thomas, 1905, p.&nbsp;587</ref> and the next year, [[Oldfield Thomas]] of the [[British Museum of Natural History]] described this animal as the [[holotype]] of a new [[species]] he named ''Nectomys dimidiatus''.<ref name=T586/> He placed it in the genus ''[[Nectomys]]'', commenting that it was much smaller than but otherwise similar to previously known members of that genus.<ref name=T586/> The species was listed as a ''Nectomys'' in [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] overviews in the next decades, including a 1944 review of the genus by [[Philip Hershkovitz]].<ref name=H80>Hershkovitz, 1944, p.&nbsp;80</ref>

After examining the holotype in London, Hershkovitz instead placed the species in the genus ''[[Oryzomys]]'' in 1948. He remarked that it was an especially distinctive member of that genus, and hence classified it in its own [[subgenus]] ''Micronectomys''.<ref name=H54-55>Hershkovitz, 1948, pp.&nbsp;54<U+2013>55</ref> J. Hern<U+00E1>ndez-Camacho described a second species of ''Micronectomys'', ''Oryzomys (Micronectomys) borreroi'', from Colombia in 1957.<ref name=H792>Hershkovitz, 1970, p.&nbsp;792</ref> In 1970, Hershkovitz treated ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'' in another publication and conceded that his name ''Micronectomys'' was a ''[[nomen nudum]]'' ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication.<ref name=H791>Hershkovitz, 1970, p.&nbsp;791</ref> Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and ''Micronectomys'' remains a ''nomen nudum''.<ref name=MC1144>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&nbsp;1144</ref> Hershkovitz also noted that while ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'' resembles a juvenile ''Nectomys'' in external anatomy, it is otherwise similar to the [[marsh rice rat]] (''Oryzomys palustris'').<ref name=H791/> He accepted ''O.&nbsp;borreroi'' as an ''Oryzomys'', but did not think it closely related to ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus''.<ref name=H792/> Six years later, [[Alfred Gardner]] and [[James L. Patton|James Patton]] instead suggested that ''O.&nbsp;borreroi'' was a ''[[Zygodontomys]]'', and in his 1991 review of that genus Robert Voss confirmed that it is the same as ''[[Zygodontomys brunneus]]''.<ref name=V46>Voss, 1991, p.&nbsp;46</ref>

A second specimen was obtained in 1966 and the find was published in 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who noted that the species is closely similar to ''O.&nbsp;palustris''.<ref name=GJ433>Genoways and Jones, 1971, p.&nbsp;433</ref> Later workers affirmed the relationship between ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'', ''O.&nbsp;palustris'' and associated species like ''[[Oryzomys couesi|O.&nbsp;couesi]]''.<ref name=Weat1/> Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found.<ref name=R204>Reid, 1997, p.&nbsp;204</ref> In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in ''Oryzomys'' from the genus, because they are not closely related to the [[type species]] ''O.&nbsp;palustris'', but kept ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'' as an ''Oryzomys''.<ref name=Weat1>Weksler et al., 2006, table&nbsp;1, footnote&nbsp;e</ref>

''Oryzomys dimidiatus'' is now recognized as one of eight species in the genus ''Oryzomys''.<ref name=CAC116>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;116</ref> ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'' is further part of the ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' section, which is centered around the widespread Central American ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions.<ref name=CAC117>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;117</ref> ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' occurs with ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus'' in southeastern Nicaragua.<ref name=JE12>Jones and Engstrom, 1986, p.&nbsp;12</ref> Many aspects of the [[systematics]] of the ''O.&nbsp;couesi'' section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group.<ref name=CAC107>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;107</ref> ''Oryzomys'' is classified in the tribe [[Oryzomyini]] ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species,<ref name=W3>Weksler, 2006, p.&nbsp;3</ref> and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily [[Sigmodontinae]] of family [[Cricetidae]], along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.<ref name=MC05>Musser and Carleton, 2005</ref>

==Description==
[[File:Oryzomys palustris in vegetation.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A rat, grayish above and pale below, among reed and leaf litter.|The [[marsh rice rat]] (''Oryzomys palustris'') is similar to ''O.&nbsp;dimidiatus''.<ref name=GJ433/>]]
''Oryzomys dimidiatus'' is a medium-sized rice rat, smaller than ''O.&nbsp;couesi'', with thick, glossy fur and velvety underfur. The hairs on the back are about 6&nbsp;mm in length. The upperparts are gray-brown with some dark hairs, appearing darker overall than in ''O.&nbsp;couesi'';  the color becomes more yellowish towards the sides. According to Thomas, a faint [[wikt:buff|buff]] line extends from the sides to the inner sides of the hindlegs. The underparts are grayish, contrasting with the buffy underparts of ''O.&nbsp;couesi''. The snout is short and the well-haired ears are partly hidden by the fur. The hands and feet are off-white or brownish above, not white as in ''O.&nbsp;couesi''. The hindfeet show small [[interdigital webbing|interdigital webs]], but they lack long [[ungual tuft|tufts of hair]] on the digits and some of the [[paw#Common characteristics|pads]] are reduced or absent. [[Natatory fringe|Fringes of hair]] are present along the [[plantar]] margins and between some of the digits. The tail is about as long as the head and body and contains about 15 rings per centimeter. It is slightly darker (grayish) above than below (whitish), but the difference in color is much less pronounced than in ''O.&nbsp;couesi''.<ref>Thomas, 1905, p.&nbsp;586; Genoways and Jones, 1971, p.&nbsp;833; S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, pp.&nbsp;209<U+2013>210; Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;207</ref>

Compared to that of ''Nectomys'', the skull is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a broad, round [[braincase]] without conspicuous ridges on it. The [[zygomatic plate]] is broad. The [[incisive foramen|incisive foramina]] (perforations of the front part of the [[palate]]) extend between the first [[molar (tooth)|molars]] and are broadest in their back halves. The broad [[mesopterygoid fossa]], the gap behind the end of the palate, is perforated by [[sphenopalatine vacuities]]. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in ''Nectomys'' species, but the front cusps of the upper ([[anterocone]]) and lower first molar ([[anteroconid]]) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.<ref>Hershkovitz, 1948, p.&nbsp;55; S<U+00E1>nchez et al., 2001, pp.&nbsp;209<U+2013>210</ref>

Measurements for the first two known examples are as follows (in each case, the first measurement given is from the [[holotype]], taken in 1904, the second, from the specimen taken in 1966): head and body length 125 and 118&nbsp;mm (4.9 and 4.6&nbsp;in), tail length 115 and 110&nbsp;mm (4.5 and 4.3&nbsp;in), hindfoot length 27 and 28&nbsp;mm (1.1 and 1.1&nbsp;in), ear length 13 and 15&nbsp;mm (0.51 and 0.59&nbsp;in), skull length 29.8 and 29.0&nbsp;mm (1.17 and 1.14&nbsp;in). The 1966 specimen weighed 46.0&nbsp;g (1.62&nbsp;oz) and had testes 11&nbsp;mm (0.43&nbsp;in) long; these measurements were not recorded in the 1904 specimen.<ref name=JE13>Jones and Engstrom, 1986, p.&nbsp;13</ref> Reid, who mentioned the third specimen, reported a maximum head and body length of 128&nbsp;mm (5.0&nbsp;in), tail length of 150&nbsp;mm (5.9&nbsp;in), hindfoot length of 31&nbsp;mm (1.2&nbsp;in), and ear length of 19&nbsp;mm (0.75&nbsp;in).<ref name=R207>Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;207</ref>

==Distribution, ecology, and behavior==
''Oryzomys dimidiatus'' is known from three specimens collected in the lowlands of the [[Regi<U+00F3>n Aut<U+00F3>noma del Atl<U+00E1>ntico Sur]] in southeastern Nicaragua.<ref>Timm and Reid, 2008; Reid, 2009, p.&nbsp;207</ref> The first, an old male, was collected on November&nbsp;5, 1904, in a banana plantation with very moist red clay on the [[R<U+00ED>o Escondido (Nicaragua)|R<U+00ED>o Escondido]] near [[El Rama]].<ref name=T587/> The second, a young adult male, was caught on July&nbsp;26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the [[R<U+00ED>o Mico]] at [[El Recreo]], 15&nbsp;km (9&nbsp;mi) west from the location of the first specimen, along with three other rice rats (''O.&nbsp;couesi'', ''[[Melanomys caliginosus]]'', and ''[[Oligoryzomys fulvescens]]''), the cotton rat ''[[Sigmodon hirsutus]]'', and the cottontail rabbit ''[[Sylvilagus brasiliensis]]''.<ref>Genoways and Jones, 1971, p.&nbsp;833; Musser and Carleton, 2005, pp.&nbsp;1125, 1141, 1147, 1175</ref> The third was caught at a stream near [[Bluefields]]. Reid suggested that the species is [[semiaquatic]], spending some time in the water,<ref name=R207/> like other ''Oryzomys''.<ref name=CAC114>Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, 2009, p.&nbsp;114</ref>

==Conservation status==
The 2009 [[IUCN Red List]] assessed the conservation status of ''Oryzomys dimidiatus'' as "[[Least Concern]]", noting that its distribution may be larger than currently known. Its population is presumed to be large and no threats to its habitat are known.<ref name=iucn/>
