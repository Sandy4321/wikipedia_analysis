"'''Jack-Tor'''" is the [[List of 30 Rock episodes|fifth episode]] of the [[30 Rock (season 1)|first season]] of the [[United States|American]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[30 Rock]]'', which aired on [[November 16]], [[2006 in television|2006]] on the [[NBC]] network in the [[United States]],<ref name="washingpage1"/> and on [[November 8]], [[2007]] in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="ukairing">{{cite news |first=Gareth |last=McLean |title=Watch This|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2007/nov/08/1|publisher=''[[Media Guardian]]'' |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref> The episode was written by [[Robert Carlock]] and was directed by [[Don Scardino]].<ref name="varietytor">{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/profiles/Episode/main/171713/60407/Jack-Tor.html?dataSet=1|title=''30 Rock''&nbsp;<U+2013> Jack-Tor&nbsp;<U+2013> Synopsis, Credits, Companies&nbsp;<U+2013> Variety Profiles|accessdate=2008-08-12 |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''}}</ref> Guest stars in this episode include [[Katrina Bowden]], [[Lonny Ross]], [[Keith Powell]], [[Maulik Pancholy]], [[Teddy Coluca]], [[James Murtaugh]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Doug Moe]], Joey La Varco and [[Matthew Stocke]].

The episode focuses on [[Jack Donaghy]]'s ([[Alec Baldwin]]) pressure on the writers of ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' to integrate General Electric products into the show, which forces [[Liz Lemon]] ([[Tina Fey]]) to integrate Jack himself into a self-referential sketch about product placement. [[Frank Rossitano]] ([[Judah Friedlander]]) and [[James "Toofer" Spurlock]] ([[Keith Powell]]) trick [[Jenna Maroney]] ([[Jane Krakowski]]) into thinking that her job is in danger, and Liz wonders if [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) might be illiterate when he refuses to read cue cards.

==Plot==
Jack tells Liz and the writers of ''TGS Tracy Jordan'' that he wants them to insert [[General Electric]] (GE) products into the show. The writers express their reluctance in doing [[product placement]]s for GE (even though during the scene the cast talk about how great [[Snapple]]'s White Green Tea tastes), but Liz agrees on the condition that Jack appears in the sketch. The next day, Liz watches a video containing outtakes from Jack's product placement video, where she discovers that he repeatedly forgot his lines after 142 takes. After realizing that he needs help, Liz encourages Jack to go through with the sketch, which he ultimately is able to shoot.  

Tracy decides that he is going to take a break from rehearsals after he is called back on stage to read his cue cards. When Tracy appears to be ignoring his cue cards, Jenna informs Liz of the situation, and realizes that Tracy might be illiterate, citing an earlier [[The Aftermath (30 Rock)|promo cue card mishap]] as an example. Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits that he is illiterate and agrees to get help. As he leaves to go to the elevator, Liz sees him reading a newspaper, and later learns that Tracy was using this ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is not going to take it anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch.

Jenna tells Liz that she wishes to insert a music number called "Muffin Top" into the show, which she claims is a big hit overseas. While rehearsing, Jenna is pranked by Frank and Toofer, who tell her that several people are going to be fired. Believing them, Jenna tries to use her sexuality to seduce a NBC executive, who she sees talking to Jack. Liz later notifies Jenna that no one is going to be fired, and that the executive is actually an extra on the show. Jenna aims to get back at the pair, and although Toofer admits that he was too smart for Jenna's tactics, Frank is seen running around naked outside Jack's balcony. Jenna finally gets her chance to perform "Muffin Top", unaware that the show has already ended and the number was scratched at the last moment, thanks to Liz.

In an effort to improve ratings, "Jack-Tor" was the first episode of ''30 Rock'' to air on a Thursday night, which is advertised by NBC as "[[Must-See TV#Decline|Comedy Night Done Right]]".<ref name="cndr">{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Hein |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Is Comedy Night Being Done Right? |url=http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Hein-Sight/Comedy-Night-Right/800038049 |work= |publisher=''[[TV Guide]]'' |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2008-07-30 }}</ref> ''30 Rock'' was also one of several sitcoms to have a "super-sized" episode, which NBC employed as a sweeps stunt, and to initiate a mostly comedy lineup. Instead of the usual 30-minute episodes, "Jack-Tor" was increased to 40 minutes.<ref name="washingpage1">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501577.html |title=''30 Rock'', Solid Enough to Rebuild a Thursday Foundation |accessdate=2008-08-12 |author=Shales, Tom |date=2006-11-16 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}</ref> Despite the increased length of the episode, [[Jack McBrayer]], who plays [[Kenneth Parcell]], received credits but did not appear. Fey said that there was "such a big ensemble" in the episode that he was crowded out.<ref name="washingpage1"/> Fey said that she thought "McBrayer is fantastic", and that she is "planning to use him lots and lots". Executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] also praised McBrayer, saying "we're very high on him. He's obviously the breakout performer on the series. We like him, the network likes him, viewers like him, everybody likes him."<ref name="washingpage2"/>

''[[Star Wars]]'' is frequently referenced in ''30 Rock'', beginning with the [[Pilot (30 Rock)|pilot episode]] where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a [[Jedi]].<ref name="plotreference">{{cite episode |title=Pilot |episodelink=Pilot (30 Rock) |series=30 Rock |credits=Writer(s): [[Tina Fey]]; Director: [[Adam Bernstein]] |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2006-10-11 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref> Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of ''Star Wars'', saying that she had watched it many times with [[Pete Hornberger]],<ref name="fireworks">{{cite episode |title=Fireworks |episodelink= |series=30 Rock |credits=Writers : Dave Finkel, Brett Baer; Director: Beth McCarthy |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2007-04-05 |season=1 |number=18}}</ref> and saying she dressed up as the ''Star Wars'' character [[Princess Leia Organa|Princess Leia]] during four Halloweens.<ref name="souce">{{cite episode |title=The Source Awards |episodelink= |series=30 Rock |credits=Writer(s): Robert Carlock, [[Daisy Gardner]]; Director: Don Scardino |network=[[NBC Universal]] |station=[[NBC]] |airdate=2007-03-01 |season=1 |number=16}}</ref> Fey, a fan of ''Star Wars'' herself, said that the weekly ''Star Wars'' joke or reference "started happening organically" when the crew realized that they had a ''Star Wars'' reference "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on "it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to [[Robert Carlock]], who she described as "the resident expert".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/articles/filmtv/04648653/tina_fey_gets_the_gold.html |title=Tina Fey Gets the Gold |accessdate=2008-07-07 |author=Topel, Fred |date=2007-09-16 |publisher=Crave Online}}</ref> In this episode, ''Star Wars'' is referenced when Frank mentions a "friend in accounting" named [[Lando Calrissian]], a prominent ''Star Wars'' character.<ref name="torguide">{{cite web |url=http://community.tvguide.com/blog/TV-Show-Blog/30-Rock/700010012?month=200611 |title=November 16, 2006: "You're Such a Monica!" |accessdate=2008-08-15 |author=Webb Mitovich, Matt |date=2006-11-16|publisher=''[[TV Guide]]''}}</ref>

==Reception==
{{Quote_box |width=42% |align=right|quote="Regardless of problems, ''30 Rock'' has earned its spot on the schedule, and not just because comedies are in such woefully short supply&nbsp;<U+2013> although, come to think of it, that might be reason enough right there. ''30 Rock'' is as good as ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'' and the rapidly aging ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. All four shows lined up in a row do not compare with NBC's greatest Thursday nights, but network executives deserve at least a peep of gratitude for keeping the freshmen on the air while smart people tinker with the entrails and make the shows better."|source= <U+2014> [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on ''30 Rock''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s timeslot change.<ref name="washingpage2">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501577_2.html|title=''30 Rock'', Solid Enough to Rebuild a Thursday Foundation (page 2) |accessdate=2008-08-12 |author=Shales, Tom |date=2006-11-16 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}</ref>}}
"Jack-Tor" brought in an average of 5.2&nbsp;million American viewers upon its original broadcast in the United States, achieving a 2.4/6 in the key 18<U+2013>49 year old demographic. The 2.4 refers to 2.4% of all people of ages 18<U+2013>49 years old, and the 6 refers to 6% of all people of ages 18<U+2013>49 years old watching television at the time of the broadcast.<ref name="ratings_1">{{cite press release |title=NBC'S Primetime Lineup Finished Week Nine with a 12 Percent Jump Versus its 18-49 Rating for the Same Week Last Year |publisher=''[[NBC Universal]] Media Village'' |date=2006-11-21 |url=http://www.nbcumv.com/entertainment/release_detail.nbc/entertainment-20061121000000-nbc039sprimetime.html |accessdate=2008-08-16}}</ref> ''30 Rock''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s timeslot change, from Wednesday to Thursday, which was aimed at improving ratings,<ref name="washingpage1"/> was a success compared to the previous episode, "[[Jack the Writer]]"; it was watched by approximately 4.61&nbsp;million American viewers,<ref>''[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Medianet'', ([[November 7]], [[2006]]) "[http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=110706_05 Weekly Program Rankings]".

Joal Ryan of [[E!]] reported that the "sparse crowd" of 5.2&nbsp;million viewers was a large decrease from the ratings ''30 Rock'' achieved on Wednesdays, where it averaged 6.3&nbsp;million viewers per episode.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://au.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=9fd5e703-5bef-4076-be73-4a92fc83f913 |title=''30 Rock'' Goes Thud on Thursday |accessdate=2008-08-15 |author=Ryan, Joal |publisher=[[E!]]}}</ref> 

Matt Webb Mitovich of ''[[TV Guide]]'' said that while the storyline of Liz being forced to integrate GE products into the show was a "good idea", it "missed the bull's-eye". He also felt that the storyline of putting Jack on ''TGS with Tracy Jordan'' was "fun", but thought "that for some reason fell a bit flat".<ref name="torguide"/> [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt that "''30 Rock'' had "consistently and considerably improved since its premiere". He praised Alec Baldwin, whose performance he described as "rare and rich [...] perilously close to perfect, beyond improving". Shales said that it was "painful to report" that Jack McBrayer was absent in the episode, saying he was "the show's brightest discovery", and his "performance has been a bittersweet beauty".<ref name="washingpage1"/> Rob Canning of [[IGN]] said that ''30 Rock''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s was "one new comedy we do not want to see taken off the air". He said that "Jack-Tor" had him "laughing from every angle", and may have "begun a debate as to which character is more fun to watch&nbsp;<U+2013> Jack Donaghy or Tracy Jordan?". He said that the outtakes of Jack's sketch were "one of the best parts of the episode", and that Tracy was evolving into his own "uniquely hilarious character". Overall, he felt that Jack was winning the "comedy showdown".<ref name="torign">{{cite news |url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/746/746564p1.html |title=30 Rock: "Jack-Tor" Review |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Canning |first=Robert |date=2006-11-17 |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref>
