The history of skyscrapers in Albuquerque began with the construction of the [[First National Bank Building (Albuquerque)|First National Bank Building]] in 1922, which is often regarded as the first skyscraper in New Mexico.<ref name="CONDO">{{cite web|url=http://albuquerque.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2007/08/20/story2.html|title=Sky-high living|accessdate=2008-03-10|publisher=New Mexico Business Weekly|last=O'Connell|first=Tom}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albuquerque300.org/index.aspx?pk=221&temp=2|title=History: New Deal Economy|accessdate=2008-03-10|publisher=Albuquerque Tricentennial}}</ref> The building, a [[National Register of Historic Places|Registered Historic Place]], is now a residential tower known officially as "The Bank Lofts".<ref name="CONDO"/> Albuquerque went through a large building boom that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, during which time 20 of the city's 26 tallest buildings were constructed, including the Albuquerque Plaza complex. Most of Albuquerque's tall buildings are located in either [[Downtown Albuquerque|Downtown]] or Uptown Albuquerque; however, there are some high-rises scattered throughout other areas of the city, including the [[Bank of the West Tower]], which stands as the tallest building outside of Downtown. Overall, Albuquerque has 36 completed high-rise buildings, more than any other city in New Mexico.<ref name="EMPMain">{{Cite web|title=Skyscrapers of Albuquerque|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/bu/sk/?id=102790|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref> However, no Albuquerque buildings are among [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|the tallest in the United States]].

[[As of March 2008]], there is only one high-rise building under construction in Albuquerque: the Anasazi Downtown. When completed, it will rise 136&nbsp;feet (41&nbsp;m) in height with nine stories, including six stories of condominiums.<ref name="ANASAZI">{{cite web|title=Anasazi Downtown|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=anasazidowntown-albuquerque-nm-usa|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> There are also three proposals to build skyscrapers in Albuquerque, the largest of these being the [[The Residences at Packard Place]] and the [[Chant Tower]]; both towers are planned to rise 30 stories.<ref name="PACKARD">{{cite web|title=The Residences at Packard Place|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=streetresidencesatpackardplace-albuquerque-nm-usa|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref><ref name="CHANT">{{cite web|title=Chant Tower|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=i25jeffersontower-albuquerque-nm-usa|publisher=Emporis.com|accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref> If completed, both structures would surpass the Albuquerque Plaza Office Tower to become the tallest buildings in the city and the state.
