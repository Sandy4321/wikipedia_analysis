'''Platformism''' is a tendency within the wider [[anarchist]] movement which shares an affinity with organising in the tradition of [[Dielo Truda|Dielo Truda's]] ''Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''<ref name=Platformtext>{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda group |authorlink=Dielo Trouda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=2006-10-24 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy}}</ref>.  The ''Platform'' came from the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 [[October Revolution]], which led eventually to the victory of [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other like-minded groups.  The ''Platform'' attempted to explain and address the failure of the anarchist movement during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].  As a controversial pamphlet, the Platform drew both praise and [[Dielo Truda#Controversy|criticism from anarchists]] worldwide.

==History==
The ''Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''  was written in 1926 by ''[[Dielo Truda]]'' ("Workers' Cause"), a group of exiled Russian [[anarchists in France]].  The pamphlet is an analysis of the basic anarchist beliefs, a vision of an anarchist society, and recommendations as to how an anarchist organization should be structured. The four main principles by which an anarchist organization should operate, according to the ''Platform'', are ideological unity, tactical unity, [[collective action]], discipline, and [[federalism]]. 

Until recently, the platform was known in English as the ''Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists'', because the English translation was based on [[Voline]]'s mis-translation of the original and not the Russian original{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

The platform argues that "We have vital need of an organization which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement".

==Principles==

The Platform has 4 key organizational features which distinguish it from the rest of the anarchist movement. They are:

* '''Tactical Unity''' - A common tactical line in the movement is of decisive importance for the existence of the organisation and the whole movement: it avoids the disastrous effect of several tactics opposing each other; it concentrates the forces of the movement; and gives them a common direction leading to a fixed objective.<ref>From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]</ref>
* '''Theoretical Unity''' - "Theory represents the force which directs the activity of persons and organisations along a defined path towards a determined goal. Naturally it should be common to all the persons and organisations adhering to the General Union. All activity by the General Union, both overall and in its details, should be in perfect concord with the theoretical principles professed by the union."<ref>From section on theoretical unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform] </ref>
* '''Collective Responsibility''' - "The practice of acting on one's personal responsibility should be decisively condemned and rejected in the ranks of the anarchist movement. The areas of revolutionary life, social and political, are above all profoundly collective by nature. Social revolutionary activity in these areas cannot be based on the personal responsibility of individual militants."<ref>From section on Collective responsibility in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform] </ref>
* '''Federalism''' - "Against centralism, anarchism has always professed and defended the principle of federalism, which reconciles the independence and initiative of individuals and the organisation with service to the common cause."<ref>All sourced from the [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm From section Federalism within the Organizational Section of the original document]</ref>

== The Platform today ==
Today there are platformist groups in many countries including the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland, [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] (NEFAC, or ''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des Communistes Libertaires du Nord-Est'') in the northeastern USA, the ''[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Communiste_Libertaire|Union Communiste Libertaire]'' in [[Quebec]], Common Cause[http://www.linchpin.ca] in [[Ontario]], the ''[[Organizaci<U+00F3>n Comunista Libertaria]]'' (OCL) in [[Chile]], the [[Federation of Anarchists of Greece]] (OAE) in [[Greece]], ''[[Anarchist Communist Initiative]]'' (AKI) in [[Turkey]], ''[[Organizacion Socialista Libertaria]]'' (OSL) in [[Argentina]], the ''[[Federazione dei Comunisti Anarchici]]'' (FdCA) in Italy, the ''[[Coletivo pr<U+00F3> Organiza<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Anarquista em Goi<U+00E1>s]]'' in [[Brazil]], ''[[Grupo Qhispikay Llaqta]]'' in [[Peru]], the [[Libertarian Communist Organization (France)]] in France, the ''[[Alianza de los Comunistas Libertarios]]'' (ACL) in [[Mexico]], Melbourne Anarchist Communist Group (MACG) and [[Sydney Anarchist Communist Trajectory]] (SACT) in [[Australia]], [[Liberty and Solidarity]] in the [[UK]], and the [[Zabalaza Anarchist Communist Federation]] (ZACF) in [[South Africa]].
