'''Bristol Parkway railway station''', on the [[South Wales Main Line]], is in the [[Stoke Gifford]] area of the [[Bristol]] [[conurbation]]. It is {{convert|112|miles|km}} from [[Paddington station|London Paddington]]. Its three-letter station code is '''BPW'''. The station, opened in 1971, was the first in a new generation of [[park and ride]] stations. It is the third-most heavily used station in the [[West of England]], after {{rws|Bristol Temple Meads}} and {{rws|Bath Spa}}. There are three platforms, and a well-equipped waiting area. The station is managed by [[First Great Western]], who provide most of the trains at the station, with [[CrossCountry]] providing the rest.

The line is not electrified, but will be as part of the [[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line|planned modernisation of the Great Western Main Line]]. A new platform will also be built, allowing increased services from London.

== Description ==
Bristol Parkway is located in the unitary authority of [[South Gloucestershire]], in the [[Stoke Gifford]] area of the [[Bristol urban area|Bristol conurbation]].

Bristol Parkway was the first of a new generation of [[park and ride]] railway stations, and a large number of passengers use it for that purpose.

The line through Bristol Parkway was originally opened in 1903 as part of the [[Great Western Railway]]'s "Badminton Line" from [[Wootton Bassett]] to {{rws|Patchway}}, a short-cut for trains from London to South Wales, avoiding [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath]] and {{rws|Chippenham}}.<ref name="Oakley"/> It was built on the site of the Stoke Gifford marshalling yard, which closed on 4 October 1971, having become surplus to requirements with the cessation of [[wagonload freight]] trains.<ref name="badminton">{{cite book|title=GWR: The Badminton Line <U+2013> Portrait of a Railway|author=Robertson, Kevin; Abbot, David|isbn=0-86299-459-4|publisher=[[Alan Sutton Publishing]]|year=1988|pages=202<U+2013>206}}</ref> The station's development was seen as a response to the potential growth of housing and commercial developments in north Bristol, with proximity to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[M5 motorway|M5]] motorway interchange at [[Almondsbury Interchange|Almondsbury]] also important.<ref name="Oakley"/> The name "Parkway" came from proximity to the [[M32 motorway]], known as the Bristol Parkway,<ref name="bbchistory"/> although the term Parkway has since been applied to park and ride stations throughout the United Kingdom.<ref name="Baker"/> When the station was built it was outside the developed urban area, but the growth of housing and commercial development in adjoining areas of the [[North Fringe of Bristol|North Fringe]] has brought it within the conurbation, with many large office complexes being opened nearby.<ref name="OS"/><ref name="atocstp"/><ref name="OS1946">{{cite book |title=OS 1" 7th Series No. 156 <U+2013> Bristol & Stroud |year=1946 |publisher=[[Ordnance Survey]] |location=[[Southampton]]}}</ref><ref name="aerial">{{cite web|url=http://www.sbarch.org.uk/History_SG_V3.40/Aerial_Photographs/Aerial_Photos.shtml|title=History of Stoke Gifford <U+2013> Aerial Photographs of the Parish|editor=Kerton, Adrian|accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>

The station, owned by [[British Rail]], opened on 1 May 1972.<ref name="Butt">{{Butt-Stations| page=44}}</ref> Services were operated by the [[Western Region of British Rail|Western Region]] until British Rail was split into business-led sectors in the 1980s, after which Parkway was served by the [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] and [[Regional Railways]] divisions. The original structures, built by Stone & Co. of Bristol, were basic <U+2013> two island platforms connected by an open metal footbridge, with a wood and brick building containing the booking facilities and waiting rooms. Platform 1 (the modern platform 3), on the north side of the tracks, was for trains towards London and Birmingham, and platform 2 was for trains towards Wales and Bristol Temple Meads.

In the early 2000s, the [[Royal Mail]] began construction of the West of England Post Office Rail Depot just to the east of the station, taking over some of the station car park to provide a platform and warehouse for postal trains. The {{convert|12000|ft2|m2}} building opened in 2002, with the Royal Mail stating it would save {{convert|250000|miles|km}} of lorry journeys per year on local roads.<ref name="Oakley"/><ref name="postpost"/> However, the depot closed only two years later in 2004, when the Post Office ceased to use the rail network.<ref name="parlipost">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN02251.pdf|title=Railways: Royal Mail services, 2003<U+2013>|date=13 April 2010|author=Butcher, Louise|accessdate=29 September 2013|publisher=[[House of Commons Library]]}}</ref> Royal Mail offered the terminal for use by freight companies, but there were no takers.<ref name="postpost">{{cite news|title=Ex-mail Depot Set For New Use|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|work=[[Bristol Evening Post]]|date=3 July 2006|url=}}</ref> In 2008 it was reopened as a Network Rail maintenance training centre in a <U+00A3>2,500,000 project which saw the construction of a [[mezzanine]] floor, a welding workshop and a {{convert|4000|ft2|m2}} extension.<ref name="curtins"/><ref name="ontrack">{{cite news|title=The Bristol training centre putting engineers on track|work=[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk This is Bristol]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|date=8 August 2008|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Bristol-training-centre-putting-engineers-track/story-11312755-detail/story.html|accessdate=29 September 2013}}</ref>

In 2000, work began on a complete redevelopment of the station building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys to and from the station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility.<ref name="Oakley"/> A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003.<ref name="atocstp"/> In 2006, construction started on a new platform face on the north side of platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister [[Tom Harris (British politician)|Tom Harris MP]]. As part of the reconstruction, the waiting room at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost <U+00A3>3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing <U+00A3>100,000 towards the new waiting room and help desk.<ref name="nrnewplat">{{cite press release|url=http://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/content/detail.aspx?releaseid=3005&newsareaid=2&searchcategoryid=7|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=9 May 2007|publisher=[[Network Rail]]|title=New platform for Bristol Parkway}}</ref>

Despite the large car park, the increase in passenger numbers at Parkway in recent years has led to problems with on-street parking, leading to the commissioning of a new 200-space car park {{convert|500|m|yd}} east of the station.<ref name="atocstp"/><ref name="postnewpr">{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Park-ride-cars-road/story-11233281-detail/story.html|title=New Bristol park and ride to keep cars off road|accessdate=29 September 2013|date=6 July 2009|work=[http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk This is Bristol]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]}}</ref> It opened in Spring 2011, but was used by only 139 motorists in its first three months, and as of August 2012 was averaging only 10 motorists per day.
