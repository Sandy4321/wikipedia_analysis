'''Janet Damita Jo Jackson''' (born May 16, 1966) is an American recording artist and actress. Known for a series of sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows, television and film roles, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over 25 years. She is ranked by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine as one of the richest women in entertainment. The youngest child of the [[Jackson family]], she began her career with the variety television series ''[[The Jacksons (TV series)|The Jacksons]]'' in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including ''[[Good Times]]'' and ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]''.

After signing a recording contract with A&M in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album ''[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'' (1986). Her collaborations with record producers [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] incorporated elements of [[rhythm and blues]], [[funk]], [[disco]], [[rapping|rap]], and [[industrial music|industrial]] beats, which led to crossover appeal in [[popular music]]. In addition to receiving recognition for the innovation in her records, choreography, music videos, and prominence on radio airplay and [[MTV]], she was acknowledged as a role model for her socially conscious lyrics. 

In 1991, she signed the first of two record-breaking, multi-million dollar contracts with [[Virgin Records]], establishing her as one of the highest paid artists in the industry. Her debut album under the label, ''[[Janet (album)|Janet]]'' (1993), saw her develop a public image as a [[sex symbol]] as she began to explore sexuality in her work. That same year, she appeared in her first starring film role in ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''; since then she has continued to act in feature films. By the end of the 1990s, she was named the second most successful recording artist of the decade, following [[Mariah Carey]]. She has amassed an extensive catalog of hits, with singles such as "[[Nasty (song)|Nasty]]", "[[Rhythm Nation]]", "[[That's the Way Love Goes (Janet Jackson song)|That's the Way Love Goes]]", "[[Together Again (Janet Jackson song)|Together Again]]" and "[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]" among her most iconic.

In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with [[Motown]], and by the end of the year they had recorded the first of four consecutive number one singles. The Jackson 5's success allowed the family to move to the [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1971, where they settled in a gated mansion called Hayvenhurst.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> Although born into a family of professional musicians, Jackson, whose love of horses resulted in a desire to become a race-horse jockey, had no aspiration to become an entertainer. Despite this, her father planned for her to pursue a career in entertainment. She once commented, "No one ever asked me if I wanted to go into show business&nbsp;... it was expected."<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/>

In 1973, at the age of seven, Jackson appeared on stage in [[Las Vegas Strip]] with her siblings in a routine show at the MGM Casino.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> Jane Cornwell documented in her biography of the singer, ''Janet Jackson'' (2002), that at age eight, her father Joseph told her not to call him "Dad" anymore since he was her manager; he told her she would henceforth address him as "Joseph".<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> She began her career as an actress with the debut of the CBS variety show ''[[The Jacksons (TV series)|The Jacksons]]'' (1976), in which she appeared with her siblings Tito, [[Rebbie Jackson|Rebbie]], [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy]], Michael, Marlon, [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] and Jackie.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> In 1977, she was selected by producer [[Norman Lear]] to play a recurring role as [[Good Times|Penny Gordon Woods]] in the sitcom ''[[Good Times]]''.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> From 1979 to 1980, she starred in ''[[A New Kind of Family]]'' as Jojo Ashton, and then joined the cast of ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', portraying Charlene Duprey from 1981 to 1982.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> She played a recurring role during the fourth season of the television series ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]'' as Cleo Hewitt, though she later commented that the series was not a project she enjoyed working on.<ref>{{Citation | last = Fox | first = Norman | title = ''Indian Summer'' | publisher=tv.com | url = http://www.tv.com/fame/indian-summer/episode/77620/summary.html | accessdate = 2008-09-03}}</ref><ref name="Saunders">{{Citation |last= Saunders |first= Michael | title=The 3 Divas Janet Jackson turns her focus inward | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | page=D13 | date=1996-10-03}}</ref>

Although Jackson was initially apprehensive about starting a music career, she agreed to participate in recording sessions with her family. The first of these, a duet with her brother Randy titled "Love Song for Kids", took place in 1978. When she was sixteen, her father arranged a contract for her with [[A&M Records]].<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> Her debut album, ''[[Janet Jackson (album)|Janet Jackson]]'', produced by [[soul music|soul]] singers [[Angela Winbush]], [[Ren<U+00E9> Moore]] and Leon F.

Jackson's second album, ''[[Dream Street (Janet Jackson album)|Dream Street]]'', was released two years later. Her father recruited her brothers to help produce the album: Marlon co-wrote two of the album's tracks, while Tito, Jackie and Michael provided background vocals.<ref name="JJ by Cornwell"/> ''Dream Street'' reached number nineteen on the R&B albums chart; its sales were less than that of her debut album.<ref name="Billboard Album peaks"/> The album's only hit, "[[Don't Stand Another Chance]]", peaked at number nine on ''Billboard''{{'}}s R&B singles chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/#/charts/r-b-hip-hop-songs?chartDate=1984-10-20 |title = Top Hip-Hop and R&B Songs & Singles Charts |work=Billboard |accessdate= 2010-06-12}}</ref> In late 1984, Jackson eloped with childhood friend and fellow R&B singer [[James DeBarge]].

{{listen|filename=Janet Jackson - Nasty.ogg|title="Nasty" (1986)|description="Nasty" was written as a response to an incident of sexual harassment Jackson faced during the recording of ''Control''. The song features a triplet swing beat.}}

Following the release of ''Dream Street'', Jackson decided to separate her business affairs from her family. She later commented, "I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again."<ref name="Saunders"/> A&M Records executive John McClain hired producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to work with her.

She stated that "[t]he danger hit home when a couple of guys started stalking me on the street&nbsp;... Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense."<ref name="Sexual Healing"/>

Jackson's [[All for You Tour]] began in July, 2001. ''Los Angeles Times''' pop music critic Robert Hilburn gave a negative review of the concert tour, comparing it unfavorably to Madonna's [[Drowned World Tour]] and [[Britney Spears]]' [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]]. Hilburn remarked: "At 35, Jackson is only eight years younger than Madonna, but her presentation feels more akin to Britney Spears'.

For the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] halftime show in February 2004, Jackson performed a medley of her singles "All for You" and "Rhythm Nation"; she then performed alongside [[Justin Timberlake]]. As Timberlake sang the lyric "gonna have you naked by the end of this song" from his single "[[Rock Your Body]]", he tore open her top, exposing her right breast.

A surprising number of the new superstars were black.

Musicologist Richard J.
