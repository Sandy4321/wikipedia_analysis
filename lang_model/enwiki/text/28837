'''Robert "Bob" Nesta Marley''' [[Jamaican Order of Merit|OM]] ([[February 6]], [[1945]] <U+2013> [[May 11]] [[1981]]) was a [[Jamaica]]n [[singer]], [[songwriter]], [[guitarist]], and [[activism|activist]]. He is the most widely known performer of [[reggae]] music. A faithful [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]], Marley is regarded by many as a [[prophet]] of the religion.<ref name=prophet>Smith, W. Alan, ''[http://www.religiouseducation.net/member/05_rea_papers/wasmith_2005.pdf Songs of Freedom: The Music of Bob Marley as Transformative Education]</ref>

Marley is best known for his [[reggae]] songs, which include the hits "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]", "[[No Woman, No Cry]]", "[[Three Little Birds]]", "Exodus", "[[Could You Be Loved]]", "Jammin", "[[Redemption Song]]", and "[[One Love (Bob Marley song)|One Love]]".<ref name=EB>"Bob Marley," ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', 2006.</ref> His posthumous compilation album ''[[Legend (album)|Legend]]'' (1984) is the best-selling reggae album ever, with sales of more than 12 million copies.<ref name=EB/>

== Early life and career ==
Marley was born in the small village of Nine Mile in [[Saint Ann Parish]], [[Jamaica]]. His father, [[Norval Marley|Norval Sinclair Marley]] (born in 1895), was a Jamaican of [[English people|English]] descent, with parents from [[Sussex]]. Norval was a [[Royal Marines|Marine officer]] and captain, as well as a [[plantation]] overseer, when he married [[Cedella Booker]], a black Jamaican then eighteen years old. Norval provided financial support for his wife and child, but seldom saw them, as he was often away on trips. Marley was ten years old when his father died of a heart attack in 1955 at age 60.

Marley suffered [[racial prejudice]] as a youth, because of his [[multiracial|mixed racial origins]],<ref>[http://www.uvm.edu/~debate/dreadlibrary/gurtman02.htm UVM.edu]</ref> and faced questions about his own racial identity throughout his life. He once reflected:

<blockquote>I don't have prejudice against myself. My father was a white and my mother was black. Them call me half-caste or whatever. Me don't dip on nobody's side. Me don't dip on the black man's side nor the white man's side. Me dip on God's side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white.</blockquote>

Marley and his mother moved to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston's]] [[Trenchtown]] slum after Norval's death. He was forced to learn [[self-defense]], as he became the target of bullying because of his racial makeup and small stature (5'4" or 163&nbsp;cm tall) {{Fact|date=May 2007}}. He gained a reputation for his physical strength, which earned him the nickname "Tuff Gong".

Marley became friends with Neville "Bunny" Livingston (later known as [[Bunny Wailer]]), with whom he started to play music. He left school at the age of 14 and started as an apprentice at a local welder's shop. In his free time, he and Livingston made music with [[Joe Higgs]], a local singer and devout [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] who is regarded by many as Marley's mentor. It was at a [[jam session]] with Higgs and Livingston that Marley met Peter McIntosh (later known as [[Peter Tosh]]), who had similar musical ambitions.

In 1962, Marley recorded his first two singles, "[[Judge Not]]" and "One Cup of Coffee", with local music producer [[Leslie Kong]]. These songs, released on the [[Beverley's]] label under the pseudonym of Bobby Martell,<ref>[http://www.bobmarley.com/life/musicbusiness/beverley.html The Beverley Label and Leslie Kong: Music Business] at bobmarley.com</ref> attracted little attention. The songs were later re-released on the album ''[[Songs of Freedom]]'', a posthumous collection of Marley's songs.

== Musical career ==
=== The Wailers ===
[[Image:Wailers group high res(resized).jpg|thumb|220px|The Wailers in the mid-1960s. From left to right: [[Bunny Wailer]], Bob Marley, [[Peter Tosh]].]]
In 1963, Bob Marley, Bunny Livingston, [[Peter Tosh|Peter McIntosh]], [[Junior Braithwaite]], [[Beverley Kelso]], and [[Cherry Smith]] formed a [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]] group, calling themselves "The Teenagers". They later changed their name to "The Wailing Rudeboys", then to "The Wailing Wailers", and finally to "[[The Wailers (reggae)|The Wailers]]". By 1966, Braithwaite, Kelso, and Smith had left The Wailers, leaving the core trio of Marley, Livingston, and McIntosh.

Marley took on the role of leader, singer, and main songwriter. Much of The Wailers' early work, including their first single ''[[Simmer Down]]'', was produced by [[Coxsone Dodd]] at [[Studio One]]. Simmer Down topped Jamaican Charts in 1964 and established The Wailers as one of the hottest groups in the country. They followed up with songs such as "Soul Rebel" and "400 Years".

In 1966, Marley married [[Rita Marley|Rita Anderson]], and moved near his mother's residence in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] for a few months. Upon returning to Jamaica, Marley became a member of the Rastafari movement, and started to wear his trademark [[dreadlocks]] (''see the ''[[Bob Marley#Religion|religion section]]'' for more on Marley's religious views'').

After a conflict with Dodd, Marley and his band teamed up with [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] and his studio band, [[The Upsetters]]. Although the alliance lasted less than a year, they recorded what many consider The Wailers' finest work. Marley and Perry split after a dispute regarding the assignment of recording rights, but they would remain friends and work together again.

Between 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter McIntosh and Bunny Livingston re-cut some old tracks with [[JAD Records]] in Kingston and [[London]] in an attempt to commercialize The Wailers' sound. Livingston later asserted that these songs "should never be released on an album <U+2026> they were just demos for record companies to listen to."

[[Image:JAD bob resized.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
The Wailers' first album, ''[[Catch A Fire]]'', was released worldwide in 1973, and sold well. It was followed a year later by ''[[Burnin']]'', which included the songs "[[Get Up, Stand Up]]" and "[[I Shot The Sheriff]]". [[Eric Clapton]] made a hit cover of "I Shot the Sheriff" in 1974, raising Marley's international profile.

The Wailers broke up in 1974 with each of the three main members going on to pursue solo careers. The reason for the breakup is shrouded in conjecture; some believe that there were disagreements amongst Livingston, McIntosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Livingston and McIntosh simply preferred solo work. McIntosh began recording under the name [[Peter Tosh]], and Livingston continued as Bunny Wailer.

=== Bob Marley & The Wailers ===
Despite the breakup, Marley continued recording as "Bob Marley & The Wailers". His new [[Wailers Band|backing band]] included brothers [[Carlton Barrett|Carlton]] and [[Aston Barrett|Aston "Family Man" Barrett]] on drums and bass respectively, [[Junior Marvin]] and [[Al Anderson (Wailers)|Al Anderson]] on lead guitar, [[Tyrone Downie]] and [[Earl Lindo|Earl "Wya" Lindo]] on keyboards, and [[Alvin Patterson|Alvin "Seeco" Patterson]] on percussion. The "[[I Threes]]", consisting of [[Judy Mowatt]], [[Marcia Griffiths]], and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals. 

In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, "[[No Woman, No Cry]]" from the ''[[Natty Dread]]'' album. This was followed by his breakthrough album in the [[United States|US]], ''[[Rastaman Vibration]]'' (1976), which spent four weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard charts]] Top Ten.

In December 1976, two days before "[[Smile Jamaica Concert|Smile Jamaica]]", a free concert organized by the Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] in an attempt to ease tension between two warring political groups, Marley, his wife, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault by unknown gunmen inside Marley's home. Taylor and Marley's wife sustained serious injuries, but later made full recoveries. Bob Marley received only minor injuries in the chest and arm. The shooting was thought to have been politically motivated, as many felt the concert was really a support rally for Manley<!--Manley is correct, do not change it to Marley-->. Nonetheless, the concert proceeded, and an injured Marley performed as scheduled.


[[Image:Bob Marley Live-Painting by Steve Brogdon1992.jpg|thumb|right|400px]]
Marley left Jamaica at the end of 1976 for [[England]], where he recorded his ''[[Exodus (album)|Exodus]]'' and ''[[Kaya (album)|Kaya]]'' albums. ''Exodus'' stayed on the British album charts for 56 consecutive weeks. It included four UK hit singles: "Exodus", "Waiting In Vain", "Jamming", "One Love", and a rendition of [[Curtis Mayfield]]'s hit, "[[People Get Ready (song)|People Get Ready]]". It was here that he was arrested and received a conviction for possession of a small quantity of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] while traveling in London.
{{Main|One Love Peace Concert}}

In 1978, Marley performed at another political concert in Jamaica, the [[One Love Peace Concert]], again in an effort to calm warring parties. Near the end of the performance, by Marley's request, Manley<!--Manley is correct, do not change it to Marley--> and his political rival, [[Edward Seaga]], joined each other on stage and shook hands.

''[[Survival (album)|Survival]]'', a defiant and politically charged album, was released in 1979. Tracks such as "Zimbabwe", "[[Africa Unite]]", "Wake Up and Live", and "Survival" reflected Marley's support for the struggles of [[Africa]]ns. In early [[1980]], he was invited to perform at the [[April 17]] celebration of [[Zimbabwe]]'s Independence Day.

''[[Uprising (album)|Uprising]]'' (1980) was Bob Marley's final studio album, and is one of his most religious productions, including "[[Redemption Song]]" and "Forever Loving Jah". It was in "Redemption Song" that Marley sang the famous lyric,

{{cquote|Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery<br>None but ourselves can free our minds<U+2026>|10px}}

''[[Confrontation (album)|Confrontation]]'', released posthumously in 1983, contained unreleased material recorded during Marley's lifetime, including the hit "[[Buffalo Soldier (song)|Buffalo Soldier]]" and new mixes of singles previously only available in Jamaica.

== Later years ==
=== Cancer diagnosis ===
In July 1977, Marley was found to have [[malignant melanoma]] in a [[Football (soccer)|football]] wound on his right [[hallux]] (big toe). Marley refused amputation, citing worries that the operation would affect his dancing, as well as the Rastafari belief that the body must be "whole":

{{cquote|Rasta no abide amputation. I don't allow a man to be dismantled.|10px|10px|From the biography ''Catch a Fire''}}

Marley may have seen [[physicians|medical doctors]] as ''samfai'' (tricksters, deceivers). True to this belief Marley went against all surgical possibilities and sought out other means that would not break his religious beliefs. He also refused to register a [[will (law)|will]], based on the Rastafari belief that writing a will is acknowledging death as inevitable, thus disregarding the everlasting character of life.

=== Collapse and treatment ===
The [[cancer]] then [[metastasis|metastasized]] to Marley's [[brain]], [[lung]]s, [[liver]], and [[stomach]]. After playing two shows at [[Madison Square Garden]] as part of his fall 1980 [[Uprising Tour]], he collapsed while jogging in [[New York City|NYC's]] [[Central Park]]. The remainder of the tour was subsequently cancelled.

Bob Marley played his final concert at the [[Benedum Center|Stanley Theater]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] on [[September 23]], [[1980]]. The live version of "[[Redemption Song]]" on ''[[Songs of Freedom]]'' was recorded at this show.<ref>http://www.bobmarley.com/songs/songs.cgi?redemption</ref> Marley afterwards sought medical help from [[Munich]] specialist [[Josef Issels]], but his cancer had already progressed to the terminal stage.

=== Death and posthumous reputation ===
While flying home from [[Germany]] to Jamaica for his final days, Marley became ill, and landed in Miami for immediate medical attention. He died at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in [[Miami, Florida]] on the morning of [[May 11]], [[1981]] at the age of 36. His final words to his son [[Ziggy Marley|Ziggy]] were "Money can't buy life."<ref name="timeline">{{cite web

Marley received a [[state funeral]] in Jamaica, which combined elements of [[Ethiopian]] Orthodoxy and Rastafari tradition. He was buried in a crypt near his birthplace with his [[Gibson Les Paul]], a soccer ball, a marijuana bud, a ring that he wore every day that was given to him by the Prince Asfa Wossen of Ethiopia (eldest son of [[His Imperial Majesty|HIM]]), and a [[Bible]]. A month before his death, he was awarded the [[Jamaican Order of Merit]].

Bob Marley's music has continuously grown in popularity in the years since his death, providing a stream of revenue for his estate and affording him a mythical status in [[20th century]] music history. He remains enormously popular and well-known all over the world, particularly so in Africa. Marley was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[1994]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine chose Bob Marley & The Wailers' ''[[Exodus (album)|Exodus]]'' as the greatest album of the 20th century.

In 2001, the same year that Marley was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]], a feature-length documentary about his life, <em>Rebel Music</em>, was nominated for Best Long Form Music Video documentary at [[Grammy Awards|the Grammys]]. It won various other awards. With contributions from Rita, the Wailers, and Marley's lovers and children, it also tells much of the story in his own words.

In Summer [[2006]], the City of New York renamed a portion of Church Avenue from Remsen Avenue to East 98th Street in the [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]] Section of [[Brooklyn]] <em>Bob Marley Blvd</em>.<ref>[http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&aid=60701 Brooklyn Street Renamed Bob Marley Boulevard]</ref>

== Religion ==
Bob Marley was a member of the [[Rastafari movement]], whose culture was a key element in the development of reggae. Bob Marley became the leading proponent of the Rastafari, taking their music out of the socially deprived areas of Jamaica and onto the international music scene.

Now considered a "Rasta" legend, Marley's adoption of the characteristic Rastafari dreadlocks and famous use of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] as a [[Religious use of cannabis|sacred sacrament]] in the late sixties were an integral part of his persona. He is said to have entered every performance proclaiming the divinity of [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Jah Rastafari]].

Many of Marley's songs contained Biblical references, sometimes using wordplay to fuse activism and religion, as in "Revolution" and "Revelation":

{{cquote|Revelation reveals the truth <U+2026>|10px}}
{{cquote|It takes a revolution to make a solution <U+2026>|10px}}

After his travels to Ethiopia, Bob Marley became a convert to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] after receiving the sacrament of baptism. Marley died an Orthodox Christian.

== Children ==
Bob Marley had 13 children: three with his wife [[Rita Marley|Rita]], two adopted from Rita's previous relationships, and the remaining eight with separate women.<ref>Dixon, Meredith.[http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/dixon.html "Lovers and Children of the Natural Mystic: The Story of Bob Marley, Women and their Children"] ''The Dread Library'' (Accessed 21 June 2007)</ref> His children are, in order of birth:
