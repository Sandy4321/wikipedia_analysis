'''William Henry Harrison''' ([[February 9]], [[1773]] <U+2013> [[April 4]], [[1841]]) was an [[Military history of the United States|American military leader]], [[Politics of the United States|politician]], and the ninth [[President of the United States]]. He served as the first [[Governor of Indiana Territory|Governor]] of the [[Indiana Territory]] and later as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Ohio]]. Harrison first gained national fame for leading U.S. forces against [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] in 1811, where he earned the [[nickname]] "Tippecanoe" (or "Old Tippecanoe"). As a [[general]] in the subsequent [[War of 1812]], his most notable contribution was a victory at the [[Battle of the Thames]], which brought the war in his region to a successful conclusion.

After the war Harrison moved to Ohio, where he was elected to [[United States Congress]] and in 1824 to the [[United States Senate|Senate]], where we served a truncated term before being appointed as [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to [[Colombia]] in May 1828. In Colombia he lectured [[Simon Bolivar]] on the finer points of democracy before returning to his farm in Ohio, where he lived in relative retirement until he was nominated for the presidency in 1836. Defeated, he retired again to his farm before accepting his second presidential nomination in 1840.

When Harrison took office in 1841 at the age of 68, he was the [[List of United States Presidents by age|oldest]] man to become President - a record that stood for 140&nbsp;years, until [[Ronald Reagan]] was inaugurated in 1981 at the age of 69. Harrison died thirty-one days into his term <U+2013> the [[List of United States Presidents by time in office|briefest presidency]] in the history of the office. He was also the first U.S. President to die while in office. His death created a brief [[constitutional crisis]] over [[United States presidential line of succession#Acting President and President| presidential succession]].

==Early life==
===Family background and childhood===
Harrison was born into a prominent [[List of U.S. political families#The Harrisons|political family]] on the [[Berkeley Plantation]] in [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]] [[Virginia]], the youngest of the seven children of [[Benjamin Harrison V]] and Elizabeth Bassett. His father was a Virginia planter who served as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] (1774<U+2013>1777), signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (1776), and was [[Governor of Virginia]] (1781-1784).<ref>Owen, p. 3</ref> William Henry Harrison's brother, [[Carter Bassett Harrison]], later became a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], representing Virginia. Harrison's father-in-law was [[Congressman]] [[John Cleves Symmes]]. His stepmother-in-law was the daughter of [[New Jersey]] [[Governor]] [[William Livingston]]. He was the first cousin of Congresman [[Burwell Bassett]] on his mother's side. Harrison was the last President who was born a British subject.<ref name = wh>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/wh9.html| title= William Henry Harrison Biography|publiher= whitehouse.gov|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

At age 14 Harrison entered [[Hampden-Sydney College]], but was removed by his father after he became involved with anti-slavery [[Methodist]]s and [[Quakers]]. Later, Harrison attended the University of Pennsylvania, and began the study of  medicine under Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]]. As he explained in his biography, he did not enjoy the profession of medicine; when his father died in 1791, he was left without money for further schooling . Harrison was 18 when his father died, and he was left in the guardianship of [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/kids/presidents/williamhenryharrison.html |publisher=whitehouse.gov|title=William Henry Harrison Biography|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref><ref name = l160>Langguth, p 160</ref>In 1793 Harrison's mother died, and he inherited a portion of the family's estate, including about three thousand acres of land and several slaves. Harrison sold his land to his brother after he entered the army.<ref>Owen, p. 39</ref>

In 1795 Harrison met Anna Symmes, of [[North Bend, Ohio]]. She was the daughter of Judge [[John Cleves Symmes]], a prominent figure in Ohio. When Harrison approached the Judge asking permission to marry Anna, he was refused.  Harrison waited until the Judge left on business, then he and Anna eloped and were married on November 25, 1795.<ref>Owen, pp. 38, 39</ref> After the marriage, the Judge was concerned about Harrison's ability to provide for Anna, and sold to the young couple 160 acres of land in North Bend.<ref>Owen, p. 40</ref> Together the couple had ten children, six sons and four daughters. Nine lived into adulthood and one died in infancy. Anna was frequently in poor health during the marriage, mainly due to her frequent pregnancy.<ref>Owen, p. 56</ref> However, she outlived William by 23&nbsp;years, dying aged 88 on [[February 25]] [[1864]].

===Early Military Career===
[[Henry Lee III|Governor Lee]] of [[Virginia]], a friend of Benjamin Harrison V, heard of Harrison's situation and persuaded him to join the army. Within 24&nbsp;hours of meeting and discussing his future with Lee, Harrison, at the age of 18, was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], 11th U.S. Regt. of Infantry. He was first sent to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] in the [[Northwest Territory]] where the army was engaged in the ongoing [[Northwest Indian War]].<ref>Owen, p. 14</ref><ref>Green, p. 22</ref>

[[General]] [[Anthony Wayne|"Mad Anthony" Wayne]] took command of the western army in 1792. Harrison was promoted to lieutenant that summer because of his strict attention to discipline. The following year he was promoted to serve as [[aide-de-camp]].  It was Wayne from whom Harrison learned how to successfully command an army on the [[American frontier]]. Harrison participated in Wayne's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794, which brought the [[Northwest Indian War]] to a close.<ref>Owen, p. 27</ref><ref>Peckham, p. 102</ref> After the war, Lieutenant Harrison was one of the signers of the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795, which opened much of present-day Ohio to settlement by Americans.<ref>Owen, p. 21</ref><ref name = wh/><ref name = l160/><ref>Owen, pp. 27, 29</ref>

Harrison resigned from the army at the end of 1797 to become Secretary of the [[Northwest Territory]], and acted as [[governor]] when Governor [[Arthur St. Clair]] was absent.<ref>Owen, 41</ref><ref>Green, p. 9</ref><ref name = wh/><ref name = l160/>

===Congressman===
[[Image:William H. Harrison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This [[portrait]] of Harrison originally showed him in [[civilian]] clothes as the [[Sixth United States Congress|Congressional delegate]] from the [[Northwest Territory]] in 1800, but the uniform was added after he became famous in the War of 1812.]]

In 1799, at age 26, Harrison was elected as the first [[delegate]] representing the Northwest Territory in the [[Sixth United States Congress]], serving from [[March 4]], [[1799]], to [[May 14]], [[1800]].<ref name =cb>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=h000279| title= HARRISON, William Henry, (1773 - 1841)| publisher= [[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref><ref name = wh/> Because he was the delegate from a territory, and not a state, he had no authority to vote on bills. He was, however, permitted to serve on a committee, submit legislation, and debate.<ref>Owens, pp. 45, 46</ref> 

As delegate, he successfully promoted the passage of the [[Harrison Land Act]], which made it easier for the average settler to purchase land in the Northwest Territory by allowing land to be sold in small tracts. This sudden availability of cheap land was an important factor in the rapid population growth of the Northwest Territory.<ref>Languth, 161</ref> Harrison also served on the committee that decided how to divide the Northwest Territory. The committee recommended splitting the territory into two parts, creating the [[Ohio Territory]] and the [[Indiana Territory]]. The bill passed and the two new territories were established in 1800.<ref>Owens, p. 47, 48</ref>

Harrison resigned from Congress on appointment by [[United States President|President]] [[John Adams]] as governor of the newly formed [[Indiana Territory]].<ref>Owen, p. 53</ref> The Indiana Territory consisted of the future states of [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]] and the eastern portion of [[Minnesota]].<ref>Owens, p. 49, 50, 54</ref>

===Governor===

{{See also| History of slavery in Indiana}}

Harrison moved to [[Vincennes, Indiana| Vincennes]], the capital of the new territory, on January 10, 1801.<ref>Owen, p. 53</ref> While in Vincennes, Harrison built a plantation style home he named [[Grouseland]], for its many birds. It was one of the first brick structures in the territory. The home, which has been restored and has became a popular modern tourist attraction, served as the center of social and political life in the territory.<ref>Owen, p. 56</ref>  He also built a second home near [[Corydon, Indiana| Corydon]], the second capital, at [[Harrison Spring| Harrison Valley]].<ref name = funk>{{cite book|author= Funk, Arville|pages=167|title=A Sketchbook of Indiana History| year=1963|publisher=Christian Book Press|location=Rochester, Indiana}}</ref>

As governor, Harrison had wide ranging powers in the new territory, including the authority to appoint all territory officials and the territorial legislature, and control over the division of the territory into districts. A primary responsibility was to obtain title to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lands, so that white settlement could expand in the area, enabling the region eventually to attain statehood.<ref name = wh/> Harrison was also eager to expand the territory for personal reasons, as his own political fortunes were tied to Indiana's rise to statehood. In 1803 [[United States President| President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] granted Harrison authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians. Harrison oversaw the creation of thirteen treaties, purchasing more than {{convert|60000000|acre|km2}} of land, including much of present day [[Indiana]], from Native American leaders. The [[Treaty of Grouseland]] in 1805 was thought by Harrison to have appeased Native Americans. But tensions remained high on the frontier and became much greater after the 1809 [[Treaty of Fort Wayne]], in which Harrison illegally purchased more than 2,500,000&nbsp;acres (10,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of American Indian land.<ref>Owen, pp 65, 66, 79, 80, 92</ref><ref name = funk/>

In 1803 Harrison lobbied Congress to repeal Article 6 of the [[Northwest Ordinance]], to permit slavery in the Indiana Territory. He claimed it was necessary to make the region more appealing to settlers, and that it would ultimately make the territory economically viable.<ref>Owen, pp. 68, 69</ref> Congress suspended the article for ten years, and the territories covered by the ordinance were granted the right to decide for themselves whether to permit slavery. That same year Harrison had the apponted territorial legislature authorize [[indenture|indenturing]].<ref>Owen, pp. 72, 69</ref> He then attempted to have slavery legalized outright, in both 1805 and 1807. His attempts caused a significant stir in the territory. In 1809 the legislature was popularly elected for the first time and Harrison found himself at odds with the legislature when the [[abolition]]ist party came to power. They immediately blocked his plans for slavery, and repealed the indenturing laws he had passed in 1803.<ref>Gresham, p. 21</ref><ref>Owen, pp. 179, 180</ref>

===Army General===
====Tecumseh and Tippecanoe====
An Indian resistance movement against U.S. expansion had been growing around the [[Shawnee]] brothers [[Tecumseh]] and [[Tenskwatawa]] (The Prophet), that became known as [[Tecumseh's War]]. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns.<ref>Lannguth, pp. 158-160</ref>  In 1810 Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes were he confronted Harrison and demanded that the [[Treaty of Fort Wayne]] be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.<ref>Lannguth, pp. 164-166</ref> 

In 1811, while Tecumseh was still away, Harrison was authorized by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[William Eustice]] to march against the nascent confederation, as a show of force. Harrison moved north with an army of more than one thousand men in an attempt to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace. The ploy failed, and the tribes launched a surprise attack on Harrison's army early on the morning of [[November 6]]. The ensuing battle became known as the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. Harrison ultimately won his famous victory at [[Prophetstown]], next to the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Tippecanoe River]]s. Harrison was publicly hailed as a national hero, despite the fact that his troops had greatly outnumbered the Indian forces, and had suffered many more casualties.<ref>Lannguth, pp. 167&ndash;169</ref>

According to a legend, Tecumseh's brother, Tenskwatawa, had placed a curse on Harrison, that would supposedly cause every President to be elected in a year ending with the number zero (which happens every 20&nbsp;years) to die in office. This [[Curse of Tecumseh]] is sometimes called the "zero-year curse". Remarkably, although there is no documentary evidence to prove the curse was made, it in fact "came true" for Harrison, elected in 1840, as well as for the next six zero-year Presidents - [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[James Garfield|Garfield]], [[William McKinley|McKinley]], [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]].  [[Ronald Reagan]]'s survival of an [[Reagan assassination attempt|assassination attempt]] seems to have "broken the curse", and, so far, [[George W. Bush]] has evaded it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/uspresidents/a/tecumseh.htm |title=''Tecumseh's Curse and the US Presidents: Coincidence or Something More?|author=Martin Kelly|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

====War of 1812====

When Tecumseh's War merged with the [[War of 1812]], Harrison remained in command of the army in Indiana. After the loss of [[Detroit, Michigan| Detroit]], General [[James Winchester]] became the commander of the [[Army of the Northwest (United States)|Army of the Northwest]] and Harrison was offered the rank of [[Brigadier General]], which he refused. After a brief time interval, [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Madison]] removed Winchester and made Harrison the commander, on [[September 17]], [[1812]]. Harrison inherited an army made up of fresh recruits which he endeavored to drill. Initially he was greatly outnumbered, and assumed a defensive posture, but after receiving reinforcements in 1813 Harrison took the offensive, advancing the army farther north to battle the Indians and their new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] allies. He won victories in [[Indiana]] and [[Ohio]], and retook [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] before invading [[Canada]], where he crushed the British at the [[Battle of the Thames]], in which Tecumseh was killed.<ref>Lannguth, 268&ndash270</ref>

After the Battle of Thames the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] divided the command of Harrison's army, and assigned him to a backwater post and gave control of the front to one of Harrison's subordinates. Harrison had been having disagreements with [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John Armstrong, Jr.|John Armstrong]] over the lack of coordination and effectiveness of the invasion of Canada. When Harrison was reassigned, he promptly resigned from the army to prevent what he called an act that was "subversive [to] military order and discipline". His resignation was accepted in the summer of 1814.<ref name = l292>Lannguth, pp 291&ndash;292</ref>

After the war concluded, Congress investigated the circumstances of Harrison's resignation, and decided that he had been mistreated by the Secretary of War during his campaign, and that his resignation was justified. They also awarded Harrison a gold medal for his services to the nation during the War of 1812. The Battle of Thames was one of the great American victories in the war, second only to the [[Battle of New Orleans]].<ref name = l292/><ref>Lannguth, pp. 268&ndash;270</ref>

==Post-war life==
===Public office===
After the war Harrison was appointed by President [[James Madison]] to serve as a commissioner to negotiate two treaties with the Indians tribes in the northwest. Both treaties were advantageous to the [[United States]] and gained a large tract of land in the west for settlement.<ref name =cb/>

Harrison was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to finish the term of [[John McLean]] of Ohio, serving from [[October 8]], [[1816]], to [[March 4]], [[1819]]. He was elected and served in the [[Ohio State Senate]] from 1819 to 1821. He ran for [[governor of Ohio]] in 1820 but was defeated. In 1824, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served until [[May 20]], [[1828]]. In the Senate he became known for his impassioned debating. Harrison was referred to by fellow westerners in Congress as a [[Buckeye]], a term of endearment derived from the Buckeye [[chestnut]] tree.<ref name =cb/>

He resigned from the Senate in 1828 on appointment as [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to [[Colombia]], serving until [[March 8]], [[1829]].<ref name =cb/> He arrived in [[Bogota, Colombia| Bogota]] on [[December 22]], [[1828]]. He found the condition of Colombia saddening, and reported to the [[Secretary of State]] that the country was on the edge of anarchy, and that he thought [[Simon Bolivar]] was about to become a [[despot]]ic [[military dictator]]. While  minister in Colombia, Harrison wrote a lengthy letter of rebuke to Bolivar, stating "...the strongest of all governments is that which is most free." He called on Bolivar to refrain from terrorizing his enemies, and to encourage the development of a democracy. Harrison was recalled from his position when the new administration of President [[Andrew Jackson]] took office in March 1829. He arrived back in the United States in June.<ref>Hall, pp. 301&ndash;309</ref>

=== Private Citizen ===

After Harrison returned to the United States in 1829, he settled on his farm in [[North Bend, Ohio]], which was his adopted home state. There he entered into a state of relative retirement, after nearly 40&nbsp;years of continuous government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and from the income produced by his farm. He also earned money from his contributions to a biography written by James Hall, entitled ''A Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison'', published in 1836. By 1840, the time of his second run for President, there were more than a dozen books on the life of Harrison, in which he was hailed as a national hero.<ref>Burr, p. 257</ref>

On his farm, Harrison grew many acres of corn, and established a [[distillery]] to produce [[whiskey]]. After a brief time of brewing he became disturbed by the effects of his product on its consumers, and closed down the distillery. He even went so far as to address the [[Hamilton County, Ohio| Hamilton County]] Agricultural Board in 1831, claiming that he had sinned in creating the whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and also stop producing liquors.<ref>Burr, p. 258</ref>

His private life only lasted a few years. He returned to public life and the national stage in 1836, when he made an unsuccessful run for the presidency as the [[Whig]] candidate.<ref>Burr, p. 258</ref>

===1836 presidential campaign===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1836}}

Harrison was the Northern [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] candidate for President in 1836. The election was the only time in American history when a major political party intentionally ran more than one presidential candidate. [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Martin Van Buren]], the Democratic Candidate, was popular and likely to win the election against an individual Whig candidate. The goal was to elect popular Whigs regionally, deny Van Buren a majority of the votes, and then have the House of Representatives, which the Whigs controlled, decide the election.<ref name = oc>{{cite web |title=U.S. President - Whig Nominees 1836 |work=OurCampaigns.com |url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=65035 |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>

Harrison was nominated to lead the Whig ticket in most of the states. [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]],  and [[Hugh L. White]] were put as the Whig candidate in Kentucky, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Maryland. The plan backfired on the Whigs and Van Buren won the election by 51% to 49%.<ref name = oc/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/scores.html#1836|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2008-06-20|title=Historical Election Results}}</ref>

===1840 presidential campaign===
{{main|United States presidential election, 1840}}

Harrison was the candidate again (and again faced Van Buren, now the incumbent President) in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1840|1840 election]]. The Whig party now unified behind a single candidate, and Harrison was chosen over the more controversial members of the party, such as Clay and Webster. Harrison based his campaign heavily on his heroic military record and on the weak U.S. economy, brought about by the [[Panic of 1837]]. In a ploy to blame Van Buren for the depressed economy, they nicknamed him "Van Ruin".<ref>Carnes, p. 39</ref>

The Democrats attempted to ridicule Harrison by calling him "Granny Harrison, the petticoat general", because he resigned from the army before the [[War of 1812]] ended. When asking voters whether Harrison should be elected, they asked them what his name backwards was, which happens to be "No Sirrah." Democrats also cast Harrison as a provincial, out-of-touch old man who would rather "sit in his log cabin drinking hard cider" than attend to the administration of the country. This strategy backfired, however, when Harrison and his Vice Presidential running-mate, [[John Tyler]], immediately adopted the log cabin and hard cider symbols, using the images in banners, posters, and creating bottles of hard cider that were shaped like log cabins.<ref>Carnes, p. 39-40</ref>

[[Image:WmHHarrison-poster.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Poster of Harrison's accomplishments.]]

Their campaign was from then on marked by exaggeration of Harrison's connections to the common man. Harrison came from an aristocratic Virginia family, but his supporters promoted him as a humble frontiersman, in the style of the popular [[Andrew Jackson]]. A memorable example of these efforts was the [[Gold Spoon Oration]], delivered by a Whig congressman. Van Buren, by contrast, was presented as a wealthy elitist who spent taxpayers' money on champagne and on crystal goblets from which to sip it.<ref>Carnes, p. 40</ref>

An old Whig chant from the time of the election played up on this difference between candidates:

<blockquote>
''Old Tip he wore a home-spun coat, he had no ruffled shirt-wirt-wirt,''<br>
''Old Matt he has the golden plate, and he's a little squirt-wirt-wirt!''
</blockquote>

People singing the chant were supposed to spit tobacco juice while singing the "wirt-wirt" parts.<ref>Carnes, p. 41</ref>

The Whigs also played up Harrison's military record and reputation as the hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe. Their campaign slogan, "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too", became one of the most famous in American politics.<ref>Carnes, p. 41</ref> On election day, Harrison won a [[landslide victory#United States|landslide electoral college victory]], though the popular vote was much closer, at 53% to 47%<ref>Carnes, p. 41</ref>

==Presidency 1841==
===Shortest presidency=== 
When Harrison arrived in Washington, he focused on showing that he was still the steadfast hero of [[Battle of Tippecanoe|Tippecanoe]]. He took the oath of office on [[March 4]], [[1841]], an extremely cold and wet day. Nevertheless, he faced the weather without his overcoat and delivered the longest [[inaugural address]] in American history. At 8,444 words, it took nearly two hours to read (even after his friend and fellow Whig, [[Daniel Webster]], had edited it for length). He then rode through the streets in the inaugural parade.<ref name = loc>{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr072.html |title=Harrison's Inauguration (Reason): American Treasures of the Library of Congress|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref> 

Most of his business during Harrison's month-long presidency involved heavy social obligations <U+2013> an inevitable part of his high position and arrival in Washington <U+2013> and receiving visitors who were seeking his favor in the hope that he would appoint them to the numerous offices the President then had at his disposal. Harrison and Clay had also disagreed about government [[patronage]], which was entirely given at the discretion of the President. Harrison had tried to end the dispute by promising in his inaugural address not to use the power to enhance his own standing in the government; however, the fact of his accession to power had scores of people lining up at the doors of the [[White House]].<ref name = loc/>

Harrison's only act of consequence as President was to call Congress into a special session, which he set to begin on [[May 31]], [[1841]]. He and Whig leader [[Henry Clay]] had disagreed over the necessity of the special session (which Harrison opposed, but Clay desired in order to get his economic agenda underway immediately), but Clay's powerful position in both the legislature and the Whig Party quickly forced Harrison to give in. He thus proclaimed the special session in the interests of "the condition of the revenue and finance of the country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentprofiles.com/Washington-Johnson/Harrison-William-Henry-and-Tyler-John.html |title=William Henry Harrison and John Tyler|publisher=presidentprofiles.com|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

[[Image:Harrison tomb.JPG|220px|thumb|right|[[William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial (North Bend, Ohio)|Harrison's tomb]] and memorial in [[North Bend, Ohio]].]]

On [[March 26]], Harrison became ill with a [[common cold|cold]]. The presumptive story, which has become common knowledge despite its falsity, is that the inauguration day exposure was the cause of his illness. In fact, it was more than three weeks after the inauguration before Harrison showed the first signs ill health. The cold worsened after he was caught in a rain shower, rapidly turning to [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]].<ref>Cleaves, p. 152</ref> According to the prevailing medical misconception of that time, microorganisms being then unknown, it was believed that his illness was directly caused by the bad weather, when, in fact, he was likely a victim of the [[common cold]] [[virus]], exacerbated by the drastic pressures of his changed circumstances. He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers; in addition, his extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.<ref name = loc/>

Harrison's doctors tried cures, applying [[opium]], [[castor oil]], [[Virginia snakeweed]], and even actual [[snakes]]. But the treatments only made Harrison worse, and he became delirious. He died nine days after becoming ill,<ref>Cleaves, p. 160</ref> at 12:30 a.m., on [[April 4]], [[1841]], of right lower lobe [[pneumonia]], [[jaundice]], and overwhelming [[septicemia]], becoming the first American President to die in office. His last words were to his doctor, but assumed to be to John Tyler, "Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more." Harrison served the shortest term of any American President: only 30&nbsp;days, 12&nbsp;hours and 30&nbsp;minutes.<ref name = loc/>

Harrison's funeral took place in the [[Wesley Chapel (Cincinnati)|Wesley Chapel]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio in 1841. He was a founding member of [[Christ Church Cathedral, Cincinnati|Christ Church]], Cincinnati. He was buried in [[North Bend, Ohio]] at the [[William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial (North Bend, Ohio)|William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohsweb.ohiohistory.org/places/sw11/|publisher= Ohio Historical Society|title=Harrison Tomb|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

[[Harrison County, Indiana]]; [[Harrison County, Mississippi]]; [[Harrison County, Iowa]]; [[Harrison County, Ohio]]; and [[William Henry Harrison High School]] are all named in honor of Harrison. He was the first, but not only, U.S. President to have no military vessel named after him. However, during the [[American Civil War]], the [[Union Army]] named a post near [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] "[[Camp Harrison]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=665 |title=Camp Harrison|publisher= Ohio History Central|date=July 1, 2005| accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref> 

The untimely death of Harrison was a disappointment to [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], who hoped to pass a revenue tariff and enact measures to support [[Henry Clay|Henry Clay's]] [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]. [[John Tyler]], Harrison's successor and a former Democrat, abandoned the Whig agenda, leaving himself without a party.<ref name = tyler>{{cite web|chapter=The Accidental President| title=John Tyler, Tenth Vice President (1841)| url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_John_Tyler.htm| publisher=senate.gov|accessdate=2008-06-18}}</ref>

The death of Harrison caused three Presidents to serve in a single calendar year. This has only happened twice in history. The second time was in 1881, when [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] relinquished the office to [[James A. Garfield]], who was assassinated later in that year. With the death of Garfield, [[Chester A. Arthur]] stepped into the Presidency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/uspresidents/a/tecumseh.htm |title=''Tecumseh's Curse and the US Presidents: Coincidence or Something More?|author=Martin Kelly|accessdate=2008-06-09}}</ref>

Harrison was the first President to die in office, and his death revealed the flaws in the constitution's clauses on presidential succession. Although the constitution said the Vice President would take charge after the death of the President, there was no provision clarifying whether the Vice President would become President, or merely Acting-President. Another problem was that the constitution did not stipulate whether the Vice President could serve the remainder of the President's term, until the next election, or if emergency elections should be held. Harrison's cabinet insisted that Tyler was "Vice President acting as President". After the cabinet consulted with the [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger Taney]] they decided that if Tyler took the presidential [[Oath of Office]] he could become President in fact. Tyler obliged and was sworn in on [[April 6]]. In May, Congress convened, and after a short period of debate in both houses a resolution was passed that confirmed Tyler in the Presidency for the remainder of Harrison's term. Once established, this precedent of presidential succession remained in effect until [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-fifth amendment]] was passed in 1963.<ref name = tyler/>  The 1963 amendment dealt with the finer points of succession by clearly defining in what situations the Vice President was Acting President and in what situation he could become President.
