'''Malik Ambar''' (1549<U+2013>1626) was an [[Ethiopia]]n born in [[Harar]], sold as a child by his parents due to poverty who would eventually come to rule large portions of India. He eventually arrived in [[India]], where he was educated and given opportunities, but he remained a slave. Nevertheless in time he created an independent army that had up to 1500 men. This army resided in the [[Deccan]] region and was hired by many local kings. He also founded the city of [[Aurangabad Maharashtra]][http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011272] on the site of a previous village. He eventually rose to become a very popular Prime Minister of [[Ahmadnagar]], showing his administrative acumen in various fields. Malik is also regarded as a pioneer in Guerilla warfare in the Deccan region. He is credited with having carried out a systematic revenue settlement of major portions of the Deccan, which formed the basis for many subsequent settlements. He died in 1626. He is a figure of veneration to the [[Siddi]]s of [[Gujarat]].He humbled the might of the Mughals and Adil Shah of Bijapur and raised the falling status of the Nizam Shah.

==Early life==

Malik Ambar was born in the city of Alhura in a Habshi tribe of Maya, the capital of the dying [[Adal Sultanate]], in modern eastern Ethiopia. Both Ethiopia and the rebellious (formerly vassal) Adal sultanate were devastated after two decades of war with each other. According to the ''Futuhat-i `adil Shahi'', Malik Ambar then known as Shambhu or Shan-bu was sold into slavery by his parents. He ended up in [[Mocha, Yemen|al-Mukha]] in [[Yemen]], where he was sold again for 20 ducats and was taken to the slave market in [[Baghdad]], where he was sold a third time to the [[Qadi|Qadi al-Qudat]] of [[Mecca]] and again in Baghdad to Mir Qasim al-Baghdadi, who eventually took him to  [[Deccan Plateau|south-central India]].

Racist Dutch always tried to colonize even by using European descriptions of Ethiopian King Malik Anbar.

==His career==

Malik Ambar was the regent of the Nizamshahi dynasty of [[Ahmednagar]] from 1607 to 1626.  During this period he increased the strength and power of Murtaza Nizam Shah and raised a large army. He changed the capital from Paranda to Junar and founded a new city, Khadki which was later on changed to [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] by the Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] when he invaded the Deccan (1658 to 1707). Malik Ambar cherished strong love and ability for architecture. Aurangabad was Ambar's architectural achievement and creation. Malik Ambar the founder of the city was always referred to by harsh names by Emperor [[Jahangir]]. In his memoirs he never mentions his name without prefixing epithets like wretch, cursed fellow, Habshi, Ambar Siyari, black Ambar, and Ambar Badakhtur. Some historians believe that those words came out of frustration as Malik Ambar had resisted the powerful Mughals and kept them away from Deccan.

===Pioneer of guerilla warfare===
[[image:Copy_of_12062009755.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Article on Malik Ambar, published in July 1999]]
Malik Ambar is said to be the pioneer of guerilla warfare in the Deccan region. He had mobilized the Marathas who were then farmers, trained them in guerilla warfare. Malik Ambar trained the Marathas and tranformed them into excellent riders, warriors, and masters of surprise attacks on the enemy. This helped Malik Ambar gain a reputation as one general who had never lost a battle. Shahji Bhonsle who was in the servitude in the court of the Sultan assisted him greatly in assembling and training the mobile units of Marathas. Malik Ambar assisted [[Shah Jahan]] wrestle power in Delhi from his stepmother, [[Nur Jahan]], who had ambitions of seating her son-in-law on the throne. Maratha fighters were also used for this purpose. Malik Ambar and Shahji had also restored some credibility to the Sultans of Ahmadnagar, who had been subdued by the earlier Mughals (Akbar had annexed Ahmadnagar).[http://www.boloji.com/history/020.htm/boloji.com]

===Malik Ambar designs the neher system===

Malik Amber is especially famous for the Neher, the water system, the rendering of which to this day is a miracle. His plan for the Nehar was met with sarcasm and ridicule. Vazir Mullah Mohammad declared it as a preposterous fancy which would require 'Um-Re-Noh' (Noh<U+2019>s life span), 'Sab-Re-Ayub' ( Ayub<U+2019>s patience), 'Khazana-Kharun' ( Kharun<U+2019>s treasure). But Malik Ambar completed the Neher within fifteen months, spending a nominal of sum of two and a half lakhs. This city is situated on the banks of river Kham, a small perennial stream which takes it<U+2019>s rise in the neighbouring hill. "<ref>Qureshi Dulari,''"Tourism Potential in Aurangabad,"'' p.7</ref>

== Conflict with Mughals==
Malik Amber thrust defeats on the Mughal General Khan Khanan many times and attacked Ahmadnagar often. Lakhuji Jdhavrao, Maloji Bhosale, Shahaji Bhosale and other Maratha chiefs had gained great prominence during this period. With the help of these Maratha Chiefs, Malik Ambar had captured [[Ahmednagar Fort]] and town from the Mughals. But in one of the battles Malik Ambar was defeated by the Mughals and had to lose the fort of Ahmadnagar. Many Maratha Chiefs and especially Lakhuji Jadhavrao joined the Mughals. [[Shah Jahan]] once again laid a crushing blow to Malik Ambar in one of the battles and further decreased his power. Malik Ambar was a great statesman and soldier. He humbled the might of the Mughal and Adil Shah of Bijapur and raised the falling status of the Nizam Shah.  Though defeated by the Mughals he was never cowed down by their might.

==Death==
He died in 1626 at the age of 80 (eighty).Malik Ambar had two sons, Fatteh Khan and Changiz Khan. Fatteh Khan succeeded  his father as the regent of Mizam Shah.

==Comments of Historians==
A noted historian Dr. Beni Prasad notes: ''The chief importance of the Deccan campaigns of the Mughals lies in the opportunities of military training and political power which they afforded to the Marathas. Malik Ambar, who was a great master of the art of guerilla warfare as Shivaji himself, stands as the head of the builders of the Maratha nationality. His primary object was to serve the interest of his own master, but unconsciously he nourished into strength a power which more than avenged the injuries of the South on the Northern power.''

== Foundation of Aurangabad==
He founded/inhabited Aurangabad  on the site of the Khirki/Khadke("Big Rock") village in 1610. After his death in 1626, the name was change to Fatehpur by his son Fatehkhan. When Aurangzeb, the mughal emperor invaded Deccan in the year 1653, he made Fatehpur his capital and renamed it as Aurangabad. Since then it is known as Aurangabad. Two capital cities Viz. <U+2018>Pratisthan<U+2019> (Paithan) i.e. the capital of Satvahanas (2nd B. C. to 3rd A. D.) and Devagiri (Daulatabad) the capital of Yadavas are located within the limits of Aurangabad. Aurangabad is known for the world famous caves at Ellora and Ajantha, the Jyotirlinga of Ghrishneshwar, and the Sant Dnyaneshwar udyan near the Nathsagar dam at Jayakwadi.
