[[Image:WilliamOfOrange1580.jpg|thumb|right|'''William I''' (William the Silent)]]'''William I of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange]]-[[Nassau (state)|Nassau]]''' ([[April 24]], [[1533]] &ndash; [[July 10]], [[1584]]), also widely known as '''William the Silent''' [Dutch: ''Willem de Zwijger''], was born in the [[House of Nassau]], and became [[Prince of Orange]] in [[1544]]. He was the main leader of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] revolt against the [[Spain|Spanish]] that set off the [[Eighty Years' War]] and resulted in the formal independence of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in [[1648]]. 

A wealthy [[nobility|nobleman]], William originally served at the court of the Spanish [[regent]]. Unhappy with the lack of [[political power]] for the local nobility and the Spanish persecution of Dutch [[Protestantism|Protestants]], William joined the Dutch uprising and turned against his former masters. The most influential and politically capable of the rebels, he led the Dutch to several military successes in the fight against the Spanish. Declared an [[outlaw]] by the Spanish king in [[1580]], he was [[assassinated]] by [[Balthasar G<U+00E9>rard]] (also written as 'Gerardts') in [[Delft]] at a time when William's popularity was waning.

There are several explanations for the origin of this [[nickname]] "William the Silent". The most common one is that he rarely spoke out clearly on controversial matters at the court or in public, or (by some accounts) even completely avoided speaking about such topics. 

In the Netherlands, he is also known as the ''Vader des vaderlands'', "Father of the fatherland", and the Dutch [[national anthem]], the [[Wilhelmus]], was written in his honour. 

On [[April 13]], [[2005]], [http://www.inghist.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/WVO an online searchable archive] of his complete (known) correspondence was made publicly accessible by ''Het Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis (ING)'', the Institute for Dutch History.

== Early life ==
[[Image:WilliamOfOrange1555.jpg|thumb|right|A picture of William of Orange in his years at the court in Brussels.]]

William was born in the castle of [[Dillenburg]] in [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]], present-day [[Germany]]. He was the eldest son of [[William the Rich|William, Count of Nassau]] and [[Juliana of Stolberg|Juliana of Stolberg-Werningerode]], and was raised a [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]]. He had four younger brothers and seven younger sisters: [[Johan of Nassau|John]], Hermanna, [[Louis of Nassau|Louis]], [[Mary of Nassau|Mary]], Anna, Elisabeth, Katharine, Juliane, Magdalene, [[Adolf of Nassau|Adolf]] and [[Henry of Nassau|Henry]].

When his cousin, [[Ren<U+00E9> of Ch<U+00E2>lon]], Prince of Orange, died childless in 1544, the eleven-year-old William inherited all Ch<U+00E2>lon's property, including the title Prince of Orange. Because of his young age, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] served as the regent of the principality until William was fit to rule. However, Charles V demanded that William receive a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] education. William was sent to [[Brussels]] to study under the supervision of [[Maria of Austria|Maria of Austria]], the sister of Charles V and [[Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|regent of the Habsburg Netherlands]] ([[Seventeen Provinces]]). In Brussels, he was taught foreign languages and received military and diplomatic education. 

On [[6 July]] [[1551]], he married [[Anna van Egmond|Anna van Egmond en Buren]], the wealthy heir to the lands of her father, and William earned the titles Lord of Egmond and Count of Buren. They had three children: 
#Maria (1553 &ndash; 1554);
#[[Philip William of Orange|Philip-William]] (1554 &ndash; 1618); and
#[[Maria of Nassau|Maria]] (1556 &ndash; 1616).<br>
 
Later that same year, William was appointed [[captain]] in the [[cavalry]]. Favoured by Charles V, he made quick promotions, and became commander of one of the Emperor's armies at age 22. He was made a member of the [[Raad van State]], the highest political advisory council in the Netherlands[[William I of Orange#Notes|<sup>1</sup>]] in 1555; the same year Charles abdicated in favour of his son, [[Philip II of Spain]].

His wife Anna died on [[24 March]] [[1558]]. Later, William of Orange had a brief relationship with Eva Eliver but the two never married. He fathered an [[illegitimate]] son, Justines. In 1559, Philip appointed William as the [[stadtholder]] (governor) of the provinces [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Burgundy]], thereby greatly increasing his political power.

== From politician to rebel ==
[[Image:BattleOfHeiligerlee.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Battle of Heiligerlee]], fought on [[23 May]] [[1568]], is usually given as the beginning of the [[Eighty Years' War]].]]

Although he never directly opposed the Spanish king, William soon became one of the most prominent members of the opposition in the Raad van State, together with [[Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn|Philip de Montmorency, Count of Horn]] and [[Count of Egmont|Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]. They were mainly seeking for more political power for the Dutch nobility, and complained that too many Spaniards were involved in governing the Netherlands. 

William was also dissatisfied with the increasing persecution of [[Protestant Church|Protestants]] in the Netherlands. Brought up as both a Lutheran and later a Catholic, William was very religious but still was a proponent of freedom of religion for all people.  The [[inquisition]] policy in the Netherlands, carried out by [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Cardinal Granvelle]], prime minister to the new [[Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|regent]] Margaret of Parma (1522-1583)[[Margaret of Parma]] (natural half-sister to Philip II), increased opposition to the Spanish rule among the &ndash; then mostly Catholic &ndash; population of the Netherlands.

On [[25 August]] [[1561]], William of Orange married for the second time. His new wife, [[Anna of Saxony]], is described by contemporaries as "ugly and ill-tempered", and it is generally assumed that William married her to gain  more influence in [[Saxony]], [[Hesse]] and the [[Palatine]]. The couple had five children: 
#Anna (1562); 
#Anna (1563 &ndash; 1588); 
#Maurice August Philip (1564 &ndash; 1566);
#[[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] (1567 &ndash; 1625); and
#Emilia (1569 &ndash; 1629).

In early [[1565]], a large group of lesser noblemen, including William's younger brother [[Louis of Nassau|Louis]], formed the Confederacy of Noblemen. On [[5 April]], they offered a petition to Margaret of Austria, requesting an end to the persecution of Protestants. From August to October [[1566]], a wave of [[iconoclasm]] (known as the ''Beeldenstorm'') spread through the Low Countries. [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], angry with their being persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church and opposed to the Catholic images of saints (which in their eyes conflicted with the [[Ten Commandments|Second Commandment]]), destroyed statues in hundreds of [[church]]es and [[monastery|monasteries]] throughout the Netherlands. 

Following the Beeldenstorm, unrest in the Netherlands grew, and Margaret agreed to grant the wishes of the Confederacy, provided the noblemen would help to restore order. She also allowed more important noblemen, including William of Orange, to assist the Confederacy. In late 1566, and early 1567, it became clear that the regent would not be allowed to fulfill her promises, and when several minor rebellions failed, many [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] (the major Protestant denomination) and [[Lutheran]]s fled the country. Following the announcement that Philip II, unhappy with the situation in the Netherlands, would dispatch his loyal general [[Fernando <U+00C1>lvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba]] (also known as "The Iron Duke") to restore order, William retreated to his native Nassau. He had been (financially) involved with several of the rebels.

After his arrival in August 1567, Alba established the ''Council of Troubles'' (known to the people as the ''Council of Blood'') to judge those involved with the rebellion and the iconoclasm. William was one of the 10,000 to be summoned before the Council, but he failed to appear. He was subsequently declared an outlaw, and his properties were confiscated. 

As one of the most prominent and popular politicians of the Netherlands, William of Orange emerged as the leader of an armed resistance. He financed the ''[[Geuzen|Watergeuzen]]'', refugee Protestants who formed bands of [[Privateer|corsairs]] and raided the coastal cities of the Netherlands (often killing Spanish and Dutch alike). He also raised an army, consisting mostly of German [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to fight Alba on land. Led by his brother Louis, the army invaded the northern Netherlands in [[1568]]. On [[23 May]], the army won the [[Battle of Heiligerlee]] against a Spanish army led by the stadtholder of the northern provinces, [[Jean de Ligne, Duke of Aremberg]]. Aremberg was killed in the battle, as was William's brother Adolf. Alba countered by killing a number of convicted noblemen (including the Dukes of Egmont and Hoorn on [[6 June]]), and then by leading an expedition to [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. There, he annihilated Louis's forces in the [[Battle of Jemmingen]] on [[21 July]], although Louis managed to escape. These two battles are now considered to be the start of the Eighty Years' War.

== War ==
[[Image:Prinsenvlag.svg|thumbnail|250px|right|The so-called ''Prinsenvlag'' (Prince's flag), based on the colours in the [[coat of arms]] of William of Orange was used by the Dutch rebels, and forms the basis of the current [[flag of the Netherlands]].]]

William responded by leading a large army into [[Brabant]], but Alba carefully avoided a confrontation, expecting the army to fall apart quickly. He proved to be right, as William lacked the money to support the army. William made several more plans to invade in the next few years, but little came of it, lacking support and money. He remained popular with the public, partially through an extensive [[propaganda]] campaign through pamphlets. One of his most important claims, with which he attempted to justify his actions, was that he was not fighting the rightful owner of the land, the Spanish king, but only the inadequate rule of the foreign regents in the Netherlands, and the presence of foreign soldiers.

On [[1 April]], [[1572]] a band of Watergeuzen captured the city of [[Brielle]], which had been left unattended by the Spanish garrison. Contrary to their normal "hit and run" tactics, they occupied the town and claimed it for the prince. This event was followed by other cities in opening their gates for the Watergeuzen, and soon most cities in [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]] were in the hands of the rebels, notable exceptions being [[Amsterdam]] and [[Middelburg]]. The rebel cities then called a meeting of the [[Staten Generaal]] (which they were technically unqualified to do), and reinstated William as the stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland.

Concurrently, rebel armies captured cities throughout the entire country, from [[Deventer]] to [[Mons]]. William himself then advanced with his own army and marched into several cities in the south, including [[Roermond]] and [[Leuven]]. William had counted on intervention from the French Protestants ([[Huguenots]]) as well, but this plan was thwarted after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] on [[24 August]], which signalled the start of a wave of violence against the Huguenots. After a successful Spanish attack on his army, William had to flee and he retreated to [[Enkhuizen]], in Holland. The Spanish then organised countermeasures, and sacked several rebel cities, sometimes massacring their inhabitants, such as in [[Mechelen]] or [[Zutphen]]. They had more trouble with the cities in Holland, where they [[Siege of Haarlem | took Haarlem]] after seven months and a loss of 8,000 soldiers, and they had to give up their [[siege]] of [[Alkmaar]].

In [[1574]], William's armies won several minor battles, including several naval encounters. The Spanish, now lead by Don [[Luis de Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga y Requesens]] who succeeded Alva in 1573, also had their successes, and their decisive victory in the [[Battle of Mookerheyde]] on [[14 April]] cost the lives of two of William's brothers, Louis and Henry. Requesens's armies also besieged the city of [[Leiden]]. They broke up their siege when nearby dykes were cut by the Dutch. William was very content with the victory, and established the [[University of Leiden]], the first university in the Northern Provinces.

William married for the third time on [[24 April]] [[1575]]. He had his previous marriage legally disbanded in 1571, on claims of insanity of his wife Anna. Charlotte de Bourbon-Monpensier, a former French [[nun]], was also popular with the public. Together, they had six daughters: 
#Louise Juliana (1576 &ndash; 1644), married to [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine]];
#Elisabeth (1577 &ndash; 1642), married to [[Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne, duc de Bouillon]];
#Catherina Belgica (1578 &ndash; 1648); married to Count Philipp Ludwig II of Hanau-Muenzenberg
#Charlotte Flandrina (1579 &ndash; 1640);
#Charlotte Brabantia (1580 &ndash; 1631); and 
#Amelia Antwerpiana (1581 &ndash; 1657). 

After failed peace negotiations in [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]] in 1575, the war lingered on. Things looked bright for the rebels when Don Requesens died unexpectedly in early 1576, and a large group of Spanish soldiers, not having received their salary in months, deserted. While the new regent, [[Don John of Austria]], arrived, William of Orange managed to have most of the provinces and cities sign the [[Pacification of Ghent]], in which they declared to fight for the expulsion of Spanish troops together. However, he failed to achieve unity in matters of religion. Catholic cities and provinces would not allow freedom for Calvinists, and vice versa.

When Don John signed the [[Perpetual Edict]] in February 1577, promising to comply with the conditions of the Pacification of Ghent, it seemed that the war had been decided in favour of the rebels. However, after Don John took the city of [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in 1577, the uprising spread throughout the entire Netherlands. Don John attempted to negotiate peace, but the prince intentionally let the negotiations fail. On [[24 September]] [[1577]], he made his triumphal entry in the capital Brussels. 

At the same time, Calvinist revolters grew more radical, and attempted to forbid Catholicism in their areas of control. William was opposed to this both for personal and political reasons. He desired freedom of religion, and he also needed the support of the less radical Protestants and Catholics to reach his political goals. On [[6 January]] [[1579]], several southern provinces, unhappy with William's radical following, sealed the [[Union of Arras|Treaty of Arras]], in which they agreed to accept their regent, [[Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza|Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma]] (who had succeeded Don John). 

Five northern provinces, later followed by most cities in [[Brabant]] and [[Flanders]], then signed the [[Union of Utrecht]] on [[23 January]], confirming their unity. William was initially opposed to the Union, as he still hoped to unite all provinces. Nevertheless, he formally gave his support on [[3 May]]. The Union of Utrecht would later become a ''de facto'' [[constitution]], and would remain the only formal connection between the Dutch provinces until [[1795]].

== Declaration of independence ==
[[Image:Nicholas Hilliard 002.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Fran<U+00E7>ois, Duke of Anjou|Duke of Anjou]], who had been attracted by William as the new sovereign of the Netherlands, was hugely unpopular with the public.]]

In spite of the renewed union, the Duke of Parma was successful in reconquering most of the southern part of the Netherlands. Because he had agreed to remove the Spanish troops from the provinces under the Treaty of Arras, and because Philip II needed them in Spain's war with Portugal, the Duke of Parma was unable to advance any further until the end of 1581. 

In the mean time, William and his supporters were looking for foreign support. The prince had already sought for French assistance on several occasions, and this time he managed to gain the support of [[Fran<U+00E7>ois, Duke of Anjou]], brother of king [[Henry III of France]]. On [[29 September]] [[1580]], the Staten Generaal (with the exception of Zeeland and Holland) signed the [[Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours]] with the Duke of Anjou. The Duke would gain the title "Protector of the Liberty of the Netherlands" and become the new sovereign. This, however, required that the Staten Generaal and William would let go of their formal support of the King of Spain, which they had maintained officially up to that moment.

On [[22 July]] [[1581]], the Staten Generaal declared their decision to no longer recognise Philip II as their king, in the [[Oath of Abjuration]]. This formal [[declaration of independence]] enabled the Duke of Anjou to come to the aid of the resisters. He did not arrive until [[10 February]] [[1582]], when he was officially welcomed by William in [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]]. 

On [[March 18]], the Spaniard [[Juan de J<U+00E1>uregui]] attempted to assassinate William in [[Antwerp]]. Although William suffered severe injuries, he survived thanks to the care of his wife Charlotte and his sister Mary. While William slowly recovered, the intensive care by Charlotte took its toll, and she died on [[5 May]]. 

The Duke of Anjou was not very popular with the population. In their view, the French were enemies, and the Duke of Anjou was not very concerned with the people's religious issues. The Duke was even accused of planning J<U+00E1>uregui's failed attempt to kill the prince. The provinces of Zeeland and Holland refused to recognise him as their sovereign, and William was widely criticised for what were called his "French politics". When the Anjou's French troops arrived in late 1582, William's plan seemed to pay off, as even the Duke of Parma feared that the Dutch would now gain the upper hand.

However, the Duke of Anjou himself was displeased with his limited power, and decided to take the city of [[Antwerp]] by force on [[18 January]] [[1583]]. The citizens, who were warned in time, defended their city in what is known as the "[[French Fury]]". The position of Anjou after this attack became impossible to hold, and he eventually left the country in June. His leave also discredited William, who nevertheless maintained his support for Anjou. He stood virtually alone on this issue, and became politically isolated. Holland and Zeeland nevertheless maintained him as their stadtholder, and attempted to declare him count of Holland and Zeeland, thus making him the official sovereign.

In the middle of all this, William had married for the fourth and final time on [[12 April]] [[1583]] to [[Louise de Colligny]], a French Huguenot and daughter of [[Gaspard de Coligny]]. She would be the mother of [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]] (1584 &ndash; 1647), William's fourth legitimate son.

== Assassination ==
[[Image:Moordwillemzwijger2.jpg|thumb|right|William the Silent was killed at his home by Balthasar G<U+00E9>rard on [[July 10]], [[1584]].]]
[[Image:StampWilliamOfOrange.jpg|thumb|right|A 1984 Dutch [[postage stamp]] commemorating the [[quatercentenary]] of William's death.]]

The Catholic Frenchman [[Balthasar G<U+00E9>rard]] (born 1557) was a supporter of Philip II, and in his opinion, William of Orange had betrayed the Spanish king and the Catholic religion. After Philip II declared William an outlaw and promised, which G<U+00E9>rard found out in 1581, he decided to travel to the Netherlands and kill him. He served in the army of the governor of [[Luxembourg]], [[Peter, Count of Mansfelt]] for two years, hoping to get close to William when the armies would meet. This never happened, and G<U+00E9>rard left the army in 1584. 

He went to the Duke of Parma to present his plans, but the Duke was unimpressed. In May 1584, he presented himself to William as a French nobleman, and gave him the seal of the Count of Mansfelt. This seal would allow for forgeries of message of Mansfelt. William sent G<U+00E9>rard back to [[France]] to pass the seal to his French allies.

G<U+00E9>rard returned in July, having bought pistols on his return voyage. On [[10 July]], he made an appointment with William of Orange in his home in [[Delft]], nowadays known as the ''Prinsenhof''. When he left the dining room and climbed down the stairs, G<U+00E9>rard shot him in the chest from close range, and fled. According to the official account [http://www.onsverleden.net/nederlandseopstand/stvanhollandmoordwvo.htm], William's last words were (in French):

: "Mon Dieu, mon Dieu, ayez piti<U+00E9> de moi et de ton pauvre peuple" (My Lord, My Lord, have pity on me and your poor people)

Members of the Nassau family were traditionally buried in [[Breda (Netherlands)|Breda]], but as that city was in Spanish hands when William died, he was buried in the New Church (''Nieuwe Kerk'') in [[Delft]]. His grave monument was originally very sober, but it was replaced in [[1623]] by a splendid new one, made by [[Hendrik de Keyser]] and his son Pieter. Since then, most of the members of the [[Prince of Orange|House of Orange]], including all [[Dutch monarchy|Dutch monarchs]] have been buried in the same church.
William the third, King of England and Scotland and Stadholder in the Netherlands was burried in Westminster Anney

G<U+00E9>rard was caught before he could flee Delft, and imprisoned. He was tortured before his trial on [[13 July]], where he was sentenced to be brutally&mdash;even by the standards of that time&mdash;killed. The magistrates sentenced that the right hand of G<U+00E9>rard should be burned off with a red-hot iron, that his flesh should be torn from his bones with pincers in six different places, that he should be quartered and disemboweled alive, that his heart should be torn from his bosom and flung in his face, and that, finally, his head should be taken off.

== Legacy ==
[[Image:Willem van Oranje Standbeeld Den Haag, juni 2003.JPG|thumb|right|A statue of William of Orange in [[The Hague]]. His finger originally pointed towards the [[Binnenhof]], but the statue has since been moved. A [[:Image:William of Orange Rutgers.jpg|similar statue]] stands in Voorhees Mall on the campus of [[Rutgers University]]]]

At the suggestion of [[Johan van Oldenbarneveldt]], William's son [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice]] succeeded his father as stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland. A strong military leader, he won several victories over the Spanish. Van Oldenbarneveldt managed to sign a very favourable 12-year armistice in [[1609]], although Maurice was unhappy with this. After the armistice, Maurice's half-brother (and William's youngest son), [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry]], continued the battle against the Spanish. The Netherlands became formally independent after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in [[1648]]. 

The son of Frederick Henry, [[William II of Orange]] succeeded his father as stadtholder, as did his son, [[William III of Orange]]. The latter also became king of England until he died childless in [[1702]]. He appointed his nephew (a great-great-grandson of William of Orange's brother John) Johan Willem Friso as his successor. Because Albertine Agnes, a daughter of Frederick Henry married William Frederik of Nassau-Dietz the kings of the Netherlands, descent of William the Silent through the femile line. See [[House of Orange]] for a more extensive overview.

As the chief financer and political and military leader of the early years of the Dutch revolt, William is considered a national hero in the Netherlands, even though he was born in Germany, and usually spoke [[French language|French]]. Many of the Dutch national symbols can be traced back to William of Orange:

* The [[flag of the Netherlands]] (red, white and blue) is derived from the flag of the prince, which was orange, white and blue. 
* The [[coat of arms]] of the Netherlands is based on that of William of Orange. Its motto ''Je maintiendrai'' (French, "I will maintain") was also used by William of Orange, who based it on the motto of his cousin Ren<U+00E9> of Ch<U+00E2>lon, who used ''Je maintiendrai Ch<U+00E2>lon''.
* The [[national anthem]] of the Netherlands, the [[Wilhelmus]] was originally a propaganda song for William. It was probably written by [[Philips van Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde]], a supporter of William of Orange.
* The national colour of the Netherlands is [[orange (colour)|orange]], and it is used, among other things, in clothing of Dutch athletes.

== Notes ==
<sup>1</sup> As of 1549, the Netherlands, also known as the "Seventeen Provinces" was comprised of the present-day Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and parts of northern France.
