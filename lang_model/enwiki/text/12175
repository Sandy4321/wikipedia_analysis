{{Nihongo|'''''Kud Wafter'''''|<U+30AF><U+30C9><U+308F><U+3075><U+305F><U+30FC>|Kudo Wafut<U+0101>}} is a Japanese [[Eroge|adult]] [[visual novel]] developed by [[Key (company)|Key]] and was released on June 25, 2010 as a [[DVD]] playable on a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Personal computer|PC]]. The game is Key's eighth similar game in its history. Focusing on the title character [[List of Little Busters! characters#Kudryavka Noumi|Kudryavka Noumi]], also known as {{Nihongo|"Kud"|<U+30AF><U+30C9>|Kudo}} for short, the [[gameplay]] follows a plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction. The narrative details the lives of Riki Naoe and his close friend Kudryavka as they start to see more of each other in a romantic relationship.

''Kud Wafter'' is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of Key's earlier adult game ''[[Little Busters!|Little Busters! Ecstasy]]'', which itself is an expanded version of the original ''[[Little Busters!]]'' game rated for everyone. Kudryavka appears as a heroine in both ''Little Busters!'' and ''Ecstasy''. ''Kud Wafter'' is an expansion of Kudryavka's story after the events of ''Ecstasy'' and is written by Chika Shirokiri. [[Na-Ga]] and [[Itaru Hinoue]] returned as co-art directors. A [[manga]] adaptation illustrated by Bakutend<U+014D> began serialization in the May 2010 issue of [[ASCII Media Works]]' ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Kud Wafter screenshot.jpg|thumb|230px|left|An average conversation in ''Kud Wafter'' featuring the main character talking to Kudryavka.]]
''Kud Wafter'''s [[gameplay]] requires little interaction from the player as most of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears, representing either [[dialogue]] between the characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Often, players will come to a "decision point" where they are given the chance to choose from options displayed on the screen, typically two to three at a time. The time between these decision points is variable and during these times, gameplay pauses until a choice is made that furthers the plot in a specific direction. In order to view the available plot lines to their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different choices to further the plot in an alternate direction.<ref name="Kud-Wafter-VN">{{cite video game|title=Kud Wafter|developer=[[Key (company)|Key]]|publisher=[[Visual Art's]]|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]] [[Personal computer|PC]]|language=Japanese|date=June 25, 2010}}</ref> As gameplay progresses, the player will come across bonus [[Hentai|sex scenes]] depicting Riki and Kudryavka having intercourse.<ref name="spec"/>

However, the male dormitory is undergoing renovations due to a problem with the plumbing, leaving Riki without a place to stay.
