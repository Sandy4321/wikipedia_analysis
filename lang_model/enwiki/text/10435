<!-- Do not add "Sir", see above-->'''Edward Moore''' "'''Ted'''" '''Kennedy'''<!-- Do not add "KBE", see above--> (February 22, 1932{{ndash}} August 25, 2009) was a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]] and a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Serving almost 47 years, he was the [[List of United States Senators in the 111th Congress by seniority|second most senior]] member of the Senate when he died and is the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|fourth-longest-serving senator]] in United States history. For many years the most prominent living member of the [[Kennedy family]], he was the last surviving son of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]]; the youngest brother of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]], both victims of assassination, and [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], killed in action in World War II; and the father of Congressman [[Patrick J. Kennedy]].

Kennedy entered the Senate in a [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962|November 1962 special election]] to fill the seat once held by his brother John. He was elected to a full six-year term in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1964|1964]] and was reelected seven more times before his death. The controversial [[Chappaquiddick incident]] on July 18, 1969, resulted in the death of his automobile passenger [[Mary Jo Kopechne]]; Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident, and the incident significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming [[President of the United States]]. His one attempt, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]].

Kennedy was known for his charisma and oratorical skills. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his [[1980 Democratic National Convention|1980 rallying cry]] for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as "The Lion of the Senate" through his long tenure and influence. More than 300 bills that Kennedy and his staff wrote were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government emphasizing [[economic justice|economic]] and [[social justice]], but was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises between senators with disparate views. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including laws addressing [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|immigration]], [[National Cancer Act of 1971|cancer research]], [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|health insurance]], [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986|apartheid]], [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|disability discrimination]], [[Ryan White AIDS Care Act|AIDS care]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|civil rights]], [[Mental Health Parity Act|mental health benefits]], [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|children's health insurance]], [[No Child Left Behind Act|education]] and [[Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act|volunteering]]. In the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful [[immigration reform]] efforts. Over the course of his Senate career and continuing into the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], Kennedy continued his efforts to enact [[universal health care]], which he called the "cause of my life."

In May 2008, Kennedy was diagnosed with a [[malignant]] [[brain tumor]] which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died on August 25, 2009, in his [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]] [[Kennedy Compound|home]]. By the time of his death, he had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for [[American progressivism]].

===Chappaquiddick incident===
{{Main|Chappaquiddick incident}}
[[File:Mary Jo Kopechne.jpg|thumb|right|upright|115px|Mary Jo Kopechne]]
On the night of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was on [[Martha's Vineyard]]'s [[Chappaquiddick Island]] at a party he gave for the "[[Boiler Room Girls]]", a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's presidential campaign the year before.<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Kennedy left the party, driving a [[Oldsmobile Delmont 88#1965<U+2013>68|1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88]] with one of the women, 28-year-old [[Mary Jo Kopechne]], and later drove off Dike Bridge into the [[Poucha Pond]] inlet, a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.<ref name="bg-series-3"/>

On July 25, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a sentence of two months in jail, [[suspended sentence|suspended]].<ref name="bg-series-3"/> That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, "I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately," but denied driving under the influence of alcohol and denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne.<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office and, after getting a favorable response,{{clarify|date=December 2011}} he did so.<ref name="bg-series-3"/>

In January 1970, an inquest into Kopechne's death was held in [[Edgartown, Massachusetts]].<ref name="bg-series-3"/> At the request of Kennedy's lawyers, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ordered the inquest be conducted in secret.<ref name="bg-series-3"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Fighting for Air: In the Trenches With Television News|isbn=0826209521|year=1994|first=Liz|last=Trotta|location=Columbia, MO|publisher=University of Missouri Press}} p. 184</ref><ref name="bly_213">Bly, ''The Kennedy Men'', p. 213</ref>  The presiding judge, James A. Boyle, concluded that some aspects of Kennedy's story of that night were not true, and that negligent driving "appears to have contributed to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne".<ref name="bly_213"/> A [[grand jury]] on Martha's Vineyard conducted a two-day investigation in April 1970 but issued no indictment, after which Boyle made his inquest report public.<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Kennedy deemed its conclusions "not justified".<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Questions about the Chappaquiddick incident generated a large number of articles and books over the next several years.<ref name="cby-227"/>

[[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1970|Kennedy easily won re-election to another term]] in the Senate in 1970 with 62&nbsp;percent of the vote against underfunded Republican candidate Josiah Spaulding, although he received about 500,000 fewer votes than in 1964.<ref name="cby-227"/>

Chappaquiddick had greatly damaged Kennedy's future presidential prospects{{r|time19680801}} and he had declared, shortly after the incident, that he would not be a candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 U.S. presidential election]].<ref name="bg-series-3"/> Nevertheless, polls in 1971 suggested he could win the nomination if he tried, and Kennedy gave some thought to running.

===Fall and rise===
Kennedy's personal life came to dominate his image. In 1989 the European [[paparazzi]] stalked him on a vacation there and photographed him having sex on a motorboat.<ref name="bg-series-5"/> In February 1990, [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]] published his long, thorough profile "Ted Kennedy on the Rocks" in ''[[GQ]]'' magazine.<ref name="kelly">{{cite news | url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5585 | title=Ted Kennedy on the Rocks | author=Kelly, Michael | magazine=[[GQ]] | date=February 1990 | accessdate=April 19, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071101021225/http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5585 |archivedate = November 1, 2007 | authorlink= Michael Kelly (editor)}}</ref> It captured Kennedy as "an aging Irish boyo clutching a bottle and diddling a blonde," portrayed him as an out-of-control [[English Regency|Regency]] [[Rake (character)|rake]], and brought his behavior to the forefront of public attention.<ref name="kelly"/><ref name="bg-series-5"/><ref name="hersh-83"/>  The death from cancer of brother-in-law [[Stephen Edward Smith]] in August 1990 left Kennedy emotionally bereft at the loss of a close family member and troubleshooter.<ref name="bg-series-5"/><ref>Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 86<U+2013>88.</ref> Kennedy pushed on, but even his legislative successes, such as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], which expanded employee rights in discrimination cases, came at the cost of being criticized for compromising with Republicans and Southern Democrats.<ref name="time-10-best"/>

On [[Easter weekend]] 1991, Kennedy was at a get-together at the family's [[Palm Beach, Florida]] estate when, restless and maudlin after reminiscing about his brother-in-law, he left for a late-night visit to a local bar, getting his son [[Patrick J.

Along with Bork, the other most contentious Supreme Court nomination in United States history has been the one for [[Clarence Thomas]].<ref>Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 364.</ref>  [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|When the Thomas hearings began]] in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about ''[[Roe v.

Due to the Palm Beach media attention and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A [[Gallup Poll]] gave Kennedy a very low 22&nbsp;percent national approval rating.<ref name="bg-series-5"/>  A ''[[Boston Herald]]''/[[WCVB-TV]] poll found that 62&nbsp;percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for reelection, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy has misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor [[William Weld]] by 25&nbsp;points.<ref>Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', p. 98.</ref>
Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991 dinner party, Kennedy saw [[Victoria Reggie Kennedy|Victoria Anne Reggie]], a Washington lawyer at [[Keck, Mahin & Cate]], a divorced mother of two, and the daughter of an old Kennedy family ally, [[Louisiana]] judge [[Edmund Reggie]].<ref name="clymer-492">Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 492<U+2013>493.</ref>  They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship.<ref name="clymer-492"/>  In a late October speech at the [[John F.

[It] involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings <U+2014> the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them."<ref name="bg-series-5"/>  In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the [[O. J.

In the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], Kennedy campaigned heavily for fellow Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]].<ref name="bg-series-7"/> and lent his chief of staff, [[Mary Beth Cahill]], to the Kerry campaign.

==Political positions==
{{Main|Political positions of Ted Kennedy}}
Political scientists gauge [[ideology]] in part by comparing the annual ratings by the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) with the ratings by the [[American Conservative Union]] (ACU).<ref>{{cite news|author=Mayer, William|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28761-2004Mar27?language=printer|title=Kerry's Record Rings a Bell|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=August 24, 2008|date=March 28, 2004|quote=The question of how to measure a senator's or representative's ideology is one that political scientists regularly need to answer.

A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D.

''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the [[political spectrum]], in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005<U+2013>2006, Kennedy's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 91&nbsp;percent liberal and 0&nbsp;percent conservative, the social rating was 89&nbsp;percent liberal and 5&nbsp;percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 96&nbsp;percent liberal and 0&nbsp;percent conservative.<ref name="aap-08">Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 791.

Examination of two previous volumes of ''The Almanac of American Politics'' shows similar scores for 2001<U+2013>2002 and 1997<U+2013>1998.</ref>
