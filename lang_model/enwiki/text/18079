He was a first round draft pick of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in the [[2006 NHL Entry Draft]], and split time between the Maple Leafs and the [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) until he was traded to the Hurricanes in December 2009. Tlust<U+00FD> was also drafted by [[Atlant Moscow]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) on June 1, 2009, 43rd overall.

==Junior career==
Tlust<U+00FD> was assigned to the [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]], holders of his OHL rights. In Tlust<U+00FD>'s first 13 games of his OHL career, he sustained a bad high-ankle sprain that kept him out of the lineup for nearly 6 weeks as he attended treatment in [[Toronto]]. The injury also kept him from joining the Czech National team at the [[World Junior Hockey Championships]] although he was named to the pre-tournament roster. 

He made his return to the lineup in mid-January 2007. He finished his first regular season in the OHL with 13 goals, 21 assists for 34 points in 37 games. With Tlust<U+00FD> back in the lineup, the Greyhounds made a strong finish leading into the playoffs and scored an upset in the first round, eliminating the [[Saginaw Spirit]] in 6 games. In the next round they faced the [[London Knights]] and lost in 7 games. Tlust<U+00FD> played well in the playoffs scoring 9 goals and 8 assists for 17 points in 13 games.

He qualified for final cuts before being sent down to the AHL again. He played in 5 games in the AHL, scoring one goal and two assists.

On February 18, 2009, Ji<U+0159><U+00ED> Tlust<U+00FD> for the [[Toronto Marlies]] scored 5 goals on 5 shots against the [[Syracuse Crunch]], setting a franchise record for most goals scored in a game by one player for the [[Toronto Marlies]] and being the first player to score 5 goals in a game in the [[American Hockey League|AHL]] since [[Jarkko Immonen]] did it in 2006.

On March 4, 2009, Tlust<U+00FD> set a franchise record for most points in a game against the [[Providence Bruins]]. Tlust<U+00FD> finished with two goals and four assists for six points in a 6-4 victory for the [[Toronto Marlies]].

On January 15, 2009, Tlust<U+00FD> registered a career high of three points, all assists, in a game against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] .

==Nude photo incident==
<!--Please do not add links to nude images. They will be removed per the policy Wikipedia:Biographies of Living People.-->
In mid-November 2007, photos of Tlust<U+00FD>, one of which was of him nude, appeared on the [[Internet]], causing a media frenzy. Tlust<U+00FD> took the photos with his cell phone while still in Sault Ste. Marie the previous season. The photos of Tlust<U+00FD> first appeared on Canadian gossip site [http://isthishappening.com isthishappening.com], after which Tlust<U+00FD> retained the Toronto law firm Adair Morse, which began issuing cease and desist orders to some websites that had put the photos up.<ref>[http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2070/2034537760_63f74f94de_o.jpg (Image of C&D Order)]</ref> He issued a press release saying, "I used poor judgment in this instance and I have learned a valuable lesson." A second set of photos, reportedly taken during a night at a bar, was also circulating on the Internet. One photo showed Tlust<U+00FD> with his tongue out towards a male friend who was leaning in over his shoulder. This photo was published as the full-front page photo of the November 14, 2007 issue of the ''[[Toronto Sun]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.torontosun.com/FrontPage/2007/11/14/4654616.html | title=TorontoSun.com - Front Page - November 14: Cover |publisher = Toronto Sun | date = 2007-11-14 | accessdate = 2007-11-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Maple Leaf Rookie's Nude Pictures Show Up On Net | url = http://365gay.com/Newscon07/11/111407leaf.htm | publisher = ''[[365Gay.com]]'' |date = 2007-11-14 | accessdate = 2007-11-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071116125927/http://www.365gay.com/Newscon07/11/111407leaf.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-16}}</ref>
