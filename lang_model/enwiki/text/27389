'''''Weaver v. Palmer Brothers Co.''''', [[case citation|270 U.S. 402]] (1926), was a [[legal case|case]] decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that struck down a [[public health]] and safety regulation as a violation of [[due process]] under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>Varat, J.D. et. al.  ''Constitutional Law Cases and Materials, Concise Thirteenth Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2009, p. 368</ref>

==Decision==
A [[statute]] banned the use of cut up fabrics in the manufacturing of bedding based on concerns over public health.  The statute did allow for the use of other second hand fabrics after sterilization.  Because the banned cut up fabrics could be rendered safe by the same process of sterilization, the Court held the statute to be an arbitrary infringement on business that violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<ref>Varat, p. 368</ref>
