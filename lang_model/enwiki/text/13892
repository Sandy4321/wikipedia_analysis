'''Carlo Orelli''' (December 23, 1894 &ndash; January 22, 2005) was the last surviving [[Italy|Italian]] [[World War I]] veteran who joined the [[Italian Army|army]] at the onset of the war. Born in [[Perugia]], although he lived in [[Rome]] for most of his life, Orelli came from a military family whose members had served in various Italian conflicts since 1849. A mechanic by trade, Orelli joined the Italian Army in May 1915 and engaged in combat operations in Italy. His recollections were marked by particularly brutal experiences of trench warfare, including the violent deaths of many of his friends. After receiving injuries to his leg, he was pulled from active duty and returned home.

After recovering from a related infection, Orelli married and had a family of six children. During [[World War II]], despite his aversion to [[Nazi Germany]] and [[fascism]], he was forced to work as an artillery director in Italy. At war's end, he returned to work as a mechanic, retiring in 1960. In his later years, he was active in urging others not to forget the lessons learned after the first World War, and in 2003 he was made a Grand Officer in the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]. He died in January 2005, a month after having turned 110 and achieving [[supercentenarian]] status. At the time of his death he was Italy's oldest survivor of the First World War, the last remaining trench [[infantry]]man and the last survivor from Italy's entry into the war.

==Early life==
Orelli was born in [[Perugia]] on December 23, 1894, although his family soon moved to [[Rome]] to be nearer to an aunt that operated a local tavern.<ref name="Times">{{cite news|title = Carlo Orelli|work = Obituaries|publisher = The Times|date = 2005-02-03|url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article509722.ece|accessdate = 2007-12-20 | location=London}}</ref> Carlo came from a long history of military activity. His maternal grandfather, Thomas, helped defend Perugia against [[Austria]]n mercenaries in 1849, while Carlo's father served in the Italian [[Ethiopia|Abyssinian]] campaign during the [[Scramble for Africa]] in the 1880s. His elder brother Alfredo fought in [[Libya]] during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] in 1911, while his younger brother William fought in [[World War II]] and was captured by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in July 1943.<ref name="Sassari">{{cite web|title = L<U+2019>ultimo fante della Grande Guerra <U+00AB>Non dimenticate il nostro sacrificio<U+00BB>|publisher = La Brigata Sassari|date = 2003-11-01|url = http://www.centaurochirone.altervista.org/sassaridicono.htm|accessdate = 2007-12-20}} {{it icon}}</ref> He lived in the Garbatella district, one of the most secluded areas of Rome, on the fourth floor of a house without an elevator.<ref name="lernesto">{{cite web|last = Calderoni|first = Maria R.|title = Voci seniores, dal fante del <U+2019>15-<U+2019>18 a Fernanda Pivano|work = Cultura|publisher = l'ernesto|date = 2006-07-27|url = http://www.lernesto.it/index.aspx?m=77&f=2&IDArticolo=10797|accessdate = 2007-12-20}} {{it icon}}</ref> Before joining the war, he trained to become a [[mechanic]].<ref name="Times"/>

==Military career==
Orelli signed up for active duty at the age of 21 and joined the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] front at the onset of the war in May 1915.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|last = Arie|first = Sophie|title = Italy loses last veteran of great war|publisher = Reuters|date = 2005-01-26|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,1398589,00.html|accessdate = 2007-12-20}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Entrenched with the 320 Infantry Regiment, he served as a foot soldier within the [[Italian Army]] and engaged in combat activity in the [[trench warfare|trenches]] near [[Trieste]], which was the main battleground in the east.<ref name="Times"/> He also participated in combat operations around the [[So<U+010D>a|Isonzo]] river.<ref name="Trentino">{{cite web|last = Ghezzer|first = Alessandro|title = Ricordo della Grande Guerra|work = PICCOLO COLBRICON m 2511|publisher = Trentino|date = 2006|url = http://www.girovagandointrentino.it/rubriche/escursioni/p_colbricon/p_colbricon.htm|accessdate = 2007-12-20}} {{it icon}}</ref> In his autobiography, Orelli went into great detail about his experiences, including the large amount of casualties that he witnessed during his time in the trenches and widespread illiteracy among the peasant soldiers. He referred to them as having "died in silence."<ref name="Guardian"/> He also recalled many violent deaths, such as a friend whose feet were severed and subsequently bled to death and another who was decapitated in mid-conversation with Orelli. He remarked of episodes such as this that they were "things I do not wish to remember."<ref name="Times"/> 

In interviews, he also described the experiences of fear that were common among the soldiers, and lamented the way in which films portrayed combat experiences. When it came to [[cannon]] shells, for example, the impact was not immediate, but approached with a gradual and frightful sound. He referred to the chances of the shell exploding as the "lottery of death."<ref name="Tourism">{{cite web|title = I Was Twenty Years Old|work = THE GREAT WAR|publisher = Provincia TV|url = http://tourism.provincia.treviso.it/Proposte/INGLESE/grande%20guerra/pag4.htm|accessdate = 2007-12-20}}</ref> While he remembers many soldiers turning to [[distilled beverage|liquor]] to quell their fears, Orelli always refused it when offered.<ref name="Trentino"/> In order to mentally prepare himself for an attack, overcome this fear and keep a clear head, he forced himself to purge his mind of all thoughts of home and family. Orelli was eventually wounded in the right leg, an injury that ended his military career and sent him home.<ref name="Times"/> Despite having vivid memories of the war itself, he recalled little of the events immediately following his injury. During a confrontation with a group of Austrian soldiers, he was wounded in the leg and the left ear, a wound that was only a few inches away from being fatal. After being taken to a nearby farmhouse, he spent the rest of the war recovering from infection in hospitals, of which he remembered little.<ref name="Sassari"/>

==Post-World War I==
After the war, Orelli resumed his previous occupation as a mechanic. He had six children after the war, one son and five daughters born between 1920 and 1935, all of whom survived him. He also had nine grandchildren and eleven great-grandchildren at the time of his death. Although he was opposed to [[fascism]], he found himself directing [[artillery]] in [[Gaeta]] during the Second World War, where he met his wife Cecilia. After the war, he returned to Rome and settled down with his family in Garbatella.<ref name="Sassari"/> He retired from his mechanic job in 1960 and his wife died in 1969.<ref name="Times"/><ref name="aritaly">{{cite web|title = 22 Gennaio 2005 - Addio Carlo Orelli|publisher = aritaly.net|date = 2005-01-22|url = http://www.aritaly.net/orelli1.asp|accessdate = 2007-12-20}} {{it icon}}</ref> In his later years, he was active in telling tales of his experiences in the First World War, imploring those who listened to "not forget our sacrifice."<ref name="Sassari"/> In 2003, on the occasion of his 109th birthday, Italian President [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] made Orelli a Grand Officer in the [[Order of the Crown of Italy|Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]].<ref name="Order">{{cite web|title = Il Presidente Ciampi ha conferito l'onorificenza di Grande Ufficiale al Sig.
