'''Dragomir ''Dragi'' Jovanovi<U+0107>''' (July 27, 1902 in [[Po<U+017E>arevac]] &ndash; July 17, 1946 in [[Belgrade]]) was a Serbian politician and Axis collaborator. 

Jovanovi<U+0107> finished a law degree at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Law School]]. He received a job as a police officer in the city. When he later uncovered an alleged [[Croats|Croatian]] plot against [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] during his visit to [[Zagreb]], he was made chief of police of Belgrade. After Alexander declared a dictatorship, Jovanovi<U+0107> moved to an anti-communist unit. He remained in the police force up until the [[Second World War]]. 

After the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]'s dissolution, Jovanovi<U+0107> was declared mayor of Belgrade by [[Serbia]]'s [[Nedi<U+0107>'s Serbia|Axis-collaborating regime]]. For a period of time he was also in charge of the [[Gendarmerie (Serbia)|Serbian Gendarmarie]].

When the [[Yugoslav Partisan]] resistance threatened the Serbian regime in 1944, Jovanovi<U+0107> fled the nation to [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]. [[OZNA]] agents later discovered him there and returned him to the new [[communist Yugoslavia]] in 1945. He was tried as part of the [[Belgrade Process]]. He was found guilty of liquidating members of the People<U+2019>s Liberation Movement, operating the [[Banjica concentration camp]], German collaboration, holding talks with [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]] and organizing a meeting between Mihailovi<U+0107> and Serbian leader [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]].

He was hanged in Belgrade on July 17, 1946.
