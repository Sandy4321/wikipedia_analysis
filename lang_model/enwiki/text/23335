'''''Blade Runner''''' is an influential [[1982 in film|1982]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] which depicts a [[dystopia]]n [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in November 2019. The [[screenplay]], written by [[Hampton Fancher]] and [[David Peoples]], is loosely based on the [[novel]] ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]]. The film features [[Harrison Ford]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Sean Young]], [[Edward James Olmos]] and [[Daryl Hannah]]. The lead art designer was [[Syd Mead]], and the [[soundtrack]] composer was [[Vangelis]].

The film depicts a future in which genetically manufactured beings called [[replicant]]s are used for dangerous and degrading work in [[Earth]]'s "[[Space colonization|off-world colonies]]." Built to be 'more human than human', they appear physically identical to adult humans &ndash; although they have superior strength and agility &ndash; while lacking comparable "[[empathy]]", as they haven't the years of emotional experience humans take for granted. Replicants became illegal on Earth after a bloody [[mutiny]]. Specialist police units &ndash; blade runners &ndash; hunt down and "retire" (i.e. kill) escaped replicants on Earth. The plot primarily focuses on a particularly brutal and cunning group of replicants hiding in Los Angeles and a semi-retired blade runner, named Rick Deckard, who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment.

''Blade Runner'' initially polarized [[film critics|critics]]; some were displeased that it hadn't the pacing expected of an action film while others appreciated its thematic complexity. The film performed poorly in North American theaters but achieved success overseas. Despite poor early ticket sales, it was embraced by fans and academics and became a [[cult classic]]. ''Blade Runner'' has been hailed for its production design, one said to depict a "retrofitted future" as it presents a world with familiar architecture and artifacts with technological enhancements in a damp gritty atmosphere. The film is credited with prefiguring important concerns of the 21st century, including [[climate change]], [[globalization]], [[transhumanism]], [[genetic engineering]] and [[cloning]]. It remains a foremost exemplar of [[cyberpunk]] and [[neo-noir]] and observers continue to see its myriad influence on culture. ''Blade Runner'' brought author [[Philip K. Dick]] to the attention of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], and several films have since been made from his writings.

Seven versions of the film have been created for various markets and as a result of controversial changes made by film executives. A rushed [[Director's cut|Director's Cut]] was done in 1992 after a strong response to workprint screenings. This in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental made it one of the first films to see a [[DVD]] release. [[Warner Bros.]] announced in January 2006 the upcoming 25th anniversary theatrical and DVD release in 2007 of the long-awaited remastered definitive Final Cut by Scott.

== Production ==
The [[screenplay]] by [[Hampton Fancher]], which was initially titled ''Android'', and then ''Dangerous Days'', attracted producer [[Michael Deeley]], who eventually convinced director [[Ridley Scott]] to create his first American film. Scott had previously passed on the project, but soon after, he bailed out of the slow production of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'' and wanted a faster project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death. With Scott onboard on [[February 21]], [[1980]], the movie studios began lining up to finance the film. On April 9th, [[Filmways, Inc.|Filmways Pictures]] promised $13 million; but after a request by Scott it was bumped up to $15 million.

When Scott noted Deckard's line of work needed a new name, Fancher happened upon a copy of ''Bladerunner, A Movie'', which was a cinema treatment by [[William S. Burroughs]] for [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s novel ''The Bladerunner'' (1974). Scott liked it and Deeley obtained the rights to the titles, but Scott soon considered ''Blade Runner'' a working title for the film and wanted to find something more "commercial". (Note: Some editions of Nourse's novel use the two-word spacing ''Blade Runner''.)

Scott became unhappy with the direction of the script and had [[David Peoples]] rewrite it. This infuriated Fancher, who quit on [[December 20]], [[1980]] (he came back near the end to do some rewrites), because he believed a hack was hired to give Scott what he wanted. But after reading the Peoples script, he was surprised how well Scott's ideas were incorporated into the script, and in the end, Fancher and Peoples became good friends.

Then disaster struck when Filmways pulled their financial backing weeks away from principal photography and after investing over $2.5 million in pre-production. This forced Deeley to scramble for new financing and in ten days he managed to secure $21.5 million in financing through a three way deal between [[The Ladd Company]] (through [[Warner Bros.]]), the [[Hong Kong]]-based producer Sir [[Run Run Shaw]], and [[Tandem Productions]]. This would later prove problematic as the release of the film's Special Edition (Final Cut) was delayed as a result of legal wrangling over distribution rights.

Just as things were coming together, [[Philip K. Dick]] became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, and it was a snub he didn't appreciate. After some heated phone calls and an article in the Los Angeles ''[[Select TV Guide]]'' critical of an early script, the studio became cooperative by sending Dick the Peoples rewrite <U+2014> Dick was relieved to see how the script had evolved. Philip K. Dick died before the film's release, but he did manage to see a forty-minute special effects test reel, which converted him from a skeptic into a full supporter of the film, as it looked just as he had imagined it.

Principal photography of Blade Runner began on [[March 9]], [[1981]].

Prior to [[principal photography]], [[Paul Sammon|Paul M. Sammon]] was commissioned by ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine to do a special article on the making of ''Blade Runner''. His detailed observations and research later became the book ''[[Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner]]'', which is commonly referred to as the "Blade Runner Bible" by many of the film's fans. The book outlines not only the evolution of ''Blade Runner'' but also the politics and difficulties on set.  It focuses particularly on the British director's experiences with his first American crew. It also sheds light on Scott's directing style, which caused friction with the cast and likely contributed to Harrison Ford's subsequent reluctance to discuss the film.

[[Image:BladeRunner Sun.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Tyrell dimming the sun]]
In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], November 2019, [[Rick Deckard]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) is called out of retirement when a fellow Blade Runner <U+2014> [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Holden|Holden]] ([[Morgan Paull]]) <U+2014> is shot during a [[Voight-Kampff machine|Voight-Kampff test]] by [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Leon Kowalski|Leon]] ([[Brion James]]), an escaped replicant.

A reluctant Deckard is brought to his old boss [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Bryant|Bryant]] ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]), who informs him that the recent escape of Nexus-6 replicants is the worst yet. Deckard declines getting involved but relents after Bryant threatens him enigmatically.

Bryant briefs Deckard on the replicants: [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]] ([[Rutger Hauer]]) is a commando, Leon a soldier and manual laborer, [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Zhora|Zhora]] ([[Joanna Cassidy]]) a [[sex worker]] retrained as an assassin, and [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Pris|Pris]] ([[Daryl Hannah]]) a "basic pleasure model." Bryant also explains that the Nexus-6 model has a four-year lifespan as a failsafe against their developing unstable emotions. Deckard is teamed up with [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Gaff|Gaff]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) and sent to the [[Tyrell Corporation]] to ensure that the Voight-Kampff test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, Deckard discovers that [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Tyrell's]] ([[Joe Turkel]]) young secretary [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Rachael|Rachael]] ([[Sean Young]]) is an experimental replicant (who believes she is a human) with implanted memories from Tyrell's niece, which provide a cushion for her emotions.

Deckard and Gaff search Leon's apartment as Roy and Leon force [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Chew|Chew]] ([[James Hong]]), an eye designer, to direct them to [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#J.F. Sebastian|J.F. Sebastian]] ([[William Sanderson]]) who can lead them to Tyrell. Later, Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity to him, but leaves in tears after Deckard recites several of her most secret memories and states they were not her memories at all, but were implanted. Pris meets up with Sebastian and takes advantage of his loneliness and kind nature to gain access to his apartment.

Clues from Leon's apartment lead Deckard to [[List of minor characters in Blade Runner#Taffy Lewis|Taffy Lewis']] ([[Hy Pyke]]) bar where the tattooed Zhora is performing with a snake. Zhora attacks Deckard and makes a desperate attempt to get away into the crowded streets; Deckard chases her down and "retires" her. After the shooting, Gaff and Bryant show up and inform Deckard that Rachael will also need to be "retired". Deckard conveniently spots Rachael in the distance, though as he follows her he is suddenly disarmed by Leon who then proceeds to beat him. Rachael kills Leon, saving Deckard's life, and they go back to Deckard's apartment where they discuss her options, and in a rough scene ending in musical intimacy they begin to fall in love.

Meanwhile, Roy arrives at Sebastian's apartment and they convince Sebastian to bring Roy to meet Tyrell. Once in Tyrell's bedroom Roy demands an extension to his lifespan and requests absolution for his sins from the Godlike replicant creator; upon receiving neither he kills Tyrell and Sebastian.

Deckard is sent to Sebastian's apartment and is ambushed by Pris, though he manages to shoot her after a struggle. Roy returns moments later, trapping Deckard in the apartment and playfully hunts him throughout the dilapidated [[Bradbury Building]], eventually forcing him to the roof. Deckard attempts a jump to another building and ends up desperately hanging from a beam. Roy easily makes the jump and stares down at Deckard <U+2014> just as Deckard loses his grip Roy grabs his wrist and saves his life. Roy is deteriorating quickly (his 4-year lifespan is up) as he sits down in the rain and eloquently marvels at the highlights of his life and concludes, "All those moments... will be lost... in time... like tears... in rain. Time... to die." Roy quietly dies as Deckard looks on in silence. Gaff arrives in a [[Spinner (Blade Runner)|spinner]] shortly afterward and, as he's leaving, cryptically shouts, "It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?"

Deckard returns to his apartment and cautiously enters when he sees the door is ajar. He finds Rachael alive and as they leave Deckard comes across an [[origami]] [[calling card]] left by Gaff; he has allowed them to escape, and they depart toward an uncertain future together.

== Themes ==
{{Main|Themes in Blade Runner}}
[[Image:BladeRunner Bradbury.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Dark sprawl overlooked by the glimmering towers of LA 2019]]
Despite the initial appearance of an action film, ''Blade Runner'' operates on an unusually rich number of dramatic levels. As with much of the [[cyberpunk]] genre, it owes a large debt to [[film noir]], containing and exploring such conventions as the [[femme fatale]], a [[Raymond Chandler|Chandleresque]] first-person narration (removed in later versions), and the questionable moral outlook of the [[Hero]] <U+2014> extended here to include even the humanity of the hero, as well as the usual dark and shadowy [[cinematography]].

It is one of the most literate science fiction films, both thematically <U+2014> enfolding the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[morality|moral]] implications of the increasing human mastery of [[genetic engineering]], within the context of [[History of theater|classical Greek drama]] and its notions of [[hubris]]<ref>Jenkins, Mary. (1997) [http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/content/v14.4/jenkins.html ''The Dystopian World of Blade Runner: An Ecofeminist Perspective'']</ref> <U+2014> and linguistically, drawing on the poetry of [[William Blake]] and the [[Bible]]. ''Blade Runner'' also features a [[chess]] game based on the famous [[Immortal Game]] of 1851. (The king and queen are interposed on Tyrell's side, a position which a [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] would never attempt.)

''Blade Runner'' delves into the future implications of [[technology]] on the [[natural environment|environment]] and society by reaching into the past using literature, [[religious symbolism]], classical dramatic themes and [[film noir]]. This tension between past, present and future is apparent in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner, which is [[High tech|high-tech]] and gleaming in places but elsewhere decayed and old.

A high level of [[paranoia]] is present throughout the film with the visual manifestation of [[Corporation|corporate]] power, omnipresent police, probing lights; and in the power over the individual represented particularly by genetic programming of the replicants. Control over the environment is seen on a large scale but also with how animals are created as mere commodities. This oppressive backdrop clarifies why many people are going to the off-world colonies, which clearly parallels the migration to the [[Americas]]. The popular 1980s prediction of America being economically surpassed by [[Japan]] is reflected in the domination of Japanese culture and advertising in LA 2019. The film also makes extensive use of eyes and manipulated images to call into question reality and our ability to perceive it.

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for ''Blade Runner's'' central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used with a number of questions focused on the treatment of animals, thus making it the essential indicator of someone's "humanity". The replicants are juxtaposed with human characters who are unempathetic, while the replicants appear to show passion and concern for one another at the same time as the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is a replicant, and forces the audience to reevaluate what it means to be [[human]].<ref>Kerman, Judith. (1991) ''Retrofitting Blade Runner: Issues in Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner" and Philip K. Dick's "Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?"'' ISBN 0879725109</ref>

=== Is Deckard a replicant? ===
:''Main article: [[Themes in Blade Runner#Deckard: replicant or human.3F|Deckard: replicant or human?]]''

The question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release. Ridley Scott, after remaining coy on the subject for twenty years, stated in 2002 that Deckard is a replicant. Hampton Fancher and Harrison Ford, however, have both stated that Deckard is human. The rough consensus of the dialogue is that in the original version of the film Deckard is probably human, whereas the Director's Cut is more ambigious, deliberately hinting that he may be another replicant. Specifically, the Director's Cut includes a short sequence in which Deckard dreams about a [[unicorn]]. This sequence alters the significance of the origami unicorn that Gaff leaves in Deckard's apartment, suggesting to the viewer (and to Deckard, as well) that Gaff knows about Deckard's dream in the same manner that Deckard knows about Rachael's implanted memories. A specific answer to whether or not Deckard is human or replicant is not found in the film -- the purpose of raising the question is not to provide a definitive answer, but to add additional layers of ambiguity to the film's questions about humanity and reality.

== Cast ==
With the exception of Harrison Ford, ''Blade Runner'' had a significant number of then-unknown actors in its cast:
[[Image:BladeRunner Deckard and Rachael.jpg|260px|thumb|Deckard and Rachael share a moment.]]
*[[Harrison Ford]] as Rick Deckard. Coming off some success with ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'', but still a year before ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was released, Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. After [[Steven Spielberg]] praised Ford and showed some ''Raiders'' rushes to [[Michael Deeley|Deeley]] and [[Ridley Scott|Scott]] they got Ford onboard. Due to the initially poor reception of ''Blade Runner'' and friction with Scott, Ford has usually avoided discussing the film.
*[[Rutger Hauer]] as Roy Batty. Hauer gave a brief but "effective" performance as the violent yet complex leader of [[replicant]]s with nothing to lose;<ref>Ebert, Roger. (1992) [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920911/REVIEWS/209110301/1023 RogerEbert.com <U+2013> Review of Blade Runner]</ref> and was regarded by Philip K. Dick as the "perfect Batty <U+2014> cold, Aryan, flawless."<ref>Sammon, Paul. (1996) Pg. 284</ref> Of the many films Hauer has done, ''Blade Runner'' is his favorite. As he explains:

::"Blade Runner ''needs no explanation. It just IZZ. All of the best. There is nothing like it. To be part of a real MASTERPIECE which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome."'' <ref>[http://www.brmovie.com/Profiles/BR_Cast_Hauer.htm BRMovie.com &ndash; Rutger Hauer]</ref>

*[[Sean Young]] as Rachael. The picture of female "perfection" at 22 years old, Young still counts ''Blade Runner'' among her favorite films, despite friction with Ford and Scott as a result of her inexperience and youth.
*[[Edward James Olmos]] as Gaff. Olmos used his diverse ethnic background to help create the fictional "Cityspeak" language his character uses in the film.
*[[Daryl Hannah]] as Pris. Hannah managed to bring out the dangerous innocence of a replicant in love with Roy Batty.

Supporting roles:
*[[M. Emmet Walsh]] as Captain Bryant. Walsh lived up to his reputation as a great character actor with the role of a hard drinking police veteran.
*[[Joe Turkel]] as Dr. Eldon Tyrell. With a confident penetrating voice and a panache for self-aggrandizement, this corporate mogul has built an empire on [[slavery]].
*[[William Sanderson]] as J.F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. This led to more varied work for Sanderson.
*[[Brion James]] as Leon. Although at first glance a dumb [[replicant]] used for muscle, Leon did have an undertone of intuitive intelligence.
*[[Joanna Cassidy]] as Zhora. Cassidy portrays a strong woman who has seen the worst humanity has to offer.
*[[Morgan Paull]] as Holden. 
*[[James Hong]] as Hannibal Chew. An elder geneticist who loves his work, especially with synthesizing [[eye]]s.
*[[Hy Pyke]] as Taffey Lewis. Pyke conveys Lewis' sleasiness with ease and apparently with one take; something unheard of with Scott's drive for perfection resulting at times in double digit takes.
*Unknown as Abdul Hassan. It remains a mystery as to who played the snake dealer Deckard interrogates.

== Music ==
{{Main|Blade Runner (soundtracks)}}

The ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack by [[Vangelis]] is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by [[Ridley Scott]]. Vangelis, fresh off of his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning score from [[Chariots of Fire]], composed and performed the music on his [[synthesizer]]s. The musicscape of the 2019 was created in Vangelis' "space" mode of [[new age music]], as heard on such albums of his as ''[[Heaven and Hell (Vangelis album)|Heaven and Hell]]''. He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator [[Demis Roussos]]. Ridley Scott also used "Memories of Green" from Vangelis' album ''[[See You Later]]'' (an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film ''[[Someone To Watch Over Me]]'').

:''"Both emotional and unsettling, the Blade Runner score plays off conflict (discord versus harmony, light against dark) for a rich, textured tapestry of sound."'' <U+2013> [http://www.musicoutfitter.com/store/item/075678262326/bladerunner.html musicoutfitter.com]

Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed <U+2014> nominated in 1983 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] as best original score <U+2014> and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the original soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, The New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would in 1989 surface on the compilation ''Themes'', but it wasn't until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see the light of day. However, while most of the tracks on the album are from the film, there were a few that Vangelis composed but were ultimately not used and some new pieces. Many do not consider this to be a satisfying representation of the score.

[[Image:BladeRunner Esper Edition CD 2.jpg|thumb|260px|Esper Edition - Disc Two]]

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 "Off World Music, Ltd." created a bootleg [[compact disc|CD]] that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994. A disc from "Gongo Records" features most of the same material, but with slightly better sound quality. In 2003, two other bootlegs surfaced, the "Esper Edition," closely preceded by "Los Angeles - November 2019." The double disc "Esper Edition" combined tracks from the official release, the Gongo boot and the film itself. Finally "2019" provided a single disc compilation almost wholly consisting of ambient sound from the film, padded out with some sounds from the Westwood game ''Blade Runner''. The Gongo release is considered the best presentation of the music, while Los Angeles - November 2019 and the Esper Edition are excellent mementos of the film.

}}
''Blade Runner'' was released in 1,290 theaters on [[June 25]] [[1982]]. That date was chosen by producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] because his previous highest-grossing films (''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'') had a similar opening date ([[May 25]]) in 1977 and 1979, making the date his "lucky day."<ref>Sammon, Paul. (1996)</ref> However, the gross for the opening weekend was a disappointing $6.15 million. A significant factor in the film's rather poor box office performance was that its release coincided with another science fiction film, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which was released in the U.S. on June 11, 1982, and dominated box office revenues at the time.

Film critics were polarized as some felt the story had taken a back seat to special effects and that it was not the action/adventure the studio had advertised. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time.<ref>Sammon, Paul. (1996)</ref>

A general criticism was its slow pacing that detracts from other strengths;<ref>Hicks, Chris. (1992) [http://deseretnews.com/movies/view/0,1257,200,00.html DeseretNews.com <U+2013> Review of Blade Runner]</ref> one film critic went so far as to call it "Blade Crawler."<ref>Flynn, John. (2003) [http://www.towson.edu/~flynn/br.htm Towson.edu <U+2013> Blade Runner Retrospective]</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] praised ''Blade Runner''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s visuals, but found the human story a little thin. Ebert thought Tyrell's character unconvincing and the apparent lack of security measures allowing Roy to murder him problematic. Also he believed the relationship between Deckard and Rachael seemed "to exist more for the plot than for them."<ref>Ebert, Roger. (1992)</ref>

Other critics have countered that the strong visuals serve to create a dehumanized world where human elements stand out. Furthermore the relationship between Deckard and Rachael could be essential in reaffirming their respective humanity.<ref>Rutledge, Sean M. (2000) [http://www.candidcritic.com/blade_runner.htm CandidCritic.com <U+2013> Review of Blade Runner]</ref> In a later episode of their show, Ebert and [[Gene Siskel]] admit they were wrong about their early negative reviews and that they consider the film to be a modern classic.

Initially avoided by [[North America]]n audiences, ''Blade Runner'' was popular internationally and has become a [[cult film|cult]] classic. The film's enduring popularity and cult status has made it popular to reference in other media. The television show ''[[Futurama]]'' has made multiple references to ''Blade Runner'', and the shows ''[[Cutting It]]'', ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' have used quotes from the film. Actor [[William Sanderson]], who played Sebastian, voiced a similar character in the cartoon series ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''. In the action film ''[[The 6th Day]]'', a virtual [[psychologist]] says, "You seem to be avoiding talking about your parents. Imagine, two turtles are walking through the desert...", and one of the villains, (played by [[<U+00C9>douard Montoute]]) in "[[Asterix|Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra]]" is called Nexusis in reference to the replicants' model. 

It is also notable that ''Blade Runner's'' opening frames feature a tight close-up on a human eye; ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and certain episodes of the 2004 television series [[Lost (TV Series)|LOST]] start with similar shots.  ''Blade Runner'' cannot, however, be entirely credited as the inspiration for this characteristic shot, since [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', released over two decades earlier, begins with a similar close-up.  Rather, ''Blade Runner'' fits into a wider tradition, tapping into ''Vertigo's'' power and linking on multiple levels with its plot.

''Blade Runner's'' dark [[cyberpunk]] style and futuristic design have served as a benchmark and inspired many subsequent science fiction films and television programs, including ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'', ''[[Batman (1989 movie)|Batman]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[The Fifth Element]]'', ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', and ''[[The Matrix]]''. It has also influenced [[anime]], including ''[[Akira (film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell (film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'', Armitage III, ''[[Silent M<U+00F6>bius]]'', ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'', [[AD Police Files]], [[Parasite Dolls]], and ''[[Ergo Proxy]]''. Before shooting began on ''[[Batman Begins]]'', director [[Christopher Nolan]] reportedly screened ''Blade Runner'' to the film's crew and told them, "This is how we're going to make Batman." Even the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Prequel trilogy (Star Wars)|prequels]] have paid homage to ''Blade Runner'' in their special effects sequences.<ref>Brinkley, Aaron. Gunn, R. (2002) [http://www.bladezone.com/contents/film/tie-ins/star-wars/ The Blade Runner / Star Wars References]</ref> The Bradbury scene influenced the 1986 [[music video]] of ''Tonight, Tonight, Tonight'' by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], where similar photography was used as Collins walks through the Bradbury.

:"Blade Runner ''is a unique film, incredible on every level. It is a prophetic and emotional tale that stands as one of the most original and intelligent science fiction films ever made."'' <U+2013> [http://www.apolloguide.com/mov_print.asp?CID=2301&RID= Alex Ioshpe]

The film is often thought to have inspired [[William Gibson (novelist)|William Gibson's]] ''[[Neuromancer]]''.<ref>Mariman, Lukas. (2000) [http://www.brmovie.com/FAQs/BR_FAQ_BR_Influence.htm BR FAQ: Influence]</ref> Gibson has said in interviews that he was already writing ''Neuromancer'' when ''Blade Runner'' was released, and was actually inspired by the implied background of the film ''[[Alien (movie)|Alien]]''. The film arguably marks the introduction of the [[cyberpunk]] genre into popular culture. ''Blade Runner'' continues to reflect modern trends and concerns, and an increasing number consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.<ref>Jha, Alok. Rogers, S. Rutherford, A.

Notably, the character Roy Batty served as the apparent inspiration of several [[Rock music|rock]] songs. In the song "Show Me How to Live" by [[Audioslave]], the lyrics include "''Nail in my hand / from my creator / you gave me life / now show me how to live''." During the final fight scene between Batty and Deckard, Batty sticks a nail through his hand to prevent it from closing up. The song also includes references to science fiction themes; "''And in the aching night under satellites / I was not received / Built with stolen parts / A telephone in my heart''." The song "More Human Than Human" by [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] named after Tyrell Corp. motto "More human than human", has the lyrics "''I am the Nexus One / I want more life / Fucker, I ain't done''." This is in reference to Batty's famous line "I want more life, fucker!". [[Gary Numan]]'s ballad "Time To Die" puts Batty's dying monologue to suitably emotional music. A great fan of the film, Numan also used extracts lifted directly from the soundtrack on his 1985 album "The Fury".  [[Pop Will Eat Itself]] also had a 1989 track titled "Wake up, time to die...".

:''"Ridley Scott's film remains the defining vision of futuristic science fiction."'' <U+2013> [http://www.cinescape.com/0/Editorial.asp?aff_id=0&this_cat=Movies&action=page&obj_id=19571 Steve Biodrowski]

''Blade Runner'' also served to influence the [[cyberpunk]] [[adventure game]] ''[[Snatcher]]'', the [[role-playing game]] ''[[Shadowrun]]'', the seminal computer game ''[[System Shock]]'' and the ''[[Syndicate computer games|Syndicate]]'' games. The fictional language Cityspeak spoken on the overcrowded and multi-lingual streets of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], 2019; is described by Deckard as a "mishmash of Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you." It has been used in many cyberpunk genre role-playing games.

== Versions ==
Seven versions of the film exist, but only the Director's Cut and International Cut are widely known and seen:
*The original 1982 International Cut (also known as Criterion Edition), which included more graphic violence than the U.S. theatrical release, and which was released on [[VHS]] and on [[Criterion Collection]] [[Laserdisc]].
*The U.S. theatrical version (also known as Original Version), also called the ''domestic cut''.
*Two workprint versions, shown only as audience test previews and occasionally at film festivals; one of these was distributed in 1991, as a ''Director's Cut'' without Scott's approval.
*The Ridley Scott-approved 1992 Director's Cut; prompted by the unauthorized 1991 release, it is to date the only version officially released on DVD.
*The broadcast version, edited for [[profanity]].
*Warner Home Video has announced that Ridley Scott's final cut of the film will be released both theatrically and on DVD in 2007.<ref>Scotsman.com. (2006) [http://news.scotsman.com/latest_entertainment.cfm?id=797712006 Scotsman.com <U+2014> 'Blade Runner' replicated on DVD again]</ref>

=== Theatrical versions ===
The 1982 American and European theatrical versions released by the studio included a "happy ending" (using stock footage from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') and a [[voice-over]] added at the request of studio executives during [[post-production]] after test audience members indicated difficulty understanding the film. Although several different versions of the script had included a voice-over of some sort, both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford disliked the studio V.O. and resisted having it added to the film. It's been rumored Ford intentionally did the voice-over poorly in the hope it wouldn't be used,<ref>Sammon, Paul. (1996) Page 298</ref> but recent interviews indicate otherwise.<ref>IMDB. (2005) [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/trivia Trivia for Blade Runner]</ref>

=== Director's Cut ===
[[Image:BladeRunner Unicorn1.jpg|right|275px|thumb|right|Deckard's daydream in the 1992 Director's Cut]]

In 1990, Warner Bros briefly allowed theatrical screenings of a 70 mm copy of the workprint version of the film, advertising it as a Director's Cut. However, Ridley Scott publicly disowned the workprint version of the film as his definitive Director's Cut, citing that it was roughly edited and lacked the score composed for the film by [[Vangelis]]. In response to Scott's dissatisfaction (and in part because of the film's resurgent cult popularity in the early 90s) Warner Brothers decided to assemble a definitive Director's Cut of the film with direction from Scott to be released in 1992.

They hired film-restorationist Michael Arick, who had been the one that rediscovered the workprint of Blade Runner and who was already doing consultation work for them, to head up the project with Scott. He started by spending several months in [[London]] with Les Healey, who had been the assistant editor on Blade Runner, attempting to compile a list of the changes that Scott wanted made to the film. He also got a number of suggestions/directions directly from the director himself. Arick made several changes to the film, most of them fairly minor editing changes, including the reinsertion of Deckard finding Gaff's origami unicorn in the hallway near his apartment at the film's closing. However, three major changes were made to the film which most would agree significantly changed the feel of the film: the removal of Deckard's explanatory voice-over, the re-insertion of a dream sequence of a unicorn running through a forest, and the removal of the studio imposed "happy-ending", including some associated visuals which had originally run under the film's end-credits.

Scott has since complained that time and money constraints and his obligation to ''[[Thelma and Louise]]'' kept him from retooling the film in a completely satisfactory manner, and that while he's happier than before with the 1992 release of the film, he's never felt entirely comfortable with it as his definitive Director's Cut.

A digitally remastered 2-disc Director's Cut DVD will be released in 2006.

=== Special Edition ===
Partly as the result of those complaints, Scott was invited back in mid-2000 to help put together a final and definitive version of the film, which was completed in mid-2001. During the process, a new digital print of the film was created from the original negatives, special effects were updated and cleaned, and the sound was remastered in 5.1 [[Dolby Digital]] surround sound. Unlike the rushed 1992 Director's Cut, Scott personally oversaw the new cut as it was being made. The Special Edition DVD was slated for a Christmas time 2001 release, and was originally rumored to be a three-disc set including the full international theatrical cut, the 1992 director's cut and the newly enhanced version in addition to deleted scenes, extensive cast and crew interviews, and the documentary "On the Edge of Blade Runner". But [[Warner Bros]] indefinitely delayed the "Special Edition" release after legal disputes began with the film's original [[completion bond]] guarantors (specifically [[Jerry Perenchio]]), who were ceded ownership of the film when the shooting ran over budget from $21.5 to $28 million. 

After several years of waiting through fears that the legal disputes would never end, fans have been rewarded with a tenative announcement by Warner Brothers. According to [[Total Film]] magazine and [[The Digital Bits]], Warner Bros. is putting the final touches on several versions of the film that will be made available starting in late 2006. Sources disagree somewhat on how the releases will be scheduled, but the most current information indicates that a restored version of the 1992 Director's Cut will be released first in its own two-disc set, and that it will be available only between September and December of 2006. Following the release of the 2-disc 1992 DC, [[The Digital Bits]] is reporting that Warner Brothers will release Ridley Scott's new Director's Cut of the film into theatres sometime in early 2007 to be followed by a multi-disc set containing both previously mentioned versions of the film plus both the American and European theatrical versions.

== Documentaries ==
[[Image:BladeRunner Fancher and Peoples.jpg|right|thumb|275px|From the ''Edge'' documentary, featuring ''Blade Runner'' screenwriters Fancher (left) and Peoples, now friends]]

'''''On the Edge of Blade Runner''''' (55 minutes), produced in 2000 by Nobles Gate Ltd. (for [[Channel 4]]), was directed by [[Andrew Abbott]] and hosted/written by [[Mark Kermode]], and will be included in the Special Edition. Interviews with production staff, including Ridley give details into the creative process and turmoil during preproduction. Stories from [[Paul M. Sammon]] and Fancher provide insight into [[Philip K. Dick]] and the origins of ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''

Interweaved are cast interviews with the notable exceptions of [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Sean Young]]. Through these interviews we get a sense of how difficult and frustrating the film was to make as a result of an exacting director without allies and hot, wet, smoggy conditions; which added to the high pressure atmosphere everyone increasingly felt as the film went over budget. There is also a tour of some locations, most notably the [[Bradbury Building]] and the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] backlot that was the LA 2019 streets, which look very different from Ridley's dark version.

The documentary then details the test screenings postproduction editing/changes (voice over and happy ending, deleted Holden hospital scene), special effects, soundtrack by [[Vangelis]], and the unhappy relationship between the filmmakers and the investors; which culminated in Deeley and Ridley being fired but still working on the film. The question of whether or not [[Themes in Blade Runner#Deckard: replicant or human.3F|Deckard]] is a replicant surfaces. After being a "disaster" in the box office (a financial loss initially) Blade Runner was reborn in the video rental market, and a great reception of a chance screening of Ridley's workprint at the Fairfax Theater, Los Angeles, in May 1990 led to Warner Bros. having the "Director's Cut" done by film archivist [[Michael Arick]].

'''''Future Shocks''''' (27 minutes), a more recent documentary from 2003 by [[TVOntario]] (as part of their [[Film 101]] series), has interviews with executive producer [[Bud Yorkin]], [[Syd Mead]], and the cast along with Sean Young, but again without Harrison Ford. There is extensive commentary by science fiction author [[Robert J. Sawyer]] and film critics as the documentary focuses on the themes, visual impact and influence of the film. Olmos goes into Ford's participation and personal experiences during filming are related by Young, Walsh, Cassidy and Sanderson. They also relate a story where crew members created t-shirts which took pot shots at Ridley. The versions of the film are critiqued and how closely Blade Runner predicted the future is discussed.

== Novel ==
:''See also: [[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?#Differences between the novel and film|Differences Between the Novel and Film]]''

The original screenplay by [[Hampton Fancher]] was based loosely on [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', which he optioned in 1980 after an unsuccessful previous attempt. However, Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith, which weighed heavily in the novel. When [[Ridley Scott]] became involved with the film, he wanted changes to the script made, and eventually hired [[David Peoples]] to perform the re-writes after Fancher refused. The film's title also changed several times during the writing process, it was to be called ''Dangerous Days'' in Fancher's last draft before eventually taking the name Blade Runner, actually borrowed (with permission) from a [[William S. Burroughs]] treatment of [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s science fiction novel ''The Bladerunner'' (1974).

As a result of Fancher's divergence from the novel, numerous re-writes before and throughout shooting the film, and the fact that Ridley Scott never entirely read the novel it was based on, the film diverged significantly from its original inspiration. The changes have led many critics and fans to consider them as independent works of fiction, despite the fact that the novel ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' was reprinted for a time with the title ''Blade Runner'' with the intention of promoting sales. Some of the themes in the novel that were minimized or entirely removed include: fertility/sterility of the population, [[religion]], [[mass media]], Deckard's uncertainty that he is human, and real versus synthetic [[pet]]s and [[emotion]]s.

The producers of the film arranged for a screening of some rough cuts for Philip K. Dick shortly before he died in early 1982. Despite the fact that the movie deviated significantly from his book and his well known skepticism of [[Hollywood]] in principle, he became quite enthusiatic about the film. He predicted that: "This will change the way we look at movies."

== Sequels ==
Three official and authorized ''Blade Runner'' novels have been written by [[Philip K. Dick]]'s friend [[K. W. Jeter]] that continue the story of [[Rick Deckard]] and attempt to resolve many of the differences between ''Blade Runner'' and ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''.
*''[[Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human]]'' (1995)
*''[[Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night]]'' (1996)
*''[[Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon]]'' (2000)

[[David Peoples]], who co-wrote ''Blade Runner'' and wrote the [[1998 in film|1998]] film [[Soldier (film)|''Soldier'']], has said that ''Soldier'' is intended to be what he calls a "[[spin-off|sidequel]]" to ''Blade Runner''. ''Soldier'' takes place in the same [[fictional universe]], and the [[Spinner (Blade Runner)|spinners]] used in ''Blade Runner'' are also used in ''Soldier''. However, ''Soldier'' is an [[informal sequel]] as it was never formally approved by the ''Blade Runner'' partnership, which owns the rights to the ''Blade Runner'' universe.

Though not an official sequel to ''Blade Runner'', many fans have noted similarities between the 1999 [[television series]] ''[[Total Recall 2070]]'' and the ''Blade Runner'' universe. ''Total Recall 2070'' was based on two works by Phillip K. Dick: "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]" (the basis for ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]''), and ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (the basis for ''Blade Runner''), so many consider the series a sequel to (or at least a spin-off of) ''Blade Runner''.

== Games and comics ==
[[Image:BladeRunner PC Game (Front Cover).jpg|right|thumb|140px|PC game cover]]

There are two [[computer and video games|computer games]] based on the film, one for [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad]] CPC 6128 by CRL Group PLC (1985) based on the music by [[Vangelis]] (due to licensing issues), and another action adventure [[Blade Runner (videogame)|PC game]] by [[Westwood Studios]] (1997). The [[Blade Runner (videogame)|latter game]] featured new characters and branching storylines based on the ''Blade Runner'' world, coupled with voice work from some of the original cast from the film and some recurring locations from the film. It is noteworthy that the events portrayed in the 1997 game occur not after, but in parallel to those in the film - the player assumes the role of another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard, though of course they never meet, so as to remain consistent with the film. The game was highly advanced for its time, featuring a non linear plot, and advanced non player characters that each ran in their own independent AI. Unfortunately, the game was hobbled by an unusual 3D engine that was credible when the game went into production, but outclassed by the time the game was finally released.

A prototype board game was also created in California (1982) that had game play similar to [[Scotland Yard (board game)|Scotland Yard]].

The cult computer game ''[[Snatcher]]'' was heavily influenced by ''Blade Runner'', so much so that websites exist detailing the numerous similarities between the two.<ref>KoKee. (2001) [http://www.snatcher.co.uk/ Blade Runner & Snatcher]</ref>

[[Archie Goodwin]] scripted the comic book adaptation, ''A Marvel Comics Super Special: Blade Runner'', published September, 1982. The [[Jim Steranko]] cover leads into a 45-page adaptation illustrated by the team of [[Al Williamson]], Carlos Garzon, Dan Green and [[Ralph Reese]]. This adaptation was poorly received and widely ridiculed because of poor writing and misquoted dialogue taken from the film. (This adaptation includes one possible explanation of the title's significance in story context: the narrative line, "Blade runner. You're always movin' on the edge.") Also there was a parody comic of ''Blade Runner'' called ''Blade Bummer'' by [[Crazy (magazine)|Crazy]] comics.<ref>Kupperberg, Paul & Camp, Bob. (1982) [http://media.bladezone.com/contents/publications/magazines/crazy/ BladeZone.com <U+2013> Crazy: Blade Runner Parody]</ref>

[[Steve Gallacci]] wrote and illustrated an [[anthropomorphic]] [[parody]] of the film as ''Bad Rubber'' in the prototype issue (Number 0) of his comic book title ''[[Albedo Anthropomorphics]]''. The character based on Rick Deckard was a duck named "Rick Duckard".

== Curse ==
Among the folklore that has grown up around the film over the years has been the belief that the film was a [[curse]]<ref>[http://scribble.com/uwi/br/brfaq/faq-curse.html Curse] at the ''Blade Runner'' FAQ.</ref> to the companies whose [[logo]]s were displayed prominently in some scenes. While they were market leaders at the time, many of them experienced disastrous setbacks over the next decade and hardly exist today:
*[[Atari]], which dominated the [[video game console|home video game]] market when the film came out, never recovered from [[video game crash of 1983|the next year's downturn]] in the industry, and by the 1990s had ceased to exist as anything more than a brand, a back catalog of games and some legacy computers.
*The [[Bell System]] [[monopoly]] was broken up that same year, and all of the resulting [[Regional Bell operating companies]] have since changed their names and [[merger|merged]] with each other or other companies.
*[[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] suffered the destruction of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] and went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in 1991, after a decade of mounting losses.
*[[Cuisinart]] similarly went bankrupt in 1989.

[[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]] almost joined this list in the wake of its failed introduction of [[New Coke]] [[1985|three years later]], but has since experienced a thirty-fold increase in share price.
