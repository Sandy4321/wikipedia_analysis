'''''Mongrels''''', formerly known under the working titles of '''''We Are Mongrels''''' and '''''The Un-Natural World''''', is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Puppetry|puppet-based]] [[situation comedy]] series first broadcast on [[BBC Three]] between 22 June and 10 August 2010, with a [[making-of]] documentary entitled "Mongrels Uncovered" broadcast on 11 August 2010. A second series of ''Mongrels'' has been commissioned.<ref name="Ratings">{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/08/25/11610/mongrels_to_return|title=Mongrels to return|publisher=Chortle|date=25 August 2010|accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref>

The series revolves around the lives of five [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals who hang around the back of a [[Public house|pub]] in the [[Isle of Dogs]], [[London]]. The characters are Nelson, a [[metrosexual]] [[fox]] (voiced by [[Rufus Jones (actor)|Rufus Jones]], performed by [[Andy Heath (puppeteer)|Andy Heath]]); Destiny, a self-centred [[Afghan hound]] (voiced by [[Lucy Montgomery (actor)|Lucy Montgomery]], performed by [[Richard Coombs]]); Marion, a "borderline-[[Mental retardation|retarded]]" [[cat]] (voiced by [[Dan Tetsell]], performed by [[Warrick Brownlow-Pike]]); Kali, a grudge-bearing [[pigeon]] (voiced by [[Katy Brand]], performed by [[Iestyn Evans]]); and Vince, a [[sociopath]]ic foul-mouthed fox (voiced by [[Paul Kaye]], performed by various [[puppeteer]]s).

The show is aimed at an adult audience, features "[[neutering]], [[incontinence]], [[cannibalism]] and [[catnip]] overdoses" and humour styles such as [[slapstick]] and [[farce]]. For example, the first episode begins with a scene in which Marion, portrayed as desperately trying to revive his deceased owner, learns she has actually been dead for four months, whereupon he casually gives his cat friends permission to eat her.<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Michael|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7838589/Mongrels-the-new-BBC-Three-adult-puppet-comedy-is-a-shaggy-dog-story.html|title=Mongrels: the new BBC Three adult puppet comedy is a shaggy dog story|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=18 June 2010|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref> ''Mongrels'' has attracted accusations of [[plagiarism]], with claims that ''Mongrels'' stole ideas from a similar [[Channel 4]] show called ''[[Pets (TV series)|Pets]]''.<ref name="Chortle">{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2010/06/25/11266/the_fur_flies_over_mongrels|title=The fur flies over Mongrels|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=25 June 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[File:Mongrels Characters.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The main characters in ''Mongrels'' (left to right): Destiny, Nelson, Kali (top), Marion (bottom) and Vince.]]
{{main|List of Mongrels episodes}}
''Mongrels'' looks at the lives of five animals that hang around the back of a pub on the Isle of Dogs in the [[East End]] of London called The Lord Nelson. The hero of the series is Nelson (''Vulpus metrosexualus''), a fox who lives a [[metrosexual]] lifestyle. Described as: "The only wild fox in East London with subscriptions to all the major [[broadsheet]]s (excluding ''[[The Sunday Times]]''), Nelson is, as he never tires of introducing himself at dinner parties<U+2026> 'An urbane fox!'"<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00swyx1|title=Mongrels|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=10 May, 2010}}</ref>

Nelson's love interest is Destiny, an Afghan hound. However, Destiny has no interest in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary ([[Tony Way]]), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (''Felis retardicus''), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (''Aves aggravaticus''), a pigeon who likes to revel in the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince (''Vulpus c***itcus''), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one [[Profanity|swear word]] that is always [[Bleep censor|bleeped]] over.<ref name="BBC"/>

==Production==
===Creation===
The show took five years to make. The idea was first suggested between the creator and director of ''Mongrels'', Adam Miller, and the show's head puppeteer, Andy Heath, when they worked on [[ITV]] children's show ''[[Ripley and Scuff]]''.<ref name="Telegraph"/>

Miller described ''Mongrels'' as: "an adult sitcom, trying to do for puppetry what American shows like ''[[The Simpsons]]'' have done for [[animation]]. Obviously that's aiming very high. Think [stage musical] ''[[Avenue Q]]'' meets ''[[Family Guy]]'' but with puppet animals."<ref name="Telegraph"/> He also said that: "We wanted to make something that had the pace of an American animation but with British sensibilities, that was adult, but not crude, that was based in the realities of the animal world, and that didn't rely on the puppets to do the comedy."<ref name="BBC Blog">{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Adam|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/2010/06/puppets-sex-and-paul-kaye-the.shtml|title=Puppets, sex and Paul Kaye: The birth of Mongrels|publisher=BBC TV Blog|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref>

The original idea, known as ''The Un-Natural World'' was of an urban fox living in [[Brixton]] called Nelson, who was so used to living in the city that he had lost any sense of being an animal. It also featured a cat, Marion, who was trying to encourage Nelson to be more animal-like.<ref name="DVD">{{cite video|people=Miller, Adam|title=Mongrels Series 1: Interview with Adam Miller|medium=DVD|publisher=[[BBC]] and [[2entertain]]|isbn=5-051561-032110|date=16 August 2010}}</ref>

While Miller was working on BBC Three sitcom ''[[Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps]]'' he pitched the idea to producer Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum told him it was best to set the series in a single place rather than have the characters move from one place to another. McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them.<ref name="DVD"/> After reading the new script, another ''Two Pints'' writer, Jon Brown came in to write new scripts. At this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not be dressed in clothes unless it was in a flashback sequence or a during song.<ref name="Uncovered">{{Cite episode|title=Mongrels Uncovered|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tf1zy|series=Mongrels|network=[[BBC Three]]|airdate=11 August 2010|seriesno=1|number=9}}</ref>

The new script was then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made was based on the same pitch used by ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when ''The Muppet Show'' did it , "it just must have just knocked the socks off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke", so we did our own very British version of that."<ref name="DVD"/> The producers liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Millar did not want to make the show too [[Off-color humor|crude]]. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.<ref name="DVD"/>

===Character development===
When writing for the commissioned series began, the character of Nelson was originally depicted as being brash and obnoxious. This was later was changed to make him more metrosexual, [[middle class]] and likeable.<ref name="Uncovered"/> Developing the character of Destiny, Nelson's love interest, was a challenge to the programme makers. Kali was created to be a villain, with Millar describing her as a "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]-figure". Vince was partly based on the brash version of Nelson.<ref name="DVD"/>

In the unbroadcast pilot ''We Are Mongrels'', another character was included called Debbie. Debbie was a [[Suicide crisis|suicidal]] [[chicken]] who never left her [[chicken coop|coop]]. However, it was decided that the character did not go anywhere and could not be sustained for a full series, so the character was axed.<ref name="Uncovered"/> Another chicken character called Wendy appeared in the first broadcast episode as a reference to Debbie.<ref>{{cite video|people=Iestyn Evans, Daniel Peak, Dan Tetsell|title=Mongrels: Series 1: "Nelson the Online Predator" (Audio Commentary)|medium=DVD|publisher=2Entertain|isbn=5-051561-032110|date=16 August 2010}}</ref> Both characters had the same voice actress, [[Ruth Bratt]], who performed Wendy's voice in exactly the same manner as that of Debbie.<ref>{{Cite episode| title = We Are Mongrels (Pilot) | episodelink  = | url = http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mongrels/episodes/0/1/| series = Mongrels | network = BBC | station = [[BBC Three]] | city = London | seriesno = 0 | number = 1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode| title = Nelson the Online Predator | episodelink  = | url = http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mongrels/episodes/1/1/| series = Mongrels | network = BBC | station = [[BBC Three]] | city = London | airdate = 22 June 2010 | seriesno = 1 | number = 1}}</ref>

===Casting===
Rufus Jones was the first person offered to play the role of Nelson. After several other auditions with other actors, Jones was called upon to play the part.<ref name="Uncovered"/> Paul Kaye at one time provided the voice for Nelson before taking the role of Vince.<ref name="BBC Blog"/>

It was then decided by the creators to make Marion a foreign character and to find a accent that reflected this. There was discussion about [[Iran]]ian-British comic [[Omid Djalili]] playing the role. In the end, Tetsell was cast after auditioning with a poor version of Djalili's Iranian accent. Tetsell describes the voice as a mixture of, "every [[accent]] on the planet", but with the joke that Marion was meant to be a [[Persian (cat)|Persian cat]].<ref name="Uncovered"/>

===Puppets===
When the puppet for Marion was first created, he was depicted as having stripy fur, but looked more like a mouse in the eyes of the crew, so his puppet was changed. Marion's image was based on topless photos of the comic actor [[James Corden]].<ref name="Uncovered"/>

The show's puppeteers claim there are different problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion spends much of his time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.<ref name="Uncovered"/>

===Recording===
The show was originally entitled ''We Are Mongrels'', but the title had to be changed for two reasons: one was that the title was too similar to another BBC Three comedy show, ''[[We Are Klang]]''. The other is that none of the characters were [[Mixed breed|mongrels]]. Therefore new suggestions were called for. Rejected titles included ''I, Nelson''; ''Humans! Everywhere!''; ''The Garden Gang''; ''Undergrowth'' and ''Never Been Stroked''. The last of these titles was rejected after one of the show's additional writers, [[Danielle Ward]]; "said it sounded like 'a makeover show for virgins'." During this time the crew referred to the show as ''Mongrels'' and it eventually became the show's title.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peak|first=Daniel|coauthors=Thair, David|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/comedy/2010/07/we-are-not-mongrels.shtml|title=We Are Not Mongrels|publisher=BBC Comedy Blog|date=13 July 2010|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>

When writing for Vince the writers blanked out all of the characters swearing like it is done on the show, but when it came to recording the programme the swear words had to be put in for Kaye to read them. During read-throughs of the scripts, a toy horn was honked whenever Kaye swore to give an idea of what it would sound like during the programme.<ref name="Uncovered"/>

==Reception==
''Mongrels'' has been given mixed reviews. The main comments have been that most of the jokes work, but some are in poor taste. A reviewer for tvBite.com said that the show was "a bit hit and miss" but also that, "the hits are genuinely funny and even the laugh-free moments have a well-written sheen. Time and effort have been spent on the jokes <U+2013> and it shows."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvbite.com/mailouts/22062010.html|title=Tuesday: Puppet away, spamfilter issues and a competition (22/06/2010)|publisher=tvBite.com|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>

Jane Simon of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' wrote: "While most of it is very funny, some of the gags about [[Harold Shipman]] completely misjudge the tone. Maybe the age group BBC3 is aimed at reckon anything is fair game for comedy. Have a word please, someone."<ref>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Jane|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv-entertainment/tv/todays-tv/2010/06/22/mongrels-bbc3-10pm-115875-22349853/|title=Mongrels, BBC3, 10pm|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror]]''|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>

''[[The Independent]]'''s [[Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|Tom Sutcliffe]] said that: "It does have its laughs, though, because the script isn't entirely about crass shock value", but that the sitcom, while aimed at adults, is "not really for grown-ups."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sutcliffe|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Sutcliffe (broadcaster)|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-tv--the-biology-of-dads-bbc4-tribal-wives-bbc2-mongrels-bbc3-2007622.html|title=Last Night's TV - The Biology of Dads, BBC4; Tribal Wives, BBC2; Mongrels, BBC3|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>

Sam Wollaston of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was mainly positive about ''Mongrels'', but said that the main reason he thought it was funny was because it depicted "cuddly children's toys [...] saying things you wouldn't normally expect cuddly children's toys to say. Like 'You are such a cock-end'", and that, "the novelty will wear off at some point not too far away".<ref>{{cite news|last=Wollaston|first=Sam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/jun/23/biology-of-dads-tv-review|title=Last night's TV: The Biology of Dads, Mongrels and Special 1 TV|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>

According to [[BARB]] the average ratings for each episode was around 300,000 viewers.<ref name="Ratings"/>

==Awards and nominations==
''Mongrels'' won the [[Royal Television Society]] Craft and Design Award 2009-2010 for "Production Design - Entertainment and Non-Drama" led by [[production designer]] Simon Rogers. It was also nominated for the award for "Tape and Film Editing - Entertainment and Situation Comedy" led by [[Film editing|film editor]] Nigel Williams, but lost to ''[[Pete versus Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rts.org.uk/Info_page_two_pic_2_det.asp?art_id=8409&sec_id=3924|title=RTS Craft and Design Winners 2009 - 2010|publisher=[[Royal Television Society]]|date=24 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.flayrah.com/3347/mongrels-wins-rts-craft-and-design-award|title='Mongrels' wins RTS Craft and Design Award|publisher=Flayrah|date=25 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref>

==Plagiarism accusations==
''Mongrels'' has attracted anger from [[production company]] Fit2Fill which claimed the BBC "ripped off" their 2001 Channel 4 sitcom ''Pets''. Fit2Fill claimed they received 30 emails from people saying the series were similar, and they once pitched the idea of ''Pets'' to then BBC head of comedy Mark Freeland, who also acted as the executive producer of ''Mongrels''.<ref name="Chortle"/>

The producer of ''Pets'', Andrew Barclay said: "We checked the BBC's ''Mongrels'' website this morning and the Beeb do appear to have hired the same puppet builders and puppeteers as ''Pets''. We also notice that ''Mongrels''' executive producer is Mark Freeland, to whom we did once pitch a ''Pets'' follow-up show."<ref name="Chortle"/>

Comments have been made with regards to the plotlines of some episodes and the similarities between characters. For example, it is claimed that "Both shows feature a conflict between a foul-mouthed character and a more posh character (Nelson and Vince in ''Mongrels'', Hamish and Trevor in ''Pets'')", that "Both shows feature an idiotic character (Marion in ''Mongrels'', JP in ''Pets'')", and "Both shows feature a self-absorbed female character (Destiny in ''Mongrels'', Davina in ''Pets'')."<ref name="BCG News">{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000328/mongrels_pets_plagiarism/|title=BBC3's Mongrels accused of plagiarising C4 sitcom Pets|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=25 June 2010|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

The co-creator and co-producer of ''Pets'', Brian West, went on to post his views on a BBC blog post about ''Mongrels''. Following this, a telephone conversation between West and ''Mongrels'' producer McCrum took place where McCrum, "claimed that no-one from the BBC production team had watched ''Pets'' before or during the development and production of their series." From this West responded that: "We might therefore conclude that any similarities between the two shows is 100% coincidental." West left people to judge for themselves whether ''Pets'' had been copied.<ref name="BCG News"/>

Afterwards, Andy Heath, a puppet builder who worked for both ''Mongrels'' and ''Pets'', said on the same blog that he met Adam Miller in 2002 after he [Heath] finished working on ''Pets'' in 2000, to work on ''Ripley and Scuff''. Miller then began developing the idea for ''Mongrels'' in 2004. Heath then went onto say:

<blockquote>"''Pets'' was ''Pets''. ''Mongrels'' is ''Mongrels''. If, as a viewer, you can sit down and say they are the same, then there is little point of making any new shows, if the slightest similarity (puppets and animals) can be suggested as idea stealing. I am surprised [[Basil Brush]] hasn't been on the blower, as he is a fox, and that must be a copy! Right? I worked on both, and know for a fact where they both come from. Two very different ideas."<ref name="BCG News"/></blockquote>

==Merchandise==
The first series of ''Mongrels'' was released on [[DVD]] ([[DVD region code|region 2 and 4]]) and [[Blu-ray disc]] (region 2) on 16 August 2010. The DVD and Blu-ray discs featured the unbroadcast pilot amongst their extras.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/mongrels/buy/|title=Mongrels - Merchandise|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=9 September 2010}}</ref>
