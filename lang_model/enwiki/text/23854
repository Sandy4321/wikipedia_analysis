'''SMS ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi''''' was a [[Radetzky class battleship|''Radetzky''-class pre-dreadnought battleship]] (''Schlachtschiff'') of the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Navy (''K.u.K. Kriegsmarine''), named for  the [[Zrinski|Zrinyis]], a noble [[Hungary|Hungarian]] family of [[Croatia]]n origin.  She was later briefly designated USS ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' of the [[United States Navy]] following [[World War I]]. Zrinyi and her sisters, {{SMS|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand||2}} and {{SMS|Radetzky||2}}, were the last [[pre-dreadnought]]s built by the Austro-Hungarian Navy.

Her keel was laid down on 15 November 1908, at the ''Stabilimento Tecnico'' of [[Trieste]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 April 1910, and completed in July 1911.

During World War I, ''Zrinyi'' saw action in the Adriatic sea. She served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's [[battleship]]s and took part in the bombardment of [[Senigallia]] as well as the bombardment of the key seaport of [[Ancona, Italy]], on 24 May 1915. However, [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] control of the [[Strait of Otranto]] meant that the Austro-Hungarian Navy was, for all intents and purposes, effectively bottled up in the [[Adriatic]]. Nonetheless, the presence of the ''Zrinyi'' and other battleships tied down a substantial force of Allied ships.

==Construction==
{{main|Radetzky class battleship}}
[[Image:Klasa radetzky.png|thumb|left|Plan of SMS ''Radetzky'', a ship that was almost identical to the SMS ''Zrinyi''.|alt= Illustration of this type of vessel; the ship carried two large gun turrets on either end and four smaller turrets arranged around two tall smoke stacks in the center.]]
''Zrinyi'' was built at the [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] dockyard in [[Triest]], the same place where her sisterships were built earlier. She was launched from the slipway on September 8, 1908.<ref name=Conways333>Gardiner & Gray, p. 333</ref> The [[teak]] used on the ship's deck was the only material Austria-Hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship.<ref name=S211>Sondhaus, p. 211</ref>  The ship was completed by July 15, 1911, when she was commissioned into the fleet.<ref name=Conways333/> She was the last ship of the class to be completed; ''Radetzky'' followed eight months earlier on 15 January 1911, and ''Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand'' exactly six months before that, on 10 June.<ref name=Conways333/>

''Zrinyi'' was 138.8&nbsp;m (455&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in) long, and had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of 24.6&nbsp;m (80&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in) and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of 8.1&nbsp;m (26&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in). She displaced {{convert|14508|LT}} normally, and up to {{convert|15845.5|LT}} with a full combat load. The ship was powered by two-shaft four-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s rated at 19,800&nbsp;[[indicated horsepower]] and a top speed of {{convert|20.5|kn}}.<ref name= jane>Ireland, p. 12</ref> ''Zrinyi'' was the first warship in the Austro-Hungarian navy to use oil to supplement the coal fired boilers.<ref name=S211/> She had a maximum range of {{convert|4000|nmi|abbr=on}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|kn|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Conways333/>

The ship's primary armament consisted of four 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) 45-[[Caliber#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|caliber]] guns in two twin [[gun turret]]s.<ref name= jane/> This was augmented by a heavy secondary battery of eight 24&nbsp;cm (9.4&nbsp;in) guns in four wing turrets.<ref name= jane/> The tertiary battery consisted of twenty 10&nbsp;cm L/50 guns in [[casemate]] single mounts, two 66&nbsp;mm (2.6&nbsp;in) landing guns, four 47&nbsp;mm (1.85&nbsp;in) L/44 and one 47&nbsp;mm L/33 quick-firing guns.<ref name= jane/> Three 45&nbsp;cm (17.7&nbsp;in) torpedo tubes were also carried, two on the beams and one in the stern.<ref name=Conways333/>

==Service history==
===Pre-war===
In 1912, ''Zrinyi'' took part in a training cruise with the recently commissioned [[dreadnought]]s {{SMS|Tegetthoff||2}} and {{SMS|Viribus Unitis||2}} in the eastern Mediterranean, which included a stop at [[Malta]]. Zrinyi and her sisterships were assigned to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, alongside the ''Tegetthoff'' ships in the 1st Division.<ref name=Conways332>Gardiner and Gray, p. 332</ref>

===World War I===
During [[World War I]], ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' served with the Second Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's [[battleship]]s and along with her sisterships {{SMS|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand||2}} and {{SMS|Radetzky||2}} and the remainder of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, ''Zrinyi'' was mobilized on the eve of World War I to support the flight of {{SMS|Goeben}} and {{SMS|Breslau||2}}. The two German were ships stationed in the Mediterranean and were attempting to break out of the strait of [[Messina]], which was surrounded by British troops and vessels and make their way to Turkey. After the Germans successfully broke out of Messina, the navy was recalled. The fleet had by that time advanced as far south as [[Brindisi]] in south eastern Italy.<ref>Haplern p. 54</ref> 

On May 24, 1915, ''Zrinyi'' and her sister ships bombarded the Italian coast, mainly the important naval base at [[Ancona]]. This occurred several days after the entrance of Italy into the war on the side of the [[Triple Entente]].<ref name="Zrinyi">{{cite web| title =Zrinyi| url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/z1/zrinyi.htm| publisher = USN Historical Center| date = | accessdate = 8 September 2009}}</ref>  The Italian fleet was completely unprepared for hostilities, and by the time Italian ships arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in [[Pula|Pola]] where they would remain until the conclusion of the war.<ref>Miller, p. 396</ref><ref name= Hore/>

===Postwar fate===
After the [[Habsburg Empire]] collapsed in 1918, the [[Austria]]ns wanted to turn the fleet over to the newly-created [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] (later to become the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) in order to prevent the Italians from getting their hands on the ships.<ref name="Zrinyi"/> However, the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south Slavs and, in due course, reallocated the ships.<ref name="Zrinyi"/>. The ship had been boraded with a scratch Yugoslav crew on November 10, 1918, one day before the Armistice, and had left [[Pula|Pola]] with her sistership, ''Radetszky''. They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships, so the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the [[Adriatic]] coast to [[Castelli Bay]] near [[Split (city)|Spolato]]. They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of USN submarine chasers in the area did.<ref name=Hore>{{cite book |last=Hore|first=Peter|title=Battleships of World War I|year=2006|location=[[London]]|publisher=Southwater Books|isbn=978-1-84476-377-1}}</ref> ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south Slav state, as it was a Croat naval officer, ''Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n'' Marijan Poli<U+0107>, who turned over the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the [[United States Navy]] on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato (also known as [[Split (city)|Split]]) in [[Dalmatia]].<ref name="Zrinyi"/>  Simultaneously she was commissioned as USS ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' and Lieutenant E.E. Hazlett, USN, assumed command.<ref name="Zrinyi"/> The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men <U+2014> the latter entirely composed of [[United States Navy Reserve]] Force personnel.<ref name="Zrinyi"/> ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' remained at anchor at Spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on.<ref name="Zrinyi"/> Only once did she apparently turn her engines over, and that occurred during a severe gale that struck Spalato on 9 February 1920.<ref name="Zrinyi"/>

On the morning of 7 November 1920, ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' was decommissioned.<ref name="Zrinyi"/> {{USS|Chattanooga|CL-18|6}} took her in tow and, assisted by {{USS|Brooks|DD-232|2}} and {{USS|Hovey|DD-208|2}}, pulled the battleship to [[Papaja, Italy]].<ref name="Zrinyi"/> Under the terms of the treaties of [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Treaty of St. Germain|St. Germain]], ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' was ultimately turned over to the [[Italy|Italian]] government at [[Venice]]. ''Zr<U+00ED>nyi'' was later broken up for scrap.
