The song's producer RedOne originally leaked the song onto his official [[YouTube]] channel, which was followed by an ability to stream the song in its entirety on Black's official website. An [[Extended play|EP]] containing three remixes of "Naughty Naughty" was released on through iTunes on February 21, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naughty Naughty (The Remixes) - Single|url=http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/naughty-naughty-remixes-single/id502238928|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref>

"Naughty Naughty" was accompanied by an online viral music video labeled "Unofficial Music Video" following its release, with promises from Black to shoot an official music video in the near future. "Naughty Naughty" debuted at number 46 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], peaking at number six after several weeks, outperforming Black's [[This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like|lead single]] and becoming her most successful single at the time.

==Background and release==
"Naughty Naughty", the follow-up to Black's debut single "[[This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like]]", features writing by Porcelain Black, herself, Nadir "RedOne" Khayat, who also produced the track, and additional writing from Bilal Hajji and Luxe Noir. Originally titled "LaaDeeDaaDee," the song was set to [[Sampling (music)|sample]] the 1985 song "[[La Di Da Di]]" performed by [[Doug E. Fresh]] and [[Slick Rick|MC Ricky D]].<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Porcelain+Black/_/LaaDeeDaaDee Porcelain Black <U+2013> LaaDeeDaaDee <U+2013> Listening & stats at Last.fm<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For unknown reasons, the sample was excluded for the track's official release, renamed "Naughty Naughty".

==Composition==
{{listen |filename=Naughty Naughty sample.ogg |title="Naughty Naughty" |description=A 22 second sample of the song's chorus, where Black's intense vocals match the grit of the song's electric guitar.|pos=left |format=[[Ogg]]}}
"Naughty Naughty" plays up the bad-girl image of the middle finger-waving singer from 8 Mile in Detroit.<ref name=popcrush2/> "Naughty Naughty' gives straight attitude and rock & roll grunge with lyrics like 'Definitely kissing a stranger/ then leave his ass later, you know/ Can't help that I'm attracted to danger/ You can't be my savior, uh oh.' <ref>{{cite web|title=Porcelain Black Is "Naughty Naughty" (NEW MUSIC)|url=http://globalgrind.com/music/porcelain-black-naughty-naughty-new-music|publisher=Global Grind|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref> Lyrically, Black acknowledges that she<U+2019>s not as scary as she may seem as she sings "Definitely not an angel / But I<U+2019>m not that evil, you know."<ref name=popcrush2/>

"Naughty Naughty" was compared as more mainstream dance-pop and danceable than her previous material.<ref name=popcrush2/> Instrumentally, the song features RedOne setting the track stomping; [[synth]]s subside only briefly, and the percussion never lets up.<ref name=popdust/> Asaph of ''PopDust'' noted a striking similarity between Black's intense vocals and the synthesized electric guitar used in the song, forming enough "grit" to scrape out a cross between a [[Screaming (music)|scream]], choking and an extended glottal stop by the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]].<ref name=popdust/> Vocally, Black sings about being naughty, in a quick and graceful manor; when she sings about losing control, the [[reverb]]'s meticulous and the [[Auto-Tune]] sleek and flawless.<ref name=popdust/>

==Reception==
{{double image|left|FFT26.jpg|125|Gaga-monster ball UK DITD.jpg|150|Critics noted that the song's dance-pop genre change comes off like a slightly edgier [[Britney Spears]] (left) song. The song also gained comparisons to tracks from Lady Gaga's (right) ''Born This Way'' (2011).<ref name=prophet/>}}
===Critical reception===
"Naughty Naughty" garnered mixed reviews from critics, most of whom commented on the song's ability to "[[This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like|look like rock and roll]]," referencing her debut single. Scott Shelter of Pop Crush gave the song a positive review, noting Black's rough exterior and how it compares to the song's lyrics which acknowledge that "she<U+2019>s not as scary as she may seem".<ref name=popcrush2>{{cite web|last=Shelter|first=Scott|title=Porcelain Black, <U+2018>Naughty Naughty<U+2019> <U+2013> Song Review|url=http://popcrush.com/porcelain-black-naughty-naughty/|publisher=Pop Crush|date= 20 September 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref> Shelter went on to say the single was a step forward from "[[This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like]]", Black's first single, complimenting the song as "mainstream dance-pop" and "totally danceable", later ending his review by awarding the song three-and-a-half stars out of five.<ref name=popcrush2/>

Describing the song as an edgy underground rock anthem, The Prophet Blog reviewed the song as a rejected ''[[Born This Way]]'' (2011) submission which was traded in for a song like <U+201C>[[Judas (Lady Gaga song)|Judas]]<U+201D>.<ref name=prophet>{{cite web|title=Listen Queen of Rock Porcelain Black returns with "Naughty Naughty"|url=http://www.theprophetblog.net/listen-queen-of-rock-porcelain-black-returns-with-naughty-naughty|publisher=The Prophet Blog|date= 18 September 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref> Although a negative review, The Prophet Blog went on to say that the song is bad, "in a semi-good way", referencing the songs catchy lyrics "Naughty Naughty Naughty we like to party / I know you hate it coz we flirt with everybody! Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh!"<ref name=prophet/>Katherine St Asaph of ''PopDust'' agreed with the [[Lady Gaga]] comparison originally reviewed by ''The Prophet Blog'', stating that the song does not look like rock 'n' roll before rating the song two-out-of-five "lightning bolts".<ref name=popdust>{{cite web|author=Katherine St Asaph |url=http://popdust.com/2011/09/19/porcelain-black-naughty-naughty-review/|title=The Singles Bar: Porcelain Black, <U+201C>Naughty Naughty<U+201D>|publisher=Popdust |date=2011-09-19 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref>
