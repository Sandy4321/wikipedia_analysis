'''''Val<U+00E9>rian and Laureline''''' ([[French language|French]]: '''''Val<U+00E9>rian et Laureline'''''), also known as '''''Val<U+00E9>rian: Spatio-Temporal Agent''''' (French: '''''Val<U+00E9>rian: Agent Spatio-Temporel''''') or just '''''Val<U+00E9>rian''''', is a [[France|French]] [[comic book]] [[science fiction]] series created by writer [[Pierre Christin]] and artist [[Jean-Claude M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res]]. It belongs to the rich family of [[Franco-Belgian comics]].

The series centres around the adventures of the [[Spacetime|spatio-temporal]] agent, Val<U+00E9>rian, and his redheaded female companion, Laureline, as they travel the universe through space and time. Val<U+00E9>rian is a classical [[anti-hero]], strong and brave but with a tendency to follow the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that it is the wrong thing to do. On the other hand, his companion Laureline manages to combine sex-appeal with intelligence and independence making her one of science fiction's most notable heroines. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series combines elements of [[space opera]] and [[time travel]]. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour and strongly [[liberalism|liberal]] political slant while M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res' art is noted for its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Val<U+00E9>rian and Laureline encounter on their adventures.

''Val<U+00E9>rian'' first appeared on [[November 9]], [[1967]] in issue #420 of ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine,<ref name="BDO-pilote67">{{cite web | url =http://bdoubliees.com/journalpilote/annees/1967.htm | title =Le journal Pilote en 1967 | work =BDoubli<U+00E9>es | accessdate =2007-03-22 | language = French }}</ref> and continues today with the latest installment published in 2007. All of the ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' stories have been collected in [[graphic novel]] album format comprising some twenty-one volumes plus a [[short story]] collection and an [[encyclopaedia]]. ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' is one of the top five biggest selling titles of its publisher, [[Dargaud]].<ref name="CJ#260">{{cite journal | last = Kane | first = Gil | authorlink = Gil Kane | coauthors = Groth, Gary | year = 2004 | month = May/June | title = Recognition: A Conversation with Jean-Claude M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res | journal = The Comics Journal | issue = 260 | pages = 88-112 | publisher = Fantagraphics Books | id = ISSN 0194-7869 }}

''Val<U+00E9>rian'' has proven to be influential on a number of comics artists as well as on several science fiction and fantasy films, including ''[[Star Wars]]''. Jean-Claude M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res worked as a concept artist on [[Luc Besson]]'s ''[[The Fifth Element]]'' and the ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' album ''[[The Circles of Power]]'' influenced the futuristic [[New York City]] with its flying taxi cabs seen in that film.

An [[animation|animated]] television adaptation, titled ''[[Time Jam: Valerian & Laureline]]'', has been made and is currently airing on [[Canal+]] Family in France.

==Concept and setting==
The original setting for the series was the [[28th century]]. Humanity has discovered the means of travelling instantaneously in time and space. The capital of Earth, ''Galaxity'', is the centre of the vast ''Terran Galactic Empire''. Earth itself has become a virtual [[utopia]] with most of the population living a life of leisure in a [[virtual reality]] dream-state while ruled by the benign ''[[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|Technocrats]] of the First Circle''. The ''Spatio-Temporal Service'' protects the planets of the Terran Empire and guards against [[temporal paradox]]es caused by rogue time-travellers. Val<U+00E9>rian and Laureline are two such spatio-temporal agents.<ref name="Bad Dreams">

In the first two albums Val<U+00E9>rian travels through time in a two-seater device, the ''XB27'', which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in ''[[Bad Dreams]]'' (''Les Mauvais R<U+00EA>ves'') the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Val<U+00E9>rian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship ''XB982'' (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story ''[[Across the Pathways of Space#The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur)|The Great Collector]]'' (''Le Grand Collectionneur'')).<ref>

==Principal characters==
===Val<U+00E9>rian===
Val<U+00E9>rian ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Ravian; [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] & [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Valentin) was born on Earth, in Galaxity, capital of the Terran Galactic Empire in the 28th century. He joined the Spatio-Temporal Service in the year 2713. He has been trained to think that Galaxity is always right and even when he receives orders that go against his sense of right he will, reluctantly, follow them. He much prefers to be a man of action than sitting around pondering what course to take next.

Initially, the early stories present Val<U+00E9>rian as a typical square-jawed [[hero]] figure, who is strong and dependable (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, especially when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In ''[[World Without Stars]]'' (''Le Pays sans Etoiles''),<ref name="World Without Stars">

</ref> Val<U+00E9>rian was created by M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res and Christin as a reaction to the fearless boy-scout (e.g. [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]) and American [[superhero]] characters that were prevalent in comics available in France at the time. Instead they sought to devise a <U+201C>banal character<U+201D> with <U+201C>no extraordinary means of action<U+201D>.<ref name="CJ#129" />  Eventually, with Christin feeling that they had gone too far with this angle and that the Val<U+00E9>rian character had become too stupid, from ''[[The Ghosts of Inverloch]]'' (''Les Spectres d'Inverloch'') onwards, Val<U+00E9>rian was made more sympathetic and given a greater slice of the action.<ref name="CJ#129" />

===Laureline===
Laureline ([[German language|German]]: Veronique; [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] & [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Linda) is a peasant girl from [[11th century]] France who rescues Val<U+00E9>rian from the enchanted Forest of Arelaune in the debut adventure ''Bad Dreams''.<ref name="Bad Dreams" /> When she accidentally discovers Val<U+00E9>rian is a time-traveller, he is forced to bring her back with him to Galaxity where she is trained as a Spatio-Temporal Agent and assigned as his partner.

In the early stories Laureline generally sits in the background while Val<U+00E9>rian saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves in. However, as the series develops, Laureline's position begins to change. ''World Without Stars'', in which the two characters are separated for most of the adventure, allows Laureline to step out from under Val<U+00E9>rian's shadow for the first time and she proves to be more than an equal to Val<U+00E9>rian in ensuring that their mission succeeds.<ref name="World Without Stars" />

''[[Welcome to Alflolol]]'' (''Bienvenue sur Alflolol'') brings Laureline's rebellious nature to the fore; unlike Val<U+00E9>rian she has not been born and raised by Galaxity and is prepared to not only question their authority but openly rebel against them when their orders run contrary to her sense of morality.<ref name="Welcome to Alflolol">

</ref> It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Val<U+00E9>rian with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself. Her position as the true star of the series is cemented in ''[[Ambassador of the Shadows]]'' (''L'Ambassadeur des Ombres'') which is virtually a solo adventure for her as she searches the vast space station Point Central for the kidnapped Val<U+00E9>rian and the Earth Ambassador.<ref name="Ambassador of the Shadows">

Despite being independent and efficacious Laureline is not afraid to exploit her considerable sex appeal if it is to her advantage. For example, she attracts the attention of the Emperor of Valsennar in ''World Without Stars''<ref name="World Without Stars" /> while she manipulates Crocbattler and Rackalust in ''Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos''<ref name="Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos" /> and regularly charms the [[#Shingouz|Shingouz]] when negotiating with them for information.

The name <U+201C>Laureline<U+201D> was invented by M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res and Christin who were seeking a name that would sound <U+201C>medieval<U+201D> and <U+201C>soft<U+201D>.<ref name="DBD" /> The name has proven popular and there are now several thousand women in France who bear the name Laureline, the first one born in 1968 just a year after the publication of ''Bad Dreams''. There have also been variations such as <U+201C>Loreline<U+201D> and <U+201C>Laurelyne<U+201D>.<ref>

</ref> He is a retired gentleman who drives a [[Renault 4CV]] and lives in the [[suburb]]s of [[Paris]], [[France]]. He maintains a wide range of contacts in government and scientific circles as well as with many experts in fields outside the mainstream such as [[UFOlogy]], [[telepathy]], and [[sorcery]]. He is also a [[pigeon keeping|pigeon fancier]] and uses his [[carrier pigeon]]s to relay messages between some of his contacts. Unlike Val<U+00E9>rian he tries to avoid getting involved in the thick of the action and never acts impulsively, always preferring to take his time about things. He enjoys the finer things in life: gourmet cuisine, fine wines and likes to take things easy.

The character of Albert is partially influenced by that of August Faust, the main character in the strip ''The Extraordinary and Troubling Adventure of Mr August Faust'' (''L'extraordinaire et Troublante Aventure de M. August Faust''), written by [[Fred (comics)|Fred]] and drawn by M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res in [[1967]].<ref name = "DBD" /> {{clr}}

The Shingouz are aliens who make their first appearance in ''Ambassador of the Shadows'' and re-appear regularly throughout the subsequent albums.

Shingouz have an extremely high tolerance and preference for strong [[alcoholic beverage]]s, which they consume in large quantities.  The Shingouz society is [[capitalism|capitalist]] to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They are especially adept in trading important and sensitive [[information]] to interested parties.  Val<U+00E9>rian and Laureline have struck up a relationship with a group of three Shingouz who have a particularly usefull network of contacts in all the major space communities. They are especially fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.<ref>

Childhood friends Jean-Claude M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res and Pierre Christin had previously collaborated on the comic strip ''Le Rhum du Punch'' (''Rum Punch'') in 1966 while both were living and working in the [[USA]].<ref name="DBD" />  Upon their return to France they initially intended to create a [[Western (genre)|Western]] strip but, with the genre already well represented in French comics thanks to ''[[Lucky Luke]]'', ''[[Blueberry (comics)|Blueberry]]'' and ''[[Jerry Spring]]'', Christin instead proposed that they turn their hand to science fiction, a genre he felt was unrepresented in French comics at the time.<ref name="CJ#129" />  The decision to work in the science fiction genre was also influenced by the political climate in France at the time; M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res and Christin saw ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' as a <U+201C>backdoor<U+201D> means to react against the prevailing doctrine of [[Gaullism]].<ref name="CJ#129" /> Although science fiction was not a favourite of ''Pilote'' editor [[Ren<U+00E9> Goscinny]], Goscinny wanted his magazine to be seen to be diverse and innovative and so agreed to commission ''Val<U+00E9>rian''.<ref name="DBD" />

There had been French science fiction comics before ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' such as Kline's ''Kaza the Martian'' (a childhood favourite of M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res),<ref name="DBD" /> Roger Lecureux and [[Raymond Poivet]]'s ''Les Pionniers de l'Esp<U+00E9>rance'' ''(The Pioneers of Hope)'' (which Christin found tired and repetitive)<ref name="CJ#129" /> and [[Jean-Claude Forest]]'s ''[[Barbarella (comic book)|Barbarella]]''.  ''Barbarella'' is famous for its strong, female, titular character but Christin has denied any influence on the character of Laureline stating that she was inspired by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[The Second Sex]]'' as well as the burgeoning feminist movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name="ABC">

Christin has also cited the [[Whodunit]] genre <U+2014> notably novels by [[Georges Simenon]] and [[Ed McBain]] <U+2014> as an influence on ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' since they taught him, as a writer, that all characters in a narrative must be seen to have motivations.<ref name="ABC" />  

M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res' drawings in the early albums were influenced by such <U+201C>[[Franco-Belgian_comics#.22Comic-Dynamic.22_style|comic-dynamic]]<U+201D> artists as [[Morris (comics)|Morris]] (''Lucky Luke''), [[Andr<U+00E9> Franquin]] (''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'') and [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] ([[Mad magazine]]),<ref name="U#23" /> leading to Jean-Pierre Andrevon to refer to ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' as <U+201C>a kind of ''Lucky Luke'' of space-time<U+201D>.<ref name="Andrevon_1970" />  As the series progressed, M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res developed a more realistic style, akin to that of [[Jij<U+00E9>]], though in more recent albums he has returned to the more cartoonish style of the earlier stories.<ref name="U#23" />

==Legacy==
===In comics===
''Val<U+00E9>rian's'' arrival on the French comics scene was contemporaneous with the debuts of other notable French science fiction strips including ''[[Luc Orient]]'' by [[Michel Regnier|Greg]] and [[Eddy Paape]] and ''[[Lone Sloane]]'' by [[Philippe Druillet]].<ref name="U#23" /><ref name="Shadowmen2">

Both series are noted for the <U+201C>lived-in<U+201D> look given to their various settings and for the diverse alien creatures they feature. Particular instances of similarities between the two series, which the above have cited, include:
* The design of Val<U+00E9>rian and Laureline's XB982 astroship and the [[Millennium Falcon]] spaceship that appears in Episodes IV-VI of ''Star Wars''.
* A scene in ''[[Empire of a Thousand Planets]]'' (''L'Empire des Mille Plan<U+00E8>tes'') where Val<U+00E9>rian is encased in a liquid plastic and a scene in ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' where the character [[Han Solo]] is encased in a substance called [[carbonite]].
* The slave-girl costume worn by Laureline in ''World Without Stars'' and the costume worn by the character [[Leia Organa]] in the scenes where she is enslaved by [[Jabba the Hutt]] in ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]''
* A scene in ''Empire of a Thousand Planets'' where one of the Authorities removes his helmet to reveal his burned and scarred face underneath and a scene in ''Return of the Jedi'' where the character [[Darth Vader]] removes his helmet to reveal the burned face of [[Anakin Skywalker]].
* The alien Shingouz and the character [[Watto]] seen in ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''.

M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res has also noticed similarities between some of the sets in the [[1982]] film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and the planet seen in ''[[Birds of the Master]]'' (''Les Oiseaux du Ma<U+00EE>tre'') and between some of the production sketches for the alien fighters in the [[1996]] film ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'' and Val<U+00E9>rian and Laureline's astroship.<ref name="DBD" />

Jean-Claude M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res himself has worked as a concept artist on a number of science fiction film projects.  The first of these was in [[1984]] for director [[Jeremy Kagan]] who was attempting to adapt [[Ren<U+00E9> Barjavel]]'s novel ''[[La Nuit des temps]]'' (''The Ice People''). The film was never made. This was followed, in [[1985]], by a proposed adaptation of [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]'s novel ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'' for director [[Peter Fleischmann]]. This film was eventually finished in [[1989]] though M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res' concepts for the film were barely used. The art M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res produced for both projects was later published in ''M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res Extras''.<ref name="Extras#1" /><ref name="DBD" />

In [[1991]] M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res began work producing concept art for the director [[Luc Besson]] for his film ''[[The Fifth Element]]''.  When the project stalled and Besson moved on to work on the film ''[[L<U+00E9>on (film)|L<U+00E9>on]]'' in [[1994]], M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res returned to ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' for the album ''[[The Circles of Power]]'' (''Les Cercles du Pouvoir''). This featured a character, S'Traks, who drove a flying taxi around a great metropolis on the planet Rubanis.<ref>

''Heroes of the Equinox'' was republished in July 1996 in black and white by ''Fantasy Flight Publishing'' (an offshoot of ''[[Fantasy Flight Games]]'') in two issues as standard American sized [[comic-book]]s as part of an unsuccessful attempt to translate and print several European comic book series including ''[[Spirou et Fantasio]]'' and ''Lucky Luke''.<ref>

</ref> According to Animation World Network, "''Time Jam - Valerian & Laureline'' sets out to answer the question: Where on Earth has Earth gone?  Valerian and Laureline, our two young heroes, seem to be the only representatives of the human race in the unsafe galaxy where the nightmarish Vlagos are conspiring to control the world.  Sent out on an assignment by the head of STS (the Spatial-Temporal Service), Valerian and Laureline discover the existence of a time-portal, a mysterious phenomenon, which may hold the key to the recovery of Earth.  The series from Dargaud Marina mixes 2D and CGI animation with an [[anime]] touch<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite journal

The notion of making an animated adaptation of ''Val<U+00E9>rian'' dates beck to at least 1976.<ref name="DBD" /> In 1982, M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res produced concept art for an episode titled ''[[The Asteroids of Shimballil]]'' (''Les Ast<U+00E9>ro<U+00EF>des de Shimballil'') which was later published in 2000 as an appendix to the album release of ''Bad Dreams''.<ref name="Bad Dreams" /> In 1991, ''Dargaud Films'' financed the production of a three minute pilot, directed by Bernard Deyri<U+00E8>s and animated by ''Studio 32'' in [[Paris]] and [[Luxembourg]], but nothing came of this venture. Several stills from this pilot episode were published in ''M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res Extras''.<ref name="Extras#1" /> Another pilot, directed by Florient Ferrier, was made by the French animation studio 2 Minutes in 2001. Nothing came of this attempt either.<ref>
