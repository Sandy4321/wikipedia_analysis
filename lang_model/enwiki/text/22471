'''Reginald Heber''' (21 April 1783&nbsp;<U+2013> 3 April 1826) was an English [[clergyman]], [[intellectual|man of letters]] and hymn-writer who, after working as a country parson for 16 years, served as the Anglican [[Bishop of Calcutta]] until his sudden death at the age of 42.

The son of a wealthy landowner and clergyman, Heber gained an early reputation at [[Oxford University]] as a poet. After graduation he expanded his view of the world by undertaking, at the height of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], an extended tour of Scandinavia, Russia and central Europe. He was ordained in 1807 and took over his father's old parish of [[Hodnet]] in Shropshire, where he combined his pastoral duties with other church offices and literary work.  Several hymns that he wrote subsequently became staples in church hymnals for many years.

Heber took office as Bishop of Calcutta in October 1823. During his short episcopate he travelled widely in the [[Presidencies and provinces of British India#Presidencies of British India (1772<U+2013>1858)|areas of India]] within his [[diocese]], and worked hard to improve the spiritual and general living conditions of his flock.  However, a combination of arduous duties, hostile climate and indifferent health brought about his collapse and death while visiting [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichinopoly]] (now Tiruchirappalli), after less than three years in India. Monuments were erected to his memory in India and in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London. A collection of his hymns was published shortly after his death; one of these, "[[Holy, Holy, Holy]]", written for [[Trinity Sunday]], has survived into the 21st century as one of the best-known of all English hymns. Later commentators have asserted that although Heber's example and writings inspired others to devote their lives to the mission fields, the paternalism and imperial assumptions expressed in his hymns are outdated and generally unacceptable in the modern world.

==Early life==
===Background and childhood===
[[File:Drayton Road, Hodnet - geograph.org.uk - 1441690.jpg|thumb|left|Hodnet in Shropshire, where Heber spent his early years]]

The surname "Heber" is probably derived from "Haybergh", a hill in the [[Craven]] district of [[Yorkshire]] in north-eastern England, where the Heber family originated. The family held the [[Lord of the Manor|lordship of the manor]] of Marton, and was granted a [[coat of arms]] during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref name= M9>Montefiore, pp. 9<U+2013>10</ref> In 1752 Richard Heber received the manor and estate of Hodnet Hall in [[Shropshire]] as a bequest from a cousin of his wife. The bequest included [[advowson|patronage]] of the parish of [[Hodnet, Shropshire|Hodnet]]. On Richard Heber's death in 1766 his brother Reginald, who had taken [[Holy Orders]] and was co-rector of the parish of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] in Cheshire, inherited the estate and became rector of [[Hodnet, Shropshire|Hodnet]] in addition to his share of the Malpas [[Benefice#Current usage|living]].<ref>Hughes, p. 7</ref>  Reginald married twice; the first union, to Mary Baylie, produced a son, [[Richard Heber]], who became a distinguished book collector and was [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]].<ref name= Sherbo>{{cite web|last= Sherbo|first= Arthur|title= Heber, Richard (1774<U+2013>83)|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12854|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition|date= May 2005|accessdate= 28 June 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> The second marriage, after Mary Baylie's death, was to Mary Allanson; it produced two further sons, the elder of whom, born at Malpas on 21 April 1783, was named Reginald after his father.<ref name= M9/>

At the age of eight the younger Reginald began attending the local grammar school at [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]], where he remained for five years. In 1796 he was sent to Bristow's, a small private school in [[Neasden]] a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] or [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] universities.<ref name= ODNB>{{cite web|last= Laird|first= Michael|title= Heber, Reginald (1783<U+2013>1826)|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12853|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition|year= 2004|accessdate= 28 June 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend.<ref>Hughes, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>  The pair shared a lively interest in church history and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref> In October 1800 Heber entered [[Brasenose College, Oxford]];<ref>Montefiore, p. 16 (Hughes, p. 12, gives this date as November 1799)</ref> Thornton's decision to go to Cambridge was a matter for Heber's considerable regret.<ref name= Hughes12>Hughes, pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref>

===Oxford===
[[File:Brasenose College from the High Street.jpg|thumb|Brasenose College, Oxford (modern photograph)]]
There were strong family connections with Brasenose; Heber's brother Richard was at the time a [[Fellow#Academia|fellow]] of the college, and his father was a former fellow.  The Master of Brasenose was [[William Cleaver]], a close friend of Reginald senior and a frequent visitor to Hodnet Hall. In his first year at Oxford Heber acquired distinction by winning the University Prize for Latin Verse.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 16<U+2013>18</ref> He began to develop a local reputation as a [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]], and in 1803 successfully entered his long poem "Palestine" for the [[Newdigate Prize]].<ref name= M19/> He had been helped in this composition by [[Walter Scott]], a family friend, before the future novelist's years of fame.<ref name= Hughes12/> When Heber declaimed the poem at that year's [[Encaenia]] ceremony at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]], it was given an enthusiastic reception.<ref name= M19>Montefiore, p. 19 (Hughes, p. 13, wrongly states that the poem was entered for the [[Seatonian Prize]], Cambridge's equivalent to the Newdigate)</ref> The poem was later published, and was set to music by the composer [[William Crotch]],<ref name= ODNB/> who had been professor of music at Oxford since 1797.<ref>{{cite web|last= Olleson|first= Philip|title= Crotch, William (1775<U+2013>1847)|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6810|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition|year= 2004|accessdate= 29 June 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> Montefiore, writing in 1902, described the poem as "the most successful and popular piece of religious verse of the first half of the [19th] century".<ref name= M19/> A later biographer, Derrick Hughes, finds its contemporary acclaim puzzling: "It is not a good, not even a mediocre poem; it is leaden".<ref>Hughes, p. 14</ref>

In February 1804 Reginald senior died, leaving the [[Benefice|living]] of the parish of Hodnet vacant; this may have prompted Heber's own decision to seek ordination, though he delayed this for some years.<ref>Hughes, p. 15</ref> In his degree examinations he acquitted himself honourably rather than brilliantly; Montefiore quotes a contemporary's view that Heber's main contribution to university life was in fields outside formal academic success, particularly as a thinker, a poet and an orator: "Reginald Heber was a star whose lustre was as steady as it was clear".<ref>Montefiore, p. 21</ref> He took his [[bachelor's degree]] in the summer of 1804, and was elected to a fellowship of [[All Souls College, Oxford]]. He also won the University's Bachelor's Prize for an English prose essay.<ref>Hughes, p. 16</ref>

===European journey===
Heber and Thornton had planned to follow their graduation with a [[Grand Tour]] of Europe. However, in 1804 the [[Napoleonic Wars]] made much of Europe inaccessible; the pair delayed their departure until the summer of 1805, and then organised a route through Sweden, Norway and Finland to Russia, rather than the traditional journey through France and Italy.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 22<U+2013>24</ref><ref>Hughes, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> In July 1805 they sailed for [[Gothenburg]] in Sweden, then travelled northward by stagecoach, via [[Lake Wener]] and [[Uddevalla]], to [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (Oslo) in Norway.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 25<U+2013>29</ref>  After a short stay in the city they moved further north, through the wild [[Dovre Region]] to [[Trondheim]], where they observed the practice of [[skiing]] for the first time (Heber referred to it as "skating").<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. I, pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref><ref>Montefiore, pp. 30<U+2013>33</ref>

The two travellers then turned south-east, re-entered Sweden and travelled through [[Uppsala]] to [[Stockholm]]. Towards the end of September they crossed the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] to [[Turku|<U+00C4>bo]] (Turku), the site of Europe's most northerly university, in what was then the Swedish part of Finland.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 38<U+2013>40</ref> They proceeded eastwards to the Russian border, and reached [[St Petersburg]] at the end of October.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> They spent two months in the city; through influential contacts at the British Embassy they visited places generally inaccessible to the public, even visiting [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]]'s private quarters in the [[Winter Palace]].<ref>Montefiore, pp. 49<U+2013>50</ref> They experienced Muslim worship at first hand, as the city's large Muslim population observed [[Ramadan]]; Heber described the crowds gathered for prayer in an improvised mosque as "the most decent and attentive congregation [he] had seen since leaving England".<ref>Hughes, p. 25</ref>
[[File:Reginaldheberbis00bric 0060.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of the Kremlin in Moscow]]
Heber and Thornton had intended to remain in St Petersberg until after [[Christmas]] and then, if the circumstances of the war permitted, to return home through Germany. Napoleon's victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] on 2 December 1805, and the treaties which followed it, led them to alter this plan.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 43 and 47</ref> They decided to extend their stay in Russia, with a visit the ancient [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]] capital, [[Moscow]], and to the regions of the south.  On 31 December 1805 they set out by sledge; the 500-mile journey, through wild and largely featureless country, was completed rapidly, and they arrived at Moscow on 3 January.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 50<U+2013>54</ref>  The two were among the last European visitors to see the city as it stood before its destruction, by its own inhabitants, six years later, in the face of Napoleon's [[Grande Arm<U+00E9>e]].<ref>Montefiore, p. 25</ref> In a letter home, Heber refers to Moscow as an "overgrown village";<ref>Heber and Heber Vol I, p. 150</ref> it was a hospitable city, and the pair formed friendships with many of its leading citizens and clergy. They left by stagecoach on 13 March, heading south towards the [[Crimea]] and the [[Black Sea]].<ref>Montefiore, pp. 56<U+2013>61</ref> This journey took them through the [[Cossacks|Cossack]] country of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River Basin]]. Heber sent home a vivid account of the night celebrations for [[Easter]] at Novo Tcherkask, the Cossack capital: "The soft plaintive chaunt {{sic}} of the choir, and their sudden change at the moment of daybreak to the full chorus of 'Christ is risen' were altogether what a poet or a painter would have studied with delight".<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. I, p. 244</ref>

Moving on to the Crimea, Heber encountered the region's large Muslim community, and observed eastern manners and practices for the first time. He expressed particular pleasure at being greeted with the oriental ''salaam''.<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. I, p. 267</ref> The course of the war in Europe had meanwhile shifted, so that Heber and Thornton were able, on the final stages of their journey, to pass through Poland, Hungary, Austria and Germany to reach the port of [[Hamburg]].<ref name= M78/> On the way they visited Austerlitz, where they heard accounts of the recent battle from the local population. In the course of his enquiries, which included making sketches of the scene, Heber was briefly mistaken for a French spy by local farmers.<ref>Hughes, p. 30</ref> At Hamburg the two travellers boarded Lord Morpeth's private yacht and sailed for England, arriving at [[Great Yarmouth]] on 14 October 1806.<ref name= M78>Montefiore, pp. 78<U+2013>82</ref>

==Rector of Hodnet==
===Parish priest===
[[File:Parish of St Luke, Hodnet - geograph.org.uk - 118295.jpg|thumb|The parish church at Hodnet, where Heber served as rector from 1807 to 1823]]
On his return to England, Heber prepared for [[Holy Orders]] at Oxford, where he found time for literary pursuits, was active in university politics and led a busy social life.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 84<U+2013>86</ref> He was ordained as [[deacon]] at the end of February 1807 and received full [[Priest|priest's orders]] from the [[Bishop of Oxford]] on 24 May 1807. He was then inducted into the family living, as rector of Hodnet;<ref>Hughes, pp. 33<U+2013>34</ref> he was later to describe his role as "a half-way station between a parson and a squire".<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. I, p. 391</ref> At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford, where he continued working for his [[Master of Arts|M.A. degree]] and fulfilled duties at All Souls. He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching: "Pray for me, my dear friend, that I may have my eyes open to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge with a quiet mind and a good conscience".<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. I, pp. 336<U+2013>337</ref> A [[High church|High Churchman]] by upbringing, Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals.<ref name= ODNB/>

On 9 April 1809 Heber married Amelia Shipley, the youngest daughter of the Dean of [[St Asaph Cathedral|St Asaph]]. He withdrew from Oxford, having secured his M.A., and set himself up permanently in the Hodnet rectory; finding this too small for his wife's liking he had the house demolished and a larger replacement built.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 88<U+2013>93</ref> In September 1813 Heber preached a sermon in [[Shrewsbury]] to the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]], a missionary organisation of which he had been a member since his undergraduate days. The sermon ended with what Hughes describes as Heber's first public declaration in support of the work of overseas missions.<ref>Hughes, p. 44</ref> He refused an appointment as a [[Prebendary|canon]] at [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]], preferring to continue his work in Hodnet in which, after 1814, he was assisted by his younger brother, the Revd Thomas Heber, who served as his curate until his death, at the age of 31, in 1816.<ref>Montefiore, pp. 94<U+2013>96</ref><ref>Hughes, p. 49</ref> The employment of a curate enabled Heber to devote more time to his literary pursuits, and to accept an invitation, in 1815, to deliver the [[Bampton Lectures]] at Oxford. He chose as his subject "The Personality and the Office of the Christian Comforter"; the series was published in 1822.<ref name= ODNB/>

In 1817 Heber accepted the post of canon at St Asaph, the relative proximity of which enabled the extra duties to be carried out without interfering with his parish work.<ref name= M98/> His main literary task during these years was a biography and critical study of the complete works of the 17th-century cleric [[Jeremy Taylor]]; the works, with Heber's critique, were published in 15 volumes between 1820 and 1822. This period of Heber's life was saddened by the death, on 24 December 1818, of his infant daughter after a short illness.<ref name= M98/>  Two more daughters were born later, in 1821 and 1824 respectively; both lived to adulthood.<ref name= ODNB/>  In 1822 Heber was elected to the church office of [[Lincoln's Inn#Preachers of Lincoln's Inn|Preacher of Lincoln's Inn]], which would require a regular term of residence in London. He saw this both as an extension of his service to the Church and as a means of renewing contact with old friends.<ref name= M98>Montefiore, pp. 98<U+2013>01</ref>

===Hymn writer===
[[File:GreenlandsIcyMountains.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Heber's controversial hymn "From Greenland's Icy Mountains" as published in a school hymnal in 1899]]
At the start of the 19th century the singing of hymns in churches, other than [[Metrical psalter|metrical psalms]], was officially disapproved by the Anglican authorities, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes.<ref name= Hughes77>Hughes, pp. 77<U+2013>78</ref> Heber, according to the poet [[John Betjeman]] in his anthology ''Sweet Songs of Zion'', was a professed admirer of the hymns of [[John Newton]] and [[William Cowper]], and was one of the first High Church Anglicans to write his own.  In all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. A handful of these have survived into popular use into the 21st century;<ref name= Betj57>Betjeman, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref>
one of these, widely sung until the second half of the 20th century, was the missionary hymn "From Greenland's Icy Mountains". The hymn was written in 1819, as part of a country-wide campaign on behalf of the [[USPG|Society for the Propagation of the Gospel]] (SPG). Watson describes this as "a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field".<ref>Watson 2002, p. 243</ref> In the modern world, Betjeman suggests, the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs, with references to "...every prospect pleases and only man is vile", and to "the heathen in his blindness [bowing] down to wood and stone".<ref name= Betj57/> These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]], who drew attention to them in a speech to the [[YMCA]] in Calcutta in 1925: "My own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the contrary ... [Man] is not vile. He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more so".<ref>{{cite journal|title= Gandhi's speech to YMCA 28 July 1925|url= http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/02/3105.shtml|journal= [[Young India]]|volume= 27|date= 6 August 1925|pages= pp. 434<U+2013>39}}</ref>

Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which he proposed to include some by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the [[Bishop of London]], [[William Howley]], in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged. Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber's death, as ''Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year''.<ref name= Hughes77/>

Betjeman asserts that Heber's style was consciously literary, with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech: "poetic imagery was as important as didactic truth".<ref>Betjeman, p. 59</ref> Watson draws attention to Heber's tendency to deliver what he terms "a rather obvious sermon",<ref>Watson 2002, p. 240</ref> and to his mixing of powerful description with "a rather trite moralism".<ref>Watson 1997, p. 323</ref>

==Bishop of Calcutta==
===Appointment===
The [[Episcopal see|see]] of Calcutta had been established in 1814. It covered much of the Indian subcontinent and Ceylon (Sri Lanka), together with Australia and parts of southern Africa.<ref name= ODNB/> The first bishop, [[Thomas Fanshawe Middleton|Thomas Middleton]], who had been consecrated in 1814, died in office in July 1822.<ref>{{cite web|last= Carson|first= Penelope|title= Middleton, Thomas Fanshaw|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18683?docPos=3|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|date= January 2008|accessdate= 8 July 2008}} {{subscription}}</ref> At the time the head of the Indian [[India Board|Board of Control]] was [[Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn (elder)|Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn]], an old Oxford friend of Heber's. In December 1822 Williams-Wynn wrote to Heber, not directly offering his friend the post<U+2014>the wording appeared to anticipate a refusal<U+2014>but nevertheless leaving Heber the opportunity to claim the office, should he wish.<ref name= Hughes82>Hughes, pp. 82<U+2013>84</ref> Heber had a longstanding interest in the work of overseas missions; he supported not only the SPG but also its more recently-formed evangelical sister-body, the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS), and while still at Oxford had helped to found the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS).<ref>Hughes, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref>

Heber's response to the implied offer was cautious; he was attracted to the post, his interest in distant places having been stimulated by his early travels.<ref name= ODNB/> However, he first asked Williams-Wynn whether there was a suitable local man for the appointment; he was told there was not. His next concern whether his wife and infant daughter should be exposed to the rigours of the Indian climate, and also if his own health was adequate. After consultation with doctors and discussion with his family, Heber wrote to Williams-Wynn on 2 January 1823, refusing the post. However, within days he had written again, regretting the refusal and asking to be considered, if the post was still available. Williams-Wynn quickly obtained the formal approval of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]] to the appointment.<ref name= Hughes82/> Heber spent the next few months at Hodnet preparing for his departure; during this period he gave a farewell sermon at Oxford, after which the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]] (D.D.) was conferred on him.<ref>Montefiore, p. 103</ref> On 1 June 1823 Heber was formally consecrated as Bishop of Calcutta at [[Lambeth Palace]], by the [[Charles Manners-Sutton|Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Two weeks later he departed for India with Amelia and his daughter Emily.<ref>Hughes, pp. 86<U+2013>88</ref>

===In office===
[[File:St. John's Church, Kolkata1.jpg|thumb|St John's, Calcutta, was the cathedral church for the Calcutta see at the time of Heber's episcopate.]]
The new bishop arrived in Calcutta on 10 October 1823, after a four-month journey. After his ceremonial installation by the Governor General, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]], Heber preached his first sermon as bishop on Sunday 12 October, in St John's Cathedral Church.<ref>Hughes, pp. 93<U+2013>95</ref>  He faced many challenges arising from tasks unfinished at the time of his predecessor's death and from the long hiatus without a bishop.  A major area of concern was Bishop's College, a training school for local clergy founded by Middleton in 1820, the development of which had stalled due to financial and management problems. Heber reinvigorated the project by extensive fundraising, by persuading the government to increase its grant of land, and by restarting the building programme; within a few months the college boasted a library and a new chapel.<ref>Montefiore, p. 129</ref>  In June 1824 Heber, using a power provided to him by recent [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]], ordained as deacon the first native Indian to receive Holy Orders.<ref>Hughes, p. 105</ref>

Heber was interested in all aspects of Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches.<ref name= ODNB/> Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a [[Consistory court]].<ref name= Hughes105>Hughes, pp. 105<U+2013>106</ref>

===Travels===
[[File:Benares19thC.jpg|thumb|left|An early 19th century depiction of Benares (Varanasi), visited by Heber in August<U+2013>September 1824]]
On 15 June 1824 Heber set out on a tour of northern India, accompanied by his personal chaplain Martin Stowe, and [[Daniel Corrie]], the [[Archdeacon]] of Calcutta.<ref name= Hughes105/> Amelia remained in Calcutta; earlier in the year she had given birth to her third daughter, Harriet.<ref>Hughes, p. 104</ref> The general plan was to travel by boat to the upper waters of the River [[Ganges]], then overland into the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] before turning south and west, crossing [[Rajputana]] to reach [[Bombay]].<ref name= ODNB/> The journey was almost aborted near to its beginning when Stowe fell ill in Dacca and died there; after some hesitation, Heber decided that the tour should continue.<ref>Hughes, p. 113</ref> Early in August the party reached [[Varanasi|Benares]] (now Varanasi), the largest of the cities in the Ganges plain, where Heber spent several weeks. It was a wholly Indian city without a European population, sacred to [[Hindu]]s, [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] but with a well-established CMS school and a large Christian minority. Heber consecrated a new church, and when he conducted a [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]] service in both English and [[Hindi-Urdu|Hindustani]], a large congregation of Christians and Hindus thronged the church.<ref name= Hughes120>Hughes, pp. 120<U+2013>124</ref><ref>Montefiore, pp. 138<U+2013>140</ref>

The party left Benares in mid-September. After reaching [[Allahabad]] they continued overland, accompanied by an armed troop of [[sepoys]].<ref name= Hughes120/> On 28 November they reached their farthest northerly point, at [[Almora]] in the [[Kumaon division|Kumaon]] region.<ref>Hughes, p. 136</ref> Their subsequent path southward took them to [[Dehli]], the ancient [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] capital, where Heber was presented to the ageing emperor [[Akbar Shah II]] in his dilapidated palace; Heber wrote of the emperor as "the venerable ruin of a mighty stock".<ref>Hughes, pp. 141<U+2013>143</ref>  In the final stages of the journey to Bombay, at Nerriad, Heber met with [[Swami Narayan]], the region's leading Hindu religious leader. Heber had hopes of converting the Swami to Christianity, but was disappointed in the meeting and finally dismissed the Swami as a worshipper of images.<ref>Hughes, pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref> On 19 April Heber arrived in Bombay, to be greeted a week later by Amelia and his daughters, who had arrived by sea from Calcutta.<ref>Montefiore, p. 147</ref>

Heber remained in Bombay for four months, and then decided that, instead of sailing directly for Calcutta, he would visit Ceylon on the way. He arrived at [[Galle]] on 25 August and spent five weeks touring the main cities before departing for Calcutta where he arrived on 19 October 1825 after an absence of 16 months.<ref>Hughes, pp. 158<U+2013>166</ref>

===Final months===

Heber wished to pass on to the Governor General, Lord Amherst, much of what he had learned and observed on his long voyage, and on his return to Calcutta busied himself with a series of detailed reports.<ref name= Hughes167/> He also wrote to Williams-Wynn in London, strongly criticising the [[East India Company]]'s stewardship of its Indian territories. He was concerned that few Indians were promoted to senior posts, and noted the "bullying, insolent manner" towards Indians that was typically adopted by the British.<ref>Hughes, pp. 170<U+2013>172</ref> Many local matters also demanded Heber's attention: the next phase in the development of Bishop's College, the preparation of a Hindustani dictionary, and a series of ordinations including that of Abdul Masih, an elderly [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] whose reception into Anglican orders had earlier been resisted by Bishop Middleton, on unspecified grounds<ref name= Hughes167>Hughes, pp. 167<U+2013>169</ref><ref>Montefiore, p. 151</ref>

In spite of the pressures on his time, Heber set out again on 30 January 1826, this time heading south for [[Chennai|Madras]] (now Chennai), [[Pondicherry]], [[Thanjavur|Tanjore]] (Thanjavur) and ultimately [[Travancore]]. One reason for the tour was to examine the issue of [[caste]], which persisted in the church in South India.<ref name= ODNB/> In Tanjore on [[Easter Day]], 26 March 1826, Heber preached to more than 1300, and on the following day conducted a [[confirmation]] service for a large [[Tamil people|Tamil]] congregation. On 1 April he moved on to [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichinopoly]] (Tiruchirappalli) where, next day, he confirmed 42 people. On 3 April, after attending an early-morning service at which he gave a blessing in the [[Tamil language]], Heber returned to his bungalow for a cold bath. Immediately after plunging into the water he died, possibly from the shock of the cold water in the intense heat.<ref>Hughes, pp. 178<U+2013>180</ref> Watson records that a contemporary engraving shows his body "being carried from the bath by his servant and chaplain, the latter immaculately attired in a frock coat and top hat".<ref>Watson 2002, p. 239</ref> His funeral was held the next day at St John's church, where he had preached his final sermon; he was buried within the church, on the north side of the altar.<ref name= Hughes181>Hughes, pp. 181<U+2013>183</ref>

Although Heber's episcopate had been brief he had made a considerable impression, and news of his death brought many tributes from around India. [[Charles Edward Grey|Sir Charles Grey]], an old Oxford friend who was serving as Calcutta's Chief Justice, spoke of Heber's cheerfulness, his lack of self-importance, his good humour, patience and kindness.<ref name= Hughes181/> Flags were flown at half-mast in Madras and Calcutta, and the Governor-General ordered a salute of 42 guns<U+2014>one for each completed year of the bishop's life.<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. II, p. 457</ref> In several cities public subscriptions were opened to raise funds for monuments.<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. II, pp. 458<U+2013>470 and pp. 474<U+2013>486</ref> In St John's church in Trichinopoly, initially a simple plaque above the grave recorded the date and place of Heber's death; this was in due course made much more elaborate.<ref name= Hughes181/> In St George's church, Madras, a large sculpture by [[Francis Chantrey]] was erected, depicting Heber ministering to members of his flock.<ref>Montefiore, p. 159</ref> Reflecting Heber's interest in the training of local [[Ordination|ordinands]], further funds were raised to provide Heber scholarships at Bishop's College; in Trichinopoly a school founded by the German missionary [[Christian Friedrich Schwarz]] became the [[Bishop Heber College|Heber Memorial School]].<ref>{{cite journal|title= Education Plus Tiruchirapalli|url= http://www.hindu.com/edu/2004/11/29/stories/2004112900580200.htm|journal= The Hindu ''online edition''|date= 29 November 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Bishop Heber College: A brief history of the college|url= http://www.bhc.edu.in/linker.php?id=colpro|publisher= Bishop Heber College|accessdate= 13 July 2012}}</ref>

It took four months for reports of Heber's death to reach England. At Oxford, representatives of Brasenose and All Souls opened a fund for an appropriate memorial; this idea was taken over by Williams-Wynn, who wanted a national rather than an Oxford-based monument. From the large sum collected, Chantrey was paid <U+00A3>3,000 for a huge marble sculpture that was placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London.<ref>Heber and Heber Vol. II, pp. 493<U+2013>494</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Stevens|first= Timothy|title= Chantrey, Sir Francis Leggatt|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5113?docPos=1|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edition|date= January 2008|accessdate= 13 July 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref> More modest memorials were raised in the parish churches at Hodnet and Malpas.<ref name= Hughes181/>

Heber was soon commemorated in print; as well as the publication of his hymns collection in 1827, the journal that he had kept during his northern India tour of 1824<U+2013>25 was published in 1828 and proved a great commercial success. Less popular was the three-volume biography and letters collection that Amelia published in 1830. In the ensuing years various collections of Heber's poetry appeared. Hughes observes that although some of the lighter verses are neat and amusing, the general quality is such that had Heber been only a poet, he would quickly have been forgotten.<ref name= Hughes185/> He has achieved a more lasting niche as a hymn-writer, although Betjeman observes that his militant imagery and the imperial attitudes underlying some of his verses have rendered many of his hymns unacceptable in the modern world.<ref>Betjeman, p. 57 and pp. 262<U+2013>63</ref> According to Hughes, among his hymns still widely sung are the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] hymn "Brightest and best of the sons of the morning"; "[[The Son of God Goes Forth to War|The Son of God goes forth to war]]", dedicated to the church's saints and martyrs, and the [[Trinity Sunday]] hymn "[[Holy, Holy, Holy|Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty]]".<ref name= Hughes77/> This last is probably the most widely known of all Trinity hymns and owes a great deal of its popularity to [[John Bacchus Dykes]]'s tune "Nicea": Watson observes that the tune's "magnificent grandeur carries the long lines effortlessly".<ref>Watson 2002, p. 245</ref> Hughes mentions two more Heber hymns that, he says, deserve to be better known: "God that madest earth and heaven" and "By cool Siloam's shady rill".<ref name= Hughes77/>

Heber's pioneering commitment to the mission fields was expressed, half a century after his death, by the author [[Charlotte Mary Yonge]]: "Heber was one of the first English churchmen who perceived that to enlarge her borders and strengthen her stakes was the bounden duty of the living Church".<ref>Yonge, p. 185</ref> He led through example, and through his writings which "did much to spread knowledge of, and therefore interest in, the field of labour in which he died".<ref>Yonge, p. 198</ref>

In July 1830 Amelia Heber married Count Demetrius Valsamachi, a Greek diplomat who became a British subject and was later [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]] by [[Queen Victoria]]. Amelia lived until 1870. Her daughter Emily married Algernon Percy, the son of the [[Hugh Percy (bishop)|Bishop of Carlisle]], and the younger daughter Harriet married a son of Heber's friend John Thornton.<ref name= Hughes185>Hughes, pp. 185<U+2013>188</ref>
