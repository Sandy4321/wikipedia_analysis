'''Gerard Wodarz''' ([[August 10]], [[1913]]&ndash;[[November 8]], [[1982]]) was one of the best [[soccer]] players of interwar [[Poland]]. He was a multiple champion of the country (representing [[Ruch Wielkie Hajduki]], which in January of [[1939]] became [[Ruch Chorzow]]) and also played 31 games on the [[Polish national football team]], scoring 13 goals.

He was born in 1913 in [[Wielkie Hajduki]] (a settlement in [[Upper Silesia]], which in January 1939 became part of the city of [[Chorzow]]), and died in [[1982]] in his hometown. 

Wodarz was a left-wing forward player. His career started in Ruch Wielkie Hajduki, in which he played in the years 1926-1939 and after the war, in 1946-47. Together with [[Ernest Wilimowski]] and [[Teodor Peterek]], was part of one of the best forward formations in the history of Ruch. In 183 games he scored 51 goals, and for five times was the Champion of Poland (1933-1936 and 1938). 

On the national team of Poland he took part in 31 games. His debut occurred on October 2, 1932 in [[Bucharest]], against [[Romania]]. Wodarz participated in the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin, where he scored 5 goals. Also, he represented Poland during one of the most famous games in Polish soccer history - against [[Brazil]] in [[Strasbourg]], [[France]], during the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 Football World Cup]].

After the [[Germany|German]] attack on Poland (September 1939) Wodarz signed a [[German Nationality List]] ([[Volksliste]]) and played for a newly-created team, [[Bismarckh<U+00FC>tter Sport Verein]] (which was based on the prewar Ruch Chorzow). In 1941 he was called up to the [[Wehrmacht]] and in 1944 he was captured by the [[U.S. Army]]. The Americans passed him to the [[Polish Army]] in [[Great Britain]], where he returned to soccer, playing for some British teams.

In 1946 he returned to Poland and for next two years represented Ruch Chorzow. His career ended in 1947. Later on he tried to coach several Upper Silesian teams, but without major achievements.
