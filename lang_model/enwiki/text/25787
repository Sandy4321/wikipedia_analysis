The '''Slime series''' is a games features the '''[[Slime (Dragon Quest)|Slime]]''' character from the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series. It is a [[spinoff]] series that is done is a style reminiscent of ''Dragon Quest''. Three games have been released, only the second title ''[[Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime]]''  has been released internationally.

==Development==
Yoshiki Watabe, producer of ''[[Dragon Quest VIII]]'', thought of the idea and approached series creator [[Yuji Horii]] and together they brainstormed the games genre and style.<ref name=origin/> Previously the two had discussed making a game for children while working on a port of ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'' to the [[Game Boy]], and the need for a main character appealing to children.<ref name=origin/> When first conceived, the game had the blue slime protagonist wielding a sword and shield, and a gameplay test was done in this style, but was rejected because developers felt  "This isn't really a slime game, this is like a blue [[Link (Legend of Zelda)|Link]]".<ref name=gamer/> Developers then started over and asked what a slime could do that a normal character couldn't, from which the idea of the player stretching and launching the slime at enemies and objects came from.<ref name=gamer/> The developers also chose to keep humans out of the game, due to that if they did appear, they would probably just run around killing all the Slimes.<ref name="npinterview"/>

When the second game was localized for the American audience, there was concern about the Slimes identifiability with the public, and so ''Dragon Quest'' was added to the title.<ref name=origin/> Watabe wanted to make sure that ''Rocket Slime'' used both screens for gameplay, unlike most other DS titles that just used it for menus, believing that the duel screens was the consoles "focus". <ref name="npinterview"/><ref name=origin/> Early in the title's life, the developers had a version of it that uses the touch screen to use Rocket's Elasto Blast technique, but scrapped the idea, due to it being too hard to control.<ref name="npinterview">{{cite web |title=Go Behind the Scenes of the Latest Dragon Quest Nintendo DS Games |url=http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=WGmBSvvcfHloppDbPJ8itVrPi0vrCvED&page=  |publisher=[[Nintendo]].com |accessdate=2008-12-13 |date=2006-06-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060906203736/http://www.nintendo.com/newsarticle?articleid=WGmBSvvcfHloppDbPJ8itVrPi0vrCvED&page= |archivedate = 2006-09-06}}</ref> In a search for what to do with the Nintendo DS's two screens, the developers arrived at the idea of a tank battle, and a duel view allowing players to see inside and outside the tank at once.<ref name=gamer/> Each character name was approved during localization by [[Square Enix]], and names involving American cultural references had to be explained in Japanese, a task that saw many jokes cut and replaced.<ref name=gamer/>

Watabe said that if ''Dragon Quest Heroes'' sold well, that the developer would look into a sequel, and they may also include [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] support.<ref name="npinterview"/> On March 16, 2011 a third installment in the series was announced featuring [[stereoscopic 3D]] and customizable pirate ships for combat.<ref name="combat"/>

==Common elements==
The blue slime is a monster from the Japanese ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' video game series. The ''Dragon Quest'' series includes over 20 types of slimes, the majority of which are present in these games. As the player rescues other slimes, more areas of the world are opened up. Attacking enemies is done by stretching the slime and then releasing, flinging it forward. The player can also hover temporarily in the air, and bury themselves in the ground while still moving. The player can also carry enemies or other slimes on his head. Enemies, of which he can carry up to three, can be thrown as an attack, while friends are required to be carried to a conveyance back home in order to count as rescued. These modes of transportation include rail carts, airships, and balloons. Occasionally slimes in the village will give quests to the player, which require them to carry enemies or items to these transport points.<ref name="IGNpreview"/> Picking up a certain enemy, the swordsman, allows the player to perform a sword attack which is faster than the standard stretch attack. If the player is hit by an enemy, everything they are carrying is dropped. The slime can die if attacked too many times by enemies, as well as if the player takes too long to complete a dungeon, as in the game night falls and they are kidnapped by the Tails brigade like the rest of their village.<ref name="IGNpreview"/> The main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of the games has involved the protagonist blue slime trying to save his family and friends that were kidnapped by a group of monsters. The protagonist journeys across the world to find and rescue the kidnapped slimes, which are kept in treasure chests in dungeons.<ref name="IGNpreview"/>
