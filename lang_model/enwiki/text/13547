'''HMS ''Queen Mary''''' was a battlecruiser built by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] before [[World War I]], the sole member of her [[ship class|class]]. She was similar to the {{sclass|Lion|battlecruiser}}s, though she differed in details from her half-sisters. She was the last battlecruiser completed before the beginning of the war and participated in the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] shortly after the war began. As part of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, she attempted to intercept a German force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England in December 1914, but was unsuccessful. She was refitting during the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] in early 1915, but participated in the next major fleet action of the war, the [[Battle of Jutland]] in mid-1916. She was hit twice by the German battlecruiser {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}} during the 'Run to the South' and exploded shortly afterwards.

Her wreck was discovered in 1991 and rests partly upside-down, on sand, {{convert|60|m|0}} down. ''Queen Mary'' is designated as a ''protected place'' under the [[Protection of Military Remains Act 1986]].

==Design==
===General characteristics===
[[Image:Lion class battleship - Jane's Fighting Ships, 1919 - Project Gutenberg etext 24797.png|thumb|left|Left elevation and deck plan of the ''Lion''-class battlecruisers to which ''Queen Mary'' was almost identical externally|alt=Drawing of three-stacked battlecruiser]]
''Queen Mary'' was slightly larger than her predecessors of the {{sclass|Lion|battlecruiser|4}}. She had an overall length of {{convert|703|ft|6|in|m|0}}, including her [[sternwalk]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|80|ft|0.5|in|m}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|32|ft|4|in|m|2}} at deep load. The ship displaced {{convert|26770|LT|t|0}} at load and {{convert|31650|LT|t|0}} at deep load, over {{convert|1000|LT|t|0}} more than the earlier ships. She had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|5.92|ft|1}} at deep load.<ref>Roberts, pp. 43, 45</ref>

''Queen Mary'' was the first battlecruiser to place her officer's quarters in their traditional location, the stern of the ship.<ref>Burt, p. 45</ref> In addition she was the first to mount a sternwalk.<ref name=Parkes>Parkes, pp. 531-536</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Queen Mary'' had two Parsons steam turbines, each of which was housed in a separate engine-room and drove two shafts. The wing shaft was coupled to the high-pressure ahead and astern turbines and the low-pressure turbines to the inner shafts. A cruising stage was built into the casing of each high-pressure ahead turbine.<ref>Burt, p. 158</ref> The turbines were powered by forty-two [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler]]s in seven boiler rooms.<ref>Roberts, pp. 70<U+2013>76</ref> They were designed to produce a total of {{convert|75000|shp|lk=in|0}}, but achieved more than {{convert|83000|shp|abbr=on|0}} during trials, although ''Queen Mary'' barely exceeded her designed speed of {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 76, 80</ref>

She carried {{convert|3600|LT|t}} of coal, and an additional {{convert|1170|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate.<ref>Roberts, p. 76</ref> At full capacity, she could steam for {{convert|5610|nmi|km}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=c24>Gardiner and Gray, p. 31</ref>

===Armament===
''Queen Mary'' mounted eight [[BL 13.5 inch /45 naval gun|BL {{convert|13.5|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk V gun]]s in four twin hydraulically powered BII turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'Y' from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to <U+2212>3<U+00B0> and elevated to 20<U+00B0>, although the [[rangefinder]]s controlling the turrets were limited to 15<U+00B0> 21' until superelevating prisms were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation.<ref name=c27>Campbell, p. 33</ref> They fired {{convert|1250|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2582|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; at 14.75<U+00B0>, this provided a maximum range of {{convert|20000|yd|abbr=on|0}} with [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing (AP)]] shells. At 20<U+00B0> elevation, the range was extended to {{convert|23820|yd|m|abbr=on|0}}. The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5<U+2013>2 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_135-45_mk5.htm|title=British 13.5"/45 (34.3 cm) Mark V(L) 13.5"/45 (34.3 cm) Mark V(H)|date=1 May 2009|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref> The ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.<ref name=r3>Roberts, p. 83</ref>

Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII|BL {{convert|4|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mark VII guns]], most of which were mounted in [[casemate]]s.<ref name=r3>Roberts, p. 83</ref> The guns on their PVI mounts could depress to -7<U+00B0> and had a maximum elevation of 15<U+00B0>. They fired {{convert|31|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2864|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; this gave a maximum range of {{convert|11600|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Their rate of fire was 6<U+2013>8 rounds per minute.<ref name=nav>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_4-40_mk3.htm|title=British 4"/50 (10.2 cm) BL Mark VII|date=14 October 2008|accessdate=11 November 2009}}</ref> They were provided with 150 rounds per gun.<ref name=c27/>

''Queen Mary'' was built without any [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns, but two guns were fitted in October 1914. One was a [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] gun on a high-angle MkIc mounting.<ref name=r3/> This had a maximum depression of 8<U+00B0> and a maximum elevation of 60<U+00B0>. It fired a {{convert|6|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1765|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. It had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|10000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of only {{convert|1200|yd}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_6pounder_m1.htm|title=Britain 6-pdr / 8cwt (2.244"/40 (57 mm)) QF Marks I and II|date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2009|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref> A [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]] gun on a HA MkII mount was also fitted in October 1914. It had a maximum depression of 10<U+00B0> and a maximum elevation of 90<U+00B0>. It fired a {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2500|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 12<U+2013>14 rounds per minute. It had a maximum effective ceiling of {{convert|23500|ft|m|abbr=on|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_3-45_mk1.htm|title=British 12-pdr (3"/45 (76.2 cm)) 20cwt QF HA Marks I, II, III and IV |date=27 February 2007|accessdate=11 November 2009|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref>

Two {{convert|21|in|adj=on}} submerged [[torpedo tube]]s were fitted, one on each side.<ref name=c24/> Fourteen [[British 21 inch torpedo#21 inch Mark II|Mk II***]] torpedoes were carried<ref name=r3/> which had a warhead of {{convert|515|lb|0}} of [[TNT]]. They had two speed settings which governed their range; at {{convert|45|knots}} they could reach {{convert|4500|yd|0}} or {{convert|10750|yd|0}} at {{convert|31|knots}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTBR_PreWWII.htm|title=British Torpedoes Pre-World War II: 21" (53.3 cm) Mark II***|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref>

===Fire-control===
The main guns of the ''Queen Mary'' were controlled from the [[conning tower]]. Data from a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} Argo rangefinder located on top of the conning tower was input into a Argo Clock Mk IV (a mechanical fire-control computer) located in the Transmitting Station (TS) below the conning tower where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. The aft torpedo director tower was the backup primary gunnery control position. 'B' and 'X' turrets were provided with nine-foot rangefinders and were fitted as secondary control positions.<ref>Roberts, pp. 91<U+2013>92</ref> 

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]] mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. ''Queen Mary'' received her before the Battle of Jutland in 1916.<ref>Roberts, pp. 92<U+2013>93</ref>

===Armour===
The armour protection given to the ''Queen Mary'' was similar than that of the ''Lion''s; her waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[Krupp armour|Krupp Cemented Armour]] was also {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} thick between 'B' and 'X' turrets. It thinned to four inches towards the ships' ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. In addition they were given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to {{convert|5|in|mm|0}} abreast the end turrets. Four-inch transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s closed off the ends of the armoured citadel. High-tensile steel, cheaper than nickel-steel, but equally as effective, plating was used for the protective decks. The lower armoured deck was generally only {{convert|1|in|1}} thick except outside the citadel where it was {{convert|2.5|in|0}}. The upper armoured deck was situated at the top of the upper armour belt and was also only one inch thick. The forecastle deck ranged from {{convert|1|to|1.5|in|1}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 102<U+2013>03</ref>

The gun turrets had 9-inch front and sides while their roofs were {{convert|2.5|to|3.25|in|mm|0}} thick. The [[barbette]]s were protected by 9 inches of armour above the deck, but it thinned to {{convert|8|in|mm|0}} above the upper armour deck and {{convert|3|in|0}} below it. The forward 4-inch guns were protected by three-inch sides and a two-inch high-tensile steel deck overhead. The conning tower sides were {{convert|10|in|0}} thick and it had a three-inch roof and communication tube. Her after torpedo director tower was protected by six-inch walls and a three-inch cast steel roof. High-tensile steel [[torpedo bulkhead]]s {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0}} thick were fitted abreast the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and shell rooms. Her funnel uptakes were protected by high-tensile steel splinter armour {{convert|1.5|in|0}} thick on the sides and one inch on the ends between the upper and forecastle decks.<ref>Roberts, pp. 109, 112</ref>

==Service==
===Pre-war career===
''Queen Mary'' was laid down at [[Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company]], [[Jarrow]] on 6 March 1911. She was launched on 20 March 1912 and was completed on 4 September 1913,<ref>Roberts, p. 41</ref> at a total cost of <U+00A3>2,078,491.<ref>Burt, p. 167</ref> Upon commissioning, she joined the [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]] (BCS), under command of Rear Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]]. ''Queen Mary'', along with the rest of the 1st BCS, made a port visit to [[Brest, France|Brest]] in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June.<ref>Burt, p. 161</ref>

===World War I===
====Battle of Heligoland Bight====
{{Main|Battle of Heligoland Bight}}
''Queen Mary''{{'}}s first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 28 August 1914. Beatty's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the [[High Seas Fleet]] sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 AM<ref group=Note>The times used in this article are in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is one hour behind [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.</ref> when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the [[Jade Estuary]]. The brand-new light cruiser {{HMS|Arethusa|1913|2}} had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers {{SMS|Strassburg||2}} and {{SMS|K<U+00F6>ln|1909|2}} when Beatty's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37 PM. ''Strassburg'' was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but ''K<U+00F6>ln'' remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. Beatty, however, was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser {{SMS|Ariadne||2}} directly to his front. He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at close range (under {{convert|6000|yd|km}}). At 1:10 PM Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Beatty's main body encountered the crippled ''K<U+00F6>ln'' shortly after turning north and she was sunk by two salvos from {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}}.<ref>Massie, pp. 109<U+2013>13</ref>

====Raid on Scarborough====
{{Main|Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby}}
The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier [[Raid on Yarmouth]] on 3 November had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would actually conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of [[Dogger Bank]] to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including ''Lion'', as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.<ref>Massie, pp. 333<U+2013>34</ref>

Admiral Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5:15 AM and fought an inconclusive action with them. Vice Admiral [[George Warrender, 7th Baronet|Sir George Warrender]], commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron, had received a signal at 5:40 that the destroyer {{HMS|Lynx|1913|2}} was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not. The destroyer {{HMS|Shark|1912|2}} spotted the German armoured cruiser {{SMS|Roon||2}} and her escorts at about 7:00, but could not transmit the message until 7:25. Admiral Warrender received the signal, as did the battlecruiser {{HMS|New Zealand||2}}, but Beatty did not, despite the fact that ''New Zealand'' had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty. Warrender attempted to pass on ''Shark''{{'}}s message to Beatty at 7:36, but did not manage to make contact until 7:55. Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched ''New Zealand'' to search for ''Roon''. She was being overhauled by ''New Zealand'' when Beatty received messages that [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] was being shelled at 9:00. Beatty ordered ''New Zealand'' to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.<ref>Massie, pp. 342<U+2013>43</ref>

[[Image:Scheer's illustration of I SG disposition 16 Dec. 1916 en.SVG|thumb|left|Relative positions of the British and German forces at about 12:00]] 
The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty's ships passed to the north while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a {{convert|15|nmi|km|0}} gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II&nbsp;Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. The light cruiser {{HMS|Southampton|1912|2}} spotted the light cruiser {{SMS|Stralsund||2}} and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however, those were some 50&nbsp;km&nbsp;(31&nbsp;mi) behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions.<ref group=Note>Beatty had intended on retaining only the two rearmost light cruisers from [[William Goodenough|Goodenough's]] squadron; however, {{HMS|Nottingham|1913|2}}{{'}}s signalman misinterpreted the signal, thinking that it was intended for the whole squadron, and thus transmitted it to Goodenough, who ordered his ships back into their screening positions ahead of Beatty's battlecruisers.</ref> This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.<ref> Tarrant, p. 34</ref>

She was refitting January-February 1915 and did not participate in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]].<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>

====Battle of Jutland====
{{Main|Battle of Jutland}}
On 31 May 1916 ''Queen Mary'' put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20 PM, but Beatty's ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 3:30. Almost immediately afterward, at 3:32, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to port, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about {{convert|60|mi}} behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 69, 71, 75</ref>

This began what was to be called the 'Run to the South' as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under {{convert|18000|yd}}. The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed almost immediately afterwards by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'' had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British over-estimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. ''Queen Mary'' opened fire about 3:50 on {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}, using only her forward turrets.<ref>Brooks, p. 237</ref> By 3:54 the range was down to {{convert|12900|yd}} and Beatty ordered a course change two [[Boxing the compass|points]] to starboard to open up the range at 3:57.<ref>Tarrant, p. 83</ref> During this period ''Queen Mary'' made two hits on ''Seydlitz'', at 3:55 and 3:57, one of which caused a massive cordite fire that burnt-out her aft [[Superfire|superfiring]] turret<ref>Brooks, p. 241</ref> 

[[Image:Destruction of HMS Queen Mary.jpg|thumb|left|''Queen Mary'' explodes during the Battle of Jutland]]
The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 4:12 and 4:15. This maneuver exposed ''Lion'' to the fire of the German battlecruisers and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}} to lose sight of ''Princess Royal'' and she switched her fire to ''Queen Mary'' at 4:16. ''Queen Mary'' hit ''Seydlitz'' again at 4:17 that knocked out one gun of her secondary armament.<ref>Tarrant, p. 89</ref> At 4:21 ''Seydlitz'' hit the turret face of 'Q' turret and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret; she had been hit twice earlier by ''Seydlitz'', but with unknown effects. By 4:25 the range was down to {{convert|14400|yd}} and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. However it was too late for ''Queen Mary'' as ''Derfflinger''{{'}}s fire began to take effect and she hit ''Queen Mary'' twice before 4:26.<ref>Brooks, p. 246</ref> One shell hit forward and detonated one or both of the forward [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s which broke the ship in two near the foremast. The second hit may have struck 'Q' turret and started a fire in 'Q' working chamber. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink.<ref name=b7>Brown, p. 167</ref>

The battlecruiser behind her, {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}}, was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains.<ref>Brooks, p. 247</ref> All but nine of her 1,266 crew were lost (two of the survivors were picked up by German ships).<ref>Burt, p. 168</ref> Her aft end is upside down and intact, although her propellers have been salvaged.<ref name=b7>Brown, p. 167</ref> ''Queen Mary'', along with the other Jutland wrecks, has belatedly been declared a ''protected place'' under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,257 officers and men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20062616.htm|title=Statutory Instrument 2006 No. 2616  The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2006|publisher=Queen's Printer of Acts of Parliament|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref>
