'''Frederick Campbell Crews'''<ref name = GF>{{cite web | url = http://www.gf.org/fellows/all?index=c&page=20 | title = The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation list of All Fellows | publisher = [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}</ref> (born 1933, [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]) is an [[#Honors and awards|award-winning]] [[United States|American]] essayist, [[Literary criticism|literary critic]], author, and [[Emeritus|Professor Emeritus]] of English at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://english.berkeley.edu/contact/person_detail.php?person=87 | publisher = [[University of California, Berkeley]] | title = Frederick C. Crews, Emeritus - Staff page at UC, Berkeley | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}</ref>  He received popular attention for ''The Pooh Perplex'', a book of [[Satire|satirical]] essays [[parody]]ing contemporary [[Casebook#Other meanings|casebooks]].  Initially a proponent of [[psychoanalytic literary criticism]], Crews later moved away from, and in the early 1980s rejected psychoanalysis, going on to criticize Freud's [[Science|scientific]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] standards. Crews became a prominent critic of Freud during the "Freud wars" of the 1980s and 90s, which debated the Viennese psychoanalyst's reputation, scholarship and impact on the 20th century.  

Crews has also published a variety of [[Skepticism|skeptical]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] essays, including book reviews and commentary for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', on a variety of topics including Freud's work and [[recovered memory therapy]], both of which were published as separate collections.  Crews has also published several successful [[handbook]]s on the [[English language]].

==Biography==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Crews completed his undergraduate education at [[Yale University]], and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1958.<ref name = Marcus2002>{{cite web | url = http://www.princeton.edu/paw/web_exclusives/features/features_013002a.html | title = Lit crit Frederick Crews *58, author of The Pooh Perplex, pokes the Academy once more with his new book, Postmodern Pooh | last = Marcus | first = D | date = 2002-01-30 | accessdate = 2009-04-28 | publisher = [[Princeton University|Princeton Alumni Weekly]] }}</ref>  As of 2009, Crews was a [[Professors in the United States#Professor emeritus and emerita|Professor Emeritus]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://calnet.berkeley.edu/directory/details.pl?uid=55116 | title = Details for: Frederick C.

==Publications ==
===Satire===
In 1963, Crews published his first [[bestseller]] ''The Pooh Perplex: A Student Casebook'' that [[Satire|satirized]] the [[casebook#Other meanings|casebooks]] then assigned to first-year university students in introductory courses to [[English literature]] or [[rhetoric]].  Derived in part from a play put on by Crews's English department in 1958, the book featured a fictitious set of English professors writing [[Exegesis|exegetical]] essays on [[A. A. Milne]]'s classic character [[Winnie-the-Pooh]], [[parody]]ing [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Psychoanalysis|Freudian]], [[Christianity|Christian]], [[F. R. Leavis|Leavisite]] and [[Leslie Fiedler|Fiedlerian]] approaches.  Though urged by readers to publish a follow-up volume, Crews delayed writing a follow-up until after his retirement in 1994, producing ''Postmodern Pooh'' in 2001.  The follow-up book repeated the satire of the original with more contemporary critical perspectives such as [[deconstruction]], [[radical feminism]], [[queer theory]], and [[recovered memory therapy]], in part basing the essay authors and their approaches on actual academics and their work.<ref name = Marcus2002/>

A 1968 publication by Crews entitled ''The Patch Commission'' was a satirical look at [[Presidential Commission (United States)|Presidential Commissions]] that emphasized his disapproval of American involvement in the then-ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Crews | first = FC | title = The Patch Commission | publisher = [[E.

===Literary criticism===
Much of Crews's career has been dedicated to [[literary criticism]].  Crews's first book was ''The Tragedy of Manners: Moral Drama in the Later Novels of Henry James'', published in 1957, was based on a prize-winning essay written by Crews while an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] student at Yale University, initially published as part of a series.<ref name= Carlson1985>{{cite book |author=Carlson SJ|title=Women of grace: James's plays and the comedy of manners |publisher=UMI Research Press |location=Ann Arbor, Mich |year=1985 |pages= 5 |isbn=0-8357-1617-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = The Tragedy of Manners: Moral Drama in the Later Novels of Henry James  | journal = Yale University.

In 1986, Crews published ''The Critics Bear It Away'', which was wholly devoted to literary criticism.<ref>{{cite book | last = Crews | first = FC | title = The Critics Bear It Away: American Fiction and the Academy | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 1992 | isbn = 0679404139 }}</ref>  ''The Critics Bear It Away'' was described as part of a [[Liberalism|Liberal]] revival within education after a long period of [[Conservatism]] focussing on the revision of the [[Western canon]], and filled with an internal conflict between Crews's sympathies with and opposition to the revisionist position.<ref name = Erickson1993/>  ''The Critics Bear It Away'' was nominated for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for nonfiction<ref name = Hartford1993>{{cite news | work = [[The Hartford Courant]] | title = Critics nominate best books of '92 | date = 1993-01-19 | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/80171114.html?dids=80171114:80171114&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jan+19%2C+1993&author=&pub=Hartford+Courant&desc=Critics+nominate+best+books+of+%2792&pqatl=google | pages = C.6 }}</ref> and won the Spielvogel-Diamonstein Award for the Art of the Essay Winners<ref name = SDA>{{cite web | url = http://www.pen.org/page.php/prmID/907 | title = Spielvogel-Diamonstein Award for the Art of the Essay Winners | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}</ref>  Parts of his 1975 collection ''Out of My System'',<ref name="Crews 1975">{{cite book | last = Crews | first = FC | title = Out of My System: Psychoanalysis, Ideology, and Critical Method | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1975 | isbn = 0195019474  }}</ref> the 1986 collection ''Skeptical Engagements'',<ref name="Crews 1986">{{cite book | last = Crews | first = FC | title = Skeptical Engagements | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 0195039505 | year = 1986}}</ref> and the 2005 ''Follies of the Wise''<ref>{{cite book | last = Crews | first = FC | title = Follies of the Wise: Dissenting Essays | year =  2005 | isbn = 1593761015 | publisher = Shoemaker & Hoard }}</ref> were also dedicated to literary criticism.

===Criticisms of Freud and psychoanalysis ===
Crews began his career using a [[psychoanalytic literary criticism]] position but gradually rejected this approach and [[psychoanalysis]] in general. In his article "Reductionism and Its Discontents", published in ''Out of My System'' in 1975, Crews stated his belief that psychoanalysis can be usefully applied to literary criticism but expressed growing doubts about its use as a [[Psychotherapy|therepeutic]] approach, suggesting that it had a weak, sometimes comical tradition of criticism.<ref name="Crews 1975"/>  Crews rejected psychoanalysis entirely in his article "Analysis Terminable" (first published in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' in 1980 and reprinted in his collection ''Skeptical Engagements'' in 1986) citing what he considered its faulty methodology, its ineffectiveness as therapy, and the harm it caused to parents.<ref name="Crews 1986"/>  Describing himself as "a one-time Freudian who had decided to help others resist the fallacies to which I had succumbed in the 1960s", his position was summarized in [[Salon.com]] as "psychoanalysis is a spurious, ineffective [[pseudoscience]], based on the fudged data of an unscrupulous and calculating founder and perpetuated by followers who mimic his craftiness in a 'shell game whereby critics of Freudianism are always told that new breakthroughs render their strictures obsolete,'" supporting his objections to Freud's personal qualities and theories [[Empiricism|empirically]] with "extensive and meticulous research".<ref name = Miller1993>{{cite news | last = Miller | first = L | url = http://dir.salon.com/story/books/feature/1995/12/02/freud/ | title = Freudian Flame Wars - The Memory Wars: Freud's Legacy in Dispute | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | date = 1995-12-02 | publisher = [[Salon.com]] }}</ref>

Crews describes his criticisms of Freud as two-pronged - one aimed at Freud's [[Ethics|ethical]] and [[Science|scientific]] standards, and the other aimed at showing that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience.<ref>{{cite news | last = Crews | first = FC | title = Cheerful assassin defies analysis | url = http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=96726&sectioncode=26 | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | date = 1995-03-03 | work = [[Times Higher Education]] }}</ref>  Two of his essays, "Analysis Terminable" and "The Unknown Freud", published in 1993, have been described as shots fired at the beginning of the "Freud Wars," a long-running debate over [[Sigmund Freud]]'s reputation, work and impact.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E4D6173DF930A25754C0A9659C8B63&sec=health&spon=&pagewanted=3 | title = The Literary Freud  | last = Merkin | first = D | date = 2003-07-13 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2009-02-19}} (subscription requried)</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Gellner, Ernest |title=The Psychoanalytic Movement: The Cunning of Unreason |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2003 |pages= [http://books.google.com/books?id=fwfqND9176oC&pg=PR22 xxii] |isbn=0-631-23413-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>  "The Unknown Freud" prompted an unprecedented number of letters to fill the pages of the ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' for several issues.<ref name = Miller1993/>  Crews went on to criticize Freud and psychoanalysis extensively, becoming a major figure in the discussions and criticisms of Freud that occurred during the 1980s and '90s.  In 1996, Crews credited [[Henri Ellenberger|Henri F. Ellenberger]]'s ''[[The Discovery of the Unconscious]]'' with beginning a twenty five year long reevaluation of the position of psychoanalysis within the history of medicine.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Crews| first = FC | year = 1996 | url = http://www.cis.vt.edu/modernworld/d/Freudeval.html |title = The Verdict on Freud | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00331.x | pages = 63<U+2013>8 }}</ref>  Crews was one of a number of critics who protested an exhibit presented at the [[Library of Congress]] in 1998, as too positive and favorable to Freud; the protests delayed the exhibit's opening by almost a year, and almost cancelled it outright.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/health/jan-june99/freud.html | title = A News Hour with Jim Lehrer - Sigmund Freud | date = 1999-01-06 | accessdate = 2009-04-29 | last = Lehrer | first = J |publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS.com]] }}</ref>

===Criticisms of recovered memory therapy===
In 1993 and 1994, Crews wrote a series of critical essays and reviews of books relating to [[Repressed memory|repressed]] and [[Recovered memory therapy|recovered memories]],<ref>{{cite article |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1950 |title=Freud and Memory: An Exchange | publisher= [[The New York Review of Books]] |last = Crews | first = FC | coauthors = Erdelyi M }}</ref> which also provoked heated debate and letters to the editors of ''The New York Review of Books''.<ref name = Miller1993/>  The essays, along with critical and supporting letters and his responses, were published as ''The Memory Wars'' in 1995<ref>{{cite book |first=F. |last=Crews |year=1997 |title=The Memory Wars|publisher= [[The New York Review of Books]] |location=New York |isbn = 0940322048 |pages=  71}}</ref> and Crews's articles alone were republished as ''Follies of the Wise'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite book | last = Crews | first = FC | title = Follies of the Wise: Dissenting Essays | year =  2006 | isbn = 1593761015 | publisher = Shoemaker & Hoard }}</ref>  Crews believes the memories and fantasies of childhood seduction reported by Freud were not real memories but were constructs created by him and forced upon his patients.  The [[Freud's seduction theory|seduction theory]] that Freud abandoned in the late 1890s is seen by Crews as a precedent and contributing factor to the wave of [[false allegation of child sexual abuse|false allegations of childhood sexual abuse]] in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/10/reviews/970810.10boxert.html?_r=4&scp=2&sq=Frederick%20Crews&st=cse | title = Floggin Freud | last = Boxer | first = S | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1997-08-10 | accessdate = 2009-02-19}} (subscription required)</ref>

===Other interests===
====Writing handbooks====
In 1974, Crews published a [[handbook]] for [[Random House]] on the proper uses of the [[English language]].  The book was praised for being extremely readable, helpful, and written as if Crews enjoyed writing it<ref>{{cite journal | last = Douglas | first = GH | title = Book Review - The Random House Handbook | doi = 10.1177/002194367401100311 | url = http://job.sagepub.com/cgi/content/citation/11/3/57 | journal = Journal of Business Communication | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 57 | year = 1974 }}</ref> and was highly successful,<ref>{{cite news | title = College Text 'Dumbing' Aids Sales | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | last = Trombley | first = W | date = 1982-01-10 | pages = A1 }}</ref> running to nine editions.

====''The New York Review of Books''====
In his capacity as a reviewer for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Crews has used a [[Rationalism|rational]], critical and [[Skepticism|skeptical]] position to address diverse topics, often using satire to make his points.  In addition to his publications on Freud and recovered memory therapy, topics Crews has written on include:
* A 1998 review of books related to the UFO [[abduction phenomenon]], stating he believed the use of hypnosis, [[suggestion]] and [[demand characteristics]] by unskilled [[hypnotherapy|hypnotherapists]], and [[confabulation]] by the subjects were the primary causes of the phenomenon, and sources of the memories.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Crews | first = FC | journal = [[The New York Review of Books]] | title = The Mindsnatchers | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=800| accessdate = 2009-02-19 | date = 1998 | volume = 45 | issue = 11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Crews | first = FC | volume = 45 | issue = 15 | year = 1998 | title = 'When Words Collide': An Exchange | coauthors = Dumm TL; Hopkins B; Jacobs DM & Maier DF | journal = [[The New York Review of Books]] | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/724 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}</ref>
