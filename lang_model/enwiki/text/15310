The '''White Stork''' (''Ciconia ciconia'') is a large [[bird]] in the [[stork]] family Ciconiidae. Its [[plumage]] is mainly white, with black on its wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average {{convert|100|<U+2013>|115|cm|in|abbr=on}} from beak tip to end of tail, with a {{convert|195|<U+2013>|215|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan. The two [[subspecies]], which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to [[Estonia]]), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern [[Kazakhstan]]), and southern Africa. The White Stork is a long-distance [[bird migration|migrant]], wintering in Africa from tropical [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] to as far south as [[South Africa]], or on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and detours via the [[Levant]] in the east or the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] in the west, because the air [[thermals]] on which it depends do not form over water.

A [[carnivore]], the White Stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, and small birds. It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. It is a [[monogamous]] breeder, but does not pair for life. Both members of the pair build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. Each year the female can lay one [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] of usually four eggs, which hatch [[wiktionary:asynchronous|asynchronously]] 33<U+2013>34&nbsp;days after being laid. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and both feed the young. The young leave the nest 58<U+2013>64&nbsp;days after hatching, and continue to be fed by the parents for a further 7<U+2013>20&nbsp;days.

The White Stork has been rated as ''[[Least Concern]]'' by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). It benefited from human activities during the [[Middle Ages]] as woodland was cleared, but changes in farming methods and industrialisation saw it decline and disappear from parts of Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Conservation and [[reintroduction]] programs across Europe have resulted in the White Stork resuming breeding in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. It has few natural predators, but may harbour several types of parasite; the plumage is home to [[chewing louse|chewing lice]] and feather mites, while the large nests maintain a diverse range of [[mesostigmata|mesostigmatic]] mites. This conspicuous bird has given rise to many legends across its range, of which the best-known is the story of babies being brought by storks.

== Taxonomy and evolution ==
The White Stork was one of the many [[Aves in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|bird species originally described]] by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in the landmark 1758 [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'',<ref>{{cite book | last= Linnaeus | first =Carl | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

As with other storks, the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar.<ref name=HBW438>Elliott 1992, p. 438.</ref> In flapping [[bird flight|flight]] its wingbeats are slow and regular. It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail. It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched.

Upon hatching, the young White Stork is partly covered with short, sparse, whitish [[down feather]]s. This early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down. By three weeks, the young bird acquires black scapulars and [[flight feather]]s. On hatching the chick has pinkish legs, which turn to greyish-black as it ages. Its beak is black with a brownish tip.<ref name=BWP335/> By the time it [[fledge]]s, the juvenile bird's plumage is similar to that of the adult, though its black feathers are often tinged with brown, and its beak and legs are a duller brownish-red or orange.

===Similar species===
Within its range the White Stork is distinctive when seen on the ground but, when seen at a distance in flight, it can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns, such as the [[Yellow-billed Stork]], [[Great White Pelican]], and [[Egyptian Vulture]].<ref name=BWP328/> The Yellow-billed Stork is identified by its black tail and a longer, slightly curved, yellow beak.<ref name=SABirds/> The Great White Pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail, and it flies with its neck retracted, keeping its head near to its stocky body, giving it a different flight profile.<ref>Cramp 1977, p. 228.</ref> Pelicans also behave differently, soaring in orderly, synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as the White Stork does.<ref>Svensson and Grant 1999, p. 26.</ref> The Egyptian Vulture is much smaller, with a long wedge-shaped tail, shorter legs and a small yellow-tinged head on a short neck.<ref>Svensson and Grant 1999, p. 74.</ref> The [[Common Crane]], which can also look black and white in strong light, shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight.<ref>Svensson and Grant 1999, p. 34.</ref>

===Migration===
[[File:Whitestorkflock.jpg|thumb|A flock in migration over Israel. Migrating White Storks use the uplift of air [[thermal]]s to reduce the effort of long-distance flying.|alt=A blue sky with many tiny silhouettes of distant flying birds]]

Systematic research into migration began with [[Germany|German]] ornithologist [[Johannes Thienemann]] who commenced  ringing studies in 1906 at the [[Rossitten Bird Observatory]], on the [[Curonian Spit]] in what was then [[East Prussia]]. Although not many storks passed through Rossitten itself, the observatory coordinated the large-scale ringing of the species throughout Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Between 1906 and the [[World War II|Second World War]] about 100,000, mainly juvenile, White Storks were ringed, with over 2,000 long-distance recoveries of birds wearing Rossitten rings reported between 1908 and 1954.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sproll, Alexandra; Fiedler, Wolfgang |year= 2001 |title= Digging in old Data: Migration and Causes of Death in White Storks (''Ciconia ciconia'') according to Ringing Recovery Data of the Vogelwarte Rossitten (Eastern Prussia) before the Second World War |journal= Euring Newsletter |volume= 3 |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.euring.org/about_euring/newsletter3/sproll.htm|publisher=European Union for Bird Ringing}}</ref>

To avoid a long sea crossing over the Mediterranean, birds from central Europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing the [[Bosphorus]] to Turkey, traversing the [[Levant]], then bypassing the [[Sahara Desert]] by following the [[Nile]] valley southwards, or follow a western route over the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1998.tb04539.x|journal = Ibis| volume =140| pages=41<U+2013>52|year=1998| title=Routes of Migrating Soaring Birds| last=Leshem| first=Yossi|coauthors= Yom-Tov, Yoram| url=http://www.tau.ac.il/lifesci/departments/zoology/members/leshem/documents/17.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> These migration corridors maximise help from the thermals and thus save energy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=R.

Juvenile White Storks set off on their first southward migration in an inherited direction but, if displaced from that bearing by weather conditions, they are unable to compensate, and may end up in a new wintering location. Adults can compensate for strong winds and adjust their direction to finish at their normal winter sites, because they are familiar with the location. For the same reason, all spring migrants, even those from displaced wintering locations, can find their way back to the traditional breeding sites.<ref name= newton229>Newton 2010, p. 229.</ref> An experiment with young birds raised in captivity in Kaliningrad and released in the absence of wild storks to show them the way revealed that they appeared to have an instinct to fly south, although the scatter in direction was large.<ref name="Chernetsov2004">{{cite journal|last=Chernetsov, Nikita; Berthold, Peter; Querner, Ulrich|year=2004|title=Migratory Orientation of First-year White Storks (''Ciconia ciconia''): Inherited Information and Social Interactions|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=207|issue=6|pages=937<U+2013>43|issn=0022-0949|doi=10.1242/jeb.00853}}</ref>

====Energetics====
White Storks rely on the uplift of air [[thermal]]s to soar and glide the long distances of their annual migrations between Europe and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. For many, the shortest route would take them over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]; however, since air thermals do not form over water, they generally detour over land to avoid the trans-Mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=British Birds |volume= 95| year=2002| pages=372<U+2013>76| title=Satellite-tracked Lesser Spotted Eagle Avoids Crossing Water at the Gulf of Suez |author=Meyburg, Bernd-U.; Matthes, Joachim; Meyburg, Christiane|url=http://www.dr-meyburg.de/pdfs/a_sp100p/a_sp122.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> It has been estimated that flapping flight metabolises 23 times more body fat than soaring flight per distance travelled.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3677260|author=Spaar, Reto; Bruderer, Bruno |year=1996 | title=Soaring Migration of Steppe Eagles ''Aquila nipalensis'' in Southern Israel: Flight Behaviour under Various Wind and Thermal Conditions| journal = Journal of Avian Biology| volume=27|issue=4| pages=289<U+2013>301| url=http://infonet.vogelwarte.ch/upload/81156449.pdf|format=PDF|jstor=3677260}}</ref> Thus, flocks spiral upwards on rising warm air until they emerge at the top, up to 1200<U+2013>1500&nbsp;m (4000<U+2013>5000&nbsp;ft) above the ground (though one record from Western Sudan observed an altitude of 3300&nbsp;m (10,800&nbsp;ft)).<ref name="Reed69"/>

Long flights over water may occasionally be undertaken. A young White Stork [[Bird ringing|ringed]] at the nest in Denmark subsequently appeared in England, where it spent some days before moving on. It was later seen flying over [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly]], and arrived in a poor condition in [[Madeira]] three days later.

===Communication===
The adult White Stork's main sound is noisy bill-clattering, which has been likened to distant machine gun fire. The bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes. The clattering is amplified by its [[Gular skin|throat pouch]], which acts as a [[resonator]]. Used in a variety of social interactions, bill-clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts, and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situation<U+2014>for example, slower during copulation and briefer when given as an [[Alarm signal|alarm call]]. The only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss; however, young birds can generate a harsh hiss, various cheeping sounds, and a cat-like mew they use to beg for food. Like the adults, young also clatter their beaks.<ref name=BWP334>Cramp 1977, p. 334.</ref> The ''up-down display'' is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. Here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, post coitus, and also as a [[threat display]]. Breeding pairs are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] over the summer, and use this display, as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended.<ref name=BWP333>Cramp 1977, p. 333.</ref>

=== Feeding ===
White Storks consume a wide variety of animal prey. They prefer to forage in meadows that are within roughly 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) of their nest and sites where the vegetation is shorter so that their prey is more accessible.<ref name=Johst/> Their diet varies according to season, locality and prey availability. Common food items include insects (primarily beetles, grasshoppers, locusts and crickets), earthworms, reptiles, amphibians, particularly frog species such as the [[edible frog]]  (''Pelophylax'' kl. ''esculentus'') and [[common frog]] (''Rana temporaria'') and small mammals such as voles, moles, and shrews. Less commonly, they also eat bird eggs and young birds, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and scorpions. They hunt mainly during the day, swallowing small prey whole, but killing and breaking apart larger prey before swallowing.<ref name=BWP332/> Birds returning to Latvia during spring have been shown to locate their prey, moor frogs (''[[Rana arvalis]]''), by homing in on the mating calls produced by aggregations of male frogs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=White Storks ''Ciconia ciconia'' Eavesdrop on Mating Calls of Moor Frogs ''Rana arvalis''|author=Igaune, Kristine; Indrikis Krams; Krama, Tatjana; Bobkova, Jadviga|journal = Journal of Avian Biology|year=2008| volume=39| issue=2|pages= 229<U+2013>32|doi= 10.1111/j.2008.0908-8857.04180.x |url=http://ecolevol.biology.lv/faili/upload/2008_JAB%20Igaune%20Krama%20Krams.pdf}}</ref>

== Parasites and diseases ==

White Stork nests are [[habitat]]s for an array of small arthropods, particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed. Nesting over successive years, the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them. Not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within the nest, but excrement, food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free-living [[mesostigmata|mesostigmatic]] mites. A survey of twelve nests found 13,352 individuals of 34 species, the most common being ''[[Macrocheles merdarius]]'', ''[[Macrocheles robustulus|M.&nbsp;robustulus]]'', ''[[Uroobovella pyriformis]]'' and ''[[Trichouropoda orbicularis]]'', which together represented almost 85% of all the specimens collected. These feed on the eggs and larvae of insects and on [[nematode]]s, which are abundant in the nest litter. These mites are dispersed by [[coprophagia|coprophilous]] beetles, often of the family [[Scarabaeidae]], or on dung brought by the storks during nest construction. Parasitic mites do not occur, perhaps being controlled by the predatory species. The overall impact of the mite population is unclear, the mites may have a role in suppressing harmful organisms (and hence be beneficial), or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings.<ref name=bloszyk2005 >{{cite journal | last= B<U+0142>oszyk | first= Jerzy | coauthors= Gwiazdowicz, Dariusz J.; Bajerlein, Daria; Halliday, Robert Bruce | year=2005 | title= Nests of the White Stork ''Ciconia ciconia'' (L.) as a Habitat for Mesostigmatic Mites (Acari, Mesostigmata) | journal= Acta Parasitologica | volume= 50 | issue = 2 | pages= 171<U+2013>75 | url = http://www.actaparasitologica.pan.pl/archive/PDF/Bloszyk.pdf |format =PDF | doi = }}</ref><ref name= Bajerlein >{{cite journal | last= Bajerlein | first= Daria | coauthors= B<U+0142>oszyk, Jerzy; Gwiazdowicz, Dariusz J.; Ptaszyk, Jerzy; Halliday, Bruce | year= 2006 | title= Community Structure and Dispersal of Mites (Acari, Mesostigmata) in Nests of the White Stork (''Ciconia ciconia'') | journal= Biologia | volume= 61 | issue = 5 | pages= 525<U+2013>30 | doi = 10.2478/s11756-006-0086-9 }}</ref>

== Conservation  ==
The White Stork's decline due to [[industrialisation]] and agricultural changes (principally the draining of wetlands and conversion of meadows to crops such as [[maize]]) began in the 19th century: the last wild individual in Belgium was seen in 1895, in Sweden in 1955, in Switzerland in 1950 and in Holland in 1991.

A large population of White Storks breeds in central and eastern Europe. In a 2004 census, there were 52,500 pairs in Poland, 12,000<U+2013>18,000 pairs in Ukraine, 10,500<U+2013>13,000 pairs in [[Belarus]], 10,000 pairs in Lithuania (the highest known density of this species in the world), and 8,500 pairs in Latvia. In Estonia the population has also been increasing, numbering about 4,000 pairs in 2004. There were around 5,000 pairs in Romania and an estimated 4,818 breeding pairs in Bulgaria.<ref name=nabu>{{cite web|title=Preliminary Results of the VI International White Stork Census 2004/05|url=http://bergenhusen.nabu.de/zensus/zensus2006/worldpopulation.pdf|publisher= Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU)|accessdate=10 December 2010}}</ref> In Germany, 3,000 of the total 3,400 pairs are in the former [[East Germany]].

In the 1980s, the population had fallen to fewer than nine pairs in the entire upper [[Rhine River]] valley, an area closely identified with the White Stork for centuries.

===Storks and childbirth===
According to northern European legend, the stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents. The legend is very ancient, but was popularised by a 19th century [[Hans Christian Andersen]] story called ''The Storks''.<ref name= sax>{{cite book| last = Sax | first = Boria | title = The Mythical Zoo | year = 2001| location = Oxford, UK | publisher = ABC-CLIO | isbn = 1576076121|pages = 153<U+2013>54}}</ref> German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks. These caves contained ''adebarsteine'' or "stork stones". The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney. Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill.<ref name=Margolis72/><!-- cites previous four sentences --> From there the folklore has spread around the world to countries  such as the Philippines and South America.<ref name=Margolis72/>

Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] to the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]], and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage (depicting purity), size (in that it is big enough to carry an infant), and flight at high altitude (likened to flying between Earth and Heaven).<ref name=Margolis72/> The fable and its relation to the internal world of the child have been discussed by [[Sigmund Freud]],<ref name=Margolis72/> and [[Carl Jung]].<ref name="Jung10">{{cite journal|last=Jung|first=Carl|year=1910|title=The Association Method <U+2013> Lecture III: Experiences Concerning the Psychic Life of the Child|journal=American Journal of Psychology |volume=31 |pages=219<U+2013>69 |jstor=1422691|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/Association/lecture3.htm |accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref> In fact, Jung recalled being told the story himself upon the birth of his own sister.<ref name="Jung10">{{cite web|last=Pickles|first=Penny|year=2011|title=Jung the Man| publisher= The Society of Analytical Psychology| work= The Society of Analytical Psychology: Jungian Analysis and Psychotherapy|location=London|url=http://www.thesap.org.uk/jung-the-man|accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref> The traditional link with the newborn continues with their use in [[advertising]] for such products as [[diaper|nappies]] and [[baby announcement|birth announcements]].<ref name=Margolis72/>

There were negative aspects to stork folklore as well; a Polish folk tale relates how God made the stork's plumage white, while the Devil gave it black wings, imbuing it with both good and evil impulses. They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany, explained as the stork having dropped the baby ''en route'' to the household, or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing. A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been "bitten" by the stork.<ref name=Margolis72/> In Denmark, storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years.<ref name=Margolis72/> In medieval England, storks were also associated with adultery, possibly inspired by their courtship rituals. Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self-conceit.<ref name="deVries76">{{cite book |last=de Vries |first=Ad |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery |year=1976 |page=445|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=0-7204-8021-3}}</ref>
