An '''Italian beef''' is a [[sandwich]] of thin slices of seasoned [[roast beef]], dripping with meat juices, on a dense, long [[Italian bread|Italian-style roll]], which originated in [[Chicago]] where its history dates back at least to the 1930s.<ref name="Chicagoan">{{cite news |first=Leah A |last=Zeldes |title=How to Eat Like a Chicagoan |url=http://www.chicagorestaurant.com/show_article.php?aID=13 |work=Chicago's Restaurant Guide |publisher=Chicago's Restaurant Guide |date=2002-09-30 |accessdate=2002-09-30 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021001023605/www.chicagorestaurant.com/show_article.php?aID=13 |archivedate=2002-10-01}}</ref> The bread itself is often dipped (or double-dipped) into the juices the meat is cooked in, and the sandwich is typically topped off with Chicago-style [[giardiniera]] (called "hot") or sauteed, green [[Italian sweet pepper]]s (called "sweet").

Italian beef sandwiches can be found at most [[Chicago-style hot dog|hot dog]] stands and small Italian-American restaurants throughout [[Chicagoland]].  They are difficult to find outside of northeastern [[Illinois]] and [[Northwest Indiana]].  However, Chicago expatriates have opened restaurants across the country serving Italian beef, [[Chicago-style hot dog]]s, and other foods original to the Chicago area.

==Preparation==
Italian beef is made using cuts of beef from the sirloin rear or the top/bottom round wet-[[Roasting|roasted]] in [[broth]] with garlic, oregano and spices until [[medium rare]] or medium. The roast is then cooled, shaved using a deli slicer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=resources/lifestyle_community/food/recipes&id=7953643 |title=Italian Beef Pizza &#124; abc7chicago.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2011-02-12 |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref> and then reintroduced to its reheated beef broth. The beef then sits in the broth, typically for hours. Once a sandwich is ordered, the beef is then drawn from the broth and placed directly on the bread. Because the meat is served dripping wet it is necessary to use a chewy bread, as a softer bread would disintegrate. The typical bread used is long, Italian style loaves without seeds sliced from six to eight inches in length.  Italian beef can also be shredded instead of sliced.

Many retailers purchase pre-seasoned, pre-cooked, and pre-sliced Italian beef with separate cooking broth ("au jus"), and then heat and serve, while the most acclaimed Chicago beef places typically prepare the beef on their own premises according to their own recipes. Some produce their own homemade [[giardiniera]] as well.

==Origins==
Origins of the sandwich are disputed, but one early vendor, Al's No. 1 Italian Beef, opened its first stand in 1938.<ref name="Chicagoan" />

One story has it that the Italian Beef sandwich was started by Italian immigrants who worked for the old [[Union Stock Yards]]. They often would bring home some of the tougher, less desirable cuts of beef sold by the company. To make the meat more palatable, it was slow-roasted to make it more tender, then slow-simmered in a spicy broth for flavor.  Both the roasting and the broth used Italian-style spices and herbs. The meat was then thinly sliced across the grain and stuffed into fresh Italian bread.

According to Scala's Original Beef and Sausage Company (formed in 1925), this meal was originally introduced at weddings and banquets where the meat was sliced thinly so there would be enough to feed all the guests. It rapidly grew in popularity and eventually became one of Chicago's most famous ethnic foods: the original Italian beef sandwich.<ref>[http://www.scalasoriginal.com/history Scala's Beef history]</ref>

By 1954, a local restaurant [[Al's Beef]] was advertising its "Pizza, Spaghetti, Ravioli, [and] Italian Beef Sandwiches" in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.<ref>"Barsanti's Grill" advertisement. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. November 14, 1954. p 3-8.</ref>

==Variations==
There are varying degrees of juiciness, depending on taste. Nomenclature varies from stand to stand, but ''wet'' or ''dipped'' means the bread is quickly dunked in the juice; ''juicy'' even wetter; and ''soaked'' is dripping wet.

Most Chicago beef joints also offer a "combo," adding a grilled [[Italian sausage]] to the sandwich. Different eateries offer hot or mild sausage, or both.

Typical beef orders are:

* ''Hot dipped:'' Italian beef on gravy-wetted bread and giardiniera.
* ''Hot dipped combo:'' Italian beef and sausage on gravy-wetted bread with giardiniera.
* ''Sweet dry:'' Italian beef placed on dry bread, topped with sweet peppers.
* ''Gravy bread:'' meatless Italian bread soaked in the juice of Italian beef,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagojoes.net/sandwiches1.htm |title=Sandwiches |publisher=Chicagojoes.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-10}}</ref> often served with peppers or giardiniera.  Also known in some places as "Soakers" or "Juice-ons".
* ''Cheesy beef'' or ''cheef:'' Italian beef with [[cheese]] ([[Provolone]], [[Mozzarella]] or, rarely, [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]]); not all stands offer this.
* ''Cheesy beef on garlic'': Italian beef with cheese (Provolone, Mozzarella or, rarely, Cheddar) and the bread being pre-cooked and seasoned like traditional garlic bread; not all stands offer this.

Some order the "triple double," which consists of double cheese, double sausage and double beef. Other even less common variations include substituting Italian bread with a large [[croissant]] or topping with [[marinara sauce]].

==In the media==
The Italian beef sandwich was featured in a [[Man v. Food (season 1)|late 2008 episode]] of the [[Travel Channel]]'s ''[[Man v. Food]]'', when host [[Adam Richman (actor)|Adam Richman]] (who focused his restaurant visits on Chicago in that episode) visited Al's No. 1 Italian Beef to try the signature sandwich.

The sandwich was mentioned in the 1999 [[History Channel]] documentary ''American Eats: History on a Bun'' as an example of the specialty sandwiches found in different cities in the United States.  Chris Pacelli, owner of Al's No. 1 Italian Beef, is shown demonstrating how to eat the sandwich with the "Italian stance."

Al's Beef was also featured on ''[[Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America]]'' in 2012, where Richman declared the Italian beef sandwich the best sandwich in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].
