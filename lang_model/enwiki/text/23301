The '''Great Fish River''' (called ''great'' to distinguish it from the [[Namibia]]n [[Fish River, Nambia|Fish River]]) ({{lang-af|Groot-Visrivier}})<ref>[http://myfundi.co.za/a/Riviere_van_Suid-Afrika Riviere van Suid-Afrika]</ref> is a river running {{convert|644|km|mi}} through the [[South Africa]]n province of the [[Eastern Cape]]. The coastal area between [[Port Elizabeth]] and the Fish River mouth is known as the ''Sunshine Coast''. The Great Fish River was originally named ''Rio do Infante'', after [[Jo<U+00E3>o Infante]], the captain of one of the caravels of [[Bartolomeu Dias]]. Infante visited the river in the late 1480s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter Edmund |last=Raper ||title=Dictionary of Southern African Place Names|url=http://archive.org/details/DictionaryOfSouthernAfricanPlaceNames|publisher=Human Science Research Council|location=Johannesburg|year=1987}} (public domain)</ref>

==Course==
The Great Fish River originates east of [[Graaff-Reinet]] and runs through [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]]. Further south the [[Tarka River]] joins its left bank. Thence it makes a jig-jag turn to [[Cookhouse]], from where it meanders down the escarpment east of [[Grahamstown]] before its final near-straight run to its estuary 8 km northeast of [[Seafield, Eastern Cape|Seafield]], into the [[Indian Ocean]]. 

The river is generally permanent, having water all year round, although its headwaters rise in an arid region, and the natural flow can be sluggish in the dry season beyond the ebb and flow of the tidal reaches; now, water from the Orange River system can be used to keep up its flow in dry periods. The river is tidal for approximately 20&nbsp;km.

Its main tributaries are the [[Groot Brak River (Eastern Cape)|Groot Brak River]], the [[Tarka River]] and the [[Kat River]] on the left side, and the Little Fish River ({{lang-af|Klein-Visrivier}}) on the right side.
The Great Fish River is part of the [[Fish to Tsitsikama]] [[Water Management Area]].<ref>[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/iwqs/rhp/eco/FROC/WMA15FishTsitsikamma.jpg Fish to Tsitsikama WMA 15]</ref>

==Dams on the basin==
* [[Egerton Dam]]
* [[Elandsdrift Dam]]

==Climate==
River mouth: The climate is temperate with around 650mm of rainfall that falls mainly during spring and autumn. Mean temperatures range from 12<U+00B0>C to 24<U+00B0>C with extremes as low as 2<U+00B0>C or as high as 40<U+00B0>C.

==Ecology==
In the 1970s, a major water project brought Orange River water, via the Fish River, for agricultural and industrial use. The [[Orange<U+2013>Fish River Tunnel|tunnel]] for this was a major engineering undertaking, with the intake at [[Oviston]] (an acronym, in Afrikaans, for Orange-Fish Tunnel). Oviston is on the shores of the [[Gariep Dam]].
A hydro-electric generating plant is placed at the Fish River egress, but is uneconomic and is not in use.

Mixing of waters from two watersheds has been environmentally disastrous - much of the Fish River ecosystem is now taken over by Orange River flora and fauna.

===Flora===
River mouth: Valley thicket, dune thicket, riparian vegetation and [[fynbos]]. The [[Giant Eastern Cape Cycad]] and the White and [[Red Milkwood]] are protected trees. Other significant species include the acacia, [[Dombeya rotundifolia|white pear]], [[Schotia afra|Karoo boer-bean]], strelitzia, [[Acokanthera oblongifolia|dune poison bush]], [[Harpephyllum caffrum|wild plum]], coral tree and [[Zanthoxylum capense|small knobwood]].

===Fauna===
There is a small population of the [[endangered]] [[Eastern Province rocky]] ''(Sandelia bainsii)'' in the Kat River, part of the Great Fish river basin.<ref>[http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/19889/all Sandelia bainsii]</ref> 

The Fish River mouth area supports several species of large and small mammals including five antelope species, bushpigs, various rodent species including [[mongoose]], [[hyrax]], hares, rats and mice, bats, and the shy [[African Wild Cat]], the Small Spotted [[Genet (animal)|Genet]], [[Striped Polecat]] and the [[Cape porcupine]]. The most commonly viewed wild mammal is the [[Vervet Monkey]], which has been known to grab food under the nose of unsuspecting guests at the Fish River Sun Resort.
There are over 135 species of marine and terrestrial birds found along the river including the colourful [[Knysna Lourie]] and Giant Kingfisher and the majestic Fish Eagle.
There are 26 species of snakes, of which only five are venomous.

==History==
During the 19th century, the river formed the border of the [[Cape Colony]]<ref name="teal-1894-87">{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=South Africa (the Cape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State, South African Republic, and all other territories south of the Zambesi)|publisher=Unwin|location=London|year=1894|pages=87<U+2013>88|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/southafricatheca00theauoft#page/87/mode/1up|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref> and was hotly contested during the [[Xhosa Wars]] of 1779 to 1878 between the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] nation on the one side and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] farmers and the [[1820 Settlers]] from [[England]] on the other,<ref name="bantu_tribes-333">{{cite book|authors=Doke,Clement M.; Dart,Raymond A.; Goodwin,A.J.H.; Marais,J.S.; Eiselen,W.M.|title=The Bantu Speaking Tribes Of South Africa|publisher=Routledge And Kegan Paul Limited|year=1962|pages=333<U+2013>334|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/bantuspeakingtri032916mbp#page/n380/mode/1up}}</ref> and in 1835, the [[Fingo (Mfengu)|Fingo]] tribe was permitted to settle on the river's banks. During [[apartheid]], the lower reaches formed the western boundary of the nominally independent [[Ciskei]] homeland.
Between 1846 and 1847, the Fish River mouth area became a hive of activity during the War of the Axe, one of several frontier wars at the time between the Xhosa nation and the British colonists. A ferry was constructed at the Fish River to link the Cape Colony (western side of the river) with Waterloo Bay (the small bay near the mouth of Old Woman<U+2019>s River which now flows through the Fish River Sun resort). Waterloo Bay, named after the first ship which unloaded cargo in the bay, served as a landing place for soldiers and supplies in the war. Several ships wrecked along the Fish River coast during these years.<ref name="military">[http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol085vw.html]</ref>
The following are notable historical sites at the Fish River mouth, mostly encompassed within the Fish River Sun Resort premises which the establishment has endeavoured to protect:

=== Maitland Military Camp ===
The main military camp was on the eastern bank of the Old Woman<U+2019>s River, called Cape Maitland, in honour of Sir Peregrine Maitland, Governor of the Cape Colony. The name was later changed to Fort Albert in honour of Queen Victoria<U+2019>s husband. The camp consisted of huts and tents surrounded by an earthwork and was abandoned at the end of the war. The camp site was <U+2018>rediscovered<U+2019> when large quantities of artifacts were unearthed during the construction of the Fish River Sun golf course.<ref name="military" />

=== Broxholm Cottage ===
A certain Sergeant C. Broxholm is rumoured to have built the only structure that survived the war, located on the eastern side of the river. Built in 1846, he sold the building a year later to Mr. J Kidd of the Wesleyan Missionary Society who hoped to undertake missionary work at Waterloo Bay.

=== Soldier<U+2019>s Cemetery ===
Some of the soldiers that died during the occupation of Waterloo Bay were buried in a small cemetery near the eastern bank of the Old Woman<U+2019>s River. The graves were not marked but it is believed that members of the 6th and 45th regiments and Cape Levy were buried there. A clearing among the dune scrub marks the site on the Fish River Sun Resort property.<ref name="military" />

=== Civilian Camp ===
A large civilian camp with the accompanying trading stores and inns which followed the military activities was apparently situated on the western side of the Old Woman<U+2019>s River. All historical remains are currently covered by the golf playing surface.<ref name="military" />

=== Shipwrecks ===
The remains of the vessels ''Catherine'' and ''Justina'' can still be seen by divers. The ships were wrecked in the 1840s and are located within 1&nbsp;km of the mouth of the Fish River.<ref name="military" />

==Economy==
===Recreation===
*Despite its name, fishing that takes place along its (mainly lower) reaches is primarily recreational.
*Annually, the [[Fish River Canoe Marathon]], a popular canoeing event takes place over two days from Grassridge Dam to [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]].
*Diving in the area of the River's mouth is quite an experience, thanks to the numerous shipwrecks which can be found: the SS ''Cariboo'', the SS ''Kilbrennan'' and the ''Waterloo'', to name a few.

===Fish River Sun Hotel and Country Club Resort===
The Fish River Sun Hotel and Country Club Resort is a Sun International resort destination at the mouth of the Fish River on the south-eastern coastline of South Africa. 
The Fish River Sun opened its doors in March 1989 as a hotel and casino. The 184 000 hectare property on the eastern banks of the Fish River fell within the then Ciskei region, a former Bantustan homeland during the apartheid administration. The hotel, casino and golf course continued to be a popular and successful tourism attraction in the region, mostly due to the casino as licenses are awarded sparingly in South Africa. 
The resort establishment suffered a huge knock when its casino license was not extended after its ten-year period, ending in 1999. The accommodation format was converted from a hotel to a vacation club functioning on a timeshare basis. The Eastern Cape Gambling Board granted another casino license in nearby Port Elizabeth, also operated by Sun International, in the Boardwalk Casino and Entertainment World Complex. As part of the license bid, the Boardwalk agreed to supplement the costs of maintaining the Fish River Sun as part of its obligation to rural development in the province.
Activities include swimming, guided nature walks, golf, dune boarding, canoeing, fishing, mini-golf, and even spa treatments.
Golf course The resort<U+2019>s greatest attraction is its golf course, designed by Gary Player and rated in the top 30 golf courses in South Africa 
.<ref name="golf"><http://www.golfdirect.co.za/top100sacourses.php></ref> Although the course is situated adjacent to the beach, it is not classified as links. The course has hosted some large events including the Africa Open in 2008.

==Great Fish Point==
Great Fish Point is a [[lighthouse]] situated near the mouth of the Great Fish River, about 25&nbsp;km from the coastal holiday resort of [[Port Alfred]].

Before the lighthouse was built in 1898, two ship's lamps exhibiting fixed green lights were erected on a flagstaff at Port Alfred, but these lights later proved to be inadequate. The clockwork system which used to drive the lens is still intact and on display.

Although the lighthouse itself is only 9 meters high, it is situated 76 meters above sea level.
