[[EMI]] released the album in most of the world, while in the United States and Canada it was released jointly by [[Universal Music Enterprises]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment]] - the successor to the [[Sanctuary Records]]/[[Columbia Records]] joint venture that had previously controlled the Iron Maiden catalogue in North America.

==Overview==
On 22 April 2009, during a ''Rock Radio'' interview promoting ''[[Iron Maiden: Flight 666]]'', [[Nicko McBrain]] mentioned that [[Iron Maiden]] had booked studio time for early 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockradio.co.uk/rock-news/nicko-maiden-have-booked-studio-time/v38r73fs/|title=Nicko: Maiden have booked studio time|accessdate=22 April 2009|date=22 April 2009|publisher=[[Rock Radio]]}}</ref> On June 8, the album artwork, release date, and track listing were revealed, along with a free download of the track "[[El Dorado (song)|El Dorado]]".<ref name="maiden 7 June announcement"/> The album was released as a regular CD, an [[iTunes LP]], a [[music download|digital download]], and a limited collector's "Mission Edition", containing interviews and a game entitled ''Mission II: Rescue & Revenge''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=8&p2_articleid=1231|title=Iron Maiden announce the video premiere of 'The Final Frontier'|publisher=Iron Maiden official website|date=13 July 2010|accessdate=13 July 2010}}</ref>

==Production==
On 2 November 2009, [[Janick Gers]] confirmed to [[BBC News]] that the band already had new material written and would head to [[Paris, France]], to start composing and rehearsing the bulk of the new album. The band took time off for Christmas and New Year's Eve before recording the new album in January, with [[Kevin Shirley]] producing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8338887.stm|title=Rolling Stone Wood wins rock gong |publisher=BBC|date=3 November 2009|accessdate=27 November 2009}}</ref> On 6 April, Shirley told ''[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]]'' that he had completed mixing the album,<ref name="Blabbermouth">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=138057|title=Producer KEVIN SHIRLEY Completes Mixing New IRON MAIDEN Album|publisher=Blabbermouth|date=6 April 2010|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> and commented on the final stages of its production on 6 May:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=139675|title=Producer KEVIN SHIRLEY: 'IRON MAIDEN Are The Best Band In The World To Work For' - May&nbsp;6, 2010|publisher=Blabbermouth|date=6 May 2010|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> Regarding the band's return to [[Compass Point Studios]], where they had previously recorded in the 1980s, Dickinson remarked: ''<blockquote><U+201C>The studio had the same vibe and it was exactly as it had been in 1983, nothing had changed! Even down to the broken shutter in the corner... same carpet... everything... It was really quite spooky.  But we felt very relaxed in such a familiar and well-trodden environment and I think this shows in the playing and the atmosphere of the album.<U+201D><ref name="maiden 7 June announcement">{{cite web|url=http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=8&p2_articleid=1213|title=MAIDEN ANNOUNCE RELEASE DATE, ARTWORK AND TRACKLISTING FOR NEW ALBUM <U+201C>THE FINAL FRONTIER<U+201D> TOUR STARTS THIS WEEK|publisher=Iron Maiden official website|date=7 June 2010|accessdate=8 June 2010}}</ref></blockquote>''

==Songs==
The album is the fourth for which [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] receives writing credits for every track, following ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'', ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'', and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (album)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''.

"[[El Dorado (song)|El Dorado]]" was released as a free digital download on the band's official website on 8 June and went on to win in the [[Best Metal Performance]] category at the [[53rd Grammy Awards|2011 Grammy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees|title=53rd Grammy Awards Winners|publisher=Grammys|date=13 February 2011|accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref> The album's first and only [[music video]] was released on 13 July, filmed in [[Rendlesham Forest]] and containing the latter half of "[[Satellite 15... The Final Frontier]]". Although the album has no official [[Single (music)|single]] releases, both "[[El Dorado (song)|El Dorado]]" and the second part of "[[Satellite 15... The Final Frontier]]" (along with its music video) were released as promo radio singles before the album's release. "[[Coming Home (Iron Maiden song)|Coming Home]]" was also released as a radio single on 27 October,  featuring an alternative "radio edit" version of the song.<ref>{{cite web|title=IRON MAIDEN Announce New Radio Single; 'Coming Home'|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/149297|publisher=Brave Words and Bloody Knuckles|accessdate=20 December 2010|date=27 October 2010}}</ref>

In a 1 July interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]] commented that the album mixes "straight-ahead, uptempo rock songs with good grooves with some other tracks that are kind of longer and more complex", referring particularly to "[[When the Wild Wind Blows (song)|When the Wild Wind Blows]]", the band's third longest song to date, after "[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner (song)|Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]" and "Sign of the Cross":<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/news#/news/iron-maiden-explores-the-final-frontier-1004101855.story|title=Iron Maiden Explores 'The Final Frontier'|publisher=Billboard|date=1 July 2010|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref> Interviewed for ''[[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate Guitar]]'' on 15 July, [[Janick Gers]] discussed the album's overall sound: "We're taking it to extremes. The one song we released isn't indicative of the rest of the album. There's so many different feels and ways of playing. We go through some different attitudes and take you to different places. There's a lot of thematic tunes and some very varied music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/why_maiden_arent_playing_what_you_want.html|title=Why Maiden Aren't Playing What You Want|publisher=Ultimate Guitar|date=15 July 2010|accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>

"[[El Dorado (song)|El Dorado]]", "[[Coming Home (Iron Maiden song)|Coming Home]]" and "When the Wild Wind Blows" will be featured on the "Best Of" album ''[[From Fear to Eternity (Iron Maiden album)|From Fear to Eternity]]''.
