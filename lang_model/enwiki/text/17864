==Biography==
===Early life===
Kravitz was born in [[New York City]], [[New York]] on [[May 26]], [[1964]], the son of [[Roxie Roker]], an actress known for her character [[Jeffersons supporting characters#Helen Douglas Willis|Helen Willis]] in the 1970s hit television sitcom ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', and [[Sy Kravitz]], an [[NBC]] television news producer. Kravitz's father was of [[Russian Jewish]] descent<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3245845.ece The face - Times Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and his mother was of [[Bahamian]] descent. Kravitz was named after his uncle, [[Private First Class|Pfc.]] Leonard Kravitz, who was killed in action on March 6, 1951 near [[Yangpyeong]], [[Korea]] at the age of 20. PFC. Kravitz fearlessly defended against a surprise Chinese Army attack, saving most of his platoon; he was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], the second highest military decoration of the [[United States Army]].<ref>Harrison, Donald H.

Kravitz grew up spending weekdays on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] with his parents, and weekends at his grandmother Bessie Roker's house in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. Kravitz began banging on pots and pans in the kitchen, playing them as drums at the age of three. At the age of five, he wanted to be a musician. He began playing the [[Drum kit|drums]] and soon added [[guitar]]. Kravitz grew up listening to the music his parents listened to: [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[jazz]], [[classical music|classical]], [[opera]], [[gospel music|gospel]], and [[blues]]. "My parents were very supportive of the fact that I loved music early on, and they took me to a lot of shows," Kravitz said.<ref name="Henderson2002">Henderson. (2002).</ref> Around the age of 7, he saw [[The Jackson 5]] perform at [[Madison Square Garden]], which became his favorite group.<ref name="guardian2002">Hodgkinson, Will (July 5, 2002). "[http://www.guardian.co.uk/friday_review/story/0%2C3605%2C749062%2C00.html Lenny Kravitz]". ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref> His father, who was also a jazz promoter, was friends with [[Duke Ellington]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Count Basie]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Bobby Short]], [[Miles Davis]] and other jazz greats. Ellington even played "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]" for him one year when he was about 5.<ref name="ebony1994"/> He was exposed to the [[soul music]] of [[Motown Records|Motown]], [[Stax Records|Stax]], [[James Brown]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Al Green]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Gladys Knight]], [[The Isley Brothers]] and [[Gamble and Huff]] growing up, key influences on his musical style. Kravitz often went to see New York [[theatre|theater]], where his mother worked. His mother encouraged his dreams of pursuing music.

In 1974, the Kravitz family relocated to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] when Kravitz's mother landed her role on ''The Jeffersons''. At his mother's urging, Kravitz joined the California Boys Choir for three years, where he performed a classical repertoire, and sang with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. He performed in [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. It was in Los Angeles that Kravitz was first introduced to [[rock music]], listening to [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]], and [[The Who]].<ref name="guardian2002"/> "I was attracted to the cool style, the girls, the rock 'n' roll lifestyle," Kravitz said.<ref name="guardian2002"/> Kravitz's other musical influences at the time included [[Fela Kuti]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Miles Davis]];<ref name="guardian2002"/> [[John Lennon]] and [[Bob Marley]] proved later to be influential as well. Kravitz attended [[Beverly Hills High School]]. [[Maria McKee]] and guitarist Saul Hudson (better known as [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]) were his classmates. In 1978, Kravitz was accepted into the school's well-respected music program. He taught himself to play [[piano]] and [[bass (guitar)|bass]], and made friends with [[Zoro (drummer)|Zoro]] who would later become his long-time collaborator.<ref>Evans, Mia "[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/Zoro113006.aspx The Faith of Zoro]". ''CBN.com''. Retrieved on March 13, 2007.</ref> Kravitz wanted to be a [[session musician]]. He also appeared as an actor in television commercials during this time. 

Kravitz went to school enough to pass, but was spending more and more time [[Jam session|jamming]] with friends. His parents became concerned, wanting him to have something to fall back on. At the age of 15, determined to have a music career, Kravitz moved out of his house. He stayed with friends, slept in friends' cars, and at one point was even sleeping in his [[Ford Pinto]]. Inspired by [[David Bowie]], Kravitz adopted the [[nom de guerre]], "Romeo Blue," a new persona complete with [[straightened hair]] and blue contact lenses, and began performing. Kravitz's music at this time was heavily influenced by the synth-laden funk pop of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. In 1982, Kravitz graduated from [[Beverly Hills High School]] and convinced his father to give him money to record instead of spending money on college. With his first [[demo (music)|demo]], Kravitz received offers from several record labels, including [[I.R.S. Records]], but Kravitz was told he needed to change his music to make it "black enough" to fit in with current radio-friendly [[R & B]] styles. "I refused," Kravitz told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1989.<ref name="Henderson2002"/>

==Personal life==
In 1985, Kravitz's parents divorced, which had a profound impact on him. His relationship with his father became extremely strained. Kravitz focused on his music to help him get through this period. That year, Kravitz met actress [[Lisa Bonet]] backstage at a [[New Edition]] concert. Bonet worked on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', the number one rated show on television. They were close friends for two years before falling in love. Kravitz moved back to New York City where ''The Cosby Show'' was produced in 1987, moving in with now girlfriend Bonet. Kravitz and Bonet [[elope]]d on November 16, 1987, her 20th birthday, in a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] ceremony. Kravitz, still known as Romeo Blue at the time, suddenly found himself in the headlines of [[tabloid]] newspapers. They had a daughter, [[Zoe Kravitz|Zo<U+00EB> Isabella Kravitz]], born on December 1, 1988. Kravitz and Bonet divorced in 1993.

Kravitz identifies himself as both a Christian "through choice" and a Jew, which he described both as "all the same to me".<ref>{{cite news | title=Bursting rock's balloon | url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/K/Kravitz_Lenny/1996/02/05/746706.html | accessdate=2007-11-29 | date=5 February 1996 | first=Jane | last=Stevenson | publisher=[[Jam!]]/Canoe }}</ref> He also notes that spirituality "has been an important issue in my growth", given his upbringing by parents of different faiths.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4495463 | title=Lenny Kravitz Takes Spiritual Turn on 'Baptism' | publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] | accessdate=2007-11-29 | first=Scott | last=Simon | date=12 February 2005 }}</ref> Such spirituality is prominently featured on many of his songs, such as the lyrics on his album ''Baptism'', and   having his back inscribed with a tattoo stating, "My Heart Belongs to Jesus Christ."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/glimpses/2004/baptism.html | title=Glimpses of God: Lenny Kravitz / Baptism | first=Russ | last=Breimeier | accessdate=2007-11-29 | date=2004 | publisher=''[[Christianity Today]]'' }}</ref> During another interview, he quipped "I'm half Jewish, I'm half black, I look in-between."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.lenny-kravitz.com/interviewdeepjoy.html | accessdate=2007-11-29 | publisher=''Deep Joy'' | date=1998 | first=Tracey | last=Pepper | title=Lenny's 5 }}</ref>

In September 2007, Nicole Kidman made the news, in the issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', when she revealed that she was secretly engaged with someone after her divorce with [[Tom Cruise]] and before her wedding with [[Keith Urban]]. Many sources reported that the "mystery man" was Lenny Kravitz. Neither Kravitz's representant or Kidman's representant confirmed or denied the rumor.

==Career==
===1989-1990: Virgin Records and the career d<U+00E9>but===
With record labels still telling him his music wasn't "black enough" or "white enough," Kravitz decided to record an album on his own. Kravitz had met [[recording engineer]]/[[keyboardist]]/[[bassist]] Henry Hirsch in 1985 when recording a demo at his [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] [[recording studio]]. The two shared an interest in using real instruments and vintage recording equipment, as well as a love of R&B, jazz, and rock. Kravitz would go on to collaborate with Hirsch on most of his albums. Kravitz began working on his debut album with Hirsch over the next year and a half, with Kravitz's father paying for the studio time.  Kravitz met [[saxophonist]] [[Karl Denson]] and invited him to play on the song, "Let Love Rule". Kravitz was so impressed with his playing that Denson played on much of the album. Denson toured with Kravitz for the next 5 years. After completing the album, Kravitz met with [[Virgin Records]]. The label was excited about the music he was making, music inspired by his relationship with wife Bonet and their new daughter. Kravitz dropped the name Romeo Blue. About his time as Romeo Blue, Kravitz said, "Ultimately, it got me back to myself. And when I finally did accept myself for myself, music started flowing out of me."<ref name="Henderson2002"/> Kravitz signed with Virgin Records in 1989.

Kravitz released his debut album ''[[Let Love Rule]]'' on September 6, 1989, a combination of rock and funk with a general 1960s vibe. Music critics were mixed: some felt Kravitz was a gifted new artist, others felt he was overpowered by his musical influences. The album was a moderate success in the United States,  but became huge outside of the US, especially in [[Europe]]. Lisa Bonet directed and appeared in his debut music video for the title track, "Let Love Rule". Kravitz set out on the road, first on a club tour, and then an opening slot for [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]].

===1991-1996: Popularity established===
In 1990, Kravitz co-wrote with Ingrid Chavez and produced the song "[[Justify My Love]]" for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

Kravitz separated from Lisa Bonet in 1991,<ref name="behindthemusic">"Behind The Music: Lenny Kravitz". (1999).</ref> amid rumors of an affair between him and Madonna. Kravitz has denied any infidelity.<ref name="behindthemusic"/> Kravitz and Bonet divorced in 1993.

In 1991, Kravitz produced the self-titled album ''[[Vanessa Paradis (album)|Vanessa Paradis]]'' for French singer and actress [[Vanessa Paradis]].

The songs on the album were about Bonet and dedicated to her, documenting his depression over their breakup.<ref name="ebony1994">Norment, Lynn (June 1994).

During the presentation of the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], he performed the song with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] of [[Led Zeppelin]] on bass. Several singles from the album would follow including, "Believe", "Is There Any Love In Your Heart", and "Heaven Help/Spinning Around Over You". This album was the first to  feature guitarist [[Craig Ross]], who has also played on all his subsequent albums<ref>[http://craigross.net/ Craig Ross Official Site]</ref>.  One song, "Eleutheria", was influenced by the island [[Eleuthera]] in [[The Bahamas]] where Kravitz built a house and recording studio at that time.<ref name="ebony1994"/> In 1993, he also released the EP, ''Spinning Around Over You'', which included four live tracks from his "Universal Love Tour".

In 1995, Lenny Kravitz released the album ''[[Circus (Lenny Kravitz album)|Circus]]'', which went to number 10 on the Billboard chart on the back of his past achievement. However, the album only had two hit singles: "[[Rock and Roll Is Dead]]" and "Can't Get You Off My Mind".

===1997-2000: Increasing success, ''5'' and first Grammy Awards===

With ''[[5 (Lenny Kravitz album)|5]]'' (1998), Kravitz embraced digital technology such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]s for the first time.  ''5'' introduced his music to an even wider audience thanks to the hit single "[[Fly Away (Lenny Kravitz song)|Fly Away]]" being featured prominently in both [[automobile|car]] manufacturer and [[airline]] commercials. ''5'' would reach #28 on the Billboard 200, with "Fly Away" reaching #1 on multiple charts. He would win the first of his four consecutive [[Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance]] at the [[Grammy Awards of 1999]]. Other hits from the album included "If You Can't Say No", that was also remixed by dance producer [[Brian Transeau]], and "[[I Belong to You (Lenny Kravitz song)|I Belong to You]]". For the [[I Belong to You (Lenny Kravitz song)|I Belong to You]] video Lenny can be seen without his signature [[dreadlocks]].

His [[cover version]] of [[The Guess Who| The Guess Who's]] hit "[[American Woman (song)|American Woman]]" won him another Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2000]] and helped The Guess Who's song reach a new audience. Kravitz's version of the song originally came from the soundtrack of ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' and was added to ''5'' as a bonus track in 1999.

Lenny worked on two songs for [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'' album released in 2001, but those tracks are still unreleased.

Kravitz released a ''[[Greatest Hits (Lenny Kravitz album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 2000. It proved to be his most successful album, reaching #2 on the Billboard 200  and selling nearly 11 million copies worldwide and ultimately becoming one of the most commercially successful albums of the decade. The single "[[Again (Lenny Kravitz song)|Again]]" earned him his third consecutive Grammy for the Best Male Rock Vocal in the [[Grammy Awards of 2001]]. Kravitz also co-wrote the song "God Gave Me Everything" with [[Mick Jagger]] in this period, appearing on Jagger's 2001 solo album ''[[Goddess in the Doorway]]'' and in the film ''[[Being Mick]]''.

===2001-2005: ''Lenny'' and ''Baptism''===

Kravitz released his sixth album ''[[Lenny (album)|Lenny]]'' in October 2001. The album was recorded in [[Miami]]. Kravitz wrote the song "Bank Robber Man" after the [[Miami]] Police Department detained and cuffed him while walking to the gym with his trainer because police stated that he matched the description of a bank robber. Lenny did not have any identification with him at the time and the police on the scene did not believe that he was indeed Lenny Kravitz. The bank teller who was robbed was then brought to the scene and said Lenny was not the bank robber. [[Miami]] Police later sent officers to Lenny's home to apologize for the detention. When asked if he thought the incident was a case of [[racial profiling]], Kravitz said he wasn<U+2019>t sure. The first single from the album, "[[Dig In]]", went to number 1 in Argentina and the top 10 in Italy and Portugal. The video for "Dig In" was originally supposed to be shot at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] on September 12, 2001 but the terrorist attacks on the [[World Trade Center]] on September 11, 2001 caused the location to be moved. The video was later shot off the coast [[Miami]]. He won his fourth Grammy in [[Grammy Awards of 2002|2002]]. "Stillness of Heart", "Believe in Me", and "If I Could Fall In Love" were subsequent singles from the album.

Kravitz was the subject of a photo book by former chief photographer for Rolling stone, [[Mark Seliger]]. Published in November 2001, Seliger captures Kravitz on tour, with family, with friends and in posed portraits.

[[Jay-Z]] invited Kravitz to appear on the track "Guns and Roses" on his 2002 ''[[The Blueprint<U+00B2>: The Gift & the Curse]]''. Kravitz would also join [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[Pharrell]] and [[Loon (rapper)|Loon]] on the track "Show Me Your Soul" from the ''[[Bad Boys II (soundtrack)|Bad Boys II Soundtrack]]''.

In September 2002, Kravitz appeared alongside other rock stars in the episode "[[How I Spent My Strummer Vacation]]" of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

The track reached #1 on the world internet download charts and [[MP3.com]] download chart. Kravitz also appeared on ''Unity'', the official album of the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympics]].

In late 2004, Kravitz dated superstar actress [[Nicole Kidman]]  and reportedly dedicated his hit song "[[Lady (Lenny Kravitz song)|Lady]]" to her. They split in 2005.

Kravitz's seventh album ''[[Baptism (Lenny Kravitz album)|Baptism]]'' was released in May 2004. The first single was "[[Where Are We Runnin'?]]". The single "California" failed to be commercially successful, but "Storm", featuring [[Jay-Z]], reached the charts. "Calling All Angels" was successful in various countries and a huge hit in Brazil,  however it was "Lady" that became the album's surprise hit, making the US Top 30 and propelling "Baptism" to gold status. Also in 2004, he appeared on [[N.E.R.D]]'s album ''[[Fly or Die]]''. From March 2005, Kravitz toured all over the world with the tour ''Electric Church'', which ended at the [[Brixton Academy]], [[London]] in July 2005. Kravitz served as the opening act for [[Aerosmith]] who are long term friends of Kravitz on their fall 2005 tour. The tour began on October 30 at the [[Mohegan Sun Arena]] in [[Uncasville]], [[Connecticut]]. The night before that tour started, October 29, 2005, Lenny's father TV Producer [[Sy Kravitz]] passed away. During that first show, Lenny broke the news to the stunned crowd and stated it was not a time to be sad but rather a time to celebrate because he is now in Heaven. Lenny then dedicated [[Let Love Rule]] to his father. That tour was so successful that it was extended through February 25, 2006 and ended in [[Anaheim]], [[California]].

Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, a close friend of Lenny's would appear at The Orpheum Theater in Boston. The New York City winner, Tyrone Good was presented a train ticket from Penn Station to travel to Philadelphia and rode with the tour the rest of the way starting in Philadelphia (The Electric Factory), Boston (The Orpheum Theater), and finally New York City (The Hammerstein Ballroom).  The winners were featured in the YRB February Edition alongside Lenny Kravitz in a magazine pull-out.  The photo shoot took place at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia on stage. The winner's pull out was featured in another issue of YRB which had Lil' Wayne on the cover.

On February 11, 2008, Kravitz was admitted to Miami Hospital suffering from severe [[bronchitis]].  He had been suffering from a series of severe respiratory tract infections since mid-January,  and the illness developed into bronchitis.

Kravitz's illness had forced him to postpone [[Canadian]] dates &  his trip to Europe to promote his album ''It Is Time for a Love Revolution''.  On March 19, 2008 he canceled the South American part of his tour due to the same illness.  The decision affected planned concerts in [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. In Argentina Kravitz had a performance in the biggest rock festival there, Quilmes Rock Fest.<ref>[http://www.evenpro.com.co/in.php?mod=ver_noticia&noticia_id=64 Press release from Evempro regarding concerts cancellation in Colombia and South America]</ref> 

On [[July 15]], Lenny was honored in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] with the key to the city in a special toast ceremony for his work with the [[United Nations]] Millenium Campaign to end [[poverty|world poverty]].<ref>[http://www.people.com/.../0,,782685_780785_10,00.html "Cause And Effect"]</ref>

Lenny Kravitz will sing on [[Slash (musician)|Slash]]'s first solo album to be released in Summer 2009.

During the Italian leg of his 53 date Let Love Rule (20)09 European tour, Kravitz has been instructed to cancel some shows due to a bad bout of [[bronchitis]]. Under strict orders from his doctor, the singer has been put to rest so that he could make a quick recovery and return to the stage for the rest of his high energy tour. Shows scheduled for Rome on June 5 and Brescia on June 6 have been postponed to late July.
