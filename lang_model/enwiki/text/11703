'''Tibet''' (older spelling '''Thibet'''; {{bo|t=<U+0F56><U+0F7C><U+0F51><U+0F0B>|w=Bod|l=p<U+02B0><U+00F8><U+0300><U+0294>}}; [[Simplified Chinese|Simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese|Traditional]] [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: <U+897F><U+85CF>, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: X<U+012B>z<U+00E0>ng; also referred to as <U+85CF><U+533A> ([[Simplified Chinese]]), <U+85CF><U+5340> ([[Traditional Chinese]]), Z<U+00E0>ngq<U+016B> ([[Hanyu Pinyin]]), see [[#Name|Name section]] below) is a [[plateau]] region in [[Central Asia]] and the indigenous home to the [[Tibetan people]]. With an average [[elevation]] of 4,900 [[metre]]s (16,000 [[Foot (unit of length)|ft]]), it is the highest region on Earth and is commonly referred to as the "Roof of the World."

Tibet is today administered by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Tibet is also officially claimed by the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan). However in the [[Tibetan sovereignty debate]], the government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Tibet in Exile disagree over when Tibet became a part of China, and whether this incorporation into China is legitimate according to international law.

The Tibetan Empire came into existence in the [[seventh century]] when Emperor [[Songts<U+00E4>n Gampo]] united many areas and tribes of the region.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Since the early 1600s a lineage of [[tulku]]s (reincarnate lamas), known as the [[Dalai Lama]]s have administrated Tibet,{{Fact|date=June 2007}} and the 14 Dalai Lamas are believed to be the emanations of [[Avalokite<U+015B>vara]] ("Chenrezig" [''spyan ras gzigs''] in Tibetan), the [[bodhisattva]] of compassion.

Between the [[17th century]] and 1959, the [[Dalai Lama]] and his associates were the predominant political power administering religious and administrative authority over a large portion of the country from the traditional capital [[Lhasa]], regarded as Tibet's holiest city.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}<!--(interesting material, but it belongs elsewhere in the article. Also, why "Galoon"? It's usually "Kalon", or "Galoin" in Tibetan pinyin) According to a Chinese source,<ref>Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp89-92</ref> between the 17th century to 1721, the political leader of Tibet was the Degsi or governor. In 1721, Chinese emperor abolished the position of Degsi and gave the political power to the hands of four Galoons. In 1751, Chinese emperor established the Dalai Lama as both the spiritual leader and political leader of Tibet who lead a government (Gaxag) with four Galoons in it.-->

==Definitions of Tibet==
[[Image:Flag of Tibet.svg|thumb|left|220px|[[Flag of Tibet]] used intermittently between 1912 and 1950. This version was introduced by the 13th Dalai Lama in 1912. It continues to be used by the [[Government of Tibet in Exile]], but is outlawed in the [[PRC]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}]]


When the [[Central Tibetan Administration|Government of Tibet in Exile]] and the Tibetan refugee community abroad refer to Tibet, they mean the areas consisting of the traditional provinces of [[Amdo]], [[Kham]], and [[<U+00DC>-Tsang]], but excluding areas outside the [[People's Republic of China]]'s administration like the disputed territory [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Sikkim]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Ladakh]] that have also formed part of the Tibetan cultural sphere.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

When the People's Republic of China (PRC) refers to Tibet, it means the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] (TAR): a [[province of China|province]]-level entity which, according to the territorial claims of the PRC, includes [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (presently under the administration of [[India]]; India considers Arunachal Pradesh to be an integral part of its territory). The TAR covers the [[Dalai Lama]]'s former domain, consisting of <U+00DC>-Tsang and western Kham, while Amdo and eastern Kham are part of [[Qinghai]], [[Gansu]], [[Yunnan]], and [[Sichuan]].

The difference in definition is a major source of dispute. The distribution of Amdo and eastern Kham into surrounding provinces was initiated by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] during the 18th century and has been continuously maintained by successive Chinese governments. Tibetan exiles, in turn, consider the maintenance of this arrangement since the 18th century as part of a [[divide and rule|divide-and-rule]] policy.

== Name ==
=== In Tibetan ===
Tibetans call their homeland ''Bod'' (<U+0F56><U+0F7C><U+0F51><U+0F0B>), pronounced ''p<U+00F6>'' in Lhasa dialect. It is first attested in the geography of [[Ptolemy]] as <U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03B9> (batai) (Beckwith, C. U. of Indiana Diss. 1977). Tibetans refer to Tibet as a "[[fatherland]]" ({{bo|t=<U+0F55><U+0F0B><U+0F61><U+0F74><U+0F63><U+0F0B>|w=pha-yul}}), whereas "[[motherland]]" ({{bo|t=<U+0F58><U+0F0B><U+0F61><U+0F74><U+0F63><U+0F0B>|w=ma-yul}}) is a [[neologism]] introduced in the [[1960s]] to refer to [[China]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

=== In Chinese ===
[[Image:Himalayas-Lhasa15.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Tibetan plateau]]


The modern Chinese name for Tibet, <U+897F><U+85CF> (X<U+012B>z<U+00E0>ng), is a phonetic transliteration derived from the region called [[Tsang]] (western [[<U+00DC>-Tsang]]). The name originated during the [[Qing Dynasty]] of China, ca. 1700. It can be broken down into "xi" <U+897F> (literally "west"), and "zang" <U+85CF> (literally "Buddhist scripture" or "storage").{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The pre-1700s historic Chinese term for Tibet was <U+5410><U+8543>, pronounced as T<U+01D4>b<U+014D> in [[mainland China]] and T<U+01D4>f<U+0101>n on [[Taiwan]]<ref>"<U+73B0><U+4EE3><U+6C49><U+8BED><U+8BCD><U+5178>","<U+9060><U+6771><U+6F22><U+82F1><U+5927><U+8FAD><U+5178>", its pronunciation is T<U+01D4>f<U+0101>n if not taking historical accuracy into consideration, there is also some debate in mainland china and on Taiwan as to its correct pronunciation.</ref>, its reconstructed Medieval Chinese pronunciation is /t'obw<U+01DD>n/, which comes from the Turkish word for "heights" and is also the origin of the English term "Tibet."

The government of the [[People's Republic of China]] equates Tibet with the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] (TAR). As such, the name "Xizang" is equated with the TAR. In order to refer non-TAR Tibetan areas, or to all of cultural Tibet, the term <U+85CF><U+533A> Z<U+00E0>ngq<U+016B> (literally, "ethnic Tibetan areas") is used. However, Chinese-language versions of pro-Tibetan independence websites, such as the [http://www.freetibet.org Free Tibet Campaign], the [http://www.vot.org/ Voice of Tibet], and [http://www.tibet.net/ Tibet Net] use <U+897F><U+85CF> ("Xizang"), not <U+85CF><U+533A> ("Zangqu"), to mean historic Tibet.

Some English-speakers reserve "Xizang", the Chinese word transliterated into English, for the TAR, to keep the concept distinct from that of historic Tibet. Some pro-independence advocates duplicate the situation into the Chinese language, and use <U+571F><U+756A> (Tubo) or <U+56FE><U+4F2F><U+7279> (Tubote), which are both phonetic transcriptions of the word "Tibet", to refer to historic Tibet.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The character <U+85CF> (z<U+00E0>ng) has been used in transcriptions referring to Tsang as early as the [[Yuan Dynasty]], if not earlier, though the modern term "Xizang" (western Tsang) was devised in the [[18th century]]. The Chinese character <U+85CF> (Z<U+00E0>ng) has also been generalized to refer to all of Tibet, including other concepts related to Tibet such as the [[Tibetan language]] (<U+85CF><U+6587>, Z<U+00E0>ngw<U+00E9>n) and the Tibetan people (<U+85CF><U+65CF>, Z<U+00E0>ngz<U+00FA>).

===In English===
The English word ''Tibet'', like the word for Tibet in most European languages, is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Tubbat''.<ref name="Partridge">Partridge, Eric, ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English'', New York, 1966, p. 719.</ref> This word is derived via [[Persian language|Persian]] from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''T<U+00F6>b<U+00E4>d'' (plural of ''T<U+00F6>b<U+00E4>n''), meaning "the heights".<ref name="Behr">Behr, W., [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0078-6527(1994)34%3C557%3ATCTL%3E2.0.CO%3B2-9 "Stephan V. Beyer, ''The Classical Tibetan Language''"] (book review), ''Oriens'' 34 (1994): 557&ndash;564.</ref> The word for Tibet in Medieval Chinese, <U+5410><U+8543> (Pinyin ''T<U+01D4>f<U+0101>n'', often given as ''Tubo''), is derived from the same Turkic word.<ref name="Behr"/> ''T<U+01D4>f<U+0101>n'' was pronounced /t'o-bw<U+01DD>n/ in Medieval times.[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/query.cgi?basename=\data\china\bigchina&root=config&morpho=0] PRC scholars favor the theory that "Tibet" is derived from ''T<U+01D4>f<U+0101>n''.<ref name="Partridge"/><ref>China Tibet Information Center [http://www.tibet.cn/english/services/forum/for_002.htm "The Origin of the Name of Tibet"]</ref>

==Language==
The [[Tibetan language]] is generally classified as a [[Tibeto-Burman]] language of the [[Sino-Tibetan]] language family. Spoken Tibetan includes numerous regional dialects which, in many cases, are not mutually intelligible. Moreover, the boundaries between ''Tibetan'' and certain other Himalayan languages are sometimes unclear. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), [[Kham]], [[Amdo]], and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects, while other forms, particularly [[Dzongkha]], [[Sikkimese language|Sikkimese]], [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]], and [[Ladakhi language|Ladakhi]], are considered for political reasons by their speakers to be separate languages.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Ultimately, taking into consideration this wider understanding of Tibetan dialects and forms, "greater Tibetan" is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have moved from modern-day Tibet to [[India]] and other countries.

[[Image:World 820.png|thumb|right|350px|The Tibetan Empire (shown in gold) in 820 in relation to the other powers]]

===Pre history===
Chinese and "proto-Tibeto-Burman" may have split sometime before 4000 BC, when the Chinese began growing millet in the Yellow River valley while the Tibeto-Burmans remained nomads. Tibetan split from Burman around AD 500.<ref name="VanDriem">Van Driem, George "Tibeto-Burman Phylogeny and Prehistory: Languages, Material Culture and Genes".</ref><ref name="Bellwood">Bellwood, Peter & Renfrew, Colin (eds) ''Examining the farming/language dispersal hypothesis'' (2003), Ch 19.</ref>

Prehistoric [[Iron Age]] [[hill forts]] and burial complexes have recently been found on the [[Chang Tang]] plateau but the remoteness of the location is hampering archaeological research. The initial identification of this culture is as the [[Zhang Zhung culture]] which is described in ancient Tibetan texts and is known as the original culture of the [[B<U+00F6>n]] religion.

===The Tibetan Empire===
[[Image:SongstenGampoandwives.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Songtsen Gampo|King Songtsen Gampo]] (centre) with his wives]].

A series of [[List of Kings of Tibet|kings]] ruled Tibet from the 7th to the 11th century. At times Tibetan rule extended as far south as [[Bengal]] and as far north as [[Mongolia]].

Tibet first enters history in the ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geography of Ptolemy]]'' under the name ''batai'' (<U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03B9>), a Greek transcription of the indigenous name ''Bod''. Tibet next appears in history in a Chinese text where it is referred to as ''fa''. The first incident from recorded Tibetan history which is confirmed externally occurred when King [[Namri Lontsen]] sent an ambassador to China in the early 7th century.<ref name="Beckwith1977">Beckwith, ''C. Uni. of Indiana Diss.'', 1977</ref>

However general, the history of Tibet begins with the reign of [[Songts<U+00E4>n Gampo]] (604<U+2013>650 CE) who united parts of the Yarlung River Valley and ruled Tibet as a kingdom. In [[640]] he married [[Princess Wencheng]], the niece of the powerful Chinese emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang China]].

Tibet continued as a Central Asian empire until the late 9th century.

===Mongols & Manchus===
[[Image:Kublai Khan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kublai Khan]]]]
In 1240, the Mongols marched into central Tibet and attacked several monasteries. K<U+00F6>den, younger brother of Mongol ruler G<U+00FC>y<U+00FC>k Khan, participated in a ceremony recognizing the [[Sa-skya]] lama as temporal ruler of Tibet in 1247. The Mongol khans had ruled northern China since 1215. They were the emperors of the Yuan Dynasty. [[Kublai Khan]] was a patron of Tibetan Buddhism and appointed the Sa-skya Lama his "Imperial preceptor," or chief religious official. Tibetans viewed this relationship as an example of ''yon-mchod'', or priest-patron relationship. In practice, the Sa-skya lama was subordinate to the Mongol khan. The collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 led to the overthrow of the Sa-skya in Tibet. Tibet was then ruled by a succession of three secular dynasties. According to a Chinese source, in 1372, an emperor of China<U+2019>s Ming Dynasty granted the desi (''sde-srid'', viceroy) of Tibet the official title of Abhiseca State Tutor, and gave him the jade seal of authority. The following year saw this ruler (Jamyang Sagya Gyaincain) send people to pay tribute to the Ming court.<ref>Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp71-79</ref>

===The Dalai Lama lineage===
{{main|Dalai Lama}}
According to the same Chinese source,<ref>Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp71-79</ref> in 1578, Althan Khan, who was subordinate to China<U+2019>s Ming dynasty from 1571, invited Soinam Gyaco to lecture on Buddhism in Qinghai and bestowed upon him the title of "Dalai Lama," thus beginning the official use of the title "Dalai Lama." The 3rd Dalai paid tribute to the Ming imperial court through Althan Khan and wrote to Chinese prime minister, requesting to be allowed to pay tribute to the imperial court on a regular basis, and was approved. In the 16th century, [[Altan Khan]] of Tumet Mongolian tribe supported the [[Dalai Lama]]'s religious lineage to be the dominant religion among Mongols and Tibetans.
[[Image:Lha-bzang Khan Mural Sera Great Assemby Hall.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Lha-bzang Khan]]]]
According to a Chinese source, the sixth Dalai Lama enjoyed a lifestyle that included drinking, the company of women, and writing love songs.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Declaring him to be unworthy as a monk, Mongol leader [[Lha-bzang Khan]] invaded Tibet with the approval of China's [[Kangxi]] emperor in 1705. According to this claim, the Kangxi emperor dismissed him (the sixth Dalai Lama) from office and ordered him brought to Beijing for questioning. He died soon afterwards on the way to Beijing in [[1706]].<ref>Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp89-92</ref> According to this same Chinese source, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Emperor put Amdo under Qing government's direct rule in 1724, and incorporated east Kham into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.<ref>Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp93-96</ref> Beginning in the early 18th century, the Qing government sent a resident commissioner (''[[amban]]'') to Lhasa. Tibetan factions rebelled in 1750 and killed the ''ambasa''. Then, a Qing army entered and defeated the rebels and installed an administration headed by the Dalai Lama. The number of soldiers in Tibet was kept at about 2000. The defensive duties were partly helped out by a local force which was reorganized by the resident commissioner, and the Tibetan government continued to manage day-to-day affairs as before.

===British influence===
Main article: ''[[British expedition to Tibet]]''

{{wikisourcepar|Littell's Living Age/Volume 137/Issue 1775/Tibet|"Tibet" (1878) is an account of early British attempts to gain influence in Tibet.}}[[Image:FrancisYounghusband.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Francis Younghusband]]]]
The first Europeans to arrive in Tibet were [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] missionaries in 1624 and were welcomed by the Tibetans who allowed them to build a [[church]]. The [[18th century]] brought more [[Jesuits]] and [[Capuchins]] from Europe who gradually met opposition from Tibetan [[lama]]s who finally expelled them from Tibet in 1745. However, at the time not all Europeans were banned from the county <U+2013> in 1774 a Scottish nobleman [[George Bogle]] came to [[Shigatse]] to investigate [[trade]] for the [[British East India Company]], introducing the first [[potato]] crop into Tibet.

However by the [[19th century]] the situation of foreigners in Tibet grew more ominous. The [[British Empire]] was encroaching from northern [[India]] into the [[Himilayas]] and [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Russian Empire]] of the [[tsar]]s was expanding south into [[Central Asia]] and each power became suspicious of intent in Tibet. By the [[1850s]] Tibet had banned all foreigners from Tibet and shut its borders to all outsiders except the Chinese.

In [[1865]] [[Great Britain]] began secretly mapping Tibet. Trained Indian surveyor-spies disguised as [[pilgrim]]s or traders counted their strides on their travels across Tibet and took readings at night. [[Nain Singh]], the most famous measured the [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] and [[altitude]] of [[Lhasa]] and traced the [[Yarlung Tsangpo]] river.

Then in 1904 a [[British Empire|British]] diplomatic mission, accompanied by a large military escort, forced its way through to Lhasa. The head of the diplomatic mission was Colonel [[Francis Younghusband]]. The principal motivation for the British mission was a fear, which proved to be unfounded, that [[Russia]] was extending its footprint into Tibet and possibly even giving military aid to the Tibetan government. But on his way to Lhasa, Younghusband killed 1,300 Tibetans in [[Gyangz<U+00EA>]] (as written in "The Great Game" of Peter Hopkirk), because the natives were in fear of what kind of unequal treaty the British would offer the Tibetans. Some documents claim that 5,000 Tibetans were killed by British army.[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-02-25/123412365403.shtml]
[[Image:MG 5813.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Sera Monastery]]]]
When the mission reached Lhasa, the Dalai Lama had already fled to [[Urga]] in [[Mongolia]], but a treaty was signed by lay and ecclesiastical officials of the Tibetan government, and by representatives of the three monasteries of [[Sera monastery|Sera]], [[Drepung]], and [[Ganden]].<ref>Bell, 1924 p. 284; Allen, 2004, p. 282</ref> The treaty made provisions for the frontier between Sikkim and Tibet to be respected, for freer trade between British and Tibetan subjects, and for an indemnity to be paid from the Tibetan Government to the British Government for its expenses in dispatching armed troops to Lhasa. It also made provision for a British trade agent to reside at the trade mart at Gyangz<U+00EA>. The provisions of this 1904 treaty were confirmed in a 1906 treaty signed between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and China, in which the British also agreed "not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet.".<ref>Bell, 1924, p. 288</ref> The position of British Trade Agent at Gyangz<U+00EA> was occupied from 1904 until 1944. It was not until 1937, with the creation of the position of "Head of British Mission Lhasa", that a British officer had a permanent posting in Lhasa itself.<ref>McKay, 1997, pp. 230-1.</ref>
A [[Foreign relations of Nepal|Nepalese]] agency had also been established in Lhasa after the invasion of Tibet by the Gurkha government of [[Nepal]] in [[1855]].<ref>Bell, 1924, pp. 46-7, 278-80</ref>

In the [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Anglo-Chinese Convention] of 1906 which confirmed the Anglo-Tibetan Treaty of 1904, Britain agreed "not to annex Tibetan territory or to interfere in the administration of Tibet" while China engaged "not to ''permit'' any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet".<ref name="treaty1906">[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties11.html Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet (1906)]</ref> In the [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties12.html Anglo-Russian Convention] of 1907, Britain also recognized the "[[suzerainty]] of China over Thibet" and, in conformity with such admitted principle, engaged "not to enter into negotiations with Tibet except through the intermediary of the Chinese Government."<ref name="treaty1907">[http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties12.html Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907)]</ref> The [[Qing]] central government established direct rule over Tibet for the first time in 1910.

The 13th Dalai Lama fled to [[British India]] in February 1910. The same month, the Chinese Qing government issued a proclamation deposing the Dalai Lama and instigating the search for a new incarnation.<ref>Smith (1996), p. 175</ref> While in India, the Dalai Lama became a close friend of the British Political Officer [[Charles Bell]].

The official position of the British Government was it would not intervene between China and Tibet and would only recognize the ''de facto'' government of China within Tibet at this time.<ref>Bell (1924), p. 113</ref> Bell, in his history of Tibet, wrote of this time that "the Tibetans were abandoned to Chinese aggression, an aggression for which the British Military Expedition to Lhasa and subsequent retreat [and consequent power vacuum within Tibet) were primarily responsible".<ref>Bell (1924), p. 113</ref>

[[Image:DalaiLama-13 lg.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[13th Dalai Lama]]]]
The Dalai Lama returned to Tibet from India in July 1912. By the end of 1912, the Chinese troops in Tibet had returned, via India, to [[China Proper]].<ref name="smith"/>

In 1913, Tibet and [[Mongolia]] signed a [[Treaty between Tibet and Mongolia (1913)|treaty]] proclaiming mutual recognition and their independence from China. However, the validity of such a treaty is disputed by historians and diplomats.<ref>The Tibetan representative who signed this document is said to have been a pro-Russian [[Buryat people|Buryat]] monk named [[Agvan Dorjiev]]. There exist some doubts as to the existence/validity of this treaty, the 13th Dalai Lama himself denied that he authorized Dorijiev to negotiate a treaty with Mongolia and, besides, neither the cleric or the Tibetan government ever ratified the treaty. ''see'' Bell, Charles, ''Tibet Past and Present'', 1924, pp150-151. In January 1913, the Russian Foreign Minister, reported the signing of this treaty to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, saying the treaty, in his opinion, was not valid; it was ''nul et non avenu''. The Russian government maintained that, as a Russian subject, Dorjiev could not possibly act in a diplomatic capacity on behalf of the Dalai Lama, a peculiar argument, to say the least. UK Foreign Office Archive: FO 371/1608; </ref> In 1914, representatives of China, Tibet and Britain negotiated a treaty in India: the [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html Simla Convention].

During the convention, the British tried to divide Tibet into Inner and Outer Tibet. When negotiations broke down over the specific boundary between Inner and Outer, the British demanded instead to advance their line of control, enabling them to annex 90,000 square kilometers of traditional Tibetan territory in southern Tibet, which corresponds to most of the modern Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], while recognizing Chinese [[suzerainty]] over Tibet<ref>Article 2 of the [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html Simla Convention]</ref>. Tibetan representatives secretly signed under British pressure; however, the representative of China's central government declared that the secretive annexation of territory was not acceptable. The boundary established in the convention, the [[McMahon Line]], was considered by the British and later the independent Indian government to be the boundary; however, the Chinese view since then has been that since China, which was sovereign over Tibet, did not sign the treaty, the treaty was meaningless, and the annexation and control of southern Tibet Arunachal Pradesh by India is illegal. This paved the way to the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 and the boundary dispute between China and India today.

The subsequent outbreak of [[World War I]] and [[Chinese Civil War]] caused the Western powers and the infighting factions of China proper to lose interest in Tibet, and the 13th Dalai Lama ruled undisturbed until his death in 1933. At that time, the government of Tibet controlled all of [[<U+00DC>-Tsang|<U+00DC>-Tsang (Dbus-gtsang)]] and western [[Kham|Kham (Khams)]], roughly coincident with the borders of [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] today. Eastern Kham, separated by the [[Yangtze River]] was under the control of Chinese warlord [[Liu Wenhui]]. The situation in Amdo ([[Qinghai]]) was more complicated, with the [[Xining]] area controlled by ethnic [[Hui people|Hui]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]], who constantly strove to exert control over the rest of Amdo (Qinghai).

In 1935 the 14th Dalai Lama, [[Tenzin Gyatso]] was born in Amdo in eastern Tibet and was recognized as the latest reincarnation. He was taken to [[Lhasa]] in 1937 where he was later given an official ceremony in 1939. During the [[1940s]] during [[World War II]], two [[Austria|Austrian]] mountaineers, [[Heinrich Harrer]] and [[Peter Aufschnaider]] came to Lhasa, where Harrer became tutor and consort to the young Dalai Lama giving him a sound knowledge of western culture and modern society, until he was forced to leave with the Chinese invasion in 1950.

In 1950, the [[People's Liberation Army]] invaded the Tibetan area of [[Chamdo]], crushing minimal resistance from the ill-equipped Tibetan army. In 1951, the Tibetan representatives, under PLA military pressure, signed a [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet|seventeen-point agreement]] with the PRC's [[Central People's Government]] affirming China's sovereignty over Tibet. The agreement was ratified in Lhasa a few months later.<ref>Gyatso, Tenzin, Dalai Lama XIV, interview, 25 July 1981.</ref><ref> Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951'', University of California Press, 1989, pp812-813 </ref>

However, Eastern [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] were outside the administration of the government of Tibet, and were thus treated like any other Chinese province with land redistribution implemented in full. As a result, a rebellion broke out in [[Amdo]] and eastern [[Kham]] in June 1956. The insurrection, supported by the [[USA|US-American]] [[CIA]], eventually spread to Lhasa. It was crushed by 1959. During this campaign, tens of thousands of Tibetans were killed.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The 14th Dalai Lama and other government principals fled to exile in India, but isolated [[Tibetan resistance movement|resistance]] continued in Tibet until 1969 when the [[CIA]] abruptly withdrew its support.

Although the [[Panchen Lama]] remained a virtual prisoner, the Chinese set him as a figurehead in Lhasa, claiming that he headed the legitimate Government of Tibet since the Dalai Lama had fled to India after the failed Tibetan uprising in 1959, and they established him as the traditional head of the Tibetan government.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} In 1965, the area that had been under the control of the Dalai Lama's government from the [[1910s]] to [[1959]] (U-Tsang and western Kham) was set up as an [[Autonomous region|Autonomous Region]].

In 1989, the Panchen Lama was finally allowed to return to Shigatse, where he addressed a crowd of 30,000 and described what he saw as the suffering of Tibet under the rule of the PRC in terms reminiscent of the petition he had presented to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1962.<ref>The petition of 10th Panchen Lama in 1962</ref> and the harm being done to his country in the name of socialist reform.

[[Image:GedhunCN.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] 11th Panchen Lama]]
In 1995 the Dalai Lama named 6 year old [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] as the 11th Panchen Lama but without official confirmation, while the PRC named another child, [[Gyancain Norbu]] in conflict. Gyancain Norbu was raised in Beijing and has appeared occasionally on state media. The PRC-selected Panchen Lama is rejected by Tibetan exile groups{{Fact|date=February 2007}} who commonly refer to him as the "Panchen Zuma" (literally "fake Panchen Lama").

Since 1979, there have been major [[Chinese economic reform|economic changes]], just as the rest of the PRC, but the political system remains undemocratic and repressive against the independence activists.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Some PRC policies in Tibet have been described as moderate, while others are judged to be more oppressive towards independence activists.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Most religious freedoms have been officially restored, provided the lamas do not challenge the PRC rule.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} Foreigners can visit most parts of Tibet.

The PRC continues to portray its rule over Tibet as an unalloyed improvement, and foreign governments continue to make occasional protests about aspects of PRC rule in Tibet because of frequent reports of human rights violation in Tibet by human rights group such as [[Human Rights Watch]]. All governments, however, recognize the PRC's sovereignty over Tibet, and none have recognized the [[Government of Tibet in Exile]] in India.

According to Patrick French, the estimate of 1.2 million in Tibet is not reliable because Tibetans were not able to process the data well enough to produce a credible total. There were, however, many casualties, with a figure of 400,000 extrapolated from a calculation Warren W.

The government of Tibet in Exile also says that, fundamentally, the issue is that of the right to self-determination of the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama has stated his willingness to negotiate with China for genuine autonomy, although he still refutes China's claims that Tibet was not once an independent country. Some exile Tibetans however, still call for full Tibetan independence. The Dalai Lama sees the millions of Han immigrants, attracted to the TAR by economic incentives and preferential socioeconomic policies, as presenting an urgent threat to the Tibetan nation by diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Tibetan exile groups say that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan way of life is now irrevocably changed. Supporters of the Dalai Lama argue that comparisons between the theocracy before 1950 and the Tibet of today are false because, if China had not invaded, the Tibetan Government and the Dalai Lama would have worked to improve the material lot of the people and their political rights.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

It is reported that when [[Hu Yaobang]], the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, visited Lhasa in 1980 he was unhappy when he found out the region was lagging behind neighbouring provinces. Policies were changed, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has claimed to have granted most religious freedoms. However, monks and nuns are still imprisoned,<ref>Amnesty International, [http://www.drapchi14.org/drapchi14/ 'Who are the Drapchi 14?']</ref> and many Tibetans continue to flee Tibet. At the same time, many Tibetan exiles view projects that the PRC claims to have benefited Tibet, such as the [[China Western Development]] economic plan or the [[Qinghai-Tibet Railway]], are actually politically-motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han migration while benefit only a few Tibetans. Tibetan exiles also view the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being primarily aimed at purely attracting foreign tourists. They also claim that Tibet is still lagging behind the rest of the PRC. Citing for example, that the first large hospital in Tibet was not built until 1985, that several of Lhasa's main roads were not paved until 1987 and that the first students at Tibet University did not graduate until 1988.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} They also claim that there is still preferential treatment awarded to the Han Chinese population of the TAR in the labour market as opposed to Tibetans.{{Fact|June 2007}}

====Evaluation by the People's Republic of China====

The government of the PRC maintains that the Tibetan Government did almost nothing to improve the Tibetans' material and political standard of life during its rule from 1913-1959, and that they opposed any reforms proposed by the Chinese government.<ref>Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp194-197</ref> According to the Chinese government's claim, this is the reason for the tension that grew between some Chinese officials and the Tibetan government in 1959.<ref>Jiawei, Wang, "The Historical Status of China's Tibet", 2000, pp194-197</ref> The government of the PRC maintains that the population of Tibet in 1737 was about 8 million{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and that due to the backward rule of the local theocracy, there was a rapid decrease during the following two centuries eventually resulting in a population of only about 1.19 million in [[1959]]{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Today, the population of Greater Tibet is 7.3 million, of which, according to the 2000 census, six million are ethnic Tibetans.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The government of the PRC views this population growth as the result of the abolition of the theocracy and the introduction of a modern, higher standard of living. Based on the census numbers, the PRC also rejects claims that the Tibetans are being swamped by Han Chinese. Instead the PRC claims that the border for Greater Tibet drawn by the government of Tibet in Exile is so large that it incorporates regions such as [[Xining]] that were never traditionally Tibetan, hence exaggerating the number of non-Tibetans.{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The government of the PRC also rejects claims that the lives of Tibetans have deteriorated, and claims that the lives of Tibetans have been improved immensely compared to self rule before 1950.<ref>Peter Hessler, [http://www.csd99.k12.il.us/khector/tibet_analysis.htm 'Tibet Through Chinese Eyes'], ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb. 1999</ref> Benefits that are commonly quoted include <U+2013> the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] of the (TAR) today is thirty times that of before 1950, workers in Tibet have the second highest wages in China,<ref>[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/55/783.html 'High wages in Tibet benefit the privliviged'], Asian Labour News, 21 February 2005, </ref> the TAR has 22,500 km of highways, as opposed to none in 1950, all secular education in the TAR was created after the revolution, the TAR now has 25 scientific research institutes as opposed to none in 1950, [[infant mortality]] has dropped from 43% in 1950 to 0.661% in 2000, [[life expectancy]] has risen from 35.5 years in 1950 to 67 in 2000, the collection and publishing of the traditional ''[[Epic of King Gesar]]'', which is the longest [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] in the world and had only been handed down orally before, allocation of 300 million [[Renminbi]] since the 1980s for the maintenance and protection of Tibetan monasteries.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/e-white/20011108/3.htm 'Tibet's March Toward Modernization, section II The Rapid Social Development in Tibet'], Information Office of the State Council of the PRC, November 2001</ref> The [[Cultural Revolution]] and the cultural damage it wrought upon the entire PRC is generally condemned as a nationwide catastrophe, whose main instigators, in the PRC's view, the [[Gang of Four]], have been brought to justice. And whose reoccurrence is unthinkable in an increasingly modernized China. The [[China Western Development]] plan is viewed by the PRC as a massive, benevolent, and patriotic undertaking by the wealthier eastern coast to help the western parts of China, including Tibet, catch up in prosperity and living standards.

{{main|Geography of Tibet}}

Tibet is located on the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the world's highest region. Most of the [[Himalaya]] mountain range, one of the youngest mountain ranges in the world at only 4 million years old, lies within Tibet. Its most famous peak, [[Mount Everest]], is on [[Nepal]]'s border with Tibet. The average altitude is about 3,000 m in the south and 4,500 m in the north.

The atmosphere is severely dry nine months of the year, and average snowfall is only 18 inches, due to the [[rain shadow]] effect whereby mountain ranges prevent moisture from the ocean from reaching the plateaus. Western passes receive small amounts of fresh snow each year but remain traversable all year round. Low temperatures are prevalent throughout these western regions, where bleak desolation is unrelieved by any vegetation beyond the size of low bushes, and where wind sweeps unchecked across vast expanses of arid plain. The Indian [[monsoon]] exerts some influence on eastern Tibet. Northern Tibet is subject to high temperatures in the summer and intense cold in the winter.
[[Image:TibetanMountains13.jpg|left|250px]]

Historic Tibet consists of several regions:

* Amdo (''A mdo'') in the northeast, incorporated by China into the provinces of [[Qinghai]], [[Gansu]] and [[Sichuan]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

* Kham (''Khams'') in the east, divided between Sichuan, northern [[Yunnan]] and Qinghai.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}
** Western Kham, part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region

* U (''dBus''), in the center, and Tsang (''gTsang'') in the center-west, part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region

* Ngari (''mNga' ris'') in the far west, part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region

Tibetan cultural influences extend to the neighboring states of [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], adjacent regions of India such as [[Sikkim]] and [[Ladakh]], and adjacent provinces of China where [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is the predominant religion.

On the border with India, the region popularly known among Chinese as [[South Tibet]]{{Fact|date=June 2007}} is claimed by China and administered by [[India]] as the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

Several major rivers have their source in the Tibetan Plateau (mostly in present-day Qinghai Province), including:
* [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]
* [[Yellow River]]
* [[Indus River]]
* [[Mekong]]
* [[Brahmaputra River]] <U+2013> the main river that flows through Tibet. In Tibetan, referred to as the Yarlung Tsangpo
* [[Ganges]]
* [[Salween River|Salween]]
The Indus, Brahmaputra rivers originate from a lake (Tib: Tso Mapham) in Western Tibet, near Mt. Kailash. The mountain is a holy pilgrimage for both Hindus and Tibetans. The Hindus consider the mountain to be the abode of Lord Shiva. The Tibetan name for Mt Kailash is Khang Rinpoche.

They believe that the large influx of Han Chinese will ultimately extinguish the local culture.<ref>{{cite news|title=Deemed a road to ruin, Tibetans say Beijing rail-way poses latest threat to minority culture|url=http://www.tibetanliberation.org/railroad802.html|date=[[2002-08-26]]|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref>
Other opponents argue that the railway will damage Tibet's fragile ecology and that most of its economic benefits will go to migrant Han Chinese.<ref>{{cite news|title=China Opens 1st Train Service to Tibet|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/30/AR2006063000449.html|date=[[2006-06-30]]|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2006-07-04}}</ref> As activists call for a boycott of the railway, the Dalai Lama has urged Tibetans to "wait and see" what benefits the new line might bring to them.

[[Image:TAR-TAP-TAC.png|250px|thumb|Ethnic Tibetan autonomous entities set up by the People's Republic of China. Opponents to the PRC dispute the actual level of autonomy.]] [[Image:Litang-ninos-c01-f.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tibetan]] children in [[Lithang]]]][[Image:Cubical houses in Xiangcheng valley.JPG|thumb|250px|Traditional Kham houses]]
Historically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]]. Other ethnic groups in Tibet include [[Monpa|Menba (Monpa)]], [[Lhoba]], [[Mongols]] and [[Hui Chinese]]. According to tradition the original ancestors of the Tibetan people, as represented by the six red bands in the Tibetan flag, are: the Se, Mu, Dong, Tong, Dru and Ra.

The issue of the proportion of the [[Han Chinese]] population in Tibet is a politically sensitive one. The Tibetan Government-in-Exile says that the People's Republic of China has actively swamped Tibet with Han Chinese migrants in order to alter Tibet's demographic makeup, while the People's Republic of China has denied this.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The death toll in Tibet since the invasion of the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] in 1950 has been estimated at a median of 600,000.<ref>[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Tibet Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm]</ref>

=== View of the Tibetan exile community ===

Between the [[1960s]] and [[1980s]], many prisoners (over 1 million, according to [[Harry Wu]]) were sent to [[laogai]] camps in [[Amdo]] ([[Qinghai]]), where they were then employed locally after release. Since the 1980s, increasing economic liberalization and internal mobility has also resulted in the influx of many [[Han Chinese]] into Tibet for work or settlement, though the actual number of this [[floating population]] remains disputed.

The [[Government of Tibet in Exile]] gives the number of non-Tibetans in Greater Tibet as 7.5 million (as opposed to 6 million Tibetans), and claims this is as a result of an active policy of demographically swamping the Tibetan people and further diminishing any chances of Tibetan political independence, and as such, to be in violation of the [[Geneva Convention]] of 1946 that prohibits settlement by occupying powers.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The Government of Tibet in Exile questions all statistics given by the PRC government, since they do not include members of the [[People's Liberation Army]] garrisoned in Tibet, or the large floating population of unregistered migrants.{{Fact|date=June 2007}} The [[Qinghai-Tibet Railway]] ([[Xining]] to [[Lhasa]]) is also a major concern, as it is believed to further facilitate the influx of migrants.

=== View of the People's Republic of China ===
The PRC government does not view itself as an occupying power and has vehemently denied allegations of demographic swamping. The PRC also does not recognize [[Greater Tibet]] as claimed by the government of Tibet in Exile, saying that the idea was engineered by foreign imperialists as a plot to divide China amongst themselves, (Mongolia being a striking precedent, gaining independence with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] backing and subsequently aligning itself with the [[Soviet Union]]) and that those areas outside the TAR were not controlled by the Tibetan government before 1959 in the first place, having been administered instead by other surrounding provinces for centuries.<ref>[http://news.xinhuanet.com/zhengfu/2002-11/15/content_630888.htm Xinhua News report] {{languageicon|zh|Chinese}}</ref>

The PRC gives the number of Tibetans in [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] as 2.4 million, as opposed to 190,000 non-Tibetans, and the number of Tibetans in all Tibetan autonomous entities combined (slightly smaller than the Greater Tibet claimed by exiled Tibetans) as 5.0 million, as opposed to 2.3 million non-Tibetans. In the TAR itself, much of the Han population is to be found in [[Lhasa]]. Population control policies like the [[one-child policy]] only apply to [[Han Chinese]], not to minorities such as Tibetans.

[[Jampa Phuntsok]], chairman of the TAR, has also said that the central government has no policy of migration into Tibet due to its harsh high-altitude conditions, that the 6% Han in the TAR is a very fluid group mainly doing business or working, and that there is no immigration problem.<ref>[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2003-08-27/1644645902s.shtml SINA News report] {{languageicon|zh|Chinese}}</ref>

===Religion===
===Tibetan Buddhism===
{{main|Tibetan Buddhism}}
[[Religion]] is extremely important to the Tibetans; Tibet is the traditional center of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], a distinctive form of [[Vajrayana]], which is also related to the [[Shingon]] Buddhist tradition in Japan. Tibetan Buddhism is practiced not only in Tibet but also in [[Mongolia]], the [[Buryat Republic]], the [[Tuva Republic]], and in the [[Republic of Kalmykia]]. Tibet is also home to the original spiritual tradition called [[B<U+00F6>n]].

===Islam===
{{main|Islam in Tibet}}
In Tibetan cities, there are also small communities of [[Tibetan Muslim|Muslims]], known as Kachee (Kache), who trace their origin to immigrants from three main regions: Kashmir (Kachee Yul in ancient Tibetan), Ladakh and the Central Asian Turkic countries. Islamic influence in Tibet also came from Persia. After 1959 a group of Tibetan Muslims made a case for Indian nationality based on their historic roots to Kashmir and the Indian government declared all Tibetan Muslims Indian citizens later on that year.<ref>Masood Butt, [http://www.tibet.com/Muslim/tibetan-muslim.html 'Muslims of Tibet'], The Office of Tibet, January/February 1994</ref> There is also a well established Chinese Muslim community (gya kachee), which traces its ancestry back to the [[Hui people|Hui]] ethnic group of China. It is said that Muslim migrants from Kashmir and Ladakh first entered Tibet around the [[12th century]]. Marriages and social interaction gradually led to an increase in the population until a sizable community grew up around [[Lhasa]].{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

The [[Potala Palace]], former residence of the [[Dalai Lama]]s, is a [[World Heritage Site]], as is [[Norbulingka]], former summer residence of the Dalai Lama.

During the suppression of pro-independence forces in the 1950s, and during the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the [[1960s]], most historically significant sites in Tibet were vandalized or totally destroyed.

Since 2002, Tibetans in exile have allowed a [[Miss Tibet]] [[beauty contest]] in spite of concerns that this event is considered a Western influence. The beauty contest is condemned by the Tibetan government in exile.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

===Tibetan art===
{{main|Tibetan art}}
[[Image:thanka.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A [[thangka]] painting in [[Sikkim]] ]]
Tibetan representations of art are intrinsically bound with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and commonly depict [[deities]] or variations of [[Buddha]] in various forms from bronze Buddhist statues and shrines, to highly colorful [[thangka]] paintings and [[mandala]]s. 

===Architecture===
[[Image:Sand mandala tibet 1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tibetan sand mandala]]
{{main|Tibetan culture#Architecture}}
Tibetan architecture contains Oriental and [[India]]n influences, and reflects a deeply [[Buddhist]] approach. The [[Buddhist wheel]], along with two dragons, can be seen on nearly every [[Gompa]] in Tibet. The design of the Tibetan [[Ch<U+00F6>rten]]s can vary, from roundish walls in [[Kham]] to squarish, four-sided walls in [[Ladakh]].

The most unusual feature of Tibetan architecture is that many of the houses and monasteries are built on elevated, sunny sites facing the south, and are often made out a mixture of rocks, wood, cement and earth. Little fuel is available for heat or lighting, so flat roofs are built to conserve heat, and multiple windows are constructed to let in sunlight. Walls are usually sloped inwards at 10 degrees as a precaution against frequent earthquakes in the mountainous area.
[[Image:Potala from SW.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Potala Palace]]
Standing at 117 meters in height and 360 meters in width, the [[Potala Palace]] is considered as the most important example of Tibetan architecture. Formerly the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]], it contains over a thousand rooms within thirteen stories, and houses portraits of the past Dalai Lamas and statues of the Buddha. It is divided between the outer White Palace, which serves as the administrative quarters, and the inner Red Quarters, which houses the assembly hall of the Lamas, chapels, 10,000 shrines, and a vast library of Buddhist scriptures.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Tibet}}
[[Image:Ladakhmusic.jpg|right|250px]]
The music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region, centered in Tibet but also known wherever ethnic [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] groups are found in [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and further abroad. First and foremost Tibetan music is [[religious music]], reflecting the profound influence of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] on the culture.

Tibetan music often involves [[chanting]] in [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]] or [[Sanskrit]], as an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of [[sacred text]]s or in celebration of various [[festival]]s. [[Yang]] chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant [[drums]] and low, sustained syllables. Other styles include those unique to the various schools of Tibetan Buddhism, such as the classical music of the popular [[Gelugpa]] school, and the romantic music of the [[Nyingmapa]], [[Sakyapa]] and [[Kagyupa]] schools.

[[Nangma]] dance music is especially popular in the [[karaoke]] bars of the urban center of Tibet, [[Lhasa]]. Another form of popular music is the classical [[gar (music)|gar]] style, which is performed at rituals and ceremonies. [[Lu (music)|Lu]] are a type of songs that feature glottal vibrations and high pitches. There are also epic bards who sing of Tibet's national hero [[Gesar]].

===Festivals===
{{main|Tibetan Festivals}}
[[Image:IMG 1016 Lhasa Barkhor.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Monlam Prayer Festival]]]]
Tibet has various festivals which commonly are performed to worship the Buddha throughout the year. [[Losar]] is the Tibetan New Year Festival and the [[Monlam Prayer Festival]] follows it in the first month of the [[Tibetan calendar]] which involves many Tibetans dancing and participating in sports events and sharing picnics.

==Cuisine==
{{main|Tibetan cuisine}}
[[Image:Monk churning butter tea.JPG|thumb|left|140px|A monk churning [[Butter tea]]]]
The most important crop in Tibet is [[barley]], and dough made from barley flour called [[tsampa]], is the [[staple food]] of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called [[momo (food)|momos]]. [[Meat]] dishes are likely to be [[yak]], [[goat]], or [[mutton]], often dried, or cooked into a spicy [[stew]] with [[potato]]es. [[Mustard seed]] is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak [[yoghurt]], [[butter]] and [[cheese]] are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yoghurt is considered something of a prestige item. [[Butter tea]] is very popular to drink and many Tibetans drink up to 100 cups a day.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Tibet in popular culture==
===Tibet in film===
[[Image:Dreaming Lhasa movie.jpg|thumb|right|160px|''[[Dreaming Lhasa]]'' (2005) is the first officially recognized film from the Tibetan diaspora]]
In recent years there have been a number of films produced about Tibet, mostly notably Hollywood films such as ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'', starring [[Brad Pitt]], and ''[[Kundun]]'', a biography of the [[Dalai Lama]], directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]. Both of these films were banned by the Chinese government because of Tibetan nationalist overtones. Other films include ''[[Samsara (2001 film)|Samsara]]'', ''[[The Cup]]'' and the 1999 ''[[Himalaya]]'', a French-American produced film with a Tibetan cast set in [[Nepal]] and Tibet. In 2005, exile Tibetan filmmaker Tenzing Sonam and his partner Ritu Sarin made ''[[Dreaming Lhasa]]'', the first internationally recognized feature film to come out of the diaspora to explore the contemporary reality of Tibet. In 2006, [[Sherwood Hu]] made ''Prince of the Himalayas'', an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]], set in ancient Tibet and featuring an all-Tibetan cast. Seen also briefly in the 1994 movie ''[[The Shadow]]'', starring [[Alec Baldwin]].
