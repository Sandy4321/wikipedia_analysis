The '''32nd Boat Race''' between crews from the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] took place on the [[River Thames]] on the 20 March 1875. The Cambridge crew contained four [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] to Oxford's two, the latter went into the race without a win since the [[The Boat Race 1869|1869 race]].  In a race umpired by [[Joseph William Chitty]], Oxford won by ten lengths in a time of 22 minutes 2 seconds, taking the overall record in the event to 17&ndash;15 in their favour.  One of the Cambridge crew broke his [[Racing shell#Sliding seats|slide]] during the race.

D. Darbishire who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1868|1868]], 1869 and 1870 races,<ref>Burnell, p. 97</ref> F. H. Hall who had coxed for three races between 1870 and 1872, Robert Wells Risley who had rowed four times between the [[The Boat Race 1857|1857]] and [[The Boat Race 1860|1860 races]], Edmund Warre (represented Oxford in 1857 and 1858), [[Frank Willan (rower)|Frank Willan]] (four-time winning rower between 1866 and 1869) and [[Walter Bradford Woodgate]] who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1862|1862]] and [[The Boat Race 1863|1863]] races.<ref>Burnell, pp. 98&ndash;102</ref> [[Joseph William Chitty]] was the umpire for the race.  He had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 (in [[The Boat Race 1849 (March)|March]] and [[The Boat Race 1849 (December)|December]]) and the [[The Boat Race 1852|1852 race]].  The starter was Edward Searle.<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 97</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 12.375&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (75.3&nbsp;kg), {{convert|1.625|lb|kg|1}} more than their opponents.<ref name=drink69>Drinkwater, p. 69</ref>  Cambridge's crew contained four former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]], including [[Herbert Rhodes|Herbert Edward Rhodes]] who was making his third appearance in the race.  Oxford saw two rowers return from the 1874 race, in H. J. Stayner and J. P. Way.<ref name=burn61/>  According to Drinkwater, the [[Oxford University Boat Club]] towards the end of 1874 produced a "fine crew", and of particular note was the inclusion of the former [[Eton College|Eton]] Captain of the Boats [[Tom Cottingham Edwards-Moss]].  In contrast, Cambridge's crew, with just two returning from the previous year's race, was completed with "material ... not of a very high order".<ref name=drink69/>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]], along which the race is conducted]]
Oxford were considered clear pre-race favourites to win their first Boat Race in five years; conditions were inclement with a "nasty north-west wind" but a "fair tide".<ref name=drink69/>  They lost the [[coin flipping|toss]] and Cambridge elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing Oxford the Surrey side of the river.<ref name=burn61/>  The race commenced at 1:13 p.m., and Cambridge made the better start, taking the lead from the outset with a higher [[stroke rate]].  Half a length ahead after a minute, the Light Blues nearly had a clear water advantage but tired in the strong headwind, and started to be caught by Craven Steps, around {{convert|1000|yd|m}} along the course.<ref name=drink69/> About a mile into the race, one of the Cambridge crew broke a [[Racing shell#Sliding seats|slide]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = A History of The First Trinity Boat Club | url = http://www.firstandthird.org/frames/club/1sttrinhistory.shtml| first = W.

The crews were level at the Crab Tree pub and by [[Hammersmith Bridge]], and with the advantage of the bend in the river, Oxford were clear and went on to win by ten lengths in a time of 22 minutes 2 seconds.  It was their first victory since 1869 and took the overall record in the event to 17&ndash;15 in their favour.<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 8 December 2014}}</ref>
