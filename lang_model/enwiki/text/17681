===Tenure===
Before taking office as Mayor, Booker sued the James administration seeking to terminate cut-rate land deals favoring two redevelopment agencies that had contributed to James' campaigns and listed James as a member of their advisory boards. Booker argued that the state<U+2019>s <U+201C>[[Pay to play#In politics|pay-to-play]]<U+201D> laws had been violated and that the land deals would cost the city more than $15 million in lost revenue. Specifically, Booker referenced a parcel on Broad and South streets that would generate only $87,000 under the proposed land deals yet was valued at $3.7 million under then-current market rates.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/19/nyregion/19newark.htm|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Booker Says Newark Mayor Is 'Giving Away Our Land'|author=Damien Cave|date=April 19, 2006|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> On June 20, 2006 Superior Court Judge Patricia Costello ruled in favor of Booker.<ref>{{cite web|author=Katie Wang|url=http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/essex/index.ssf?/base/news-2/1150866745162770.xml&coll=1|title=Booker wins fight on city land sales|date=June 21, 2006|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}}}</ref>

In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey investigators foiled a plot to assassinate Booker led by [[Bloods]] gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons. The motive for the plot was unclear, but was described variously as a response to the acrimonious campaign<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite web|author=Richard G.

Booker gained national attention when on December 28, 2010, a constituent used [[Twitter]] to ask him to send someone to her father's house to shovel his driveway because her elderly father was going to attempt to do it himself. Booker responded by tweeting; "I will do it myself; where does he live?" Other people volunteered, including one person who offered his help on Twitter, and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the man's driveway.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2039945,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)]]|author=Sean Gregory|title=Cory Booker: The Mayor of Twitter and Blizzard Superhero|date=December 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/01/03/mayor-digs-in-after-twitter-appeal|work=[[CNN]]|title=Mayor digs in after Twitter appeal|date=Jan 3, 2010|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref> On April 12, 2012, Booker saved a woman from a house fire, suffering smoke inhalation and second degree burns on his hands in the process.
