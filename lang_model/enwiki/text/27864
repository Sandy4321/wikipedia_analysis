'''''Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy: A Guide to America's Censorship Wars''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by lawyer and [[civil liberties|civil libertarian]] [[Marjorie Heins]] about [[freedom of speech]] and the [[censorship]] in the early 1990s by the U.S. government of works of art. The book was published in 1993 by [[The New Press]]. Heins provides an overview of the history of censorship, including the 1873 [[Comstock laws]], before moving on to more topical case studies of attempts at suppression of free expression. The book argues that artists have been [[scapegoat]]ed by those advocating censorship, as a method of focusing debate away from suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene has been used as a tactic throughout history to suppress [[women's rights]].

Key incidents of censorship from the time period discussed in the book include: actions by the ratings board of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA), [[Parental Advisory]] warning labels put forth by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), and how this led to [[self-censorship]] by music stores, and attempts by the [[Meese Report|Meese Commission]] to encourage proprietors not to sell ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' and ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazines. The book criticizes controversy generated by politicians against the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], over the organization's support of photography by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and artwork "[[Piss Christ]]" by [[Andres Serrano]]. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of [[pornography]], [[hip hop music]], and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.

''Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy'' received a favorable reception from the ''Women's Review of Books'' which praised the author's clear writing style and ability to present complex legal information in an understandable format for the reader. ''[[The News & Observer]]'' observed the book implored readers to act against censorship while also documenting its history. In its review, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' echoed the author's warnings of the dangers of censorship and admonished readers to take heed to the wisdom imparted in the book. ''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]'' surmised the crux of Heins' argument was that the solution to problematic expression would be simply additional speech to educate and explain. ''[[American Book Review]]'' criticized the author for arguing for an absolute right to free speech in virtually all circumstances.

The book discusses the history of the division of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) that assigns movie ratings, the Classification and Rating Administration. Heins quotes New York Supreme Court Judge Charles Ramos who observed that film directors have since learned to style their movies in such a way as to receive certain ratings from the MPAA.<ref name="patriciaholt" />

Heins recounts how the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) advocated for its associated organizations to add [[Parental Advisory]] warnings on labels of music albums as a way to advise parents about possible offensive content. She describes how the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] co-founded by [[Tipper Gore]] and hearings held by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee which included Senator [[Al Gore]] led to attempts at censorship by lawmakers in eight individual states. Heins laments that this subsequently led to [[self-censorship]] and blacklisting of certain albums by music stores.<ref name="patriciaholt" />

''Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy'' provides the reader with case studies of censorship in the U.S. including a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] against naked erotic dancing, laws against pornography in the 1980s supported by proponents [[Catharine MacKinnon]] and [[Andrea Dworkin]], and attempts by the [[Meese Report|Meese Commission]] to encourage proprietors not to sell ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' and ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazines.<ref name="patriciaholt" /> The Meese Report, formally the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography, was so-called colloquially because the people on the Commission were selected by then-Attorney General of the United States [[Edwin Meese]].<ref name="merzer">{{cite news|page=1A|title=Censorship on rising tide across U.S.A. words and thoughts under greater attack|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|location=Florida|date=September 25, 1986|author1=Martin Merzer|author2=Itabari Njeri}}</ref> Released in 1986, the Meese Report demanded U.S. citizens protest pornography because of its asserted harmful impact to women and children.<ref name="merzer" /> The book criticizes controversy generated by politicians against the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], over the organization's support of photography by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and artwork "[[Piss Christ]]" by [[Andres Serrano]].<ref name="victorgreto" />

''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]]'' observed "Throughout the book, whether discussing attempts to censor rap music or pornography, Heins attempts to communicate the radical differences between the limits of American law and America's seemingly endless social problems.
