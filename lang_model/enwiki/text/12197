The '''2007 National Assembly election''' was held on Thursday 3 May 2007 to elect members to the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. It was the third [[general election]]. On the same day local elections in [[England]] and [[Scotland]], and the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|Scottish Parliament election]] took place. This election was preceded by the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2003|previous Assembly election]] in 2003.

The election saw [[Plaid Cymru]] make gains at the expense of [[Wales Labour Party|Labour]], although Labour remain the largest party in the Assembly, as they have since it began. Plaid have stated they will make a referendum on devolving further powers to the National Assembly a condition for a coalition.<ref>[http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/newspolitics/tm_headline=plaid-to-seek-devolution-referendum-after-election&method=full&objectid=18377596&siteid=50082-name_page.html Plaid to seek devolution referendum after election], Wales, 3 January 2007, accessed on 8 February 2007.</ref> Wales reported that senior civil servants before the election were preparing for three possible coalition administrations: Labour/Liberal Democrat, Labour/Plaid Cymru or Plaid Cymru/Liberal Democrat/Conservative.

==Major parties==
The [[Welsh Labour Party]] before the election had 29 seats, [[Plaid Cymru]] had 12, the [[Welsh Conservative Party]] 11, the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] 6, [[Forward Wales]] 1, with 1 independent ([[Trish Law]]). Mrs Law won her seat at a [[Blaenau Gwent by-elections, 2006|2006 by-election]], the seat having been won by Labour in the 2003 election. The one Forward Wales Assembly Member was elected as an independent before forming the party. Otherwise, the standings represent the 2003 results.

==Electoral method==
In [[general election]]s for the National Assembly for Wales, each voter has two votes in a [[mixed member proportional representation|mixed member system]]. The first vote may be used to vote for a candidate to become the Assembly Member for the voter's constituency, elected by the first past the post system. The second vote may be used to vote for a regional [[closed list|closed party list]] of candidates. Additional member seats are allocated from the lists by the [[d'Hondt method]], with constituency results being taken into account in the allocation. The overall result is approximately [[proportional representation|proportional]].

==National election, 2003==
Due to boundary changes the composition of the outgoing Assembly will not reflect the Assembly that was elected in May 2003 (see [[National Assembly for Wales constituencies and electoral regions]]). The main changes are in the North west of Wales where the constituencies of [[Conwy (Wales Assembly constituency)|Conwy]], [[Caernarfon (Wales Assembly constituency)|Caernarfon]], and [[Meirionydd nant Conwy (Wales Assembly constituency)|Meirionydd nant Conwy]] are replaced by [[Aberconwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Aberconwy]], [[Arfon (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Arfon]] and [[Dwyfor Meirionnydd (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Dwyfor Meirionnydd]].
