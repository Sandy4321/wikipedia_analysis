[[Dom (title)|Dom]] '''Pedro&nbsp;I''' (English: Peter&nbsp;I; 12 October 1798&nbsp;<U+2013> 24 September 1834), nicknamed "the Liberator",{{sfn|Viana|1994|p=252}} was the [[List of monarchs of Brazil|founder and first]] ruler of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. As King Dom '''Pedro&nbsp;IV''', he [[List of Portuguese monarchs#House of Braganza, or Brigantine Dynasty (1640<U+2013>1910)|reigned briefly]] over [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], where he also became known as "the Liberator" as well as "the Soldier King".{{sfn|Saraiva|2001|p=378}} Born in [[Lisbon]], Pedro&nbsp;I was the fourth child of King Dom [[Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI of Portugal|Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI]] of Portugal and Queen [[Carlota Joaquina of Spain|Carlota Joaquina]], and thus a member of the [[House of Braganza]]. When their country was invaded by French troops in 1807, he and his family fled to Portugal's largest and wealthiest colony, Brazil.

The outbreak of the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]] in Lisbon compelled Pedro&nbsp;I's father to return to Portugal in April 1821, leaving him to rule Brazil as regent. He had to deal with threats from revolutionaries and insubordination by Portuguese troops, all of which he subdued. The Portuguese government's threat to revoke the political autonomy that Brazil had enjoyed since 1808 was met with widespread discontent in Brazil. Pedro&nbsp;I chose the Brazilian side and declared [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, he was acclaimed Brazilian emperor and by March 1824 had defeated all armies loyal to Portugal. A few months later, Pedro&nbsp;I crushed the short-lived [[Confederation of the Equator]], a failed secession attempt by provincial rebels in Brazil's [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeast]].

A secessionist rebellion in the southern province of [[Cisplatina]] in early 1825, and the subsequent attempt by the [[United Provinces of South America]] to annex it, led the Empire into the [[Cisplatine War]]. In March 1826, Pedro&nbsp;I briefly became king of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Dona [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria&nbsp;II]]. The situation worsened in 1828 when the war in the south resulted in Brazil's loss of Cisplatina. During the same year in Lisbon, Maria&nbsp;II's throne was usurped by Prince Dom [[Miguel I of Portugal|Miguel]], Pedro&nbsp;I's younger brother. The Emperor's concurrent and scandalous sexual affair with a female courtier tarnished his reputation. Other difficulties arose in the Brazilian parliament, where a struggle over whether the government would be chosen by the monarch or by the legislature dominated political debates from 1826 to 1831. Unable to deal with problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, on 7 April 1831 Pedro&nbsp;I abdicated in favor of his son Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro&nbsp;II]], and sailed for Europe.

Pedro&nbsp;I invaded Portugal at the head of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with what seemed a national civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in a struggle between proponents of [[Liberalism]] and those seeking a return to [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]]. Pedro&nbsp;I died of [[tuberculosis]] on 24 September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by contemporaries and by posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from authoritarian regimes to representative forms of government.

Pedro was born at 08:00{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=36}} on 12 October 1798 in the [[Queluz National Palace|Queluz Royal Palace]] near [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].<ref>See:

</ref> He was named after St. [[Peter of Alcantara]],{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=3}} and his full name was Pedro de Alc<U+00E2>ntara Francisco Ant<U+00F3>nio Jo<U+00E3>o Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim Jos<U+00E9> Gonzaga Pascoal Cipriano Serafim.{{sfn|Branco|1838|p=XXXVI}} He was referred to using the honorific "[[Dom (title)|Dom]]" ([[Lord]]) from birth.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=424}}

Through his father, Prince Dom Jo<U+00E3>o (later King Dom [[Jo<U+00E3>o VI of Portugal|Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI]]), Pedro was a member of the [[House of Braganza]] (Portuguese: ''Bragan<U+00E7>a''){{sfn|Calmon|1950|pp=5, 9}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=10}} and a grandson of King Dom [[Peter III of Portugal|Pedro&nbsp;III]] and Queen Dona (Lady) [[Maria&nbsp;I of Portugal]], who were uncle and niece as well as husband and wife.{{sfn|Calmon|1950|p=11}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=5, 9}} His mother, Do<U+00F1>a [[Carlota Joaquina of Spain|Carlota Joaquina]], was the daughter of King [[Don (honorific)|Don]] [[Charles IV of Spain|Carlos&nbsp;IV]] of Spain.{{sfn|Calmon|1950|p=12}} Pedro's parents had an unhappy marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, who always sought to advance Spain's interests, even to the detriment of Portugal's. Reputedly unfaithful to her husband, she went as far as to plot his overthrow in league with dissatisfied Portuguese nobles.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=4, 8, 10, 28}}{{sfn|Calmon|1950|pp=12<U+2013>13}}

As the second eldest son, Pedro became his father's heir and [[Prince of Beira]] upon the death of his elder brother [[Francisco Ant<U+00F3>nio, Prince of Beira|Francisco Ant<U+00F3>nio]] in 1801.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=6}} Prince Dom Jo<U+00E3>o had been acting as regent on behalf of his mother, Queen Maria&nbsp;I, after she was declared incurably insane in 1792.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=3}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=9}} By 1802, Pedro's parents were estranged; Jo<U+00E3>o lived in the [[Mafra National Palace]] and Carlota Joaquina in [[Ramalh<U+00E3>o Palace]].{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=7}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=12}} Pedro and his siblings resided in the Queluz Palace with their grandmother Maria&nbsp;I, far from their parents,{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=7}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=12}} whom they saw only during state occasions at Queluz.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=7}}

In late November 1807, when Pedro was nine, [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|the royal family escaped from Portugal]] as an invading French army sent by [[Napoleon]] approached Lisbon. Pedro and his family arrived in [[Rio de Janeiro]], capital of the [[Colonial Brazil|Viceroyalty of Brazil]], then Portugal's largest and wealthiest colony, in March 1808.<ref>See:

* {{harvnb|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=34, 47}}.
</ref> During the voyage, Pedro read [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]] and conversed with the ship's crew, picking up [[navigation]]al skills.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=39,41}}{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=22}} In Brazil, after a brief stay in the [[Pa<U+00E7>o Imperial|City Palace]], Pedro settled with his younger brother [[Miguel I of Portugal|Miguel]] and their father in the [[Pa<U+00E7>o de S<U+00E3>o Crist<U+00F3>v<U+00E3>o|Palace of S<U+00E3>o Crist<U+00F3>v<U+00E3>o]] (Saint Christopher).{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=29}} Although never on intimate terms with his father, Pedro loved him and resented the constant humiliation his father suffered at the hands of Carlota Joaquina.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=7}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=125, 128}} As an adult, Pedro would openly call his mother, for whom he held only feelings of contempt, a "bitch".{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=189}}

Early experiences of betrayal, coldness and neglect had a great impact on the formation of Pedro's character.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=7}} A modicum of stability during his childhood was provided by his ''aia'' (governess), Dona Maria Genoveva do R<U+00EA>go e Matos, whom he loved as a mother,{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=33}}{{sfn|Calmon|1950|p=33}} and by his ''aio'' (supervisor) friar Ant<U+00F3>nio de Arr<U+00E1>bida, who became his mentor.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=22}} Both were in charge of Pedro's upbringing and attempted to furnish him with a suitable education. His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, [[political economy]], logic, history and geography.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=32}} He learned to speak and write not only in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], but also [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]].<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=116}},
* {{harvnb|Costa|1995|pp=99<U+2013>101}},
* {{harvnb|Lustosa|2006|p=70}}.
</ref> He could translate from [[English language|English]] and understood [[German language|German]].{{sfn|Costa|1995|p=101}} Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least two hours of each day to study and reading.{{sfn|Costa|1995|p=101}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=121}}

Despite the breadth of Pedro's instruction, his education proved lacking. Historian Ot<U+00E1>vio Tarqu<U+00ED>nio de Sousa said that Pedro "was without a shadow of doubt intelligent, quick-witted, [and] perspicacious."{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=101}} However, historian Roderick J. Barman relates that he was by nature "too ebullient, too erratic, and too emotional". He remained impulsive and never learned to exercise self-control or to assess the consequences of his decisions and adapt his outlook to changes in situations.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=17}} His father never allowed anyone to discipline him.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=32}} While Pedro's schedule dictated two hours of study each day, he sometimes circumvented the routine by dismissing his instructors in favor of activities that he found more interesting.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=32}}

The prince found fulfillment in activities that required physical skills, rather than in the classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro [[Horse training|trained unbroken horses]], and became a fine horseman and an excellent [[farrier]].{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=46}}{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=58}} On horseback, he and his brother Miguel exhibited great stamina and boldness. They enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=46}} He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts. He arranged for a personal workshop where he applied himself to wood carving and furniture making.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=36}} In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of [[Marcos Portugal]] the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with the [[flute]], [[trombone]], [[harpsicord]], [[bassoon]], [[violin]] and [[guitar]], often using the latter to play popular songs and dances such as the ''[[Lundu (dance)|lundu]]'', ''[[modinha]]'' and ''[[fado]]''.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=37}}

Pedro's character was marked by an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with a tendency to be domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances with women in addition to his hunting and equestrian activities.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=134}} His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure,{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=252}} and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=51}} He rarely drank alcohol,{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=71}} but was an incorrigible womanizer.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=76}} His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called No<U+00E9>mi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him. Pedro's father, who had ascended the throne as Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince's betrothal to Archduchess [[Maria Leopoldina of Austria|Maria Leopoldina]], daughter of Emperor Franz&nbsp;I of Austria (formerly [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz&nbsp;II, Holy Roman Emperor]]).{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=78<U+2013>80}}{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=53}}

On 13 May 1817, Pedro was [[proxy marriage|married by proxy]] to Maria Leopoldina.{{sfn|Costa|1972|p=42}}{{sfn|Calmon|1950|p=44}} When she arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 5 November, she immediately fell in love with Pedro, who was far more charming and attractive than she had been led to expect. After "years under a tropical sun, his complexion was still light, his cheeks rosy." The 19-year-old prince was handsome and a little above average in height, with bright dark eyes and dark brown hair.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=46}} "His good appearance", said historian [[Neill W. Macaulay, Jr.|Neill Macaulay]], "owned much to his bearing, proud and erect even at an awkward age, and his grooming, which was impeccable. Habitually neat and clean, he had taken to the Brazilian custom of bathing often."{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=46}} The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy, occurred the following day.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=96}} Seven children resulted from this marriage: Maria (later Queen Dona [[Maria&nbsp;II of Portugal]]), [[Miguel, Prince of Beira|Miguel]], [[Jo<U+00E3>o Carlos, Prince of Beira|Jo<U+00E3>o]], [[Princess Janu<U+00E1>ria of Brazil|Janu<U+00E1>ria]], [[Princess Paula of Brazil|Paula]], [[Princess Francisca of Brazil|Francisca]] and Pedro (later Emperor Dom [[Pedro&nbsp;II of Brazil]]).{{sfn|Calmon|1950|p=49}}

He can be seen at the middle of the balcony raising his hat]]
On 17 October 1820, news arrived that the military garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to what became known as the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]]. The military formed a provisional government, supplanting the regency appointed by Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI, and summoned the ''Cortes''<U+2014>the centuries-old Portuguese parliament, this time democratically elected with the aim of creating a national Constitution.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=64}} Pedro was surprised when his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided to send him to Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and to placate the revolutionaries.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=68}} The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona [[Teresa, Princess of Beira|Maria Teresa]]: Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI had relied on her for advice, and it was she who had been given membership in the [[privy council|Council of State]].{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=47<U+2013>48}}

Pedro was regarded with suspicion by his father and by the king's close advisers, all of whom clung to the principles of [[absolute monarchy]]. By contrast, the prince was a well-known, staunch supporter of [[liberalism]] and of constitutional representative monarchy. He had read the works of [[Voltaire]], [[Benjamin Constant]], [[Gaetano Filangieri]] and [[Edmund Burke]].<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=121<U+2013>122}},

</ref> Even his wife Leopoldina remarked, "My husband, God help us, loves the new ideas."{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=123}}{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=93}} Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI postponed Pedro's departure for as long as possible, fearing that once he was in Portugal, he would be acclaimed king by the revolutionaries.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=68}}

On 26 February 1821, Portuguese troops stationed in Rio de Janeiro mutinied. Although safely ensconced a few miles from the city at S<U+00E3>o Crist<U+00F3>v<U+00E3>o, neither Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI nor his government made any move against the mutinous units. Pedro decided to act on his own and rode to meet the rebels. He negotiated with them and convinced his father to accept their demands, which included naming a new cabinet and making an oath of obedience to the forthcoming Portuguese Constitution.<ref>See:

</ref> On 21 April, the parish electors of Rio de Janeiro met at the Merchants' Exchange to elect their representatives to the ''Cortes''. A small group of agitators seized the meeting and formed a revolutionary government. Again, Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI and his ministers remained passive, and the monarch was about to accept the revolutionaries' demands when Pedro took the initiative and sent army troops to re-establish order at the Merchants' Exchange.<ref>See:

Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat,{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=175}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=185}} or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=255}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=121}} He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=177}} At the outset of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that guaranteed personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=93}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=232<U+2013>233}} Property owners were protected from having their lands confiscated, and no citizen could thenceforth be arrested without a written warrant, unless caught in the process of committing a crime. Suspects could no longer be held for more than 48 hours without being charged and were entitled to representation. Torture, secret trials, and inhumane restraints were also abolished.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=96}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=231<U+2013>232}} Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=96}}

On 5 June, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general [[Jorge Avilez, 1st Count of Avilez|Jorge Avilez]] (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. As he had done on the previous 26 February, the prince personally rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning the respect of the troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=74}}{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=114}} The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'<U+00E9>tat that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez.<ref>See:

The continuing crisis reached a point of no return when the ''Cortes'' dissolved the central government in Rio de Janeiro and ordered Pedro's return.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=264}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=81}} This was perceived by Brazilians as an attempt to subordinate their country again to Portugal<U+2014>Brazil had not been a colony since 1815 and had the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|status of a kingdom]].{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|pp=264<U+2013>265}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=82}} On 9 January 1822, Pedro was presented with a petition containing 8,000 signatures that begged him not to leave.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=83}}{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=107}} He replied, "Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing.

In the months following 7 September, Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI was still recognized as the rightful ruler of the independent Kingdom of Brazil.{{sfn|Viana|1966|pp=13<U+2013>14}} Brazil's independence movement was not directed against the King, who was regarded as merely a figurehead dominated by the ''Cortes''.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=95}} The prince regent was only later persuaded to accept the Brazilian crown as emperor, not king. Pedro, however, made it clear that, if his father returned to Brazil, he would relinquish the throne.{{sfn|Lima|1997|p=404}} He was acclaimed Emperor Dom Pedro&nbsp;I on his 24th birthday, which coincided with the inauguration of the [[Empire of Brazil]] on 12 October. He was crowned on 1 December. His ascendancy did not immediately extend throughout Brazil's territories. He had to force the submission of several provinces in the [[North Region, Brazil|northern]], [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern]] and [[South Region, Brazil|southern]] regions, and the last Portuguese holdout units only surrendered in early 1824.{{sfn|Viana|1994|pp=420<U+2013>422}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|pp=104<U+2013>106}}

Meanwhile, Pedro&nbsp;I's relationship with Bonif<U+00E1>cio deteriorated. Although the Emperor had once regarded him as a mentor,{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 1|p=307}}{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=139}} Pedro&nbsp;I began to chafe in the subservient position of neophyte to Bonif<U+00E1>cio's role as schoolmaster.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=110}} The situation came to a head when Pedro&nbsp;I, on the grounds of inappropriate conduct, dismissed Bonif<U+00E1>cio and his brother [[Martim Francisco de Andrada]] from their ministry portfolios. Authoritarian and abusive, Bonif<U+00E1>cio had used his position to harass, prosecute, arrest and even exile his political enemies.<ref>See:

</ref> For months Bonif<U+00E1>cio's enemies had worked to win over the Emperor. While Pedro&nbsp;I was still Prince Regent, they had given him the title "Perpetual Defender of Brazil" on 13 May 1822.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=92}} They also inducted him into Freemasonry on 2 August{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=121}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=272}} and later made him grand master on 7 October, replacing Bonif<U+00E1>cio in that position.<ref>See:

The crisis between the monarch and his former minister was felt immediately within the [[Constituent assembly|Constituent and Legislative General Assembly]], which had been elected for the purpose of drafting a Constitution.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=120}} A member of the Constituent Assembly, Bonif<U+00E1>cio resorted to demagoguery, alleging the existence of a major Portuguese conspiracy against Brazilian interests<U+2014>insinuating that Pedro&nbsp;I, who had been born in Portugal, was implicated.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=153<U+2013>154}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=116}} The Emperor became outraged by the invective directed at the loyalty of citizens who were of Portuguese birth and the hints that he was himself conflicted in his allegiance to Brazil.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=117}} On 12 November 1823, Pedro&nbsp;I ordered the [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolution]] of the Constituent Assembly and called for new elections.<ref>See:

As a result of the highly centralized State created by the Constitution, rebellious elements in [[Cear<U+00E1>]], [[Para<U+00ED>ba]] and [[Pernambuco]] attempted to secede from Brazil and unite in what became known as the [[Confederation of the Equator]].{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=165}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=122}} Pedro&nbsp;I unsuccessfully sought to avoid bloodshed by offering to placate the rebels.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=165}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=121}} Angry, he said: "What did the insults from Pernambuco require? Surely a punishment, and such a punishment that it will serve as an example for the future."{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=165}} The rebels were never able to secure control over their provinces, and were easily suppressed.

== Crises within and without ==
=== Portuguese dynastic affair ===

After long negotiations, Portugal signed a treaty with Brazil on 29 August 1825 in which it recognized Brazilian independence.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Barman|1988|p=128}},
* {{harvnb|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=193}},
* {{harvnb|Macaulay|1986|p=184}}.
</ref> Except for the recognition of independence, the treaty provisions were at Brazil's expense, including a demand for reparations to be paid to Portugal, with no other requirements of Portugal. Compensation was to be paid to all Portuguese citizens residing in Brazil for the losses they had experienced, such as properties which had been confiscated. Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI was also given the right to style himself emperor of Brazil.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Barman|1988|pp=140<U+2013>141}},
* {{harvnb|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|pp=195<U+2013>197}},
* {{harvnb|Macaulay|1986|pp=184<U+2013>185}}.
</ref> More humiliating was that the treaty implied that independence had been granted as a beneficent act of Jo<U+00E3>o&nbsp;VI, rather than having been compelled by the Brazilians through force of arms.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=140}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=195}} Even worse, Great Britain was rewarded for its role in advancing the negotiations by the signing of a separate treaty in which its favorable commercial rights were renewed and by the signing of a convention in which Brazil agreed to abolish slave trade with Africa within four years. Both accords were severely harmful to Brazilian economic interests.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=141}}{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=186}}

A few months later, the Emperor received word that his father had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom Pedro&nbsp;IV.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=142}} Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal{{efn|name=B}} on 2 May{{sfn|Morato|1835|p=26}}{{sfn|Branco|1838|p=XXXVII}} in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona Maria&nbsp;II. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and Maria&nbsp;II was to marry his brother Miguel.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=142}} Pedro&nbsp;I had envisioned this union since 1822 and had attempted to convince Miguel to return to Brazil. The Emperor wrote to him then: "There will be no shortage of people who tell you not to leave ... Tell them to eat shit. And they'll say that with Brazil seceding you're going to be King of Portugal: tell them to do it again."{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=118}} Regardless of the abdication, Pedro&nbsp;I continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=148}} He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=148}}

Miguel feigned compliance with Pedro&nbsp;I's plans. As soon as he was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom Miguel&nbsp;I.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=226}} As painful as was his beloved brother's betrayal, Pedro&nbsp;I also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, [[Teresa, Princess of Beira|Maria Teresa]], [[Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal|Maria Francisca]], [[Infanta Isabel Maria of Portugal|Isabel Maria]] and [[Infanta Maria da Assun<U+00E7><U+00E3>o of Portugal|Maria da Assun<U+00E7><U+00E3>o]], to Miguel&nbsp;I's faction.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=295}} Only his youngest sister, [[Infanta Ana de Jesus Maria of Portugal|Ana de Jesus]], remained faithful to him,{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=295}} and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=255}} Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that Miguel&nbsp;I had murdered their father,{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=239}} Pedro&nbsp;I turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for Maria&nbsp;II's rights.{{sfn|Barman|1988|pp=147<U+2013>148}}

=== War and widowhood ===
[[File:Celebration for the return of Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I 1826.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A large crowd of people and mounted horsemen fill a large public square before the steps of a twin-spired baroque church|Celebration in S<U+00E3>o Francisco de Paula square, [[Rio de Janeiro]] city, for the return of Pedro&nbsp;I from [[Bahia]], 4 April 1826]]
Backed by the [[United Provinces of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] (present-day [[Argentina]]), a small band declared Brazil's southernmost province of [[Cisplatina]] to be independent in April 1825.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=125}} The Brazilian government at first perceived the secession attempt as a minor uprising. It took months before a greater threat posed by the involvement of the United Provinces, which expected to annex Cisplatina, caused serious concern. In retaliation, the Empire declared war in December, triggering the [[Cisplatine War]].{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=128}} The Emperor traveled to [[Bahia]] province (located in [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern Brazil]]) in February 1826, taking along his wife and daughter Maria. The Emperor was warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of Bahia.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=206}} The trip was planned to generate support for the war-effort.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=190}}

The imperial entourage included [[Domitila de Castro, Marchioness of Santos|Domitila de Castro]] (then-Viscountess and later Marchioness of Santos), who had been Pedro&nbsp;I's [[Royal mistress|mistress]] since their first meeting in 1822. Although he had never been faithful to Maria Leopoldina, he had previously been careful to conceal his sexual escapades with other women.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=168, 190}} However, his infatuation for his new lover "had become both blatant and limitless",{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=146}} while his wife endured slights and became the object of gossip.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=146}} Pedro&nbsp;I was increasingly rude and mean toward Maria Leopoldina, left her short of funds, prohibited her from leaving the palace and forced her to endure Domitila's presence as her [[lady-in-waiting]].{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|pp=192, 231, 236}}{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=16}} In the meantime, his lover took advantage by advancing her interests, as well as those of her family and friends. Those seeking favors or to promote projects increasingly sought her help, bypassing the normal, legal channels.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=136}}

On 24 November 1826, Pedro&nbsp;I sailed from Rio de Janeiro to [[S<U+00E3>o Jos<U+00E9>, Santa Catarina|S<U+00E3>o Jos<U+00E9>]] in the province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. From there he rode to [[Porto Alegre]], capital of the province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], where the main army was stationed.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=201<U+2013>202}} Upon his arrival on 7 December, the Emperor found the military conditions to be much worse than previous reports had led him to expect. He "reacted with his customary energy: he passed a flurry of orders, fired reputed grafters and incompetents, fraternized with the troops, and generally shook up military and civilian administration."{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=202}} He was already on his way back to Rio de Janeiro{{sfn|Rangel|1928|pp=178<U+2013>179}} when he was told that Maria Leopoldina had died following a miscarriage.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=202}}{{sfn|Costa|1972|pp=123<U+2013>124}} Unfounded rumors soon spread through the Brazilian capital that purported that she had died after being physically assaulted by Pedro&nbsp;I.{{efn|name=C}}

The war continued on with no conclusion in sight. In June 1828, [[Irish and German Mercenary Soldiers' Revolt|Irish and German mercenaries mutinied]] in Rio de Janeiro.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=207<U+2013>210}}{{sfn|Costa|1995|pp=121<U+2013>128}} Discontented with the harsh conditions of military life in Brazil, the foreigners readily accepted bribes from the United Provinces to not only rebel, but to also capture the Emperor so that he could be held hostage as a bargaining chip.{{sfn|Costa|1995|pp=126<U+2013>138}}{{sfn|Calmon|1950|p=173}} The mercenary mutiny was put down with much bloodshed. Pedro&nbsp;I relinquished Cisplatina soon afterward, in August, and the province became the independent nation of [[Uruguay]].{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=211}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=151}}

=== Second marriage ===

After his wife's death, Pedro&nbsp;I realized how miserably he had treated her, and his relationship with Domitila began to crumble. Maria Leopoldina, unlike his mistress, was popular, honest and loved him without expecting anything in return. The Emperor greatly missed her, and even his obsession with Domitila failed to overcome his sense of loss and regret.{{sfn|Barman|1999|p=24}} One day Domitila found him weeping on the floor and embracing a portrait of his deceased wife, whose sad-looking ghost Pedro&nbsp;I claimed to have seen.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Rangel|1928|p=193}},
* {{harvnb|Lustosa|2006|p=250}},
* {{harvnb|Costa|1995|p=88}},
* {{harvnb|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=260}}.
</ref> Later on, the Emperor left the bed he shared with Domitila and shouted: "Get off of me! I know I live an unworthy life of a sovereign. The thought of the Empress does not leave me."{{sfn|Costa|1995|p=88}}{{sfn|Rangel|1928|p=195}} He did not forget his children, orphaned of their mother, and was observed on more than one occasion holding his son, the young Pedro, in his arms and saying: "Poor boy, you are the most unhappy prince in the world."{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=250}}

At the insistence of Pedro&nbsp;I, Domitila departed from Rio de Janeiro on 27 June 1828.{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=262}} He had resolved to marry again and to become a better person. He even tried to persuade his father-in-law of his sincerity, by claiming in a letter "that all my wickedness is over, that I shall not again fall into those errors into which I have fallen, which I regret and have asked God for forgiveness".{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=252}} Franz&nbsp;II was less than convinced. The Austrian emperor, deeply offended by the conduct his daughter endured, withdrew his support for Brazilian concerns and frustrated Pedro&nbsp;I's Portuguese interests.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=147}}

Because of Pedro&nbsp;I's bad reputation in Europe, owing to his past behavior, princesses from several nations declined his proposals of marriage one after another.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=226}} His pride thus wounded, he allowed his mistress to return, which she did on 29 April 1829 after having been away nearly a year.{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=252}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=320}} However, once he learned that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his relationship to Domitila once and for all. She returned to her native province of S<U+00E3>o Paulo on 27 August, where she remained.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=326}} Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to [[Am<U+00E9>lie of Leuchtenberg]].{{sfn|Costa|1995|p=94}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=8}} Despite her lower rank by birth,{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=284}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=7}} he was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person.{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=285}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=15}} The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=235}}{{sfn|Rangel|1928|p=274}}

Since the days of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 with the opening of the General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological struggle over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared Pedro&nbsp;I's views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament.<ref>See:
* {{harvnb|Barman|1988|pp=114, 131, 134, 137<U+2013>139, 143<U+2013>146, 150}},

</ref>

Regardless of Pedro&nbsp;I's failures as a ruler, he respected the Constitution: he did not tamper with elections or countenance vote rigging,{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=193}} refuse to [[Countersign (legal)|sign]] acts ratified by the government,{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=195, 219, 221}} or impose any restrictions on freedom of speech.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=x, 193, 229}}{{sfn|Viana|1994|p=445}} Although within his prerogative, he did not [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolve]] the Chamber of Deputies and call for new elections when it disagreed with his aims or postpone seating the legislature.{{sfn|Viana|1994|p=476}} Liberal newspapers and pamphlets seized on Pedro&nbsp;I's Portuguese birth in support of both valid accusations (e.g., that much of his energy was directed toward affairs concerning Portugal){{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=229}} and false charges (e.g., that he was involved in plots to suppress the Constitution and to reunite Brazil and Portugal).{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=244}} To the Liberals, the Emperor's Portuguese-born friends who were part of the Imperial court, including [[Francisco Gomes da Silva]] who was nicknamed "the Buffoon", were part of these conspiracies and formed a "[[Shadow government (conspiracy)|secret cabinet]]".{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Calmon|1950|pp=155<U+2013>158}} None of these figures exhibited interest in such issues, and whatever interests they may have shared, there was no palace cabal plotting to abrogate the Constitution or to bring Brazil back under Portugal's control.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=174}}

Another source of criticism by the Liberals involved Pedro&nbsp;I's abolitionist views.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=216<U+2013>217, 246}} The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation was in the hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=215}}{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|pp=129, 131}} The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=214}}{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=131}} Pedro&nbsp;I also professed other advanced ideas. When the Emperor declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the Emperor refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the [[divine right of kings]], of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: "It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that my blood is the same color as that of the Negroes."{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=108}}{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|pp=128<U+2013>129}}

After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere.

The Emperor's efforts to appease the Liberal Party resulted in very important changes. He supported an 1827 law that established [[Individual ministerial responsibility|ministerial responsibility]].{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=195}} On 19 March 1831, he named a cabinet formed by politicians drawn from the opposition,{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=159}} allowing a greater role for the parliament in the government. Lastly, he offered positions in Europe to Francisco Gomes and another Portuguese-born friend to extinguish rumors of a "secret cabinet".{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=156}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=44}}

To his dismay, his palliative measures did not stop the continuous attacks from the Liberal side upon his government and his foreign birth. Frustrated by their intransigence, he became unwilling to deal with his deteriorating political situation.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=156}} Meanwhile, Portuguese exiles campaigned to convince him to give up on Brazil and instead devote his energies to the fight for his daughter's claim to Portugal's crown.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=157}} According to Roderick J. Barman, "[in] an emergency the Emperor's abilities shone forth<U+2014>he became cool in nerve, resourceful and steadfast in action. Life as a constitutional monarch, full of tedium, caution, and conciliation, ran against the essence of his character."{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=138}} On the other hand, the historian remarked, he "found in his daughter's case everything that appealed most to his character. By going to Portugal he could champion the oppressed, display his chivalry and self-denial, uphold constitutional rule, and enjoy the freedom of action he craved."{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=157}}

The idea of abdicating and returning to Portugal took root in his mind, and, beginning in early 1829, he talked about it frequently.<ref>See:

</ref> An opportunity soon appeared to act upon the notion. Radicals within the Liberal Party rallied street gangs to harass the Portuguese community in Rio de Janeiro. On 11 March 1831, in what became known as the "''noite das garrafadas''" (night of the broken bottles), the Portuguese retaliated and turmoil gripped the streets of the national capital.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=246<U+2013>147}}{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=158}} On 5 April, Pedro&nbsp;I fired the Liberal cabinet, which had only been in power since 19 March, for its incompetence in restoring order.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=159}}{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=250}} A large crowd, incited by the radicals, gathered in Rio de Janeiro downtown on the afternoon of 6 April and demanded the immediate restoration of the fallen cabinet.<ref>See:

[[File:Pedro I of Brazil 1833.jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Lithographic half-length portrait depicting a middle-aged man with a full beard and wearing a military tunic with epaulets, sash and large medal|Pedro, Duke of Braganza, at age 35, 1833. After their invasion of Portugal, he and his soldiers swore not to shave their beards until [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria&nbsp;II]] was restored.{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=323}}]]
At dawn on the morning of 7 April, Pedro, his wife and others, including his daughter Maria&nbsp;II and his sister Ana de Jesus, were taken on board the British warship [[HMS Warspite (1807)|HMS ''Warspite'']]. The vessel remained at anchor off Rio de Janeiro, and, on 13 April, the former emperor transferred to and departed for Europe aboard [[HMS Volage (1825)|HMS ''Volage'']].{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=254<U+2013>257}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|pp=117, 119, 142<U+2013>143}} He arrived in [[Cherbourg-Octeville]], France, on 10 June.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=257}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|pp=149, 151}} During the next few months, he shuttled between France and Great Britain. He was warmly welcomed by, but received no actual support from, either government.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=257<U+2013>260, 262}} Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of [[Duke of Braganza]] on 15 June, a position that once had been his as heir to Portugal's crown. Although the title should have belonged to Maria&nbsp;II's heir, which he certainly was not, his claim was met with general recognition.{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=158}}{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=259}} On 1 December, his only daughter by Am<U+00E9>lie, [[Princess Maria Am<U+00E9>lia of Brazil|Maria Am<U+00E9>lia]], was born in Paris.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=267}}

He did not forget his children left in Brazil under the guardianship of Jos<U+00E9> Bonif<U+00E1>cio. He wrote poignant letters to each of them, conveying how greatly he missed them and repeatedly asking them to seriously attend to their educations. Shortly before his abdication, Pedro had told his son and successor: "I intend that my brother Miguel and I will be the last badly educated of the Braganza family".{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=281}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=36}} [[Charles Napier (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Napier]], a naval commander who fought under Pedro's banner in the 1830s, remarked that "his good qualities were his own; his bad owing to want of education; and no man was more sensible of that defect than himself."{{sfn|Costa|1995|p=117}}{{sfn|Jorge|1972|p=203}}

His letters to Pedro&nbsp;II were often couched in language beyond the boy's reading level, and historians have assumed such passages were chiefly intended as advice that the young monarch might eventually consult upon reaching adulthood.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=257}} A notable passage in a missive to Pedro II gives a powerful insight into the Duke of Braganza's political philosophy: "The era in which princes were respected solely because they are simply princes has ended; in the century in which we live, in which the peoples are quite well informed of their rights, it is necessary that princes should be and also should know that they are men and not divinities, that for them knowledge and good sense are indispensable so that they are the more quickly loved than respected." He concluded: "The respect of a free people for their ruler ought to be born of the conviction which they hold that their ruler is capable of making them achieve that level of felicity they aspire to; and if such is not the case, unhappy ruler, unhappy people."<ref>See:

While in Paris, the Duke of Braganza met and befriended [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Gilbert du Motier, Marquis of Lafayette]], a veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]] who became one of his staunchest supporters.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=259}}{{sfn|Lustosa|2006|p=306}} Pedro bade farewell to his family, Lafayette and around two hundred well-wishers on 25 January 1832. He knelt before Maria&nbsp;II and said: "My lady, here is a Portuguese general who will uphold your rights and restore your crown." In tears, his daughter embraced him.<ref>See:

=== Death ===
{{seealso|First Carlist War}}
[[File:Pedro I of Brazil dead 1834.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=A lithograph depicting a curtained bed on which lies a bearded man with closed eyes and a crucifix lying on his chest|Pedro on his deathbed, 1834]]
Severely outnumbered, Pedro's army of liberals was [[siege of Porto|besieged in Porto]] for more than a year. There, in early 1833, he received news from Jos<U+00E9> Bonif<U+00E1>cio in Brazil of his daughter [[Princess Paula of Brazil|Paula]]'s impending death. Pedro made two requests of his children's guardian: "the first is to keep for me a bit of her beautiful hair; the second is to place her in the convent of Our Lady of Good Aid and in the same spot where her good mother, my Leopoldina for whom even today I still shed tears of longing, is located ... I ask you as a father, as a pitiful desolate father, to do me a favor and go in person to deposit next to the body of her mother this fruit of her womb and on this occasion pray for one and other."{{sfn|Santos|2011|p=29}}

Months later, in September, he met with [[Ant<U+00F4>nio Carlos de Andrada]], a brother of Bonif<U+00E1>cio who had come from Brazil. As a representative of the Restorationist Party, Antonio Carlos asked the Duke of Braganza to return to Brazil and rule his former empire as regent during his son's minority. Pedro realized that the Restorationists wanted to use him as a tool to facilitate their own rise to power, and frustrated Ant<U+00F4>nio Carlos by making almost impossible demands, to ascertain whether the Brazilian people, and not merely a faction, truly wanted him back. He insisted that any request to return as regent be constitutionally valid. The people's will would have to be conveyed through their local representatives and his appointment approved by the General Assembly. Only then, and "upon the presentation of a petition to him in Portugal by an official delegation of the Brazilian parliament" would he consider accepting.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=293}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=287}}

During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate among the rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were shot or blown to pieces.<ref>See:

</ref> His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of dividing his forces and sending a portion to launch an [[amphibious attack]] on southern Portugal. The [[Algarve]] region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=290}} Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos]], who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Do<U+00F1>a [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel&nbsp;II]], intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[First Carlist War]], the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to Isabel&nbsp;II and defeated both Miguel&nbsp;I and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|pp=295, 297<U+2013>298}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|pp=291, 293<U+2013>294}}

He warned them: "Slavery is an evil, and an attack against the rights and dignity of the human species, but its consequences are less harmful to those who suffer in captivity than to the Nation whose laws allow slavery. It is a cancer that devours its morality."{{sfn|Jorge|1972|pp=198<U+2013>199}} After a long and painful illness, Pedro died at 14:30 on 24 September 1834.<ref>See:

Upon the death of Pedro&nbsp;I, the then-powerful Restorationist Party vanished overnight.{{sfn|Barman|1988|p=178}} A fair assessment of the former monarch became possible once the threat of his return to power was removed. [[Evaristo da Veiga]], one of his worst critics as well as a leader in the Liberal Party, left a statement which, according to historian Ot<U+00E1>vio Tarqu<U+00ED>nio de Sousa, became the prevailing view thereafter:{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|p=309}} "the former emperor of Brazil was not a prince of ordinary measure&nbsp;... and Providence has made him a powerful instrument of liberation, both in Brazil and in Portugal. If we [Brazilians] exist as a body in a free Nation, if our land was not ripped apart into small enemy republics, where only anarchy and military spirit predominated, we owe much to the resolution he took in remaining among us, in making the first shout for our Independence." He continued: "Portugal, if it was freed from the darkest and demeaning tyranny ... if it enjoys the benefits brought by representative government to learned peoples, it owes it to D[om]. Pedro de Alc<U+00E2>ntara, whose fatigues, sufferings and sacrifices for the Portuguese cause has earned him in high degree the tribute of national gratitude."{{sfn|Jorge|1972|p=204}}{{sfn|Sousa 1972, Vol 3|pp=309, 312}}

John Armitage, who lived in Brazil during the latter half of Pedro&nbsp;I's reign, remarked that "even the errors of the Monarch have been attended with great benefit through their influence on the affairs of the mother country. Had he governed with more wisdom it would have been well for the land of his adoption, yet, perhaps, unfortunate for humanity." Armitage added that like "the late Emperor of the French, he was also a child of destiny, or rather, an instrument in the hands of an all-seeing and beneficent Providence for the furtherance of great and inscrutable ends. In the old as in the new world he was henceforth fated to become the instrument of further revolutions, and ere the close of his brilliant but ephemeral career in the land of his fathers, to atone amply for the errors and follies of his former life, by his chivalrous and heroic devotion in the cause of civil and religious freedom."{{sfn|Armitage 1836, Vol 2|pp=139<U+2013>140}}

In 1972, on the 150th anniversary of Brazilian independence, Pedro&nbsp;I's remains (though not his heart) were brought to Brazil<U+2014>as he had requested in his will<U+2014>accompanied by much fanfare and with honors due to a head of state. His remains were reinterred in the [[Monument to the Independence of Brazil]], along with those of Maria Leopoldina and Am<U+00E9>lie, in the city of S<U+00E3>o Paulo.{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=305}}{{sfn|Calmon|1975|p=900}} Years later, [[Neill W. Macaulay, Jr.|Neill Macaulay]] said that "[c]riticism of Dom Pedro was freely expressed and often vehement; it prompted him to abdicate two thrones. His tolerance of public criticism and his willingness to relinquish power set Dom Pedro apart from his absolutist predecessors and from the rulers of today's coercive states, whose lifetime tenure is as secure as that of the kings of old." Macaulay affirmed that "[s]uccessful liberal leaders like Dom Pedro may be honored with an occasional stone or bronze monument, but their portraits, four stories high, do not shape public buildings; their pictures are not borne in parades of hundreds of thousands of uniformed marchers; no '-isms' attach to their names."{{sfn|Macaulay|1986|p=x}}

| Of the two eyewitness accounts of 7 September 1822 that mention Prince Dom Pedro's mount, that of Father Belquior Pinheiro de Oliveira on 7 September 1826 and that of Manuel Marcondes de Oliveira e Melo (later Baron of Pindamonhangaba) on 14 April 1862, both say that it was a ''besta baia'' (bay beast) {{harv|Costa 1972, Vol 295|pp=74, 80}}. In a work published in 1853 and based on an interview with another eyewitness, Colonel Ant<U+00F4>nio Leite Pereira da Gama Lobo, historian Paulo Ant<U+00F4>nio do Vale said that it was a "''zaino''" ([[Bay (horse)|bay horse]]) {{harv|Costa 1972, Vol 295|pp=75, 80}}. The words used, "bay beast" and "bay horse", are at first glance, both similar and confusingly vague. In Portuguese, as in English, a beast is any non-human animal especially a large four-footed mammal. However, formerly in Brazil beast also meant "[[mare]]" (a female horse) as may be seen in dictionaries published in 1946 {{harv|Freira|1946|p=1022}} and 1968 {{harv|Carvalho|1968|p=158}}, although this usage has since been discontinued except in Brazil's [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeast]] and [[North Region, Brazil|northern]] regions {{harv|Houaiss|Villar|2009|p=281}}. The use of ''besta'' to refer to a mare is still in use in Portugal {{harv|Dicion<U+00E1>rios Editora|1997|p=205}}. Thus, the description of a "bay horse" wih non-defined sex and "bay beast (mare)" do in fact coincide. Two of Pedro's biographers, Pedro Calmon {{harv|Calmon|1975|p=97}} and [[Neill W. Macaulay, Jr.|Neill Macaulay]] {{harv|Macaulay|1986|p=125}} have identified his horse as a bay mare. Pedro, who was an outstanding horseman and making an average of 108&nbsp;kilometers per day, was able to ride this animal from the city of S<U+00E3>o Paulo back to the capital of Rio de Janeiro in just five days, leaving his guard and his entourage far behind {{harv|Costa 1972, Vol 295|p=131}}. Francisco Gomes da Silva, "the Buffoon", the second person to arrive, lagged behind the Prince by some eight hours {{harv|Costa 1972, Vol 295|p=133}}.

| Pedro&nbsp;I gave up more than just the crowns of Portugal and Brazil. Less known is that he was also offered the crown of Greece in April 1822 (while he was still prince regent) by the Greek government which was embroiled in a [[Greek War of Independence|fight for national independence]]. Pedro&nbsp;I declined, and eventually [[Otto of Greece|Otto of Bavaria]] became [[Kingdom of Greece|King of Greece]] {{harv|Costa|1995|pp=172<U+2013>173}}. Pedro&nbsp;I also declined offers of the Spanish crown made in 1826 and 1829 by liberals who rebelled against the absolutist rule of his uncle, Don [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Fernando&nbsp;VII]]. The liberals in Portugal and Spain agreed in 1830 to make Pedro&nbsp;I the "Emperor of Iberia". He seems to have declined this offer also, since nothing came of it {{harv|Costa|1995|pp=195<U+2013>197}}. Brazilian historian S<U+00E9>rgio Corr<U+00EA>a da Costa and Portuguese historian Ant<U+00F4>nio Sardinha have argued, however, with little supporting evidence, that one of the inducements which prompted Pedro&nbsp;I to abdicate the Brazilian crown was to dethrone his brother and his uncle and rule the entire [[Iberian Peninsula]] as its emperor {{harv|Costa|1995|pp=197, 199}}.

| Rumors circulated at the time purporting that Pedro&nbsp;I had kicked Maria Leopoldina in the womb during a heated discussion. The quarrel was witnessed by Domitila de Castro and Wenzel Philipp Leopold, Baron von Mareschal. Then serving Maria Leopoldina's father as the Austrian minister in Brazil and thus inclined to reflect her interests, Mareschal was the sole eyewitness who left an account of what actually happened. According to him, the couple had a bitter argument in which they exchanged insults, but there is no mention of physical violence {{harv|Rangel|1928|pp=162<U+2013>163}}{{harv|Calmon|1975|pp=14<U+2013>15}}{{harv|Costa|1995|p=86}}. Historians Alberto Rangel {{harv|Rangel|1928|p=163}}, Pedro Calmon {{harv|Calmon|1950|p=137}}{{harv|Calmon|1975|p=14}}, Ot<U+00E1>vio Tarqu<U+00ED>nio de Sousa {{harv|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=242}}, S<U+00E9>rgio Corr<U+00EA>a da Costa {{harv|Costa|1995|p=86}} and Roderick J. Barman {{harv|Barman|1999|p=17}} have rejected the possibility that Pedro&nbsp;I physically harmed his wife and all affirmed that the altercation was limited to harsh language. As late as 1831, however, these aspersions were still being whispered, serving as a lasting reminder of what people actually believed, regardless of the unfounded nature of the allegations {{harv|Sousa 1972, Vol 2|p=242}}. Barman was categorical when he noted that Maria Leopoldina's death stripped Pedro&nbsp;I of "any remaining aura of sanctity, either at home or abroad"{{harv|Barman|1988|p=147}}.
