He also played for Gloucestershire between 1883 and 1895, scoring one century, and was regularly selected in the prestigious [[Gentlemen v Players]] matches between 1884 and 1894.<ref name=obit/> Although selected for a representative tour to Australia in 1887&ndash;88, he was unable to go. According to ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', his best innings was a score of 93 runs against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]], a team possessing a strong bowling attack, in 1883. Page also played [[Rugby Union|rugby]] for Oxford and Gloucestershire, and [[hockey]] for East Gloucestershire, captaining the latter club for 22 years. Between 1888 and 1923, Page held a teaching post at Cheltenham College.<ref name=obit/>

According to his ''Wisden'' obituary, Page was a "capital batsman, possessing strong defence and good hitting power. He was also a medium-paced bowler with a curl from leg and a break from the off, could keep a good length and was to be relied on. In the field he was hard-working and excellent, being safe in any position.<ref name=obit/> [[Jack Hobbs]] claimed in 1935 that Page was bowling was bowling the [[googly]] while at the University, some time before [[Bernard Bosanquet (cricketer)|Bernard Bosanquet]] is credited with the delivery's invention. Hobbs source was [[Kingsmill Key]], a contemporary of Page at Oxford and later a captain of [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]; however, Key stated that Page merely bowled it as a distraction and never used it in a first-class match.<ref>{{cite book |title=Jack Hobbs: England's Greatest Cricketer |last=McKinstry |first=Leo |isbn=978-0-224-08329-4 |year=2011 |publisher=Yellow Jersey Press |location=London|page = 100}} </ref>
