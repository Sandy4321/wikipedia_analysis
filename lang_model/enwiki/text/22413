'''Christopher E. Gerty''' (born October 19, 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[aerospace engineer]] who worked on [[NASA]]'s [[Constellation Program]].<ref name="NASA Bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/gerty_bio.html|title=NASA - Christopher Gerty Constellation Program Aerospace Engineer

== Education ==
Gerty was born on [[Long Island]] in [[East Moriches]], [[New York]].  His father was an [[insurance underwriter]] for [[Metropolitan Life]].  Gerty has one younger sister.<ref name="NASA Bio"/><ref name="Old Bio">{{Cite web|url=http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/people/bios/space/gerty.html|title=NASA Quest > Space Team Online - Meet:  Chris Gerty|accessdate=August 10, 2011|publisher=NASA|author=Gerty, Chris}}</ref>

Gerty's interest in [[spaceflight]] and NASA began at Gatelot Elementary in [[Lake Ronkonkoma]], New York.  His fifth-grade teacher led his class through the investigation of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' accident]] in 1986.  Gerty's class learned not only about the causes of the accident, but what the [[space shuttle]] did and why humans traveled in [[space]]. To the ten-year-old Gerty, spaceflight seemed like a necessary and noble thing for [[human]]s to do, even if there were some risks.<ref name="NASA Bio"/>

After that experience in elementary school Gerty dreamed of being an [[astronaut]] when he grew up.  Gerty attended [[Hilton High School]] near [[Rochester, New York]], from 1989 to 1990 and [[New Paltz High School]], [[New Paltz, New York]], from 1991 to 1993.  He took up [[skiing]] while in Rochester and [[Floor hockey|floor]] and [[roller hockey]] in New Paltz.<ref name="NASA Bio"/><ref name="Old Bio"/>

Gerty attended [[Clarkson University]] in [[Potsdam, New York]], earning a [[B.S.]] in [[Computer Engineering]] in 1997.<ref name="NASA Bio"/>  He played [[intramural]] [[ice hockey]] while at Clarkson.<ref name="Old Bio"/>  During his college years Gerty realized that flying in space was not his real goal, but rather helping humans explore and extend their sphere of influence to other worlds.  One of the reasons he had chosen Clarkson was that it was part of a [[National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program|Space Grant Consortium]] that received grants from NASA.  Gerty knew that this program only affected graduate students, but that an undergraduate from any school could participate in a NASA cooperative education program.<ref name="NASA Bio"/><ref name="Old Bio"/>  Through Clarkson<U+2019>s career center he applied for and attained a cooperative education program position at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in [[Houston, Texas]], where he worked with [[programmer]]s, [[Aviator|pilots]] and spaceflight procedure writers.  When Gerty finished several co-op tours and graduated, he knew he wanted to work for NASA, and accepted a job offer at JSC as a [[flight controller]].<ref name="NASA Bio"/>

== NASA career ==
[[Image:NEEMO 13 Crew.jpg|thumbnail|right|The NEEMO 13 Crew: Left to right (rear): [[Nicholas Patrick]], Gerty; front: [[Satoshi Furukawa]], [[Richard R. Arnold]].]]
Gerty's NASA experience includes positions as Robotics Division Engineering Co-op from 1996 to 1998; Aircraft Operations Co-op Engineer at [[Ellington Field]] in 1997; and Payloads Flight Controller from 1998 to 2001.  He served as [[Extravehicular Activity]] (EVA or spacewalk) Flight Controller and Crew Trainer in the EVA Systems group in Mission Operations from 2001 to 2006.<ref name="NASA Bio"/><ref name="LinkedIn">{{Cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-gerty/4/75a/61a|title=Christopher Gerty | LinkedIn|accessdate=August 10, 2011|publisher=LinkedIn Corporation|year=2011|author=Gerty, Christopher}}</ref>  In that position he taught astronauts how to keep themselves alive and comfortable enough to perform their tasks while doing a spacewalk, or EVA.  As part of this job he performed a simulated EVA in a NASA [[spacesuit]] at the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]].  After "spacewalking" underwater, he had a new appreciation for the difficulty of the construction of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and the skills of the astronauts who performed ISS construction.<ref name="NASA Bio"/>

After his time in the EVA group, in 2006 Gerty became a [[Constellation Program]] Systems Integration Engineer, helping plan for [[lunar mission]]s.  He worked with a group defining requirements for what humans need to live and work on the surface of the [[Moon]].  The planning covered not only short missions like those of the [[Apollo program]], but long-term missions taking up half a year or more, and covered not only EVAs, but solving the problems of habitation and [[Physiology|physiological]] problems as well.  To do this, the group examined the past Apollo missions, long-duration [[List of International Space Station expeditions|Expeditions]] to the ISS, and "[[Human analog missions|spaceflight analog missions]]" like [[NEEMO]], which in many ways simulate a mission to the Moon.  In Gerty's words:  "NASA has questions like, 'What is the best way for [[robot]]s and humans to work together on the lunar or [[Mars|Martian]] surface?', or 'How much room do astronauts need to live and work in 1/6 of the [[Earth]]<U+2019>s [[gravity]], compared to the [[Zero gravity|zero-gravity]] on the ISS?'"<ref name="NASA Bio"/>

In August 2007, Gerty served as [[Mission Specialist]] #3 during the [[NEEMO#NEEMO 13: August 6<U+2013>15, 2007|NEEMO 13]] project, an exploration research mission held in [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]], the world's only [[Underwater habitat|undersea research laboratory]].  He served as a liaison for the Constellation Program, living underwater for ten days to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight and test lunar and Martian exploration concepts.<ref name="NASA Bio"/><ref name="Blog"/><ref name="thirteen">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2007/jul/HQ_07164_NEEMO_13.html|title=NASA Announces Next Undersea Exploration Mission Dates and Crew|accessdate=August 9, 2011|publisher=NASA|date=2007-07-24|author=NASA}}</ref>  Gerty wrote:

<blockquote>
Spacewalks are very analogous to [[underwater diving|diving]] in the [[ocean]].  In both situations you need a supply of [[oxygen]] to breathe, relative control of [[pressure]] and [[temperature]], a means of moving around in a three-dimensional environment, and protection from the hazards...  The results [of NEEMO 13] will be used to make us more prepared when it is time to put a few more footprints and tire tracks on the moon, and eventually realize the goal of extending the human race to other [[planet]]s!<ref name="NASA Bio"/>
</blockquote>

Since 2010, Gerty has been an Open Government Analyst at NASA.<ref name="LinkedIn"/>  He has a [[blog]] located at http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/cgerty/.<ref name="Blog"/>

== Personal life ==
Gerty is married to Maureen (Smith) Gerty of [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], a [[chemical engineer]] whom he met while in college.  They have two [[German Shepherd]]s and a [[cat]].  Gerty's hobbies include [[bicycling]], [[photography]], [[computer]]s, [[ice hockey]], [[astronomy]], [[camping]] and [[travel]]ing.<ref name="NASA Bio"/><ref name="Old Bio"/>  He is a member of the [[American Astronautical Society]] and has taken part in [[Random Hacks of Kindness]].<ref name="LinkedIn"/><ref name="NDTV">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/hackers-help-fight-natural-disasters-too-79384|title=Hackers help fight natural disasters too!|accessdate=August 10, 2011|publisher=NDTV Convergence Limited|date=2011-01-14|author=[[Indo-Asian News Service]]}}</ref>
