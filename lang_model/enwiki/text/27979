'''William Friese-Greene''' (September 7 1855 - May 5 1921) (born '''William Edward Green''') was a portrait [[photographer]] and prolific [[inventor]]. He is principally known as a pioneer in the field of [[film|motion pictures]] and is credited by some as the inventor of [[cinematography]].

==Career==
William Edward Green was born on September 7, 1855, in [[Bristol]]. He was educated there at [[Queen Elizabeth's Hospital]]. In 1869 he became an apprentice to a photographer named Maurice Guttenberg. By 1875 he had set up his own studios in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and Bristol, and later expanded his business with two more studios in [[London]] and [[Brighton]]. He married Helena Friese on March 24 1874, and decided to modify his name to include her maiden name. 

In Bath he came into contact with [[John Arthur Roebuck Rudge]]. Rudge was a maker of a number of instruments but had begun to specialise in the creation of magic lanterns. He had recently developed the 'Biophantic Lantern'. The lantern was unique in that it could display seven slides in rapid succession, and produce an effective illusion of movement. Friese-Greene was fascinated by the machine and in 1886 he began work with Rudge on enhancing it in order to project photographic plates. They called the device a 'Biophantascope'.  Friese-Greene realised that glass plates would never be a practical medium for true moving pictures and in 1885 he began to experiment with oiled paper and by 1887 was experimenting with [[celluloid]] as a medium for motion picture cameras.

On June 21 1889, Friese-Greene was issued [[patent]] no. 10131 for his 'chronophotographic' camera. It was apparently capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using perforated celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British ''Photographic News'' on  February 28 1890. On 18 March, Friese-Greene sent a clipping of the story to [[Thomas Edison]], whose laboratory had been developing a motion picture system known as the [[Kinetoscope]]. The report was reprinted in ''[[Scientific American]]'' on April 19.<ref>Braun, Marta, ''Picturing Time: The Work of Etienne-Jules Marey (1830<U+2013>1904)'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992/ISBN 0-226-07173-1), p. 190; Robinson, David, ''From Peepshow to Palace: The Birth of American Film'' (New York and Chichester, West Sussex: Columbia University Press, 1997/ISBN 0-231-10338-7), p. 28.</ref> Friese-Greene gave a public demonstration in 1890 but the low [[frame rate]] combined with the device's apparent unreliability failed to make an impression. In the early 1890s he experimented with cameras to create [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] moving images but met with limited success. Friese-Greene<U+2019>s experiments in the field of motion pictures were at the expense of his other business interests and in 1891 he was declared bankrupt. To cover his debts he sold the rights to the 'chronophotographic' camera patent for <U+00A3>500. The renewal fee was never paid and the patent eventually lapsed. 

Friese-Greene's later exploits were in the field of colour in motion pictures. Working in Brighton, he experimented with a system known as '''Biocolour'''. This process produced the illusion of true colour by exposing each alternate frame of ordinary black and white film stock through a two different coloured filters. Each alternate frame of the monochrome print was then stained red or green. Although the projection of Biocolour prints did provide a tolerable illusion of true colour, it suffered from noticeable flickering and red and green fringing when the subject was in rapid motion. 

Friese-Greene found it impossible to exhibit Biocolour motion pictures because a rival system -- developed by [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] and [[Charles Urban]] and known as [[Kinemacolor]] -- claimed that any colour film was an infringement of their prior patent. With the financial assistance of the renowned British racing driver [[Selwyn Edge|Selwyn Francis Edge]], Friese-Greene attempted to invalidate Urban's patent in court. Friese-Greene claimed that the patent did not contain enough detail to encompass the Biocolour process. The judge ruled in Urban's favour, but an appeal in the [[House of Lords]] in 1914 reversed the decision. Friese-Greene's system was still in its infancy and he was unable to exploit this success. His son [[Claude Friese-Greene]] continued to develop the system during 1920s. Claude went on to become a successful cinematographer.

In 1921 Friese-Greene was attending a film and cinema industry meeting in London. The meeting had been called to discuss the current poor state of the British film industry. Disturbed by the tone of the proceedings Friese-Greene got to his feet to speak but soon became incoherent. He was assisted in returning to his seat, and shortly afterward slumped forward and died. His grave can be found in London's [[Highgate Cemetery]]. A memorial designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] describes him as 'The inventor of Kinematography'.

The actor [[Richard Greene]] was his grandson.<ref>{{imdb name|0338901|Richard Greene (I)}}</ref>

==After death==
In 1951 a romanticised account of his life, starring [[Robert Donat]] was filmed as part of the [[Festival of Britain]]. Unfortunately, ''[[The Magic Box (film)|The Magic Box]]'' was not premiered until the Festival was nearly over, and only went on full release after it had finished. Despite the all-star cast and a great deal of publicity, the film was a costly box office flop.<ref>http://www.bufvc.ac.uk/publications/articles/festofbritain.pdf</ref> A pub in the former [[Academy Cinema]] in [[Stokes Croft]], [[Bristol]] is named ''The Magic Box'' in reference to [http://www.flickr.com/photos/bartmaguire/tags/williamfriesegreene Friese-Greene]. (The Magic Box was replaced by Jesters Comedy Club In 2007)

Friese-Greene's former home in Brighton's Middle Street was refurbished in 2006 and is now home to the offices of Worth, a leading media company. The building bears a plaque (in a format designed by [[Eric Gill]] in 1924) commemorating Friese-Green's achievements. The plaque was unveiled by [[Michael Redgrave]], one of the stars of ''[[The Magic Box (film)|The Magic Box]]'', in September 1957. A modern office building a few metres away is named Friese-Greene House. Other notices include the 1930s Kings Road, [[Chelsea, London]], Odeon Cinema, with its iconic facade, which carries high upon it a large sculptored head-and-shoulders medalion of "William Friese-Greene" and his year of birth and death. There is a bronze statue of him at [[Pinewood Studios]].

In 2006 the [[BBC]] ran a series of programmes called ''The Lost World of Friese-Greene'', presented by [[Dan Cruickshank]] about Claude Friese-Greene's road trip from [[Land's End to John o' Groats]], ''The Open Road'', which he filmed from 1924 to 1926 using the Biocolour process. The original print of Claude's film was subjected to computer enhancement by the [[British Film Institute]] to remove the flickering problem.
