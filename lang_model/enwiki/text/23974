[[Image:DealorNoDealBanker.jpg|thumb|The show's mysterious Banker makes an offer to buy the contestant's chosen case.]]
The [[United States]] version of the gameshow '''''[[Deal or No Deal]]''''', hosted by [[Canada|Canadian]] actor-comedian [[Howie Mandel]], premiered on [[December 19]], [[2005]] on [[NBC]]. After an initial weeklong event and another in February 2006, the show aired multi-weekly from March to June of 2006, typically on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. In September 2006, the show returned with another weeklong event, and currently regularly airs on Monday and Wednesday nights; episodes have also aired at various times on Sundays, Thursdays and Fridays this season.

==Gameplay==
Before the game, a third party randomly places the possible winnings in the cases, which are distributed to 26 identically-dressed models who reveal the contents during the game. No one, including the host, models, or even the executive producers, knows what amounts are in the cases. Unlike many international versions of the show, the briefcases in the U.S. gallery are not distributed to audience members. 

After picking one of the cases, the contestant then selects 6 of the remaining 25 cases, revealed one at a time. Each figure appears in only one case, so any values revealed in this way are not in the contestant's case. This is followed by a "phone call" by "The Banker", a mysterious figure shown only in silhouette. He purportedly sits in a [[skybox]] (situated between the two audience sections) and makes an offer, via telephone, to Mandel (his voice is never heard) to buy the contestant's case based primarily on the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the cash amounts still in play, but also on the stage of the game (early offers tend to be far lower than the mean, perhaps to goad the contestant into continuing play) as well as the player's psychology (Mandel will also occasionally relay supposed insults from the Banker to the player; players often insult the Banker back). Mandel then asks the title question: "Deal or No Deal?"

If the contestant accepts the "Deal" (by pushing a stylized red button enclosed in a glass case), the game ends, and the value of the case that he or she chose at the beginning of the game is then revealed along with the whereabouts of the remaining prizes. Should the contestant refuse the offer (by stating "No deal" and/or closing the glass case), they must choose five of the remaining cases to eliminate from consideration. The Banker makes another offer, and play continues as before.  The Banker's offer may be higher or lower than the previous offer (if a top prize is eliminated, generally the offer decreases; conversely, if only lower amounts are eliminated the offer increases significantly). 

Subsequent rounds have the contestant withdrawing four, three, then two cases from play. Should the contestant continue to decline the Banker's offer after this point, they then eliminate one case each time (with an intervening offer from the Banker) until two cases are left. If the player rejects the final offer, they then have the opportunity to switch cases with the one remaining case before seeing their prize.

Each contestant has several supporters (usually three), who sit in a special section just off stage during his or her game. As the field of cases dwindles, one or more of the supporters are asked to consult with the contestant and help him/her make a decision. These exchanges have become emotional, particularly when very high and very small amounts remained and the Banker offers a large cash buyout; on at least one occasion, the contestant's daughters called, pleading (successfully) with her to take The Banker's deal. The contestant's supporters are typically revealed on the second Bank offer.

Often, the Banker may attach a prize to the cash in his offer. Most of the time, the prize is something the contestant wishes for (sometimes an unusual prize for gag purposes related to something the contestant likes); as on most gameshows, contestants fill out a screening sheet prior to their acceptance for broadcast, whose main purpose is to weed out unsuitable contestants, but also details their interests. If the offer is accepted, the contestant keeps the money and the prize, but if not, the prize will not be carried over to future offers.

==Lucky Case game==
[[Image:Luckycasegame.jpg|thumb|Lucky Case Game]]
During its first week on the air, there was a $10,000 home viewer giveaway, wherein home viewers were invited to send a text message stating what they thought was the "Lucky Case." Entries to the contest were also accepted via the NBC website. A correct answer placed that viewer in that night's drawing for the $10,000 prize. 

The Lucky Case game was altered for the 2nd week-long special, and the format carried over to the regular series. Instead of using the preexisting cases from the contestant's game, it uses a separate set of six gold-plated cases, as held by the show's models. Also, statistics are displayed before some commercial breaks showing the distribution of votes for each case. There are three different winners of the Lucky Case game each night -- one for the Eastern/Central time zone broadcast, and one each in the Mountain and Pacific time zones. Each time zone has its own separate winning case number.

The viewer's prize is usually $10,000; however, occasional special episodes offer an increased prize of up to $100,000 (or $20,000 in the first season).

On Global, they do not show the ''Lucky Case Game'' segment, as the Canadian viewers are not eligible to participate.

On Double Deal days, the Lucky Case game doubles, just like the case amounts, up to $20,000.

For the second week of shows, from [[February 27]], [[2006]], to [[March 3]], [[2006]], the top values (i.e., those above $100,000) increased from night to night as shown below; also, as something of a joke, the lowest value was increased on [[March 3]], [[2006]], to $.03. As a result of the increased potential payouts, the offers from the Banker increased while those higher values remained in play. Amounts did not increase for carryover contestants; the new values took effect for the first new contestant in each game. Higher amounts were also in play for the June 5 season finale, and those are also listed below.

Additionally, there was a game on [[November 17]], [[2006]] that had two contestants playing, rather than just one. Thus, for this game, all the money amounts on the game board were doubled, thus ranging from $ .02 to $2 million. The same was done on [[February 5]], [[2007]] and [[February 7]], [[2007]], except with one player each.

*First case ever chosen by a contestant: Case #14
*Cases most commonly selected by the contestant: Case #8 (12 times); Case #23 (8 times); Cases #3 and #17 (7 times each).
*All cases were selected at least once by a contestant.  Case #22 was the last case selected on January 22, 2007 when the cases where checkered.
*Cases rarely selected by the contestant: Case #1 - once; Case #10 - twice; Cases #19 & #22 - thrice.
*Amount most commonly in a contestant's case: $5 & $400,000 (7 times each)
*Huge amounts ($100,000 or higher) most commonly in a contestant's case: $400,000 (7 times) and $200,000 (6 times).
*Case most commonly holding the lowest prize (1 cent): Case #4 (11 times).
*Cases most commonly holding the top prize: Case #6 (7 times) 
*All the cases contained the top prize at least once. Case #4 was the last case to have the top prize that was revealed on November 17, 2006 after all 84 games played to that day. As of January 24, 2007, it has held it three times. However, Case #18 (which had the $6,000,000 prize at the end of premiere week and on [[February 5]],[[2007]] when she spoke fluent Italian to the contestant having the $2,000,000 in her case) has had it the least, with that amount being the second top prize she has held.
*Cases that have stayed in the gallery the longest on average: Cases #18 and 22 
*Cases that are eliminated from the gallery the quickest on average: Cases #5, #16 and #19 

The potential bank offer records were split, since it is impossible for bank offers to exceed $1,000,000 on the regular series.

*The first person to select a case with a huge amount ($100,000 or more) was Horston Bowen on March 20, 2006, who picked case number 3 with $400,000. (He did not win the case, however, he sold it for $221,000.)
*The first person to select the million dollar case was LaKissa Bright on April 26, 2006. (She did not win the case, #17, however, because she sold it for $215,000.)
*The first person to select the penny case was Eric Paulson on March 10, 2006. (He sold the case [#21] for $19,000.)
*As of November 9, 2006, only 4 contestants selected the top prize case, and 3 have picked it when $1 million was the top prize (the fourth being Matthew Sollena, who picked case 23 holding $3 million). However, none of them have won the prize.

To date:
*3 contestants selected the penny case, two of which have won over $100,000.
**In addition, on [[February 7]], [[2007]], Emika Porter, who played a Double Deal game (where all the money amounts were doubled), selected the case with $.02 (in case #22). She sold it for $15,000.
*2 contestants have gotten engaged on the show, and both of them won over $100,000. One of them won more than $300,000.
*6 contestants have picked the $1 million case for their first selection (twice in case #13, once in case #3, once in case #6, once in case #2, and once in case #1). One of them won $118,000, and one won $105,000, but the biggest win among the other four was $33,000.
*The earliest a bank offer has gone more than $100,000 (in regular gameplay only)  was the second offer which was offered to contestant Tony Kolton on [[February 18]], [[2007]] and was worth $153,000.
*The earliest a contestant accepted a deal was at the 4th offer on [[February 18]] [[2007]].  Tony Kolton accepted a deal worth  $94,000.

Early ratings for the show were extremely encouraging. <!-- In all five of its initial outings in December [[2005]], ''Deal or No Deal'' won its time slot in overall ratings and the 18-49 demographic, which advertisers deem a core demographic for television shows' success or failure. -->According to ''[http://www.zap2it.com Zap2it]'', "all five shows [during the week beginning [[December 19]], [[2005]] and ending [[December 25]], [[2005]]] finished in the top 15 among total viewers, peaking with 14.1 million people watching the Wednesday, [[December 21]] installment. For the week, "Deal or No Deal" averaged about 12.7 million viewers and a solid 4.3 rating in the adults 18-49."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1,1002,271%7C99324%7C1%7C,00.html|publisher=Zap2It|date=December 29, 2005|title=NBC Seals More 'Deal'|accessdate=2006-10-20}}</ref> 

The show appeared again on NBC each night [[February 27]] through [[March 3]] at 8:00PM EST with the top prize (and some of the higher-valued cases other than the top prize) escalating until the prize reached $3 million (and the lowest-valued case going up to $.03). As of [[March 6]], the show settled into regular time slots at 8:00PM EST Mondays and Fridays, with the top prize returning to its original $1 million. Wednesday episodes were added at 8:00PM EST due to the show's consistent ratings success. In something of a ratings coup, the [[April 3]] episode of the show, a two-hour special, outrated the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA basketball tournament final]] in head-to-head competition. During both of the two-hour specials, the second hour scored even higher ratings than the first.

Since it became a regular series, ''Deal or No Deal'' consistently placed within the 20 most popular programs on television, at times attaining the top 10.  The [[June 5]], [[2006]] 2-hour season finale, which featured [[Celine Dion]] via satellite, marked a series-high rating for the program, bringing in over 18 million viewers and a strong 5.5 share in the 18-49 demographic. The episode was easily the highest-rated show on any network for the week of June 5 through June 11, outdistancing the number-two show, a repeat episode of ''[[CSI:Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', by almost six million viewers. The finale experienced similar success in Canada, with 1.5 million viewers tuning in. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman/publish/article_5186.asp|title=Medialifemagazine.com|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=4120ffc2-60cb-43c8-b3a7-e4757328a81d&k=90240|title=Canada.com|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> (However, it should be noted that ''[[CSI:Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' and virtually all other fall TV series had completed their seasons two weeks earlier and were either in reruns or pre-empted by this point.)

===Season two (2006-2007)===

The show returned with new episodes in September 2006, airing on Mondays and Fridays at 8:00 and Thursdays at 9:00 <U+2014> the latter time slot being perhaps the most competitive in U.S. television, as ''Deal or No Deal'' faced a pair of big hit series in [[CBS]]'s ''[[CSI:Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]''.

''Deal'' 's Thursday time slot had initially been intended for ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' when NBC announced its fall schedule.  However, the need to protect the new series against stiff ratings competition  caused repurcussions throughout the network's primetime grid, including a move on May 25<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcumv.com/entertainment/release_detail.nbc/entertainment-20060525000000-nbcadjustsits2006.html|title=Nbcumv.com|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> of ''Deal'' from its announced Friday time slot to Thursdays. The drama ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', which had been planned for a mid-season run, was to be brought into the Friday lineup in what would have been ''Deal'' 's second weekly time slot. However, after ''Deal or No Deal'' completed airing special episodes in that time slot to success, [[NBC]] moved ''Crossing Jordan'' back to midseason and used ''Deal'' on Fridays as well to help launch a sister series, ''[[1 vs. 100 (US game show)|1 vs. 100]]''.

The show premiered with a 2-hour edition on [[September 18]], [[2006]], and one-hour episodes that each aired on September 19, 21 and 22. The show used a $20 million prize pot over the first week to kick off the second season of the game, coupled with the at-home ''Lucky Case Game'' for $1 million. During the season premiere week in 2006, the main game had maximum amounts start at $1 million, and increased $1 million for each game, up to $6 million. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6355336.html|title=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref>, <ref name=futon />

According to final Nielsen ratings for the week of September 18-24, 2006, the second-season premiere episode of ''Deal or No Deal'' on Monday, September 18 was the 11th most-watched network prime time show in total audience and NBC's most-watched program in total audience. The Friday episode of the show also did well in the ratings and won its time slot against the other networks. The Tuesday and Thursday episodes suffered from tough competition: ''[[Dancing with the Stars (US TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''Grey's Anatomy'' and ''CSI''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgenes.biz/rec.arts.tv/thread1256.html|title=Royalgenes.com|accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref>

The success of ''Deal or No Deal'' was a factor in NBC's decision to program another [[Endemol]] game, ''[[1 vs. 100]]'', which premiered on October 13 and assumed ''Deal'''s Friday night time slot on October 27. Meanwhile, NBC announced the Thursday episodes would end with the November 8 episode, to be replaced by sitcoms ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' and ''[[30 Rock]]''. Through all these changes, the Monday night edition of ''Deal'' continued to win its timeslot by a large margin. On Monday, October 30, 2006, for instance, ''Deal'' won its time slot with a 10.3 household rating and 16 percent share, easily outdistancing second-place ''[[Prison Break]]'' at 5.6/8.  Interestingly, during the November sweeps period, the ratings for ''Deal or No Deal'' on Thursday grew slightly despite heavy competition in the timeslot.  [[NBC]] moved the second weekly episode of ''Deal or No Deal'' to Wednesday at 9 PM as of January 2007, and also added a few episodes at 7:00 PM Sundays in hopes of giving a boost to its new post-[[American football|football]] lineup.  NBC announced on [[February 16]], [[2007]] that the second airing would move from Wednesdays to Sundays at 9 PM (Eastern/Pacific) starting [[March 4]].

===Cable===

NBC's sister business network, [[CNBC]], aired episodes of the premiere week of ''Deal or No Deal'' starting on [[December 26]], [[2005]], scoring above-average ratings for the network. The show has been blacked out in Canada on that station due to programming rights issues in that country, and Canadian viewers were shown [[CNBC World]] programming instead.  The show began to rerun again on CNBC during the week of February 6 until June 9th.  CNBC also programmed the second week-long series of the show but the sequence started two shows behind the airings on NBC (i.e., while the March 1 edition of the show on NBC aired with the top prize augmented to $2 million, the first airing on CNBC started with the first show at its baseline $1 million).

For the show's second season, following a marathon of the second season premiere week, CNBC announced that ''Deal or No Deal'' re-airings would be back on Saturday nights starting [[October 14]], 2006, at 8 p.m., 11 p.m., and 3 a.m. EST. In addition, ''Deal'' reruns aired on CNBC every Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., 11 p.m., and 1 a.m. EST.  Currently, the reruns air Tuesday and Thursday nights at 9:00 p.m. EST and Saturday nights at 8:00 p.m. EST and 11:00 p.m. EST.

[[TVtropolis]] also airs episodes, starting with the February premiere week of eps.

==Models==
{{main|List of Deal or No Deal models (US)}}

While most of the models hold the same numbered case each week, a few of the models hold a different case number each game.  All 26 models wear identical dresses and shoes, though the style is changed for each episode.

[[Image:DealorNoDealModels.jpg|thumb|The 26 models walk into the stage holding their briefcases.]]
[[Image:HowieandtheDealorNoDealModels.jpg|thumb|Host Howie Mandel stands in front of the models.]]

==Odds and probabilities==
When a contestant is presented with the original 26 cases, he or she has a 3.85% (1 in 26) chance of selecting a case containing any of the available dollar amounts. (Compare this to the standard American [[roulette]] wheel, where selecting any of the available 38 numbers offers [[casino]] players just 2.63% (1 in 38) of selecting a winning number.) 

If the contestant were allowed to open this case immediately, theoretically it would contain $750 or less half the time (13 of 26 cases) and $1,000 or more half the time (13 of 26 cases); the [[median]] ("middle") case value is $875. However, because of the very large top prizes, the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] ("average") value of that case is $131,477.54. If every contestant refused every deal (eventually being able to open their initial choice), the gameshow would [[expected value|expect]] to pay out approximately $131,131 per contestant on average. However, most of the gameshow's payouts would be concentrated in a few big winners -- and most contestants would leave with very disappointing earnings. 

*Once the contestant has revealed six cases, he or she has a 5% (1 in 20) chance of the case containing any of the remaining available amounts.  The mean and median expected contents of the initial case change accordingly. 
*After the contestant has revealed five more cases, he or she has a 6.67% (1 in 15) chance of the case containing any of the remaining available amounts.
*After the contestant has revealed four more cases, he or she has a 9.1% (1 in 11) chance of the case containing any of the remaining available amounts.
*After the contestant has revealed three more cases, he or she has a 12.5% (1 in 8) chance of the case containing any of the remaining available amounts.
*After the contestant has revealed two more cases, he or she has a 16.7% (1 in 6) chance of the case containing any of the remaining available amounts.
*The contestant's odds of his or her selected case containing a specific value will continue to increase (20% &ndash; 1 in 5; 25% &ndash; 1 in 4; 33% &ndash; 1 in 3) until just two cases (the first selected case and the last case held by a model) remain. At this point, the odds of winning either amount is 50% (1 in 2), regardless of whether the player switches the cases or not.  A common misconception is that switching cases increases a contestant's chance of winning.  However, the [[Monty Hall problem]] does not apply in this case, because the contestant, with no knowledge of the contents of the cases, can potentially eliminate a top prize at any time.  The only way to increase odds of winning past 50% by swapping would be for someone with knowledge of the cases' contents to choose cases after the contestant's initial choice, leaving behind one winning amount and one lesser amount.

==Special versions derived from the US version==

* A syndicated version is currently being planned, which may debut in the Fall of 2007. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/?p=511|title=Buzzerblog.com|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref> It is known, however, that Howie Mandel will not host the syndicated version, as the asking price to host it, in addition to the primetime NBC version, is out of the producers' league. Also, the syndicators announced that [[Arsenio Hall]], who hosted the pilot, will not be hosting the syndicated version. The producers have yet to find a host, though it is rumored that comedian [[Mark Curry (actor)|Mark Curry]] and [[Street Smarts (game show)|Street Smarts]] host [[Frank Nicotero]] are among the candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6396751.html?display=Breaking+News|title=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref> However, the future of the syndicated version may be in doubt, as the NBC network is concerned the show would burn out prematurely, just like ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]''. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6406608.html?display=Breaking+News|title=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref> A 2008 debut, however, is a possibility. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcast.broadcastnewsroom.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=96630|title=Broadcast Newsroom|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>

* NBC and [[Endemol]] have produced a Spanish-language version of ''Deal or No Deal'', which debuted October 8, 2006, on their [[Telemundo]] Spanish language channel. Titled ''[[Vas o No Vas (US game show)|Vas o No Vas]] (Go or No Go)'', it is hosted by [[H<U+00E9>ctor Sandarti]], who hosted the Mexican version of the same name for [[Televisa]].  The top prize is $250,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/ent_radio/story/418310p-353309c.html|title=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref> The show is televised on Sunday nights at 9:30 PM ET/PT.  The episodes that aired on [[November 5]], and [[December 17]], 2006, saw contestants win $180,500 and a Ford F-150 for a total of over $200,000, an all-time record for an American-based Spanish-language game show.

*After the conclusion of [[Super Bowl XLI]] on [[February 4]], [[2007]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] in Canada debuted ''[[Deal or No Deal Canada]]'', a special Canadian version of ''Deal or No Deal''. This version of the show, taped January 23-25, 2007 in [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]], features Howie Mandel (a Toronto native) as host. The series is slated for five hour-long episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=fe168ca7-8b94-45ea-a76a-9b487f1690ef&k=78245|title=Canada.com|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref> Applications for auditioning were very similar to the NBC version, except that no videos are required.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/dondcasting/index.html|title=Canada.com|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>

* Also in Canada, [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] has produced a French-Canadian version of ''Deal or No Deal'' called ''[[Le Banquier]]'', named after the mysterious figure that contestants must make deals with to obtain as much money as possible. The show, which is practically the same as the US version, have 26 cases with a $500,000 top prize. The only difference is that the models  on the top row (cases 21 to 26) are men.

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
{{not verified}}
* The original pilot was produced for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in early 2004 with British TV personality [[Patrick Kielty]] as host and a $2.5 million top prize.  It was announced that the show would premiere in March 2004, but ABC decided against airing the series.

*The show was taped during its first season at [[Sunset-Gower Studios]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]; however, early episodes were taped at [[CBS Television City]] in [[Hollywood]].  The second season is being taped at [[The Culver Studios]].

* During the first week, once a contestant accepts the deal, the game was played through to determine potential future bank offers, still phoned in as usual. Starting on the second week, the potential offers are displayed immediately, without any significant interaction from the Banker, making the post-deal play-through much quicker. Also, the potential offers are generally not displayed if they would be significantly less than the offer that was accepted, and the rest of the play-through is not shown once it is assumed that the player made a good deal. Whether or not it actually occurs and is edited is unknown. Bad deals (or what may turn out to be one), however, are usually played out in their entirety.  (In other international versions, games are played in their entirety for the losing contestants in the question round to learn their amounts for the purpose of trying for the lucky guess prize.  There is no such rule in the current US version, but there are rules have go into the Spanish-language US version (see below), but has not been decided to be in the upcoming syndicated version.)

* During play in the second week-long special, a contestant accidentally knocked the phone onto the floor, breaking off the battery cover. Mandel joked about it and went to commercial break; when the show resumed, the phone was fixed with a rather unnecessary amount of black tape (On the March 31, 2006 episode, a contestant broke the box that covers the deal button, bringing the black tape back to the show.  A subsequent deal was a humorous $148,990, with $10 subtracted from the regular deal to account for the broken box.) The phone was also knocked off onto the floor as well by contestant Kate Miller during the February 14, 2007 episode.

*A commercial for the second week-long special illustrated a first-person simulation of what it's like to be a contestant on ''Deal or No Deal''. Scenes included the scoreboard, the models, the family members in the audience, and Howie Mandel. However, the commercial contained some continuity errors. For instance, the scoreboard showed that a number of cases had been opened already, but all 26 models were still on stage. Also, the bank offer shown was too large for the amounts of money left in play.

*For the first 13 episodes, [[Peter Abbay]] played the role of the mysterious banker. Presumably, he still does, but he is no longer in the end credits.

*The show's announcer is [[Joe Cipriano]]. He also is the regular voice-over at many television networks, and including other Endemol productions.  (In many game shows, announcers are by production company, not networks, as historically networks were not permitted to have control over game shows.)

* Originally, Mandel opted not to host ''Deal or No Deal'', and turned down the job more than once, but his wife Terry talked him into hosting the show.

* [[Leyla Milani]], the model behind case #13, is a friend of [[Howie Mandel]]'s.  They both grew up in the same [[North York]], [[Ontario]] neighborhood and went to the same high school, albeit over 25 years apart.

* A "Deal or No Deal" electronic game was released in June. This game was revealed on the April 24 episode, where the contestant and each member of the audience received a copy.  A DVD game is also available. [http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4961000]

* On [[April 4]], [[2006]], the syndicated TV newsmagazine ''[[Inside Edition]]'' did a behind-the-scenes report on ''Deal'' 's models. The report, done by the show's reporter [[Jim Moret]], showed how the models were all becoming glamourous at the same time, using hair and make-up, and putting on the emerald green dresses they had trouble squeezing into. Another syndicated newsmagazine, ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', profiled ''Deal'''s models on [[May 4]], [[2006]], and during the month of May, each of the models co-hosted ''[[Extra (television show)|Extra]]'' 's "Deal of the Day" segment with ''Extra'' co-host [[Mark McGrath]].

*All the models on ''Deal'' were named as one of [[People Magazine]]'s  100 Most Beautiful People on [[April 26]], [[2006]].

*[[Bonnie-Jill Laflin]] appeared as a model during the show's first week, but did not return for the February tapings; instead, she opted to join other entertainers visiting troops in [[Iraq]].  Laflin has not been on the show since.

* Mandel appeared at the [[58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]] at the [[Shrine Auditorium]], presenting the award for Outstanding Directing in a Musical, Comedy, or Variety Program. Six of the models were brought onstage to symbolize the nominees, with one model's case containing a monitor showing the winner ([[Louis J. Horvitz]] for his directing work on the 2006 [[Academy Awards]]; Horvitz also was the Emmys' director that night). Earlier that night, during [[Conan O'Brien]]'s montage song of "Gee, We're Screwed" (to make fun of NBC's bad ratings luck in recent seasons), he made reference to Deal or No Deal by singing that NBC is now "depending on Howie Mandel" to humorously describe how "desperate" NBC has become to get ratings.

* In the second season's premiere episode, the models walked out on stage before each new game was played. Usually, the models would have already been in place if a new game started during an episode.

*In the second season the Banker now has a couple of models who have made appearances. In the $3,000,000 episode, two "Banker Babes" offered $400,000 in cash; on the October 5th episode, the Banker model showed up with "the elusive case 27" or "the Banker's case"; when she opened case 27, the offer was revealed via red LED lights, with the same effects as a regular round; on the November 13th episode, the Banker Babe came out with a case full of donuts for a cop contestant (to add to the offer of $136,000).

*Usually the models that hold the Lucky Cases change each episode, but often there are regulars. In Season 1, the model lineup was fairly regular with [[Lisa Gleave]], [[Tameka Jacobs]], [[Lindsay Clubine]], [[Mylinda Tov]], [[Claudia Jordan]] and [[Jill Manas]] along with others. In Season 2, the model lineup has varied, with appearances by [[Hayley Marie Norman]], [[Anya Monzikova]], [[Kasie Head]], [[Sara Bronson]], [[Leyla Milani]], [[Marisa Petroro]], [[Pilar Lastra]], [[Brooke Long]], [[Alike Boggan]], [[Laura Shields]], [[Lauren Shiohama]], and [[Aubrie Lemon]], [[Keltie Martin]], [[Tameka Jacobs]], [[Heather LaCombe]], [[Jenelle Borwnyn Moreno]], [[Lindsay Schoneweis]], [[Lisa Gleave]], [[Claudia Jordan]], [[Kelly Brannigan]], and [[Meghan Markle]].

*On the 2006 [[Thanksgiving]] two-hour special, the second game had the $25 amount on the board replaced by a [[domesticated turkey|turkey]]. In the third game, the $10 amount was replaced with [[pumpkin pie]].
**In that same episode, the third game also had a special green bonus case, held by [[Keltie Martin]], in which the contestant would win if the $1 million was kept in play after the first two rounds. Alas, in the first round, the $1 million was picked off, in Keltie's most substituted case, [[Brooke Long]]'s, case #15. The amount inside the case was never revealed.
**Also in that episode, the ''Lucky Case Game'' had a person dressed up as a turkey holding case number 6, while the other models looked at it weirdly.

* A special two-hour [[Christmas]] themed episode was seen following the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]-[[Dallas Cowboys]] game on [[December 25]], [[2006]] (except on the West coast, where it aired at 8 PM PST). Audience members won prizes: in the first game, two audience members won a prize if the gift boxes included a card that said "Deal", and everyone in the audience won a prize from the Banker &mdash; a penny (because the penny was among the 5 cases still remaining in the game). In the second game, all audience members won a small prize if the contestant said "No Deal", though they also kept the last prize when the contestant accepted the deal. Some of the models also announced what they wanted for Christmas. Lindsay Clubine wanted a trip to a white sandy beach, Lauren Shiohama wanted a house, and Keltie Martin wanted a little dog to carry around with her. In the Eastern and Central Time Zones (at least), the winner of the Lucky Case Game, normally announced during the show's closing credits, was announced at the end of ''[[1 vs. 100 (US game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', which followed ''Deal or No Deal'' that night.  Some of the singers in this episode were the 'Mob Members' for that episode of 1 vs. 100.

*A special episode aired at 7 PM ET/PT January 7 prior to the premiere of ''[[Grease: You're The One That I Want]]'', with the models wearing 1950's attire, complete with [[poodle skirt]]s and [[saddle shoes]]. During the show the original star of the ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' movie, [[Olivia Newton-John]], called in.
**This episode also featured a "Double or Nothing" option, based on the [[Deal or No Deal (Australian game show)|Australian version]]. However, unlike the Aussie version (where the contestant would risk any portion of his or her winnings), the contestant would have to wager everything if s/he decided to play. The contestant "Kathy" chose not to play, but the case she chose, had she decided to play, would have doubled her winnings. It is currently unknown if this will be a permanent feature; it was also present on the [[January 21]] episode with the contestant taking the $1,000 won in the game. If she had chosen one of the two cases, however, she would've lost her winnings.

*The pop group [[Hanson]] appeared on the [[January 24]], 2007 episode to surprise contestant Jackie Monroe, who is a huge fan of the group.
**Coming from [[Evansville, Indiana]], Monroe was the first news anchor to be a DoND contestant -- she anchors the weekday prime-time newscasts on [[FOX]] affiliate [[WTVW]].

*Retired NBA superstar [[Magic Johnson]] made a guest appearance in the episode that aired on [[February 5]], [[2007]]. That same episode, [[Flavio Insinna]], the host of [[Italy]]'s version of the show (called ''[[Affari Tuoi]]'' there) appeared via satellite from the Italian version's set.

* The highest Deal or No Deal first offer ever was $50,000, happening on [[February 7]], [[2007]].  This offer may have been such an enormous sum only due to the fact that, on this particular episode, all the dollar values were doubled. But on [[February 18]], [[2007]], contestant Tony Kolton's first offer of $80,000 became the highest first offer ever in the regular game of Deal or No Deal. His second offer was also the highest ever, it being $153,000. His third offer is possibly the highest third offer ever, $169,000.

* Bobby, Howie Mandel's cartoon character from his 1990s [[FOX]] animated series, ''[[Bobby's World]]'', appeared on the [[February 12]], [[2007]] episode, to ask contestant Donato DeMarinis the magic question: "Deal or No Deal?"
** Also in that same game, DeMarinis was surprised with a live [[telecast]] from [[Times Square]] where his family and former contestants Gary Riotto, Michele Falco, and Matty Sollena offered Donato advice during a [[patriotic]] episode.

* On the [[February 18]], [[2007]] episode, contestant Tony Kolton took the deal offered $94,000 on only the 4th offer offered which is the shortest time that a deal has been taken.

==Quotes==

In addition to the titular question:
*"''Ladies, please.''" - Cue for the models to enter the stage.
*"''Hi ladies.''" -- [in unison] "''Hi Howie!''" - a short exchange between Howie and the models when they come out. It is usually followed by a humorous remark by Howie. This exchange is similar to the exchange from ''Charlie's Angels'' where Charlie greets the Angels by saying "Good Morning, Angels!" and the Angels responding in unison with "Good Morning, Charlie!"
*"''How do we find out what's in your case? We'll start by opening those. Whatever's in there is not in your case.''" - Howie starts each game with this spiel.
*"[Model's first name] , ''open the case.''" - Cue for the chosen model to open the case, with an accompaning hand gesture.
*"''...And the bank offer would've been...''" - Used after a deal has been accepted to show what any future offers would be.
*"''You made... a great deal!''" - To any contestant who took an offer for more than their case amount, even if it wasn't necessarily the best offer in the game.
*"''You made... not such a great deal.''" - To any contestant who took an offer for less than their case amount.

Other terminology used in the game:

*''Safety net'' - Used when two relatively close, high dollar cases are isolated; breaking it usually results in a dangerous board.
*''Landmine'' - Used when the gap between the highest and second highest value is very large; if the largest value is exposed, the player is said to have "hit a landmine".
*''Razor's edge'' - Somewhat related to a landmine; if a player chooses to play on with only one amount worth winning left in play, they are on the "razor's edge".
*''Player's board'' - It's usage is not particularly clear, but this is usually used when the player has several high value cases at a relatively late point in the game.
*''Banker's board'' - The opposite of "player's board", in which there are more low cases than high late in the game.

==Parodies==

*The [[April 8]], [[2006]] episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ran a spoof of ''Deal or No Deal'', in which [[Fred Armisen]] played Mandel, and the week's guest host [[Antonio Banderas]] plays the contestant, who doesn't quite understand the rules of the game, with his family members (played by [[Horatio Sanz]], [[Rachel Dratch]], and [[Finesse Mitchell]]) using incorrect catch-phrases from other game shows. A video of this clip can be seen on NBC's site. [http://www.nbc.com/Video/videos/snl_1444_dond.shtml Link]

* The [[September 30]] [[2006]] episode of [[MADtv]] had a parody of ''Deal or No Deal'' with [[Michael McDonald]] as Howie Mandel and [[Jordan Peele]] and [[Keegan-Michael Key]] playing their trademark characters Ty and Carl (known as the Superstitious Knights) who had a "million or bust" attitude while doing a "man up" (ritualized dance) for luck.

* On [[Saturday]], [[October 28]], 2006, [[Lester Holt]], host of the weekend edition of NBC's [[Today Show]], dressed as Howie Mandel for [[Halloween]]. In addition, Holt introduced a bevy of women descending a staircase dressed as the ''Deal or No Deal'' models with the traditional introduction ("Ladies, please...").

* The [[November 26]] [[2006]] episode of ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]'' featured Howie Mandel as the [[guest host]] of the "show within a show".  Mandel's opening [[monologue]] was interrupted with a ''Deal or No Deal'' spoof that included an absurdly long wait for the banker to suggest a deal amount.

==Imitations==

* 96.5 FM [[WPOW-FM]] in [[Miami, Florida]] has their own version, ''Deal Or Not?''; contestants call in with two choices out of three cases to pick (at first, just one pick out of two). This version uses no banker.

* Beginning October 16, 2006, ''[[Tom Joyner|The Tom Joyner Morning Show]]'', a syndicated morning radio program, offers a "Cash Call" contestant a chance to gamble $1000 for a chance to win $1 million, in a game similar to ''Deal Or No Deal''. In this game, the caller picks one out of 26 envelopes, with the contestant winning whatever's inside. This version also uses no banker.

* 103.7 FM [[WRTS]]-FM in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] also has their own version, ''Meal or No Meal'', where contestants call and select one of 10 cases that contain gift cards for local restaurants. If someone picked and didn't like their choice, they could pick again for something else, or possibly get nothing.

* During halftime at [[Western Kentucky University]] basketball games, their own version of ''Meal or No Meal'' is played by a selected fan in the crowd. Sponsored by [[Wendy's]], the player must pick between four different colored briefcases having: 1, 5, 15, or 52 combo meals in them.  After the briefcase is selected, they ask to check to see one of the cases, and then an offer is made.  Then, like the real game, they decide if they will take it or not.  Then, they find out how many combos they won.

* On WSIN 1590 AM Radio, the station at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], a student hosts [[SCSU's The Deal]], otherwise known as "SCSU's Deal or No Deal", in which game play is similar to that of the UK version, where there are 22 envelopes and 22 different amounts ranging from $.01 to $25. With Season 2 beginning in January 2007, the top prize is expected to increase to $50. This version does have a banker.

* During the summer of 2006, 99.5 [[WZPL]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana featured a game titled "Gas or No Gas", in which contestants played for varying gallons of gas with the maximum amount as high as 100 gallons.

* [[CHSU-FM]] 99.9 in [[Kelowna, British Columbia]] created a radio version of the game where contestants could win one of six cases amounted from $1 to $500.
