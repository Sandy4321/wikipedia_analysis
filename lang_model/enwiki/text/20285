'''Prince Micha<U+0142> Serwacy Wi<U+015B>niowiecki''' (1680&ndash;1744) was a [[Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth|Polish]] [[szlachcic|nobleman]], magnate, politician, diplomat, general, a successful military commander and the last male representative of the [[Wi<U+015B>niowiecki family]].<ref>http://katalog.muzeum.krakow.pl/pl/work/MNK-III-ryc-5746-Micha%C5%82-Serwacy-Wi%C5%9Bniowiecki-1680-1744-</ref>

During [[Civil war in Lithuania (1700)|Civil war in Lithuania]] in 1700 Wi<U+015B>niowiecki was the leader of the opposition against [[Sapieha|Sapieha clan]] and defeated them in the [[battle of Olkieniki]], turning their [[Ruzhany Palace]] to ashes. Supporter of [[Augustus II the Strong]] till 1707, when came on the side of [[Stanis<U+0142>aw I Leszczy<U+0144>ski]]. In the same year imprisoned by the Russians, since 1709 was on exile. In 1716, when accepted rule of Augustus II the Strong, returned to the country. In 1733 he supported the Russian intervention and forced election of [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]].<ref>http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/6032,,,,wisniowiecki_michal_serwacy,haslo.html</ref>

Wi<U+015B>niowiecki was one of the wealthiest magnates in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and his burial ceremony in [[Vyshnivets|Wi<U+015B>niowiec]] is considered as the most lavish of the 18th century in [[Poland]].

==Early life and family==
Because Wi<U+015B>niowiecki's biological father died young, he and his older brother were raised by their stepfather, Jan Karol Dolski. Micha<U+0142> studied at the Jesuit college in [[Lw<U+00F3>w]], where he graduated in 1695. At the same time, his stepfather died and Wi<U+015B>niowiecki's mother, desiring to keep the property and the wealth of her deceased husband, quickly arranged marriage of his daughter Catherine with Micha<U+0142>, although he was just 15 years old. The wedding took place without any publicity, in order to silence the protests of Catherine's family, who would confiscate her rightful estates and the money. Shortly after the wedding he left his wife in Poland and went on a trip abroad, during which he spent a year in the military academy in [[Paris]]. From abroad he returned in 1697 to take part in the new election of a king, during which he supported the candidacy of the [[Wettin]] family member and Elector of Saxony, [[Augustus II the Strong]]. At the same time, a conflict erupted between Micha<U+0142> and his mother about the former wealth of his stepfather. In this case the possession conflict also concerned his wife. Eventually, Micha<U+0142> and his brother inherited the fortune that Dolski left, however, this greatly and negatively influenced the relationship with his mother. 

==Political and military career==
Wi<U+015B>niowiecki's proper political career began on the eve of the [[Civil war in Lithuania (1700)|Lithuanian Civil War]] in 1700, when he was the leader of the opposition against [[Sapieha|Sapieha family clan]] and defeated them in the [[battle of Olkieniki]], turning their [[Ruzhany Palace]] to ashes. After becoming Speaker of the Parliament in [[Lublin]], in 1703, the [[Sejm|noble Diet]] appointed him Lithuanian Field [[Hetman]], [[Castellan]] of [[Vilnius]] and eventually he gained the title of the [[Great Hetman of Lithuania]]. Throughout the civil war period in the early eighteenth century, Wi<U+015B>niowiecki was a supporter of Augustus II, and only few months after Augustus' abdication in 1707, he switched sides only to favour the new king [[Stanis<U+0142>aw I Leszczy<U+0144>ski]]. Moreover, Micha<U+0142> was forced to give back the title of a Hetman and the [[Wilno Voivodeship|province of Vilnius]]. After the defeat of the Swedish army at the [[Battle of Poltava]] that Wi<U+015B>niowiecki aided and supported, he was forced (from the Russian side) to give up his family and possessions. After his refusal on September 8, 1709 he was immediately imprisoned by the Russian Imperial Army. Despite the intercession of many people, including king Augustus II himself, who then returned to Poland, Tsar [[Peter the Great]] was not going to release the prince, whom he considered a traitor and a liar. Only after a year Micha<U+0142> managed ot escape, but for a long time he was not able to return to the country where the Russian troops remained and stationed, especially in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

After several years of trying to restore the [[Leszczy<U+0144>ski family]] on the Polish throne, and after heavy negotiations with Augustus, in spring of 1716 Wi<U+015B>niowiecki returned to Poland, but the prince could not count on retaining his former titles and posts as these were already occupied by strong supporters and loyal friends of the king. It was only in 1720 that the post of [[Chancellor of Lithuania]] became vacant and after some hesitation, the king allowed Micha<U+0142> to become the Chancellor. Also during this time he was awarded the [[Order of the White Eagle]]. After the death of the Great Lithuanian Hetman Ludwik Pociej (1730), Prince Micha<U+0142> renewed his efforts to recover the title of a Hetman. But the king refused to trust him and Wi<U+015B>niowiecki only received the position of commander-General (''Regimentarz'') in practice, however - in the absence of the Hetman - the monarch granted him full authority and command over the military of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]<ref>http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/6032,,,,wisniowiecki_michal_serwacy,haslo.html</ref>. After the death of Tsar Peter I, Wi<U+015B>niowiecki improved his relations with Russia and, therefore, in the course of the 1733 election he supported the election of [[Augustus III]]. As one of the few magnates he took part in the coronation of the king in the [[Wawel Cathedral]] in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] and, ironically, later fought against the supporters of Stanis<U+0142>aw Leszczy<U+0144>ski, although he himself preferred not to be involved in this conflict. In return for his services to the new king, in 1735 Micha<U+0142> fully regained the title of a Hetman. He also received numerous counties, towns, villages and towards the end of his life Wi<U+015B>niowiecki has become one of the strongest magnates in the Grand Duchy and the Eastern parts of the Commonwealth. 

He died on September 16, 1744 in the town of [[Merecz]]. His third wife, [[Tekla R<U+00F3><U+017C>a Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] organized an extravagant and lavish funeral that lasted nearly three days. During the ceremony, the guards presented the mourners and the audience with 12 portraits of his ancestors and a ceremonial breaking of the shield was conducted as a sign of extinction of the noble family.
