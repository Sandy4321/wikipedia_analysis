'''Eddy''' is one of three fictional main characters in the [[animated series|animated television]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]''. He first appeared in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy''{{'}}s pilot episode "[[The Ed-Touchables]]" which premiered on January 4, 1999 in the United States, though it was originally planned to air in November 1998. Eddy was created and designed by [[cartoonist]] [[Danny Antonucci]], who based him on different aspects of his own personality.

Eddy is best friends with [[Ed (Ed, Edd n Eddy)|Ed]] and Edd (Double D), the other two main characters of the series. He lives in the fictional town of Peach Creek and attends Peach Creek Junior High School. He is the self-appointed leader of the Eds and is known as a greedy, ill-tempered, extremly selfish con artist and loudmouth who goes to great lengths to scam the cul-de-sac children out of their money in order to purchase [[Gobstopper|jawbreakers]], even at the expense of his friends' credibility. He often brags about his big brother, who went unseen until the series' [[TV film|TV movie]] finale. He has also made a number of appearances in other media and in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' merchandising lines.

The characters of ''Ed, Edd, and Eddy'' were popular amongst children as well as adults. In 2002, Eddy, along with Ed and Edd, won the [[The 1st 13th Annual Fancy Anvil Awards Show Program Special: Live in Stereo|Fancy Anvil Award]] for Best Team. Eddy made his final appearance in the series TV movie finale ''[[List of Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes#Film|Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show]]'', which aired on November 8, 2009.

==Role in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy''==
Eddy is one of the three Eds, the other two being Ed and Edd (better known as Double D) with whom he is best friends. They live in the fictional city of Peach Creek on Rethink Avenue, referred to as simply the [[cul-de-sac]] and attend Peach Creek Junior High. In seasons 1<U+2013>4, Eddy wears a yellow bowling shirt with a horizontal red stripe and purple collar, red shoes and light blue jeans with a wallet chain hanging from his left pocket. In seasons 5<U+2013>6 and in the special episodes "[[Ed, Edd n Eddy (specials)|Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle]]" and "[[Ed, Edd n Eddy (specials)|The Eds are Coming, the Eds are Coming]]", he wears a jacket that resembles his original shirt closely. However, in ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show]]'', Eddy wears his original shirt. He is short and mostly bald, with only three long hairs on his head. It has been revealed that his middle name is Skipper.<ref name=Skipper>{{Cite episode |title=Your Ed Here |series=[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]] |network=[[Cartoon Network]] |date=January 23, 2004 |season=4}}</ref> His report card describes him as a [[megalomania]]c.

Eddy is the unofficial leader of the Eds, coming up with plans to scam the other cul-de-sac children (usually charging a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]) in order to purchase their favourite confectionery; [[Gobstopper|jawbreakers]]. However, their scams usually fail, either by being destroyed, unpopular, abandoned or resulting in the cul-de-sac children asking for refunds. Though he comes up with the scams by himself, he does not participate in the construction, meaning Edd and Ed must build by themselves, though Ed often accidentally destroys them.

==Creation==
[[Cartoonist]] [[Danny Antonucci]] spent months designing the show in a way similar to the classic cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s.<ref name=Season1DVD>{{cite video| people =[[Danny Antonucci]]| year = October 10, 2006| title = Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season<U+2014>''Interview with the Creator''| time = 0:22<U+2013>2:34 | format = DVD| publisher = [[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref> While the cul-de-sac children were based on real people in his life,<ref name=Season1DVD/> the personalities of Eddy and the two Eds were based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons.<ref name=Season1DVD/> He described Eddy as a "loud mouth, scammer, trying to make a buck every two seconds,"<ref name=BestDayEdder>{{cite episode|title=The Best Day Edder |series=Ed, Edd n Eddy |network=Cartoon Network |date=April 27<U+2013>28, 2007}}</ref> and that he new right away that he would cast [[Tony Sampson]] as Eddy.<ref name=Season1DVD/>

==Personality==
Eddy is extremely selfish and cares about no one but himself. He spends an extensive amount of time working on his own interests and tries his hardest to earn more money. Most likely due to his personality, he is not treated well and serves as a [[outcast (person)|social outcast]]. He is the most despised out of the three Eds and is bitter rivals with Kevin. Eddy is extremely narcissistic, and is often admires himself in mirrors and compliments on how "good looking" he is. He is extremely greedy and constantly tries to earn money with scams in order to buy [[Gobstopper|jawbreakers]], to the point that he even sacrifices his friends for money or jawbreakers, though he does truly care for his two best friends.

All of Eddy's traits come from his older brother (referred to as "Eddy's Brother," or "Big Bro" by Eddy), who used to set up scams like Eddy, although it is known that he was very successful and popular. Eddy sees his brother as a role model and tries to become popular like him, but has failed multiple times, which is one of the reasons why he does not fit in. However, it is revealed in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show'' that Eddy is just sad and misunderstood, living in the shadow of his older brother, and that everything about his brother were lies he made up to "look cool," and regrets all of the scams and mistakes he made.<ref name=FilmBPS>{{cite video| date = November 8, 2009| title = Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show| publisher = [[Cartoon Network]]
