'''HMCS ''Woodstock''''' was a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] revised {{sclass2|Flower|corvette}} that took part in convoy escort duties during the [[Second World War]]. She fought primarily in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. She was named for [[Woodstock, Ontario]].

==Background==
{{main|Flower class corvette}}
Flower-class corvettes like ''Woodstock'' serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ossian |first=Robert |url=http://www.thepirateking.com/ships/ship_types.htm |title=Complete List of Sailing Vessels |website=The Pirate King |accessdate=13 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Fitzsimons |editor-first=Bernard |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons & Warfare |location=London |publisher=Phoebus |date=1978 |volume=11 |pages=1137<U+2013>1142 |isbn=}}</ref><ref name=Jane>{{cite book |title=Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II |location=New Jersey |publisher=Random House |date=1996 |isbn=0-517-67963-9 |page=68}}</ref> The "corvette" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blake |first=Nicholas |last2=Lawrence |first2=Richard |title=The Illustrated Companion to Nelson's Navy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I59v6rkg8egC&pg=PA39 |publisher=Stackpole Books |date=2005 |pages=39<U+2013>63 |isbn=0-8117-3275-4}}</ref> During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, [[Winston Churchill]] reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a [[whaling ship]] design.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chesneau |first=Roger |last2=Gardiner |first2=Robert |title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships (1922<U+2013>1946) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bJBMBvyQ83EC&pg=PA62 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date=June 1980 |page=62 |isbn=0-87021-913-8}}</ref> The generic name "flower" was used to designate the class of these ships, which <U+2013> in the Royal Navy <U+2013> were named after flowering plants.<ref name=Milner>{{cite book |title=North Atlantic Run |last=Milner |first=Marc |publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1985 |pages=117<U+2013>119, 142<U+2013>145, 158, 175<U+2013>176, 226, 235, 285<U+2013>291 |isbn=0-87021-450-0}}</ref>

Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral [[Percy W. Nelles]]. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles, as exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes were modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.<ref name=Macpherson2>{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Milner |first2=Marc |year=1993 |title=Corvettes of the Royal Canadian Navy 1939<U+2013>1945|publisher=Vanwell Publishing |location=St. Catharines |pages=|isbn=1-55125-052-7}}</ref>

==Construction==
''Woodstock'' was ordered as part of the Revised 1940<U+2013>41 Flower class building program. This revised program radically changed the look of the Flower-class corvette. The ships of this program kept the water-tube boilers of the initial 1940<U+2013>41 program, but now they were housed in separate compartments for safety. The [[forecastle]] was extended, which allowed more space for berths for the crew, leading to an expansion of the crew. The bow had increased flare for better control in heavy seas. The revised Flowers of the RCN received an additional two depth charge throwers fitted amidships and more depth charges. They also came with heavier secondary armament with 20-mm [[anti-aircraft]] guns carried on the extended bridge wings. All this led to an increase in displacement, draught and length.<ref name=Macpherson2/>

''Woodstock'' was laid down by [[Collingwood Shipyards|Collingwood Shipyards Ltd.]] at [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] 23 May 1941 and launched 10 December 1941. She was commissioned 1 May 1942.<ref name=uboat>{{cite web | url = http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/874.html | work = Uboat.net | title = HMCS ''Woodstock'' (K 238) |accessdate = 6 September 2013}}</ref> During her career ''Woodstock'' had three significant refits. The first took place on the [[Humber]] in the United Kingdom. It began in September 1942 and took six weeks to finish. Her second major overhaul began in June 1943 at [[Liverpool, Nova Scotia]], and was completed at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] in mid-September. Her final refit took place again at Liverpool beginning in September 1944 and taking two months to complete.<ref name=Macpherson>{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910<U+2013>1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages=94<U+2013>95 |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}</ref>

==War service==
After arriving at Halifax 23 May 1942, ''Woodstock'' was initially assigned to the [[Western Local Escort Force]] (WLEF). However she was quickly allocated to [[Operation Torch]], the Allied invasion of North Africa. She arrived at [[Derry]] 23 September and began refitting. While performing duties associated with Operation Torch, ''Woodstock'' sank the motor torpedo boat ''MTB 105'' 250 miles northwest of the [[Azores]]. ''Woodstock'' did so after the merchant ship carrying the boat had been sunk.<ref name=Macpherson/>

''Woodstock'' returned to Canada in March 1943 and in April joined the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] (MOEF). She was assigned to escort group C-1 as a trans-Atlantic escort until June, when she was reassigned to EG 5 of the Western Support Force out of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]. Late in June she was sent to join MOEF group C-4 for one round trip across the Atlantic before departing for a refit.<ref name=Macpherson/>

After returning from refit ''Woodstock'' rejoined MOEF group C-4 until April 1944 when she was made part of [[Operation Neptune]], the naval component of the Allied invasion of [[Normandy]]. On [[D-day]], she supported the American landings at Omaha Beach.<ref name=uboat/> She was employed on duties connected to this operation for three months before departing for a refit in Canada.<ref name=Macpherson/>

After completing her refit, ''Woodstock'' departed for the west coast on 18 October 1944 and arrived at [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]] in November. She was assigned to Esquimalt Force upon arrival. She remained with this force for the remainder of her career.<ref name=Macpherson/>

==Post-war service==
''Woodstock'' was [[paid off]] 27 January 1945 from the Royal Canadian Navy as a warship and was sent to the yard for conversion as a loop-layer. On 17 May 1945 she was recommissioned as a weather ship and served as such until her final paying off 16 March 1946.<ref name=Macpherson/>

She was sold for conversion to a [[whale-catcher]] in 1948 and reappeared as the Honduran-flagged ''Olympic Winner'' in 1951. She was sold and renamed ''Otori Maru No.20'' in 1956 and ''Akitsu Maru'' in 1957. She was broken up in [[Etajima, Hiroshima|Etajima]], Japan in 1975.<ref name=Macpherson/><ref name=uboat/>
