In November 2003, Vine was in shock over her mother's recent death.<ref name=deveney/>  She was also experiencing rejection in her private life:<ref name=deveney/>
:I was just falling in love right, left and centre with these gorgeous young artists who came in the gallery. They<U+2019>d see this fat old stripper, this nutter who runs a butcher<U+2019>s shop that she thinks is an art gallery, and who thinks she<U+2019>s some artist but hasn<U+2019>t even been to art school... They probably thought, 'Christ, who is this woman who<U+2019>s texting me 20 times a day?'<ref name=deveney/>
Instead of sleeping, Vine was staying up at night painting in the badly-ventilated room, where the thick linseed oil, turps and paint fumes, which were "probably a bit dangerous", made her "a bit high".<ref name=deveney/>  

[[File:Princess Diana 1985.jpg|thumb|left|Vine became obsessed with the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and painted 30 pictures of her.]]

She had become obsessed with the story in the press that [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], had written to her butler, [[Paul Burrell]], telling him that she was afraid she would be killed in a car crash.<ref name=deveney/> Vine painted 30 pictures of Diana, but, lacking space to dry or store them, she put them all except one in a skip.<ref name=deveney/>

The gallery was on the verge of bankruptcy, when Vine exhibited the sole remaining Diana painting, ''Hi Paul can you come over I'm really frightened'', in a group show at the East London [[Transition Gallery]], run by [[Cathy Lomax]], from whom it was bought in February 2004 by [[Charles Saatchi]], then exhibited in his ''New Blood'' show at the [[Saatchi Gallery]].

''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' journalist, Catherine Deveney, visited the gallery in June 2004; Vine told her, "It's a tip."<ref name=deveney/> Deveney said it was "fascinating, like being placed slap bang in the middle of a person<U+2019>s entire life"<ref name=deveney/> with the walls whitewashed and employed as an improvised diary<U+2014>"Tuesday 4pm" written in black above the bed<U+2014><ref name=deveney/> large pink cushions on the big bed, boxes, papers, suitcases and propped-up canvases on the floor, a loaded clothes rail, and art materials on a table.<ref name=deveney/>

''[[The Times|The Times]]'' journalist, Andrew Billen, visited her in June 2004, and said the gallery was a clue that "Saatchi's Midas touch has not turned Stella's life to gold."<ref name=billen/> On the day of his visit, the front door was partly open to allow a street seller to keep his goods inside the "scuffed" gallery space, which was empty except for a gas cooker covered in graffiti text from the poetry of [[Sylvia Plath]].<ref name=billen/> He said her son's basement accommodation was "dark dungeon quarters"<ref name=billen/> accessible by an [[oubliette]], and "upstairs festers a beyond-squalid kitchen".<ref name=billen/> Vine's bedroom was on the next floor and reachable by a ladder to replace the stairs which had fallen down.<ref name=billen/> 

Her studio on the first floor contained a Mac laptop computer, a chair, and a cat sitting on an old mattress on white-painted floorboards.<ref name=billen/> Billen said, "This is not cheerful artistic anarchy; it is emotional chaos."<ref name=billen/> The studio walls were covered with work from her show ''Prozac and Private Views'', including [[Catherine Deneuve]] on circular wood, and images of Denis and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Geri Halliwell]], Kitten from Big Brother and Vine's aunt Ella.<ref name=billen/>

By June 2004, Vine had stopped answering phone calls, as she was in debt for <U+00A3>80,000, excluding money due on the property, and "It seems every call I get now is from someone saying I owe them money."<ref name=hall>Hall, Jane. "Debt, Diana and homesickness", ''[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]'',  Newcastle-upon-Tyne, p. 16, 8 June 2004.</ref> She listed the debts as comfort shopping on credit cards, loans, council tax, her car and parking fines, and said she found this very depressing: "I am a very depressed, manic person."<ref name=hall/>

The media attention following Saatchi's purchase of her Diana painting had left Vine depressed and even suicidal:<ref name=eyre>Eyre, Hermione. [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/stella-vine-completing-my-new-show-was-the-only-thing-that-saved-me-from-suicide-457090.html "Completing my new show was the only thing that saved me from suicide"], 15 July 2007.

"My <U+00A3>600-a-week coke habit just to paint; Controversial artist Stella Vine speaks about the project inspired by Kate Moss that drove her to addiction - and how only the love for her teenage son stopped her from attempting suicide.", The Evening Standard (London), 1 December 2005. Retrieved 18 December 2008.</ref> A previous partner paid her a surprise visit, which she found emotionally disturbing.<ref name=saner/> He moved to Spain.<ref name=saner/> In October 2004, she sold her gallery at auction for <U+00A3>330,000, which the agents [[Savills]] said was "quite bullish for the area",<ref name=miller>Miller, Compton. "DJ Victoria tunes into Knightsbridge; Homes gossip", ''[[Evening Standard]]'', p. 2, 13 October 2004.</ref> then moved to a rundown Spanish farmhouse with her son Jamie, their cat and <U+00A3>20,000 worth of paint and canvas.<ref name=saner/> She said, "It was typical Stella, running away when things get tough."<ref name=saner/> 

The gallery put on shows for [[James Jessop]], [[Jasper Joffe]] and [[Cathy Lomax]]. Exhibition titles included ''Something Is Already Happening'', ''Search & Destroy'', ''Vaguely Romantic'', ''Olena'', ''Frontin''', ''King'' and ''Rising Tides''.<ref name=rosyprevious>[http://www.rosywilde.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/previousshows.html "Rosy Wilde: Previous shows"] Rosy Wilde (previous shows).

==2006 reopened in Soho==

[[File:Ann-Summers-2.jpg|thumb|Rosy Wilde re-opened in 2006, above the [[Ann Summers]] shop in Wardour Street, London.]]

In 2006, she re-opened her Rosy Wilde gallery, this time on the floor above the first [[Ann Summers]] sex shop, in [[Soho]], London, at 79 [[Wardour Street]], with the entrance in Tisbury Court.<ref>[http://www.artrabbit.com/venues/venue/361/rosy_wilde "Rosy Wilde"], ArtRabbit. Retrieved 14 January 2009.</ref> She held exhibitions for artists such as [[Jemima Brown]] whose show at Rosy Wilde was described as "spooky and unhinged"<ref>[http://russellherron.blogspot.com/2006/10/rosy-wilde.html Russell Herron art blog], 2006. Retrieved 6 January 2009.</ref>. Other artists to exhibit were [[Annabel Dover]], [[Cathy Lomax]] and [[Michael Crowe]] whilst show titles included ''Force Fed Brown Bread'', ''Lux'', ''Give Me Your Blacklisted'' and ''Vignettes''.<ref>[http://wwww.commentart.com/gallery/Rosy_Wilde Comment art page for Rosy Wilde], 2006. Retrieved 6 January 2009.</ref>

Vine said that whenever she had been offered gallery representation the arrangement had broken down, and that "The art world is really exactly the same as the sex industry: you have to be completely on guard, you will get shafted, fucked over left, right and centre."<ref name=smith>Smith, David (2006)[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1759321,00.html "Art? It's like the sex trade"] ''[[The Observer]]'', 23 April 2006. Retrieved 23 April 2006.</ref> (Saatchi, however, had acted "entirely honourably")<ref name=barber>Barber, Lynne. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2007/jul/08/art "Vine Times"], July 8 2007. Retrieved 16 January 2009.</ref> She said that her priority was independence, which was the only context in which she was able to function viably as an artist, so that she preferred "running a cottage industry and maybe earning <U+00A3>50,000 a year" to earning hundreds of thousands but at the cost of participating in a manipulative system and losing independence of action.<ref name=smith/>
