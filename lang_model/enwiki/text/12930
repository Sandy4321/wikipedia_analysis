'''Hualin''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: <U+82B1><U+9E97>, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: <U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30EA><U+30F3> ''Farin'') is a fictional character in [[Namco]]'s ''Soul Series'' of fighting games. She is the shopkeeper created for the Weapon Shop within ''Soul Calibur III'', and an unlockable Bonus Character in the main game as well. She represents the "Staff" Create-a-Fighter discipline.

==Biography==

Hualin started her life as a weapon seller when she entered as a servant on a weapon store set on a small village at the foot of a mountain where a martial artist master is said to dwell. While she did her daily chores and weapon's caring, she found her life's career. From that point, she put all her efforts into becoming the finest weaponsmith in the world.

Because of the store's location, asian weapons were the predominant kind, but she also was able to get ahold of some western weapons and arabic knives. But there was so much around the world, she started wishing to know all weapons she could.

One day at the end of year she met Cepheus. He was returning from a big purchase in Ming and stopped to visit an old friend. There he was astonished at seeing Hualin's skills, but lamented her situation. Even if her handling of Ming weapons were excellent, she was inexperienced in other kind of weaponry, so he decided to ask the store's owner if he would let him take Hualin to his store, in a city where east and west met and where she would probably train her skills further. 

The store owner recognized Hualin's talent as well, but he knew her departure would be a great loss to him and his store. Upon much debating, he finally decided to let her go with Cepheus.

Hualin installed in the store of Cepheus, and started taking care of his weapon management, training daily under the old man's supervision to refine her skills even more.

==Weapon==
-- '''Cepheus Seal'''

A special staff used by Hualin. Normally, the staff would appear a small stick, but it has the ability to increase in size and thickness instantaneously. The one she has is most probably lent or given by Cepheus to her. 

==Stages==

Hualin has no stages of her own, but she appears on Tales of Souls mode as a "Prepare to Defend Yourself" challenge in the ''Lakeside Colliseum'' (caged version) among the other shopkeepers as the second opponent of a 3-characters Team Battle.

==Character Analysis==
Hualin uses a Create-a-Fighter Custom discipline, which lacks many of the options present in more developed Standard Character's movelists. Due to the strange and varied abilities of the weapon, the style itself can be difficult to keep on hold or predict, which leads to more complex mind games and traps. The style borrows many moves and a throw from [[Kilik]].

==Trivia==
*Hualin appears first on the game's Shop, in charge of the Weapons section of it. In her shop the player can buy the various extra weapons for both Standard and Bonus/Custom characters.
*Hualin's entire costume is made from Create-a-Fighter parts.  Her pants are a little unique where it features some special designs on the tip ends almost the same with the prayer pants.
*Apart from some moves, some of the Staff extra weapons are originally used by Kilik in ''Soul Calibur II''.
*Hualin and the Staff discipline contain possible references to the [[Street Fighter]] character Chun Li as Hualin resembles her slightly and the Staff movelist contains two moves that resemble Chun Li's Spinning Bird Kick and Lightning Kick.
*Interestingly, in Olcadan's ending, when he sells Soul Edge, both Lynette and Valeria appear, but Hualin doesn't, even though she's the one who actually sells the weapons.
*Hualin is the first charater in the Soul series who uses glasses.
*Hualin's Destined Battle (during Quick Play) is [[Chai Xianghua|Xianghua]].
*Hualin seems to have a cheerful and exuberant personality.
