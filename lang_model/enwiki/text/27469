'''Charles Frederick II of W<U+00FC>rttemberg-Oels''' (7 February 1690 in [[Merseburg]] &ndash; 14 December 1761 in [[Ole<U+015B>nica]]) was a [[Duke]] of [[Duchy of Oels|Oels-W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] and Regent of the Duchy of [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]].

== Life ==
Charles Frederick was a son of the Duke [[Christian Ulrich I, Duke of W<U+00FC>rttemberg-Oels|Christian Ulrich I of W<U+00FC>rttemberg-Oels]] (1652<U+2013>1704) from his second marriage to Duchess Sibylle Marie (1667<U+2013>1693), daughter of the Duke [[Christian I, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg|Christian I]] of Saxe-Merseburg.  When his father died in 1704, Charles Frederick was still a minor, so he stood under guardianship until he was declared an adult in 1707.

Charles Frederick married on 21 April 1709 in [[Stuttgart]] with Sibylle Charlotte (1690<U+2013>1735), the daughter of Duke  Frederick Ferdinand of W<U+00FC>rttemberg-Weiltingen.

From 1738, he acted as guardian of Duke [[Charles Eugene, Duke of W<U+00FC>rttemberg|Charles Eugene]] and regent of W<U+00FC>rttemberg.  In this r<U+00F4>le, he succeeded Duke [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of W<U+00FC>rttemberg-Neuenstadt|Charles Rudolph]] of W<U+00FC>rttemberg-neuenstadt, who had resigned from the regency for reasons of old age.  During his time as regent, the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] broke out in 1740.  In 1742,the [[Treaty of Breslau]] awarded his homeland Silesia to Prussia.  Nevertheless, Charles Frederick and his successors did not participate in this war.  During his regency, the administration was significantly improved and good relations with the Estates were restored.  [[Georg Bernhard Bilfinger]], Johann Eberhard Georgii and [[Frederick Augustus von Hardenberg]] served as ministers in his government.

In 1744, Emperor [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]] declared Charles Eugene an adult, thereby ending Charles Frederick time as regent of W<U+00FC>rttemberg.

Charles Frederick's marriage remained childless.  In 1744, he resigned from the government in Oels, in favour of his younger brother [[Charles Christian Erdmann, Duke of W<U+00FC>rttemberg-Oels|Charles Christian Erdmann]].  He then resided for some time in [[Mi<U+0119>dzyb<U+00F3>rz]], and then moved to Oels, where he died in 1761, at the age of 72.
