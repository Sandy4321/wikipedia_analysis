'''SMS ''Kaiserin''''' ("His Majesty's Ship ''Empress''"){{efn|name=SMS}} was the third vessel of the {{sclass|Kaiser|battleship|4}} of [[battleship]]s of the [[Germany|German]] [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]]. ''Kaiserin''{{'}}s keel was laid in November 1910 at the [[Howaldtswerke]] dockyard in [[Kiel]]. She was launched on 11 November 1911 and was commissioned into the fleet on 14 May 1913. The ship was equipped with ten {{convert|30.5|cm|in|sp=us|adj=on}} guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of {{convert|22.1|kn}}. ''Kaiserin'' was assigned to the [[III Battle Squadron]] and later the [[IV Battle Squadron]] of the [[High Seas Fleet]] for the majority of her career, including [[World War I]].

Along with her four sister ships, {{SMS|Kaiser|1911|2}}, {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}, {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig Albert||2}}, and {{SMS|Prinzregent Luitpold||2}}, ''Kaiserin'' participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I, including the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May&nbsp;and 1 June 1916. The ship was also involved in [[Operation Albion]], an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the [[Gulf of Riga]], in October 1917. She later saw action during the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917.

After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in November 1918, the [[Royal Navy]] interned ''Kaiserin'' and most of the [[capital ship]]s of the High Seas Fleet in [[Scapa Flow]]. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] negotiated the final version of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|ordered the fleet to be scuttled]] to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. ''Kaiserin'' was raised in May 1936 and subsequently [[ship breaking|broken up]] for scrap.

== Construction ==

[[File:Kaiser class diagram.jpg|thumb|left|The shaded areas represent the portions of the ship protected by armor|alt=A large warship with five gun turrets, two tall masts, two funnels, and heavy armor protection.]]

Ordered under the contract name ''Ersatz Hagen'' as a replacement for the obsolete [[coastal defense ship]] {{SMS|Hagen||2}},{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=6}}{{efn|name=provisional names}} ''Kaiserin'' was laid down at the [[Howaldtswerke]] dockyard in [[Kiel]] in November 1910.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=147}} She was launched on 11 November 1911, after which fitting-out work was completed.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=18}} At the launching ceremony, Admiral [[Hans von Koester]] gave a speech and Princess [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Victoria Louise]] christened the ship.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=70}} A dockyard crew delivered the ship to the Navy on 13 May 1913; she was commissioned into the fleet the following day. During trials the ship's turbine engines were damaged, and ''Kaiserin'' did not join the fleet until 13 December 1913.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=18}}

The ship was {{convert|172.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} long [[Length overall|overall]] and displaced a maximum of {{convert|27000|MT|sp=us}}.  She had a beam of {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|9.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward and {{convert|8.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} aft. ''Kaiserin'' was powered by three sets of Parsons turbines, each of which drove a single propeller shaft; they were supplied with steam by 16 coal-fired boilers. The powerplant produced a top speed of {{convert|22.1|kn}}. She carried {{convert|3600|MT|sp=us}} of coal, which enabled a maximum range of {{convert|7900|nmi|sp=us}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|12|kn|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=26}}

''Kaiserin'' was armed with a main battery of ten [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun]]s in five twin turrets.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=26}} The ship dispensed with the inefficient hexagonal turret arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, with two of them arranged in a [[superfire|superfiring pair]] aft. The other two turrets were placed [[Glossary of nautical terms#E|''en echelon'']] amidships, such that both could fire on the [[broadside]].{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=4}}{{efn|name=hexagonal arrangement}} The ship was also armed with fourteen [[15 cm SK L/45]] guns in [[casemate]]s amidships, eight [[8.8 cm SK L/45 naval gun|8.8&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in casemates and four 8.8&nbsp;cm L/45 anti-aircraft guns. The ship's armament was rounded out by five {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes, all mounted in the hull.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=26}}

== Service history ==

After joining the [[III Battle Squadron]] in December 1913, ''Kaiserin'' participated in the routine fleet training exercises. Squadron exercises were conducted in February, followed by fleet maneuvers, both in the North Sea. The fleet trained again in May, in both the North and Baltic Seas.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=18}} ''Kaiserin'' left Germany on 7 July for the annual summer cruise to Norway, but was recalled prematurely on 22 July because of rising international tensions following the [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]].{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|pp=14, 18}} Upon returning to Germany, ''Kaiserin'' steamed to [[Brunsb<U+00FC>ttel]] on 24 July, where she was the first battleship to traverse the recently deepened [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]]. The voyage required lightening, and in just under twelve hours ''Kaiserin'' exited the locks at [[Holtenau]] in Kiel where she met the rest of her squadron. On 31 July, the entire squadron returned to the North Sea via the Canal.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}} At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom, with its powerful [[Grand Fleet]], declared war on Germany.{{sfn|Herwig|p=144}}

''Kaiserin'' was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2<U+2013>3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15<U+2013>16 December.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}} This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl]], the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral Ingenohl intended to use the [[battlecruiser]]s of Rear Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]]'s [[I Scouting Group]] to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet.{{sfn|Herwig|pp=149<U+2013>150}} Early on 15 December the fleet left port to [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby|raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby]]. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts<U+2014>including ''Kaiserin'' and her four [[sister ship|sisters]]<U+2014>and eight [[pre-dreadnought]]s came to within {{convert|10|nmi|abbr=on}} of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival [[destroyer]] screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=31<U+2013>33}}

''Kaiserin'' went into the Baltic for squadron training from 23 to 29 January 1916. Upon returning to the North Sea, the ship went into drydock in [[Wilhelmshaven]] for periodic maintenance, which lasted from 31 January to 20 February.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}} The Kaiser removed Ingenohl from his post on 2 February, following the loss of {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher}} at the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] the month before. Admiral [[Hugo von Pohl]] succeeded him as the commander of the fleet.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=43<U+2013>44}} Pohl continued the policy of sweeps into the North Sea to destroy isolated British formations. The fleet conducted a series of advances into the North Sea throughout 1915; ''Kaiserin'' was present for the sweeps on 17 to 18 May, 29 to 30 May, 10 August, 11 to 12 September, and 23 to 24 October. The III Squadron completed the year with another round of unit training in the Baltic from 5 to 20 December.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}}

Pohl's tenure as fleet commander was brief; by January 1916 [[hepatic cancer]] had weakened him to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] in January.{{sfn|Herwig|p=161}} Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=50}} The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5 to 7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the [[Hoofden]].{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|pp=32, 35}} ''Kaiserin'' was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2 to 3 April. The fleet conducted another sortie on 21 to 22 April.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}}

=== Battle of Jutland ===

{{main|Battle of Jutland}}
[[File:Jutland1916.jpg|thumb|350px|Maps showing the maneuvers of the British (blue) and German (red) fleets on 31 May&nbsp;<U+2013> 1 June 1916; [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Jutland1916.jpg click] for a larger view.|alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast]]

''Kaiserin'' was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of [[Jutland]] which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916; her commander at the time was ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>n zur See]]'' (''KzS'') [[Karl Sievers]].{{sfn|Scheer|p=137}} The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, ''Kaiserin'' was the second ship in the VI Division of III Squadron and the seventh ship in the line, directly astern of ''Kaiser'' and ahead of ''Prinzregent Luitpold''. The VI Division was behind only the V Division, consisting of the four {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|1}}s. The eight battleships of the {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|5}} and {{sclass|Nassau|battleship|4}}es assigned to the I and II Divisions in I Squadron followed the VI Division. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=286}}{{efn|name=unit denotations}}

Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]]. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|2}}, shortly after 17:00,{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=94<U+2013>95}} and {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}}, less than half an hour later.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=100<U+2013>101}} At 16:19, ''Kaiserin'' was forced to temporarily stop the turbine on the center shaft, as the condenser had started leaking. The crew were able to restart the engine before ''Kaiserin'' came into action.{{sfn|Campbell|p=36}} By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig||2}}, spotted both the I&nbsp;Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a [[Boxing the compass|two-point]] turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=110}}{{efn|name=compass points}}

At approximately 17:40, the British light cruiser {{HMS|Nottingham|1913|2}} fired a single torpedo at ''Kaiserin'' at the extreme range of at least {{convert|16500|yd|m|abbr=on}}, which failed to find its target.{{sfn|Campbell|p=53}} After Scheer ordered the fleet to open fire, ''Kaiserin'' briefly engaged the battlecruiser {{HMS|New Zealand|1911|2}}; ''Kaiserin'' failed to score a hit and by 17:54 ''New Zealand'' and the rest of the British battlecruisers had increased speed and moved out of range.{{sfn|Campbell|p=54}} The British destroyers {{HMS|Nestor|1915|2}} and {{HMS|Nomad||2}}, which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, lay directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=114}} ''Kaiserin'' and her three sisters fired on ''Nomad'' with their secondary guns while the I Squadron battleships dispatched ''Nestor''.{{sfn|Campbell|p=101}} At around 19:00, the German battle line came into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; ''Kaiserin'' fired three salvos from her main battery at an unidentified four-funneled cruiser but made no hits.{{sfn|Campbell|p=111}}

Shortly after 19:00, a shell from the British battlecruiser {{HMS|Invincible|1908|2}} disabled the German cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}}; Rear Admiral Behncke in ''K<U+00F6>nig'' attempted to maneuver the III Squadron to cover the stricken cruiser.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=137}} Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered ''Wiesbaden'' with fire from their main guns. The eight III Squadron battleships fired on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=138}} The armored cruisers {{HMS|Defence|1907|2}}, {{HMS|Warrior|1905|2}}, and {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|2}} joined in the attack on the crippled ''Wiesbaden''.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=139}} Between 19:14 and 19:17, several German battleships and battlecruisers opened fire on ''Defence'' and ''Warrior''.{{sfn|Campbell|p=152}} ''Kaiserin'' initially engaged one of the battleships in the British 5th Battle Squadron and scored a hit; according to ''Kaiserin''{{'}}s logs, the ship in question was {{HMS|Malaya||2}}.{{sfn|Campbell|p=154}} After three minutes firing at ''Malaya'', ''Kaiserin'' shifted fire to ''Defence''.{{sfn|Campbell|p=152}} In short succession, the German dreadnoughts hit ''Defence'' with several heavy caliber shells. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a tremendous explosion, destroyed the cruiser.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=140}} After ''Defence'' exploded, ''Kaiserin'' shifted her fire to a target believed to be the battlecruiser {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}}. Heavy haze forced ''Kaiserin'' to check fire after two salvos.{{sfn|Campbell|p=153}}

By 20:00, Scheer ordered the German line to complete a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=169}} The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. ''Kaiserin'' had come too close to ''Prinzregent Luitpold'' and was forced to haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside ''Kaiserin'' at high speed. As a result, ''Kaiserin'' had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=200<U+2013>201}} The turn reversed the order of the German line; ''Kaiserin'' was now the seventh ship from the rear of the German line.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=172}} At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. ''Kaiserin'' was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.{{sfn|Campbell|p=275}}

After a series of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached [[Horns Reef]] by 04:00 on 1&nbsp;June.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=246<U+2013>247}} The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer [[roadstead]] and ''Kaiserin'', ''Kaiser'', ''Prinzregent Luitpold'', and {{SMS|Kronprinz|1914|2}} stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven.{{sfn|Campbell|p=320}} The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=263}} In the course of the battle, ''Kaiserin'' fired one-hundred and sixty 30.5&nbsp;cm shells and one-hundred and thirty-five 15&nbsp;cm rounds.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=292}} She emerged from the battle completely unscathed.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}}

=== Subsequent operations ===

In early August, ''Kaiserin'' and the rest of the operational III Squadron units conducted divisional training in the Baltic.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}} On 18 August, Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers<U+2014>{{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}<U+2014>supported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including ''Kaiser'', would trail behind and provide cover.{{sfn|Massie|p=682}} On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a [[zeppelin]] about a British unit in the area.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=15}} As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.{{sfn|Massie|p=683}}

Another fleet advance followed on 18 to 20 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, ''Kaiserin'' took part in an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two [[U-boat]]s, {{SMU|U-20|Germany|2}} and {{SMU|U-30|Germany|2}}, that had become stranded there. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December;{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}} the four ''K<U+00F6>nig''-class battleships remained in III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned {{SMS|Bayern|1915|2}}, while the five ''Kaiser''-class ships, including ''Kaiserin'', were transferred to [[IV Battle Squadron|IV Squadron]].{{sfn|Halpern|p=214}} While transiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on 14 March 1917, ''Kaiserin'' became grounded. One of her bilge keels was damaged and some {{convert|280|MT|abbr=on}} of water entered the ship. Repairs were conducted at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard in Kiel]] from 15 to 18 March. ''Kaiserin'' returned to the North Sea on 30 March and remained there on guard duty until 8 June. On 9 June, she went to the Baltic for a month-long series of exercises, which were completed on 2 July. She resumed guard duties in the German Bight on 3 July and continued in this role until 11 September, when ''Kaiserin'' was detached to join the special unit assigned to [[Operation Albion]].{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=19}}

=== Operation Albion ===

{{main|Operation Albion}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-074-34, Besetzung der Insel <U+00D6>sel, Truppenanlandung.jpg|thumb|German troops landing at <U+00D6>sel, October 1917|alt=A small boat packed with soldiers passes in front of a cruiser and several transport ships]]

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The ''Admiralstab'' (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]], and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the [[S<U+00F5>rve Peninsula|Sworbe Peninsula]].{{sfn|Halpern|p=213}} On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture <U+00D6>sel and [[Muhu|Moon]] Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the [[flagship]], ''Moltke'', along with the III and IV&nbsp;Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of [[naval mine|mine]] warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=214<U+2013>215}} By this time, the IV Battle Squadron had come under the command of Vice Admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]].{{sfn|Staff, ''Battle for the Baltic Islands''|p=4}} Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] and [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Tsarevitch'']], the [[armored cruiser]]s ''Bayan'', ''Admiral Makarov'', and ''Diana'', 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on <U+00D6>sel numbered some 14,000 men.{{sfn|Halpern|p=215}}

The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when ''Moltke'' and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while ''Kaiserin'' and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the [[Sworbe Peninsula]] on <U+00D6>sel.{{sfn|Halpern|p=215}} ''Kaiserin'', along with ''Kaiser'' and ''Prinzregent Luitpold'', were tasked with silencing the Russian guns at [[Hundsort]] on <U+00D6>sel, which had taken ''Moltke'' under fire. The ships opened fire at 05:44, and by 07:45, Russian firing had ceased and German troops were moving ashore.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battle for the Baltic Islands''|pp=20<U+2013>21}} Two days later, Souchon left Tagga Bay with ''Kaiserin'', ''Friedrich der Grosse'', and ''Prinzregent Luitpold'' to support German ground forces advancing on the Sworbe Peninsula.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battle for the Baltic Islands''|p=67}} ''Kaiserin'' was assigned to suppress a Russian battery at [[Zerel]], though heavy fog delayed her from engaging her target. The Russians opened fire first, which was quickly returned by ''Kaiserin'' and ''K<U+00F6>nig Albert''. ''Friedrich der Grosse'' came to the two ships' assistance; the three battleships fired a total of 120 large-caliber shells over the span of an hour. The fourth Russian salvo [[:wikt:straddle|straddled]] ''Kaiserin'', which began to steer erratically to avoid the Russian gunfire. The heavy firing prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battle for the Baltic Islands''|pp=70<U+2013>72}}

On the night of 15 October, ''Kaiserin'' and ''K<U+00F6>nig Albert'' were sent to replenish their coal stocks in [[Putzig]].{{sfn|Staff, ''Battle for the Baltic Islands''|p=81}} On the 19th, they were briefly joined in Putzig by ''Friedrich der Grosse'', which continued on to [[Kuressaare|Arensburg]] with ''Moltke''.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battle for the Baltic Islands''|p=140}} The next morning, Vice Admiral [[Ehrhard Schmidt]] ordered the special naval unit to be dissolved and returned to the North Sea. In a communique to the naval headquarters, Schmidt noted that "''Kaiserin'' and ''K<U+00F6>nig Albert'' can immediately be detached from Putzig to the North Sea."{{sfn|Staff, ''Battle for the Baltic Islands''|p=145}} The two ships then proceeded to Kiel via [[Danzig]]; after reaching Kiel, they transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal back to the North Sea.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=20}}

=== Final operations ===

On 17 November 1917, ''Kaiserin'' and ''Kaiser'' were assigned to provide cover for the II Scouting Group while it conducted a minesweeping operation in the North Sea. Significant British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers, attacked the II Scouting Group; the two battleships immediately steamed to their assistance. In the ensuing [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]], ''Kaiserin'' scored a hit on the light cruiser {{HMS|Caledon|D53|2}}.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=20}} The battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}} briefly engaged the German dreadnoughts, but both forces withdrew.{{sfn|Konstam|p=35}} After the action, Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]] criticized ''Kaiserin''{{'}}s commander, ''KzS'' [[Kurt Grasshoff]], for lagging too far behind the minesweepers to provide adequate protection. He was subsequently relieved of command of the ship.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz|p=71}} ''Kaiserin'' went into drydock for maintenance on 22 December, and work lasted until 5 February 1918. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23<U+2013>25 April 1918, which had been intended to intercept a heavily defended convoy between Britain and Norway; faulty German intelligence prevented the Germans from catching the convoy.{{sfn|Halpern|pp=418<U+2013>419}} After returning to port, she resumed guard duties in the German Bight. The IV Squadron undertook another training exercise in the Baltic from 18 June to 13 August. A final round of drills took place on 22<U+2013>28 October.{{sfn|Staff, ''Battleships''|p=20}}

''Kaiserin'' and her four sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from its base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer<U+2014>by now the [[Grand Admiral]] (''Gro<U+00DF>admiral'') of the fleet<U+2014>intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy. The goal was to improve Germany's bargaining position in the imminent peace negotiations, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=280<U+2013>281}} On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} and then on several other battleships [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]].{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=281<U+2013>282}} The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=282}} Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated, "I no longer have a navy."{{sfn|Herwig|p=252}}

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, in the British naval base in [[Scapa Flow]].{{sfn|Tarrant|p=282}} Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral [[Adolf von Trotha]] made clear to Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any circumstances.{{sfn|Herwig|p=256}} The fleet rendezvoused with the British [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Cardiff|D58|2}}, which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships.{{sfn|Herwig|pp=254<U+2013>255}} Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Herwig|p=255}}

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|ordered the ships to be sunk]] at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.{{sfn|Herwig|p=256}} ''Kaiserin'' sank at 14:00; she was subsequently raised on 14 May 1936 and broken up later that year in [[Rosyth]].{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=26}}

{{efn
| name = foremast
| The foremast illustrated here is the heavy tubular type fitted only to {{SMS|Kaiser|1911|2}} and {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}. ''Kaiserin'' was equipped with a standard pole mast. See {{harvnb|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=26}}.
}}

{{efn
| name = SMS
| "SMS" stands for "''[[Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t Schiff]]''" ({{lang-de|His Majesty's Ship}}).
}}

{{efn
| name = provisional names
| German warships were ordered under provisional names. For new additions to the fleet, they were given a single letter; for those ships intended to replace older or lost vessels, they were ordered as "Ersatz (name of the ship to be replaced)".
}}

{{efn
| name = hexagonal arrangement
| The hexagonal arrangement was inefficient, as the main battery of twelve guns was limited to a broadside of eight guns. See {{harvnb|Hore|p=67}}. ''Kaiserin''{{'}}s broadside was two guns heavier, despite the fact that she carried two fewer guns than the ships of the ''Helgoland'' class. See {{harvnb|Hore|p=69}}.
}}

{{efn
| name = unit denotations
| German units are typically denoted by [[Roman numeral]]s, while British units are typically denoted with [[Arabic numeral]]s.
}}

{{efn
| name = compass points
| The compass can be divided into 32 points, each corresponding to 11.25 degrees. A two-point turn to port would alter the ships' course by 22.5 degrees.
}}
