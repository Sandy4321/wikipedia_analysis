There are many '''Grade I listed buildings in Somerset''', England. The [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]] consists of a [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|non-metropolitan county]] and two [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. The [[Districts of England|districts]] of Somerset are [[West Somerset]], [[South Somerset]], [[Taunton Deane]], [[Mendip]] and [[Sedgemoor]]. The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which were established on 1 April 1996 following the break up of the [[county of Avon]], are [[North Somerset]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset]]. These unitary authorities include areas that were once part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950493_en_1.htm |title=The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995 |accessdate=2007-12-09 |format= |work=HMSO }}</ref>

In the United Kingdom, the term [[listed building]] refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be "buildings of exceptional interest".<ref name="MCC">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=514&documentID=1906|title=What is a listed building?|publisher=Manchester City Council|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref> Listing was begun by a provision in the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]]. Once listed, strict limitations are imposed on the modifications allowed to a building's structure or fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the [[Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=2133903|title=Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (c. 9)|publisher=Ministry of Justice|accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> rests with [[English Heritage]], a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]; local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations.

Each of the districts include [[Norman architecture|Norman]]- or [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-era churches, many of which are included in the [[Somerset towers]], a collection of distinctive, mostly [[spire]]less [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church towers. The prolific construction of the towers -- some started before 1360 -- was typically accomplished by a master mason and a small team of itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish laborers, according to Poyntz Wright. <ref name="poyntz">{{cite book |last= Poyntz Wright|first= Peter|title= The Parish Church Towers of Somerset, Their construction, craftsmanship and chronology 1350 - 1550|year= 1981|month= |publisher= Avebury Publishing Company|isbn= 0861275020|}}</ref> But other authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers based on early examples of Perpendicular [[Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England|design and ornamentation developed for cathedrals]] -- their most important commissions. Contract builders carried out the plans, adding a distinctive mix of innovative details and decorations as new designs emerged over the years.<ref name="harvey">{{cite book |last = Harvey| first = John H.| title = Somerset Perpendicular -- The Church Towers and the Dating Evidence | publisher = The Ancient Monuments Society | location = London | date = 1984 | pages = 158-173 }}</ref> These are included in the [[List of towers in Somerset]].

Apart from the churches each area has its own characteristics. Most of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath's]] Grade I listed buildings are made from the local golden-coloured [[Bath Stone]], and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. Their dominant architectural style is [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]],<ref name="gadd"/> which in Mendip the greatest concentrations  are around the cathedral and abbey in [[Wells]] and [[Glastonbury]]. North Somerset features bridges and piers along with a selection of [[Manor house]s. The Sedgemoor district has many buildings related to trade and commerce centered on [[Bridgwater]], while in South Somerset abbeys, priories and farmhouses predominate. Taunton Deane includes the defensive [[Taunton Castle]] and [[Dunster Castle]] and related buildings in [[Dunster]] feature in West Somerset.
