{{otherusesof|Great Officer of State}}

The '''Great Officers of the Realm''' (Swedish: '''''De h<U+00F6>gre riks<U+00E4>mbetsm<U+00E4>nnen''''') were the five leading members of the [[Privy Council of Sweden|Swedish Privy Council]] from the later parts of the 16th century to around 1680. With the constitution of 1634, the five officers became heads of five different branches of government (Swedish: ''kollegium''). The same constitution also declared that the great officers were to act as regents during the minorities of kings or regnal queens. All great officers of the realm were abolished by king [[Carl XI|Carl XI of Sweden]]. The Lord High Steward and the Lord High Chancellor offices were revived in the late 18th century, but were soon removed again.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok - Riks<U+00E4>mbetsm<U+00E4>n (1916)">{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfcc/0217.html|title=Nordisk Familjebok - Riks<U+00E4>mbetsm<U+00E4>n|date=1916|work=Nordisk Familjebok at runeberg.org|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

=== Lord High Steward ===
{{main|Lord High Steward of Sweden}}
The title meant no particular assignment until 1614, when Lord High Steward [[Magnus Brahe]] was put in charge of the newly established Svea Court of Appeal, the highest court of Sweden at the time. The steward became responsible of supervising justice in Sweden.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok - Drots">{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/display.pl?mode=facsimile&work=nfbf&page=0475|title=Nordisk Familjebok - Drots|work=Nordisk Familjebok at runeberg.org|pages=881-882|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

=== Lord High Constable ===
{{main|Lord High Constable of Sweden}}
The title meant no particular assignment until 1630, when Lord High Constable [[Jacob De la Gardie]] became president of the Council of War (Swedish: first Krigsr<U+00E4>tten, later Krigsr<U+00E5>det and, from 1634, Krigskollegium). As such he was chief of the army.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok - Marsk II">{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/display.pl?mode=facsimile&work=nfbq&page=0570|title=Nordisk Familjebok - Marsk|work=Nordisk Familjebok at runeberg.org|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

=== Lord High Admiral ===
{{main|Lord High Admiral of Sweden}}
The Lord High Admiral was head of the Admiralty of Sweden (Swedish: ''Amiralitetskollegium'' from 1634) and the Swedish navy.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok - Riksamiral">{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfcc/0167.html| title=Nordisk Familjebok - Riksamiral|date=1916|work=Nordisk Familjebok at runeberg.org| language=Swedish| accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

=== Lord High Chancellor ===
{{main|Lord High Chancellor of Sweden}}
The Lord High Chancellor was assigned to ensure that the orders of the king and government were followed. Along the way, the assignments of the chancellor increased to the amount that a chancellery, the [[Privy Council Chancellery of Sweden|Privy Council Chancellery]], had to be established. The chancellery became one of the governmental branches and the chancellor acted as head of it. Albeit fourth in rank among the great officers, the Lord High Chancellor became the most important figure in the Privy Council. The chancellor was head of the relations with foreign powers.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok - Rikskansler">{{cite web |url=http://runeberg.org/display.pl?mode=facsimile&work=nfam&page=0593|title=Nordisk Familjebok - "Rikskansler"| work=runeberg.org|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

=== Lord High Treasurer ===
{{main|Lord High Treasurer of Sweden}}
The Lord High Treasurer had the responsibility to supervise issues concerning the economy of the state. The office holder was head of the Chambers, which in 1634 was declared one of five departments of the government under the name ''Kammarkollegium''.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok (Uggleupplagan) - Riksskattm<U+00E4>staren">{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nfcc/0212.html|title=Nordisk Familjebok (Uggleupplagan) - Riksskattm<U+00E4>staren |date=1916|work=Nordisk Familjebok at runeberg.org|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

==The smaller officers==
Below the great officers in rank, were a number of smaller officers of the realm (Swedish: ''de l<U+00E4>gre riks<U+00E4>mbetsm<U+00E4>nnen''). These were [[Marshal]] of the Realm (''riksmarskalk''), [[Equerry]] of the Realm (''riksstallm<U+00E4>stare''), [[Forester]] of the Realm (''riksj<U+00E4>gm<U+00E4>staren''), General [[Quartermaster]] (''generalkvarterm<U+00E4>staren'') and ''rikstygm<U+00E4>staren''.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok - Riks<U+00E4>mbetsm<U+00E4>n (1916)"/>

In the late 1600s, king [[Carl XI]] removed not only the great officers but the smaller officers as well. The Marshal of the Realm and the Equerry of the Realm offices were both revived by king [[Gustav III]] in the late 1700s.<ref name="Nordisk Familjebok - Riks<U+00E4>mbetsm<U+00E4>n (1916)"/> Among both the greater and smaller officers, the only title to exist in present day Sweden, is the Marshal of the Realm.
