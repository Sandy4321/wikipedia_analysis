'''Adrienne Elizabeth Clarke''' [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]] (born 6 January 1938) has been a Professor of [[Botany]] at [[University of Melbourne]] since 1985, and director of the [[Plant Cell Biology Research Centre]] since 1982. She is a former chairman of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) and Lieutenant [[Governor of Victoria]].

==Biography==
Born in Melbourne on the 6th of January, Clarke was educated at [[Ruyton Girls' School]] and the University of Melbourne.

Professor Clarke is a former chairman of [[CSIRO]] and Lieutenant [[Governor of Victoria]].  She has also been a director of a number of public companies and currently sits on a number of boards including the [[Australian Research Centre for Urban Ecology]], the [[Australian Advisory Board of the Global Nature Conservancy]], and in 2010 joined the [[La Trobe University]] Council.  She succeeded [[Sylvia Walton]] as Chancellor of [[La Trobe University]] on 26 February 2011.

She is author of four major scientific books dealing with chemistry, cell biology and genetics, and has served on the [[Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council]] and on the [[Victorian Business Round Table]]. Her scientific work, which provides critical insight to the biochemistry and genetics of flowering plants, their reproduction, and their growth, has led to industrial applications for next-generation controls of insect pests and fungal disease of crops.

As a leading academic, Professor Clarke is a Fellow of both the [[Australian Academy of Science]] and the [[Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering]].  She is a Foreign Associate of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] (USA), a Foreign Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and a Fellow of [[Janet Clarke Hall]] in Melbourne.<ref name=FJCH>{{cite web |title=Fellows |work=Staff and Governance |publisher=Janet Clarke Hall, The University of Melbourne |year=2012 |accessdate=12 February 2013 |url=http://www.jch.unimelb.edu.au/governance.html }}</ref>

We met in 1993 when Adrienne joined the Alcoa Board. She was our only female and certainly our only Professor of Botany. It was a timely appointment because of the mining industry<U+2019>s growing concern for the environment.  Since 1985, Professor Clarke has had a personal chair in the School of Botany at the University of Melbourne.  She is an outstanding environmental scientist and from 1991-1996, she was Chairman of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. She also directed the Plant Cell Biology Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, from 1982 <U+2013> 1999. She is our specialist in plant molecular biology. Adrienne brought new perspectives to our Board discussions and was a quick learner about all facets of Alco<U+2019>s business.  She is very intelligent and very charming.  When our Alcoa Board was disbanded, Adrienne in 1996 joined the Western Mining Board. Since 1994, she has served on the Boards of Fisher and Paykel, Woolworths and the AMP Society.  In her spare time, she served as Lieutenant Governor of Victoria from 1997 <U+2013> 2000!  She also served on the Committee for Melbourne from 1994-2003. Since 2002, she has been a member of the Mental Health Research Institute.  Adrienne has been an outstanding contributor to biological science and to commercial ventures which develop from the science.  She has been much honoured by her peers for the advancement of science, both in Australia and
17
overseas.  When we first sat together at the Alcoa Board, I did not realise that I was sitting beside a world-renowned plant geneticist. Professor Clarke was the first appointed Laureatic Professor at the University of Melbourne. Her team was the first to clone the gene which regulates self-compatibility in plants and the first to clone the <U+201C>c<U+201D> DNA of an Arabinogelactan Protein. She has brought great honour to the University of Melbourne Botany School.  In 2001 she was appointed Ambassador for Bio Technology for Victoria.  During the 90<U+2019>s she was the president of the International Society for Plant Molecular Biology. The USA recognised Adrienne<U+2019>s contribution to science in 1993 when she was appointed a Foreign Associate of the USA National Academy of Sciences.  She is a highly respected fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. In 1993 the Australia Day Council awarded Adrienne the outstanding achievers award.  In 2006 she was honoured with the President<U+2019>s Medal from the Australian and New Zealand Society for Cellular and Developmental Biology.  Adrienne has devoted many years as an advisor to both Commonwealth and
18
State Governments on matters relating to Science, Technology, Food production, Agra-business and Foreign Aid. She has played a leading role on the world stage in many areas of plant sciences. In 2003, she was an independent scientist-at-large to a World Bank steering committee on agricultural science.  Alone or in collaboration with other biological scientists, she has published four books, thirty-eight book chapters and 145 scientific papers.  Professor Clarke was a member of the Prime Minister<U+2019>s Supermarket to Asia Council from 1996 to 2002.  Adrienne<U+2019>s ability to marry science with business is remarkable. Her intellect and enquiring mind, her composure and logical approach to problems are strength in any boardroom. Her achievements are also a reminder that decision-making in the corporate sector requires the balanced view of male and female board members.  As one of our pioneering scientists and company directors, Adrienne will hopefully inspire the corporate sector to tap more frequently the vast resource of talented females, which exists in Australia.  Our paths cross rarely these days, but when they do I am reminded how fortunate I was to share some time on the Alcoa Board with one of Australia<U+2019>s outstanding scientists.
19
I am hopeful that Adrienne will inspire and encourage lots of other intelligent women to serve in the male dominated corporate boardrooms. -->
