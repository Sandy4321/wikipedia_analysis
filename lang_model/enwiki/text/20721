[[File:Italien zur Langobardenzeit.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Lombard possessions in Italy: The Lombard Kingdom ''(Neustria, Austria and Tuscia)'' and the Lombard Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento]]

The '''Lombards''' or '''Langobards''' ({{lang-la|Langobard<U+012B>}}, Italian ''Longobardi''), were a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] who ruled [[Italy]] from 568 to 774.

The Lombard historian [[Paul the Deacon]] wrote in the ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' that the Lombards descended from a small tribe called the ''Winnili''<ref name="ReferenceA">Priester, 16. From the [[Old Germanic]] ''Winnan'', meaning "fighting", "winning".</ref> who dwelt in southern Scandinavia<ref name="dick">Harrison, D.; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv'' F<U+00E4>lth & H<U+00E4>ssler, V<U+00E4>rnamo. ISBN 978-91-27-35725-9 p. 74</ref> (''Scadanan'') before migrating to seek new lands. In the 1st century AD, they formed part of the [[Suebi]], in northwestern [[Germany]]. By the end of the 5th century, they had moved into the area roughly coinciding with modern [[Austria]] north of the [[Danube]] river, where they subdued the [[Heruls]] and later fought frequent wars with the [[Gepid]]s. The Lombard king [[Audoin]] defeated the Gepid leader [[Thurisind]] in 551 or 552; his successor [[Alboin]] eventually destroyed the Gepids at the [[Battle of Asfeld]] in 567.

Following this victory, Alboin decided to lead his people to Italy, which had become severely depopulated and devastated after the long [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>554)]] between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] there. The Lombards were joined by numerous [[Saxons]], Heruls, Gepids, [[Bulgars]], [[Thuringians]], and [[Ostrogoths]], and their invasion of Italy was almost unopposed. By late 569 they had conquered all the principal cities north of the [[Po River]] except [[Pavia]], which fell in 572. At the same time, they occupied areas in [[central Italy|central]] and [[southern Italy]]. They established a [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard Kingdom]] in Italy, later named ''[[Regnum Italicum]]'' ("Kingdom of Italy"), which reached its zenith under the 8th-century ruler [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]]. In 774, the Kingdom was conquered by the [[Franks|Frankish]] King [[Charlemagne]] and integrated into his [[Francia|Empire]]. However, Lombard nobles continued to rule southern parts of the [[Italian peninsula]] well into the 11th century when they were [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquered]] by the [[Normans]] and added to their [[County of Sicily]]. Their legacy is also apparent in the regional name, [[Lombardy]] (in the north of Italy).

The fullest account of Lombard origins, history, and practices is the ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' (''History of the Lombards'') of [[Paul the Deacon]], written in the 8th century. Paul's chief source for Lombard origins, however, is the 7th-century ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'' (''Origin of the Lombard People'').

The ''Origo Gentis Langobardorum'' tells the story of a small tribe called the ''Winnili''<ref name="ReferenceA"/> dwelling in southern [[Scandinavia]]<ref name="dick">Harrison, D. & Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv'' F<U+00E4>lth & H<U+00E4>ssler, V<U+00E4>rnamo. 978-91-27-35725-9 p. 74</ref> (''Scadanan'') (the ''[[Codex Gothanus]]'' writes that the Winnili first dwelt near a river called ''Vindilicus'' on the extreme boundary of [[Gaul]]).<ref>CG, II.</ref> The Winnili were split into three groups and one part left their native land to seek foreign fields. The reason for the exodus was probably [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].<ref>Menghin, 13.</ref> The departing people were led by the brothers Ybor and Aio and their mother Gambara<ref>Priester, 16. Grimm, ''Deutsche Mythologie'', I, 336. Old Germanic for "[[Strenuus]]", "[[Sibyl]]".</ref> and arrived in the lands of ''Scoringa'', perhaps the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast<ref>Priester, 16</ref> or the [[Bardengau]] on the banks of the [[Elbe]].<ref>Hammerstein-Loxton, 56.</ref> Scoringa was ruled by the [[Vandals]] and their chieftains, the brothers Ambri and Assi, who granted the Winnili a choice between tribute or war.

The Winnili were young and brave and refused to pay tribute, saying "It is better to maintain liberty by arms than to stain it by the payment of tribute."<ref name="PD, VII">PD, VII.</ref> The Vandals prepared for war and consulted Godan (the god [[Odin]]<ref name="dick"/>), who answered that he would give the victory to those whom he would see first at sunrise.<ref name="PD, VIII">PD, VIII.</ref> The Winnili were fewer in number<ref name="PD, VII"/> and Gambara sought help from Frea (the goddess [[Frigg]]<ref name="dick"/>), who advised that all Winnili women should tie their hair in front of their faces like beards and march in line with their husbands. At sunrise, Frea turned her husband's bed so that he was facing east, and woke him. So Godan spotted the Winnili first and asked, "Who are these long-beards?," and Frea replied, "My lord, thou hast given them the name, now give them also the victory."<ref>OGL, appendix 11.</ref> From that moment onwards, the Winnili were known as the ''Longbeards'' (Latinised as ''Langobardi'', Italianised as ''Lombardi'', and Anglicized as ''Lombards'').

When Paul the Deacon wrote the ''Historia'' between 787 and 796 he was a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] monk and devoted [[Christianity|Christian]]. He thought the [[Paganism|pagan]] stories of his people "silly" and "laughable".<ref name="PD, VIII"/><ref>Priester, 17</ref> Paul explained that the name "Langobard" came from the length of their beards.<ref>PD, I, 9.</ref> A modern theory suggests that the name "Langobard" comes from ''Langbar<U+00F0>r'', [[List of names of Odin|a name of Odin]].<ref>Pohl and Erhart. Nedoma, 449<U+2013>445.</ref> Priester states that when the Winnili changed their name to "Lombards", they also changed their old agricultural [[fertility cult]] to a cult of Odin, thus creating a conscious tribal tradition.<ref>Priester, 17.</ref> Fr<U+00F6>hlich inverts the order of events in Priester and states that with the Odin cult, the Lombards grew their beards in resemblance of the Odin of tradition and their new name reflected this.<ref>Fr<U+00F6>hlich, 19.</ref> Bruckner remarks that the name of the Lombards stands in close relation to the worship of Odin, [[List of names of Odin|whose many names]] include "the Long-bearded" or "the Grey-bearded", and that the Lombard given name ''Ansegranus'' ("he with the beard of the gods") shows that the Lombards had this idea of their chief deity.<ref>Bruckner, 30<U+2013>33.</ref>

====Archaeology and migrations====

[[File:Long555.PNG|thumb|250px|Distribution of Langobardic burial fields at the [[Unterelbe|Lower Elbe]] Lands (according to W. Wegewitz)]]

The first mention of the Lombards occurred between AD 9 and 16, by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] court historian [[Velleius Paterculus]], who accompanied a Roman expedition as prefect of the cavalry.<ref name="Menghin, 15"/> Paterculus says that under [[Tiberius]] the "power of the Langobardi was broken, a race surpassing even the Germans in savagery".<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2D*.html#ref:Langobardi Velleius, Hist. Rom. II, 106.] Schmidt, 5.</ref>

From the combined testimony of [[Strabo]] (AD 20) and [[Tacitus]] (AD 117), the Lombards dwelt near the mouth of the [[Elbe]] shortly after the beginning of the Christian era, next to the [[Chauci]].<ref name="Menghin, 15">Menghin, 15.</ref> Strabo states that the Lombards dwelt on both sides of the Elbe.<ref>Menghin, 15.</ref> He treats them as a branch of the [[Suebi]], and states that:

<blockquote>Now as for the tribe of the Suebi, it is the largest, for it extends from the Rhenus to the Albis; and a part of them even dwell on the far side of the Albis, as, for instance, the Hermondori and the Langobardi; and at the present time these latter, at least, have, to the last man, been driven in flight out of their country into the land on the far side of the river.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0198:book=7:chapter=1&highlight=langobardi Strabo, VII, 1, 3.]</ref></blockquote>

The German archaeologist Willi Wegewitz defined several [[Iron Age]] burial sites at the [[Unterelbe|Lower Elbe]] as ''Langobardic''.<ref>Wegewitz, ''Das langobardische Brandgr<U+00E4>berfeld von Putensen, Kreis Harburg'' (1972), 1<U+2013>29. ''Problemi della civilita e dell'economia Longobarda'', Milan (1964), 19ff.</ref> The burial sites are crematorial and are usually dated from the 6th century BC through the 3rd century AD, so a settlement breakoff seems unlikely.<ref>Menghin, 17.</ref> The lands of the lower Elbe fall into the zone of the [[Jastorf Culture]] and became [[Elbe-Germans|Elbe-Germanic]], differing from the lands between [[Rhine]], [[Weser]], and the [[North Sea]].<ref>Menghin, 18.</ref> Archaeological finds show that the Lombards were an agricultural people.<ref>Priester, 18.</ref>

[[Tacitus]] also counted the Lombards as a remote and aggressive [[Suebi]]an tribe, one of those united in worship of the deity [[Nerthus]], who he referred to as "Mother Earth", and also as subjects of [[Marbod|Marobod]] the King of the [[Marcomanni]].<ref name="Tacitus, Ann. II, 45">Tacitus, Ann. II, 45.</ref> Marobod had made peace with the Romans, and that is why the Lombards were not part of the Germanic confederacy under [[Arminius]] at the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]] in AD 9. In AD 17, war broke out between Arminius and Marobod. Tacitus records:

{{quote|Not only the Cheruscans and their confederates... took arms, but the Semnones and Langobards, both Suebian nations, revolted to him from the sovereignty of Marobod... The armies... were stimulated by reasons of their own, the Cheruscans and the Langobards fought for their ancient honor or their newly acquired independence. . . "''<ref name="Tacitus, Ann. II, 45"/> }}

In 47, a struggle ensued amongst the [[Cherusci]] and they expelled their new leader, the nephew of Arminius, from their country. The Lombards appeared on the scene with sufficient power to control the destiny of the tribe that had been the leader in the struggle for independence thirty-eight years earlier, for they restored the deposed leader to sovereignty again.<ref>Tacitus, Annals, XI, 16, 17.</ref>

[[File:Lombard Migration.jpg|thumb|left|Lombard migration from [[Scandinavia]]]]

To the south, [[Cassius Dio]] reported that just before the [[Marcomannic Wars]], 6,000 Lombards and Obii (sometimes thought to be [[Ubii]]), crossed the [[Danube]] and invaded [[Pannonia]].<ref>Cassius Dio, 71, 3, 1. Menghin 16.</ref> The two tribes were defeated, whereupon they ceased their invasion and sent Ballomar, King of the Marcomanni, as ambassador to [[Aelius Bassus]], who was then administering Pannonia. Peace was made and the two tribes returned to their homes, which in the case of the Lombards was the lands of the lower Elbe.<ref>Priester, 21. Zeuss, 471. Wiese, 38. Schmidt, 35<U+2013>36.</ref> At about this time, in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' Tacitus says that "their scanty numbers are a distinction" because "surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes, they are safe, not by submitting, but by daring the perils of war".<ref>Tacitus, Germania, 38-40</ref>

In the mid-2nd century, the Lombards apparently appeared in the [[Rhineland]], because according to [[Claudius Ptolemy]], the Suebic Lombards lived "below" the [[Bructeri]] and [[Sugambri]], and between these and the [[Tencteri]]. To their east stretching northwards to the central Elbe are the Suebi [[Angili]].<ref>Ptolemy, Geogr. II, 11, 9. Menghin, 15.</ref> But Ptolemy also mentions the "Laccobardi" to the north of the above-mentioned Suebic territories, east of the [[Angrivarii]] on the [[Weser]], and south of the [[Chauci]] on the coast, probably indicating a Lombard expansion from the Elbe to the Rhine.<ref>Ptolemy, Geogr. II, 11, 17. Menghin, 15</ref> This double mention has been interpreted as an editorial error by Gudmund Sch<U+00FC>tte, in his analysis of Ptolemy.<ref>Sch<U+00FC>tte, ''Ptolemy's Maps of Northern Europe'', pages [http://archive.org/stream/ptolemysmapsofno00schrich#page/34/mode/2up/search/angles 34], and [http://archive.org/stream/ptolemysmapsofno00schrich#page/118/mode/2up/search/angles 118]</ref> However, the ''Codex Gothanus'' also mentions ''Patespruna'' ([[Paderborn]]) in connection with the Lombards.<ref>Codex Gothanus, II.</ref>

From the 2nd century onwards, many of the Germanic tribes recorded as active during the Principate started to unite into bigger tribal unions, such as the [[Franks]], [[Alamanni]], [[Bavarii]], and [[Saxons]].<ref name="Priester, 14. Menghin, 16">Priester, 14. Menghin, 16.</ref> The Lombards are not mentioned at first, perhaps because they were not initially on the border of Rome, or perhaps because they were subjected to a larger tribal union, like the Saxons.<ref name="Priester, 14. Menghin, 16"/> It is, however, highly probable that, when the bulk of the Lombards migrated, a considerable part remained behind and afterwards became absorbed by the Saxon tribes in the Elbe region, while the emigrants alone retained the name of Lombards.<ref>Hartmann, II, pt I, 5.</ref> However, the ''Codex Gothanus'' states that the Lombards were subjected by the Saxons around 300 but rose up against them under their first king, Agelmund, who ruled for 30 years.<ref>Menghin, 17, 19. Codex Gothanus, II.</ref> In the second half of the 4th century, the Lombards left their homes, probably due to bad harvests, and embarked on their migration.<ref>Zeuss, 471. Wiese, 38. Schmidt, 35<U+2013>36. Priester, 21<U+2013>22. ''HGL'', X.</ref>

[[File:Lombard state 526.png|thumb|250px|The Lombard state in [[Slovakia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], and [[Austria]] in 526.]]

The migration route of the Lombards in 489, from their homeland to "Rugiland", encompassed several places: ''Scoringa'' (believed to be the their land on the Elbe shores), ''Mauringa'', ''Golanda'', ''Anthaib'', ''Banthaib'', and ''Vurgundaib'' (''Burgundaib'').<ref>Hammerstein-Loxton, 56. Bluhme. ''HGL'', XIII.</ref> According to the [[Ravenna Cosmography]], Mauringa was the land east of the Elbe.<ref>Cosmographer of Ravenna, I, 11.</ref>

The crossing into Mauringa was very difficult. The Assipitti (possibly the Usipetes) denied them passage through their lands and a fight was arranged for the strongest man of each tribe. The Lombard was victorious, passage was granted, and the Lombards reached Mauringa.<ref>Hodgkin, Ch. V, 92. ''HGL'', XII.</ref>

The Lombards departed from Mauringa and reached Golanda. Scholar Ludwig Schmidt thinks this was further east, perhaps on the right bank of the [[Oder]].<ref>Schmidt, 49.</ref> Schmidt considers the name the equivalent of [[Gotland]], meaning simply "good land."<ref>Hodgkin, V, 143.</ref> This theory is highly plausible; [[Paul the Deacon]] mentions the Lombards crossing a river, and they could have reached ''Rugiland'' from the Upper Oder area via the [[Moravian-Silesian Region|Moravian Gate]].<ref>Menghin, ''Das Reich an der Donau'', 21.</ref>

Moving out of Golanda, the Lombards passed through Anthaib and Banthaib until they reached Vurgundaib, believed to be the old lands of the [[Burgundes]].<ref>K. Priester, 22.</ref><ref>Bluhme, Gens Langobardorum Bonn, 1868</ref> In Vurgundaib, the Lombards were stormed in camp by "[[Bulgars]]" (probably [[Huns]])<ref>Menghin, 14.</ref> and were defeated; King Agelmund was killed and Laimicho was made king. He was in his youth and desired to avenge the slaughter of Agelmund.<ref>Hist. gentis Lang., Ch. XVII</ref> The Lombards themselves were probably made subjects of the Huns after the defeat but rose up and defeated them with great slaughter,<ref>Hist. gentis Lang., Ch. XVII.</ref> gaining great booty and confidence as they "became bolder in undertaking the toils of war."<ref>PD, XVII.</ref>

In the 540s, [[Audoin]] (ruled 546<U+2013>560) led the Lombards across the Danube once more into [[Pannonia]], where they received Imperial subsidies as [[Justinian]] encouraged them to battle the [[Gepids]].

===Kingdom in Italy, 568<U+2013>774===
{{Main|Kingdom of the Lombards}}

====Invasion and conquest of the Italian peninsula====
In 560, Audoin was succeeded by his son [[Alboin]], a young and energetic leader who defeated the neighboring [[Gepidae]] and made them his subjects; in 566, he married [[Rosamund (Lombard)|Rosamund]], daughter of the Gepid king [[Cunimund]]. In the spring of 568, Alboin led the Lombard migration into [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]]:<ref name=HGL>{{cite book|title=History of the Lombards: Translated by William Dudley Foulke |first=Edward |last=Peters |year=2003 |place=University of Pennsylvania Press}}</ref>

{{quote|''"Then the Langobards, having left [[Pannonia]], hastened to take possession of [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]] with their wives and children and all their goods." B.2-Ch.7''}}

Various other people who either voluntarily joined or were subjects of [[Alboin|King Alboin]] were also part of the migration:<ref name=HGL/>

{{quote|''"Whence, even until today, we call the villages in which they dwell [[Gepids|Gepidan]], [[Bulgars|Bulgarian]], [[Sarmatian]], [[Pannonian]], [[Suebi|Suabian]], [[Norican]], or by other names of this kind." B.2-Ch.26''}}

The first important city to fall was ''Forum Iulii'' ([[Cividale del Friuli]]) in [[northeast Italy|northeastern Italy]], in 569. There, Alboin created the first Lombard duchy, which he entrusted to his nephew [[Gisulf II of Friuli|Gisulf]]. Soon [[Vicenza]], [[Verona]] and [[Brescia]] fell into Germanic hands. In the summer of 569, the Lombards conquered the main Roman centre of [[northern Italy]], [[Milan]]. The area was then recovering from the terrible [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>552)|Gothic Wars]], and the small [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] army left for its defence could do almost nothing. The [[Exarch]] sent to Italy by Emperor [[Justin II]], Longinus, could only defend coastal cities that could be supplied by the powerful Byzantine fleet. [[Pavia]] fell after a siege of three years, in 572, becoming the first capital city of the new Lombard kingdom of Italy. In the following years, the Lombards penetrated further south, conquering [[Tuscany]] and establishing two duchies, [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] and [[Duchy of Benevento|Benevento]] under [[Zotto]], which soon became semi-independent and even outlasted the northern kingdom, surviving well into the 12th century. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] managed to retain control of the area of Ravenna and Rome, linked by a thin corridor running through [[Perugia]].

When they entered Italy, some Lombards retained their native form of [[Germanic paganism|paganism]], while some were [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians. Hence they did not enjoy good relations with the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]]. Gradually, they adopted Roman titles, names, and traditions, and partially converted to orthodoxy (in the 7th century), though not without a long series of religious and ethnic conflicts. By the time [[Paul the Deacon]] was writing, the Lombard language, dress and even hairstyles had all disappeared.<ref>"The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 500-c. 700" by Paul Fouracre and Rosamond McKitterick (page 8)</ref>

The whole Lombard territory was divided into 36 duchies, whose leaders settled in the main cities. The king ruled over them and administered the land through emissaries called ''gastaldi''. This subdivision, however, together with the independent indocility of the duchies, deprived the kingdom of unity, making it weak even when compared to the Byzantines, especially after they began to recover from the initial invasion. This weakness became even more evident when the Lombards had to face the increasing power of the Franks. In response, the kings tried to centralize power over time, but they definitively lost control over [[Spoleto]] and [[Benevento]] in the attempt.

====Arian monarchy====
[[File:Chlothar II.jpg|thumb|The Frankish [[Merovingian]] King [[Chlothar II]] in combat with the Lombards]]
In 572, Alboin was murdered in Verona in a plot led by his wife, Rosamund, who later fled to [[Ravenna]]. His successor, [[Cleph]], was also assassinated, after a ruthless reign of 18 months. His death began an interregnum of years (the "[[Rule of the Dukes]]") during which the [[Duke (Lombard)|duke]]s did not elect any king, a period regarded as a time of violence and disorder. In 584, threatened by a Frankish invasion, the dukes elected as king Cleph's son, [[Authari]]. In 589, he married [[Theodelinda]], daughter of [[Garibald I of Bavaria]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]]. The Catholic Theodelinda was a friend of [[Pope Gregory I]] and pushed for Christianization. In the meantime, Authari embarked on a policy of internal reconciliation and tried to reorganize royal administration. The dukes yielded half their estates for the maintenance of the king and his court in Pavia. On the foreign affairs side, Authari managed to thwart the dangerous alliance between the Byzantines and the Franks.

Authari died in 591 and was succeeded by [[Agilulf]], the duke of [[Turin]], who also married Theodelinda in the same year. Agilulf successfully fought the rebel dukes of northern Italy, conquering [[Padua]] in 601, [[Cremona]] and [[Mantua]] in 603, and forcing the [[Exarch of Ravenna]] to pay tribute. Agilulf died in 616; Theodelinda reigned alone until 628 when she was succeeded by [[Adaloald]]. [[Arioald]], the head of the Arian opposition who had married Theodelinda's daughter Gundeperga, later deposed Adaloald.

Arioald was succeeded by [[Rothari]], regarded by many authorities as the most energetic of all Lombard kings. He extended his dominions, conquering [[Liguria]] in 643 and the remaining part of the Byzantine territories of inner [[Veneto]], including the Roman city of ''Opitergium'' ([[Oderzo]]). Rothari also made the famous edict bearing his name, the ''[[Edictum Rothari]]'', which established the laws and the customs of his people in [[Latin]]: the edict did not apply to the tributaries of the Lombards, who could retain their own laws. Rothari's son [[Rodoald]] succeeded him in 652, still very young, and was killed by his opponents.

At the death of King [[Aripert I]] in 661, the kingdom was split between his children [[Perctarit]], who set his capital in Milan, and [[Godepert]], who reigned from [[Pavia]] ([[Ticinum]]). Perctarit was overthrown by [[Grimoald I of Benevento|Grimoald]], son of Gisulf, duke of [[Friuli]] and Benevento since 647. Perctarit fled to the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and then to the Franks. Grimoald managed to regain control over the duchies and deflected the late attempt of the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] to conquer southern Italy. He also defeated the Franks. At Grimoald's death in 671 [[Perctarit]] returned and promoted tolerance between Arians and Catholics, but he could not defeat the Arian party, led by Arachi, duke of [[Trento]], who submitted only to his son, the philo-Catholic [[Cunincpert]].

The Lombards engaged in fierce battles with [[Slavic peoples]] during these years: In 623<U+2013>26 the Lombards unsuccessfully attacked [[Carantania]]ns; in 663<U+2013>64, the Slavs raided the [[Vipava Valley]] and the [[Friuli]].

====Catholic monarchy====
[[File:Luitprand tremissis 661673.jpg|thumb|233px|right|[[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|King Liutprand]] - (712-744)<BR>''"was a zealous Catholic, generous and a great founder of monasteries"''<ref name=FEL>{{cite book|title=The End of the Ancient World and the Beginnings of the Middle Ages |first=Ferdinand |last=Lot |year=1931 |place=London}}</ref>]]
Religious strife and the Slavic raids remained a source of struggle in the following years. In 705, the Friuli Lombards were defeated and lost the land to the west of the [[So<U+010D>a]] River, namely the [[Gorizia Hills]] and the [[Venetian Slovenia]].<ref name="VidmarSolkan" /> A new ethnic border was established that has lasted for over 1200 years up until the present time.<ref name="VidmarSolkan">{{cite web |url=http://www.solkan.si/o-solkanu/od-kod-prihajajo-in-kdo-so-solkanski-langobardi |title=Od kod prihajajo in kdo so solkanski Langobardi |language=Slovenian |trans_title=From Where Come and Who Are the Solkan Lombards |first=Jernej |last=Vidmar |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= |title=A Slovene history: society - politics - culture |first=Peter |last=<U+0160>tih |first2=Vasko |last2=Simoniti |first3=Peter |last3=Vodopivec |editor-first=<U+017D>arko |editor-last=Lazarevi<U+0107> |publisher=Institute of Modern History |place=Ljubljana |year=2008 |isbn=978-961-6386-19-7 |chapter=The Settlement of the Slavs |page=22}}</ref>

The Lombard reign began to recover only with [[Liutprand the Lombard]] (king from 712), son of [[Ansprand]] and successor of the brutal [[Aripert II]]. He managed to regain a certain control over [[Spoleto]] and Benevento, and, taking advantage of the disagreements between the Pope and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] concerning the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|reverence of icons]], he annexed the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchy of [[Rome]]. He also helped the Frankish marshal [[Charles Martel]] drive back the [[Arabs]]. The Slavs were defeated in the [[Battle of Lavariano]], when they tried to conquer the [[Friulian Plain]] in 720.<ref name="VidmarSolkan" /> Liutprand's successor [[Aistulf]] conquered Ravenna for the Lombards for the first time but had to relinquish it when he was subsequently defeated by the king of the Franks, [[Pippin III]], who was called by the Pope.

After the death of Aistulf, [[Ratchis]] attempted to become king of Lombardy, but he was deposed by [[Desiderius]], duke of [[Tuscany]], the last Lombard to rule as king. Desiderius managed to take Ravenna definitively, ending the Byzantine presence in northern Italy. He decided to reopen struggles against the Pope, who was supporting the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento against him, and entered Rome in 772, the first Lombard king to do so. But when [[Pope Hadrian I]] called for help from the powerful Frankish king [[Charlemagne]], Desiderius was defeated at [[Susa, Italy|Susa]] and besieged in [[Pavia]], while his son [[Adalgis|Adelchis]] was forced to open the gates of Verona to Frankish troops. Desiderius surrendered in 774, and Charlemagne, in an utterly novel decision, took the title "King of the Lombards". Before then the Germanic kingdoms had frequently conquered each other, but none had adopted the title of King of another people. Charlemagne took part of the Lombard territory to create the [[Papal States]].

The [[Lombardy]] region in Italy, which includes the cities of Brescia, Bergamo, Milan, and the old capital Pavia, is a reminder of the presence of the Lombards.

===Later history===

====United Principality of Benevento, 774<U+2013>849====
[[File:Duchy of Benevento It.svg|thumb|350px|Lombard [[Duchy of Benevento]] in the 8th century]]

Though the kingdom centred on Pavia in the north fell to Charlemagne, the Lombard-controlled territory to the south of the Papal States was never subjugated by Charlemagne or his descendants. In 774, Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]], whose duchy had only nominally been under royal authority, though certain kings had been effective at making their power known in the south, claimed that Benevento was the [[successor state]] of the kingdom. He tried to turn Benevento into a ''secundum Ticinum'': a second Pavia. He tried to claim the kingship, but with no support and no chance of a coronation in Pavia.

Charlemagne came down with an army, and his son [[Louis the Pious]] sent men, to force the Beneventan duke to submit, but his submission and promises were never kept and Arechis and his successors were ''de facto'' independent. The Beneventan dukes took the title ''princeps'' (prince) instead of that of king.

The Lombards of southern Italy were thereafter in the anomalous position of holding land claimed by two empires: the [[Carolingian Empire]] to the north and west and the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the east. They typically made pledges and promises of tribute to the Carolingians, but effectively remained outside Frankish control. Benevento meanwhile grew to its greatest extent yet when it imposed a tribute on the [[Duchy of Naples]], which was tenuously loyal to Byzantium and even conquered the Neapolitan city of [[Amalfi]] in 838. At one point in the reign of [[Sicard of Benevento|Sicard]], Lombard control covered most of southern Italy save the very south of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] and Naples, with its nominally attached cities. It was during the 9th century that a strong Lombard presence became entrenched in formerly Greek Apulia. However, Sicard had opened up the south to the invasive actions of the [[Saracens]] in his war with [[Andrew II of Naples]] and when he was assassinated in 839, Amalfi declared independence and two factions fought for power in Benevento, crippling the principality and making it susceptible to external enemies.

The civil war lasted ten years and ended with a peace treaty imposed in 849 by [[Emperor Louis II]], the only Frankish king to exercise actual sovereignty over the Lombard states. The treaty divided the kingdom into two states: the Principality of Benevento and the [[Principality of Salerno]], with its capital at [[Salerno]] on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].

====Southern Italy and the Arabs, 836<U+2013>915====
{{Main|History of Islam in southern Italy}}
Andrew II of Naples hired Saracen mercenaries for his war with Sicard of Benevento in 836; Sicard responded with other Muslim mercenaries. The Saracens initially concentrated their attacks on [[Sicily]] and Byzantine Italy, but soon [[Radelchis I of Benevento]] called in more mercenaries, who destroyed [[Capua]] in 841. [[Landulf I of Capua|Landulf the Old]] founded the present-day Capua, "New Capua", on a nearby hill. In general, the Lombard princes were less inclined to ally with the Saracens than with their Greek neighbours of Amalfi, Gaeta, Naples, and Sorrento. [[Guaifer of Salerno]], however, briefly put himself under Muslim suzerainty.

In 847 a large Muslim force seized [[Bari]], until then a Lombard gastaldate under the control of [[Pandenulf of Bari|Pandenulf]]. Saracen incursions proceeded northwards until [[Adelchis of Benevento]] sought the help of his suzerain, Louis II, who allied with the Byzantine emperor [[Basil I]] to expel the Arabs from Bari in 869. An Arab landing force was defeated by the emperor in 871. Adelchis and Louis remained at war until the death of Louis in 875. Adelchis regarded himself as the true successor of the Lombard kings, and in that capacity he amended the ''[[Edictum Rothari]]'', the last Lombard ruler to do so.

After the death of Louis, [[Landulf II of Capua]] briefly flirted with a Saracen alliance, but [[Pope John VIII]] convinced him to break it off. [[Guaimar I of Salerno]] fought the Saracens with Byzantine troops. Throughout this period the Lombard princes swung in allegiance from one party to another. Finally, towards 915, [[Pope John X]] managed to unite the Christian princes of southern Italy against the Saracen establishments on the [[Garigliano]] river. The Saracens were ousted from Italy in the [[Battle of the Garigliano]] in 915.

====The Lombard principalities in the 10th century====
[[File:Italy 1000 AD.svg|thumb|250px|right|Italy around the turn of the millennium, showing the Lombard states in the south on the eve of the arrival of the Normans.]]

The independent state of Salerno inspired the [[prince of Capua|gastalds of Capua]] to move towards independence, and by the end of the century they were styling themselves "princes" and as a third Lombard state. The Capuan and Beneventan states were united by [[Atenulf I of Capua]] in 900. He subsequently declared them to be in perpetual union, and they were separated only in 982, on the death of [[Pandulf Ironhead]]. With all of the Lombard south under his control, except Salerno, Atenulf felt safe to use the title ''princeps gentis Langobardorum'' ("prince of the Lombard people"), which Arechis II had begun using in 774. Among Atenulf's successors the principality was ruled jointly by fathers, sons, brothers, cousins, and uncles for the greater part of the century. Meanwhile, the prince [[Gisulf I of Salerno]] began using the title ''Langobardorum gentis princeps'' around mid-century, but the ideal of a united Lombard principality was realised only in December 977, when Gisulf died and his domains were inherited by Pandulf Ironhead, who temporarily held almost all Italy south of Rome and brought the Lombards into alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His territories were divided upon his death.

[[Landulf II of Benevento|Landulf the Red]] of Benevento and Capua tried to conquer the principality of Salerno with the help of [[John III of Naples]], but with the aid of [[Mastalus I of Amalfi]], Gisulf repulsed him. The rulers of Benevento and Capua made several attempts on [[Catapanate of Italy|Byzantine Apulia]] at this time, but late in the century, the Byzantines, under the stiff rule of [[Basil II]], gained ground on the Lombards.

The principal source for the history of the Lombard principalities in this period is the ''[[Chronicon Salernitanum]]'', composed late in the 10th century at Salerno.

====Norman conquest, 1017<U+2013>1078====
{{Main|Norman conquest of southern Italy}}
The diminished Beneventan principality soon lost its independence to the [[papacy]] and declined in importance until it fell in the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]]. The Normans, first called in by the Lombards to fight the Byzantines for control of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] (under the likes of [[Melus of Bari]] and [[Arduin the Lombard|Arduin]], among others), had become rivals for hegemony in the south. The Salernitan principality experienced a golden age under [[Guaimar III of Salerno|Guaimar III]] and [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]], but under [[Gisulf II of Salerno|Gisulf II]], the principality shrank to insignificance and fell in 1078 to [[Robert Guiscard]], who had married Gisulf's sister [[Sichelgaita]]. The Capua principality was hotly contested during the reign of the hated [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf IV]], the ''Wolf of the Abruzzi'', and, under his son, it fell, almost without contest, to the Norman [[Richard I of Aversa|Richard Drengot]] (1058). The Capuans revolted against Norman rule in 1091, expelling Richard's grandson [[Richard II of Capua|Richard II]] and setting up one [[Lando IV of Capua|Lando IV]].

Capua was again put under Norman rule after the [[Siege of Capua]] of 1098 and the city quickly declined in importance under a series of ineffectual Norman rulers. The independent status of these Lombard states is in general attested by the ability of their rulers to switch suzerains at will. Often the legal vassal of pope or emperor (either Byzantine or [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman]]), they were the real power-brokers in the south until their erstwhile allies, the Normans, rose to preeminence: The Lombards regarded the Normans as barbarians and the Byzantines as oppressors. Regarding their own civilisation as superior, the Lombards did indeed provide the environment for the illustrious [[Schola Medica Salernitana]].

==Culture==

===Language===
{{Main|Lombardic language}}
The [[Lombardic language]] is extinct (unless [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]] and [[Mocheno]] represent surviving dialects).<ref name=BKM>{{cite book|title=The Languages and Linguistics of Europe: Vol.II |first=Bernd |last=Kortmann |year=2011 |place=Berlin}}</ref> The [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] declined beginning in the 7th century, but may have been in scattered use until as late as about the year 1000. The language is preserved only fragmentarily, the main evidence being individual words quoted in [[Latin]] texts. In the absence of Lombardic texts, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the language's morphology and syntax. The genetic classification of the language is based entirely on phonology. Since there is evidence that Lombardic participated in, and indeed shows some of the earliest evidence for, the [[High German consonant shift]], it is classified as an [[Elbe Germanic]] or [[Upper German]] dialect.

Lombardic fragments are preserved in [[rune|runic]] inscriptions. Among the primary source texts are short inscriptions in the [[Elder Futhark]], among them the "bronze capsule of [[Schretzheim]]" (c. 600). There are a number of Latin texts that include Lombardic names, and Lombardic legal texts contain terms taken from the legal vocabulary of the vernacular. In 2005, there were claims that the inscription of the [[Pernik sword]] may be Lombardic.

The Italian language preserves a large number of Lombardic words, although it is not always easy to distinguish them from other Germanic languages such as Gothic and Frankish. They often bear some resemblance to English words, as Lombardic was akin to Saxon. For instance, ''landa'' from ''land'', ''guardia'' from ''wardan'' (warden), ''guerra'' from ''werra'' (war), and ''guadare'' from ''wadjan'' (to wade).

===Social structure===

====Migration Period society====
The Lombard kings can be traced back as early as c. 380 and thus to the beginning of the Great Migration. Kingship developed amongst the Germanic peoples when the unity of a single military command was found necessary. Schmidt believed that the Germanic tribes were divided according to [[canton (country subdivision)|cantons]] and that the earliest government was a general assembly that selected canton chiefs and war leaders in times of conflict. All such figures were probably selected from a caste of nobility. As a result of the wars of their wanderings, royal power developed such that the king became the representative of the people, but the influence of the people on the government did not fully disappear.<ref>Schmidt, 76<U+2013>77.</ref> Paul the Deacon gives an account of the Lombard tribal structure during the migration:
<blockquote>
. . . in order that they might increase the number of their warriors, [the Lombards] confer liberty upon many whom they deliver from the yoke of bondage, and that the freedom of these may be regarded as established, they confirm it in their accustomed way by an arrow, uttering certain words of their country in confirmation of the fact.
</blockquote>
Complete emancipation appears to have been granted only among the Franks and the Lombards.<ref>Schmidt, 47 n3.</ref>

====Society of the Catholic kingdom====
{{See also|Duke (Lombard)}}
Lombard society was divided into classes comparable to those found in the other Germanic successor states of Rome, [[Frankish Empire|Frankish Gaul]] and [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania|Spain]]. There was a noble class, a class of free persons beneath them, a class of unfree non-slaves (serfs), and finally slaves. The aristocracy itself was poorer, more urbanised, and less landed than elsewhere. Aside from the richest and most powerful of the dukes and the king himself, Lombard noblemen tended to live in cities (unlike their Frankish counterparts) and hold little more than twice as much in land as the merchant class (a far cry from provincial Frankish aristocrats who held vast swathes of land, hundreds of times larger than those beneath his status). The aristocracy by the 8th century was highly dependent on the king for means of income related especially to judicial duties: many Lombard nobles are referred to in contemporary documents as ''iudices'' (judges) even when their offices had important military and legislative functions as well.

The freemen of the Lombard kingdom were far more numerous than in Frank lands, especially in the 8th century, when they are almost invisible in surviving documentary evidence. Smallholders, owner-cultivators, and rentiers are the most numerous types of person in surviving diplomata for the Lombard kingdom. They may have owned more than half of the land in Lombard Italy. The freemen were ''exercitales'' and ''viri devoti'', that is, soldiers and "devoted men" (a military term like "retainers"); they formed the [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levy]] of the Lombard army, and they were sometimes, if infrequently, called to serve, though this seems not to have been their preference. The small landed class, however, lacked the political influence necessary with the king (and the dukes) to control the politics and legislation of the kingdom. The aristocracy was more thoroughly powerful politically if not economically in Italy than in contemporary Gaul and Spain.

The urbanisation of Lombard Italy was characterised by the ''citt<U+00E0> ad isole'' (or "city as islands"). It appears from archaeology that the great cities of Lombard Italy <U+2014> [[Pavia]], [[Lucca]], [[Siena]], [[Arezzo]], [[Milan]] <U+2014> were themselves formed of minute islands of urbanisation within the old Roman city walls. The cities of the Roman Empire had been partially destroyed in the series of wars of the 5th and 6th centuries. Many sectors were left in ruins and ancient monuments became fields of grass used as pastures for animals, thus the [[Roman Forum]] became the ''Campo Vaccino'', the field of cows. The portions of the cities that remained intact were small, modest, contained a cathedral or major church (often sumptuously decorated), and a few public buildings and townhomes of the aristocracy. Few buildings of importance were stone, most were wood. In the end, the inhabited parts of the cities were separated from one another by stretches of pasture even within the city walls.

===Religious history===

====Paganism====

[[Barbatus of Benevento|St. Barbatus]] of [[Benevento]] observed many pagan rituals and traditions amongst the Lombards authorised by the [[Romuald I of Benvento|Duke Romuald]], son of [[Grimoald I of Benevento|King Grimoald]]:<ref name=RAB>{{cite book|title=The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints: Vol.I |first=Alban |last=Rev. Butler |year=1866 |place=London}}</ref><BR>
	
{{quote|''"They expressed a religious veneration to a golden viper, and prostrated themselves before it: they paid also a superstitious honour to a tree, on which they hung the skin of a wild beast, and these ceremonies were closed by public games, in which the skin served for a mark at which bowmen shot arrows over their shoulder."''}}

====Christianisation====
The Lombards were first touched by Christianity while still in Pannonia, but only touched: Their conversion and Christianisation was largely nominal and far from complete. During the reign of [[Wacho]], they were [[Roman Catholic]]s allied with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but [[Alboin]] converted to [[Arianism]] as an ally of the [[Ostrogoths]] and invaded Italy. All these Christian conversions primarily affected the aristocracy, while the common people remained pagan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In Italy, the Lombards were intensively Christianised, and the pressure to convert to Catholicism was great. With the Bavarian queen [[Theodelinda]], a Catholic, the monarchy was brought under heavy Catholic influence. After initial support for the anti-Rome party in the [[Schism of the Three Chapters]], Theodelinda remained a close contact and supporter of [[Pope Gregory I]]. In 603, [[Adaloald]], the heir to the throne, received a Catholic baptism. During the next century, Arianism and paganism continued to hold out in [[Austria (Lombard)|Austria]] (the northeast of Italy) and in the Duchy of Benevento. A succession of Arian kings were militarily aggressive and presented a threat to the Papacy in Rome. In the 7th century, the nominally Christian aristocracy of Benevento was still practising pagan rituals, such as sacrifices in "sacred" woods. By the end of the reign of [[Cunincpert]], however, the Lombards were more or less completely Catholicised. Under [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]], the Catholicism became tangible, as the king sought to justify his title ''rex totius Italiae'' by uniting the south of the peninsula with the north and bringing together his Italo-Roman and Germanic subjects into one Catholic state.

====Beneventan Christianity====
[[File:Beneventan.jpeg|thumb|The [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] in Beneventan (i.e. Lombard) script]]

The Duchy and eventually Principality of Benevento in southern Italy developed a unique Christian [[rite]] in the 7th and 8th centuries. The Beneventan rite is more closely related to the liturgy of the [[Ambrosian rite]] than to the [[Roman rite]]. The Beneventan rite has not survived in its complete form, although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of local significance are extant. The Beneventan rite appears to have been less complete, less systematic, and more liturgically flexible than the Roman rite.

Characteristic of this rite was the [[Beneventan chant]], a Lombard-influenced chant that bore similarities to the [[Ambrosian chant]] of Lombard Milan. The Beneventan chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Beneventan rite; many Beneventan chants were assigned multiple roles when inserted into Gregorian chantbooks, appearing variously as antiphons, offertories, and communions, for example. It was eventually supplanted by the [[Gregorian chant]] in the 11th century.

The chief centre of the Beneventan chant was [[Montecassino]], one of the first and greatest abbeys of [[Western monasticism]]. [[Gisulf II of Benevento]] had donated a large swathe of land to Montecassino in 744, and that became the basis for an important state, the ''[[Terra Sancti Benedicti]]'', which was a subject only to Rome. The Cassinese influence on Christianity in southern Italy was immense. Montecassino was also the starting point for another characteristic of Beneventan monasticism, the use of the distinct [[Beneventan script]], a clear, angular script derived from the [[Roman cursive]] as used by the Lombards.

===Art and architecture===
During their nomadic phase, the Lombards primarily created art that was easily carried with them, like arms and jewellery. Though relatively little of this has survived, it bears resemblance to the similar endeavours of other Germanic tribes of northern and central Europe from the same era.

The first major modifications to the Germanic style of the Lombards came in Pannonia and especially in Italy, under the influence of local, [[Byzantine art and architecture|Byzantine]], and [[early Christian art and architecture|Christian]] styles. The conversions from nomadism and paganism to settlement and Christianity also opened up new arenas of artistic expression, such as architecture (especially churches) and its accompanying decorative arts (such as frescoes).

====Architecture====
{{main|Lombard architecture}}
[[File:Fara Gera d'Adda3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The ''Basilic autariana'' in [[Fara Gera d'Adda]]]]

Few Lombard buildings have survived. Most have been lost, rebuilt, or renovated at some point, so they preserve little of their original Lombard structure. Lombard architecture was well-studied in the 20th century, and the four-volume ''Lombard Architecture'' (1919) by [[Arthur Kingsley Porter]] is a "monument of illustrated history".

The small [[Oratorio di Santa Maria in Valle]] in [[Cividale del Friuli]] is probably one of the oldest preserved examples of Lombard architecture, as Cividale was the first Lombard city in Italy. Parts of Lombard constructions have been preserved in [[Pavia]] ([[San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro]], crypts of [[Sant'Eusebio]] and [[San Giovanni Domnarum]]) and [[Monza]] ([[Cathedral of Monza|cathedral]]). The ''Basilic autariana'' in [[Fara Gera d'Adda]] near [[Bergamo]] and the church of San Salvatore in [[Brescia]] also have Lombard elements. All these buildings are in northern Italy (Langobardia major), but by far the best-preserved Lombard structure is in southern Italy (Langobardia minor). The [[Santa Sofia, Benevento|Church of Santa Sofia]] in [[Benevento]] was erected in 760 by [[Arechis II of Benevento|Duke Arechis II]], and it preserves Lombard frescoes on the walls and even Lombard capitals on the columns.

Lombard architecture flourished under the impulse provided by the Catholic monarchs like [[Theodelinda]], [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]], and [[Desiderius]] to the foundation of monasteries to further their political control. [[Bobbio Abbey]] was founded during this time.

Some of the late Lombard structures of the 9th and 10th centuries have been found to contain elements of style associated with [[Romanesque architecture]] and have been so dubbed "[[first Romanesque]]". These edifices are considered, along with some similar buildings in [[southern France]] and [[Catalonia]], to mark a transitory phase between the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] and full-fledged Romanesque.
