'''Fishbourne Roman Palace''', in the village of [[Fishbourne%2C_West_Sussex|Fishbourne]] in [[West Sussex]], is one of the most important [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites in [[England]]. 

==History==
[[Image:Fishbourne_roman_palace_mosaics.jpeg|thumb|Mosaics at Fishbourne Roman Palace]]
Although local people had known of the existence of Roman remains in the area, it was not until [[1960]] that the archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]] first systematically excavated the site, which had been accidentally uncovered by workmen when a water main was being laid.
The [[Roman villa]] excavated by Cunliffe's team was so large that it became known as Fishbourne Roman Palace, and a museum was erected to protect and preserve some of the remains ''in situ''. This is administered by the [[Sussex Archaeological Society]]. Although due to new finds, there are new theories arising to what may have been built here.

The palace consisted of four large wings with [[colonnade|colonnaded]] fronts, forming a square around a formal garden. The north and east wings consisted of suites of rooms built around courtyards, with a monumental entrance in the middle of the east wing. In the north-east corner was an aisled assembly hall. The west wing contained state rooms, a large ceremonial reception room, and a gallery. The south wing contained the owner's private apartments. The palace also included as many as 50 [[mosaic]] floors, [[Hypocaust|under-floor central heating]] and an integral bathhouse. In size, it is approximately equivalent to [[Nero]]'s [[Golden House]] in [[Rome]] or to the [[Roman villa]] at [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]], and is by far the largest Roman residence known north of the [[Alps]]. At about 500 feet (150 metres) square, it is comparable in size to [[Buckingham Palace]].

A modern museum has been built, incorporating most of the visible remains including one wing of the palace. The gardens have been re-planted using authentic plants from the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. A team of volunteers and professional archaeologists are involved in a continuing research excavation on the site of nearby, possibly military, buildings. The last dig in 2002 produced some interesting results, and the final report is eagerly awaited.

The first buildings on the site were [[granary|granaries]], apparently a supply base for the Roman army, constructed in the early part of the [[Roman invasion of Britain|conquest]] ([[43]]). Later, two timber-frame buildings were constructed, one with clay and mortar floors and plaster walls which appears to have been a dwelling house of some comfort. These buildings were demolished in the [[60]]s and replaced by a substantial stone-walled house, which included a courtyard garden with colonnades and a bath suite. The palace itself, incorporating the previous house in its south-east corner, was begun ca. [[73]].

The most widely accepted theory, proposed by Professor Cunliffe, is that the palace was the residence of [[Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus]] or [[Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus|Togidubnus]], a pro-Roman local chieftain who was installed as king of a number of territories following the first stage of the conquest. Cogidubnus is known from a reference to his loyalty in [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', and from an inscribed altar found in nearby [[Chichester]]. Another theory is that it was built for [[Sallustius Lucullus]], a Roman governor of Britain of the late 1st century who may have been the son of the British prince [[Adminius]].

The palace outlasted Cogidubnus and was extensively re-planned in the [[2nd century]]. Further redevelopment was begun in the late [[3rd century]], but these alterations were left incomplete when the north wing was destroyed in a fire in 270. The damage was too great to repair, and the palace was abandoned and later dismantled.The dismantled parts were reused in the constructions of other buildings in the surrounding area.
