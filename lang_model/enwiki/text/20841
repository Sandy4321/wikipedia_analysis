'''La Quinta Estaci<U+00F3>n''' (Spanish for "The Fifth Season", a play on there being only four [[season]]s of the year, hence La Quinta Estaci<U+00F3>n; often spelled '''La 5<U+00AA> Estaci<U+00F3>n''') were a Spanish [[pop/rock]] band composed of two musicians from [[Madrid]]: [[Natalia Jim<U+00E9>nez]] (lead singer and harmonica) and <U+00C1>ngel Reyero (guitar). Pablo Dom<U+00ED>nguez (2001<U+2013>2008) (guitar and bass) was the third member until his recent split (Now in Varsovia). The band originated in Madrid with six members but the remaining three relocated to Mexico in 2001 after recording their first album ''Primera toma'' ("Take #1").

==Career in Mexico==
The first album of La Quinta Estaci<U+00F3>n became popular in Mexico because one of the songs (''<U+00BF>D<U+00F3>nde Ir<U+00E1>n?'', "Where will they go?") was chosen as [[theme song]] for ''[[Clase 406]]'', one of the most popular [[telenovela]]s of [[Televisa]] in 2002. After touring the country to promote their album, they decided to stay permanently. In the same year, they performed ''Voy a pas<U+00E1>rmelo bien'' ("I'm going to have a good time") in the tribute-album to [[Hombres G]] and ''Si yo fuera mujer'' ("If I were a woman") for the soundtrack of ''[[Dame tu cuerpo]]'', a [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] starred by [[Rafael S<U+00E1>nchez Navarro]] and [[Luis Mar<U+00ED>a Zetina]].

In February 2004, the band released their second album ''Flores de Alquiler'' ("Leased Flowers") produced entirely in Mexico. The first single was ''El Sol No Regresa'' ("The Sun Doesn't Return") a rock song that begins with [[mariachi]] trumpets. This song talks about someone who attempts to drink away their heartbreak. The title line of the chorus translates to, "after several [[tequila]]s, the clouds go away but the sun doesn't come back". This song, as said by the band, is a tribute they made to Mexican people for being the start point of their careers.

Their second single ''Algo M<U+00E1>s'' ("Something More", written by Natalia) talks about a feeling the author says is not love but it is "something more" that fulfills her and it is stronger than "distance, pain and nostalgia". The video for this song was recorded at a bar in the [[Centro Hist<U+00F3>rico de la Ciudad de M<U+00E9>xico|Historic District]] of [[Mexico City]].<ref name="Higuera">{{es icon}}[http://www.lahiguera.net/musicalia/artistas/la_5a_estacion/disco/1465/ ''Flores de alguiler''] Retrieved from lahiguera.net on February 11, 2006</ref>

The video was directed by [[Alejandro Hern<U+00E1>ndez (director)|Alejandro Hern<U+00E1>ndez]], who also directed the video for ''El Sol No Regresa'' and its photography is in black and white.

"Ni<U+00F1>a" ("Girl") was the latest single of the album. The video was quite controversial and also made it to the VH1's chart. This single was quite successful on Mexican radio. According to the band, this song was written for a handicapped girl.
