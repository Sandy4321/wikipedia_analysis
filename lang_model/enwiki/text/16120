==Design==

===Block chain===
The ''block chain'' is a public [[ledger]] that records bitcoin transactions. A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority: maintenance of the block chain is performed by a [[computer network|network]] of communicating [[node (networking)|nodes]] running bitcoin software.<ref name="primer" /> Transactions of the form ''payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z'' are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications. Network nodes can validate transactions, add them to their copy of the ledger, and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 8}}
The block chain is a [[distributed database]]; in order to independently verify the chain of ownership of any and every bitcoin (amount), each network node stores its own copy of the block chain. Approximately six times per hour, a new group of accepted transactions, a block, is created, added to the block chain, and quickly published to all nodes. This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin amount has been spent, which is necessary in order to prevent [[double-spending]] in an environment without central oversight. Whereas a conventional ledger records the transfers of actual [[Banknote|bills]] or [[promissory note]]s that exist apart from it, the block chain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 5}}

===Units===
The unit of account of the bitcoin system is bitcoin. {{As of|2014}}, symbols used to represent bitcoin are BTC,<ref group="note" name="BTCcode" /> XBT,<ref group="note" name="XBTcode" /> and {{nowrap|[[File:BitcoinSign.svg|9px]]}}.<ref group="note" name="BTCsym" /><ref name=btcregs />{{rp|1}} Small multiples of bitcoin used as alternative units are millibitcoin (mBTC), microbitcoin (<U+00B5>BTC), and satoshi. Named in homage to bitcoin's creator, a ''satoshi'' is the smallest multiple of bitcoin representing 0.00000001 bitcoin, which is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.<ref name="satoshi unit" /> A ''millibitcoin'' equals to 0.001 bitcoin, which is one thousandth of bitcoin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Siluk|first1=Shirley|title=June 2 "M Day" promotes millibitcoin as unit of choice|url=http://www.coindesk.com/june-2-m-day-promotes-millibitcoin-as-unit-of-choice/|publisher=CoinDesk|accessdate=26 February 2015|date=2 June 2013}}</ref> One ''microbitcoin'' equals to 0.000001 bitcoin, which is one millionth of bitcoin. A microbitcoin is sometimes referred to as a ''bit''.

On 7 October 2014, the [[Bitcoin Foundation]] revealed a plan to apply for an [[ISO 4217]] currency code for bitcoin,<ref name = "standardize" /> and mentioned BTC and XBT as the leading candidates.<ref>{{cite web | title = Press Release October 7, 2014: Bitcoin Foundation Financial Standards Working Group Leads the Way for Mainstream Bitcoin Adoption | url = https://bitcoinfoundation.org/press-releases/press-release-october-7-2014-bitcoin-foundation-financial-standards-working-group-leads-the-way-for-mainstream-bitcoin-adoption-2/ | publisher = [[Bitcoin Foundation]] | work = Press Release | date = 7 October 2014 | accessdate = 7 November 2014}}</ref>

===Ownership===
[[File:Bitcoin Transaction Visual.svg|thumb|Simplified chain of ownership.<ref name="paper" /> In reality, a transaction can have more than one input and more than one output.]]

Ownership of bitcoins implies that a user can spend bitcoins associated with a specific address. To do so, a payer must [[digital signature|digitally sign]] the transaction using the corresponding [[private key]]. Without knowledge of the private key the transaction cannot be signed and bitcoins cannot be spent. The network verifies the signature using the [[public key]].<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 5}} If the private key is lost, the [[bitcoin network]] will not recognize any other evidence of ownership;<ref name="primer" /> the coins are then unusable, and thus effectively lost. For example, in 2013 one user said he lost 7,500 bitcoins, worth $7.5 million at the time, when he discarded a hard drive containing his private key.<ref>{{cite news|title=Man Throws Away 7,500 Bitcoins, Now Worth $7.5 Million|date=29 November 2013|url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2013/11/29/man-throws-away-7500-bitcoins-now-worth-7-5-million/|work=CBS DC|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref>

===Transactions===
{{ see also | Bitcoin network }}
A transaction must have one or more inputs. For the transaction to be valid, every input must be an unspent output of a previous transaction. Every input must be digitally signed. The use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction. A transaction can also have multiple outputs, allowing one to make multiple payments in one go. A transaction output can be specified as an arbitrary multiple of satoshi. Similarly as in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs (coins used to pay) can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such case, an additional output is used, returning the change back to the payer. Any input satoshis not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 5}}

To send money to a bitcoin address, users can click links on webpages; this is accomplished with a provisional Bitcoin [[URI scheme]] using a template registered with [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]. Bitcoin clients like [[Electrum (software)|Electrum]] and [[Armory (software)|Armory]] support Bitcoin URIs. Mobile clients recognize Bitcoin URIs in [[QR code]]s, so that the user does not have to type the bitcoin address and amount in manually. The [[QR code]] is generated from the user input based on the payment amount. The QR code is displayed on the mobile device screen and can be scanned by a second mobile device.<ref name=QRpatent>{{cite web|author1=Don W. Tyler, Jeff Isenhart, Anne Mueller, Christoph Sadil|title=Qr code-enabled p2p payment systems and methods.US 20140129428 A1|url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=20140129428.PGNR.|publisher=uspto.gov|accessdate=20 January 2015|format=Patent application|date=8 May 2014}}</ref>

===Mining===
{{see also | Cryptographic nonce | Proof of work}}
[[File:Difficulty.svg|thumb| Relative mining difficulty{{refn | group = note | Blocks in the block chain contain a number called the ''difficulty target''. The ''relative mining difficulty'' at a given time is defined as the ratio between the difficulty target at 9 January 2009 and the difficulty target at the given time. This yields relative mining difficulty at 9 January 2009 equal to 1. Higher number means higher relative difficulty. As the total network power increases, the network adjusts the mining difficulty to make mining always last about ten minutes. Therefore, the relative mining difficulty can also be interpreted as the relative power of the network.}} chart.{{refn | group = note | name = blockchain | Data acquired from [[Blockchain.info]]<ref name="Blockchain.info">{{cite web | url = https://blockchain.info/charts | title = Charts | accessdate = 2 November 2014 | publisher = [[Blockchain.info]]}}</ref>}} Vertical axis: relative mining difficulty, the scale is [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].

''Mining'' is a record-keeping service.{{refn | group = note | It is misleading to think that there is an analogy between gold mining and bitcoin mining. The fact is that gold miners are rewarded for producing gold, while bitcoin miners are not rewarded for producing bitcoins; they are rewarded for their record-keeping services.<ref name="Andolfatto2014-03" />}} Miners keep the block chain consistent, complete, and unalterable by repeatedly verifying and collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions called a ''block''. A new block contains information that "chains" it to the previous block thus giving the block chain its name. It is a [[cryptographic hash]] of the previous block, using the [[SHA-256]] hashing algorithm.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 7}}

A new block must also contain a so-called ''proof-of-work''. The proof-of-work consists of a number called a ''difficulty target'' and a number called a ''nonce'', which is [[jargon]] for "a number used only once". Miners have to find a nonce that yields a hash of the new block numerically smaller than the number provided in the difficulty target. When the new block is created and distributed to the network, every network node can easily verify the proof.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 8}} On the other hand, finding the proof requires significant work since for a secure cryptographic hash there is only one method to find the requisite nonce: miners try different integer values one at a time, e.g., 1, then 2, then 3, and so on until the requisite output is obtained. The fact that the hash of the new block is smaller than the difficulty target serves as a proof that this tedious work has been done, hence the name "proof-of-work".

By changing the difficulty target number, the average time required to find a nonce can be shortened or extended (A smaller number reduces the range of accepted nonces and increases the time required.) The bitcoin system adjusts the difficulty target number every 2016 blocks so that the average time the entire network needs to find a nonce always remains about ten minutes. In this way the bitcoin protocol ensures that it will always take about ten minutes to add a new block regardless of the size of the network or the sophistication of the mining hardware it employs.<ref name="Antonopoulos2014" />{{rp|ch. 8}} For example, on 1 March 2014 miners had to try 16.4 quintillion values on average before finding the requisite nonce, while on 1 March 2015 it was 200.5 quintillion values on average.<ref name="diffhistory">{{cite web | url=https://blockchain.info/charts/difficulty?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address= | title=Difficulty History | publisher=Blockchain.info | accessdate=26 March 2015 | Note=The ratio of all hashes over valid hashes is D x 4295032833, where D is the published "Difficulty" figure.}}</ref>

The proof-of-work system alongside the chaining of blocks makes modifications of the block chain extremely hard as an attacker must modify all subsequent blocks in order for the modifications of one block to be accepted. As new blocks are mined all the time, the difficulty of modifying a block increases as time passes and the number of subsequent blocks (also called ''confirmations'' of the given block) increases.<ref name="khanbitcoin">{{cite web | last = Ramzan | first = Zulfikar | title = Bitcoin: What is it? | url = http://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/money-and-banking/bitcoin/v/bitcoin-what-is-it | publisher = The Khan Academy | date = 2014 | accessdate = 5 April 2014}}</ref>

====Environmental costs====
The environmental cost of mining includes the generation of electricity. Even if all miners used energy efficient processes, the combined electricity consumption would be 1.46 terawatt-hours per year<U+2014>equal to the consumption of about 135,000 American homes.<ref name=ec1305>{{cite news|title=The magic of minig|url=http://www.economist.com/news/business/21638124-minting-digital-currency-has-become-big-ruthlessly-competitive-business-magic|accessdate=13 January 2015|work=The economist|date=13 January 2015}}</ref> It has been estimated that the annual environmental impact due to bitcoin mining represents approximately 0.13% of the impact caused by fiat and gold-based monetary systems.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCook|first1=Hass|title=Under the Microscope: Conclusions on the Costs of Bitcoin|url=http://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/|accessdate=15 February 2015|date= 19 July 2014 |publisher=CoinDesk}}</ref>

A ''wallet'' stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. While wallets are often described as a place to hold<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/what-is-bitcoin-explained | title = Bitcoin, Explained | publisher = Mother Jones | work = motherjones.com | date = 10 April 2013 | accessdate = 26 April 2014 | author = Adam Serwer and Dana Liebelson}}</ref> or store bitcoins,<ref name=3ceos /> due to the nature of the system, bitcoins are inseparable from the block chain transaction ledger. Perhaps a better way to describe a wallet is something that "stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings"<ref name=3ceos>{{cite web | url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnvillasenor/2014/04/26/secure-bitcoin-storage-a-qa-with-three-bitcoin-company-ceos/ | title = Secure Bitcoin Storage: A Q&A With Three Bitcoin Company CEOs | publisher = Forbes | work = forbes.com | date = 26 April 2014| accessdate = 26 April 2014 | author = Villasenor, John}}</ref> and "allows you to access (and spend) them". Bitcoin uses [[public-key cryptography]], in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated.<ref name="Economist113013Pressure">{{cite news | url = http://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21590766-virtual-currency-it-mathematically-elegant-increasingly-popular-and-highly | title = Bitcoin: Bitcoin under pressure | work = The Economist | date = 30 November 2013 | accessdate = 30 November 2013}}</ref> At its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys.

There are several types of wallet. ''Software wallets'' connect to the network and allow spending bitcoins in addition to holding the credentials that prove ownership.<ref name="Bitcoin Clients" /> Internet services called ''[[online wallet]]s'' like [[Blockchain.info]], [[Circle (company)|Circle]], Snapcard, or [[Coinbase]] offer similar functionality but may be easier to use.<ref>{{cite news | title = Be Your Own Bank: Bitcoin Wallet for Apple | url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2012/04/26/be-your-own-bank-bitcoin-wallet-for-apple/ | author = Jon Matonis | date = 26 April 2012 | accessdate = 17 November 2014 | publisher = Forbes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Bill Barhydt|title=3 reasons Wall Street can't stay away from bitcoin|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/101711220|accessdate=2 April 2015|publisher=NBCUniversal|date=4 Jun 2014}}</ref> ''Physical wallets'' also exist and are more secure, as they store the credentials necessary to spend bitcoins offline.<ref name=3ceos/> Examples combine a novelty coin with these credentials printed on metal,<ref name="theverge">{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Verge |url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/13/5207256/casascius-maker-of-shiny-physical-bitcoins-shut-down-by-treasury|title=Casascius, maker of shiny physical bitcoins, shut down by Treasury Department |publisher=The Verge |date=13 December 2013|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> wood, or plastic.

====Reference implementation====
The first wallet program, called bitcoind, was released in 2009 by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] as [[open source|open-source]] code. At the version 0.5 the client began to use new [[Qt (software)|Qt]] graphical interface (instead of [[wxWidgets]]) and the whole bundle was referred to as Bitcoin-Qt.<ref name="Bitcoin Clients">{{Cite thesis | url = http://publications.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/47166/Skudnov_Rostislav.pdf?sequence=1 | first = Rostislav | last = Skudnov | title = Bitcoin Clients | type = Bachelor's Thesis | year = 2012 | publisher = [[Turku University of Applied Sciences]] | accessdate = 16 January 2014}}</ref> It is used as a desktop wallet for payments or as a server utility for merchants and other payment services. Bitcoin-Qt, also called Satoshi client, is sometimes referred to as the [[Reference implementation|reference client]] because it serves to define the bitcoin protocol and acts as a standard for other implementations.<ref name="Bitcoin Clients"/> As of version 0.9, Bitcoin-Qt has been renamed Bitcoin Core to avoid confusion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0 released|url=https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.0|website=bitcoin.org|accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref>

===Privacy===
Privacy is achieved by not identifying owners of bitcoin addresses while making other transaction data public. Bitcoin users are not identified by name, but transactions can be linked to individuals and companies.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/518816/mapping-the-bitcoin-economy-could-reveal-users-identities/ | title=Mapping the Bitcoin Economy Could Reveal Users<U+2019> Identities | work=MIT Technology Review | date=5 September 2013 | accessdate=2 April 2014 | author=Simonite, Tom}}</ref> Additionally, bitcoin exchanges, where people buy and sell bitcoins for fiat money, may be required by law to collect personal information.<ref name="5facts">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/21/five-surprising-facts-about-bitcoin-2/ | title=Five surprising facts about Bitcoin | publisher=The Washington Post | work=washingtonpost.com | date=21 August 2013 | accessdate=2 April 2014 | author=Lee, Timothy}}</ref> To maintain financial privacy, a different bitcoin address for each transaction is recommended.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-06/06/bitcoin-retail | title=How Bitcoin lets you spy on careless companies | publisher=Conde Nast | work=wired.co.uk | date=6 June 2013 | accessdate=2 April 2014 | author=McMillan, Robert}}</ref> Transactions that spend coins from multiple inputs can reveal that the inputs may have a common owner.

===Fungibility===
Wallets and similar software technically handle bitcoins as equivalent, establishing the basic level of [[fungibility]]. Researchers have pointed out that the history of every single bitcoin is registered and publicly available in the block chain ledger, and that some users may refuse to accept bitcoins coming from controversial transactions, which would harm bitcoin's fungibility.<ref>{{cite web | first1 = Eli | last1 = Ben-Sasson | first2 = Alessandro | last2 = Chiesa | first3 = Christina | last3 = Garman | first4 = Matthew | last4 = Green | first5 = Ian | last5 = Miers | first6 = Eran | last6 = Tromer | first7 = Madars | last7 = Virza | work = 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy | title = Zerocash: Decentralized Anonymous Payments from Bitcoin | url = http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-oakland2014.pdf | date = 2014 | accessdate = 31 October 2014 | publisher = IEEE computer society}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Matonis|first1=Jon|title=Why Bitcoin Fungibility is Essential|url=http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-fungibility-essential/|publisher=CoinDesk|accessdate=26 February 2015|date=1 December 2013}}</ref> Projects such as [[Zerocoin]] and [[Cody Wilson#Dark Wallet|Dark Wallet]] aim to address these privacy and fungibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miers|first1=Ian|last2=Garman|first2=Christina|last3=Green|first3=Matthew|last4=Rubin|first4=Aviel|title=Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin|url=http://isi.jhu.edu/~mgreen/ZerocoinOakland.pdf|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=<U+2018>Dark Wallet<U+2019> Is About to Make Bitcoin Money Laundering Easier Than Ever|url=http://www.wired.com/2014/04/dark-wallet/|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of Bitcoin|l1=History of bitcoin}}
Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto,<ref group="note" name="Satoshi" /> who published his invention on 31 October 2008 in a research paper called "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash system".<ref name="paper" /> It was implemented as [[open source code]] and released in January 2009. Bitcoin is often called the first [[cryptocurrency]]<ref name="f_c" /> although prior proposals existed.<ref group="note" name="prior" /> Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralized [[digital currency]].<ref name="primer" /><ref name="Reuters101" />

One of the first supporters, adopters, contributor to bitcoin and receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was programmer [[Hal Finney (cypherpunk)|Hal Finney]]. Finney downloaded the bitcoin software the day it was released, and received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto in the world's first bitcoin transaction.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/01/03/hal-finney-received-the-first-bitcoin-transaction-heres-how-he-describes-it/|title = Hal Finney received the first Bitcoin transaction.

In March 2013, a technical glitch caused a fork in the block chain, with one half of the network adding blocks to one version of the chain and the other half adding to another. For six hours two bitcoin networks operated at the same time, each with its own version of the transaction history. The core developers called for a temporary halt to transactions, sparking a sharp sell-off. Normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software.<ref name="bug events">{{cite web | last = Lee | first = Timothy | url = http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/major-glitch-in-bitcoin-network-sparks-sell-off-price-temporarily-falls-23/ | title = Major glitch in Bitcoin network sparks sell-off; price temporarily falls 23% | publisher = http://arstechnica.com | date = 11 March 2013 | accessdate = 15 February 2015}}</ref>

===Malware===
Bitcoin-related [[malware]] includes software that steals bitcoins from users using a variety of techniques, software that uses infected computers to mine bitcoins, and different types of [[ransomware]], which disable computers or prevent files from being accessed until some payment is made. Security company [[SecureWorks|Dell SecureWorks]] said in February 2014 that it had identified almost 150 types of bitcoin malware.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/02/26/nearly-150-breeds-of-bitcoin-stealing-malware-in-the-wild-researchers-say/ | title=Nearly 150 Breeds Of Bitcoin-Stealing Malware In The Wild, Researchers Say | publisher=Forbes | work=forbes.com | date=26 April 2014 | accessdate=9 January 2015 | author=Greenburg, Andy}}</ref>

====Unauthorized mining====
In June 2011, [[Symantec]] warned about the possibility that [[botnet]]s could mine covertly for bitcoins.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Coogan |url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/bitcoin-botnet-mining |title=Bitcoin Botnet Mining|work=Symantec.com|date=17 June 2011 |accessdate = 24 January 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Malware used the [[parallel computing|parallel processing]] capabilities of [[GPU]]s built into many modern [[video card]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/16/gpu_bitcoin_brute_forcing/ | title = Malware mints virtual currency using victim's GPU | work = The Register | date = 16 August 2011 | accessdate = 31 October 2014 | author = Goodin, Dan}}</ref> Although the average PC with an integrated graphics processor is virtually useless for bitcoin mining, tens of thousands of PCs laden with mining malware could produce some results.<ref name=hajb2014/>

====Malware stealing====
Some malware can steal private keys for bitcoin wallets allowing the bitcoins themselves to be stolen. The most common type searches computers for cryptocurrency wallets to upload to a remote server where they can be cracked and their coins stolen.<ref name=haj2014>{{cite news | url=http://www.coindesk.com/nearly-150-strains-malware-bitcoins/ | title=Nearly 150 strains of malware are after your bitcoins | first=Nermin | last=Hajdarbegovic | date=27 February 2014 | work=CoinDesk | accessdate=7 March 2014 }}</ref> Many of these also [[Keylogger|log keystrokes]] to record passwords, often avoiding the need to crack the keys.<ref name=haj2014/> A different approach detects when a bitcoin address is copied to a [[Clipboard (computing)|clipboard]] and quickly replaces it with a different address, tricking people into sending bitcoins to the wrong address.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Gregg Keizer|title=Bitcoin malware count soars as cryptocurrency value climbs|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2488144/malware-vulnerabilities/bitcoin-malware-count-soars-as-cryptocurrency-value-climbs.html|website=Computerworld|accessdate=8 January 2015|date=28 February 2014}}</ref> This method is effective because bitcoin transactions are irreversible.

====Ransomware====
Another type of bitcoin-related malware is [[ransomware]]. One program called [[CryptoLocker]], typically spread through legitimate-looking email attachments, encrypts the hard drive of an infected computer, then displays a countdown timer and demands a ransom, usually two bitcoins, to decrypt it.<ref name=guardian-ransomware>{{cite news | url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/10/how-ransomware-turns-your-computer-bitcoin-miner-linkup | work=The Guardian | title=How Ransomware turns your computer into a bitcoin miner | date=10 February 2014 | accessdate=7 March 2014 }}</ref> Massachusetts police said they paid a 2 bitcoin ransom in November 2013, worth more than $1,300 at the time, to decrypt one of their hard drives.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/21/us-police-force-pay-bitcoin-ransom-in-cryptolocker-malware-scam | title=US police force pay bitcoin ransom in Cryptolocker malware scam | work=The Guardian | first=Samuel | last=Gibbs | date=21 November 2013 | accessdate=7 March 2014 }}</ref> Linkup, a combination ransomware and bitcoin mining program that surfaced in February 2014, disables internet access and demands credit card information to restore it, while secretly mining bitcoins.<ref name=guardian-ransomware/>

==Security==
Various potential attacks on the [[bitcoin network]] and its use as a payment system, real or theoretical, have been considered.  The bitcoin protocol includes several features that protect it against some of those attacks, such as unauthorized spending, double spending, forging bitcoins, and tampering with the block chain.<ref name="khanbitcoin" />  Other attacks, such as theft of private keys, require due care by users.

===Unauthorized spending===
Unauthorized spending is mitigated by bitcoin's implementation of public-private key cryptography. When Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, Bob becomes the new owner of the bitcoin. Eve observing the transaction might want to spend the bitcoin Bob just received, but she cannot sign the transaction without the knowledge of Bob's private key.<ref name="primer"/>

===Double spending===
A specific problem that an internet payment system must solve is [[double-spending]], whereby a user pays the same coin to two or more different recipients. An example of such a problem would be if Eve sent a bitcoin to Alice and later sent the same bitcoin to Bob. The bitcoin network guards against double-spending by recording all bitcoin transfers in a ledger (the block chain) that is visible to all users, and ensuring for all transferred bitcoins that they haven't been previously spent.<ref name="primer"/>{{rp|4}}

===Race attack===
If Eve offers to pay Alice a bitcoin in exchange for goods and signs a corresponding transaction, it is still possible that she also creates a different transaction at the same time sending the same bitcoin to Bob. By the rules, the network accepts only one of the transactions. This is called race attack, since there is a race which transaction will be accepted first. Alice can reduce the risk of race attack stipulating that she will not deliver the goods until Eve's payment to Alice appears in the block chain.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.cornell.edu/info4220/2013/03/29/bitcoin-and-the-double-spending-problem/ | title = Bitcoin and the Double-spending Problem | publisher = Cornell University | date = 29 March 2013 | accessdate = 22 October 2014 | author = Erik Bonadonna}}</ref>

A variant race attack (which has been called a Finney attack by reference to Hal Finney) requires the participation of a miner. Instead of sending both payment requests (to pay Bob and Alice with the same coins) to the network, Eve issues only Alice's payment request to the network, while the accomplice tries to mine a block that includes the payment to Bob instead of Alice.  There is a positive probability that the rogue miner will succeed before the network, in which case the payment to Alice will be rejected. As with the plain double-spending attack, Alice can reduce the risk of a Finney attack by waiting for the payment to be included in the block chain.<ref>{{cite paper | title = Two Bitcoins at the Price of One? Double-Spending Attacks on Fast Payments in Bitcoin | url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/248.pdf | last1 = Karame | first1 = Ghassan O. | last2 = Androulaki | first2 = Elli | last3 = Capkun | first3 = Srdjan | publisher = International Association for Cryptologic Research | year = 2012 | accessdate = 22 October 2014}}</ref>

===History modification===
The other principal way to steal bitcoins would be to modify block chain ledger entries.

For example, Eve could buy something from Alice, like a sofa, by adding a signed entry to the block chain ledger equivalent to ''Eve pays Alice 100 bitcoins''. Later, after receiving the sofa, Eve could modify that block chain ledger entry to read instead: ''Eve pays Alice 1 bitcoin'', or replace Alice's address by another of Eve's addresses. Digital signatures cannot prevent this attack: Eve can simply sign her entry again after modifying it.

To prevent modification attacks, each block of transactions that is added to the block chain includes a [[cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash code]] that is computed from the hash of the previous block as well as all the information in the block itself. When the bitcoin software notices two competing block chains, it will automatically assume that the chain with the greatest amount of work to produce it is the valid one. Therefore, in order to modify an already recorded transaction (as in the above example), the attacker would have to recalculate not just the modified block, but all the blocks after the modified one, until the modified chain contains more work than the legitimate chain that the rest of the network has been building in the meantime. Consequently, for this attack to succeed, the attacker must outperform the honest part of the network.<ref name="khanbitcoin" />

Each block that is added to the block chain, starting with the block containing a given transaction, is called a confirmation of that transaction.  Ideally, merchants and services that receive payment in bitcoin should wait for at least one confirmation to be distributed over the network, before assuming that the payment was done.  The more confirmations that the merchant waits for, the more difficult it is for an attacker to successfully reverse the transaction in a block chain<U+2014>unless the attacker controls more than half the total network power, in which case it is called a 51% attack.<ref name="51%">{{cite news | author1 = Michael J. Casey | author2 = Paul Vigna | title = Short-Term Fixes To Avert "51% Attack" | url = http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/16/bitbeat-a-51-attack-what-is-it-and-could-it-happen/ | accessdate = 30 June 2014 | work = Money Beat | publisher = Wall Street Journal | date = 16 June 2014}}</ref> For example, if the attacker possesses 10% of the calculation power of the bitcoin network and the shop requires 6 confirmations for a successful transaction, the probability of success of such an attack will be 0.02428%.<ref name="paper" />
<!--CLARIFY: ===== Vector76 attack =====
Also called an attack with confirmation, this is a combination of the 2 aforementioned attacks which gives the perpetrator the ability to spend funds twice simply with a confirmation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} -->

===Selfish mining===
This attack was first introduced by Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer at the beginning of November 2013.<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Eyal | first1 = Ittay | last2 = Gun Sirer | first2 = Emin | title = Majority is not Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable | url = http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0243 | date = 15 November 2013 | accessdate = 7 October 2014}}</ref> The attacker does not normally broadcast the blocks upon finding them. He mines his private chain and eventually (when somebody finds his own block) publishes several blocks at row. This makes the "honest" network abandon their last work and switch to the attacker's branch. As a result, honest miners lose a significant part of their revenue, while the attacker increases profits due to changes in relative hashpowers.

According to the authors it changes the incentives for rational miners and makes them want to join the attacker's pool, increasing the attacker's hashpower (which could potentially lead to a [[Cryptocurrency#Overview|51% attack]]).

However, other researchers disagree with the conclusion and point out the flaws in the article.{{vague|date=April 2015}}<ref>{{cite news | last = Hill | first = Kashmir | title = Bitcoin Is Not Broken | url = http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/11/06/bitcoin-is-not-broken/ | accessdate = 19 October 2014 | newspaper = Forbes | date = 6 November 2013}}</ref>

===Deanonymisation of clients===

Along with transaction graph analysis, which may reveal connections between bitcoin addresses (pseudonyms),<ref name=quantitative /><ref name=reid>{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=Fergal|last2=Harrigan|first2=Martin|title=An Analysis of Anonymity in the Bitcoin System|journal=Security and Privacy in Social Networks|date=2013|pages=197<U+2013>223}}</ref> there is a possible attack<ref name=dep2p>{{cite journal|last1=Biryukov|first1=Alex|last2=Khovratovich|first2=Dmitry|last3=Pustogarov|first3=Ivan|title=Deanonymisation of clients in Bitcoin P2P network|journal=ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security|date=2014|url=http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/18679}}</ref> which links a user pseudonym to its [[IP address]], even if the peer is using [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. The attack makes use of bitcoin mechanisms of relaying peer addresses and anti-[[DoS]] protection. The cost of the attack on the full bitcoin network is under <U+20AC>1500 per month.<ref name="dep2p" />
