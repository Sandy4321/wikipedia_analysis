== Plot ==
A remorseful [[Leslie Knope|Leslie]] ([[Amy Poehler]]) tells a group of Recreation Center teachers the Pawnee budget has been cut by $1,000, and five of their classes will have to be cut, but exactly which classes has not yet been determined. Later, Leslie and [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Justin Anderson|Justin Anderson]] ([[Justin Theroux]]), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in [[Indianapolis]]. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with [[Ann Perkins|Ann]] ([[Rashida Jones]]), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites [[Mark Brendanawicz|Mark]] ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]), [[Tom Haverford|Tom]] ([[Aziz Ansari]]) and [[Ron Swanson|Ron]] ([[Nick Offerman]]), specifically excludes [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Jerry|Jerry]] ([[Jim O'Heir]]), and asks [[Andy Dwyer|Andy]] ([[Chris Pratt]]) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.

Ann comes to Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find themselves unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman ([[Bonita Friedericy]]), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to [[April Ludgate|April]] ([[Aubrey Plaza]]), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife [[Characters of Parks and Recreation#Wendy Haverford|Wendy]] (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has to run to the bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.

Eventually, an accounting teacher arrives, believing demonstrations are being held to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him as to whether he enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, under penalty of [[perjury]]. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.

Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', said the episode was very funny and farcical, but grounded in reality enough to keep it from being too unbelievable or over-the-top. Sepinwall said Mark was funnier than he is in most episodes, and said there was good development in the subplots between April and Andy, as well as the blossoming love triangle between Ron, Tom and Wendy.<ref name="Sepinwall">{{Cite news |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |title=Parks and Recreation, "Leslie's House": Dinner party run amok |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |date=January 22, 2010 |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/01/parks_and_recreation_leslies_h.html |accessdate=January 22, 2010}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Sandra Gonzalez said she liked the pairing of Poehler and Theroux, but found "Leslie's House" slower than previous episodes, and felt the comedic talents of Ansari and Offerman were underused.<ref name="EW" /> Matt Fowler of ''[[IGN]]'' praised the episode for its use of a wide range of characters to provide humor, saying "Everyone got a chance to shine in this episode. They all took turns giving us a laugh and 'Leslie's House' was a tremendous example of this series firing on all cylinders."<ref name="IGN" /> Steve Kandell of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine praised the episode's satirical bent about elected officials.<ref name="NYMag" /> Steve Heisler of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' favorably compared "Leslie's House" to "[[Dinner Party (The Office)|Dinner Party]]", an episode of ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', the other comedy series created by ''Parks'' co-creator [[Greg Daniels]]. However, he said "Leslie's House" was different in that her friends were willing to attend her party and help her out, whereas in the ''Office'' episode, the characters did not want to attend the dinner party held by protagonist [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]]. Heisler said the fact that the characters liked each other so much in ''Parks and Recreation'' differentiated itself from the other series in a positive way.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Heisler |first=Steve |title=Parks and Recreation: "Leslie's House" |date=January 21, 2010 |work=[[The A.V.
