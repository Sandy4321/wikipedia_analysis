'''Baha Mousa''' was an [[Iraqi]] civilian who died whilst in [[United Kingdom|British]] custody in [[Basra]] during September 2003.  

On [[14 September]] [[2003]] Baha, a 26 year old hotel receptionist, was arrested along with six other men and taken to a British base.  Whilst in detention it is claimed that Baha and the other captives were hooded and severely assaulted by a number of British troops. Two days later Baha was found dead <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk12152004.html | title=Who Killed Baha Mousa? | author=Robert Fisk | year=December 15, 2004 | work=The Independent | accessdate=2006-09-23 }}</ref>.  A post-mortem examination found that Baha suffered multiple injuries (at least ninety-three), including fractured ribs and a broken nose, which were 'in part' the cause of his death<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5360432.stm | title=British soldier admits war crime | work=BBC News | year=19 September 2006 | accessdate=2006-09-23 }}</ref>.

Currently, seven members of the Duke of Lancaster regiment are on trial accused of several charges relating to the ill treatment of detainees, including those of war crimes under the International Criminal Court Act 2001.  On [[September 19]], 2006, [[Corporal Donald Payne]] plead guilty to a charge of inhumane treatment to persons making him the first member of the British armed forces to plead guilty to a [[war crime]] <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2365393,00.html | title=British soldier is first to admit war crime | author=Devika Bhat | coauthors=Jenny Booth | year=September 19 2006 | work=Times Online | accessdate=2006-09-23 }}</ref>.  He was subsequently jailed for one year and expelled from the army.  Six other soldiers were cleared of any wrongdoing<ref> {{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6609237.stm | title=UK soldier jailed over Iraq abuse | work=BBC News | year=30 April 2007 | accessdate=2007-04-30 }}</ref>.  The presiding judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, stated that "none of those soldiers has been charged with any offence, simply because there is no evidence against them as a result of a more or less obvious closing of ranks." <ref> {{cite web | url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/article2666413.ece | title=A bloody epitaph to Blair's war | work=Independent on Sunday | year=17 June 2007 | accessdate=2007-06-18 }}</ref>
