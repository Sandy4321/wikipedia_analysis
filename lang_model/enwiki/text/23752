'''"A Night In Sickbay"''' is the 31st episode of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the fifth episode of [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 2)|season two]]. It first aired on October 16, 2002 on the [[UPN]] network within the [[United States]]. The episode was written by [[executive producer]]s [[Brannon Braga]] and [[Rick Berman]], and directed by [[David Straiton]].

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first [[Starfleet]] starship ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'', registration NX-01. In this episode, after visiting the planet Kreetassa, Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]'s ([[Scott Bakula]]) dog Porthos falls ill with an unknown pathogen. Archer stays overnight in [[sickbay]] to look after his dog with Dr. [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Phlox]] ([[John Billingsley]]) knowing that afterwards he must take part in an elaborate apology display to the Kreetassans.

The episode featured [[Vaughn Armstrong]], who reprised his role of the Kreetassan Captain from the episode "[[Vox Sola]]". Several scenes also proved challenging for the main dog actor who portrayed Porthos, who was named Breezy. She was required to lay still for long periods, jump into Bakula's arms on command and also act on her own whilst her trainer was not on set. Berman compared the relationship between Archer and Phlox to ''[[The Odd Couple (TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'', saying that the episode was "a lot of fun".<ref name=junket/> The episode was nominated for the 2003 [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] (short form) and received the highest [[Nielsen rating]]s for any episode of ''Enterprise'' during season two at that point. However, the critical reception was mixed.

==Plot==
After a five-day away mission spent apologising on the planet Kreetassa, the away team consisting of Captain [[Jonathan Archer]] ([[Scott Bakula]]), Subcommander [[T'Pol]] ([[Jolene Blalock]]), Ensign [[Hoshi Sato]] ([[Linda Park]]), and Archer's dog, [[Jonathan Archer#Porthos|Porthos]], return to the ship to decontaminate. Porthos has acquired a pathogen on the planet surface and must be quarantined. Archer learns from Chief Engineer [[Trip Tucker|Charles "Trip" Tucker III]] ([[Connor Trinneer]]) of the ship's need for an extra plasma injector from the Kreetassans, but negotiations break down after it is discovered that Porthos had [[Territory (animal)|urinated]] on a sacred tree, once again insulting the Kreetassans. 

Archer, tired and frustrated, reacts poorly to the news and is given a list of requirements he must meet in order to apologise. He and Dr. [[Phlox (Star Trek)|Phlox]] ([[John Billingsley]]) then tend to Porthos, and Archer is consumed with worry and he ends up spending the night in [[sickbay]] to be with his dog. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer experiences the other side of life in sickbay <U+2013> the feeding of the lab animals, the doctor cutting his toenails and scraping his tongue, and catching an escaped alien bat. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension about his first officer, T'Pol. He also relates to the doctor how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice about dealing with his apparent feelings for T'Pol. 

T'Pol, working out in the gym, also keeps urging Archer to apologize to the Kreetassans for Porthos' behavior, but Archer resists doing this because he blames them for Porthos' life-threatening illness. In the end, Porthos recovers from his illness, following a pituitary transplant from an alien [[chameleon]]. Finally swallowing his pride, the captain then goes down to the Kreetassan capital city and delivers an intricate ritual apology which involves slicing a tree trunk with a [[chainsaw]], arranging the pieces of wood in a complex pattern on the ground, and chanting phrases in the Kreetassan language. Having successfully apologised to the Kreetassans, the ''Enterprise'' crew finally manage to procure not one, but three plasma injectors prior to their departure.

==Production==
Executive producers [[Rick Berman]] and [[Brannon Braga]] had worked together to write a series of episodes for ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', with "A Night in Sickbay" amongst them. Berman originally described the episode as a [[press junket]] when talking about [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 2)|season two]] at an event held by [[UPN]] for the [[Television Critics Association]]. He said it was a "very humorous episode that has our good captain going and spending some time in sickbay, because his dog gets sick. He moves into sickbay the same way a mother will move into the hospital when her child gets sick, and it ends up being an '[[The Odd Couple (TV series)|Odd Couple]]' kind of an episode between the captain and Dr. Phlox. It's a lot of fun."<ref name=junket>{{cite web|title=Hollywood Parties Draw Star Trek Celebs|url=http://www.startrek.com/news/news.asp?ID=125074|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020806135747/http://www.startrek.com/news/news.asp?ID=125074|publisher=Star Trek.com|archivedate=August 6, 2002|date=July 16, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Bakula also explained in an interview with the website TrekWeb that the episode featured Archer's dog Porthos as a background character and that it was also about Archer spending a night in sickbay with Phlox. He said that this meant that the viewer will "find out a lot of stuff about [Phlox] that we may not have wanted to know; like what he does when he's in his off hours... he has things to cut and trim!"<ref>{{cite web|last=Krutzler|first=Steve|title=Interview: Scott Bakula on why he's not "New Kirk", plus his expectations and previews for Enterprise's new season!|url=http://talk.trekweb.com/articles/2002/09/06/1031286609.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030211032743/http://talk.trekweb.com/articles/2002/09/06/1031286609.html|publisher=TrekWeb|archivedate=February 11, 2003|date=September 6, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Billingsley said later that he enjoyed working with Bakula on this episode and called "A Night in Sickbay" one of his favourites.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Billingsley|url=http://www.trektoday.com/interviews/billingsley0204.shtml|publisher=TrekNation|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> 

The episode was directed by [[David Straiton]], who had previously directed "[[Desert Crossing (Enterprise episode)|Desert Crossing]]". The shoot took six and a half days, which concluded on August 8, 2002.<ref name=prodreport /> "A Night in Sickbay" was intended to be a low-cost episode as the majority of scenes required only the use of the standing sets for the series.<ref name=dvd /> The only credited guest star in "A Night in Sickbay" was [[Vaughn Armstrong]], who played the Kreetassan Captain once again.<ref name=prodreport>{{cite web|title=It's a Dog's Life|url=http://startrek.com/production/seriesv/articles/080902.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020813002103/http://startrek.com/production/seriesv/articles/080902.asp|publisher=Star Trek.com|archivedate=August 13, 2002|date=August 9, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Armstrong is better known for his recurring role in ''Enterprise'' as Admiral [[Maxwell Forrest]], but had previously played the Kreetassan Captain in the [[Star Trek: Enterprise (season 1)|first season]] episode "[[Vox Sola]]". In order to appear as the Captain, some three and a half hours of make-up time was required, with the actor needed to arrive to have his make-up applied at 5:30am for his one day of shooting.<ref name=prodreport /> Armstrong appeared in a variety of different roles in several different ''Star Trek'' programs, dating back to the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 1)|season one]] episode "[[Heart of Glory]]".<ref name=torheart>{{cite web|last=DeCandido|first=Keith|authorlink=Keith DeCandido|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Rewatch: "Heart of Glory"|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2011/07/star-trek-the-next-generation-rewatch-qheart-of-gloryq|publisher=[[Tor Books|Tor.com]]|date=July 14, 2011|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Other make-up effects during this instalment of ''Enterprise'' included a pair of prosthetic feet for Dr. Phlox, although other effects for the character were added in post-production.<ref name=prodreport />

===Porthos===
[[image:Beagle portrait Camry.jpg|thumb|left|Porthos was played by more than one Beagle (''example of a Beagle pictured''), and was also represented by a prop dog for some scenes.]]
There were two [[Beagle]]s portraying Porthos, who were supplied by Performing Animal Troupe, an animal supply company for film and television.<ref name=prodreport/> These dogs included a female Beagle called Breezy, who was the main dog actor who played Porthos during season two.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breezy|url=http://www.performinganimaltroupe.com/dogs/breezy.html|publisher=Performing Animal Troupe|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=bowwow>{{cite web|last=Nemecek|first=Larry|title=Boldly Bow-Wowing Where No Beagle Has Bow-Wowed Before|url=http://larrynemecek.com/articles/meet-breezy-porthos-2003.pdf|publisher=LarryNemecek.com|date=March 2003|accessdate=June 27, 2013|format=PDF}}</ref> Breezy was the original double for male dog actor Prada who appeared in the first season episodes of ''Enterprise'' up until "[[Two Days and Two Nights (Enterprise episode)|Two Days and Two Nights]]", when Breezy became the main dog. She had also previously appeared as Lou in the 2001 film ''[[Cats & Dogs]]''.<ref name=bowwow/> 

More than one scene proved problematic for Breezy during the filming of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally he would have been behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera.<ref name=bowwow/> In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it into my arms, but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms."<ref name=bowwow/> In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.<ref name=bowwow/> 

A further challenge for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen.<ref name=bowwow/> At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups.<ref name=bowwow/> A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The proper was created by [[Joel Harlow]], who had also created make-up designs for the television series ''[[Carniv<U+00E0>le]]'' and the film ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Characters|url=http://www.joelharlowdesigns.com/index.php/portfolio/image-galleries/characters|publisher=Joel Harlow Designs|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref>

==Reception and home media release==
"A Night in Sickbay" was first aired in the United States on the UPN network on October 16, 2002. It received [[Nielsen ratings]] of a 3.9/6 percentage share among all adults, including 6 percent of all adults watching television at the time of the broadcast. Although overnight figures had shown a slight decrease from the previous episode, the final numbers showed that the ratings were the highest seen so far during season two and the third week of increased ratings for ''Enterprise'' in succession. This meant that 6.26 million viewers watched the episode, an increase of 860,000 viewers from the previous week's episode, making it the highest viewed episode since season one's "[[Sleeping Dogs (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Sleeping Dogs]]". Alexander Chase at ''[[USA Today]]'' said the numbers "confirm a ratings turnaround for the newest Trek series".<ref name=ratings>{{cite web|last=Krutzler|first=Steve|title=Final Ratings: "A Night In Sickbay" Provides Healthy Boost in Viewership, Demos|url=http://trekweb.com/stories.php?aid=vRKci6IVZ8qRs|publisher=TrekWeb|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> The episode placed ''Enterprise'' fourth in a list of the most highly rated science fiction/fantasy shows on television for that week, behind ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', and ''[[John Doe (TV series)|John Doe]]''.<ref name=ratings/>  

The review by "Herc" for the website [[Ain't It Cool News]], praised the story about how Porthos was named and the elements of sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol. However, he didn't think the ''Odd Couple'' type relationship between Archer and Phlox worked all the time with some misfires amongst the comedic elements. He gave the episode a rating of three out of five, describing it as "actually worth your valuable time".<ref>{{cite web|title=Enterprise 2.5 FAQ|url=http://aintitcoolnews.com/display.cgi?id=13566|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030109223520/http://aintitcoolnews.com/display.cgi?id=13566|publisher=Ain't It Cool News|archivedate=January 9, 2003|date=October 17, 2002|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for [[TrekNation]], saying that she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. However, she criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by "what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde".<ref name=greenreview>{{cite web|last=Green|first=Michelle Erica|title=A Night in Sickbay|url=http://www.trektoday.com/reviews/enterprise/a_night_in_sickbay.shtml|publisher=TrekNation|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> Jamahl Epsicokhan reviewed the episode for his website "Jammer's Reviews", giving it a score of one out of four. He called it "easily the dumbest concept for an episode of ''Star Trek'' since ''Voyager''{{'s}} holodeck was hijacked by the residents of [[Spirit Folk (Star Trek: Voyager)|Fair Haven]]".<ref name=jammer>{{cite web|last=Epsicokhan|first=Jamahl|title=Star Trek: Enterprise "A Night in Sickbay"|url=http://www.jammersreviews.com/st-ent/s2/sickbay.php|publisher=Jammer's Reviews|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}</ref> He felt that the episode made a mockery out of the characters and that some of the situations they were placed in were just ridiculous.<ref name=jammer/>

The episode was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] (short form) at the 2003 awards alongside "[[Carbon Creek (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Carbon Creek]]" and episodes of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]''.
