==Etymology and usage==
{{seealso|British Isles (terminology)}}

England is [[List of meanings of countries' names|named]] after the Angles, the largest of the [[Germanic tribes]] who settled in England in the 5th and 6th centuries, and who are believed to have originated in the peninsula of [[Angeln]], in what is now [[Denmark]] and northern [[Germany]].<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition.</ref> (The further etymology of this tribe's name remains uncertain, although a popular theory holds that it need be sought no further than the word [[angle]] itself, and refers to a fish-hook-shaped region of [[Holstein]].)<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50008463query_type=word&queryword=Angle&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=3&search_id=IEYI-46Mn2i-2137&hilite=50008463 OED (etymology) entry for Angle])</ref>

The Angles' name has had various spellings. The earliest known reference to these people is under the Latinised version '''Anglii''' used by [[Tacitus]] in chapter 40 of his [[Germania (book)|Germania]],<ref name="Fordham">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/tacitus-germanygord.html Germania] by Tacitus. Retrieved 18 November 2006.</ref> written around 98 AD. He gives no precise indication of their geographical position within [[Germania]], but states that, with six other tribes, they worshipped a goddess named [[Nerthus]], whose sanctuary was situated on "an island in the Ocean".

The early 8th century historian [[Bede]], in his [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]] (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), refers to the [[English people]] as '''Angelfolc''' (in English) or '''Angli''' (in [[Latin language|Latin]]).<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede.html Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]. Retrieved 19 November 2006.</ref>

According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the first known usage of "England" referring to the southern part of the island of Great Britain was in 897, with the modern spelling first used in 1538.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50075354?single=1&query_type=word&queryword=England&first=1&max_to_show=10 |title=OED entry for England}}</ref>

England is officially defined as "subject to any alteration of boundaries under Part IV of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the area consisting of the counties established by section 1 of that Act, Greater London and the [[Isles of Scilly]]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Interpretation+Act++&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&TYPE=QS&NavFrom=0&activeTextDocId=1838152&PageNumber=1&SortAlpha=0 |title= Schedule 1 of The Interpretation Act 1978}}</ref>

Bones and flint tools found in [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]] show that ''[[Homo erectus]]'' lived in what is now England about 700,000&nbsp;years ago.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2025530.stm Bone find may rewrite history], BBC News, 4 June 2002. Retrieved 20 November 2006</ref> At this time, [[Great Britain]] was joined to mainland Europe by a large land bridge. The current position of the English Channel was a large river flowing westwards and fed by tributaries that would later become the [[Thames]] and the [[Seine]]. This area was greatly depopulated during the period of the last major ice age, as were other regions of the British Isles. In the subsequent recolonisation, after the thawing of the ice, genetic research shows that present-day England was the last area of the British Isles to be repopulated,<ref>Stephen Oppenheimer, The Origins of the British, Constable and Robinson</ref> about 13,000&nbsp;years ago. The [[migrants]] arriving during this period contrast with the other of the inhabitants of the British Isles, coming across lands from the south east of Europe, whereas earlier arriving inhabitants came north along a coastal route from Iberia. These migrants would later adopt the [[Celts|Celtic]] culture that came to dominate much of western Europe.<ref>''Industry in England: Historical Outlines'', By Henry de Beltgens Gibbins, 9th edition, Published by C.

By AD&nbsp;43, the time of the main Roman [[invasion]], Britain had already been the target of frequent invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]]. It was first invaded by the Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]] in 55 BC, but it was conquered more fully by the [[Emperor Claudius]] in 43 AD. Like other regions on the edge of the [[Global Empire|empire]], Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans<ref>''Industry in England: Historical Outlines'', By Henry de Beltgens Gibbins, 9th edition, Published by C.

The dominant themes of the seventh to tenth centuries were the spread of [[Christianity]] and the political unification of England. Christianity is thought to have come from three directions <U+2014> from [[Rome]] to the south, and Scotland and [[Ireland]] to the north and west, respectively. From about 500&nbsp;AD, it is believed England was divided into seven [[petty kingdom]]s, known as the ''[[Heptarchy]]'': [[Northumbria]], [[Mercia]], [[East Anglia]], [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]], and [[Wessex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/england/AD410-1066|title=England AD 410<U+2013>1066 Early medieval|publisher=The British Museum|work=worldtimelines.org.uk|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref> The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms tended to coalesce by means of warfare. As early as the time of [[Ethelbert of Kent]], one king could be recognised as [[Bretwalda]] ("Lord of Britain"). Generally speaking, the title fell in the 7th century to the kings of Northumbria; in the 8th to those of [[Mercia]]; and in the 9th to [[Egbert of Wessex]], who in 825 defeated the Mercians at the [[Battle of Ellendun]].

Originally, England was a geographical term to describe the part of Britain occupied by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], rather than a name of an individual [[nation-state]]. It became politically united through the expansion of the kingdom of Wessex, whose king [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]] brought the whole of England under one ruler for the first time in 927, although unification did not become permanent until 954, when [[Edred of England|Edred]] defeated [[Eric Bloodaxe]] and became King of England.<ref>''Medieval England: rural society and economic change, 1036-1348'', ISBN 0582482186, 9780582482180 By Edward Miller, John Hatcher, Edition: 3, illustrated, reprint, Published by Longman, 1978; Original from the University of Michigan, pg. 134-147</ref>

In 1016, England was conquered by the [[Denmark|Danish]] king [[Canute the Great]] and became the centre of government for his short-lived empire. With the accession of [[Edward the Confessor]], heir of the native English dynasty, in 1042, England once again became a separate kingdom. Its ties and nature, however, were forever changed following the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066.<ref>

In the 13th century Wales (the remaining Romano-Celts) was brought under the control of English [[monarchs]] through conquest. This was formalised in the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284 and Wales was legally annexed to the [[Kingdom of England]] by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535<U+2013>1542]]. Wales shared a [[State (law)|legal identity]] with England as the joint entity originally called ''England'' and later ''[[England and Wales]]''.<ref>

An [[Pandemic|epidemic]] of catastrophic proportions, the [[Black Death]] first reached England in the summer of 1348. The Black Death is estimated to have killed between a third and two-thirds of [[Medieval demography|Europe's population]]. England alone lost as much as 70% of its population, which passed from seven million to two million in 1400.

===Early Modern period===
[[Image:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] made to commemorate the English victory over the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.]]

During the [[English Reformation]] in the [[16th century]], the external authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in England was abolished and replaced with [[Acts of Supremacy|Acts of Royal Supremacy]] and the establishment of the [[Church of England|Church of England ("Anglican Church")]] under the Supreme Governance of the English monarch. This occurred during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The English Reformation differed from its European counterparts in that its roots were more political than theological.<ref>Cf. "The Reformation must not be confused with the changes introduced into the Church of England during the 'Reformation Parliament' of 1529<U+2013>36, which were of a political rather than a religious nature, designed to unite the secular and religious sources of authority within a single sovereign power: the Anglican Church did not until later make substantial change in doctrine". Roger Scruton, ''A Dictionary Political Thought'', Macmillan: 1996, p.470.</ref>

The English Reformation paved the way for the spread of [[Anglicanism]] in the church and other institutions.

<!----------Inline cites needed----------->
The period known as the [[English Civil War|English Civil War (1642<U+2013>1651)]] saw political machinations and armed conflicts between supporters of the [[Long Parliament]] ([[Roundhead]]s) and of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] ([[Cavalier|Royalists]]) in [[First English Civil War|1642 to 1645]] and [[Second English Civil War|1648 to 1649]], followed by conflict between supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]] and of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in [[Third English Civil War|1649 to 1651]]. The War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651. It had led to the trial and execution of Charles I, the exile of his son Charles II, the replacement of the English monarchy with the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England (1649<U+2013>1653)]] and personal rule by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during [[The Protectorate|The Protectorate (1653<U+2013>1659)]].

[[Image:Charles II of England in Coronation robes.jpg|left|thumb|[[English Restoration|The Restoration]] under [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] restored peace after the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].]]
After Cromwell's death in 1659, a brief return, lead by Cromwell's weak son, to Commonwealth rule was attempted before [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Parliament invited]] Charles II to return to England in 1660 and [[Restoration (England)|restore the monarchy]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|interregnum]], the Church of England's monopoly on Christian worship in England came to an end and the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] consolidated in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established a precedent that British monarchs could not govern without parliamentary consent, although this would not be cemented until the [[Glorious Revolution]] later in the century.

Although embattled for centuries, the [[Kingdom of England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had been drawing increasingly together since the [[Protestant Reformation]] of the 16th century<ref name="Britons">{{cite book |last=Colley |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda Colley |origyear=1994 |year=2005 |title=Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707<U+2013>1837 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300059250 |page=12}}</ref> and in 1603, with the Scottish king [[James VI]] accession to the English crown, the two countries became linked by a [[personal union]], being ruled by the same [[House of Stuart|Stuart dynasty]].<ref name="Britons"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Chronology of Scottish History |publisher=Geddes & Grosset |isbn=1-85534-380-0 |last=Ross |first=David |year=2002 |quote='''1603:''' James VI becomes [[James I of England]] in the [[Union of the Crowns]], and leaves [[Edinburgh]] for [[London]]|page=56}}</ref> Following a number of attempts to unite the Kingdoms, a [[Treaty of Union]] was agreed on 22 July 1706 by representatives of the English and Scottish parliaments,<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/about/images/historical/1707union.cfm Articles of Union with Scotland 1707] www.parliament.uk </ref> and put into effect by the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] which resulted in [[political union]] between the states with the creation of the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] on 1 May 1707.<ref name="Britons"/> ([[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] joining in 1801 with all of Ireland except [[Northern Ireland]] leaving in 1922 has resulted in the current name of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]).

===Within the Union===
After the Union, England and Wales retained their separate legal identity since the continuance of the separate Scottish legal system was enshrined in the Articles of the [[Treaty of Union]]. Wales was already part of the Kingdom of England but the [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] made it explicit that laws passed for England were automatically applicable to Wales. The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 also referred to the formerly Scottish burgh of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].

<!----------Section needs more direct refs---------->
There has not been a [[Government of England]] since 1707, when the [[Acts of Union 1707]], putting into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed the previous year, joined the Kingdom of England with the Kingdom of Scotland to form the united [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].<ref>[http://www.scotshistoryonline.co.uk/union.html Treaty of Union] www.scotshistoryonline. Retrieved 6 August 2008</ref> Prior to this, England was ruled by a [[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|monarch]] and the [[Parliament of England]]. However, following the establishment of devolved government for Scotland and Wales in 1999, England was left as the only country within the United Kingdom still governed in matters by the UK government and the UK parliament in London.<ref>Groups such as [[Mebyon Kernow]] who proclaim a distinct national identity for Cornwall and campaign for a [[Cornish assembly]] would dispute this claim.</ref>

Since Westminster is the UK parliament but also legislates on matters that affect England alone, devolution of national matters to parliament/assemblies in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland has refocused attention on the anomaly called the [[West Lothian question]]. The "question" is why Scottish and Welsh MPs should continue to be able to vote on legislation relating only to England while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters.<ref>Scottish and Welsh MPs are also unable to vote on devolved issues affecting their ''own'' constituencies.</ref> This constitutional arrangement resulted in the Labour government only winning a 2004 vote to impose higher tuition fees on students in England due to the support of Scottish Labours MPs.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3434329.stm Blair wins key top-up fees vote] BBC News, 27 January 2004</ref> This "question" is also exacerbated by the large number of Scottish MPs in the government, a group sometimes disparagingly called the [[Scottish mafia]], and by having a [[Prime Minister]], Gordon Brown, who represents a Scottish constituency that is unaffected by the policy decisions he takes.

There are calls for a [[devolved English parliament]], such as by former minister [[Frank Field (politician)|Frank Field MP]],<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article4061785.ece Gordon Brown pressed on English parliament] www.timesonline.co.uk.

Today, therefore, England's affairs are managed by a combination of the [[UK government]], the [[UK parliament]], and England-specific [[quango]]s such as [[English Heritage]].

===Politics===
{{main|Politics of England}}
[[File:Palace of Westminster, London - Feb 2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Palace of Westminster]], the seat of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].]]
A total of 529 of the current 646 MPs in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] represent English constituencies, which will rise to 533 out of 650 at the [[next United Kingdom general election|next general election]].

At the 2005 General Election, the Conservative Party won more votes than any other single party, with 35.7% of the vote. However, Labour won a majority of England's MPs, having 284 MPs elected, on the basis of just 35.4% of the popular vote with the Conservative Party winning just 194 MPs. The Liberal Democrats were the third party winning 47 MPs with 22.5% of the vote, and the only other MPs elected were one for [[Respect - The Unity Coalition|Respect]] and a Kidderminster Hospital campaigner.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/vote2005/html/england.stm Results: England] bbc.co.uk.

Below the regional level, [[London]] consists of 32 [[London borough]]s and the rest of England has either [[metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|county councils]] and district councils or [[unitary authorities]]. At the lowest level, much of England is divided into [[civil parish|parishes]] though parishes are prohibited from existing in Greater London.

==Law and criminal justice==
{{main|English law}}
[[Image:Royal courts of justice.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]]]]
The [[English common law]] legal system, developed over the centuries, is also the foundation of many [[legal systems]] throughout the English-speaking countries of the world.<ref>[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0000714.html Common law - Tiscali reference]. URL retrieved 6 June 2007.</ref>
It continued to apply in [[England and Wales]] after the [[Treaty of Union]] because the terms of the Treaty specifically guaranteed the continued existence of Scotland's separate legal system, which meant that England's system has also remained separate.

The essence of English common law is that it is made by [[judge]]s sitting in [[court]]s, applying their common sense and knowledge of [[legal precedent]] (''[[stare decisis]]'') to the facts before them. The [[Courts of England and Wales|court system]] is headed by the Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales, consisting of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court of Justice]] (for civil cases) and the [[Crown Court]] (for criminal cases). The Appellate Committee of the [[House of Lords]] (usually just referred to as "The House of Lords") is presently the highest court for both criminal and civil cases in [[England and Wales]] though recent constitutional changes will see the powers of the House of Lords transfer to a new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.dca.gov.uk/consult/supremecourt/supreme.pdf Constitutional reform: A Supreme Court for the United Kingdom]|252&nbsp;KB}}, Department for Constitutional Affairs.

England comprises the central and southern two-thirds of the island of Great Britain, plus offshore islands of which the largest is the [[Isle of Wight]]. It is [[Anglo Scottish border|bordered to the north]] by Scotland and [[Wales-England border|to the west]] by Wales. It is closer to continental Europe than any other part of mainland Britain, divided from France only by a 24-[[Mile#Statute miles|statute mile]] (52&nbsp;km or 21 [[nautical mile]])<ref>[http://www.eurotunnel.com/ukcP3Main/ukcCorporate/ukcAboutUs/ukm/history.htm Eurotunnel.com]&nbsp; <U+2013> UK History</ref> sea gap.

The English/French border is halfway along the tunnel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelbritain.com/England/Kent/index.html |title=TravelBritain&nbsp; <U+2013> Kent}}</ref>

Much of England consists of rolling hills, but it is generally more mountainous in the north with a chain of low mountains, the [[Pennines]], dividing east and west. Other hilly areas in the north and Midlands are the [[Lake District]], the [[North York Moors]], and the [[Peak District]]. The approximate dividing line between terrain types is often indicated by the [[Tees-Exe line]]. To the south of that line, there are larger areas of flatter land, including [[East Anglia]] and [[the Fens]], although hilly areas include the [[Cotswolds]], the [[Chilterns]], and the [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs]].

The largest natural harbour in England is at [[Poole]], on the south-central coast. Some regard it as the second largest harbour in the world, after Sydney, Australia, although this fact is disputed (see [[harbour]]s for a list of other large natural harbours).

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of the United Kingdom}}

England has a [[temperate climate]], with plentiful rainfall all year round, although the [[season]]s are quite variable in temperature. However, temperatures rarely fall below <U+2212>5&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (23&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) or rise above 30&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (86&nbsp;<U+00B0>F). The prevailing wind is from the south-west, bringing mild and wet weather to England regularly from the Atlantic Ocean. It is driest in the [[East England|east]] and warmest in the [[South of England|south]], which is closest to the European mainland. Snowfall can occur in winter and early spring, although it is not that common away from high ground.

The highest temperature recorded in England is 38.5&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (101.3&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) on 10 August 2003 at [[Brogdale]], near [[Faversham]], in [[Kent]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3153532.stm Temperature record changes hands] BBC News, 30 September 2003.

===Major rivers===

===Major conurbations===
London is by far the largest urban area in England and one of the largest and busiest cities in the world. Other cities, mainly in central and northern England, are of substantial size and influence. The list of England's largest cities or urban areas is open to debate because, although the normal meaning of city is "a continuously built-up urban area", this can be hard to define, particularly because administrative areas in England often do not correspond with the limits of urban development, and many towns and cities have, over the centuries, grown to form complex urban agglomerations.<ref name=grd94>"Religious centres recover city status", ''The Guardian'', 8 July 1994.</ref><ref>Patrick O'Leary, "Derby's long road to city status", ''The Times'', 29 July 1977, p.14</ref> For the official definition of a UK (and therefore English) city, see ''[[City status in the United Kingdom]]''.

According to the [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] urban area populations for continuous built-up areas, these are the 15 largest conurbations (population figures from the 2001 census):

Traditional heavy and manufacturing industries have declined sharply in England in recent decades, as they have in the United Kingdom as a whole. At the same time, [[service industries]] have grown in importance. For example, [[tourism]] is the sixth largest industry in the UK, contributing 76&nbsp;billion pounds to the economy.

The generally accepted view is that the ethnic background of the [[English people|English]] populace, before 19th and 20th century [[immigration]], was a mixed European one deriving from historical waves of [[Celt]]ic, [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]], [[Norsemen|Norse]], and [[Normans|Norman]] invasions, along with the possible survival of [[Cruithne (people)|pre-Celtic]] ancestry.<ref>http://www.academon.com/lib/paper/6359.html ''Papers on "Class Struggles in 19th Century England" and similar term paper topics'', Paper #006359; 2000-2009, Academic Resources Center Inc. and Essays 411 Retrieved 2009-03-07 19:36:23</ref>

The economic prosperity of England has also made it a destination for economic migrants from Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This was particularly true during the Industrial Revolution.

Since the fall of the British Empire, many denizens of former colonies have migrated to Britain including the [[Indian sub-continent]] and the British [[Caribbean]]. A [[BBC]]-published report of the 2001 census, by the [[Institute for Public Policy Research]] stated that the vast majority of immigrants settled in London and the South East of England. The largest groups of residents born in other countries were from the Republic of Ireland, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], Germany, and the [[Caribbean]]. Although Germany was high on the list, this was mainly the result of children being born to British forces personnel stationed in that country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4218740.stm BBC&nbsp; <U+2013> "British Immigration Map Revealed"].

England has a vast and influential culture that encompasses elements both old and new. The modern culture of England is sometimes difficult to identify and separate clearly from the culture of the wider United Kingdom, so intertwined are its composite nations.

The English have played a significant role in the development of the arts and sciences. Many of the most important figures in the history of modern western scientific and philosophical thought were either born in, or at one time or other resided in, England. Major English thinkers of international significance include scientists such as Sir [[Isaac Newton]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Charles Darwin]] and New Zealand-born [[Ernest Rutherford]], philosophers such as [[John Locke]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], and economists such as [[David Ricardo]], and [[John Maynard Keynes]]. [[Karl Marx]] wrote most of his important works, including ''[[Das Kapital]]'', while in exile in Manchester, and the team that developed the first atomic bomb began their work in England, under the wartime codename Tube Alloys.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wall|first= Sir Frederick|authorlink= |title= 50 Years of Football, 1884-1934|year= 2005|publisher= Soccer Books Limited|location= |id= ISBN 1-8622-3116-8}} </ref>

English architects have contributed to many styles over the centuries, including [[Tudor architecture]], [[English Baroque]], the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style and Victorian movements such as [[Gothic Revival]]. Among the best-known contemporary English architects are [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Richard Rogers]].<ref>Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

===Cuisine===
{{main|English cuisine}}
[[File:Sunday roast - roast beef 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sunday roast]] consisting of roast beef, roast potatoes, vegetables and [[Yorkshire pudding]]]]
Although highly regarded in the Middle Ages, English cuisine later became a source of fun among Britain's French and European neighbours, being viewed until the late 20th century as crude and unsophisticated by comparison with continental tastes. However, with the influx of non-European immigrants (particularly those of south and east Asian origins) from the 1950s onwards, the English diet was transformed. Indian and Chinese cuisine in particular were absorbed into British culinary life, with restaurants and takeaways appearing in almost every town in Britain, and 'going for an Indian' becoming a regular part of British social life. A distinct hybrid food style composed of dishes of Asian origin, but adapted to British tastes, emerged and was subsequently exported to other parts of the world. Many of the well-known Indian dishes in the western world, such as [[Chicken tikka masala|Tikka Masala]] and [[Balti (food)|Balti]], are in fact dishes of this sort.<ref>http://www.anglobilia.com/culture.html; Retrieved March 7, 2009 ''Englands Culture''</ref>

[[Image:Clifton.bridge.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], [[Bristol]], designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]] and completed in 1864.]]
As birthplace of the [[Industrial Revolution]], England was home to many significant inventors during the late 18th and early 19th century. Famous English engineers include [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], best known for the creation of the [[Great Western Railway]], a series of famous [[steamship]]s, and numerous important bridges, hence revolutionising public transport and modern-day engineering.

In addition, England produced numerous scientists and inventors such as [[Richard Arkwright]], who invented the first industrial spinning machine, while [[Charles Babbage]] was the 19th century inventor of [[Analytical engine|the first computer]]; [[Alan Turing]] and [[Tommy Flowers]] invented the modern computer, and many of its associated concepts and initial technologies. [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[World Wide Web]], and much of the technologies on which it is based ([[HTTP]], [[HTML]]). [[James Blundell (physician)|James Blundell]] performed the first [[blood transfusion]]. [[Hubert Cecil Booth]] invented the [[vacuum cleaner]], and [[James Dyson]] invented the [[DC01|Dual Cyclone]] bagless vacuum cleaner. [[Edwin Beard Budding]] invented the [[lawnmower]]. [[George Cayley]] invented the [[seat belt]]. [[Christopher Cockerell]] invented the [[hovercraft]], while [[John Dalton]] was a pioneer of [[atomic theory]]. [[Michael Faraday]], best known for his revolutionary [[electric motor]], also came from England. [[Thomas Fowler]] invented the [[thermosiphon]], while [[Robert Hooke]] discovered [[Hooke's law of elasticity]]. Turn of the 20th century inventor [[E. Purnell Hooley]] invented [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]]. [[Thomas Newcomen]] and [[Thomas Savery]] were both inventors of the first [[steam engine]]s. Perhaps the most famous is [[Isaac Newton]], who promulgated [[universal gravitation]], [[Newtonian mechanics]] and [[infinitesimal calculus]]. Other inventors include [[Stephen Perry]], inventor of the [[rubber band]]; [[Percy Shaw]], inventor of the [[Cat's eye (road)|"cat's eye" road safety device]]; [[George|George Stephenson]] and son [[Robert Stephenson]], railway pioneers; [[Joseph Swan]], joint inventor and developer (with American [[Thomas Edison]]) of the [[light bulb]]; [[Richard Trevithick]], builder of the earliest steam [[locomotive]]s; [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]], inventor of the [[seed drill]]; [[Frank Whittle]], inventor of the [[jet engine]]; and [[Joseph Whitworth]], inventor of many of the modern techniques and technologies used in [[precision engineering]].

===Folklore===
{{main|English folklore}}
[[Image:Robin Hood.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Robin Hood]] Memorial, by [[Nottingham Castle]].]]

English folklore is rich and diverse. Many of the land's oldest legends share themes and sources with the [[Celt]]ic folklore of Wales, Scotland and Ireland, a typical example being the legend of [[Herne the Hunter]], which shares many similarities with the traditional Welsh legend of [[Gwyn ap Nudd]].

Successive waves of pre-Norman invaders and settlers, from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] onwards, via [[Saxons]], [[Jutes]], [[Angles]], [[Norsemen|Norse]] to the Norman Conquest have influenced the myth and legend of England. Some tales, such as that of [[The Lambton Worm]] show a distinct Norse influence, while others, particularly the events and characters associated with the [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legends]] show a distinct Romano-Gaulic slant.<ref>B. Branston ''The Lost Gods of England''.</ref>

Among the most famous English folk-tales are the legends of [[King Arthur]], although it would be wrong to regard these stories as purely English in origin as they also concern Wales and, to a lesser extent, Ireland and Scotland. They should therefore be considered as part of the folklore of the [[British Isles]] as a whole.

Post-Norman stories include the tales of [[Robin Hood]], which exists in many forms, and stories of other folk heroes such as [[Hereward the Wake]] and [[Fulk FitzWarin]] who, although being based on historical characters, have grown to become legends in their own right.

Composers from England have not achieved recognition as broad as that earned by their literary counterparts, and, particularly during the 19th century, were overshadowed in international reputation by other European composers; however, many works of earlier composers such as [[Thomas Tallis]], [[William Byrd]], and [[Henry Purcell]] are still frequently performed throughout the world today. A revival of England's musical status began during the 20th century with the prominence of composers such as [[Edward Elgar]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[William Walton]], [[Eric Coates]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Frederick Delius]] and [[Benjamin Britten]].

==Language==

[[Image:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|[[Beowulf]] is one of the oldest surviving epic poems in what is identifiable as a form of the [[English language]].]]
{{main|English language|History of the English language}}

As its name suggests, the English language, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue today (although not officially designated as such). An [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language in the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] branch of the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family, it is closely related to [[Scots language|Scots]] and the [[Frisian languages]]. As the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms merged into England, "[[Old English language|Old English]]" emerged; some of its literature and poetry has survived.

Used by aristocracy and commoners alike before the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] (1066), English was displaced in cultured contexts under the new regime by the [[Norman language|Norman French]] language of the new Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Its use was confined primarily to the lower social classes while official business was conducted in a mixture of [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]]. Over the following centuries, however, English gradually came back into fashion among classes and for official business except certain traditional ceremonies, some of which survive to this day. [[Middle English]], as it had by now become, showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the [[Renaissance]], many words were coined from Latin and [[Greek (language)|Greek]] origins; and more recent years, [[Modern English]] has extended this custom, willing to incorporate foreign-influenced words.

It is most commonly accepted that <U+2014> thanks in large part to the British Empire, and now the [[United States]] <U+2014> the English language is now the world's unofficial [[lingua franca]].<ref>[http://www.theglobalist.com/DBWeb/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=3229 English: Not America's Language? by Mauro E. Mujica - The Globalist > > Global Culture]. URL retrieved 6 June 2007.</ref>
[[English language learning and teaching]] is an important economic sector, including [[language schools]], tourism spending, and publishing houses.

===Other languages===
There is no [[UK legislation]] in respect of language use within England,<ref>[http://www.yaelf.com/history.shtml Yaelf]. Retrieved 15 November 2006.</ref> but English is the only language used in England for general official business. The only non-[[Anglic]] native spoken language in England is the [[Cornish language]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] spoken in Cornwall, which became extinct in the 19th century but has been revived and is spoken in various degrees of fluency, currently by about 2,000 people.<ref>[http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/325.html Whole Earth] magazine. Retrieved 13 November 2006.</ref> This has no official status (unlike Welsh) and is not required for official use, but is nonetheless supported by national and local government under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Cornwall County Council has produced a draft strategy to develop these plans. There is, however, no programme as yet for public bodies to actively promote the language. [[Scots language|Scots]] is spoken by some adjacent to the Anglo-Scottish Border, and there are over 100,000 [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speakers in London and areas such as Oswestry on the Welsh border<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/welsh-language |title=Welsh language: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

Most deaf people within England use [[British sign language|British sign language (BSL)]], a [[sign language]] native to Britain. The [[British Deaf Association]] estimates that 250,000 people throughout the UK use BSL as their first or preferred language,<ref>[http://www.signcommunity.org.uk/language/aboutbsl.php British Sign Language (BSL)]. Sign Community Online, 2006. Retrieved 12 September 2006.</ref> but does not give statistics specific to England. BSL is not an official language of the UK and most British government departments and hospitals have limited facilities for deaf sign language users. The Disability Discrimination Act gives sign language users the right to request 'reasonable adjustment', which is generally interpreted to mean that interpreters should be provided wherever practical. The [[BBC]] broadcasts several of its programmes with BSL interpreters.

Different languages from around the world, especially from the former British Empire and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], have been brought to England by immigrants. Many of these are widely spoken within ethnic minority communities, with [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Urdu Language|Urdu]], [[Gujarati Language|Gujarati]], [[Polish Language|Polish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] being the most common languages that people living in Britain consider their ''[[first language]]''. These are often used by official bodies to communicate with the relevant sections of the community, particularly in large cities, but this occurs on an "as needed" basis rather than as the result of specific legislative ordinances.

Other languages have also traditionally been spoken by minority populations in England, including [[Romany language|Romany]]. The use of [[Yiddish]] by the [[Jew]]ish population has dwindled, although an increasing number are able to speak [[Hebrew]].

Despite the relatively small size of the nation, there are many distinct [[Regional accents of English speakers#England|English regional accents]]. Those with particularly strong accents may not be easily understood elsewhere in the country. Use of foreign non-standard varieties of English (such as [[Caribbean English]]) is also increasingly widespread, mainly because of the effects of immigration.

===Christianity===
[[Image:Canterbury Cathedral 02.JPG|thumb|right|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] in [[Kent]], the centre of the [[Church of England]] and the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]].]]
{{seealso|Churches Together in England}}

Christianity reached England through missionaries from Scotland and from Continental Europe; the era of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St. Augustine]] (the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]) and the Celtic Christian missionaries in the north (notably [[St. Aidan]] and [[St. Cuthbert]]). The [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664 ultimately led to the English Church being fully part of Roman Catholicism. Early English Christian documents surviving from this time include the 7th century illuminated [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the historical accounts written by the Venerable Bede. England has many early cathedrals, most notably [[York Minster]] (1080), [[Durham Cathedral]] (1093) and [[Salisbury Cathedral]] (1220), In 1536, the Church was split from Rome over the issue of the divorce of [[King Henry VIII]] from Catherine of Aragon. The split led to the emergence of a separate ecclesiastical authority, and later the influence of the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], resulting in the Church of England and Anglicanism. Unlike the other three constituent countries of the UK, the Church of England is an [[established church]] (although the [[Church of Scotland]] is a 'national church' recognised in law).

<!-- [[Image:Canterbury Cathedral&nbsp; <U+2014> Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] is the [[mother church]] of the [[Church of England]], which is mother church to the [[Anglican Communion]], a significant worldwide Christian [[Christian denomination|denomination]].]] -->
The 16th century break with Rome under the reign of [[King Henry VIII]] and the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] had major consequences for the Church (as well as for politics). The Church of England remains the largest Christian church in England; it is part of the [[Anglican Communion]]. Many of the Church of England's [[List of cathedrals in the United Kingdom|cathedrals]] and parish churches are historic buildings of significant architectural importance.

Other major Christian [[Protestant]] denominations in England include the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]], the [[Baptist Church]] and the [[United Reformed Church]]. Smaller denominations, but not insignificant, include the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (the "Quakers") and the [[Salvation Army]] <U+2014> both founded in England. There are also Afro-Caribbean Churches, especially in the London area.

The [[Catholic Church in Great Britain|Roman Catholic Church]] re-established a hierarchy in England in the 19th century. Attendances were considerably boosted by immigration, especially from Ireland and more recently [[Poland]].

The Church of England remains the official established church of England.

Throughout the second half of the 20th century, immigration from many colonial countries, often from [[South Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] have resulted in a considerable growth in [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Hinduism]] in England. Cities and towns with large [[Muslim]] communities include [[Birmingham]], [[Blackburn]], [[Coventry]], [[Bolton]], [[Bradford]], [[Leicester]], London, [[Luton]], [[Manchester]], [[Oldham]] and [[Sheffield]]. Cities and towns with large [[Sikh]] communities include London, [[Slough]], [[Staines]], [[Hounslow]], [[Southall]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Ilford]], [[Barking]], [[Dagenham]], [[Leicester]], [[Leeds]], [[Birmingham]], [[Wolverhampton]] and others.

The Jewish community in England is mainly in the [[Greater London]] area, particularly the north west suburbs such as [[Golders Green]];<ref>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/England.html Jewish Virtual Library&nbsp; <U+2013> England by Shira Schonenburg].

There is a long history of the promotion of education in England in schools, colleges and universities. England is home to the oldest existing schools in the English speaking world: [[The King's School, Canterbury]] and [[The King's School, Rochester]], believed to be founded in the 6th and 7th century respectively.
At least eight existing schools in England were founded in the first millennium.
[[Sherborne School]] was granted a royal charter in 1550, but may have been the site of a school since the 8th century.<ref>http://www.nndb.com/edu/846/000111513/ 2002 Soylent Communications; Retrieved 2009, March 08</ref>
Most of these ancient institutions are now fee-paying schools; however, some [[state school]]s are also very old, most notably [[Beverley Grammar School]] founded in 700.
The oldest surviving girls' school in England is [[Red Maids' School]] founded in 1634.
The most famous schools in England are now fee-paying institutions, including [[Winchester College]] (founded 1382), [[Eton College]] (1440), [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] (1509), [[Rugby School]] (1567) and [[Harrow School]] (1572).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/familyhistory/guide/trade/apprentices.htm |title= Research, education & online exhibitions > Family history > In depth guide to family history > People at work > Apprentices |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=2008-06-16 }}</ref>

England is also home to the two oldest universities in the English speaking world: [[Oxford University]] (12th century) and [[Cambridge University]] (early 13th century). There are now more than 90 universities in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/UKHESector/FAQs/Pages/About-HE-Sector-and-Universities.aspx |title=FAQs on the higher education sector and UK universities|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref>

Primary and secondary education in England is administered by the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]]. Schools are of two main types: ''state schools'' funded through taxation and free to all, and ''private schools'' (also known as "public" or "independent" schools) funded through fees. Standards are monitored by regular inspections of state-funded schools by the [[Office for Standards in Education]], and of private schools by the [[Independent Schools Inspectorate]].

University education is the responsibility of the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]]. Students attending English Universities now have to pay tuition fees towards the cost of their education, as do English students who choose to attend a Scottish university (though Scottish students attending Scottish universities get their fees paid for them by the Scottish Government.)

==Healthcare==

{{main|Healthcare in England}}
The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service (NHS)]] is the [[Socialized medicine|publicly funded healthcare system]] in England responsible for provided the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS provides most services at no cost to the patient though there are charges associated with eye tests, dental care, prescriptions, and many aspects of personal care.

The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the [[National Health Service Act 1946]].<!--Not directly pertinent?: (The Act originally set up the NHS in [[England and Wales]] until Wales adopted its own version during the 1960s; see [[NHS Wales]].)--> Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, but it is used by less than 8% of the population, and generally as a top-up to NHS services. Recently the private sector has been increasingly used to increase NHS capacity despite a large proportion of the public opposing such involvement.<ref name="BMA 2007 survey">{{cite web |url=http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/PDFnhssystreform2007/$FILE/48751Surveynhsreform.pdf |publisher=[[British Medical Association]] |date=2007-06-01 |title=Survey of the general public's views on NHS system reform in England|format=PDF}}</ref>

{{main|Transport in England}}
The government department overseeing transport is the [[Department for Transport]].

The growth in private car ownership in the latter half of the 20th century led to major road-building programmes. Important trunk roads built include the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 Great North Road]] from London to Newcastle and Edinburgh, and the [[A580 road|A580]] "East Lancs." road between Liverpool and Manchester. The [[M6 motorway]] is the country's longest motorway running from Rugby through North West England to the Scottish border. Other major roads include the [[M1 motorway]] from London to Leeds up the east of the country, the [[M25 motorway]] which encircles London, the [[M60 motorway]] which encircles Manchester, the [[M4 motorway]] from London to South Wales, the [[M62 motorway]] from Liverpool to Manchester and Yorkshire, and the [[M5 motorway]] from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.

Most of the British National Rail network of {{convert|16116|km|mi}} lies in England. Urban rail networks are also well developed in London and other cities, including the [[Manchester Metrolink]] and the [[London Underground]]. The London Underground is the oldest and most extensive underground railway in the world, and as of 2007 consists of {{convert|407|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of line<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A48502 BBC]. Retrieved 20 November 2006.</ref> and serves 275 stations.

There are around {{convert|7100|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}} of navigable waterways in England, of which roughly half is owned by British Waterways. An estimated 165&nbsp;million journeys are made by people on Britain's waterways annually. The [[river Thames|Thames]] is the major waterway in England, with imports and exports focused at the [[Port of Tilbury]], one of the three major ports in the UK. Ports in the UK handled over 560&nbsp;million tonnes of domestic and international freight in 2005.<ref>[http://www.dft.gov.uk/162259/162469/190425/Trends_2006_FINAL_v5.pdf Department for Transport, Transport Trends 2006 (PDF)].

[[London Heathrow Airport]] is England's largest airport, the largest airport by passenger volume in Europe and one of the [[world's busiest airport]]s. [[London Gatwick Airport]] is England's second largest airport, followed by [[Manchester Airport]]. Other major airports include [[London Stansted Airport]] in [[Essex, England|Essex]], about {{convert|50|km|mi|-1}} north of London, [[Luton Airport]] and [[Birmingham, UK International Airport|Birmingham International Airport]].

==People==
{{main|English people}}
[[Image:Statue d'Alfred le Grand <U+00E0> Winchester.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of [[Alfred the Great]] in [[Winchester]]]]
The ancestry of the English, considered as an ethnic group, is mixed; it can be traced to the mostly [[Celt]]ic Romano-Britons,<ref>''[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba68/feat1.shtml Roman Britons after 410]'' by Martin Henig: ''British Archaeology''.

The 19th and 20th centuries, furthermore, brought much new [[immigration]] to England.

Ethnicity aside, the simplest view is that an English person is someone who was born or lives in England, holds British nationality and regards themselves as English, regardless of his or her racial origin. It has, however, been a notoriously complicated, emotive and controversial identity to delimit. Centuries of English dominance within the United Kingdom has created a situation where to be English is, as a [[linguistics|linguist]] would put it, an "unmarked" state. The English frequently include themselves and their neighbours in the wider term of "British" or even use English when they should use British. Over the last five years, celebrations of [[St George's Day]], England's [[national day]], have increased year on year.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4476533.stm St George's events 'not enough']. BBC News, 23 April 2005. Retrieved 12 September 2006.</ref>

Modern celebration of English identity is often found around its sports, one field in which the British [[Home Nations]] often compete individually. The English [[Football (soccer)|football]] [[English national football team|team]], [[English rugby union team|rugby union team]] and [[English cricket team|cricket team]] often cause increases in the popularity of celebrating Englishness.

==Nomenclature==
The country is named after the Angles, one of several [[Germanic tribe]]s who settled the country in the fifth and sixth centuries.
There are two distinct linguistic patterns for the name of the country.

{{col-begin}}
{{col-1-of-2}}

Alternative names include:
* The slang "Blighty", from the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] ''bila yati'' meaning "foreign".
* The ancient name "[[Albion]]", supposedly referring to the white ({{lang-la|alba}}) cliffs of [[Dover, England|Dover]]. Although it refers to the whole island of Great Britain, it is occasionally, and incorrectly, used for England. Following the Roman conquest of Britain, the term contracted to mean only the area north of Roman control and is today a relative of [[Alba]], the [[Celtic languages]] name for Scotland.
* More poetically, England has been called "this sceptred isle... this other Eden" and "this green and pleasant land", quotations from the poetry of [[William Shakespeare]] (in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'') and [[William Blake]] (''[[And did those feet in ancient time]]'') respectively.

Slang terms sometimes used for the people of England include "Sassenachs" or "Sasanachs" (from the [[Scots Gaelic]] and [[Irish Gaelic]] respectively, both originally meaning "Saxon", and originally a Scottish [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] term for [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland]] Scots), "Limeys" (in reference to the [[citrus fruit]]s carried aboard English sailing vessels to prevent [[scurvy]]) and "Pom/Pommy" (used in [[Australian English#Vocabulary|Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]]), but these may be perceived as offensive. Also see [[alternative words for British]].

The two main symbols of England are the [[St George's Cross]] (the [[English flag]]), and the ''Three Lions'' [[coat of arms of England]].

Other [[national emblem|national symbols]] exist, but have varying degrees of official usage, such as the [[Oak|oak tree]] and the [[rose]].

England's [[National Day]] is [[St George's Day]] ([[Saint George]] being the [[patron saint]]), which is on 23 April.<ref name="St. George">{{cite news |title=The Great Saint George Revival |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/82166.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=23 April 1998 |accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref>

===St. George's Cross===
{{main|St. George's Cross}}
<!----------This section has no references; please add them---------->
[[Image:St George's Flag.jpg|thumb|right|The [[flag of England]] is the [[St George's Cross]]. The red cross appeared as an emblem of England during the Middle Ages and the [[Crusades]] and is one of the earliest known emblems representing England.]]

The St. George's Cross is a red cross on a white background and is the [[flag of England]].

It is believed to have been adopted for the uniform of English soldiers during the [[Crusades]] of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/stgeorge.html |title=St. George <U+2013> England's Patron Saint |publisher=Britannia.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref> From about 1277 it became the national [[flag of England]].

St. George's Cross was originally the flag of [[Genoa]] and was adopted by England and the City of London in 1190 for their ships entering the Mediterranean to benefit from the protection of the powerful Genoese fleet. The maritime [[Republic of Genoa]] was rising and going to become, with its rival [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], one of the most important powers in the world. The English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the [[Doge of Genoa]] for this privilege. The cross of St George would become the official [[Flag of England]].

A red cross acted as a symbol for many [[Crusade]]rs in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became associated with [[St. George]] and England, along with other countries and cities (such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Milan]] and the [[Republic of Genoa]]), which claimed him as their [[patron saint]] and used his cross as a banner. It remained in national use until 1707, when the [[Union Flag]] (also known as the Union Jack, especially at sea) which English and Scottish ships had used at sea since 1606, was adopted for purposes to unite the whole of Great Britain under a common flag. The flag of England no longer has much of an official role, but it is widely flown by Church of England properties and at sporting events.

Until recently, the flag was not commonly flown in England with the British [[Union Flag]] being used instead. This was certainly evident at the 1966&nbsp;football World Cup when English fans predominantly flew the latter. However, since devolution in the United Kingdom, the St George Cross has experienced a growth in popularity and is now the predominant flag used in English sporting events.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clarke |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6141770.stm |title=England &#124;Football <U+2013> shaping a new England? |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref>

===Three Lions===
[[Image:England COA.svg|100px|right|Coat of arms of England]]
[[Image:Royal Standard of England.svg|100px|right|Royal Standard of England]]

The [[coat of arms]] of England are described as ''gules, three lions passant guardant or armed and langued Azure''.<ref>[[Brooke-Little]], J.P., FSA (1978) [1950]. Boutell's Heraldry (Revised Edition ed.). London: Frederick Warne LTD. pp. 205<U+2013>222. ISBN 0-7232-2096-4</ref> The earliest surviving record of their use was by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] ("Richard the Lionheart") in the late 12th century.

Since union with Scotland and Northern Ireland, the arms of England are no longer used on their own; instead they form a part of the conjoined [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. However, both [[the Football Association]] and the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] use logos based on the three lions. In recent years, it has been common to see banners of the arms flown at English football matches, in the same way the [[Lion Rampant]] is flown in Scotland.

In 1996, ''[[Three Lions (Song)|Three Lions]]'' was the official song of the England football team for the [[1996 European Football Championship]], which were held in England.

===Rose===
[[Image:Tudor rose.svg|125px|right|Tudor rose]]
The [[Tudor rose]] is the [[national flower|national floral emblem]] of England, and was adopted as a national emblem of England around the time of the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref>[http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page828.asp National Flowers of the UK], 10 Downing Street. Retrieved 14 September 2006.</ref>

The rose is used in a variety of contexts in its use for England's representation. The ''Rose of England'' is a [[Heraldic badge|Royal Badge]], and is a Tudor, or half-red-half-white rose,<ref>[http://www.sportnetwork.net/main/s245/st74325.htm England's Rose]&nbsp; <U+2013> The Official History, Sport Network. Museum of Rugby, 3 June 2005. Retrieved 18 September 2006.</ref> symbolising the end of the Wars of the Roses and the subsequent marriage between the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]]. This symbolism is reflected in the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] and the crest of the [[The Football Association|FA]]. However, the rose of England is often displayed as a red rose (which also symbolises [[Lancashire]]), such as the badge of the England national rugby union team. A white rose (which also symbolises [[Yorkshire]]) is also used on different occasions.

===Anthem===
England does not have an official designated national anthem, as the United Kingdom as a whole has "[[God Save the Queen]]". However, the following are often considered unofficial English national anthems:
* "[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]"
* "[[Land of Hope and Glory]]"
* "[[Enigma Variations|Nimrod]]"
* "[[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]]"
* "[[Heart of Oak]]"

"[[God Save the Queen]]" is usually played for English sporting events, such as football matches, against teams from outside the UK,<ref name="gystlm">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Devolution/Story/0,,190958,00.html |title=Guardian&nbsp; <U+2014> National Anthem faces red card}}</ref> although "Land of Hope and Glory" was used as the English anthem for the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200208050035 |title=New Statesman&nbsp; <U+2013> Sport&nbsp; <U+2013> Jason Cowley loves the Commonwealth Games |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> Since 2004, "Jerusalem" has been sung before England cricket matches,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anthem4england.co.uk/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4 |title=Anthem 4 England&nbsp; <U+2014> Jerusalem&nbsp; <U+2014> English Anthems&nbsp; <U+2014> News |accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref> and "[[Rule Britannia]]" ("Britannia" being the Roman name for Great Britain, a personification of the United Kingdom) was often used in the past for the [[English national football team]] when they played against another of the [[home nations]].
