'''Keadby''' is a small [[village]] lying just off the [[A18 road (England)|A18]], west of [[Scunthorpe]], in [[North Lincolnshire]], England.  It lies on the West bank of the [[River Trent]]. It is pronounced "Kidby". Keadby was traditionally in the county of Lincolnshire.

Keadby's economic significance historically lies in that it was chosen as the destination for the [[Stainforth and Keadby Canal]], opened in 1802. The canal is now mostly a leisure waterway for pleasure boaters, with Keadby being at the "end of the line", although there is still a lock onto the tidal Trent.

==Amenities==
Keadby used to have Three Public houses.  The Barge (previously The Friendly Fox, earlier The Friendship) is currently closed.  The Auld South Yorkshire suffered fire damage in 2011, although there are plans to rebuild. The Mariners Arms closed in 1991, and until recently was used as a private school. There is also a [[chip shop]], a [[working men's club]], a small [[Post Office]] and a local shop.

==Flooding==
On occasion the village is prone to flooding. In May 2006, due to heavy rainfall, ground floors of several houses were flooded in the Queens Crescent and Day Close areas.

==King George V Bridge==
{{Main|Keadby Bridge}}

The nearest settlement is Keadby (although the railway station by the bridge is called Althorpe, a village farther away), where the King George V Bridge (also known as Keadby Lifting Bridge) provides a crossing for twin rail lines, a road and a pedestrian walkway over the Trent, connecting the [[Isle of Axholme]] to [[Scunthorpe]] and the rest of [[North Lincolnshire]]. The bridge opened on 21 May 1916, at which time the 3,000-ton lifting span was Europe's heaviest [[bascule bridge]].<ref name =LiftingBridge>{{cite journal|year=1953|month=July|title=Keadby Lifting Bridge|journal= The Railway Magazine|page=434}}</ref> The lifting span was fixed in position in 1955 and no longer opens.

==Moveable bridges==
[[File:Vazon Sliding Bridge.jpg|right|thumb|220px|View towards Keadby with the Vazon Sliding Railway Bridge in the foreground]]The King George V Bridge is not the only [[moveable bridge]] in the vicinity of Keadby. There are canal locks at the point where the Stainforth and Keadby Canal connects with the River Trent in Keadby. On the canal, just before these locks, the B1392 road crosses the canal over the Keadby Swing Bridge. Approximately {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1}}  farther along the canal, a railway line crosses the canal over the Keadby Sliding Bridge, also known as Vazon Sliding Railway Bridge. This is an unusual [[retractable bridge]] that can be rolled out of the line of the canal to allow boats through. Just beyond the Sliding Bridge is a small manually operated [[swing bridge]].<ref name=Vazon>{{cite web|url=http://www.penninewaterways.co.uk/sheffield/sy9.htm|title=Vazon Sliding Railway Bridge|work=Pennine Waterways}}</ref>

==Local industry==
At Keadby is [[Keadby Power Station]], and 'Port Services', a small port for inward bound timber and scrap metal.
