'''Westcott railway station''' was a small station built to serve the village of [[Westcott, Buckinghamshire]], and nearby buildings attached to [[Ferdinand James von Rothschild|Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild]]'s estate at [[Waddesdon Manor]]. It was built by the [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1871 as part of a short [[Horsecar|horse-drawn]] [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]] to allow for the transport of goods from and around his extensive estates in [[Buckinghamshire]] and to connect the Duke's estates to the [[Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway]] at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]]. A lobbying campaign by residents of the town of [[Brill]] led to the tramway being converted for passenger use and extended to [[Brill railway station]] in 1872, becoming known as the [[Brill Tramway]].

Cheaply built and [[Land grading|ungraded]], and using poor quality [[locomotive]]s, services on the line were very slow, initially limited to {{convert|5|mph|sigfig=1}}. In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to [[Oxford]], but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the [[Metropolitan Railway]] in 1899.

Following the 1933 transfer of the Metropolitan Railway to public ownership to become the [[Metropolitan Line]] of [[London Passenger Transport Board|London Transport]], Westcott station became a part of the [[London Underground]], despite being over {{convert|40|mi|sigfig=1}} from central London. The management of London Transport believed it very unlikely that the line could ever be made viable, and Westcott station was closed, along with the rest of the line, from 30 November 1935. The station building and its associated house are the only significant buildings from the Brill Tramway to survive other than the former [[junction station]] at Quainton Road.

==Brill Tramway==
On 23 September 1868 the small [[Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway]] (A&BR) opened, linking the [[Great Western Railway]]'s station at [[Aylesbury railway station|Aylesbury]] to the [[London and North Western Railway]]'s [[Varsity Line|Oxford to Bletchley line]] at [[Verney Junction railway station|Verney Junction]].<ref name="Connor00-47">Connor (2000), p.47</ref> On 1 September 1894 London's [[Metropolitan Railway]] (MR) reached Aylesbury,<ref name="Connor00-47" /> and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894.<ref name="Connor00-47" /> Through trains from the MR's London terminus at [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] commenced on 1 January 1897.<ref name="Connor00-47" />

[[Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]], had long had an interest in railways, and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 to 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a [[light railway]] to carry freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR's line at [[Quainton Road railway station|Quainton Road]].<ref name="Oppitz73">Oppitz (2000), p.73</ref>{{#tag:ref|Because the proposed line ran on land owned by the Duke of Buckingham and by the Winwood Charity Trust, who consented to its construction,<ref name="Simpson69">Simpson (2005), p.69</ref> the line did not need Parliamentary approval and construction could begin immediately.<ref name="Oppitz73" /><ref name="Mitchelliii">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>iii</ref>|group=note}}
The first stage of the line, known as the [[Brill Tramway|Wotton Tramway]], was a {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} line from Quainton Road via [[Wotton railway station|Wotton]] to a coal siding at [[Kingswood, Buckinghamshire|Kingswood]],<ref name="Horne18">Horne (2003), p.18</ref> and opened on 1 April 1871.<ref name="Oppitz73" /><ref name="Demuth6">Demuth (2003), p.6</ref> Intended for use by [[Horsecar|horse trams]], the line was built with [[Baulk road|longitudinal sleepers]] to avoid horses tripping on the sleepers.<ref name="Horne18" /><ref name="Oppitz74">Oppitz (2000), p.74</ref>

Lobbying from the nearby town of [[Brill]] for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to [[Brill railway station]], at the foot of [[Brill Hill]] {{frac|3|4}} of a mile (1.2&nbsp;km) from the hilltop town of Brill itself,<ref name="Horne18" /> in the summer of 1872 and the introduction of two [[mixed train]]s each day in each direction,<ref name="Demuth6" /><ref name="Oppitz75">Oppitz (2000), p.75</ref> at which time the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two [[Aveling and Porter]] [[traction engine]]s modified to work as locomotives for the line, each with a top speed of {{convert|8|mph|sigfig=2}},<ref name="Oppitz75" /><ref name="Simpson70">Simpson (2005), p.70</ref> although a speed limit of {{convert|5|mph|sigfig=1}} was enforced.<ref name="Simpson69" />

The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the [[trustee]]s of his [[estate (law)|estate]] set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to [[Oxford]].{{#tag:ref|Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built it would have been the shortest route between Oxford and the City of London.<ref name="Horne18" />|group=note}} The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899,<ref name="Connor00-47" /> although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC.<ref name="Demuth18">Demuth (2003), p.18</ref>{{#tag:ref|Although from 1899 services were operated by the Metropolitan Railway (the Metropolitan Line of the London Underground from July 1933), the track and stations remained owned by the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company and controlled by the Trustees of the late Earl Temple's Estate.<ref name="Demuth18" /> The MR had an option to purchase the line outright, but it was never taken up.<ref name="Oppitz77">Oppitz (2000), p.77</ref>|group=note}}

==Services and facilities==
Westcott station was the second station from Quainton Road, about {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} east of Quainton Road.<ref name="Mitchellii">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>ii</ref> The station consisted of a single platform with a small wooden station building,<ref name="Simpson90">Simpson (2005), p.90</ref> and was immediately south of the village of [[Westcott, Buckinghamshire|Westcott]],<ref name="MitchellIX">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>IX</ref> which at the time of the railway's opening had a population of about 150.<ref name="Mitchell36">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>36</ref> Initially named "Westcott Siding", the station was renamed "Westcott" shortly after opening.<ref name="Mitchell36" /> The station was initially built with a single low wooden platform, primarily intended for loading and unloading freight.<ref name="Simpson72">Simpson (2005), p.72</ref> After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single [[Brown, Marshalls and Co. Ltd.|Brown Marshall]] passenger carriage on the line;<ref name="Simpson72" /> at this time, a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.<ref name="Simpson72" />

Limited by poor quality locomotives and the bumpy, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, trains ran very slowly in the area; in 1882 trains took 20 minutes to travel the short distance from Quainton Road to Westcott, and 50 minutes from Westcott to Brill.<ref name="Mitchellv">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>v</ref>

From 1872 to 1894 Westcott station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day.<ref name="Mitchelliv">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>iv</ref> Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day in each direction until closure in 1935.<ref name="Mitchelliv" /> Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad reduced journey times from Westcott to Quainton Road and Brill to 13 minutes and 28 minutes respectively.<ref name="Mitchellv" />

Passenger trains generally served the station only on weekdays, although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays.<ref name="Mitchelliv" /> While the village of Westcott was small, the proximity of [[Ferdinand James von Rothschild|Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild]]'s estate at [[Waddesdon Manor]] made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger and goods traffic.<ref name="Simpson90" />

Despite the low frequency of service and relatively low numbers of people using the station, Westcott station was staffed; the single employee's responsibilities included maintaining the [[oil lamp]]s on the platform and working a nearby [[level crossing]] gate.<ref name="Mitchell35">Mitchell & Smith (2006), <U+00A7>35</ref> As with all employees on the line, staff at the station were contractually obliged to "devote themselves exclusively to the service, attend regularly during the appointed hours and to refrain from using improper language, cursing or swearing".<ref name="Oppitz75" /> The single member of staff was provided with a house immediately adjacent to the station; built by the Duke of Buckingham, the house bears the inscription "B&C" ([[Viscount Cobham#Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos (1822)|Buckingham & Chandos]]).<ref name="Simpson90" />

A small [[gasworks]] a short distance to the south of Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate.<ref name="Simpson90" /><ref name="MitchellIX" /> A short [[spur line]] was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village.<ref name="Simpson90" /> In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.<ref name="MitchellIX" />

==Closure==
{{Quote box|width=25em|salign=right|quote=On Saturday night, for the last time, an antiquated little tank engine drew an equally antiquated passenger coach along the seven-mile railway line between the Bucks villages of Quainton Road and Brill. The train contained officials of the Metropolitan Railway Company, including an assistant superintendent. It stopped at each of the five stations on the line. Documents, records, and all valuables from each station were placed in the guard's van and then the station lights were put out and the train steamed along to its destination at Quainton Road. Soon the engine and coach will be on their way to Neasden and the scrap heap.<ref name="Times closure" />

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways aside from the small [[Waterloo & City Railway]], was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (LPTB).<ref name="Demuth18" /> As a consequence, despite it being {{convert|43|mi|km}} from the [[City of London]], Westcott station became part of the [[London Underground]] network.<ref name="Foxell66">Foxell (2010), p.66</ref>{{#tag:ref|Despite being a part of the London Underground network, Westcott<U+2014>in common with all Metropolitan Line stations north of Aylesbury<U+2014>was never shown on the [[tube map]].<ref name="Horne53">Horne (2003), p.53</ref>|group=note}} The Brill Tramway was by this time losing significant sums of money.
