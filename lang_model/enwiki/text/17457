'''Jade Linsey Johnson''' (born 7 June 1980, [[London]]) is an [[England|English]] athlete, specialising in [[long jump]].

She is [[allergy|allergic]] to sand.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/4292557.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jumping ahead of the competition | date=2005-03-03 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref>

Johnson came second in the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]]. Later she won the silver medal at the [[2002 European Championships in Athletics|2002 European Championships]] and finished fourth at the [[2003 World Championships in Athletics|2003 World Championships]]. Her personal best is 6.81&nbsp;metres, an Olympic qualifying distance, achieved in 2008 during the [[European Cup in Athletics 2008|European Cup]], where she placed second.

In 2006 she had a public spat with fellow British athlete [[Kelly Sotherton]] with the media claiming they openly threw insults at each other. Kelly Sotherton had been British number one at the long jump and heptathlon at the time, with Jade just having returned from a serious injury. In November 2007 she had her lottery funding removed making it harder for her to return to top rank competition. However, since then, she has set personal bests in the [[100 metres]] and [[200 metres]] sprints and in the long jump. She has also stated that she is now enjoying the sport more.

She came seventh in the final of the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics - Women's long jump|long jump in the 2008 Beijing Olympics]], jumping 6.64&nbsp;metres. She was very frustrated with her own performance and expressed a dissatisfaction that the winner the Brazilian [[Maurren Higa Maggi]] had previously tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.<ref>{{cite news| last = Phillips| first = Michael| title = Olympics: Johnson angry after Brazilian with drugs past wins long-jump gold| work = The Guardian| publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited| date = 2008-08-23| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/23/olympics2008.olympicsathletics1 | accessdate =2008-11-10 | location=London}}</ref>

Johnson was selected to represent Great Britain at the [[2009 European Indoor Championships]] but had to withdraw due to an injury.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/7919574.stm British trio will miss Europeans]. [[BBC Sport]] (2009-03-02). Retrieved on 2009-03-02.</ref>

On 25 August 2009, it was announced that she would compete in the 2009 series of [[Strictly Come Dancing]] on BBC1 with professional dancer [[Ian Waite]]. During final dress rehearsal for the 14th November edition of the show, Jade suffered a serious injury to her right knee, and therefore was forced to withdraw on the 21st November. She stated that she was "devastated" to withdraw but had to be "realistic" and praised her dance partner [[Ian Waite]] for his support. <ref>BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8372235.stm</ref> <ref>BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/8360903.stm</ref> Johnson returned with the other celebrities to perform at the final, and was given an extended time slot so she could perform the [[tango (ballroom)|Tango]] that she had been due to perform before having to pull out.
