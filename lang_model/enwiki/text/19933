{{nihongo|'''Organization XIII'''|XIII<U+6A5F><U+95A2>|J<U+016B>san Kikan}} is a fictional group of characters featured in [[Square Enix]] and [[Buena Vista Games]]' ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' video game series. ''Kingdom Hearts'' is a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] of various [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] settings based in a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|universe]] made specifically for the series. The group is comprised of thirteen [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Heartless and Nobody|Nobodies]], beings without hearts. The name is derived from the fact that there are thirteen members in the group.

The Organization was originally introduced in [[Kingdom Hearts#Final Mix|''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'']]'s unlockable trailer, "Another Side, Another Story [deep dive]", where the Japanese was translated as "the Thirteenth Order", then as the "Organization" in the game ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' where they serve as the main antagonists. The Organization returns as the main antagonists in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' where they seek to use the power of Kingdom Hearts to become complete beings.<ref name="HeartlessKH">'''Sa<U+00EF>x:''' Pitiful Heartless, mindlessly collecting hearts. And yet they know not the true power of what they hold. The rage of the Keyblade releases those hearts. They gather in darkness, masterless and free<U+2026>until they weave together to make Kingdom Hearts. And when that time comes, we can truly, finally exist. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> The characters from Organization XIII will be featured in one of the new games in the series, ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'', as playable characters, along with a fourteenth member.<ref name="NI-Fam3582d"/>

==Creation and influence==
[[Image:Sa<U+00EF>x-ConceptArt.jpg|thumb|right|340px|This concept art of Sa<U+00EF>x also depicts his "berserker" transformation and his claymore.]]
The Organization XIII characters were created by [[Tetsuya Nomura]] and other members of his development staff, starting with Xemnas, the first member, and Roxas, the last. Each member's name is an anagram of their name prior to becoming a Nobody, along with an "[[x]]".<ref name="KH-NI-KHIIU">{{cite web| title = Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania - Tetsuya Nomura Interview| url = http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI/KH2U| publisher = Kingdom Hearts Ultimania| accessdate = 2007-08-10}}</ref> Each known member receives a title indicating both their role in Organization XIII and their personality, as well as their own breed of lesser Nobodies.

He stated that with speculation, players can still be happy with a game even after it becomes old.<ref name="KH-NI-KHIIU"/>

==Members==
The Organization was first formed when the six former disciples of [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#DiZ|Ansem the Wise]] became Heartless. Their Nobodies then created the Organization. Members are numbered in the order in which they joined, with Xemnas, the Nobody of Xehanort, numbered one as their leader.<ref name="KH-NI-KHIIU"/> As Nobodies, they lack emotion and morality, and are unable to feel guilt and remorse for their actions.<ref name=emotion>'''Yen Sid:''' Nobodies may seem to have feelings, but this is a ruse---they only pretend to have hearts.

{{nihongo|'''Xemnas'''|<U+30BC><U+30E0><U+30CA><U+30B9>|Zemunasu}} is the Nobody of '''[[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Xehanort|Xehanort]]'''. He is the leader of the Organization, and the main antagonist of ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Xemnas is voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]] in the Japanese version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'', and by [[Paul St. Peter]] in the English version. His original self was named Ansem, as he took his master's name before becoming a Nobody. He controls Sorcerer Nobodies, and in battle he uses Aerial Blades and manipulates [[nothing]]ness to phase through solid matter and manifest energy-based shields and projectiles.<ref name=ultimania /> In [[Kingdom Hearts#Final Mix|''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'']], Xemnas appears as an optional [[boss (video game)|boss]] in Hollow Bastion, called {{nihongo|"Unknown"|<U+8B0E><U+306E><U+7537>|Nazo no Otoko|lit. "Unknown Man"}}. In ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', he is infrequently spoken of by the members of the Organization, who refer to him only as the "Superior".

In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Xemnas initially appears in Roxas's dreams, as he struggles to remember what he is.<ref name="KH-NI-KHIIU"/> Xemnas also makes two appearances at Hollow Bastion; in the second, his identity is clarified and his face revealed. His plan is explained as increasing the power of Kingdom Hearts by having Sora destroy Heartless, releasing the hearts inside them. Xemnas appears again, in the World That Never Was, when [[DiZ]] attempts to contain Kingdom Hearts's power with a device of his creation. However, DiZ's machine overloads and explodes, killing its creator, leaving a huge hole in Kingdom Hearts, and causing many of the hearts to rain down and become Heartless. Xemnas uses what is left of Kingdom Hearts's power to summon the emotions of rage and hatred and take on a new form to fight Sora's party. Though Xemnas is thought to be defeated, he manages to separate Sora and Riku from the others, and attacks them. However, the two defeat him, and he then fades into darkness.

===Xigbar===
{{nihongo|'''Xigbar'''|<U+30B7><U+30B0><U+30D0><U+30FC><U+30EB>|Shigub<U+0101>ru}}, is a senior member, number II, of the Organization who appears in ''Kingdom Hearts II''.

Xigbar's original self was named {{nihongo|Braig|<U+30D6><U+30E9><U+30A4><U+30B0>|Buraigu|extra=mistransliterated as Bleig in the North American version}}. Xigbar is voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]] in the English version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and [[H<U+014D>ch<U+016B> <U+014C>tsuka]] in the Japanese version. He controls Sniper Nobodies, and in battle he uses [[raygun|Gun Arrow]]s and manipulates [[space]] to teleport himself, warp his bullets, and levitate upside down.<ref name="ultimania"/> Xigbar is will appear in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] and will be featured as a playable character in the game's multiplayer mode.<ref name="KHI-New">{{cite web| url = http://www.khinsider.com/news/informatin-on-the-new-kh-games.html| title = Trailer + Artwork on the New KH games!| date = [[2007-09-20]]| publisher = Kingdom Hearts Insider| accessdate = 2007-09-21}}</ref>

Xigbar initially appears before Sora at Hollow Bastion near the beginning of the third game, though he never takes off his hood, and compares him to Roxas. During the player's second visit to the Land of Dragons, he transforms a dragon into a Heartless, and leaves after Sora confronts him in the Emperor's Palace, summoning his Nobodies to cover his escape. In the World That Never Was, Xigbar confronts Sora again, confusing him by calling him Roxas. Xigbar fights Sora's party, and after they defeat him, he fades into the darkness, refusing to clarify to Sora the mystery of "Roxas".

Xaldin's original self was named {{nihongo|Dilan|<U+30C7><U+30A3><U+30E9><U+30F3>|Diran|extra=mistransliterated as Dilin in the North American version}}. Xaldin is voiced by [[David Dayan Fisher]] in the English version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and [[Y<U+014D>suke Akimoto]] in the Japanese version. With his powers, he uses [[wind]] to manipulate his six [[lance]]s and shield himself. Xaldin's lances can transform into a dragon-shaped contraption to attack opponents with whirlwinds. He controls lance-wielding Dragoon Nobodies.<ref name="ultimania"/>

Xaldin first appeared in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' at Hollow Bastion with other members. He later confronts Sora in [[Beast (Disney)|Beast's]] Castle when he manipulates the Beast's rage by various means so that a powerful Nobody and Heartless could be created from the Beast.<ref>'''Goofy:''' That's right. And they were gonna make you into a Heartless. That way, they could get that Nobody of yours and have control over it. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> But Sora's interference with his plan forces Xaldin to steal the Beast's mystical rose to temper the Beast's rage. Sora and the Beast find him, and he reveals that the Organization needs Kingdom Hearts to become complete beings.<ref>'''Xaldin:''' When Kingdom Hearts is ours, we can exist fully and completely. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> He then kidnaps [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]], forcing the Beast to choose whether Belle or the rose is more important to him. The plan fails when Belle gets away with the rose and Xaldin falls against Sora and the Beast. 

===Vexen===
{{nihongo|'''Vexen'''|<U+30F4><U+30A3><U+30AF><U+30BB><U+30F3>|Vikusen}}, is a scientist who appears in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''. He is also known as the {{nihongo|"Chilly Academic"|<U+3044><U+3066><U+3064><U+304F><U+5B66><U+7A76>|Itetsuku Gakky<U+016B>}}. Vexen's original self was {{nihongo|Even|<U+30A8><U+30F4><U+30A7><U+30F3>}}, and he was interested in studying Xehanort's memories. Vexen can control [[ice]] and carries a large [[shield]] in battle that blocks any frontal attacks made against him.<ref name="ultimania"/> Vexen is voiced by Tatsuya Kando in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''<ref name="CoM-GSTechInfo">{{cite web| title = Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Tech Info| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/kingdomheartschainofmemories/tech_info.html| accessdate = 2007-09-24}}</ref> and [[Nachi Nozawa]] in ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories''.

In ''Chain of Memories'', Vexen sides with Zexion and Lexaeus, other members occupying the castle's basements, to prevent Marluxia's plan to overthrow the Organization.<ref name = RikuVsSora>'''Vexen:''' Yes, he and his companions arrived earlier. By now that dog Marluxia is already using Namin<U+00E9> to meddle with Sora's heart. / '''Zexion:''' Interesting. I had no idea. / '''Vexen:''' I don't think Marluxia plans to hand Sora over, but...he can play his little game. If he gets Sora, then we need only acquire Riku. If he truly is like the Superior, then we will be untouchable! {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|developer=Square Enix|publisher=Square Enix|date=2004-12-07 |platform=Game Boy Advance |language=English}}</ref> He first battles [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] in order to gather data to create a replica of him.<ref name= BattleData>'''Vexen:''' Ha ha ha... This battle has made it clear. The darkness coursing through you is a tremendous power. All you needed was the right provocation. / '''Riku:''' Great. So this was a trick? / '''Vexen:''' Precisely. Your fiery reaction provided just the data I needed.

What do you mean, remake my heart?! The real Riku's a wimp who can't deal with the darkness inside him. What do I want with the heart of a loser? / '''Larxene:''' Any objections, Vexen?

Encountering [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], Vexen says that he came to collect his "debt" and provokes Sora's anger by making him believe that he controlled Riku rather than created a replica.<ref>'''Vexen:''' That's no way to greet a stranger, Sora. I am Vexen. I've come to collect your debt. / '''Goofy:''' Do you owe him something? / '''Sora:''' Of course not! / '''Vexen:''' Oh, but you do. You owe me for reuniting you with your former friend. / '''Sora:''' You don't mean <U+2014> / '''Vexen:''' Yes. I am the one who brought Riku to you. / '''Sora:''' So...you're the one...

What have you done with him? {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|developer=Square Enix|publisher=Square Enix|date=2004-12-07 |platform=Game Boy Advance |language=English}}</ref> 

After their battle, Vexen gives Sora the card to Twilight Town with the intention of revealing Roxas's existence.<ref>'''Vexen:''' As we fought, I delved deep into your memory...and look what I found. This is a card crafted from memories locked in the other side of your heart.

===Lexaeus===
{{nihongo|'''Lexaeus'''|<U+30EC><U+30AF><U+30BB><U+30A6><U+30B9>|Rekuseusu}}, is a well-built fighter in Organization XIII's ranks, one of the two members of the Organization in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' that only appear in [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]]'s story. He is also known as the {{nihongo|"Silent Hero"|<U+9759><U+304B><U+306A><U+308B><U+8C6A><U+5091>|Shizuka naru G<U+014D>ketsu}}. His original self was {{nihongo|Aeleus|<U+30A8><U+30EC><U+30A6><U+30B9>|Ereusu|extra=mistransliterated as Eleus in the North American version}}. Lexaeus is voiced by Tatsuya Kando in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''<ref name="CoM-GSTechInfo"/> and [[Fumihiko Tachiki]] in ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories''.

Lexaeus, along with Vexen and Zexion, are older members of the Organization who occupy the basement levels of Castle Oblivion in the second game. When they find Marluxia plans to overthrow the Organization by capturing and manipulating Sora, Lexaeus and Zexion decide to capture Riku and use him in the same fashion to counter Marluxia. When it becomes dangerously apparent that Sora might fall into Marluxia's grasp, Lexaeus confronts Riku directly, trying to convince him to open himself up to the power of the darkness in his heart. Riku refuses to give in and Lexaeus attacks him. He employs a large [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] and [[soil|earth]], throwing his tomahawk, breaking rocks and shaking the arena itself.<ref name="ultimania"/> Riku manages to defeat the warrior, but with his last bits of strength, Lexaeus releases all of the darkness within him in hopes of overwhelming and consuming Riku. However, [[List of characters in the Kingdom Hearts series#King Mickey|King Mickey]] protects Riku from the part of Xehanort's Heartless in his heart. ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories'' alters Lexaeus's death; Xehanort's Heartless possesses Riku's body and kills Lexaeus.

===Zexion===
{{nihongo|'''Zexion'''|<U+30BC><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30AA><U+30F3>|Zekushion}}, is a manipulator appearing in ''Chain of Memories''. He is also known as the {{nihongo|"Cloaked Schemer"|<U+5F71><U+6B69><U+3080><U+7B56><U+58EB>|Kage Ayumu Sakushi|lit. "Shadow-walking Schemer"}}. Zexion's original self was [[DiZ|Ansem the Wise]]'s youngest lab assistant, and named {{nihongo|Ienzo|<U+30A4><U+30A8><U+30F3><U+30C4><U+30A9>|Ientso}}. He convinced Ansem the Wise that they should build an underground lab for research. He is voiced by [[Akira Ishida]] in ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories''. Zexion uses his power of [[illusion]], used to mimic others' weapons, disguise himself as others, and create duplicates of himself.<ref name="NI-Famitsu3"/> His unique weapon is a [[Encyclopedic dictionary|lexicon]]. Before ''[[Kingdom Hearts II#Final Mix+|Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix]]'', Zexion's weapon and powers were unknown because he had died without fighting. Because Nomura was unsure if it would be revealed later, he kept information about it secret. The development team also destroyed his gravestone in the World That Never Was that would have shown his weapon.<ref name="KH-NI-KHIIU"/> 

Zexion is one of two Organization members who appear only in Riku's story in ''Chain of Memories''. Zexion tracks Riku's actions until Vexen's death; Zexion and Lexaeus then decide to use Riku to counter Marluxia's plan to use Sora. After Marluxia is killed, Zexion sees Riku as unnecessary and attempts to destroy Riku himself. He leads Riku into a manifestation of Destiny Islands, Riku's home. There, Zexion tells Riku about how he threw away his friends and his home and opened the door to darkness, thus destroying the islands. Following Riku's battle with a large [[Heartless]], Zexion disguises himself as Sora and attacks Riku, telling him that he's become a pawn of the darkness. He engulfs Riku in light, but a vision of Kairi convinces Riku to accept darkness and light. With newfound confidence, Riku follows Zexion's scent through the light and causes Zexion to flee. Axel brings the Riku Replica to Zexion and convinces the replica that he can become "real" by gaining power that the real Riku does not have. The replica agrees, and as per Axel's suggestion, kills Zexion.

===Sa<U+00EF>x===
{{nihongo|'''Sa<U+00EF>x'''|<U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30AF><U+30B9>|Saikusu}} appears in ''Kingdom Hearts II''.

He has an X-shaped scar on his face and wields a [[claymore]].

Sa<U+00EF>x will appear in ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] and will be featured as a playable character in the game's multiplayer mode.<ref name="KHI-New"/>

Sa<U+00EF>x first appeared in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' in Hollow Bastion. He appears again in Twilight Town after Sora defeats his Berserker Nobodies and warns Sora of Axel's intention to turn him into a Heartless. After Sora defeats the Heartless army at Hollow Bastion, Sa<U+00EF>x appears and explains Sora's purpose in the Organization's plans and refuses Sora's request to meet Kairi, whom Sa<U+00EF>x kidnapped. After Sa<U+00EF>x summons a horde of Heartless, [[Maleficent]] attempts to use her own Heartless to battle Sa<U+00EF>x, but his Nobodies quickly dispatch them and overwhelm Maleficent. Later, at the World That Never Was, when Namin<U+00E9> helps Kairi escape, Sa<U+00EF>x appears to deal with the two, but is stopped by Riku in the guise of Xehanort's Heartless; Sa<U+00EF>x fled. Once Kingdom Hearts neared completion, Xemnas gives him permission to destroy Sora and his friends. Despite appearing calm, Sa<U+00EF>x shows his true nature when he fights Sora in the World That Never Was by absorbing the light from the Kingdom Hearts [[moon]], which puts him in a [[lunatic|berserk]] state where he wildly attacks with his [[claymore]].<ref name="ultimania" /> After Sora defeats him, he dies while pining for Kingdom Hearts to give him his heart.

===Axel===
{{nihongo|'''Axel'''|<U+30A2><U+30AF><U+30BB><U+30EB>|Akuseru}}, who utilizes a pair of [[chakram]], as well as [[fire]] with the Assassin Nobodies under his control,<ref name="ultimania"/> appears in both ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' and ''Kingdom Hearts II''.

Nomura designed Axel on a similar concept as [[Turks (Final Fantasy VII)#Reno|Reno]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. Nomura wanted to see what it would be like to have a similar character in a different world and role.<ref name="NI-Famitsu2"/> Axel is voiced by [[Keiji Fujiwara]] in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', and the Japanese version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'', while he is voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]] in the English version of ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref name="CoM-GSTechInfo"/><ref name="KHII-GSTechInfo">{{cite web| title = Kingdom Hearts II Tech Info| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/tech_info.html| accessdate = 2007-09-04}}</ref> Axel will appear in ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] and will be featured as a playable character in the game's multiplayer mode.<ref name="KHI-New"/> 

In ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'', Axel pretends to join with Larxene and Marluxia in their plan to seize control of the Organization. To gain their trust, he assassinates Vexen when ordered by Marluxia.<ref name = Traitor/><ref name= VexenDies/> He later attempts to derail the plans by setting [[Namin<U+00E9>]] free so that she can reveal to Sora the truth about how she manipulated his memory. Eventually, Axel confronts Marluxia, prepared to destroy him. Marluxia uses Namin<U+00E9> as a shield to keep Axel at bay, though Axel resolves to go through her. When Sora makes a sudden appearance, Marluxia vanishes with Namin<U+00E9>, leaving Sora to fight Axel. Sora defeats Axel, after which he states the existence of their relation before vanishing. After Marluxia is defeated by Sora, Axel enlists the aid of the [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Riku Replica|Riku Replica]] to get rid of Zexion in Castle Oblivion's basement levels.

In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', Axel attempts to rescue Roxas from DiZ's virtual Twilight Town. In ''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix'' it was shown that he received orders to bring back or kill Roxas. Despite Axel's efforts, Roxas merges with Sora. Later, acting separately from the Organization, Axel kidnaps Kairi to bait Sora to him. However, Sa<U+00EF>x takes her away so the Organization can use her to fuel Sora's anger. During a visit to Twilight Town, Sa<U+00EF>x warns Sora that Axel desires to turn him into a Heartless. Axel appears after the Heartless invasion of Hollow Bastion to Sora, and informs him that Organization XIII has been using him to get hearts. He then apologizes for getting Kairi involved. Axel later finds Sora in a pathway to the World That Never Was and chooses to fight Nobodies with him. The numbers get overwhelming and Axel performs a [[suicide attack]] to save Sora. Fading away, Axel apologizes for kidnapping Kairi and asks Sora to rescue her.<ref>'''Axel:''' Well, that's what happens when you put your whole being into an attack. You know what I mean? Not that Nobodies actually HAVE beings...right? Anyway, I digress. Go, find Kairi. Oh, almost forgot... Sorry for what I did to her. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II |developer=[[Square Enix]] |publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> When asked what he was trying to do, Axel admits he wanted to see Roxas, who made him feel like he had a heart, and Sora made him feel the same way.<ref>'''Axel:''' I wanted to see Roxas. He...was the only one I liked... He made me feel...like I had a heart. It's kind of...funny... You make me feel...the same... Kairi's in the castle dungeon. Now go. {{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix U.S.A., Buena Vista Games |date=2006-03-28 |platform=PlayStation 2 |language=English}}</ref> With the last of his strength, Axel opens an entrance to the World That Never Was.

===Demyx===
{{nihongo|'''Demyx'''|<U+30C7><U+30DF><U+30C3><U+30AF><U+30B9>|Demikkusu}} was first introduced in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. He is also referred to as the {{nihongo|"Melodious Nocturne"|<U+591C><U+60F3><U+306E><U+3057><U+3089><U+3079>|Yas<U+014D> no Shirabe}}. Demyx is voiced by [[Ryan O'Donohue]] in the English version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and [[Kenichi Suzumura]] in the Japanese version. Demyx first appeared in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' at Hollow Bastion with the other Organization XIII members. He later appeared in the [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Olympus Coliseum|Underworld]], the world in which he first removes his hood. He is confronted for stealing the Olympus Stone, an object that protects the bearer from the effects of the Underworld. He refers to Sora as Roxas, having been given orders to "use aggression to liberate [Sora's] true disposition" but nevertheless still proclaiming "they sent the wrong guy for this". He fights Sora with the use of his [[water]] abilities and [[sitar]]<ref name="ultimania"/> to create duplicates, giving the player a time limit to defeat them all and leaving after losing. The two cross paths again at Hollow Bastion during the Heartless attack, which involves Demyx's Dancer Nobodies. Upon being reminded that he is a Nobody, and has no heart, Demyx commands the "traitor" to be silent, and uses his duplicates and water attacks;<ref name=ultimania /> Demyx fades into darkness at the conclusion of the battle.

===Luxord===
{{nihongo|'''Luxord'''|<U+30EB><U+30AF><U+30BD><U+30FC><U+30C9>|Rukus<U+014D>do}}, described by Jiminy Cricket as "a master of rhetoric". He was first introduced in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and is also known as the {{nihongo|"Gambler of Fate"|<U+904B><U+547D><U+3092><U+8CED><U+3059><U+8005>|Unmei o Tosu Mono}}. Luxord is voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]] with an English accent in the English version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and by [[Jouji Nakata]] in the Japanese version. His lesser Nobodies are Gambler Nobodies. With games of luck, Luxord is able to transform Sora into a card or a die; and uses his cards as weapons, defense or hiding places. Luxord also has power over time.<ref name="ultimania"/> 

Luxord appears in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' at [[Port Royal]] from ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', where he revives the curse of the Aztec gold, and the cursed pirates along with it. Luxord makes use of the opportunity to scout the powerful Grim Reaper Heartless and the gold's curse to ascertain as to whether or not they would be useful to the Organization in terms of Sora's part in their plan and making Port Royal's people assist in it as Heartless. For amusement, he has his Nobodies steal four of the Aztec medallions while having Grim Reaper curse [[Jack Sparrow]]. Sora defeats Grim Reaper in order to free Jack from his curse and Luxord collects the forthcoming heart before escaping without fighting Sora and his party himself. At the World That Never Was, Luxord traps Sora's companions in his [[playing card|card]]s, leaving Sora to fight alone in a battle. Luxord fades back into darkness, unable to comprehend how "Roxas" could kill him.

===Marluxia===
A relatively new recruit to the Organization, courtesy of Xigbar, {{nihongo|'''Marluxia'''|<U+30DE><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30E3>|M<U+0101>r<U+016B>sha}} is lord of Castle Oblivion and Sora's main antagonist in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''. He is also referred to as the {{nihongo|"Graceful Assassin"|<U+512A><U+96C5><U+306A><U+308B><U+51F6><U+5203>|Y<U+016B>ga naru Ky<U+014D>jin|lit. "Graceful Assassin's Blade"}}. Marluxia is voiced by Tatsuya Kando in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''<ref name="CoM-GSTechInfo"/> and [[Sh<U+016B>ichi Ikeda]] in ''Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories''. He uses a [[scythe]] and his control over [[flower]]s to attack.<ref name="ultimania"/>

In ''Chain of Memories'', Marluxia and Larxene conspires to overthrow the Organization by using [[Namin<U+00E9>]] to manipulate Sora's memories. He gives Sora his first set of world cards to proceed through the castle. He assigns Axel to eliminate Vexen when his plan to use the Riku Replica fail. Larxene fails to kill Sora and is eliminated as well. Marluxia is later confronted by Axel, who accuses Marluxia and Larxene of being traitors for conspiring against the Organization. Axel attempts to kill Marluxia, however, Marluxia returns to the thirteenth floor with Namin<U+00E9>, tricking Sora into fighting Axel for him. Seeing Axel defeated, Marluxia anticipates Sora's arrival on the thirteenth floor. He orders Namin<U+00E9> to erase Sora's memories, but she refuses. When Marluxia implies that he will kill her for disobeying him, Sora demands that Namin<U+00E9> erase his memories for her safety, as his promise will remain and he can protect her. Marluxia says that Sora would become just like the Riku Replica, but the Riku Replica surprises Marluxia, who then engages Sora. The two fight, but Sora realizes he has been fighting a replica of Marluxia. He later finds the real Marluxia, in a new form, and kills him.

===Larxene===
{{nihongo|'''Larxene'''|<U+30E9><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30FC><U+30CC>|Rakush<U+012B>nu}} is the only female member and was first introduced in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' where she conspired with Marluxia to overthrow Organization XIII by using Sora. She is also known as the {{nihongo|"Savage Nymph"|<U+975E><U+60C5><U+306E><U+5996><U+59EB>|Hij<U+014D> no Y<U+014D>ki}}. Larxene uses [[electricity|thunder]] to fight and wields [[knives]] held between her fingers and thrown as her weapons.<ref name="ultimania"/> Larxene is agile and can call forth bolts of lightning in battle. Larxene is voiced by Rieko Katayama in ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories''<ref name="CoM-GSTechInfo"/> and [[Yuko Miyamura]] in ''Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories''. In ''Chain of Memories'', she entices Sora to believe the false memories Namin<U+00E9> implanted in his mind. Larxene later appears to Sora, after he fought the Riku Replica for the fourth time, planning to destroy them all. Again, Larxene mocks Sora for "chaining" himself to false memories of Namin<U+00E9> and the "promise" he made to her. She is later killed by Sora, Donald, and Goofy.

===Roxas===
[[Image:Roxas ultimania.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Roxas is the "Key of Destiny", and number XIII in Organization XIII.]]<!--

Misterious is spelled according to how it was written in actual English in published materials prior to the release of Kingdom Hearts II.
It is an intentional misspelling on our part to accurately convey the information of the character's real-world background.

-->
The youngest and newest member of the Organization, {{nihongo|'''Roxas'''|<U+30ED><U+30AF><U+30B5><U+30B9>|Rokusasu}}, was found in Twilight Town by Xemnas. He is also referred to as the {{nihongo|"Key of Destiny"|<U+3081><U+3050><U+308A><U+3042><U+3046><U+9375>|Meguriau Kagi}}. Roxas's original self is Sora. He is voiced by [[Jesse McCartney]] in the English version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' and [[Koki Uchiyama]] in the Japanese version. When pre-release ''Kingdom Hearts II'' screenshots and video showed this character without an Organization coat, he was featured prominently, emphasizing his importance to the future game's plot. He is referred to as {{nihongo|"Misterious Boy" [''[[sic]]'']|<U+8B0E><U+306E><U+5C11><U+5E74>|Nazo no Sh<U+014D>nen}} in the ''Kingdom Hearts Series <U+03B1> Ultimania ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~''.<ref name="KHS-UltimaniaAlpha>{{cite book| year = 2005| title = Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania <U+03B1> ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| language = Japanese| isbn= 4-7575-1597-9}}</ref> In battle, he uses the "Oathkeeper" and "Oblivion" Keyblades, which represent Sora's memories of Kairi and Riku, as well as the power of [[light]]. As a stronger Nobody, Roxas controls Samurai Nobodies.<ref name="ultimania"/> Roxas's backstory and his joining of Organization XIII itself will be explored in the upcoming ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', for the [[Nintendo DS]]. Roxas will be a playable character in the game.<ref name="KHI-New"/>

Unlike the other Organization members, Roxas lacks memories of his previous life, due to the short time Sora had spent as a Heartless. During Roxas's time in the Organization, he and Axel became friends, but Roxas leaves to find answers as to why he possesses the Keyblade. He is confronted by Riku, who defeats Roxas and takes him to DiZ. In ''Kingdom Hearts II'', DiZ places Roxas in a [[Virtual reality|virtual]] Twilight Town, leaving him without any memory of the Organization and with a fabricated identity to throw them off. While here Roxas begins seeing his other self's memories in dreams. Roxas lives an otherwise normal life in "Twilight Town" until Axel infiltrates it to save him. Despite Axel's attempts to stop him and Roxas gaining back his memories of the Organization, Roxas merges with Sora early in the game, which also causes some of Roxas's memories to influence Sora. 

Roxas appears twice more later in the game. The first is a battle with Sora, which shown only as a cut scene, is never fully explained. In ''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix'', Sora's battle with Roxas is made playable, and a cut scene is added that shows Xemnas explaining that Axel's death triggered the reappearance of Roxas. Roxas appears once again with Namin<U+00E9> before Kairi enters the corridor of darkness back to Destiny Islands. He and Namin<U+00E9> imply that they will live on within Sora and Kairi as both a part of them and as individuals, as seen in the ending cinematic when they smile at each other through Sora and Kairi.
