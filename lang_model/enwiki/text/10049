The '''1969 USS ''Enterprise'' fire''' is a major fire and series of explosions that broke out aboard [[USS Enterprise (CVN-65)|USS ''Enterprise'' (CVAN-65)]] on January 15, 1969, off the coast of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The fire broke out after a Zuni rocket attached to an aircraft detonated, and spread after further rocket and bomb explosions blew holes into the flight deck, allowing burning jet fuel to enter the ship's interior. 28 sailors were killed, 314 injured, 15 aircraft were destroyed, and the total cost of aircraft replacement and shipboard repair was over $126 million dollars.<ref name="Enterprise III"/>

== Background ==

''Enterprise'' departed Alameda for her fourth deployment to Vietnam, and eighth deployment overall, on January 6, 1969.<ref name="Enterprise I">{{cite web|title=Deployments of USS Enterprise|url=http://www.navysite.de/cvn/cvn65deploy.htm|website=navysite.de|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref> At the time of the fire, the ship was off the coast of Hawaii, conducting a final battle drill before steaming for Vietnam.<ref name="Enterprise II">{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=David|title=Tragedy remembered as USS Enterprise is retired|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tragedy-remembered-as-uss-enterprise-is-retired/|accessdate=12 August 2014|agency=CBS News}}</ref>
== Fire ==

At approximately 8:19am, ''Enterprise'' was turning to port to conduct flight operations when a Zuni rocket, equipped with a 15 pound warhead of Composition B explosive and mounted to an [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4J Phantom]] parked on the stern, exploded after being heated by the exhaust from an MD-3A "Huffer", a tractor-mounted [[Ground support equipment#Air Start Unit (ASU)|air starting unit]] used to aid in starting aircraft.<ref name="Enterprise III">{{cite web|title=The USS ENTERPRISE (CVAN-65) fire and munition explosions|url=http://www.insensitivemunitions.org/history/the-uss-enterprise-cvan-65-fire-and-munition-explosions/|website=insensitivemunitions.org|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Enterprise V">{{cite web|title=Explosios Rocks USS Enterprise|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/explosion-rocks-uss-enterprise|website=This Day in History|publisher=History Channel|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref> The explosion perforated the aircraft's fuel cells, and ignited the leaking JP-5 jet fuel. About a minute later, three additional Zuni rockets exploded; these blasts blew holes into the flight deck, allowing the burning JP-5 to pour into the 03 ("oh-three") level directly under the flight deck.<ref name="Enterprise III"/> Captain [[Kent Lee]], commanding officer of the ''Enterprise'', directed the port turn to continue after the first explosion, steering the ship into the wind to blow smoke away from the ship.<ref name="Enterprise IV">{{cite news|last1=Galito|first1=Jacob|title=Enterprise Remembers 1969 Fire|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=64783|accessdate=12 August 2014|agency=USS Enterprise Public Affairs|publisher=United States Navy}}</ref>
Approximately three minutes after the initial explosion, a bomb mounted to the Phantom exploded, having been engulfed in flames from the earlier explosions and burning fuel. This explosion blew a larger hole, approximately 8 feet by 7 feet, into the flight deck. The heat from the blast ignited additional fires on the 03 level, and debris from the explosion caused holes in the deck; this allowed burning fuel to spread further, entering the 02 ("oh-two") and 01 ("oh-one") levels and eventually the first deck. This explosion also damaged the twin agent units that provided firefighting foam to the area, rendering them inoperable, and severed fire hoses in the area. In short order, a second [[Mark 82]] bomb detonated, followed by a larger 500-pound bomb. Several minutes after the larger bomb detonated, a bomb rack holding three MK-82 bombs exploded. This blast tore a large hole, approximately 18 feet by 22 feet, into the flight deck, and ruptured a 6,000 gallon fuel tank mounted to a tanker aircraft; a massive fireball resulted from the fuel igniting, spreading the fire further. All told, eighteen explosions occurred, blowing eight holes into the flight deck and beyond.<ref name="Enterprise III"/> 

Despite the damage and the loss of the twin agent unit, the crew was able to extinguish the fires within four hours.<ref name="Enterprise IV"/>

The nuclear-powered frigate [[USS Bainbridge (CGN-25)|USS ''Bainbridge'']] came to the stricken carrier's aid during the fire.<ref name="Enterprise VI">{{cite web|title=Fire On The Flightdeck|url=http://www.ewind.com/~sayc/cvan65-fire.html|website=ewind.com|accessdate=12 August 2014}}</ref>
== Aftermath ==

The following day, ''Bainbridge'' escorted ''Enterprise'' to Pearl Harbor, where the ship underwent repairs.<ref name="Enterprise VI"/> Despite the damage, the ship was repaired in 51 days, after which ''Enterprise'' continued on her regularly scheduled deployment.<ref name="Enterprise V"/><ref name="Enterprise IV"/> ''Enterprise'' returned to Alameda on July 2, 1969.<ref name="Enterprise I"/> 

This was the last of three major fires to befall U.S. aircraft carriers in the 1960's. [[USS Oriskany fire|A fire aboard USS ''Oriskany'']] on October 26, 1966, killed 44 sailors and injured 156 more, and [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|a fire aboard USS ''Forrestal'']] on July 29, 1967 killed 134 sailors and injured 161.
