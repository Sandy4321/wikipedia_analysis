'''John Ronald Skirth''' (11 December 1897<U+2013>1977) served in the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] during the [[First World War]].  His experiences during the [[Battle of Messines]] and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] led him to resolve not to take human life, and for the rest of his army service he made deliberate errors in targeting calculations to try to ensure the guns of his battery missed their aiming point on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate. Many years later, after retiring from a career as a teacher, he wrote a memoir of his years in the army, describing his disillusionment with the conduct of the war and his conversion to [[conscientious objector|conscientious objection]].  In 2010 the memoir was published as ''The Reluctant Tommy''.<ref name=rel>{{cite book|last=Skirth|first=Ronald|title=The Reluctant Tommy: An Extraordinary Memoir of the First World War|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0230746732|editor=Barrett, Duncan}}</ref>

==Early life and war service==
Skirth was born in the [[Chelmsford]] [[registration district]]<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=YhhgGrK2Ik3HevTTQZSkzQ&scan=1|title=Index entry<U+2014>Births March 1898<U+2014>Skirth John Ronald, Chelmsford 4a 571|accessdate=22 September2010|work=FreeBMD|publisher=[[Office of National Statistics]]}}</ref> and grew up in [[Bexhill-on-Sea]]. In October 1916, during the [[First World War]], he was called up to the [[British Army]] two months before his 19th birthday, having requested that the process be expedited. He became a Battery Commander's Assistant in the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], responsible for making the calculations necessary to target the large guns of a field battery.  When he argued with a superior officer over whether to use a French church for target practice he was demoted in rank from [[Corporal]] to [[Bombardier (rank)|Bombardier]].<ref>Barrett, Michele. ''Casualty Figures: How Five Men Survived the First World War''. Verso, 2007, p. 67.</ref> 

Skirth saw action in the [[Battle of Messines]], in which two of his closest friends, Bill and Geordie, were killed. On the same day he had an epiphany when he stumbled across the body of a dead German of about his own age, and realised that one of the shells he had targeted may well have killed him.<ref>Barrett 2007, pp. 70<U+2013>72.</ref> This was to mark a turning point in his thinking about the war as he determined that he was morally responsible for his actions and for their consequences, despite the chain of command.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p. 77.</ref>

[[Image:Ronald Skirth standing (1917).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Skirth in 1917]]
During the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], Skirth and another friend, Jock Shiels, left their post when they discovered that their commanding officer had ignored an order to withdraw from the front line.  Skirth was knocked out by a shell which killed Shiels, and subsequently suffered from [[shell-shock]] and [[amnesia]]. Following a period of convalescence in hospital in France, he was sent to the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]] in December 1917, where his battery was being reorganised. There, following a relapse of shell-shock, he was treated in hospital in [[Schio]] and at the mud spa at [[Montegrotto]].<ref>Barrett 2007, pp. 79<U+2013>80.</ref> 

In Italy, Skirth made a resolution that he would do everything within his power to avoid further loss of human life.<ref>Barrett 2007, p.78.</ref>  He felt that the "just war" he had signed up for was anything but,<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.160.</ref> and was disillusioned with the army and the conduct of the war.  In a church in the Italian village of [[Campo San Martino|San Martino]], near [[Vicenza]], he made a private pact with God that he would never again help to take a human life.<ref>Barrett 2007, pp. 76<U+2013>78.</ref>  He wrote to his future wife, Ella Christian, explaining that he had become a pacifist and a [[conscientious objector]].<ref>Barrett 2007, p. 84.</ref>  He also began a campaign of small acts of [[sabotage]], introducing minor errors into his trajectory calculations so as to mistarget the guns, such that they "never once hit an inhabited target" on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate.<ref>Barrett 2007, p. 87.</ref> His actions were never discovered by his superiors.  

Skirth remained in Italy until February 1919,<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.297.</ref> aside from a fortnight of leave back in England in November and December 1918.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.280.</ref> He received the [[British War Medal]] and [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] for his war service<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=5381810|title=Medal card of Skirth, John B (sic)|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view pdf image of original medal card|accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref>  but declined the [[Military Medal]], which he felt was offered as part of an attempt to whitewash a fatal accident he had tried to prevent.<ref>Barrett 2007, p. 89.</ref>

==Later life==
[[Image:Ella Christian Seated cropped (1917).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Ella Christian]]
In September 1919 Skirth returned to England, to commence teacher training<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.333</ref>, for which he had signed up before leaving to serve in the army.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.13</ref> He trained in London, and after graduating taught briefly at a school in [[Bexhill-on-Sea]], before transferring in 1922 to a post at a school in [[Uxbridge]].<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p. 334.</ref>

In 1923 he and Ella Christian became engaged and the following year, after Skirth secured a job at the Little Ealing Senior Boys' School and found a flat they could share in [[Ealing]], they married,<ref>Barrett 2007, p.90.</ref> on 29 December 1924, at the Church of St Barnabus in Bexhill.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, pp.334{{ndash}}335.</ref>  In September 1929 their only child was born, a daughter whom they named Jean. (They had expected a boy, who would have been called John.)<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.338.</ref>  

During the [[Second World War]], the family was evacuated to South Wales with Skirth<U+2019>s school.  In his forties by this point and suffering from ill health, he was not expected to fight,<ref name="Anon">{{citation

|url=http://www.bexhillobserver.net/news/bexhill-news/flanders_turned_ronald_into_the_reluctant_tommy_1_1402407}}</ref> but his anti-war views earned him the labels "crank, visionary, communistic and impractical".<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.344.</ref> 

After the war, the family returned to Ealing, where Skirth and his wife Ella lived, in various homes, throughout their life together,<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, pp.336, 338</ref> and where he continued to work as a teacher until he took early retirement in 1958.<ref>Barrett 2007, p. 66.</ref> He died there in 1977.<ref name="Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiii">Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiii.</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://search.ancestry.co.uk|title=Index entry<U+2014>Deaths April, May, June 1977<U+2014>Skirth John Ronald, Hounslow 13 1184|accessdate=25 October 2010|work=England & Wales, Death Index: 1916-2005 |publisher=Ancestry.co.uk}}</ref>

==Character and beliefs==

A self-confessed 'dreamer' with a romantic sensibility, Skirth was very fond of literature, and in particular poetry; he took with him to the [[Western Front]] a much-annotated copy of [[Francis Turner Palgrave]]'s ''[[Golden Treasury]]''. His favourite poets were [[John Keats]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[Lord Byron]].<ref>Barrett 2007, p. 68.</ref> He had an intense love of beauty, which he found all around him in music, architecture and the natural world.  On the Western Front, he wrote, he was "deprived of the one thing that to me was as precious as life itself, my love of beauty".<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.130.</ref>

Although Skirth had requested expedited call-up in 1916 as an idealistic [[patriotism|patriot]], convinced that "King and Country" were causes worth fighting for,<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.24.</ref>  it was not long before he became disillusioned with the war and the army.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.75.</ref> He attributed this to a combination of his sensitive character, his Christian upbringing and sense of right and wrong, and, most significantly, the horror of his war experiences.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, pp.345, 351.</ref>  

After the war, Skirth remained a convinced [[pacifist]] for the rest of his life.  He believed that Britain should not have declared war on [[Germany]] in 1939 and claimed that he would rather surrender and face [[military occupation|occupation]] than take up arms against a hostile force.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.351.</ref>  Writing in the early 1970s, he expressed hope that the next generation of political leaders would not make the same mistakes as their forebears.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, pp.352{{ndash}}353.</ref>

==Memoir==
[[image:Ronald Skirth's journal.jpg|One of the five green ring binders in which Skirth wrote his memoir|thumb|left]]

In January 1971, having retired from his teaching career, Skirth began work on a handwritten memoir which described his conduct and experiences during the [[First World War]], and in particular his experience of disillusionment.  Although he initially intended to focus on his relationship with his wife Ella, touching on the war only briefly, he soon felt under a "compulsion" to write more about his war experiences.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.x.</ref>  He worked on the memoir for over a year, eventually filling five green [[ring binder]]s with many hundreds of pages, and over the next few years, despite suffering two [[stroke]]s, he repeatedly went back to the material, editing, amending and adding to what he had written.<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xii.</ref>

Skirth gave the memoir to his daughter Jean in 1975, two years before his death in 1977<ref name="Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiii"/> Although for many years she found it too upsetting to read in full, she felt that it was a story that should be shared with others, and in 1999 she donated four of the five ring binders, containing the bulk of the memoir but excluding its more personal sections, to the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London,<ref name="Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiv">Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiv.</ref> where they remain to this day.<ref>[http://www.iwmcollections.org.uk/|Imperial War Museum collections]</ref>
[[image:Imperial War Museum Front.JPG|The Imperial War Museum, London|thumb|right]]

Once it was made available to researchers and academics, Skirth's memoir began to attract attention, and his story was featured in Richard Schweitzer's ''The Cross and the Trenches'' (2003), Michele Barrett's ''Casualty Figures'' (2007), and in [[Ian Hislop]]'s documentary ''[[Not Forgotten (TV)|Not Forgotten]]: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight'' (2008), in which Hislop interviewed Jean Skirth about her father's war experiences.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/not-forgotten/episode-guide/series-3/episode-1 ''Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight''], Series 3, Episode 1/1, Channel 4, 10 November 2008.</ref>

===Publication===
In 2010 the memoir was published in book form by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], as ''The Reluctant Tommy: Ronald Skirth's Extraordinary Memoir of the First World War'', edited by Duncan Barrett.  Barrett wrote in an introduction that he felt that Skirth's story "deserved as wide an audience as possible<U+2014>and to be read in its protagonist's own words".<ref name="Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xv">Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xv.</ref>  Skirth's daughter Jean, who had given permission for the memoir to be published<ref name="Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xv"/> remained uncertain whether publishing the memoir was what her father would have wanted,<ref name="Anon"/> but believed that it was important that his story was widely known.<ref name="Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiv"/> 
The book carried a foreword by [[Channel 4 News]] anchor [[Jon Snow]], in which he wrote about his grandfather [[Lieutenant-General]] Sir [[Thomas D'Oyly Snow]]. Referring to the popular description of the lower ranks as "[[lions led by donkeys]]", Snow acknowledged that "If Ronald Skirth was a 'lion', Thom Snow was ultimately a 'donkey'."<ref>Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.viii.</ref>

{{quote|text=[An] important contribution to the literature of the war ... a remorseless condemnation of war and support for the stance of the absolute pacifist ... I would certainly buy this book even if I had not been sent a review copy, and whenever I get too misty-eyed about officer-man relationships I shall reread it to remind me of how badly things could go wrong. And of just how vital it is, for any democratic society seeking to use war as an instrument of policy, to ensure that the connection between war's means and its political ends is crystal clear.|sign=[[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]]|source=''Evening Standard''<ref name=Holmes/>}}

{{quote|text=Skirth<U+2019>s writing may be uneven but it carries the unmistakable tenor of honesty and true belief, not least in his disgust at the behaviour of many of his superiors. His descriptions of seeing his friends gassed and blown to bits are moving as much for what he can<U+2019>t bring himself to write, as for what he can.
