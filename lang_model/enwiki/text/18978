'''Ramesses II''' (also known as '''Ramesses the Great''' and alternatively [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] as '''Ramses''' and '''Rameses''' {{unicode|''*Ri<U+0295>m<U+012B>sisu''}}) was an [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]] of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth dynasty]]. He is often regarded as Egypt<U+00B4>s greatest and most powerful pharaoh<ref>James Putnan,An introduction to egyptology,1990</ref><ref>Joyce Tyldesley, Ramesses: Egypt's Greatest Pharaoh, Viking/Penguin Books (2000),</ref>. 
He was born ca. [[1302 BC]]. At age fourteen, Ramesses was appointed Prince Regent by his father [[Seti I]]<ref>James Putnan,An introduction to egyptology,1990</ref>. He is believed to have taken the throne in his early 20s and to have ruled Egypt from [[1279 BC]] to [[1213 BC]]<ref>Michael Rice, Who's Who in Ancient Egypt, Routledge, 1999</ref> for a total of 66 years and 2 months. He was once said to have lived to be 99 years old, but it is more likely that he died in his 90th or 92nd year. [[Hellenic Civilization|Ancient Greek]] writers such as [[Herodotus]] attributed his accomplishments to the semi-mythical [[Sesostris]], and he is traditionally believed to have been the Pharaoh of [[the Exodus]] due to a tradition started by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]. If he became king in 1279 BC as most Egyptologists today believe, he would have assumed the throne on [[May 31]], [[1279 BC]] based on his known accession date of '''III Shemu day 27'''.<ref>J. von Beckerath, ''Chronologie des Pharaonischen <U+00C4>gypten'', Mainz, (1997), pp.108 & 190</ref><ref>Peter J. Brand, The Monuments of Seti I: Epigraphic, Historical and Art Historical Analysis, Brill, NV Leiden (2000), pp.302-305</ref> He also transported the Egyptian capital from [[Thebes]] to [[Avaris|Ra'amses]] in the Delta.

==Naming==
As with most [[pharaoh]]s, Ramesses had a number of royal names. The two most important, his ''prenomen'' (regnal name) and ''nomen'' (birth name) are shown in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s above to the right. These names are [[Transliteration of ancient Egyptian|transliterated]] as wsr-m3<U+2018>t-r<U+2018>&ndash;stp-n-r<U+2018> r<U+2018>-ms-sw&ndash;mry-<U+1EC9>-mn, which is usually written as ''Usermaatra-setepenra Ramessu-meryamen''. It translates as "Powerful one of [[Ma'at]], the Justice of [[Ra]] is Powerful, chosen of Ra, Ra bore him, beloved of [[Amun]]". In the [[Hittites|Hittite]] copy of the above-mentioned peace treaty with Hattusilis, the Pharaoh's name appears as ''Washmuaria Shatepnaria Riamashesha Maiamana''. Some scholars believe this is possibly a closer approximation of the actual vocalization of the Egyptian king's name.

==Life==
[[Image:Kadesh.jpg|left|thumb|Tablet of [[treaty]] between [[Hattusili III]] of [[Hatti]] and Ramesses II of [[Egypt]], at the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]].]]
Ramesses II was the third king of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]], and the second son of [[Seti I]] and his [[Queen Tuya]]. Ramesses' older brother (perhaps ''Neb-en-khaset-neb'') predeceased him before adulthood. The most memorable of Ramesses' wives was [[Nefertari]]. Earlier wives, among others, of this king were [[Isetnofret]] and [[Maathorneferure]]<ref>Wolfram Grajetzki, Ancient Egyptian Queens, Golden House, 2005</ref>, Princess of [[Hatti]]. The writer [[Terence Gray]] stated in [[1923]] that Ramesses II had as many as 20 sons and 20 daughters but scholars today believe his offspring numbered almost a hundred in total. In 2004, Dodson and Hilton noted that the monumental evidence "seems to indicate that Ramesses II had around 100 children--[with] 48-50 sons and 40-53 daughters."<ref>Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, Thames & Hudson (2004), p.166</ref> His children include [[Bintanath]] and [[Meritamen]] (princesses and their father's wives), Sethnakhte, [[Amun-her-khepeshef]] the king's first born son, [[Merneptah]] (who would eventually succeed him as Ramesses' 13th son), and Prince [[Khaemweset]]. Ramesses II's second born son, [[Ramesses B]]--sometimes called Ramesses Junior--became the crown prince from Year 25 to Year 50 of his father's reign after the death of Amen-her-khepesh.<ref>Dodson & Hilton, op. cit., p.173</ref> 

In his Year 2, Ramesses II decisively defeated the [[Shardana]] or Sherden sea pirates who were wreaking havoc along Egypt's Mediterranean coast by attacking cargo-ladden vessels travelling the sea routes to Egypt.<ref>N. Grimal, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1992) pp.250-253</ref> The Sherden people came from the coast of [[Ionia]] or south-west Turkey, more likely Ionia. Ramesses posted troops and ships at strategic points along the coast and patiently allowed the pirates to attack their prey before skillfully catching them by surprise in a sea battle and capturing them all in one fell swoop.<ref>Joyce Tyldesley, ''Ramesses: Egypt's Greatest Pharaoh'', Viking/Penguin Books (2000), pp.53</ref>  Ramesses would soon incorporate these skilled mercenaries into his army where they were to play a pivotal role at the battle of Kadesh. As king, Ramesses II led several expeditions north into the lands east of the [[Mediterranean]] (the location of the modern [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]).

==Min festival==

This is an ancient festival, dating back to pre-dynastic Egypt,[http://www.thekeep.org/~kunoichi/kunoichi/themestream/min.html] though it was still popular at the time of Ramesses II. It was connected with the worshiping of the king and was carried out in the last month of the summer.<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref> The festival was carried out by the king himself, followed by his wife, royal family, and [[noble court|court]]<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. When the king entered the [[sanctuary]] of the god [[Min (god)|Min]], he brought [[offering]]s and burning incences<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Then, the standing god was carried out of the [[temple]] on a shield carried by 22 priests<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. In front of the statue of the god there were also two small seated statues of the pharaoh. In front of the god Min there was a  large ceremonial procession that included dancers and priests. In front of them was a king with a white bull that was wearing a solar disc between its horns<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. When the god arrived at the end of the procession, he is given sacrificial offerings from the [[pharaoh]]. At the end of the [[festival]] the pharaoh was given a bundle of  [[cereal]] that symbolised [[fertility]]<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>.

==Battle of Kadesh==
[[Image:Ramses II at Kadesh.jpg|220px|thumb|Ramses atop [[chariot]], at the [[Battle of Kadesh]], in a relief inside his [[Abu Simbel]] temple.]]
After some preparations, Ramesses decided to attack territory in the Levant which belonged to a more substantial enemy: the Hittite Empire.  At the [[Battle of Kadesh|Second Battle of Kadesh]] in May 1274 BC towards the end of the Fourth year of his reign, Egyptian forces under his leadership marched through the coastal road through Canaan and south Syria through the [[Bekaa Valley]] and approached Kadesh from the south..<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', p.68</ref>  Ramesses planned to seize the citadel of Kadesh which belonged to king [[Muwatallis]] of the [[Hittite Empire]]. The battle almost turned into a disaster as Ramesses was initially tricked by two Bedouin spies in the pay of the Hittites to believe that Muwatallis and his massive army were still 120 miles north of Kadesh. Ramesses II only learned of the true nature of his dire predicament when a subsequent pair of Hittite spies were captured, beaten and forced to reveal the truth before him: 

{{cquote|When they had been brought before Pharaoh, His Majesty asked, 'Who are you?' They replied 'We belong to the king of [[Hatti]]. He has sent us to spy on you.' Then His Majesty said to them, 'Where is he, the enemy from Hatti? I had heard that he was in the land of Khaleb, north of Tunip.' They replied to His Majesty, 'Lo, the king of [[Hatti]] has already arrived, together with the many countries who are supporting him...  They are armed with their infantry and their [[chariot]]s. They have their weapons of war at the ready. They are more numerous than the grains of sand on the beach. Behold, they stand equipped and ready for battle behind the old city of [[Kadesh]].' <ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', pp.70-71</ref>}}

Ramesses had fallen into a well-laid trap by Muwatallis whose thousands of infantry and chariotry were hidden well behind the eastern bank of the [[Orontes]] river under the command of the king's brother, [[Hattusili III]]. The Egyptian army itself had been divided into two main forces &ndash; the Re and Amun brigades with Ramesses and the Ptah and Seth brigades &ndash; separated from each other by forests and the far side of the Orontes river.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', pp.70-73</ref> The Re brigade was almost totally destroyed by the surprise initial Hittite chariot attack and Ramesses II had barely enough time to rally his own Amun brigade and secure reinforcements from the Ptah Army Brigade (who were just arriving upon the scene of battle) to turn the tide of battle against the Hittites. While Ramesses II had in theory 'won' the battle, Muwatallis had effectively won the war. Ramesses was compelled to retreat south with the Hittite commander [[Hattusili III]] relentlessly harrying the Egyptian forces through the Bekaa Valley; the Egyptian province of Upi was also captured according to the Hittite records at [[Boghazkoy]]. <ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', p.73</ref>

==Aftermath==
Egypt's sphere of influence was now restricted to Canaan while Syria fell into Hittite hands. Over the ensuing years, Rameses II would return to campaign against the Hittites and even achieved several spectacular victories (at a time of Hittite weakness due to a dispute over Muwatallis' succession) to briefly capture the cities of [[Tunip]], where no Egyptian soldier had been seen since the time of [[Thutmose III]] almost 120 years previously and even Kadesh in his 8th and 9th Years.<ref>Grimal, op. cit., pp. 256f.</ref> However, neither power could decisively defeat the other in battle. Consequently, in the twenty-first year of his reign ([[1258 BC]]), Ramses decided to conclude an agreement with the new Hittite king at Kadesh, Hattusili III, to end the conflict. The ensuing document is the earliest known [[peace treaty]] in world history. 

Ramesses II also campaigned south of the [[Aswan|first cataract]] into [[Nubia]]. He constructed many impressive monuments, including the renowned archeological complex of [[Abu Simbel]], and the [[mortuary temple]] known as the [[Ramesseum]]. It is said that there are more statues of him in existence than of any other Egyptian pharaoh <ref>[http://touregypt.net/featurestories/ramesses2intro.htm Ramesses II (touregypt.net)]</ref>, not surprising as he was the second-longest reigning Pharaoh of Egypt after [[Pepi II]]. Rameses may have used art as a means of propaganda and his victories over foreigners are depicted on numerous temple reliefs while he had more colossal statues than any other pharaoh. He also usurped many existing statues by inscribing his own [[cartouche]] on them. Many of these building projects date from his early years and it appears that there was considerable economic decline towards the end of his long 66-year reign. The colossal [[statue of Ramesses II]] was reconstructed and erected on Ramses Square in Cairo in [[1955]].
<br clear=all> In August 2006, contractors moved the 3,200-year-old statue of him from Ramesses Square to save it from exhaust fumes that were causing the 83-ton statue to deteriorate.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5282414.stm]</ref> The statue was originally taken from a temple in Memphis. The new site will be located near the future [[Grand Egyptian Museum]].

==Building activity and monuments==

In contrast to the buildings of other pharaohs, many of the monuments from the reign of Ramesses II are well preserved. There are accounts of his glory hewn on stone, statues, remains of palaces and temples,most notable the [[Ramesseum]] in the western [[Thebes]] and the rock temples of [[Abu Simbel]]. He covered the land from the [[Delta]] to [[Nubia]] with buildings in a way no [[king]] before him had done<ref>Wolfhart Westendorf,Das alte <U+00E4>gypten,1969</ref>.

===Ramesseum===
[[Image:Ramesseum-Cour et Colosse.jpg|320px|thumb|[[Ramesseum]] courtyard]]
Ever since the 19th century, the temple complex, called Ramesseum, built by Ramesses II, between Gurnah and the desert has been known by this name. The greek [[historian]] [[Diodorus Siculo]] marveled at his gigantic and famous temple which is now no more than a few ruins.

Oriented northwest and southeast, the temple itself was preceded by two courts. An enormous pylon stood before the first court, with the royal palace at the left and the gigantic statue of the king looming up at the back<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Only fragments of the base and torso remain of the syenite statue of the enthroned pharaoh, 17 meters high and weighing more than 1000 tons. The scenes of the great pharaoh and his army triumphing over the Hittite forces fleeing before [[Kadesh]], represented in line with the canons of the "epic poem of Pentaur", can still be made out of the pylon<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Remains of the second court include part of the internal facade of the pylon and a portion of the Osiride portico on the right<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Scenes of [[war]] and the  rout  the [[Hittites]] at Kadesh are repeated on the walls<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. In the upper registers, feast and honor of the phallic god [[Min]], god of fertility<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. On the opposite side of the court the few Osiride pillars and columns still left can furnish an idea of the original grandeur<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Scattered remains of the two statues of the seated king can also be seen, one in pink granite and the other in black granite, which once flanked the entrance to the [[temple]]<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Thirty-nine out of the forty-eight columns in the great [[hypostyle hall]] (m 41x 31) still stand in the central rows. They are decorated with the usual scenes of the king before various gods. Part of the ceiling decorated with gold stars on a blue ground has also been preserved<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. The sons and daughters of Ramesses appear in the procession on the few walls left. The sanctuary was composed of three consecutive rooms, with eight columns and the tetrastyle cell<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Part of the first room, with the ceiling decorated with astral scenes, and few remains of the second room are all that is left. Vast storerooms built in mud bricks stretched out around the temple<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Traces of a school for scribes were found among the ruins. 

A temple of [[Seti I]], of which nothing is now left but the foundations, once stood to the right of the hypostyle hall. It consisted of a peristyle court with two chapel shrines. The entire complex was enclosed in mud brick walls which started at the gigantic southeast pylon.

===Abu Simbel===

The great temple of Ramesses II at [[Abu Simbel]] was discovered in 1813 by the famous Swiss Orientalist and traveler [[Ludwig Burckhardt]], who is also credited with having found the city of [[Petra]] in Jordan. However, four years passed before anyone could enter the temple, because an enormous pile of sand almost completely covered the facade and its colossal statues, blocking the entranceway .This feat  was achieved by the great Paduan explorer [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni]], who managed to penetrate the interior on 4 August 1817<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>.[[Image:Abou Simbel.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Abu Simbel]] colossus]]

The Great Temple at Abu Simbel,which took about twenty years to build was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great(which corresponds to 1265 BC). It was dedicated to the gods [[Amun Ra]], [[Ra Harakhti]], and [[Ptah]], as well as to the deified Ramesses himself<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>.

Four colossal 20 meter statues of the pharaoh with the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt decorate the facade of the temple which is 35 meters wide and is toped by a frieze with 22 baboons, worshippers of the sun and flank the entrance<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. This latter is crowned by a basrelief representing two images of the king worshiping Ra Harakhti, whose statue stands in a large niche<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. The god ids holding the hieroglyph user in his right hand and a feather ( [[Maat]],goddess of truth and justice) in his left; this is nothing less than a gigantic cryptogram for Ramesses II`s throne nane, User-Maat-Re. Nex to the legs of the colossi there are other statues no higher than the knees of the pharaoh<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. These depict [[Nefertari]], Ramesses`s chief wife and queen mother Mut-Tuy, princes [[Amun-her-khepeshef]]  and Ramesses, and princesses Bint-Anath, Nebttawi and Merytamun. 

The temple is complex in structure and quite unusual because of many side chambers. The hypostayle hall (sometimes also called pronaos) is 18 meters long and 16,7 meters wide and is supported by eight huge Osirid pillars depicting the deified Ramesses linked to the god [[Osiris]], the god of the Underworld, to indicate the everlasting nature of the pharaoh. The colossal statues along the left-hand wall  bear the white crown of [[Upper Egypt]], while those on the opposite side are wearing the double crown of Upper and [[Lower Egypt]](pschent)<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>.  The bas-reliefs on the walls of the pronaos depict battle scenes in the military campaigns the ruler waged. Much of the sculpture is given to the [[Battle of Kadesh]], on the Orontes river in present-day [[Syria]], in which the Egyptian king fought against the [[Hittites]]<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. The most famous relief shows the king on his chariot shooting [[arrow]]s against his  fleeing enemies, who are being taken prisoners<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. From the hypostayle hall, one enters the second pillared hall, which has four pillars decorated with beautiful scenes of offerings to the gods. This hall gives access to a transverse vestibule in the middle of which is the entrance to the sanctuary. Here, on a black wall, are rock cut sculptures of four seated figures: [[Ra Harakhti]], the deified king Rameses,and the gods [[Amun Ra]] and [[Ptah]]. [[Ra Harakhti]], [[Amun Ra]] and [[Ptah]] were the main divinities in that period  and their cult centers were at [[Heliopolis]], [[Thebes]] and [[Memphis]] respectively<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. 

The axis of the temple was positioned by the  ancient Egyptian architects so that twice a year<U+2014>October 20 and February 20<U+2014>the rays of sun worshiped by the 22 baboons would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculpture on the back wall, except for the statue of [[Ptah]], the god  connected with the [[Underworld]], who always remained in dark<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref><ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. It is quite logical to assume that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the [[pharaoh]]'s rule. In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the heliacal rising of the star [[Sirius]] (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramesses Great could take his place next to [[Amun Ra]] and [[Ra Harakhti]]<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>.<!-- Needs clarification: is it actually Oct 20 or 22? When was the other date determined, and why was it thought to be the right date?  -->

The temple of [[Hathor]] and [[Nefertari]], also known as the Small Temple, was built about one hundred meters northeast of the temple of Ramesses II and was dedicated to the goddess [[Hathor]] and Ramesses II`s chief consort, Nefertari. This was in fact the first time in ancient [[Egyptian history]] that a temple was dedicated to a queen<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. The rock-cut facade is decorated with two groups of colossi that are separated by the large gateway. The statues, slightly more than ten meters high, are of the king and his queen. On the other side of the portal are two statues of the king, wearing the [[white crown]] of [[Upper Egypt]] (south colossus) and the [[double crown]] (north colossus); these are flanked by statues of the queen and the king. What is truly surprising is that for the only time in [[Egyptian art]], the statues of the king and his consort are equal in size<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. Traditionally, the statues of the queens stood next to those of the [[pharaoh]], but were never taller than his knees. This exception to such a long standing rule bears witness to the special importance attached to Nefertari by Ramesses, who went to [[Abu Simbel]] with his beloved wife in the 24th year of his reign. As the Great temple of the king, there are small statues of princes and princesses next to their parents. In this case they are positioned symmetrically: on the south side (at left as you face the gateway) are, from left to right, princes Meryatum and Meryre, princesses Merytamun and Henttawi, and princes Rahirwenemef and [[Amun-her-khepeshef]], while on the north side the same figures are in reverse order. The plan of the Small Temple is very simplified version of that of the Great Temple.
[[Image:SethAndHorusAdoringRamsses.JPG|300px|thumb|The gods [[Seth]] (left) and [[Horus]] (right) adoring Ramesses in the small temple at [[Abu Simbel]]
]]

As the larger temple dedicated to the king, the hypostayle hall or [[pronaos]] is supported by six [[pillar]]s; in this case, however, they are not Osirid pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sinistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the [[god]]s [[Horus]], [[Khnum]], [[Khonsu]], and [[Thoth]], and the [[goddess]]es [[Hathor]], [[Isis]], [[Maat]], Mut of Asher, [[Satis]] and [[Taweret]]; in one scene Ramesses is presenting [[flower]]s or[[ burning incense]]<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. The capitals of the pillars bear the face of the goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the [[king]], the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in this scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddess [[Hathor]] and [[Mut]]<ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, acces to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this [[chamber]] there are two graceful and poetic bes-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting [[papyrus]] plants to [[Hathor]], who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a thicket of papyri. On the west wall, Ramesses II and Nefertari are making offerings to god [[Horus]] and the divinities of the Cataracts - [[Satis]], [[Anubis]] and [[Khnum]].

The rock cut [[sanctuary]] and the two side [[chambers]] are connected to the transverse vestibule and are aligned with the axis of the temple. The bas-reliefs on the side walls of the small sanctuary represent scenes of [[offering]]s to various [[god]]s made either by the [[pharaoh]] or the [[queen]]<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. On the back wall,which lies to the west along the axis of the [[temple]], there is a niche in which [[Hathor]] as a divine cow seems to be coming out of the [[mountain]]: the goddess is depicted as the [[Mistress]] of the temple dedicated to her and to queen [[Nefertari]], who is intimately linked to the [[goddess]]<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>.

==Mummy==
He was buried in the [[Valley of the Kings]], in [[KV7]], but his [[mummy]] was later moved to the [[DB320|mummy cache]] at [[Deir el-Bahri]], where it was found in [[1881]].  In 1885 it was placed in [[Cairo]]'s [[Egyptian Museum]], where it remains [[as of 2007]]. 

Ramesses' mummy features a hooked nose and strong jaw, and is of above average height for an ancient Egyptian, standing some five feet, seven inches.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'' p. 14</ref> He had red hair. In his last years, he suffered from [[arthritis]], tooth [[cavity|cavities]] and poor [[circulation]]. <ref>[http://library.thinkquest.org/C0116982/HTML%20page%20folder/hramses.htm Ramses II (thinkquest.org)]</ref> His successor was ultimately to be his thirteenth son; [[Merneptah]].

In 1974, [[Cairo Museum]] [[Egyptologist]]s noticed that the mummy's condition was rapidly deteriorating. They decided to fly Rameses II's mummy to [[Paris]] for examination. Ramses II was issued an Egyptian passport that listed his occupation as "King (deceased)." According to a Discovery Channel documentary, the mummy was received at a Paris airport with the full military honours befitting a king. 

In Paris, Ramses' mummy was diagnosed and treated for a [[fungal]] infection. During the examination, scientific analysis revealed battle [[wound]]s and old [[fracture]]s, as well as the pharaoh's arthritis and poor circulation. After Ramesses' mummy had been returned to Egypt, it was visited by the late President [[Anwar Sadat]] and his wife.

==Tomb KV5==
In 1995, Professor [[Kent Weeks]], head of the Theban Mapping Project rediscovered Tomb [[KV5]]. It has proven to be the largest tomb in the Valley of the Kings which originally contained the mummified remains of some of this king's estimated 52 sons. Approximately 150 corridors and tomb chambers have been located in this tomb as of 2006 and the tomb may contain as many as 200 corridors and chambers.<ref>[http://www.narmer.pl/kv/kv05en.htm]</ref> It is believed that at least 4 of Ramesses' sons including Meryatum, Sety, [[Amun-her-khepeshef]] (Ramesses' first born son) and "the King's Principal Son of His Body, the Generalissimo Ramesses, justified" (ie: deceased) were buried there from inscriptions, ostracas or canopic jars discovered in the tomb.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', p.161-162</ref> [[Joyce Tyldesley]] writes that thus far 
: "no intact burials have been discovered and there have been little substantial funeral debris: thousands of potsherds, faience ''shabti'' figures, beads, amulets, fragments of Canopic jars, of wooden coffins...but no intact sarcophagi, mummies or mummy cases, suggesting that much of the tomb may have been unused. Those burials which were made in KV5 were thoroughly looted in antiquity, leaving little or no remains."<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', p.161-162</ref>

==Tomb of Nefertari==
[[Image:Maler der Grabkammer der Nefertari 004.jpg|300px|thumb|Tomb wall depicting [[Nefertari]]]]
The tomb of [[Nefertari]], the most important and famous [[consort]] of Ramesses was discovered by [[Ernesto Schiaparelli]] in 1904<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref><ref>Ania Skliar, Grosse kulturen der welt-<U+00C4>gypten, 2005</ref>. Although it had been looted in ancient times, the tomb of Nefertari is extremely important, because its magnificent wall painting decoration is surely to be regarded as one of the greatest achievements of ancient [[Egyptian art]]<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. A flight of steps cut out of the rock gives access to the antechamber, which is decorated with paintings based on Chapter 17 of the [[Book of the Dead]]<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. This astronomical ceiling represents the heavens and is painted in dark blue, with a myriad of golden five-pointed stars. The east wall of the antechamber is interrupted by a large opening flanked by representation of [[Osiris]] at left and [[Anubis]] at right; this in turn leads to the side chamber, decorated with offering scenes, preceded by a vestibule in which the paintings portray [[Nefertari]] being presented to the gods who welcome her. On the north wall of the antechamber is the stairway that goes down to the burial chamber<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. This latter is a vast quadrengular room covering a surface area about 90 square meters, the astronomical ceiling of which is supported by four pillars entirely covered with decoration. Originaly, the queen<U+00B4>s red [[granite]] [[sarcophagus]] lay in the middle of this chamber<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>. According to religious doctrines of the time, it was in this chamber, which the ancient Egyptians called the "golden hall" that the regeneration of the deceased took place. This decorative pictogram of the walls in the burial chamber drew inspirations from chapters 144 and 146 of the [[Book of the Dead]]: in the left half of the chamber, there are passages from chapter 144 concerning the gates and doors of the kingdom of [[Osiris]], their guardians, and the magic formulas that had to be uttered by the deceased in order to go past the doors<ref>Alberto Siliotti, Egypt: temples, people, gods,1994</ref>.

==Pharaoh of Exodus?==

At least as early as [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], Ramesses II was identified with the pharaoh of whom the [[Biblical]] figure [[Moses]] demanded his people be released from [[slavery]].

This identification has been occasionally disputed but the evidence for another solution is inconclusive: 

* Ramesses II was not drowned in the Sea and the biblical account makes no specific claim that the pharaoh was with his army when they were "swept ... into the sea." In fact, Jewish tradition appears to indicate that Pharaoh was the only Egyptian to survive the Red Sea, and later became the King of [[Nineveh]] in the [[Book of Jonah]].<ref>Exodus 14</ref>   

* There is nothing in the archaeological records from the time of his reign to confirm the existence of the Plagues of Egypt. This is not surprising since few pharaohs wished to record natural disasters or military defeats (as documented in the Biblical narratives) in the same manner that their rivals documented these events. In addition, no reference to any setbacks were made in royal Egyptian textual records or within the large number of informal Egyptian texts still in existence. For instance, after the serious Egyptian setback at the [[Battle of Kadesh]], Hittites archives uncovered in [[Boghazkoy]], the capital of Hatti, reveal that "a humiliated Ramesses [was] forced to retreat from Kadesh in ignominious defeat" and abandon the border provinces of Amurru and Upi to the control of his Hittite rival without the benefit of a formal truce.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', p.73</ref> Benteshina, the ruler of Amurru who had been Ramesses' ally at Kadesh was deposed and swiftly marched off to Boghazkoy to face an uncertain fate while the Hittite hold over Kadesh was reinforced.  By contrast, in Ramesses II's version of events, the Pharaoh fictitiously  states--just a day after his narrow escape from death in battle--that "the cowardly Hittite king sent a letter to the Egyptian camp pleading for peace. Negotiators were summoned and a truce was agreed, although Ramesses, still claiming an Egyptian victory...refused to sign a formal treaty. Ramesses returned home to enjoy his personal triumph, which was to be retold many times in prose, as an epic poem and in relief carving[s]."<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', p.73</ref> No inconvenient references to Ramesses' loss of [[Amurru]] or Upi are preserved in the Egyptian records. 
* The dates now ascribed to Ramesses' reign by most modern scholars might not match the dates when Moses was believed to be in Egypt.

In the 1960's and 1970's, several scholars such as George Mendenhall<ref>Mendenhall, "The Hebrew Conquest of Palestine," ''Biblical Archaeologist'' ('''25''', 1962)</ref> associated the Israelite's arrival in Canaan more closely with the [[Hapiru]] mentioned in the Amarna letters which date to the reign of Amenhotep III and Akhenaten and in the Hittite treaties with Ramesses II. Most scholars today, however, view the Hapiru instead as bandits who attacked the trade and royal caravans that travelled along the coastal roads of Canaan. 
On the other hand, Ramesses' own stele erected in the late 13th century BC in the city known to the Bible as Bet-Shan mentions two conquered peoples who came to "make obeisance to him" in his city of Rameses but mentions neither the building of the city nor, as some have written, the Israelites or Hapiru <ref>Stephen L. Caiger, "Archaeological Fact and Fancy," ''Biblical Archaeologist'', ('''9''', 1946).</ref>.[[Image:Exodus Map.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Poassible map of the [[exodus]]]] 

The Bible states that the Israelites toiled in slavery and built "for Pharaoh supply cities, [[Pithom]] and '''[[Avaris|Ra'amses]]'''" in the Egyptian Delta. <ref>Exodus 1:11</ref> The latter is probably a reference to the city of Pi-Ramesse Aa-nakhtu or the "House of Ramesses, Great-of-Victories" (modern day Qantir) which had been Seti I's summer retreat.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Ramesses'', p.82</ref> Ramesses II greatly enlarged this city both as his principal northern capital and as an important forward base for his military campaigns into the Levant and his control over Canaan. According to [[Kenneth Kitchen]], Pi-Ramesses was largely abandoned from c.[[1130s BC|1130 BC]] onwards; as was often the practice, later rulers removed much of the stone from the city to build the temples of their new capital: [[Tanis]]. <ref>Kitchen, ''On the Reliability of the Old Testament'', William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (2003), p.662. ISBN 0-8028-4960-1,</ref> Therefore, if the identification of the city is correct, it strengthens the case for identifying Ramesses II as the Pharaoh who reigned Egypt during Moses' lifetime. 

His son and successor Merneptah mentions in the so-called [[Merneptah Stele]] that the Ancient Israelites already lived in Canaan during his reign.  Merneptah's reference to their destruction, according to Hasel, probably refers to the Egyptian military strategy of burning towns and their grain storehouses, instead of the destruction of the ethnic group which would either conflict with history or prove that Merneptah learned his propaganda tactics from his father.  Merneptah's inscription uses parallel structures which contrast the Canaanite city-states with the Israelites.  This prompts one to remember that the books of Joshua and Judges both paint pictures of the Israelites as tribes acting independently or in small coalitions against their enemies and wonder how fast they could have coalesced to the point where an ancient and mighty nation such as Egypt would consider them worth mentioning.

Speculation that Ramesses II was the Biblical Pharaoh named ''[[Shishak]]'' who attacked Judah and seized war bounty from Jerusalem in Year 5 of [[Rehoboam]] is untenable because both Ramesses II and his 19th Dynasty successors (ie: Merneptah, Seti II, Siptah & Twosret) retained firm control over Canaan during their reigns. Neither Israel nor Judah could have existed as independent states during this time.

==Fiction==
*The life of Ramesses II has also inspired a large number of [[historical novel]]s, including the five volume series, ''Rams<U+00E8>s,'' by the French writer [[Christian Jacq]]. (Translated editions are available for non-French readers.)
*[[Norman Mailer|Norman Mailer's]] novel ''[[Ancient Evenings]]'' is largely concerned with the life of Ramesses II, though from the perspective of Egyptians living during the reign of Ramesses IX.
*Ramesses was the main character in the [[Anne Rice]] book ''[[The Mummy (novel)|The Mummy]]'' or ''Ramses the Damned''.
*Ramesses was played by [[Yul Brynner]] in the classic film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956). Here Ramesses was portrayed as a vengeful tyrant, ever scornful of his father's preference for Moses over "the son of [his] body".
*In the film ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' Ramesses (voiced by [[Ralph Fiennes]]) is portrayed as Moses' adoptive brother.
*The song "User-Maat-Re" by death metal band [[Nile (band)|Nile]] is about Ramesses II.
*Ramesses II is the inspiration for [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s famous poem [[Ozymandias]].
*An Egyptian pharoah referred to as Ramsesses appeared in an episode of [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]
