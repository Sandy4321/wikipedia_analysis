The '''border disputes''' as well as other unresolved issues between '''Slovenia''' and '''Croatia''' have existed since the independence of the two countries from [[SFR Yugoslavia]] (through the process of [[break-up of Yugoslavia]]), most notably the border issue around the [[Piran Bay]].

The countries have not been able to agree whether international arbitration is required, or what would be its scope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/02/02/nb-03 |title=Croatia again calls for international arbitration to resolve border dispute with Slovenia |publisher=SETimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/03/09/nb-02 |title=Slovenia proposes arbitration for border with Croatia |publisher=SETimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

The situation became more complex when the dispute almost derailed Croatia's application to [[NATO]], if it had not been for Slovenia backing down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8014840.stm |title=Europe &#124; EU calls off talks with Croatia |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-04-23 |accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

The problem escalated during '''Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession''', a roughly ten month time period from December 2008 until September/October 2009, when [[Slovenia]], a [[European Union]] member state, blocked the opening of new [[acquis]] chapters in the negotiation progress of [[Croatia]], an [[Future enlargement of the European Union|EU candidate state]].

An Arbitration Agreement between Croatia and Slovenia was finally signed in Stockholm on 4 November 2009, by both countries' prime ministers as well as the President of the EU.

==Background of the disputes relating to the Gulf of Piran==

=== Origins ===

Following World War II, the area extending from the north of [[Trieste]] to the river [[Mirna River (Croatia)|Mirna]] in the south was a part of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. In 1954, the Territory was dissolved and the area was provisionally divided between Italy and Yugoslavia, and formally annexed by the [[Treaty of Osimo]] in 1975. Territories were divided between Croatia and Slovenia, both constitute members of Yugoslav federation, by [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty (1947)]] and [[London Memorandum|London Memorandum (1954)]] by ethnic principle established by 1945 census. {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} 

In 1991, shortly after both countries declared independence, in the first draft proposal of [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]], Slovenia proposed<ref name="turkalj"/> to establish the borderline in the center of the [[bay of Piran]], which was always the position of the Republic of Croatia. However, Slovenia changed its proposal the following year. A few months later, on 5 June 1992, Slovenia for the first time declared the sovereignty over the entire gulf.<ref name="turkalj"/><!--see page 20: Premda je Slovenija u svom prvom nacrtu sporazuma o zajedni<U+010D>koj granici iz 1991. godine, predlo<U+017E>ila da granica u Piranskom zaljevu ide crtom sredine, ve<U+0107> je idu<U+0107>e godine promijenila svoje stajali<U+0161>te o morskoj granici izme<U+0111>u dviju dr<U+017E>ava. Naime, slovenski ministar vanjskih poslova je 5. lipnja 1992. iznjeo stav o suverenosti Slovenije nad cijelim Zaljevom. --> Since then, Slovenia continued to insist on this position.

The name "Savudrijska vala" ("Bay of Savudria") was first used as a [[toponym]] for the whole bay around the year 2000 (before it was used for just part of it) by local Croatian fishermen and was quickly adopted, first by Croatian journalists, then local authorities, and finally at the state level, leading to publication of official maps to this effect. Such practice is contrary to established practices with long-standing toponyms, and is seen by Slovene authorities as an attempt to imply historical connections with the bay.<ref>Kladnik D., Pipan P. (2008). [http://giam.zrc-sazu.si/index.php?q=en/node/176 "Bay of Piran or Bay of Savudrija? An example of problematic treatment of geographical names"]. ''Acta geographica Slovenica'', '''48'''(1): 57<U+2013>91. {{DOI|id=10.3986/AGS48103}}</ref> Recently a new name has been proposed in Croatia, ''Dragonjski zaljev'' or Bay of Dragonja.

=== Sea dispute ===
Croatia claims that the border line should be equidistant from both shores. The claim is based on the first sentence of the Article 15 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].<ref name="article 15">{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm|title=UN convention of the Law of the Sea, Part II|quote=Article 15: 'Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however, where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way which is at variance therewith.'}}</ref>
It states that a coastal state is able to assert its exclusive right to manage all natural resources in a band up to {{convert|200|nmi|km}} from its shore (an 'exclusive economic zone').<ref>http://civilitasresearch.org/publications/view_article.cfm?article_id=50</ref>

"''Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured''".<ref name="article 15">
{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part2.htm|title=UN convention of the Law of the Sea, Part II|quote=Article 15: 'Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent to each other, neither of the two States is entitled, failing agreement between them to the contrary, to extend its territorial sea beyond the median line every point of which is equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial seas of each of the two States is measured. The above provision does not apply, however, where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way which is at variance therewith.'}}</ref>
Slovenian authorities cite the full quote of the sentence in Article 15, which says: "''The above provision does not apply, however, where it is necessary by reason of historic title or other special circumstances to delimit the territorial seas of the two States in a way which is at variance therewith''", stating it is applicable in this case. The Law of the Sea also states that the international waters begin {{convert|12|nmi|km}} from the shore of the country <U+2013> while the international waters are {{convert|15|mi|km}} away from the Slovenian shore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fni.no/doc&pdf/FNI-R1208.pdf |title=The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the EU and the Rule of Law - What is going on in the Adriatic Sea? |publisher=Fridtjof Nanses Institutt |year=2008|accessdate=19 September 2010}}</ref><ref>Currently, the distance of the Slovenian coast, and any related baseline, from the nearest point of the Croatian Zone (i.e., the nearest high seas, before the Zone was proclaimed in 2003) exceeds 12 nm.72 In fact, the distance is 15.5 nm as measured between Point 5 at sea and the nearest point on the Slovenian coast</ref>

When Slovenia notified the [[United Nations Secretariat|UN Secretariat]] in 1995 of its succession to Yugoslavia's ratification of the Convention, it included a note saying that this system of exclusive economic zones has become part of [[international law]] and asserted its rights as a geographically disadvantaged state.<ref>http://www.fni.no/doc&pdf/FNI-R1208.pdf</ref>  Although the convention does make it clear that any decision to declare an exclusive economic zone should be made in co-operation with all interested parties, Croatian sources claim that Slovenia's self-description as a geographically disadvantaged state amounts to an admission that it is a country without access to international waters.<ref>http://www.vjesnik.hr/pdf/2003%5C10%5C09%5C07A7.PDF</ref>  

Slovenian claims are based on the Article 15 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as well; however, its second sentence, which stipulates historical claims and control of the seas supersedes other claims. According to Slovenia, [[Savudrija]] was associated with [[Piran]] (which had an Italian majority at that time) for centuries, and Slovenia claims that its police controlled the entire gulf between 1954 and 1991.<ref name="AvbeljLetnar2007">{{cite journal|author=Avbelj M. & Letnar <U+010C>erni<U+010D> J.|year=2007|url= http://www.pennjil.com/jilp/5-1_Cernic_Jernej_Letnar.pdf|title=The conundrum of the Piran bay: Slovenia v.

[[File:ZERP.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Area of proclaimed Croatian ZERP in the Adriatic.<br>Note the contact between Croatian and Italian territorial waters in the south-central Adriatic]]
Slovenia also claims the right to access international waters. Slovenian claims are based on the argument that the country had free access to the international waters while being part of Yugoslavia. Due to the statements of Croatian negotiators, Slovenian politicians have also presented the concern that without territorial connection with the international waters, Croatia could limit "harmless passage" to its ports (contrary to international agreements and practice), which would complicate Slovenia's sovereignty at sea and could cause economic damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200126/clanek/hrvaska/|title=Nuklearni pristop|author=Mekina I.|publisher=Mladina|page=26|language=Slovenian}}</ref> Because of these concerns, Slovenia invokes the principle of equity due to unfortunate geographic conditions.<ref name="AvbeljLetnar2007"/> 

However, the Croatian side further asserts that the corridor in the Croatian waters would be useless for traffic, since traffic regulations in the Gulf of Trieste allows only incoming traffic on the Croatian side of the border, while outgoing traffic must go through Italian waters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DyiG-0tB5ZQ/SVDwrs6dufI/AAAAAAAAAA8/rWarsbC1NRE/s1600-h/trscanski_zaljev.jpg|title=Maritime traffic regulations in the Gulf of Trieste}}</ref> The Slovenian response is that Slovenia's access to international waters is not an exclusively practical or commercial issue; it is rather the logical consequence of the fact that Slovenia is said to be an internationally recognised maritime country with granted access to international seas. The latter assertion has been repeatedly disputed by the Croatian side.

Croatia wants to solve this dispute only by certain articles of international law, excluding the principle "[[ex aequo et bono]]", on whose inclusion in the process the Slovenian side insists.<ref>http://www.axisglobe.com/article.asp?article=766</ref> The point of dispute between the countries is also regarding the question whether the legal principle "[[ex aequo et bono]]" itself also constitutes a part of international law or not, since the principle had never been used at the [[International Court of Justice#Law applied|International Court of Justice]].

===Land dispute in the southwest===
[[File:Gulf of Piran sat borders.png|right|thumb|300 px|Border dispute in the [[Gulf of Piran]]. {{legend|blue|Main flow of Dragonja, according to Croatian side}} {{legend|cyan|Artificial canal of St. Odorick}} {{legend|yellow|Slovenia claimed border}}]]
Along with the sea dispute, the two countries also have a land border dispute in the Gulf area, along the Dragonja river. Like in other disputed parts of the border, the dispute stems from differing principles of demarcation: while the border between two republics was often drawn based on (sometimes loose) political agreements or along natural landforms, [[cadastral]] records from villages along the border continued to refer to the land which ended up controlled by the other republic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In the delta of Dragonja, Slovenia claims that the border is south of the river (thus including all the land that is registered in the cadastral municipality of [[Se<U+010D>ovlje]]), while Croatia claims that the border is on the river itself (St. Odoric canal). The Croatian side rejects Slovenian arguments for cadastral borders on just this part of the mutual border (where it goes in favor of Slovenia), saying that if the cadastral principle would be consistently implemented, Slovenia would lose much more territory elsewhere than it could receive in the [[Gulf of Piran]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Another source of conflict in this area has been the unilaterally established border crossing at [[Plovanija]]<ref name="Sedanja izhodi<U+0161><U+010D>a za dolo<U+010D>itev meje med Slovenijo in Hrva<U+0161>ko">{{cite web|url=http://www.25junij.si/publikacija/slo-hr_meja_v_istri.pdf|date=2004-09-01|title=Sedanja izhodi<U+0161>a za dolo<U+010D>itev dr<U+017E>avne meje med Slovenijo in Hrva<U+0161>ko|publisher=Zavod za varovanje narodne dedi<U+0161><U+010D>ine|language=Slovenian}}</ref> by Croatian side on the territory which has been claimed by both sides. Despite stating that the border crosspoint is only a temporary solution, Croatia has included this checkpoint as undisputable in its international documents. Consequently, the territories laying south of that border checkpoint with Slovenian population are considered to be under Croatia's occupation by many Slovenian politicians and legal experts.<ref name="Slovensko-hrva<U+0161>ka meja v Istri: Preteklost in sedanjost">{{cite web|url=http://www.25junij.si/publikacija/slo-hr_meja_v_istri.pdf|title=Slovensko-hrva<U+0161>ka meja v Istri: Preteklost in sedanjost|date=2004-09-01|publisher=Zavod za varovanje narodne dedi<U+0161><U+010D>ine|language=Slovenian}}</ref> Similarly, Croatia has included in this documents, presented in its process of negotiation for joining the EU, their proposal of the border, without clearly demarcating the disputable status of those parts of the borderline. This was perceived by the Slovenian side as an act of prejudicing the borderline. Therefore it resulted in Slovenia's blocking those Croatia's negotiation chapters for its membership in the EU which included the controversial documents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sta.si/vest.php?s=s&t=0&id=1347695|title=Jernej <U+0160>majdek: Slovenija v petek z blokado hrva<U+0161>kih pogajanj z EU |date=2001-12-17|publisher=STA|language=Slovenian}}</ref>

Both countries claim to have exercised most of the administrative jurisdiction over the contested area on the left bank of the river since 1954. The inhabitants in the strip have also been granted Slovenian citizenship in 1991. The Slovenian judiciary considers the area as integral part of Slovenia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.si/novice/slovenija/313341/|title=Piransko sodi<U+0161><U+010D>e je Jo<U+0161>ku Jorasu spet dovolilo odstranitev spornih cvetli<U+010D>nih korit|publisher=Dnevnik.si|language=Slovenian|date=2008-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/joras-lahko-odstrani-korita/86368|title=Joras lahko odstrani korita|publisher=RTV Slovenia|language=Slovenian|date=2008-04-17}}</ref> Among the Slovenian citizens residing in the area on the left bank of the Dragonja river is also the politician [[Jo<U+0161>ko Joras]], whose refusal to recognize any Croatian jurisdiction after independence of two countries has led to numerous conflicts between Slovenia and Croatia since the early 1990s. 

According to the Drnov<U+0161>ek-Ra<U+010D>an agreement, the border strip on the left bank of the Dragonja was recognized as part of Croatia.

According to some Croatian experts, the border between the countries should be a few miles north from the current flow of the river Dragonja, on what is regarded by them as the original flow of the river. The current river flow is actually a man-made canal, known as the Canal of St. Odoric. They point out that in 1944, in a meeting organized by the [[Yugoslav partisans|Partisan]] Scientific Institute, led by the Slovenian historian [[Fran Zwitter]], Slovenian and Croatian officials agreed on the river Dragonja as the border between the Socialist Republics of Croatia and Slovenia.<ref name=Vjesnik1>{{cite web|url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/2001/05/29/Clanak.asp?r=tem&c=2|title=Granica na Dragonji odre<U+0111>uje granicu na moru|date=2001-05-29|publisher=Vjesnik|language=Croatian}}</ref> However, the agreement was not officially established and neither the Slovenian nor the Croatian parliament have ever ratified it, neither was it ever internationally recognized. Even more, acoording to some Slovenian legal experts, e.g. Pavel Zupan<U+010D>i<U+010D>, the last internationally recognized border between the two countries was on the river Mirna to the south of the Dragonja.<ref name="Sedanja izhodi<U+0161><U+010D>a za dolo<U+010D>itev meje med Slovenijo in Hrva<U+0161>ko"/> However, the proposed border on Dragonja has also been referenced many times and even partially implemented{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. The Croatian argument is, accordingly, based exclusively on the Dragonja border proposal which Slovenia has never officially recognized. According to Croatian view, the current main flow of the Dragonja (Canal of St. Odoric) was man made; and, according to Dr. Ekl, international law does allow changes of river borders when they were made by nature, but not when they were man made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/2001/08/09/Clanak.asp?r=unu&c=13|title=Dr. Ekl: <U+00BB>Granica sa Slovenijom je prirodni tok rijeke Dragonje, a ne obodni kanal Sv. Odorika<U+00AB> |date=2001-08-29|publisher=Vjesnik|language=Croatian}}</ref> This, however, is not the official position of the Croatian government.

The Slovenian counterpart of the similar argument claims that the historically established municipality of Piran has historically also included the cadastral municipalities of Savudrija and Ka<U+0161>tel which constitute the northern part of Cape Savudrija.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25junij.si/index.php?module=strani&stranid=22&podstranID=9|title=Zgodovinska ob<U+010D>ina Piran obsega tudi katastrski ob<U+010D>ini Savudrija in Ka<U+0161>tel|date=2001-07-30|publisher=Zavod za varovanje narodne dedi<U+0161><U+010D>ine|language=Slovenian}}</ref> The division of the prewar municipality of Piran is therefore considered to be legally void, since any changes of borders should be, according to the former Yugoslav constitution, accepted by either the former federal parliament or by the parliaments of the former Yugoslav republics.<ref name="Bu<U+010D>ar za referendum o meji v Istri"/> Another support for the Slovenian claim of the Cape Savudrija comes from the ethnic structure of the area including Ka<U+0161>tel and Savudrija. In Ka<U+0161>tel, for instance, in 1880, 99.31% of the population was Slovenian-speaking. In 1910, the percent of Slovenian-speaking inhabitants fell to 29.08%, the rest of population being predominately Italian-speaking (65.22%), with only 5.70% Croatian-speaking population. Similarly, in Savudrija, in 1910, the percent of Slovenian-speaking population was 14.01, while the majority was Italian speaking (78.77%).<ref name="Slovenska narodna meja v Istri v 19.stoletju">{{cite web|url=http://www.25junij.si/publikacija/slo-hr_meja_v_istri.pdf|date=2004-09-01|title=Slovenska narodna meja v Istri v 19.stoletju|publisher=Zavod za varovanje narodne dedi<U+0161><U+010D>ine|language=Slovenian}}</ref> Slovenians were therefore the largest population in Ka<U+0161>tel and the largest non-Italian minority in Savudrija at the time. On that basis and since the two mentioned towns are claimed by Croatia, those experts claim that the border between the countries should be changed and established at the south border of the cadastral municipalities of Ka<U+0161>tel and Savudrija, at the middle of the Cape Savudrija. This position has been also supported by a few of notable Slovenian politicians, for example by [[Marjan Podobnik]] and his political and party-colleagues.<ref name="Slovensko-hrva<U+0161>ka meja v Istri: Preteklost in sedanjost"/>

Another Slovenian view in which change of international border was proposed by the first President of Slovenian Parliament and legal expert, France Bu<U+010D>ar.<ref name="Bu<U+010D>ar za referendum o meji v Istri">{{cite web|url=http://www.siol.net/slovenija/novice/2009/03/bucar_za_referendum_o_meji_v_istri.aspx|date=2009-03-01|title=Bu<U+010D>ar za referendum o meji v Istri|publisher=Siol|language=Slovenian}}</ref> He asserted that the present division of the Istrian peninsula, which was historically included in the Austrian part of Austro-Hungarian Empire (which also included the territory of modern Slovenia, but not the majority of modern Croatian territory, which was rather included in the Hungarian part), is legally unfounded and irrelevant. According to Bu<U+010D>ar, this division has never been based on proper legal acts and especially not on the will of Istria's autochthonous population. Therefore, Bu<U+010D>ar proposed that the border in Istria should be determined on the basis of referendum, which should be carried out for any territory which either of the countries proposed.<ref name="Bu<U+010D>ar za referendum o meji v Istri"/> This proposal is, according to Bu<U+010D>ar, based upon the legal principle of [[Self-determination]], the same principle on which the both countries' Declarations of Independence were based in 1991. Such process of border determination has been historically employed for the solution of the Slovenian-Austrian border, in the s.c. [[Carinthian Plebiscite]].

On 20 July 2001, the prime ministers of Slovenia and Croatia, [[Janez Drnov<U+0161>ek]] and [[Ivica Ra<U+010D>an]], made the so-called Drnov<U+0161>ek-Ra<U+010D>an agreement, which defined the entire border between the countries, including the maritime border.<ref>Damir Arnaut.

==EU accession blockade==

===Description of the blockade===
Slovenia's Prime Minister [[Borut Pahor]] stated at the time that documents <U+2013> notably maps <U+2013> which Croatia had provided as part of its candidacy for accession could prejudice a resolution of the two countries' long-running border dispute. This move was strongly criticized by Croatian officials.<ref name="euobserver">{{cite news|url=http://euobserver.com/9/27314|title=Slovenia to block Croatia EU accession talks|last=Vucheva|first=Elitsa|date=2008-12-18|work=Euobserver|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref><ref name="Europe">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7788646.stm|title=Slovenia blocks Croatian EU talks|last=|first=|date=2008-12-17|work=BBC|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref><ref name="Region">{{cite news|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region-article.php?yyyy=2008&mm=12&dd=03&nav_id=55481|title= Slovenia "blackmailing" Croatia|last=|first=|date=2008-12-03|work=B92|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>

A majority of other EU member states were in favor of continuing the accession talks. Six months before the blockade the Slovenian government reportedly asserted to Croatian authorities that it would continue the opening of new EU chapters if Croatia would annul its [[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]] (ZERP). Croatia officially did so on 15 March 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2008/03/11/nb-01|title=Croatian government gives up ZERP for sake of EU accession talks|publisher=SETimes.com|date=|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2008/03/13/feature-02|title=Croatia gives up ZERP|publisher=SETimes.com|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref> but in December 2008, Slovenia nonetheless began its opposition to Croatia's candidacy for [[EU]] membership.

Politicians from both states accused each other of trying to steal a part of their territory. Croatia suggested a border arbitration by a third party, while the Slovenian government suggested that the dispute be resolved through a special Croatian-Slovene commission.<ref name="Setimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/02/02/nb-03|title=Croatia again calls for international court arbitration to resolve border dispute with Slovenia|last=|first=|date=2007-02-02|work=Setimes|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref> The European Commission promised to mediate with a special commission.<ref>[http://euobserver.com/9/27737 "Croatia accepts EU mediation in border dispute with Slovenia"]</ref>

===EU blockade background===

[[Zmago Jelin<U+010D>i<U+010D>]], leader of the right wing [[Slovene National Party]] (SNS), has reportedly stated that Slovenia should block  Croatia's EU accession until the matter is resolved to his satisfaction. Former Slovenian foreign minister [[Dimitrij Rupel]] and minister of finance Franci stated in 2003 that they would stop supporting Croatian efforts to join the EU by 2007, together with [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]]. These two countries joined the EU while Croatia's negotiations were stalled due to the EU's accusations that it was unwilling to apprehend [[Ante Gotovina]] on its territory and deliver him to the Hague on war crimes charges (Gotovina was actually located and captured in Spain).<ref>Renwick McLean and Marlise Simons [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/world/europe/08iht-croatia.html?_r=1 Croatian war crimes suspect is arrested in Spain], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 December 2005. Accessdate 19 September 2010.</ref>

However, former Slovenian president [[Janez Drnov<U+0161>ek]] stated that Slovenia should act in the "European spirit" and carefully respond to any problems with Croatia.<ref name="Maritime Dispute">{{cite news|url=http://www.civilitasresearch.org/publications/view_article.cfm?article_id=50|title=Slovenia: Maritime dispute unlikely to obstruct Croatian EU membership ambitions|last=Radonjic|first=Biljana|date=2003-11-10|work=Civilitas Research|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

Before December 2008, Slovenia had, on numerous occasions, rejected the claim that it was responsible for blocking Croatia's EU accession, stating that ''"Zagreb is opening new chapters slowly because it has difficulties filling the standards of the organization it wants to join"''.<ref>[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1225728131.35 "Slovenia denies blocking Croatia's EU accession talks"]</ref>

===Blockade threats begin===
On 23 September 2004 Slovenia threatened to veto Croatia's EU accession after Croatian border police detained 12 Slovenes, among them leader of the opposition SLS [[Janez Podobnik]], after they refused to show their IDs at the [[Se<U+010D>ovlje]] crossing point. The activists stated they were visiting Joras who lives on the narrow strip of disputed land and claims it to be a part of Slovenia. After an emergency meeting, Slovenia's Prime Minister [[Anton Rop]] declared that Croatia was not fit to join the EU.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3684314.stm|title=Slovenia irked by Croatia arrests|last=|first=|date=2004-09-23|work=BBC|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csees.net/?page=country_analyses&country_id=7&ca_id=1359|title=RFE/RL Newsline: Slovenia threatens to block Croatian EU membership|last=|first=|date=2004-09-27|work=The Centre for SouthEast European Studies|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>

===Blockade of negotiations in December 2008===
[[File:Borut Pahor.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Slovenia's Prime Minister [[Borut Pahor]]]]
Although Slovenia sporadically slowed down the opening of new chapters between Croatia and the EU due to the border dispute, new prime minister [[Borut Pahor]] immediately announced the total blockade when he came to power when he accused Croatia of prejudging the border in its descriptions of its borders in the negotiation chapter with the EU. France, then the head of the EU presidency, moved on to prevent a possible blockade. On 21 November 2008, Pahor gave a speech declaring that the ''"last 14 days we have been in lively contact with the French presidency of the EU and are thankful for taking into consideration of our objections, so that the issue can be resolved on the adequate way"''.<ref name="dnevnik"/>

Pahor stated that Slovenia supports Croatia joining the EU, but that he expects understanding from the EU for Slovenia's reservations due to the unresolved border issue. The Croatian government responded that it just gave maps to the EU for the negation process, which simply show the border based on the 1991 borders of former Yugoslav republics. Pahor stated that he will ''"study the French suggestion for a compromise, but only under the condition that the documents which were prepared by Croatia for the accession negotiations don't prejudge the state border and that both the European Commission and the Council of EU understand that stance"''.<ref name="dnevnik">{{cite web|url=http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/slovenija-podrzava-brze-pristupne-pregovore-hrvatske-s-eu.html|title=Slovenija podr<U+017E>ava br<U+017E>e pristupne pregovore Hrvatske s EU|publisher=Dnevnik.hr|date=2008-11-21|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

A heavy blow to Croatia's EU accession was thus given by the following meeting of ministers of foreign affairs of the 27 EU countries in [[Brussels]] on 7 December 2008. The ministers didn't confirm the suggestion by the European Commission which demands that Croatia's EU accession negotiations end by 2009. The reason for that was Slovenia, which threatened with a veto if the border dispute with Croatia wasn't resolved. As a consequence, the ministers did not record the date of the conclusion of EU-Croatia negotiations. Croatia had initially hoped to join by 2010/11. "''Member states, understandingly, do not want another border row inside the EU''", stated Italian foreign minister [[Pasquale Ferrara]], concluding that one revolving around [[Cyprus]] is already enough. Following a discussion with EC, Pahor said that "Zagreb should accept the negotiation plan for the border dispute which was suggested by Slovenia to France". Pahor initially gave hints that Ljubljana is ready to find a solution in front of the negotiation table. ''"If Croatia does not open 10 chapters in December, it is obvious that it will not be able to close and conclude the negotiations by the end of 2009"'', said analyst [[<U+017D>eljko Trkanjec]].<ref>[http://www.worldbulletin.net/news_detail.php?id=33036 World Bulletin: Slovenia border row could set back Croatia's EU bid] World Bulletin</ref>

===Disputed documents===
Slovenian Minister of foreign affairs [[Samuel <U+017D>bogar]] revealed to Slovene public on 19 December the content of documents from 7 chapters in which Croatia is negotiating with the EU, and which are the main reason for the Slovenian blockade of negotiations. According to <U+017D>bogar, these are documents from chapters [[Agriculture]], Food safety, [[Veterinary]] & [[Phytosanitary Policy]], [[Taxation]], [[Infrastructure]], Regional politics and structural instruments, [[Justice]], [[Political freedom|Freedom]] and [[Security]] as well as [[Natural environment|Environment]].<ref name="zbogar"/>

*In the chapter on [[agriculture]], the disputed settlements on the left side of Dragonja river were stated as part of Croatia ([[<U+0160>krile]], [[Bu<U+017E>in]], [[<U+0160>kudelini]], [[Veli Mlin]]).
*In food safety, the disputable point is the mention of Croatian epicontinental area in the [[Adriatic sea]].
*In the chapter on [[taxation]], the border crossing [[Plovanija]] is explicitly stated, apropos temporary border point at Se<U+010D>ovlje, for which in 1994 the prime minister [[Nikica Valenti<U+0107>]] explicitly and in written stated that it does not prejudge the border.
*In [[infrastructure]], maps were enclosed which show the drawn sea border.
*In the area of regional policymaking, the stumbling point is the intervention plan in case of a sea pollution, which mentions [[ZERP]], and maps were enclosed which show the drawn sea border.
*In the chapter on justice, maps were enclosed which show the border crossings, mentioning Plovanija and cadastre parcels from the [[cadastre]] which was created after 25 June 1991.
*In the chapter on the [[Natural environment|Environment]], ZERP is mentioned and maps were enclosed which show the sea border.

Minister <U+017D>bogar told the reporters that Slovenia must "protect its national interests" and that "Slovenia does not enjoy this position". He added that in case of an arbitration Slovenia will not use documents which were created after 25 June 1991 and the Conference at [[Brijuni]]<ref name="zbogar">{{cite journal|url=http://www.seebiz.eu/hr/politika/zbogar-pojasnio-sto-tocno-sloveniju-smeta,33123.html|title=Sporni dokumenti: <U+017D>bogar pojasnio <U+0161>to to<U+010D>no Sloveniju smeta|date=2008-12-19|journal=|page=|issue=|publisher=Seebiz.eu|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

On 23 June 2009, Slovenia blocked the closing of another chapter in Croatia's EU accession negotiations, [[Statistics]], leaving Zagreb with a total of 13 blocked chapters. The explanation was that the statistics chapter contains maps sent to Brussels as part of Croatia's accession documents, with the country's borders pre-drawn against Slovenia's wishes.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/main/news/20472|title=Slovenia Blocks Croatia's EU Progress|date=2009-06-24|journal=|page=|issue=|publisher=[[Balkan Insight]]|accessdate=2009-07-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://kurier.at/nachrichten/1918013.php|title=EU-Beitritt: Kroatien in der Warteschleife|date=2009-06-28|journal=|page=|issue=|publisher=Kurier.at|accessdate=2009-07-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

On 24 July 2009, Slovenia officially blocked the closing of the policy chapter [[Freedom of Movement]] for Workers in Croatia's EU accession talks, standardly explaining that in that chapter, too, Croatia had submitted documents "prejudging the Croatian-Slovene border". This raises the number of chapters the opening or closing of which has been blocked to 14. Slovenia was the only member-country that withheld its consent for the closing of the chapter Freedom of Movement for Workers. Slovene officials said the reason for such a decision was that in its documents submitted to the European Commission Croatia was referring to the Act on the Office of Notary Public, which in turn was referring to the Act on Towns and Municipalities and its list of towns and municipalities in Croatia, including four border villages in [[Istria]] which Slovenia disputes.<ref>Stojan DePrato [http://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/anketa-clanak-5453 Slovenija blokirala i 14. poglavlje: Slobodu kretanja radnika] [[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]. 24 July 2009.

A source in the Swedish EU Presidency said that despite the blockade, Croatia was continuing with the reforms within the accession process, a fact that was taken note of at the meeting of the enlargement task force.<ref>[http://www.emportal.rs/en/news/region/94968.html Slovenia blocks one more EU policy chapter] Emportal.rs</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://derstandard.at/fs/1246543006630/Slowenien-blockiert-weiteres-Kapitel-bei-Verhandlungen|title=Slowenien blockiert weiteres Kapitel bei Verhandlungen|last= |first= |date=2009-07-25|work=Der Standard|accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref>

The French proffered a simple document which would finish the dispute, namely a signed declaration on both sides that neither is prejudging the border. The Chairman of the Board of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) of the Council of EU ministers of foreign affairs (GAERC), which discussed for 3 days about the Slovene amendments on the French proposal for de-blockade of the negotiation process, French ambassador at the EU, [[Pierre Sellal]], stated that he is "in touch with the Slovene colleague in order to find a fair solution". All 26 member states were for the French proposal, while none were for the Slovene amendments.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/france-fails-unblock-croatia-turkey-eu-talks/article-178195|title=France fails to unblock Croatia, Turkey's EU talks|last=|first=|date=2008-12-18|work=Euractiv|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

''"One needs to understand that the negotiations of Croatia's EU accession cannot have the goal to resolve bilateral issues between Croatia and Slovenia.

A couple of anonymus groups on Croatian websites urged the Croatian public to boycott all Slovene products, even though Sanader urged the people not do so.<ref>{{cite web|author=news networld Internetservice GmbH|url=http://www.news.at/articles/0851/15/228878/aufregung-eu-veto-kroatien-waren-slowenien|title=Aufregung nach angek<U+00FC>ndigtem EU-Veto: Kroatien boykottiert Waren aus Slowenien|publisher=News.at|date=2008-12-18|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

[[Bernd Posselt]], the German representative at the European parliament condemned on Thursday 18 December 2008 the Slovenian government's act of blockade, calling it "Anti-European aggression". Posselt, a representative of Bavarian [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] Party in the European parliament, also called it an act of "ransom": "''The Slovene socialist government is abusing its right for a veto. Because of a marginal bilateral dispute, Slovenia is blackmailing the middle European candidate country Croatia, excellently prepared for a EU accession, even though the deeply pro-European Croatian government expressed its readiness to let all the unresolved problems get resolved at the international arbitration a long time ago''", he said. He also added he feels "disappointed and double-crossed by Borut Pahor's administration, who previously promised a balanced and constructive relationship with Zagreb".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daily.tportal.hr/index.aspx?aID=4599&kID=1|title=EPP rappourteur: 'Anti-European aggression'|publisher=Daily.tportal.hr|date=|accessdate=2010-06-11}}</ref>

The [[European Commission]] expressed its regret due to Slovenia's decision to block Croatia. ''"The commission has consistently maintained the view that the border issue is a bilateral issue that should not be brought to the table of the accession negotiations"'', said [[Crisztina Nagy]], a commission spokeswoman<ref>{{cite news|url= http://english.sina.com/world/2008/1218/205782.html|title=European Commission regrets Slovenia's threat to block EU-Croatia accession negotiations|last=|first=|date=2008-12-12|work=Sina|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

===Ljubljana's threat of additional blockade of Croatia's NATO accession===
{{Main|Accession of Croatia to NATO}}
[[File:Location NATO 2009.svg|thumb|400px|{{legend|#ff6600|Albania and Croatia joined NATO in 2009.}}]]
In January 2009, some Slovenian politicians started threatening that they would also block Croatia's accession into [[NATO]]. Slovene Prime Minister Borut Pahor stated his regret on 29 January due to the move by the opposition [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] (SDS) which threatened to boycott the assembly which was supposed to decide about the ratification of accession protocols into NATO of the future member states Croatia and [[Albania]], which resulted in the fact that the assembly had to be postponed. Still, in the end, the Slovenian parliament ratified Croatia's NATO accession.<ref>[http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=232508 Slovenia Ratifies Croatia's Accession in NATO] Javno.hr</ref> Unforeseen complications occurred when the small, outer parliament [[Party of Slovenian Nation]] (SSN) and "Zavod 25. junij", headed by Marjan Podobnik from the SLS Party, gathered 2,500 signatures which, according to the Constitution, gives it time until March to gather additional 40,000 signatures for a referendum of Croatia joining NATO".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3672931,00.html|title=Slovenia groups try to block Croatia NATO membership|last=|first=|date=2009-02-16|work=Ynet news|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> NATO then expressed its concern due to such complications.<ref>[http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?id=1364698 NATO "Concerned about Ratification of Croatia's Membership in Slovenia"] Sta.si</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/18/content_10837090.htm|title=NATO urges Slovenia not to block Croatia's accession to alliance|last=Deng|first=Shasha|date=2009-02-18|work=China view|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> Controversy erupted over claims that Slovene [[Andrej <U+0160>i<U+0161>ko]], a man convicted of 22 months in prison for an attempted murder and a member of the SSN, took a day off in prison in Rogoza to attend the negotiations of the highest body of his Party with Pahor about preventing a referendum.<ref>[http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/svijet/10577/Robijas-nam-blokira-put-u-NATO.html "Robija<U+0161> nam blokira put u NATO"] tportal.hr</ref><ref>[http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?id=1364582 Dnevnik Blames Pahor and Jansa for NATO Snag] Sta.si</ref> 

The ''[[Ve<U+010D>ernji list]]'' columnist [[Milan Jaj<U+010D>inovi<U+0107>]] sharply criticized this outcome in his column: "''Slovenia's Prime Minister Borut Pahor, it seems, got scared of the created madness he himself contributed to. And he is not the only Slovenian politician whose (ill) considered statements participated in creating intolerance towards Croatia<U+2026>Problems with Croatia have already for years been exaggerated or even made up, and then such constructions are used to madden the masses... The tactic is always the same: at first a politician finds a grouch against Croatia, then the media publish it, the public gets upset and agitated, hysteria breaks out, and then those same politicians show up again, because "the public opinion demands it"''".<ref>''Ve<U+010D>ernji list'', 21 February 2009, p. 15</ref>

Still, the referendum attempt wasn't successful since not even 2,000 signatures were gathered, opening the way for Croatia to become a full NATO member in April 2009. That again prompted discussions about Pahor's discrepancy, since Croatia is supposedly not good enough for the EU, but fine for NATO membership.<ref>[http://www.teameurope.info/node/468 Constitutional debacle in Slovenia over Croatian NATO membership] Teameurope.info</ref>

===EU's proposal for a mediation in the border dispute===
On 22 January 2009, the European Commission announced that it is ready to create a mediation council made out of three members which is supposed to mediate in the border row. According to reports, [[Finland]]'s winner of the [[Nobel prize]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] and French expert for law [[Robert Badinter]] were supposed to join the council. The report came out just a day after [[Olli Rehn]] visited politicians of Ljubljana and Zagreb.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/1232653621.62|title=EU moots special body to solve Slovenia, Croatia border row: report|last=|first=|date=2009-02-22|work=Eubusiness|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

At first, Ivo Sanader rejected a meeting with Pahor without participation of the members of the European Commission,<ref>[http://www.ukom.gov.si/eng/slovenia/publications/slovenia-news/8073/8123/ ''"Croatian Daily'': Sanader Rejects Bilateral Meeting with Pahor"]</ref> but he then still decided for a compromise and agreed. After numerous complications around the location and time of the meeting, the meeting was held on 24 February in [[Macelj]],<ref>[http://www.kpv.gov.si/nc/en/splosno/cns/news/article/1914/3586/ "Croatia meeting is a step forward, says Prime Minister Borut Pahor"]</ref> but no significant accomplishment was achieved. Subsequently, the Slovenian government blocked another additional negotiation chapter, totaling 13 blocked chapters in Croatia's talks with the EU.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.javno.com/en/minute-by-minute/article.php?id=1572206|title=Slovenia Blocks Another Croatian Chapter|last=|first=|date=2009-02-22|work=Javno.hr|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://euobserver.com/15/28366|title=EU officials tire of Croatia-Slovenia dispute|last=Vucheva|first=Elitsa|date=2009-06-24|work=EUobserver|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> A second meeting was planned on 28 April in Croatia, but it was canceled by the Slovenian side.<ref>[http://www.javno.com/en-croatia/slovenes-cancel-sanader-pahor-meeting_253115 "Slovenes Cancel Sanader-Pahor Meeting"] Javno.com</ref>

On 17 April, President Mesi<U+0107> again stated that he is puzzled by Pahor's move to block the accession talks instead of resolving the issue at the International Court of Justice: "''I don't understand, why is Slovenia so afraid of [[International Law]]? That's the only [[Riddle|enigma]] I can't comprehend''".<ref>[http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/2009/04/17/Clanak.asp?r=unu&c=2 Mesi<U+0107>: Ne razumijem tko se boji me<U+0111>unarodnog prava] Vjesnik.hr</ref>

In June 2009, Croatia accepted Rehn's proposal for an arbitration commission, but Slovenia rejected it and proposed four new, changed amendments. Out of four amendments proposed by Slovenia, Rehn accepted just one, for the three 'ad hoc' arbitrage judges to be selected by the two parties in dispute from the proposed list instead of the president of the ICJ. However, Croatia refused this amendment after reviewing the list, including mainly 'legal experts' and not renowned judges, and decided for the original proposal, which Ljubljana rejected. At the same time, the Slovenian delegation also opposed this as it failed to guarantee a successful outcome. Sanader proposed that the two parliaments ratify a statement stating that none of the documents presuppose the interstate border, and should Slovenia not accept this, that legal experts at the European Commission should examine the documents to determine whether it is true. In case Ljubljana should reject both proposals, ''"it is up to the EU to decided how the accession talks with Croatia should end and whether the article 7 of the EU contract should be activated"'', which implies a revokement of voting right for a member country which is persistently violating EU principles. Sanader added that Pahor ''"should ask [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]] for some sea''".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seebiz.eu/en/politics/sanader-enough,-pahor-should-ask-berlusconi-for-sea!,48641.html|title=Sanader: Enough, Pahor should ask Berlusconi for sea!|last= |first= |date=2009-06-18|work=SEEbiz.eu|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref>

===Resignation of Ivo Sanader===
On 1 July 2009, Croatia's prime minister Ivo Sanader unexpectedly announced his resignation. He held a brief news conference before announcing his decision. [[Jadranka Kosor]] succeeded him.<ref>[http://www.euronews.net/2009/07/01/croatian-prime-minister-ivo-sanader-resigns "Croatian prime minister Ivo Sanader resigns"]</ref>

===Kosor-Pahor meetings and the end of the blockade===
[[File:Jadranka Kosor 2009-06-25.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Jadranka Kosor]], Croatia's Prime Minister since 2009]]
On 31 July 2009, the second meeting between the Croatian-Slovenian governments was held, this time in Croatia, in the castle in[[Trako<U+0161><U+0107>an]]. The meeting between the newly appointed Croatian Prime Minister [[Jadranka Kosor]] and her Slovenian counterpart Borut Pahor was reportedly constructive and passed in mutual respect. ''"We have found the road to take<U+2026>I am very satisfied we started to agree on issues in the interest of both countries"'', Kosor stated. Pahor argued that there is a big chance that already this year a solution will be found for the problem of both countries, that is EU access for Croatia and a solution for the border dispute. The agreement will be found on the basis of good neighbouring relations according to both leaders. One of the solutions could be a [[condominium]] - an area in which sovereignty is shared and may involve the establishment of joint governance structures - over the Savudrija Cove, also known as Piran Bay.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.europeanforum.net/news/699/agreement_on_the_slovenia_croatia_border_issue_by_the_end_of_the_year|title=Agreement on the Slovenia-Croatia border issue by the end of the year|first=|date=2009-08-04|work=European Forum|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090731-croatia-slovenia-optimistic-resolving-border-row|title=Croatia, Slovenia optimistic of resolving border row|last=|first=|date=2009-07-31|work=[[France24]]|accessdate=2009-08-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=f&id=1414744|title=Slovenian, Croatian PMs Optimistic After First Meeting|last=|first=|date=2009-07-31|work=STA|accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>

On 11 September 2009, Kosor and Pahor met again, this time in [[Ljubljana]], and agreed on the final details of agreement to end the blockade. After Kosor sent the letter from Ljubljana to the [[EU presidency]] announcing Croatia does not wish to prejudge the border in any way and that negotiations about the border dispute will take place under EU supervision, Pahor said that Slovenia's blockade will soon be lifted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jutarnji.hr/vijesti/clanak/art-2009,9,11,,175956.jl|title=Premijeri Kosor i Pahor postigli dogovor o deblokadi|last=|first=|date=2009-09-11|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref>

Pahor said the government would immediately propose to parliament that "Slovenia removes restraints for Croatia's EU negotiating process". For her part, Croatia's prime minister said she had faxed a letter to the [[Sweden|Swedish]] EU presidency saying they had "reached an agreement on the continuation of talks with the EU and continuation of the border talks... No document can be prejudicial to the final border solution", she added. Pahor claimed it was a "victory for both countries".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8250441.stm|title=Slovenia unblocks Croatian EU bid|last=|first=|date=2009-09-11|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/slovenia-croatia.et|title=Slovenia ready to end Veto on Croatia's EU bid|last=|first=|date=2009-09-11|work=Eubusiness|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref>

''[[Delo]]'' editorialized that this Slovenian/Croatian agreement was a "return to common sense".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&id=1426253|title=Delo Says Slovenia and Croatia Returning to Common Sense|last=|first=|date=2009-09-12|work=STA|accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref> The [[Slovene People's Party]] (SLS) announced that it would start collecting signatures of support for a referendum on the arbitration agreement between Slovenia and Croatia that is to determine the manner in which the final border between the two countries is to be set down.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sta.si/en/vest.php?s=a&id=1428066|title=SLS Announces Croatia Referendum Support Probe|last=|first=|date=2009-09-12|work=STA|accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref>

Kosor and Pahor met again on 26 October 2009, in Zagreb and worked out final proposal of Arbitration Agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2009/listopad/predsjednica_vlade_s_predsjednikom_vlade_republike_slovenije_borutom_pahorom|title=Premiers Kosor, Pahor say two countries at watershed, politics must find solutions|last=|first=|date=2009-10-26|work=Government of Croatia|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> Croatian Parliament gave its assent to Kosor for signing the Arbitration Agreement with Slovenia on November 2, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2009/studeni/sabor_prihvatio_sporazum_o_arbitrazi|title=Croatian parliament approves arbitration deal with Slovenia |last=|first=|date=2009-11-02|work=Government of Croatia|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref>

The Arbitration Agreement between [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]] was signed in [[Stockholm]] on 4 November 2009, by both countries' prime ministers, [[Jadranka Kosor]] and [[Borut Pahor]], and the President of the EU, [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2009/studeni/predsjednica_vlade_rh_kosor_i_predsjednik_slovenske_vlade_pahor_otvorena_nova_stranica_u_odnosima_dviju_zemalja|title=Croatia, Slovenia open new chapter in their relations, PMs say|last=|first=|date=2009-11-04|work=Government of Croatia|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref>

Despite the de-escalation after the agreement, Slovenian government avoided to lift the blockade of the three last chapters <U+2013> on the [[Natural environment|environment]], on fisheries, and on foreign, security and [[defence policy]]. [[Samuel <U+017D>bogar]], Slovenia's foreign minister, declared in December 2009 that his government had <U+201C>reservations<U+201D> about the substance of the three chapters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/slovenia-finds-new-ways-to-block-croatia's-eu-bid/66719.aspx |title=Slovenia finds new ways to block Croatia's EU bid|last=Vogel|first=Toby|date=2009-12-17|work=EU voice|accessdate=2010-03-28}}</ref> However, a [[Slovenian border dispute agreement referendum, 2010|referendum]] was held in Slovenia on 6 June 2010 on approving an agreement to bring the border dispute with Croatia before an international arbitration tribunal.
