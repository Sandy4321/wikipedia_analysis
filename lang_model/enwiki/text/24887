'''Pavle <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: <U+041F><U+0430><U+0432><U+043B><U+0435> <U+0402><U+0443><U+0440><U+0438><U+0448><U+0438><U+045B>; July 9, 1907 <U+2013> April 12, 1945) was a [[Montenegrin Serb]] [[Chetnik]] commander. He led a significant proportion of the [[Chetniks]] of [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941<U+2013>1944)|Montenegro]] during World War II. Beginning in early 1942, he increasingly [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated]] with the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italians]] in actions against the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. In 1943, he carried out several massacres against the Muslim population of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Sand<U+017E>ak]] and participated in the [[Axis powers|Axis]]' [[Fourth Enemy Offensive]] alongside Italian troops. He was captured by the Germans in May 1943, then escaped and was re-captured. After the capitulation of Italy, he was released by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] and began to collaborate with them and the [[Nedi<U+0107>'s Serbia|Serbian quisling state]]. In 1944, he created the [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]] with assistance from the Germans, [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]], and [[Dimitrije Ljoti<U+0107>]]. In late 1944 he was decorated with the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class by the German commander in Montenegro. He was killed by elements of the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) near Banja Luka after he was captured in an apparent trap set by them and [[Sekula Drljevi<U+0107>]].

==World War II==

[[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Fascist Italy]] invaded Montenegro in April 1941, the Germans from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the Italians from [[Albania]]. The Germans withdrew and left the Italians to occupy the area. Almost immediately the Montenegrins developed grievances against the Italians, particularly regarding the expulsion of Montenegrin people from the [[Kosovo]] region and [[Vojvodina]], but also due to loss of territory and revenue.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 138-139</ref> In mid-July 1941, there was a general uprising against the Italians, led by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|communists]] but including large numbers of [[Nationalism|nationalists]] and former [[Royal Yugoslav Army|Yugoslav Army]] officers, some of whom had been recently released from [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s. The rebels seized control of small towns and villages early on, but the Italians regained control over all towns and communication routes within six weeks. In the aftermath of the Italian repression, a split developed between the communist leaders of the uprising and the nationalists that had participated.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 140-142</ref> As a result, the nationalists, including then Captain <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, who was popular in his own Vasojevi<U+0107> clan of northern Montenegro, withdrew into the hinterland.<ref name="Pavlowitch78">[[#Pavlowitch_2007|Pavlowitch (2007)]], p.78</ref> The focus of the nationalists such as <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was to avoid provoking the Italians but protect the mountain villages if they were attacked.<ref>[[#Karchmar_1987|Karchmar (1987)]], p. 386</ref> <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and his local Chetniks were also impatient to turn on the Muslims and Albanians in the region.<ref name="Pavlowitch78"/>   

===Italian Occupation of Montenegro 1941-1943===
In October 1941, Captain <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was appointed as commander of all regular and reserve troops in central and eastern Montenegro and parts of the [[Sand<U+017E>ak]] by [[Dra<U+017E>a Mihailovi<U+0107>]].<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p. 46</ref>

In early January 1942, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> returned from a trek to Serbia with detailed instructions bearing the signature of Mihailovi<U+0107>. These instructions included directives for 'cleansing the Muslim population from Sand<U+017E>ak and the Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina' amongst other orders.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp.170</ref> Some historians argue that there is a convincing case that the document was a forgery made by Djuri<U+0161>i<U+0107> after he failed to reach Mihailovi<U+0107> in December 1941 because Mihailovi<U+0107> had been driven out of Ravna Gora by [[Operation Mihailovi<U+0107>]].<ref>[[#Karchmar_1987|Karchmar (1987)]], p.397</ref><ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2007|Pavlowitch (2007)]], pp.79-80</ref><ref>[[#Malcolm_1994|Malcolm (1994)]], p.179</ref> However, other historians consider the document to be authentic and attribute the instructions to Mihailovi<U+0107>.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p.64</ref><ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp.256-261</ref>

Despite his possession of these instructions, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> initially had very little influence on the non-communist elements of the Montenegrin resistance and was unable to develop an effective strategy against the Italians or Partisans in the first few months after his return to Montenegro. However, during the first few months of 1942, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s [[Chetniks|Chetnik detachment]] became more active, especially in eastern Montenegro and the Sand<U+017E>ak against local Muslims.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p.47</ref> Following the Partisan occupation of [[Kola<U+0161>in]] in January and February 1942, during which the Partisans committed atrocities against the population of the town, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> recaptured it and held it as a Chetnik stronghold until May 1943.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2007|Pavlowitch (2007)]], pp. 105-106</ref>
[[File:Pavle <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and Pirzio Biroli speech.jpg|thumb|260px|<U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> making a speech to the Chetniks in the presence of General [[Alessandro Pirzio Biroli|Pirzio Biroli]], Italian governor of [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941<U+2013>1944)|Montenegro]].]]
In early March 1942, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> arranged one of the first collaboration agreements between the Italians and the Chetniks. During the next three months, about 1,500 Chetniks under <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s command were officially organised and recognised as Italian auxiliary troops for use against the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]], and were supplied, armed and paid by the Italians. During the rest of 1942, Italian operations in conjunction with their Chetnik auxiliaries forced the remaining Partisans out of Montenegro,<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2007|Pavlowitch (2007)]], p. 106</ref> after which the Chetnik auxiliaries were used by the Italians to police the countryside.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], pp. 142-143</ref> For most of this time, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> operated fairly independently in northern Montenegro and was described as 'a law unto himself'.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2007|Pavlowitch (2007)]], p. 109</ref>

In June 1942, just as the Italians and Chetniks were pushing the Partisans out of Montenegro, Mihailovi<U+0107> arrived there having been forced out of Serbia by the Germans. Mihailovi<U+0107> was accompanied by his staff and a British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) liaison officer, and after moving around for a while he established his base at the village of Gornje Lipovo, a few miles from <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s headquarters at Kola<U+0161>in. Mihailovi<U+0107> and his staff had few troops and relied on <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> for protection. Not long after Mihailovi<U+0107> arrived in Montenegro, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> told Mihailovi<U+0107>'s SOE liaison officer that he was available to act independently and in defiance of Mihailovi<U+0107>. While <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and the other Chetnik commanders in Montenegro nominally recognised Mihailovi<U+0107> as their supreme commander, they rarely obeyed him.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2007|Pavlowitch (2007)]], pp. 109-113</ref>

In December 1942 at the village of <U+0160>ahovi<U+0107>i near [[Bijelo Polje]], a conference of Chetniks from Montenegro and Sand<U+017E>ak met. The conference was dominated by <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, as well as an agenda which focussed on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch_2007|Pavlowitch (2007)]], p. 112</ref>

===Operation Weiss and 'Cleansing Actions'===
In December 1942, concerned about the possibility of an Allied landing in the Balkans, the Germans began planning the [[Fourth Enemy Offensive]] codenamed "Operation Weiss", in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The size of the planned offensive required the involvement of both the [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia]] and the Italians. Late in the planning, the Italians began to prepare and equip Chetnik detachments, including that of <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, for involvement in the operation.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp. 113-116</ref>

In early January 1943, the Chetnik Supreme Command ordered Montenegrin Chetnik units to carry out "cleansing actions" against Muslims in the [[Bijelo Polje]] county in the Sand<U+017E>ak region of north-eastern Montenegro. On 10 January 1943, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> reported that Chetniks under his command had burned down 33 Muslim villages, killed 400 members of the Muslim self-protection militia supported by the Italians, and had also killed about 1,000 Muslim women and children.<ref name="Tomasevich258-259">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 258-259</ref>

As Italian auxiliaries, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s detachment was so dependent on the Italians for arms and transport that it had not left Montenegro on 18 January 1943, only two days before the first phase of Operation Weiss was to begin.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp.115-116</ref>
[[File:Pavle <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> 13 February 1943 Muslim massacre report.jpg|thumb|right|<U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s report of 13 February 1943 informing Mihailovi<U+0107> of the massacres of Muslims in the counties of [[<U+010C>ajni<U+010D>e]] and [[Fo<U+010D>a]] in southeastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and in the county of [[Pljevlja]] in the Sand<U+017E>ak.]]
In mid-February, during their advance north-west into Herzegovina in preparation for their involvement in the Fourth Enemy Offensive, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s detachment received further orders for 'cleansing actions' against Muslims, and committed further atrocities against the Muslim population, this time in part of the [[Pljevlja]] county in Sand<U+017E>ak, and [[<U+010C>ajni<U+010D>e]] county and part of the [[Fo<U+010D>a]] county in Bosnia. In a report to Mihailovi<U+0107> dated 13 February 1943, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> reported that his forces had killed about 1,200 Muslim fighters and about 8,000 old people, women, and children, and destroyed all property except for livestock, grain and hay, which they seized.<ref name="Tomasevich258-259"/>

The total number of deaths caused by the anti-Muslim operations commanded by <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> between January and February 1943 is estimated at 10,000. The casualty rate would have been higher had a great number of Muslims not already fled the area, most to [[Sarajevo]], when the February action began.<ref name="Tomasevich258-259"/>

By the end of February 1943, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s Chetniks were resisting Partisan attempts to move east from the Neretva.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp.124-125</ref><ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p.239</ref> After the Battle of Neretva, during which the Partisans forced a crossing of the Neretva River against faltering Chetnik opposition, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s detachment, numbering about 2,000 fighters, fell back to [[Kalinovik]] where they were badly mauled by the Partisan Second Proletarian Division in late March. Falling back further towards the [[Drina]] River, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> had assembled about 4,500 Bosnian and Montenegrin Chetniks around Fo<U+010D>a by the end of the first week in April, but was in desperate need of supplies. Shortly after this, the Italians withdrew most of their troops from Fo<U+010D>a and abandoned most of the Sand<U+017E>ak. For the rest of April 1943, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> fought a holding action against the Partisans along the Drina River with his 3,000 remaining fighters.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], pp.135-136</ref>

===Capture and Release===
The Germans determined to follow-up Operation Weiss with a [[Fifth Enemy Offensive]] codenamed "Operation Schwarz". In early May 1943, the Germans entered the Sand<U+017E>ak and eastern Montenegro. <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> withdrew to [[Kola<U+0161>in]] with about 500 fighters and joined forces with Serbian Chetniks commanded by Dragutin Keserovi<U+0107>.<ref>[[#Milazzo_1975|Milazzo (1975)]], p.144</ref> On 14 May 1943, a forward detachment of the [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|German 1st Mountain Division]] entered Kola<U+0161>in. <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and the Chetniks did not resist their capture, and there were no casualties. The Italians vigorously protested his capture but were overruled by the Germans.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 252-253</ref>  <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was sent to a [[prisoner of war camp]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] from which he escaped, reportedly in August 1943, and after some time reached Serbia.<ref name="Tomasevich 1975 pp. 349-351">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 349-351</ref>

He was caught by the [[Nedi<U+0107>'s Serbia|Serbian quisling government]] and handed over to the German occupation authorities.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 349-350</ref> Soon after, the German Special Envoy in Belgrade [[Hermann Neubacher]], [[Nedi<U+0107>]] and the German Military Commander in South-East Europe [[Hans Felber|General Hans Felber]] arranged for <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> to be released from prison.<ref name=Ramet>[[#Ramet_2006|Ramet (2006)]], pp. 134-135</ref> In November 1943, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> returned to Montenegro where he received supplies including arms and ammunition from the Germans with which to fight the [[Yugoslav Partisans]].<ref name=Ramet/> At this time <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> established closer ties with [[Dimitrije Ljoti<U+0107>]], whose [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]] provided him with weapons, food, typewriters, and other supplies, and with [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]] who promoted <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and appointed him assistant to the commander of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, Colonel [[Kosta Mu<U+0161>icki]].<ref name=Cohen>[[#Cohen_1996|Cohen (1996)]], p. 45</ref>

===German Occupation of Montenegro 1943-1944===
In spring of 1944, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, with assistance from the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]], [[Milan Nedi<U+0107>]], and [[Dimitrije Ljoti<U+0107>]], established the [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]]. It was formally a part of the [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]].<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 441</ref> The Corps consisted of some of <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s former troopers that were released from German captivity, but the majority were Chetniks that remained in Montenegro under the name of "national forces". By this time, whilst he still formally owed allegiance to Yugoslavia,<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 351</ref> he also owed some allegiance to the Germans and Nedi<U+0107> <ref>[[#Tomasevich_2001|Tomasevich (2001)]], p. 222</ref> who released, promoted and supported him. <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> developed the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps in [[Kingdom of Montenegro (1941<U+2013>1944)|Montenegro]] and [[Sand<U+017E>ak]] and it consisted of between 7,000 and 8,000 men.<ref>[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], p. 350</ref> Lieutenant Heusz, former German liaison officer for Sand<U+017E>ak Chetnik commander [[Vojislav Luka<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]], was assigned to watch <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>. On May 30, 1944, Heusz sent a detailed briefing with instructions that <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was responsible "for control and assuring of the execution of the directives issued by the German command posts" and "liaison between the staffs and units of the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps on the one hand and the German command posts on the other, especially in the course of operations against the bands [the Partisans]." Collaboration between the forces of <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and the Germans continued through the summer and on into autumn.<ref name="Tomasevich 1975 pp. 349-351"/>

On October 11, 1944 the German Plenipotentiary General in Montenegro, General-Major Wilhem Keiper awarded <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> the [[Iron Cross]] (2nd Class) in the name of the [[F<U+00FC>hrer]] and the German High Command.<ref name=Cohen/>

===Withdrawal from Montenegro and Destruction===
In early December 1944, the Germans and <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s forces were obligated to withdraw from Montenegro, part of the way together, with the Germans going to [[Austria]] and <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s forces to northeastern Bosnia to join Mihailovi<U+0107>.<ref name="Tomasevich 1975 pp. 349-351"/> From the time he joined Mihailovi<U+0107> in northeastern Bosnia, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was very critical of Mihailovi<U+0107>'s leadership, and argued strongly for all the remaining Chetnik troops to move to Slovenia. When Mihailovi<U+0107> remained unconvinced, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> decided to move to Slovenia independent of Mihailovi<U+0107>, and arranged for [[Dimitrije Ljoti<U+0107>|Ljotic]]'s forces already in Slovenia to meet him near [[Biha<U+0107>]] in western Bosnia to assist his movement. When he left Mihailovi<U+0107>, he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragi<U+0161>a Vasi<U+0107> and the detachments commanded by [[Zaharije Ostoji<U+0107>]] and [[Petar Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107>]] as well as a large number of refugees.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 447-448</ref>

In order to get to Biha<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> made a safe-conduct agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the NDH and with the Montenegrin separatist [[Sekula Drljevi<U+0107>]]. The details of the agreement are not known, but it appears <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and his troops were meant to cross the [[Sava River]] into [[Slavonia]] where they would be aligned with Drljevi<U+0107> as the "Montenegrin National Army" with <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> retaining operational command.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448">[[#Tomasevich_1975|Tomasevich (1975)]], pp. 446-448</ref> <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, however, appears to have tried to outsmart the NDH forces and Drljevi<U+0107> by sending his sick and wounded across the river, but retained his fit troops south of the river, after which he began moving them westwards. Harassed by both the NDH troops and Partisans, he reached the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] River, which they began to cross. In the [[Battle of Lijev<U+010D>e polje]] north of [[Banja Luka]] the combined Chetnik force was badly beaten by a strong NDH force which included German-supplied tanks.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/>

Following this defeat and the defection of one of his sub-units to Drljevi<U+0107>, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. However, this appears to have been a trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. Following this, <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>, Vasi<U+0107>, Ostoji<U+0107> and Ba<U+0107>ovi<U+0107> were killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/>

Both the NDH forces and Drljevi<U+0107> had reasons for ensnaring <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>. The NDH forces because of the mass terror committed on the Muslim population in Sand<U+017E>ak and southeastern Bosnia and Drljevi<U+0107> because <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> was in support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which was in opposition to Drljevi<U+0107>'s separatism.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/>

===Aftermath===
A small part of <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107>'s troops escaped and went west; however a larger part of them, left without a leader, were integrated into Drljevi<U+0107>'s forces and were dispatched towards the Austrian border.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/> A portion of both groups were later caught by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in Slovenia.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/> The majority of those who successfully crossed into [[Austria]] were returned by the Partisans to Slovenia, where, alongside other collaborationist forces, they met their downfall in May. Of the entire force that began with <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> in Montenegro and other Chetniks that joined him for the trek less than a fourth survived. A few weeks later, Drljevi<U+0107>, who had fled to Austria, was discovered by followers of <U+0110>uri<U+0161>i<U+0107> and killed.<ref name="Tomasevich447<U+2013>448"/>

==Commemoration==
