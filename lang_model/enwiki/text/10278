'''4chan''' is an [[English-language]] [[imageboard]] [[website]] based on the [[Japanese-language]] [[Futaba Channel]]. Launched on October 1, 2003 by "moot" (allegedly "[[#moot's identity|Christopher Poole]]"), its boards are primarily used for the posting of pictures and discussion of [[manga]] and [[anime]]. Users generally post anonymously, and the site has been linked to "[[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]" culture and [[Project Chanology]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' describes 4chan as "at once brilliant, ridiculous and alarming".<ref name=TakingRick />

The "/b/" board is by far 4chan's most popular forum. It is known as the "random" board; there are minimal rules on posted content. It is thus notorious on the Internet; [[Gawker.com]] claimed in jest that "reading /b/ will melt your brain".<ref name=Gawker /> 

The site has generated broad media attention, and its members have been responsible for the formation and popularization of [[Internet meme]]s such as [[lolcat]]s, [[rickrolling]], and the popularity of the [[Tay Zonday]] song "[[Chocolate Rain]]".  It has also received media attention for its attacks against other websites and Internet users, and for the threats of real world violence that have been posted on it.

==Background==
4chan was started in 2003 in the bedroom of "moot", a 15 year old male from New York City.<ref name=wsj/> He intended the site to be a place to discuss [[manga|Japanese comic]]s and [[anime|television shows]], an American counterpart to the popular Japanese [[Futaba Channel]] boards. moot purchased the [[web server|server]] space for 4chan using his mother's credit card, with her approval.<ref name=wsj /><ref name=time /> Prior to starting 4chan, moot had been a regular participant on the [[Something Awful]] [[internet forum|forums]].<ref name=TheStar />

The activity of 4chan takes place on [[message board]]s and [[imageboard]]s.<Ref name=what4chan>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#what4chan |title=FAQ - What is 4chan?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref><ref name=Gawker /> The boards are split into five categories; [[Japanese Culture]], Interests, Creative, Adult (18+), Other, and Misc (18+). The categories include boards on topics such as anime, [[manga]], technology, sport, photography, music, [[hentai]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]]s, travel, physical fitness, and [[#/b/|random]]. 4chan once hosted discussion boards on a separate domain called "world4ch", but these were later moved to the dis.4chan.org subdomain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#were |title=FAQ - What were 4channel and world4ch?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> The site has one employee; a [[programmer]] who moot met via online ''[[Tetris]]''. All other [[Forum moderator|moderators]] are volunteers.<ref name=wsj />

Because 4chan is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], its financing often becomes problematic. moot acknowledges that donations alone can not keep the site online, so he has turned to advertising to help make ends meet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#95 |title=The long and short of it|publisher=4chan| author=moot| date=2008-02-12|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> However, the pornographic content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site's content from advertising.<ref name=time /> 4chan's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] rank is generally around 1000,<ref name=Alexa>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/4chan.org |title=4chan.org - Site Information|publisher=[[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> though it has been as high as number 56 at times.<ref name=landers /> 4chan is one of the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, according to ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name=swat />

Unlike most web forums, 4chan does not have a registration system, allowing users to post [[Anonymity|anonymously]].<ref name=TheStar>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955 |title=Funny how `stupid' site is addictive|publisher=''[[The Toronto Star]]''|author=Jerry Langton|date=2007-09-22|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#postanon |title=FAQ - How do I post anonymously?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as "Anonymous" or "moot".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#register |title=FAQ - Can I register a username?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> In place of registration, 4chan has provided [[tripcode]]s as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#trip |title=FAQ - How do I use a "tripcode"?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> As making a post without filling in the "Name" field causes posts to be attributed to "Anonymous", a [[running gag]] on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person, but a collective of 4chan users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#anonymous |title=FAQ - Who is "Anonymous"?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Moderators will generally post without a name even when performing [[system operator|sysops]] actions.

==Links to Anonymous and Project Chanology==
{{see also|Anonymous (group)|Project Chanology}}
4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] meme by The ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'',<ref name="landers">{{cite news | author =Chris Landers | title =Serious Business | work =[[Baltimore City Paper]] | date =2008-03-02 | url =http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543 | accessdate = 2008-07-13 }}</ref> due to the norm of posts signed with the "Anonymous" moniker.  The ''[[National Post]]''{{'}}s David George-Cosh said it has been "widely reported" that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and [[Imageboard|711chan]], as well as numerous [[Internet Relay Chat]] channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=db57d8d2-ca06-4fe0-8a8b-4975100f7231 |title=Online group declares war on Scientology|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|author=David George-Cosh|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>

Through its association with Anonymous, 4chan has become associated with [[Project Chanology]], an organization that holds worldwide protests against the [[Church of Scientology]]. On January 15, 2008 a 4chan user posted to /b/, suggesting participants "do something big" against the Church of Scientology's website. This message resulted in the Church receiving, by its own reports, more than 6,000 threatening phone calls. Unlike previous Anonymous attacks, this action was characterized by 4chan inside jokes, including [[Rickrolling|rickroll]]s and [[Guy Fawkes]] masks. The raid drew criticism from some 4chan users who felt it would bring the site unnecessary attention.<ref name="landers" />

==/b/==
The "[[random]]" board, /b/, follows the design of Futaba Channel's Nijiura board. It is by far 4chan's most popular board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#101 |title=/b/|publisher=4chan|author=moot|date=2008-07-11|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> [[Gawker.com]]'s Nick Douglas summarizes /b/ as a board where "people try to shock, entertain, and coax free porn from each other".<Ref name=Gawker>{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/346385/what-the-hell-are-4chan-ed-something-awful-and-b?mail2=true |title=What The Hell Are 4chan, ED, Something Awful, And "b"?|publisher=[[Gawker.com]]|author=Nick Douglas|date=2008-01-18|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> Certain post numbers are sought after with a large amount of posting taking place to "GET" them. A "GET" occurs when a post's number ends in a special number, such as 12345678, 22222222, or every millionth post.<ref name="faqget">{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#get|title=FAQ on GETs|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> A sign of 4chan's scaling, according to moot, was when GETs lost meaning due to the high post rate resulting in a GET occurring every few weeks. moot estimated /b/'s post rate in July 2008 to be 150-200,000 posts per day.<ref name=blog />

/b/ has a "no rules" policy, save for a ban on certain illegal content, such as [[child pornography]], invasions of other websites, and under-18 viewing, all of which are inherited from site-wide rules. This "no rules" policy applies to administrator and moderator actions as well, meaning that users may be banned at any time, for any reason, including no reason at all.<ref name="4chanTOS">{{cite web| url=http://www.4chan.org/rules.php#b |title=4chan - Rules - /b/ - Random|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref> Due partially to its anonymous nature, board moderation is not always successful<U+2014>indeed, the site's anti-child pornography rule is the subject of jokes on /b/.<ref name=landers /> moot told ''[[The New York Times]]'', in a discussion on the moderation of /b/, that "the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards" and that site staff simply provided a framework.<ref name=nytimes />

The humor of /b/'s many users, who refer to themselves as "/b/tards",<ref name=Wired /> is often incomprehensible to newcomers and outsiders, and is characterized by intricate [[In-joke|inside joke]]s and [[black comedy]].<ref name=Wired>{{cite web| url = http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-02/mf_goons?currentPage=all | title =  Mutilated Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers| author = [[Julian Dibbell]]| work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]| date = 2008-01-18| accessdate = 2008-01-18}}</ref> Users will often refer to each other, and much of the outside world, as "[[Faggot (slang)|fag]]s".<ref name=landers /> They are often referred to by outsiders as [[troll (internet)|trolls]], who regularly act with the intention of accumulating "[[lulz]]"<U+2014>a variation of "[[LOL]]" used to denote laughter at another's expense.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all |title=Malwebolence|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|author=Mattathias Schwartz|date=2008-08-03| accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/opinion/columnists/story.html?id=94f40e62-2db2-4917-8e21-e17b9a25b2db&p=1 |title=You'll miss us when we're gone|publisher=''[[The National Post]]''|author=Jonathan Kay|date=2008-08-06|accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref> Douglas said of the board, "reading /b/ will melt your brain", and cited [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]'s definition of /b/ as "the asshole of the Internet".<Ref name=Gawker /> Mattathias Schwartz of ''The New York Times'' likened /b/ to a "a high-school bathroom stall, or an obscene telephone party line",<ref name=nytimes /> while ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'' wrote that "/b/ is the kid with a collection of butterfly knives and a locker full of porn&nbsp;... in the high school of the Internet".<ref name=landers /> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' describes /b/ as notorious.<ref name=Wired />

==Memes==
[[Internet memes]] are catchphrases or images that spread quickly, [[peer to peer]], across the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2000/aug/10/technology |title=It's all in the memes|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|author=Karl Hodge |date=2000-08-10|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Many Internet memes have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving nature enables content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers. The most notable<!-- best choice of word? --> of these memes are [[lolcats]], [[rickrolling]], and "[[Chocolate Rain]]". Other memes originating on the site have gained media attention of a lesser degree. These include "So I herd u liek [[mudkip]]z"{{sic}}, which involves a phrase based on [[Pokemon]], and which generated numerous YouTube tribute videos.<ref name=TheStar /> 4chan, and other websites, such as the satirical [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], have also contributed to the development of significant amounts of [[leetspeak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece |title=Scientology: the Anonymous protestors|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=Caitlin Moran |date=2008-06-20|accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref>

===lolcats===
{{main|lolcat}}
[[Image:Squeaks Gatito Tigre.jpg|thumb|The lolcat replying to the question "I can has cheezburger?"]]
In 2005, the lolcat meme began on 4chan as "Caturday". Every Saturday, users posted pictures of cats with [[image macro]]s relating to that day's theme.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/2007/11/14/News/Iz.Not.Cats.Everywhere.Online.Trend.Spreads.Across.Campus-3099929.shtml |title = Iz not cats everywhere?

Neither of these were related to the day's theme, and following this, the "rule" that cat pictures had to relate to a theme was lifted. The lolcat meme later spread to other animals; an example being the [[O RLY?]] owl<U+2014>an image macro of the words "O RLY?" superimposed on an image<!-- Media: link here--> of the [[Snowy Owl]], generally used in sarcasm.<ref name=TheStar />

===rickrolling===
{{main|rickrolling}}
In 2005, the meme of the "duckroll" began when moot used a [[word filter]] to change "egg" to "duck" across 4chan. Thus, words such as "eggroll" were changed to "duckroll". This led to a [[bait and switch]] in which external links disguised as relevant to a discussion instead lead to a picture of a duck on wheels.<ref name=FOXmemes>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream|publisher=[[FOX News]]|date=2008-04-22|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref> 

In March 2007, the [[Marketing_for_Grand_Theft_Auto_IV|trailer]] for the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' was released. Its immense popularity caused publisher [[Rockstar Games]]' website to [[crash (computing)|crash]]. An unidentified 4chan user applied the duckroll on a link to the site to link to a [[YouTube]] video for [[Rick Astley]]'s "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]" instead of a picture of a duck. Thus, the "rickroll" was born.<ref name=FOXmemes /> In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Astley said he found the meme "bizarre and funny".<ref name=TakingRick>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/19/news |title=Taking the Rick|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|author=Sean Michaels|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref><ref name=FOXmemes /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/rick-astley-kin.html |title=Web Scout exclusive!

On January 9, 2006, [[eBaum's World]] violated copyright laws in hosting an image of [[Lindsay Lohan]] originally posted on [[YTMND]]. As a result, users of 4chan, YTMND, Something Awful, and [[Newgrounds]] participated in a "raid" against the site including a [[Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack|distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attack, and flooding of the website's [[chat room]], [[Internet forum|forums]] and [[technical support]].
