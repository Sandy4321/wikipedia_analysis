"'''The Impossible Planet'''" is an [[list of Doctor Who serials|episode]] in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It is the first part of a two-part story, followed by "[[The Satan Pit]]". The [[TARDIS]] lands in a base on a planet orbiting a [[black hole]], an allegedly impossible situation that stumps even the Doctor. The base crew are drilling to the centre of the world, to claim the power that keeps it in orbit for the good of the Human Empire. However, an ancient evil is down there too, and it is awakened.  

The story was first broadcast on 3 June 2006.

==Plot==
The [[TARDIS]] arrives inside a "Sanctuary Base" used for deep-space expeditions; as [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] explore it, they discover strange alien writing that the TARDIS is unable to translate. After a slight misunderstanding when first meeting the [[Ood]], a docile race of empathic servants who work on the station, the travellers meet the crew of the base, led by acting Captain Zachary Cross Flane. The crew, which includes Science Officer Ida Scott, Head of Security Mr Jefferson, Ethics Committee Rep Danny Bartock, Trainee Maintenance Scooti Manista, and archaeologist Toby Zed, are on an expedition on an anomalous planet, named "Krop Tor", in orbit around a black hole. Zack explains that a gravity well exists around the planet, allowing them to safely enter or leave the [[event horizon]] of the black hole, and that it is generated by an immense energy force ten miles within it, which they are drilling towards to understand its power. As the Doctor and Rose are acquainting themselves with the crew, the base is struck by a planet-quake, causing the section of the base containing the TARDIS to fall into the planet, and the two become resigned to help out the crew.

As the drill nears its target, a malevolent presence begins to make itself known; the Ood's translation spheres reveal messages about the [[List of Doctor Who villains#Beast|Beast]] awaking, while Toby is unknowingly possessed by the Beast. When Scooti comes to investigate the airlock opening and closing, she finds Toby outside without a spacesuit. She is hypnotised and her hand starts to raise. She tells him to stop and Toby begins breaking the glass. She runs to the door and screams at it to open; however, it refuses and Toby breaks the glass. Air rushes out of the base dragging Scooti with it, sending her screaming to her death in the vacuum of space. When drilling is complete, the Doctor offers to go with Ida into the bowels of the planet. After travelling down the shaft, the Doctor and Ida find a large circular disk, inscribed with more undecipherable markings, which the Doctor believes is a door. As they watch, the door begins to open; simultaneously, the Beast repossesses Toby and the Ood. The possessed Toby warns Rose and the remaining crew that the planet is now falling towards the black hole, and that the Beast is free, while the Ood, now claiming to be the [[Legion (demon)|Legion]] of the Beast, begin to close in on them, whilst the voice of the Beast says; "The pit is open and I am free...!". As Ida and the Doctor look down into the pit, malevolent, demonic laughter emanantes from below...

===Cast notes===
*The voice of the Beast is provided by [[Gabriel Woolf]], who is best known in ''Doctor Who'' for playing [[List of Doctor Who villains#Sutekh|Sutekh the Destroyer]] in the [[Fourth Doctor]] serial ''[[Pyramids of Mars]]'' (1975). One of the names that the possessed Ood have for the Beast is Satan. Coincidentally, the Fourth Doctor states that Sutekh has been known by many aliases, including the Typhonian beast and Satan. However, Woolf was cast only after the episode had been written and filmed.<ref>''Doctor Who Magazine'' #371<!--page numbers, author, etc. would be nice...--></ref>
*Writer [[Matt Jones (writer)|Matt Jones]] also wrote, as Matthew Jones, the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Bad Therapy]]'', featuring the [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Chris Cwej]]. He was script editor on [[Russell T Davies]]' [[Channel 4]] series ''[[Queer as Folk (UK)|Queer as Folk]]''. 
*Shaun Parkes previously starred with David Tennant in the BBC's 2005 ''[[Casanova (2005 TV serial)|Casanova]]'' serial written by Russell T Davies. He was also in ''[[Things To Do Before You're 30|Things to Do Before You're 30]]'' with Billie Piper.
*Silas Carson previously played various alien voices in ''[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End Of The World]]'', as well as several characters in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequel trilogy, most notably [[Jedi]] master [[Ki Adi Mundi]].
*Paul Kasey also plays a [[Weevil (Torchwood)|Weevil]] and [[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#Blowfish|Blowfish]] in [[Torchwood]], alongside many other monsters & aliens in Doctor Who including the [[Cybermen]] and [[Judoon]]

==Continuity==
*The Doctor encountered adversaries who used a black hole in ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' and ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]''. The Tractators in ''[[Frontios]]'' could also control gravity.
*The TARDIS arrives randomly and the Doctor asks 'her' what's wrong and postulates [[indigestion]]. The TARDIS was previously said to be suffering indigestion after 'swallowing' the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] via the [[Eye of Harmony]] <U+2013> also a black hole <U+2013> in the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|TV movie]].
*Zack mentions that he took over when Captain Walker, the original expedition commander, was lost on the voyage in. Captain Walker appears in the [[TARDISODE]] accompanying this episode, seen being given the assignment to go to Krop Tor.
*In the episode the human government is "the Empire". When reporting Scooti's death, Jefferson gives what appears to be the date as "Forty-three K, two point one". Although no further explanation is given for what the numbers mean, this episode is set no earlier than 200 years before "[[Planet of the Ood]]", set in 4126, as the translator devices were created 200 years before that point.
*Rose refers to the dinner lady job she had in "[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]" when talking to an Ood serving food.
*The Doctor mentions that TARDISes are grown rather than built. However, this seemingly contradicts ''[[Warriors' Gate]]'', in which it is mentioned that [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] has a full set of TARDIS blueprints and [[Romana#Romana II|Romana]] can build one with the help of the time-sensitive Tharils. [[Omega (Doctor Who)|Omega]] also boasted that he would be able to build a new TARDIS while stranded on 20th century Earth in ''[[Arc of Infinity]]''. Actor [[John Barrowman]] mirrored this comment when talking about the piece of "[[List of Torchwood items#T|TARDIS coral]]" [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack]] keeps in his office at "[[Torchwood Institute|the Hub]]" in a special feature in ''[[Radio Times]]'' October 28<U+2013>November 3, 2006, he also mentioned a "carving process" which may mean that these previous comments are still correct if one has access to enough "TARDIS coral". Another "grown" spaceship was seen in the [[Seventh Doctor]] serial ''[[Battlefield (Doctor Who)|Battlefield]]'' (1989). 
*This episode sees Rose's "[[List of Doctor Who items#S|Superphone]]" lose its signal for the first time; however, it is still able to receive a message from the Beast. Rose's mobile phone is a different unit from her previous one, as the Doctor gave the old one to [[Mickey Smith|Mickey]] at the end of "[[The Age of Steel]]" in order to defeat the remaining dormant [[Cyberman|Cybermen]]. 
*At one point toward the end of the episode, the (recently possessed) Ood begin to list the names that have been used to label "The Beast".  One of them happens to be [[Abaddon]], an ancient demon, who features as a major element in the episode [[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]] of the spin-off series [[Torchwood]].

==Production==
*Scenes of bodies floating in space were filmed on the underwater stage at [[Pinewood Studios]], the first time the series has used this facility, not counting the charity special ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]''.
*In the accompanying ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode, "You've Got the Look", Russell T Davies said that he likes to think that the Ood come from a planet near to that of the Sensorites from the [[First Doctor]] serial ''[[The Sensorites]]'' (1964), as he suggests the races are similar in some respects. In "[[Planet of the Ood]]", this is confirmed.
*This is the first episode of the 2005 revival of ''Doctor Who'' to use a quarry as an alien planet <U+2014> quarries were frequently used in this manner in the original series. Other familiar elements include video-overlay holograms (''[[Earthshock]]'', 1982) and the "base under siege" motif used in many ''Doctor Who'' stories.
*This episode features no direct reference to ''[[Torchwood]]'', unlike most of the others in this series. However, like "[[Bad Wolf]]" in the 2005 series, such references would only appear in one half of a two-part story, as is evident with the one made in "The Satan Pit". 
*For the first time in the 2006 series the tie-in game to this episode<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/game8/index.shtml Flight Simulator<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is not on the ''Defending the Earth!'' website,<ref>[http://www.whoisdoctorwho.co.uk Defending the Earth! Because friends stick together<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> although it can be found on the BBC ''Doctor Who'' website.
*In the commentary for "The Satan Pit", producer and chief writer, [[Russell T Davies]], said that an early draft of the script called for the role of the Ood to be filled by Raxacoricofallapatorians, the same species as the [[Slitheen]]. Their race would have been enslaved and they wished to awaken the Beast, whom they believed to be a god that could free them.
*The Ood masks had their eyes in non-human positions, so the actors who played them were essentially blind.
*During an interview with the production crew, it was noted that the sanctuary base was based on the spaceship ''Nostromo'' from the movie ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.
*Executive producer Russell T Davies cited this episode's expensive production as a reason why much of the new series' stories are set on present-day Earth.<ref>BBC: ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5359552.stm Cost 'keeps Doctor Who on earth']''. 19th September 2006.</ref>

==Outside references==
*This episode has numerous references to [[Hell]], and the [[Number of the Beast]], 666. The Doctor states that the power source to generate the gravitational field would have to be "6<sup>6</sup> every 6 seconds"; a character announces that a computer readout is 66.6; the room where the TARDIS was parked was Base Storage 6; the story's two episodes are broadcast on either side of the week of 6 June 2006 (06/06/06).
*As they watch Scooti drift towards the black hole, Jefferson recites the lines, "And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, / For the ashes of his fathers, and the temples of his Gods," from [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s 1842 poem ''[[s:Horatius|Horatius]]'', Stanza XXVII, about the heroism of [[Horatius Cocles]].
*The Doctor's line "This'll be the best Christmas [[Walford]] has ever had" is a reference to the long-running soap ''[[EastEnders]]'', in which Christmas storylines are generally miserable despite characters proclaiming the above hope.
*The scenes on Krop Tor and the Pit were filmed in a quarry; the number plate of the quarry manager's car ended in OOD.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}
*The differential forms of [[Maxwell's equations]] can clearly be seen written on the table that the Doctor and Rose are sitting at while they are watching the Scarlet System being swallowed by the black hole.
*Both the physical appearance of the Ood and the concept of a sleeping, malevolent entity are reminiscent of the [[Cthulhu]] stories of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].
*Some of the off-screen door opening and closing sound effects are taken from the original [[Doom (video game)]].
*During the night shift, [[Maurice Ravel]]'s [[Bol<U+00E9>ro]] is played around the base.
*When the possessed Ood first identify themselves as 'Legion', they quote directly from the [[Gospel of Mark]] - "My name is [[Legion (demon)|Legion]]: for we are many."

==Broadcast and DVD release==
*This is the first episode to be given a rating beyond 5 by the BBC's fear forecasters. The episode was given a rating of 6 - Amy, the youngest, rating it a 3, and the other three rating it a six, making the number "[[Number of the Beast|666]]" visible.<ref>{{cite news
