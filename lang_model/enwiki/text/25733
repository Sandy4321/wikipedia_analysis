'''Frank Vincent Zappa''' (December 21, 1940&nbsp;<U+2013> December 4, 1993) was an American musician, songwriter, composer, recording engineer, record producer, and film director. In a career spanning more than 30&nbsp;years, Zappa composed rock, [[jazz]], orchestral and ''[[musique concr<U+00E8>te]]'' works. He also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. Zappa produced almost all of the more than 60&nbsp;albums he released with the band [[The Mothers of Invention]] and as a solo artist. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as [[Edgard Var<U+00E8>se]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]] along with 1950s [[rhythm and blues]] music. He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands; he later switched to electric guitar.

Zappa was a self-taught composer and performer, and his diverse musical influences led him to create music that was often difficult to categorize. His 1966 debut album with The Mothers of Invention, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. His later albums shared this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was  rock, jazz or classical. His lyrics<U+2014>often humorously<U+2014>reflected his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] view of established social and political processes, structures and movements. He was a strident critic of mainstream education and [[organized religion]], and a forthright and passionate advocate for [[freedom of speech]], [[autodidacticism|self-education]], political participation and the abolition of censorship.

He was a highly productive and prolific artist and gained widespread critical acclaim. He had some commercial success, particularly in Europe, and worked as an independent artist for most of his career. He also remains a major influence on musicians and composers. Zappa was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1995 and received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1997. Zappa was married to Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman from 1960 to 1964. In 1967, he married [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]], with whom he remained until his death from [[prostate cancer]] in 1993. They had four children: [[Moon Zappa|Moon]], [[Dweezil Zappa|Dweezil]], [[Ahmet Zappa|Ahmet]] and [[Diva Zappa|Diva]]. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him at No. 71 on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time", and in 2011 at No. 22 on its list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".

==Early life==
Frank Vincent Zappa<ref name="Francis" /> was born in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, on December 21, 1940. His mother, Rose Marie (n<U+00E9>e Colimore), was of [[Italian American|Italian]] and [[French American|French]] ancestry; his father, Francis Vincent Zappa, was an immigrant from [[Partinico]], Sicily.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book''. pg. 5</ref> Zappa, the eldest of four children,  was raised in an Italian-American household where Italian was spoken often by his grandparents.<ref name="Rolling Stone Book">''The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'', 1993.</ref><ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book''. pg. 6</ref> The family moved often because his father, a [[chemist]] and [[mathematician]], worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to [[Maryland]], where Zappa's father worked at the [[Edgewood, Maryland|Edgewood]] Arsenal [[chemical warfare]] facility of the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored [[sulfur mustard|mustard gas]], gas masks were kept in the home.<ref name="chemicals">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 20<U+2013>23.</ref> This had a profound effect on Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 8<U+2013>9.</ref>

Zappa was often sick as a child, suffering from [[asthma]], [[Otalgia|earaches]] and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]] problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of [[radium]] into each of Zappa's nostrils; little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation.<ref name="Milesp10">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 10.</ref> Nasal imagery and references appear in his music and lyrics, as well as in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator [[Cal Schenkel]]. Many of Zappa's childhood diseases may have been due to exposure to mustard gas. His health worsened when he lived in [[Baltimore]].<ref name="chemicals"/><ref name="Milesp10"/> In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 22.</ref> They moved, next, to [[Monterey, California]], where his father taught [[metallurgy]] at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]]. They soon moved to [[Claremont, California|Claremont]],<ref>{{cite book

Zappa recalled his parents being "pretty religious" and tried to make him to go to Catholic school despite his resentment. Zappa showed disgust towards religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promotes ignorance and [[anti-intellectualism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview in Playboy|url=http://zappa.rockmetal.art.pl/wywiady/playboy.htm|publisher=Playboy|date=May 2, 1993}}</ref>

===Musical influences===
{{quote box|quote="Since I didn't have any kind of formal training, it didn't make any difference to me if I was listening to Lightnin' Slim, or a vocal group called [[the Jewels]]&nbsp;... , or Webern, or Var<U+00E8>se, or Stravinsky. To me it was all good music."|source=<U+2014>Frank Zappa, 1989<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 34.</ref>|width=25em}}

Zappa joined his first band at [[Mission Bay High School]] in San Diego. He was the band's drummer.<ref name="zappa29">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 29.</ref> About the same time his parents bought a phonograph, which allowed him to develop his interest in music, and to begin building his record collection.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 22.</ref>
[[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singles were early purchases, starting a large collection he kept for the rest of his life.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 36.</ref> He was interested in sounds for their own sake, particularly the sounds of drums and other percussion instruments. By age 12, he had obtained a snare drum and began learning the basics of orchestral percussion.<ref name="zappa29"/> Zappa's deep interest in modern classical music began<ref name="idol"/> when he read a ''[[Look (American magazine)|LOOK]]'' magazine article about the [[Sam Goody]] record store chain that lauded its ability to sell an LP as obscure as ''The Complete Works of Edgard Var<U+00E8>se, Volume One''.<ref name="Varese">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 30<U+2013>33.</ref> The article described [[Edgard Var<U+00E8>se|Var<U+00E8>se's]] percussion composition ''[[Ionisation (Var<U+00E8>se)|Ionisation]]'', produced by [[EMS Recordings]], as "a weird jumble of drums and other unpleasant sounds". Zappa decided to seek out Var<U+00E8>se's music. After searching for over a year, Zappa found a copy (he noticed the LP because of the "mad scientist" looking photo of Var<U+00E8>se on the cover). Not having enough money with him, he persuaded the salesman to sell him the record at a discount.<ref name="Varese"/> Thus began his lifelong passion for Var<U+00E8>se's music and that of other modern classical composers.

Zappa grew up influenced by [[avant-garde]] composers such as Var<U+00E8>se, [[Halim El-Dabh]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Electronic and experimental music: technology, music, and culture|first=Thom|last=Holmes|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2008|isbn=0-415-95781-8|chapter=Early Synthesizers and Experimenters|pages=153<U+2013>4|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hCthQ-bec-QC&pg=PA153|accessdate=2011-06-04}}</ref> [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Anton Webern]], R&B and [[doo-wop]] groups (particularly local [[pachuco]] groups), and modern jazz. His own heterogeneous ethnic background, and the diverse social and cultural mix in and around greater Los Angeles, were crucial in the formation of Zappa as a practitioner of [[underground music]] and of his later distrustful and openly critical attitude towards "mainstream" social, political and musical movements. He frequently lampooned musical fads like [[psychedelia]], [[rock opera]] and [[disco]].<ref name="watson13">Watson, 1996, ''Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play'', p. 13.</ref><ref>Among his many musical satires are the 1967 songs "Flower Punk" (which parodies the song "[[Hey Joe]]") and "Who Needs The Peace Corps?", which are critiques of the late-Sixties commercialization of the [[hippie]] phenomenon.</ref> Television also exerted a strong influence, as demonstrated by quotations from show themes and advertising jingles found in his later works.<ref name="quotes"/>

==1955<U+2013>60: Youth and early career==
[[File:Frank Zappa HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|Zappa's senior yearbook photo, 1958.]]
By 1956, the Zappa family had moved to [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], a small [[aerospace]] and farming town in the [[Antelope Valley]] of the [[Mojave Desert]] close to [[Edwards Air Force Base]], in northern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. Zappa's mother encouraged him in his musical interests. Although she disliked Var<U+00E8>se's music, she was indulgent enough to give her son a long distance call to the composer as a 15th birthday present.<ref name="Varese"/> Unfortunately, Var<U+00E8>se was in Europe at the time, so Zappa spoke to the composer's wife. He later received a letter from Var<U+00E8>se thanking him for his interest, and telling him about a composition he was working on called "[[D<U+00E9>serts]]". Living in the desert town of Lancaster, Zappa found this very exciting. Var<U+00E8>se invited him to visit if he ever came to New York. The meeting never took place (Var<U+00E8>se died in 1965), but Zappa framed the letter and kept it on display for the rest of his life.<ref name="idol">{{cite journal| last = Zappa | first = Frank | title = Edgard Varese: The Idol of My Youth | journal=Stereo Review | pages = 61<U+2013>62. |date=June 1971}}</ref><ref>On several of his earlier albums, Zappa paid tribute to Var<U+00E8>se by quoting his: "The present-day composer refuses to die."</ref>

At [[Antelope Valley High School]], Zappa met Don Vliet (who later expanded his name to Don Van Vliet and adopted the stage name [[Captain Beefheart]]). Zappa and Vliet became close friends, sharing an interest in R&B records and influencing each other musically throughout their careers.<ref>Slaven, 2003, ''Electric Don Quixote'', pp. 29<U+2013>30.</ref> Around the same time, Zappa started playing drums in a local band, The Blackouts.<ref name="watson13"/> The band was racially diverse, and included [[Euclid James Sherwood|Euclid James "Motorhead" Sherwood]] who later became a member of The Mothers of Invention. Zappa's interest in the guitar grew, and in 1957 he was given his first guitar. Among his early influences were [[Johnny "Guitar" Watson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]] and [[Clarence "Gatemouth" Brown]].<ref>{{citation | date= November 1976 | people = Mike Douglas |title = The Mike Douglas Show |publisher=NBC [TV Show] }}</ref> (In the 1970s and '80s, he invited Watson to perform on several albums.) Zappa considered soloing as the equivalent of forming "air sculptures",<ref name="DZlinernotes"/> and developed an eclectic, innovative and highly personal style.

Zappa's interest in composing and arranging proliferated in his last high-school years. By his final year, he was writing, [[arrangement|arranging]] and conducting avant-garde performance pieces for the school orchestra.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 40.</ref> He graduated from Antelope Valley High School in 1958, and later acknowledged two of his music teachers on the sleeve of the 1966 album ''Freak Out!''<ref>Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 23.</ref> Due to his family's frequent moves, Zappa attended at least six different high schools, and as a student he was often bored and given to distracting the rest of the class with juvenile antics.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 48.</ref> He left community college after one semester, and maintained thereafter a disdain for formal education, taking his children out of school at age 15 and refusing to pay for their college.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 345.</ref>

Zappa left home in 1959, and moved into a small apartment in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]], Los Angeles. After meeting Kathryn J. "Kay" Sherman during his short stay at [[Pomona College]], they moved in together in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]], and were married December 28, 1960.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 58.</ref> Zappa worked for a short period in advertising. His sojourn in the commercial world was brief, but gave him valuable insights into its workings.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 40.</ref> Throughout his career, he took a keen interest in the visual presentation of his work, designing some of his album covers and directing his own films and videos.

==Early 1960s: Studio Z==
Zappa attempted to earn a living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with a new version of The Blackouts.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 59.</ref> Financially more rewarding were Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films ''[[The World's Greatest Sinner]]'' (1962) and ''Run Home Slow'' (1965). The former score was commissioned by actor-producer [[Timothy Carey]] and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 63.</ref> The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 55.</ref> Excerpts from the soundtrack can be heard on the posthumous album ''[[The Lost Episodes]]'' (1996).

During the early 1960s, Zappa wrote and produced songs for other local artists, often working with singer-songwriter [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] and producer Paul Buff. Their "[[Memories of El Monte]]" was recorded by [[The Penguins]], although only Cleve Duncan of the original group was featured.<ref>Gray, 1984, ''Mother!'', p. 29.</ref> Buff owned the small [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cucamonga]], which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. At that time, only a handful of the most sophisticated commercial studios had [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 42.</ref> Although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money to allow him to stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 74.</ref> He appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s syndicated late night show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument.<ref>Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', pp. 35<U+2013>36.</ref> With Captain Beefheart, Zappa recorded some songs under the name of The Soots. They were rejected by [[Dot Records]] for having "no commercial potential", a verdict Zappa subsequently quoted on the sleeve of ''[[Freak Out!]]''<ref>Watson, 1996, ''Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play'', p. 27.</ref>

In 1964, after his marriage started to break up, he moved into the Pal studio and began routinely working 12&nbsp;hours or more per day recording and experimenting with [[overdubbing]] and [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording#As a musical instrument|audio tape manipulation]]. This established a work pattern that endured for most of his life.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 43.</ref> Aided by his income from film composing, Zappa took over the studio from Paul Buff, who was now working with [[Art Laboe]] at [[Original Sound]]. It was renamed Studio Z.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 80<U+2013>81.</ref> Studio Z was rarely booked for recordings by other musicians. Instead, friends moved in, notably James "Motorhead" Sherwood.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa''. pp. 82<U+2013>83.</ref> Zappa started performing as guitarist with a [[power trio]], The Muthers, in local bars in order to support himself.<ref>Watson, 1996, ''Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play'', p. 26.</ref>

An article in the local press describing Zappa as "the Movie King of Cucamonga" prompted the local police to suspect that he was making [[pornography|pornographic]] films.<ref name="MilesBust">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 85.</ref> In March 1965, Zappa was approached by a [[Vice unit|vice squad]] undercover officer, and accepted an offer of $100 to produce a suggestive audio tape for an alleged [[Bachelor party|stag party]]. Zappa and a female friend recorded a faked erotic episode. When Zappa was about to hand over the tape, he was arrested, and the police stripped the studio of all recorded material.<ref name="MilesBust"/> The press was tipped off beforehand, and next day's ''The Daily Report'' wrote that "Vice Squad investigators stilled the tape recorders of a free-swinging, a-go-go film and recording studio here Friday and arrested a self-styled movie producer".<ref>{{citation | last= Harp| first= Ted | title = Vice Squad Raids Local Film Studio | newspaper=The Daily Report | place = Ontario, California | date = March, 1965 }}</ref> Zappa was charged with "conspiracy to commit pornography".<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 57.</ref> This [[felony]] charge was reduced and he was sentenced to six months in jail on a [[misdemeanor]], with all but ten days suspended.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 86<U+2013>87.</ref> His brief imprisonment left a permanent mark, and was key in the formation of his anti-authoritarian stance.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. XV.</ref> Zappa lost several recordings made at Studio Z in the process, as the police only returned 30 out of 80 hours of tape seized.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 87.</ref> Eventually, he could no longer afford to pay the rent on the studio and was evicted.<ref>Slaven, 1996, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p. 40.</ref> Zappa managed to recover some of his possessions before the studio was torn down in 1966.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 90<U+2013>91.</ref>

==Late 1960s: The Mothers of Invention==
In 1965, Zappa was approached by [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]] who asked him to take over as the guitarist in local R&B band the Soul Giants, following a fight between Collins and the group's original guitarist.<ref name="Rolling Stone Book"/> Zappa accepted, and soon he assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer (even though he never considered himself a singer<ref name="HighTimes1980"/>). He convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract.<ref name="zappa65">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 65<U+2013>66.</ref> The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on [[Mother's Day (United States)|Mother's Day]].<ref>Slaven, 2003, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p. 42.</ref> The group increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager [[Herb Cohen]], while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles [[underground music]] scene.<ref>Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 58.</ref> In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] when playing "Trouble Every Day", a song about the [[Watts Riots]].<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 103.</ref> Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Simon & Garfunkel]], and was notable as one of the few African-Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time. Wilson signed The Mothers to the [[Verve Records|Verve]] division of [[MGM Records|MGM]], which had built up a strong reputation for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves [[The Mothers of Invention]] as ''Mother'' was short for ''[[motherfucker]]''<U+2014>a term that apart from its profane meanings can denote a skilled musician.<ref>

===1966: Debut album: ''Freak Out!''===
With Wilson credited as producer, The Mothers of Invention, augmented by a studio orchestra, recorded the groundbreaking ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966) which, after Bob Dylan's ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]'', was the second rock double album ever released. It mixed R&B, [[doo-wop]], musique concr<U+00E8>te,<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 25.</ref> and experimental [[sound collage]]s that captured the "freak" subculture of Los Angeles at that time.<ref>Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', pp. 60<U+2013>61.</ref> Although he was dissatisfied with the final product<U+2014>in a late '60s radio interview (included in the posthumous ''[[The MOFO Project/Object|MOFO Project/Object]]'' compilation) Zappa recounted that the side-long closing track "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet" was intended to be the basic track for a much more complex work which Verve did not allow him to complete<U+2014>''Freak Out'' immediately established Zappa as a radical new voice in rock music, providing an antidote to the "relentless consumer culture of America".<ref name="Miles">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 115.</ref> The sound was raw, but the [[arrangement]]s were sophisticated. While recording in the studio, some of the additional [[session musician]]s were shocked that they were expected to read the notes on sheet music from [[Chord chart|charts]] with Zappa conducting them, since it was not standard when recording rock music.<ref name="miles112">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 112.</ref> The lyrics praised non-conformity, disparaged authorities, and had [[dada]]ist elements. Yet, there was a place for seemingly conventional love songs.<ref>Watson, 2005, ''Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music'', pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref> Most compositions are Zappa's, which set a precedent for the rest of his recording career. He had full control over the arrangements and musical decisions and did most [[Overdubbing|overdubs]]. Wilson provided the industry clout and connections to get the group the financial resources needed.<ref name="Miles-2004">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 123.</ref>

During the recording of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa moved into a house in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]] with friend [[Suzy Creamcheese|Pamela Zarubica]], who appeared on the album.<ref name="miles112"/> The house became a meeting (and living) place for many LA musicians and [[groupie]]s of the time, despite Zappa's disapproval of their illicit drug use.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 122.</ref> After a short promotional tour following the release of ''Freak Out!'', Zappa met [[Gail Zappa|Adelaide Gail Sloatman]]. He fell in love within "a couple of minutes", and she moved into the house over the summer.<ref name="zappa65"/> They married in 1967, had four children and remained together until Zappa's death.

Wilson nominally produced The Mothers' second album ''[[Absolutely Free]]'' (1967), which was recorded in November 1966, and later [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] in New York, although by this time Zappa was in ''de facto'' control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by The Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements.<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 5.</ref> Examples are "Plastic People" and "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, but also of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', pp. 38<U+2013>43.</ref> As Zappa put it, "[W]e're satirists, and we are out to satirize everything."<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 135<U+2013>138.</ref> At the same time, Zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, ''[[Lumpy Gravy]]'', released by [[Capitol Records]] in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968.<ref name="Miles-2004_2">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 140<U+2013>141.</ref> It is an "incredible ambitious musical project",<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 56.</ref> a "monument to [[John Cage]]",<ref>Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 86.</ref> which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical [[audio engineer|audio editing]] techniques.<ref>{{citation | url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22630|pure_url=yes}} | title=Lumpy Gravy.

===1966<U+2013>68: New York period===
The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year.<ref>James, 2000, ''Necessity Is&nbsp;... '', pp. 62<U+2013>69.</ref> As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with The Mothers of Invention, moved to New York.<ref name="Miles-2004_2"/> Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa's famous hand signals.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 147.</ref> Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a "[[gook]] baby".<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 94.</ref>

Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, The Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (released 1968).<ref>{{citation | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22631|pure_url=yes}} | title = We're Only in It for the Money.

From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by The Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. ''We're Only in It for the Money'' featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the [[hippie]] and [[flower power]] phenomena.<ref>Watson, 2005, ''Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music'', p. 15.

Reflecting Zappa's eclectic approach to music, the next album, ''[[Cruising with Ruben & the Jets]]'' (1968), was very different. It represented a collection of [[doo-wop]] songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute.<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 58.</ref> Zappa has noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: "If he could take the forms and clich<U+00E9>s of the classical era and pervert them, why not do the same&nbsp;... to doo-wop in the fifties?"<ref name="zappa88">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 88.</ref> A theme from Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' is heard during one song.

In New York, Zappa increasingly used [[audio engineer|tape editing]] as a compositional tool.<ref name="cc">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 160.</ref> A prime example is found on the double album ''[[Uncle Meat]]'' (1969),<ref>James, 2000, '' Necessity Is&nbsp;...'', p. 104.</ref> where the track "King Kong" is edited from various studio and live performances. Zappa had begun regularly recording concerts,<ref>In the process, he built up a vast archive of live recordings.

Everything was connected, and musical themes and lyrics reappeared in different form on later albums. Conceptual continuity clues are found throughout Zappa's entire <U+0153>uvre.<ref name="quotes">For a comprehensive list of the appearance of parts of "old" compositions or quotes from others' music in Zappa's catalogue, see {{citation | url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/quotes.html |title= FZ Musical Quotes|last= Albertos |first= Rom<U+00E1>n Garc<U+00ED>a |series=Information is Not Knowledge | publisher=globia.net/donlope}}.

During the late 1960s, Zappa continued to develop the business sides of his career. He and Herb Cohen formed the [[Bizarre Records]] and [[Straight Records]] labels, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], as ventures to aid the funding of projects and to increase creative control. Zappa produced the double album ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' for [[Captain Beefheart]], and releases by [[Alice Cooper]], [[Wild Man Fischer]], and [[The GTOs]], as well as [[Lenny Bruce]]'s last live performance.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 173<U+2013>175.</ref>

[[File:Frank 1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Zappa with The Mothers of Invention, [[Boulevard de Clichy|Theatre de Clichy]], Paris, 1971]]
In 1969 there were nine band members and Zappa was supporting the group himself from his publishing [[royalties]] whether they played or not.<ref name="walley116"/> 1969 was also the year Zappa, fed up with MGM's interference, left MGM Records for Warner Bros. Records' [[Reprise Records]] subsidiary where Zappa/Mothers recordings would bear the Bizarre Records imprint.
In late 1969, Zappa broke up the band. He often cited the financial strain as the main reason,<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 107.</ref> but also commented on the band members' lack of sufficient effort.<ref>Slaven, 2003, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p. 120.</ref> Many band members were bitter about Zappa's decision, and some took it as a sign of Zappa's concern for perfection at the expense of human feeling.<ref name="MilesonBreakup">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 185<U+2013>187.</ref> Others were irritated by 'his [[Autocracy|autocratic]] ways',<ref name="Miles-2004"/> exemplified by Zappa's never staying at the same hotel as the band members.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 116.</ref> Several members would, however, play for Zappa in years to come. Remaining recordings with the band from this period were collected on ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'' and ''[[Burnt Weeny Sandwich]]'' (both released in 1970).

After he disbanded The Mothers of Invention, Zappa released the acclaimed solo album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' (1969).<ref>{{citation | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22632|pure_url=yes}} | last = Huey | first = Steve | title = Hot Rats.

It became a popular album in England,<ref name="ZOp109">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 109.</ref> and had a major influence on the development of the [[jazz-rock fusion]] genre.<ref name="hotrats">Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 74.</ref><ref name="mileshotrats"/>

==1970s: From The Mothers to Zappa==
In 1970 Zappa met conductor [[Zubin Mehta]]. They arranged a May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, the music was mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with The Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie ''[[200 Motels]]''.<ref name="ZOp109"/> Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one.<ref name="zappa88"/> His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt that the quality of performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 142<U+2013>156.</ref>

===1970: Rebirth of The Mothers and filmmaking===
[[File:FRANK ZAPPA3.jpg|thumb|right|Frank Zappa in Paris, early 1970s]]

Later in 1970, Zappa formed a new version of The Mothers (from then on, he mostly dropped the "of Invention"). It included British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], jazz keyboardist [[George Duke]], [[Ian Underwood]], [[Jeff Simmons (musician)|Jeff Simmons]] (bass, rhythm guitar), and three members of [[The Turtles]]: bass player [[Jim Pons]], and singers [[Mark Volman]] and [[Howard Kaylan]], who, due to persistent legal and contractual problems, adopted the stage name "The Phlorescent Leech and Eddie", or "[[Flo & Eddie]]".<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 201.</ref>

This version of The Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album ''[[Chunga's Revenge]]'' (1970),<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 205.</ref> which was followed by the double-album soundtrack to the movie ''200 Motels'' (1971), featuring The Mothers, The [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Theodore Bikel]], and [[Keith Moon]]. Co-directed by Zappa and [[Tony Palmer (director)|Tony Palmer]], it was filmed in a week at [[Pinewood Studios]] outside London.<ref name="Watson200"/> Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting.<ref name="Watson200">Watson, 1996, ''Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play'', p. 183.</ref> The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 207.</ref> It was the first feature film photographed on [[videotape]] and transferred to [[35 mm film|35&nbsp;mm film]], a process which allowed for novel visual effects.<ref>Starks, 1982, ''Cocaine Fiends and Reefer Madness'', p. 153.</ref> It was released to mixed reviews.<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 94.</ref> The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 119<U+2013>137.</ref>

After ''200 Motels'', the band went on tour, which resulted in two live albums, ''[[Fillmore East - June 1971]]'' and ''[[Just Another Band From L.A.]]''; the latter included the 20-minute track "[[Billy the Mountain]]", Zappa's satire on rock opera set in Southern California. This track was representative of the band's theatrical performances in which songs were used to build up sketches based on ''200 Motels'' scenes as well as new situations often portraying the band members' sexual encounters on the road.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 203<U+2013>204.</ref><ref>During the June 1971 Fillmore concerts Zappa was joined on stage by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]. This performance was recorded, and Lennon released excerpts on his album ''[[Some Time In New York City]]'' in 1972. Zappa later released his version of excerpts from the concert on ''[[Playground Psychotics]]'' in 1992, including the jam track "Scumbag" and an extended avant-garde vocal piece by Ono (originally called "Au"), which Zappa renamed "A Small Eternity with Yoko Ono".</ref>

===1971<U+2013>72: Accident, attack and their aftermath===
{{Listen|filename=Zappa_WakaJawaka.ogg|description=The closing track on ''Waka/Jawaka'', one of Zappa's jazz-oriented albums.|title=Waka/Jawaka|pos=right}}
In December 1971, there were two serious setbacks. While performing at [[Montreux Casino|Casino de Montreux]] in Switzerland, The Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino.<ref name="Rainbow">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 112<U+2013>115.</ref> Immortalized in [[Deep Purple]]'s song "[[Smoke on the Water]]", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album ''Swiss Cheese/Fire'', released legally as part of Zappa's ''[[Beat the Boots II]]'' compilation. After a week's break, The Mothers played at the [[Rainbow (London)|Rainbow Theatre]], London, with rented gear. During the encore, an audience member pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed<U+2014>he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his back, leg, and neck, as well as a crushed [[larynx]], which ultimately caused his voice to drop a [[Major third|third]] after healing.<ref name="Rainbow"/> This accident resulted in him using a wheelchair for an extended period, forcing him off the road for over half a year. Upon his return to the stage in September 1972, he was still wearing a leg brace, had a noticeable limp and could not stand for very long while on stage. Zappa noted that one leg healed "shorter than the other" (a reference later found in the lyrics of songs "Zomby Woof" and "[[Dancin' Fool]]"), resulting in chronic back pain.<ref name="Rainbow"/> Meanwhile, The Mothers were left in limbo and eventually formed the core of Flo and Eddie's band as they set out on their own.

During 1971<U+2013>72 Zappa released two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, ''[[Waka/Jawaka]]'' and ''[[The Grand Wazoo]]'', which were recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni.<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 101.</ref> Musically, the albums were akin to ''Hot Rats''.<ref name="MilesWazoo">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 225<U+2013>226.</ref> Zappa began touring again in late 1972.<ref name="MilesWazoo"/> His first effort was a series of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece [[big band]] referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.<ref>Official recordings of these bands did not emerge until more than 30&nbsp;years later on ''[[Wazoo (album)|Wazoo]]'' (2007) and ''[[Imaginary Diseases]]'' (2006), respectively.</ref>

===1973<U+2013>75: Top 10 album===
Zappa then formed and toured with smaller groups that variously included [[Ian Underwood]] (reeds, keyboards), [[Ruth Underwood]] (vibes, marimba), Sal Marquez (trumpet, vocals), [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] (sax, flute and vocals), [[Bruce Fowler]] (trombone), [[Tom Fowler (musician)|Tom Fowler]] (bass), [[Chester Thompson]] (drums), [[Ralph Humphrey]] (drums), [[George Duke]] (keyboards, vocals), and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (violin).

By 1973 the Bizarre and Straight labels were discontinued. In their place, Zappa and Cohen created [[DiscReet Records]], also distributed by Warner Bros.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 231.</ref> Zappa continued a high rate of production through the first half of the 1970s, including the solo album ''[[Apostrophe (album)|Apostrophe (')]]'' (1974), which reached a career-high No.&nbsp;10 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] pop album charts<ref>{{citation | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p74796|pure_url=yes}} | title= Frank Zappa > Charts and Awards > Billboard Albums | work=AllMusic}}.

===1976<U+2013>79: Business breakups and touring===
[[Image:Frank Zappa - Capt. Beefheart - crop.jpg|thumb|Zappa with [[Captain Beefheart]], seated left, during a 1975 concert]]
Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 250.</ref> Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' (1976) directly to [[Warner Bros.]], thereby bypassing DiscReet.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 253; pp. 258<U+2013>259.</ref>

In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for ''[[L<U+00E4>ther]]'' (pronounced "leather"), a four-LP project. ''L<U+00E4>ther'' encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles<U+2014>rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it.<ref>Lowe, 2006, ''The Words and Music of Frank Zappa'', p. 131.</ref> Zappa managed to get an agreement with [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]], and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material.<ref name="miles261">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 261.</ref> Zappa responded by appearing on the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], California radio station [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], allowing them to broadcast ''L<U+00E4>ther'' and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings.<ref>Slaven, 2003, ''Electric Don Quixote'', p. 248.</ref> A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the ''L<U+00E4>ther'' material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full length LPs) with limited [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]].<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 267.</ref> When the music was first released on CD in 1991, Zappa chose to rerelease the four existing albums. ''L<U+00E4>ther'' was released posthumously in 1996.<ref>It remains debated whether Zappa had conceived the material as a four-LP set from the beginning, or only when approaching Mercury-Phonogram; see, e.g., Watson, 2005, ''Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music'', p. 49. In the liner notes to the 1996 release, however, Gail Zappa states that "As originally conceived by Frank, ''L<U+00E4>ther'' was always a 4-record box set."</ref>

Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts,<ref>Watson, 2005, ''Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music'', p. 49.</ref> the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975<U+2013>77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.<ref name="miles261"/> Drummer [[Terry Bozzio]] became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and original Mothers of Invention bassist [[Roy Estrada]] joined. Among other musicians were bassist [[Patrick O'Hearn]], singer-guitarist [[Ray White]] and keyboardist [[Eddie Jobson]]. In December 1976, Zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the [[NBC]] television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 262.</ref><ref>In 1978, Zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches.</ref> The performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member [[John Belushi]] during the instrumental piece "The Purple Lagoon". Belushi appeared as his Samurai Futaba character playing the tenor sax with Zappa conducting.<ref>Zappa, Frank, 1978, ''Zappa in New York'', Liner Notes.</ref> Zappa's song, "[[I'm the Slime]]", was performed with a voice-over by ''SNL'' booth announcer [[Don Pardo]], who also introduced "Peaches En Regalia" on the same airing.

===From hit single to classical performances===
In May 1982, Zappa released ''[[Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch]]'', which featured his biggest selling single ever, the [[Grammy Award]]-nominated song "[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]" (topping out at No.&nbsp;32 on the ''Billboard'' charts).<ref name="BBsingles" /> In her improvised lyrics to the song, Zappa's daughter [[Moon Zappa|Moon Unit]] satirized the vapid speech of teenage girls from the [[San Fernando Valley]], which popularized many "[[Valspeak]]" expressions such as "gag me with a spoon," "fer sure, fer sure," "grody" (gross), and "barf out".<ref>{{citation | url= {{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2677879|pure_url=yes}} | title = Valley Girl.

In 1983, two different projects were released, beginning with ''[[The Man from Utopia]],'' a rock-oriented work. The album is eclectic, featuring the vocal-led "Dangerous Kitchen" and "The Jazz Discharge Party Hats", both continuations of the sprechstimme excursions on ''Tinseltown Rebellion.'' The second album, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 1]]'', contained orchestral Zappa compositions conducted by [[Kent Nagano]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO). A second record of these sessions, ''[[London Symphony Orchestra, Vol. 2]]'' was released in 1987. The material was recorded under a tight schedule with Zappa providing all funding, helped by the commercial success of "Valley Girl".<ref name="ZappaLSO">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 146<U+2013>156.</ref> Zappa was not satisfied with the LSO recordings.

For the remainder of his career, much of Zappa's work was influenced by his use of the [[Synclavier]] as a compositional and performance tool. Even considering the complexity of the music he wrote, the Synclavier could realize anything he could dream up.<ref name="ZappaSynclavier">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 172<U+2013>173.</ref> The Synclavier could be programmed to play almost anything conceivable, to perfection: "With the Synclavier, any group of imaginary instruments can be invited to play the most difficult passages&nbsp;... with ''one-millisecond'' accuracy<U+2014>every time".<ref name="ZappaSynclavier"/> Even though it essentially did away with the need for musicians,<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 319.</ref> Zappa viewed the Synclavier and real-life musicians as separate.<ref name="ZappaSynclavier"/> In 1984, he released four albums. ''[[Boulez Conducts Zappa: The Perfect Stranger]],'' contains orchestral works commissioned and conducted by world-renowned conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] (who was listed as an influence on ''Freak Out!'') and performed by his [[Ensemble InterContemporain]], juxtaposed with premiere Synclavier pieces. Again, Zappa was not satisfied with the performances of his orchestral works as he found them under-rehearsed, but in the album liner notes he respectfully thanks Boulez's demands for precision.<ref>Watson, 2005, ''Frank Zappa. The Complete Guide to His Music'', p. 73.</ref> The Synclavier pieces stood in contrast to the orchestral works, as the sounds were electronically generated and not, as became possible shortly thereafter, [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].

The album ''[[Thing-Fish]]'' was an ambitious three-record set in the style of a Broadway play dealing with a [[dystopia]]n "what-if" scenario involving feminism, homosexuality, manufacturing and distribution of the AIDS virus, and a [[eugenics]] program conducted by the United States government.<ref>The musical was eventually produced for the stage in 2003.

===Digital medium and last tour===
Around 1986, Zappa undertook a comprehensive re-release program of his earlier vinyl recordings.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 340.</ref> He personally oversaw the remastering of all his 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s albums for the new digital compact disc medium.<ref>For a comprehensive comparison of vinyl of CD releases, see {{citation | url = http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/index.html | title = The Frank Zappa Album Versions Guide&nbsp;<U+2013> Index | series=The Zappa Patio | publisher=lukpac.org/~handmade/patio}}.

See Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 327.</ref> Nearly twenty years before the advent of online music stores, Zappa had proposed to replace "phonographic record merchandising" of music by "direct digital-to-digital transfer" through phone or cable TV (with royalty payments and consumer billing automatically built into the accompanying software).<ref name="DigitalTransfer">Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', pp. 337<U+2013>339.</ref> In 1989, Zappa considered his idea a "miserable flop".<ref name="DigitalTransfer"/>

The album ''[[Jazz from Hell]],'' released in 1986, earned Zappa his first [[Grammy Award]] in 1987 for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]]. Except for one live guitar solo ("St. Etienne"), the album exclusively featured compositions brought to life by the Synclavier. Although an [[instrumental]] album, containing no lyrics whatsoever, Meyer Music Markets sold ''Jazz from Hell'' featuring an "explicit lyrics" sticker<U+2014>a warning label introduced by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in an agreement with the PMRC.<ref>{{citation|last=Nuzum|first=Eric|year=2001|title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-688-16772-1|pages=39, 255}}</ref>

Zappa's last tour in a rock and jazz band format took place in 1988 with a 12-piece group which had a repertoire of over 100 (mostly Zappa) compositions, but which split under acrimonious circumstances before the tour was completed.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 346<U+2013>350.</ref> The tour was documented on the albums ''[[Broadway the Hard Way]]'' (new material featuring songs with strong political emphasis), ''[[The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life]]'' (Zappa "standards" and an eclectic collection of cover tunes, ranging from [[Maurice Ravel]]'s ''[[Bol<U+00E9>ro]]'' to [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]") and ''[[Make a Jazz Noise Here]]''.

In 1990, Frank Zappa was diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]]. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered inoperable.<ref name="Pulse1993"/> After his diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and [[Synclavier]] works. Shortly before his death in 1993 he completed ''[[Civilization, Phaze III]]'', a major Synclavier work which he had begun in the 1980s.<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', pp. 374<U+2013>375.</ref><ref>It brought him a posthumous [[Grammy Award]] (with Gail Zappa) for [[Grammy Award for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package|Best Recording Package&nbsp;<U+2013> Boxed]] in 1994. {{citation | url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search | title= GRAMMY Winners | publisher=National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences}}.

At the first concert, he conducted the opening "Overture", and the final "G-Spot Tornado" as well as the theatrical "Food Gathering in Post-Industrial America, 1992" and "Welcome to the United States" (the remainder of the program was conducted by the ensemble's regular conductor [[Peter Rundel]]). Zappa received a 20-minute ovation.<ref name="MilesEM">Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 371.</ref> It would become his last professional public appearance, as the cancer was spreading to such an extent that he was in too much pain to enjoy an event that he otherwise found "exhilarating".<ref name="MilesEM"/> Recordings from the concerts appeared on ''[[The Yellow Shark]]'' (1993), Zappa's last release during his lifetime, and some material from studio rehearsals appeared on the posthumous ''[[Everything Is Healing Nicely]]'' (1999).

Frank Zappa died on Saturday, December 4, 1993 in his home with his wife and children by his side.

[[File:Frank Zappa at PMRC Senate Hearing 2.ogv|thumb|Testimony continued]]
On September 19, 1985, Zappa testified before the [[United States Senate]] Commerce, Technology, and Transportation committee, attacking the Parents Music Resource Center or [[PMRC]], a music organization co-founded by [[Tipper Gore]], wife of then-senator [[Al Gore]]. The PMRC consisted of many wives of politicians, including the wives of five members of the committee, and was founded to address the issue of song lyrics with sexual or satanic content.<ref>Day, 2000, ''Censorship'', p. 53.</ref> Zappa saw their activities as on a path towards censorship,<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 267.</ref> and called their proposal for voluntary [[Parental Advisory|labelling of records]] with explicit content "extortion" of the music industry.<ref>Zappa with Occhiogrosso, 1989, ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', p. 262.</ref> In his prepared statement, he said:

<blockquote>The PMRC proposal is an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties of people who are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative. In this context, the PMRC's demands are the equivalent of treating [[dandruff]] by [[decapitation]]&nbsp;... The establishment of a rating system, voluntary or otherwise, opens the door to an endless parade of moral quality control programs based on things certain Christians do not like. What if the next bunch of Washington wives demands a [[Yellow badge|large yellow "J"]] on all material written or performed by Jews, in order to save helpless children from exposure to concealed Zionist doctrine?<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/p51.html| title = Record Labeling.

Zappa set excerpts from the PMRC hearings to Synclavier music in his composition "Porn Wars" on the 1985 album ''[[Frank Zappa Meets the Mothers of Prevention]]'', and the full recording was released in 2010 as ''[[Congress Shall Make No Law...]]''. Zappa is heard interacting with Senators [[Fritz Hollings]], [[Slade Gorton]], [[Al Gore]] (who claimed, at the hearing, to be a Zappa fan), and in an exchange with Florida Senator [[Paula Hawkins]] over what toys Zappa's children played with.

===Acclaim and honors===
{{quote box|quote=Frank Zappa was one of the first to try tearing down the barriers between rock, jazz, and classical music. In the late Sixties his Mothers of Invention would slip from Stravinsky's "Petroushka" into The Dovells' "Bristol Stomp" before breaking down into saxophone squeals inspired by Albert Ayler|source=''The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll''<!-- found on p. 497 -->|width=365px}}

Zappa earned widespread critical acclaim in his lifetime and after his death. ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' (2004) writes: "Frank Zappa dabbled in virtually all kinds of music<U+2014>and, whether guised as a satirical rocker, jazz-rock fusionist, guitar virtuoso, electronics wizard, or orchestral innovator, his eccentric genius was undeniable."<ref>{{citation | editor-last=Brackett | editor-first=Nathan | editor2-last =Hoard | editor2-first=Christian | title= The New Rolling Stone Album Guide: Completely Revised and Updated 4th Edition |year=2004|place=New York, NY|publisher=Fireside| page = 903 | isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref> Even though his work drew inspiration from many different genres, Zappa was seen establishing a coherent and personal expression. In 1971, biographer David Walley noted that "The whole structure of his music is unified, not neatly divided by dates or time sequences and it is all building into a composite".<ref>Walley, 1980, ''No Commercial Potential'', p. 3.</ref> On commenting on Zappa's music, politics and philosophy, [[Barry Miles]] noted in 2004 that they cannot be separated: "It was all one; all part of his 'conceptual continuity'."<ref>Miles, 2004, ''Frank Zappa'', p. 383.</ref>
