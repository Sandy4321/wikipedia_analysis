'''Simone Veil''', [[Order of the British Empire|DBE]] ({{IPA-fr|sim<U+0254>n v<U+025B>j}}; born 13 July 1927) is a French lawyer and politician who served as [[Minister of Health (France)|Minister of Health]] under [[Val<U+00E9>ry Giscard d'Estaing]], [[President of the European Parliament]] and member of the [[Constitutional Council of France]].

A survivor from the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp]] where she lost part of her family, she is the Honorary President of the [[Fondation pour la M<U+00E9>moire de la Shoah]].<ref name="Simone Veil">{{cite web|title=Simone Veil|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/veil-simone|website=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> She was elected to the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]] in November 2008.

==Early years==
Veil was born '''Simone Annie Liline Jacob''', the daughter of a Jewish architect in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France.<ref name="Simone Veil"/> In March 1944, Veil's family was deported, Simone, her mother and one sister, Milou, to [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] then [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] where her mother Yvonne died shortly before the camp's 15 April 1945 liberation. Veil's father and brother also died; they are last known to have been sent on a transport to Lithuania.<ref name="Simone Veil"/> Veil's other sister, Denise, who had been arrested as a member of the Resistance survived her imprisonment in [[Ravensbr<U+00FC>ck concentration camp|Ravensbr<U+00FC>ck]]. Milou died in a car crash in the 1950s. Veil returned to speak at Auschwitz-Birkenau in 2005 for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the camps.<ref name="Amba France">{{cite web|title=Simone Veil|url=http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Politics-Simone-Veil|website=France in the United Kingdom|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref>

Having obtained her [[baccalaur<U+00E9>at]] in 1943 before being deported, she began the study of law and political science at [[Institut d'<U+00E9>tudes politiques de Paris|Sciences Po]] and at the University of Paris, where she met her future husband Antoine Veil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Une vie (Simone VEIL)|url=http://www.politique.net/une-vie.htm|website=Politique|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> The couple married on 26 October 1946, and have three sons, Jean, Nicolas, and Pierre Francois. Antoine Veil died on 12 April 2013, at the age of 86 after 66 years of marriage.<ref name="Mort d'Antoine">{{cite web|title=Mort d'Antoine Veil, mari de Simone Veil|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2013/04/12/mort-d-antoine-veil-mari-de-simone-veil_3158784_3382.html|website=Le Monde|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref>

Veil became an attorney and worked for several years as a civil servant in the Ministry of Justice.

==Political career==
[[File:Simone Veil02b.jpg|thumb|left|130px|31 May 1988]]

===Ministry of Justice===

Having graduated from the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris with a law degree, she renounced her career as a lawyer, and in 1956, successfully passed the national examination to become a magistrate.<ref name="Simone Veil"/> Veil then entered and held a senior position at the National Penitentiary Administration under the [[Ministry of Justice]] where she was responsible for judicial affairs and improved women's prison conditions and treatment of incarcerated women.<ref name="histoireparlesfemmes.wordpress.com">{{cite web|title=Simone Veil, d<U+00E9>fenseure de l<U+2019>avortement|url=http://histoireparlesfemmes.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/simone-veil-defenseure-de-lavortement/|website=L'histoire par les femmes|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> She abandoned this post in 1964 to become director of [[civil affairs]] during which she improved French women's general rights and status.<ref name="Simone Veil"/> She successfully achieved the right to dual parental control of family legal matters and adoptive rights for women.<ref name="Simone Veil"/> In 1970, she became secretary general of the Supreme Council of the Magistracy ([[Conseil sup<U+00E9>rieur de la magistrature]]).<ref name="histoireparlesfemmes.wordpress.com"/>

===Minister of Health===
From 1974 to 1979 she was [[Minister of Health (France)|Minister of Health]] in the governments of [[Prime minister of France|prime minister]]s [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Raymond Barre]]. She pushed forward the following notable laws:
* Making access to [[contraception]] easier (4 December 1974) <U+2013> the sale of [[birth control|contraceptives]] such as the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]] had been made legal in 1967.
* Legalizing abortion (17 January 1975), her hardest political fight, and the one for which she is best known. The abortion debate was a particularly difficult time as those opposed to the law launched personal and aggressive attacks against Veil and her family.<ref name="Simone Veil"/> However, since the passing of the law, many have paid tribute to Veil and thanked her for her courageous and determined fight.<ref name="Simone Veil"/>

===European Parliament===
Veil was elected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] in the [[European Parliament election, 1979|1979 European election]]. In its first session, the new Parliament elected Veil as [[President of the European Parliament|its President]], which she served as until 1982.<ref name="EP profile"/>
As well as being the first president of the elected Parliament, she was the first female President since the Parliament was created in 1952. In 1981, Veil won the prestigious [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Prize]].<ref name="Trade Arabia">{{cite web|title=Bahrain business pioneer Veil mourned|url=http://ftp.tradearabia.com/news/MISC_234083.html|website=Trade Arabia|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> She was re-elected in the [[European Parliament election, 1984|1984 election]] and became the leader of the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (European Parliament group)|Liberal Democrat group]] until 1989. She was re-elected for the last time in the [[European Parliament election,and in 1989|1989 election]], standing down in 1993.<ref name="EP profile">[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/archive/term1/view.do?id=1174], [[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament website]]</ref>

Between 1984 and 1992 she served on the [[Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety]], and the Committee on Political Affairs. After standing down from these committees she served on the [[Committee on Foreign Affairs (EU)|Committee on Foreign Affairs]] and its related [[Subcommittee on Human Rights]]. Between 1989 and 1993 she was also a member of Parliament's delegation to the [[ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly]], serving as its vice-chairwoman until 1992.<ref name="EP profile"/>

===Return to French Government===
From 1993 to 1995 Veil was again a member of the cabinet, serving as Minister of State and Minister of Health, Social Affairs and the City in the government of Prime Minister [[<U+00C9>douard Balladur]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Simone Veil|url=http://flyingovereurope.hetcollegevos.nl/content/0607_01/coudekerque/Simone%20Veil/index.htm|website=Flying over Europe|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref>

===Member of the Constitutional Council===
In 1998, she was appointed to the [[Constitutional Council of France]]. In 2005, she put herself briefly on leave from the Council in order to campaign in favour of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]]. This action was criticized, because it seems to contradict the legal provisions that members of the council should keep a distance from partisan politics: the independence and impartiality of the council would be jeopardized, critics said, if members can put themselves "on leave" in order to campaign for such or such project.<ref name="lci.tf1.fr">{{cite web|title=R<U+00E9>f<U+00E9>rendum : Simone Veil r<U+00E9>pond <U+00E0> Debr<U+00E9>|url=http://lci.tf1.fr/france/2005-05/referendum-simone-veil-repond-debre-4860219.html?xtmc=simone%20veil%20debr%C3%A9&xtcr=6|website=My TF1 News|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> In response to this opposition, Veil challenged the attacks claiming that she, the President of the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] and colleagues had deliberated on the issue beforehand and they had given her permission to take her leave without having to resign. Being a staunch supporter of the European project, she believed others should not "ignore the historical dimension of [[European integration]]".<ref name="lci.tf1.fr"/>

===Honors and other activities===
In 1998, she was awarded an [[honorary damehood]] by the [[British government]].<ref name="A life">{{cite book|last1=Veil|first1=Simone|title=A life|date=01/02/2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref>

Accessed 1 August 2007.</ref>

In 2005 she was awarded with the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] in International Cooperation.

In 2007, she was awarded the [[North-South Prize]] of the [[Council of Europe]].

In 2007, Veil surprised many observers by declaring her support for the neo-conservative presidential candidate [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. She was by his side on the day after he received 31 percent of the vote in the first round of the presidential elections that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=ARCHIVES Simone Veil rejoint Nicolas Sarkozy|url=http://lci.tf1.fr/politique/2007-03/simone-veil-rejoint-nicolas-sarkozy-4884489.html|website=My TF1 News|accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref>
