'''Margaret Higgins Sanger''' (September 14, 1879&nbsp;<U+2013> September 6, 1966) was an American [[Sex education|sex educator]], [[nurse]], and [[birth control]] activist.   Sanger coined the term ''birth control'', opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, and established [[Planned Parenthood]].   Sanger's efforts contributed to [[Griswold v. Connecticut|the landmark US Supreme Court case]] which legalized contraception in the United States.  Sanger is a frequent target of attacks by the [[pro-life movement]], based primarily upon Sanger's racial views and support of eugenics,  but she remains an iconic figure for the American [[reproductive rights]] movement.

Her early years were spent in New York City, where she associated with social activists such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Emma Goldman]].  In 1914, prompted by suffering she witnessed due to frequent pregnancies and self-induced abortions, she started publishing a monthly newsletter, ''The Woman Rebel''. Sanger's activism was influenced by the conditions of her youth <U+2014> her mother went through 18 pregnancies in 22 years, and died at age 45 of tuberculosis and cervical cancer.

In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, which led to her arrest for distributing information on [[contraception]].  Her subsequent trial and appeal generated enormous support for her cause.  Sanger felt that in order for women to have a more equal footing in society and to lead healthier lives, they needed to be able to determine when to bear children.  She also wanted to prevent [[abortion]]s, which were dangerous and usually illegal at that time.

In 1921, Sanger founded the [[American Birth Control League]], which later became the [[Planned Parenthood Federation of America]].   In New York, Sanger organized the first birth control clinic staffed by all-female doctors, as well as a clinic in [[Harlem]] with an entirely African-American staff.   In 1929, she formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control, which served as the focal point of her lobbying efforts to legalize contraception in the United States.   From 1952 to 1959, Sanger served as president of the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]].   She died in 1966, and is widely regarded as a founder of the modern birth control movement.

Margaret Sanger was born as Margaret Higgins in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]]. Her mother, Anne Purcell Higgins, was a devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] who went through 18 pregnancies (with 11 live births) in 22 years<ref>Cox, p 4;  {{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988152,00.html |title=Time's 100 Most Important People of the Century: Margaret Sanger |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |last=Steinem |first=Gloria |authorlink=Gloria Steinem |date=1998-04-13}}</ref> before dying at age 45 of [[tuberculosis]] and [[cervical cancer]].<ref>Buchanan, p 121</ref> Margaret's father, Michael Hennessy Higgins, was an atheist and an activist for women's suffrage and free public education.<ref name=father>Rosalind Rosenberg, ''Divided lives: American women in the twentieth century'', p 82; Sanger, ''Autobiography'', p 13.</ref>  Sanger was the sixth of eleven children,<ref>{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=James L. |last2=Cooper |first2= Sheila M. |title=The Roots of American Feminist Thought |publisher=Alvin and Bacon |year=1973 |page=219 |asin=B002VY8L0O  }}</ref> and spent much of her youth assisting with household chores and caring for her younger siblings.

===Social activism===
In 1912, after a fire destroyed their home in [[Hastings-on-Hudson]], the Sanger family moved back to New York City, where Margaret began working as a nurse in the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|East Side]] slums of [[Manhattan]].   Margaret and William became immersed in the radical bohemian culture that was then flourishing in [[Greenwich Village]]<ref name=Chesler>{{Cite book | last=Chesler | first=Ellen |  coauthors= | title=Woman of valor: Margaret Sanger and the birth control movement in America | year=1992 | publisher=Simon Schuster | location=New York | isbn=0-671-60088-5 | pages=}}</ref> and became involved with local intellectuals, artists, and activists, including [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Mabel Dodge]], and Emma Goldman.<ref name=Chesler/>   Starting in 1911 she started writing a series of articles about sexual hygiene  entitled "What Every Mother Should Know" and "What Every Girl Should Know" for the [[socialist]] magazine ''[[New York Call]]''.{{#tag:ref|Sanger wrote two series of articles for the ''New York Call'':  "What Every Mother Should Know" (1911<U+2013>1912) and "What Every Girl Should Know'" (1912<U+2013>1913).

In 1913, Sanger worked as a nurse in New York's [[Lower East Side]], often with poor women who were suffering due to frequent childbirth and self-induced abortions.  Searching for something that would help these women, Sanger visited public libraries, but was unable to find information on contraception.<ref>Endres, Kathleen L., ''Women's periodicals in the United States: social and political issues'', p 448; Endres cites Sanger, ''An Autobiography'', pp 95<U+2013>96.  Endres cites Kennedy, p 19, as pointing out that some materials on birth control were available in 1913.</ref>  These problems were epitomized in a story that Sanger would later recount in her speeches:  while Sanger was working as a nurse, she was called to Sadie Sachs' apartment after Sachs had become extremely ill due to a self-induced abortion. Afterward, Sadie begged the attending doctor to tell her how she could prevent this from happening again, to which the doctor simply gave the advice to remain abstinent.  A few months later, Sanger was once again called back to the Sachs' apartment <U+2014> only this time, Sadie was found dead after yet another self-induced abortion.<ref>Lader (1955), pp 44<U+2013>50

Although Sadie Sachs was possibly a fictional composite of several women Sanger had known or encountered, this story marks the time when Sanger began to devote her life to help desperate women before they were driven to pursue dangerous and illegal abortions.<ref name=KVPsych/><ref>Composite story:  ''The selected papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1'', p 185.

===Birth control movement===
[[File:1917 Edition of Family Limitations.jpg|thumb|right|160px|This page from Sanger's ''Family Limitation'', 1917 edition, describes a  [[cervical cap]].]]
Europe had a much more liberal view of contraception than the United States, and when Sanger visited a Dutch birth control clinic in 1915, she learned about  [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s and became convinced that they were a more effective means of contraception than the suppositories and [[douche]]s that she had been distributing back in the United States.<ref name=Chesler/>  Diaphragms were generally unavailable in the US, and so Sanger and others began importing them from Europe, in defiance of US law.<ref name=Chesler/>

In 1916, Sanger published ''What Every Girl Should Know'', which provided information about such topics as [[menstruation]] and sexuality in adolescents.  In 1917, she started publishing the monthly periodical ''The Birth Control Review.''<ref group="note">The first issue of ''Birth Control Review'' was published Feb 1917</ref>

On October 16, 1916, Sanger opened a family planning and birth control clinic at 46 Amboy St. in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville neighborhood]] of [[Brooklyn]], the first of its kind in the United States.<ref>''Selected Papers, vol 1'', p 199
<br/>Baker, p 115</ref>  Nine days after the clinic opened, Sanger was arrested for breaking a New York state law that prohibited distribution of contraceptives, and went to trial in January 1917.<ref>Engelman, p 101</ref>  She was convicted, and the judge offered a more lenient sentence if she promised to not break the law again, but Sanger replied "I cannot respect the law as it exists today."<ref name="Cox">Cox, p 65</ref>  She was sentenced to 30 days in a workhouse.<ref name="Cox" />  An initial appeal was rejected, but in a subsequent court proceeding in 1918, the birth control movement won a victory when Judge [[Frederick E. Crane]] of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] issued a ruling which allowed doctors to prescribe contraception.<ref>Engelman, pp 101<U+2013>3</ref>   The publicity surrounding Sanger's arrest, trial, and appeal sparked birth control activism across the United States, and earned the support of numerous donors who would provide her with funding and support for future endeavors.<ref>McCann 2010, p 751</ref>

Sanger became estranged from her husband in 1913, and the couple's divorce was finalized in 1921.<ref>Cox, p 76</ref>   She had been involved in relationships with [[Havelock Ellis]] and [[H. G. Wells]] during this period of estrangement.<ref>Chesler, pp 182, 186</ref> In 1922, Sanger married oil magnate Noah Slee, and she remained married to him until he died in 1943.  Slee's fortune helped fund Sanger's activism.<ref>Cohen, p 64</ref>

===American Birth Control League===
[[File:Birth Control Review 1919.jpg|thumb |left|upright|Sanger published the ''Birth Control Review'' from 1917 to 1929.<ref group="note">Caption at the bottom of this 1919 issue reads: "Must She Always Plead in Vain? 'You are a nurse <U+2013> can you tell me? For the children's sake <U+2013> help me!'"</ref>]]

After [[WW I]], Sanger shifted away from radical politics, and she founded the [[American Birth Control League]] (ABCL) in 1921 to enlarge her base of supporters to include the middle class.<ref>Freedman, Estelle B., ''The essential feminist reader'', Random House Digital, Inc., 2007   p 211.</ref>  The founding principles of the ABCL were as follows:<ref>"Birth control: What it is, How it works, What it will do", ''The Proceedings of the First American Birth Control Conference'', Nov 11,12 1921, pp 207<U+2013>8

<br/>These principles were adopted at the first meeting of the ABCL in late 1921
</ref>

<blockquote>We hold that children should be (1) Conceived in love; (2) Born of the mother's conscious desire; (3) And only begotten under conditions which render possible the heritage of health.  Therefore we hold that every woman must possess the power and freedom to prevent conception except when these conditions can be satisfied.</blockquote>

After Sanger discovered that physicians were exempt from the law that prohibited the distribution of contraceptive information to women{{mdash}}provided it was prescribed for medical reasons<ref name=Chesler/>{{mdash}}she established  the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB) in 1923 to exploit this loophole.<ref>Baker, p 196</ref>    The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the US, and it was staffed entirely by female doctors and social workers.<ref>Baker, pp 196<U+2013>197
<br/>''The Selected Papers, Vol 2'', p 54
</ref> The clinic received funding from  the [[Rockefeller family]], which continued to make donations to Sanger's causes in future decades, but generally made them anonymously to avoid public exposure of the family name.<ref name="Rockefeller">Chesler, pp 277, 293, 558

In 1922, she traveled to China, Korea, and  Japan.  In China she observed that the primary method of family planning was female infanticide, and she later worked with [[Pearl Buck]] to establish a family planning clinic in Shanghai.<ref>Cohen, pp 64<U+2013>5</ref>   Sanger visited Japan six times, working with  Japanese feminist [[Kato Shidzue]] to promote birth control.<ref>Baker, p 275

In 1926, Sanger gave a lecture on birth control to the [[WKKK|women's auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan]] in Silver Lake, [[New Jersey]].<ref name = wkkk/> She described it as "one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing," and added that she had to use only "the most elementary terms, as though I were trying to make children understand."<ref name = wkkk/> Sanger's talk was well-received by the group, and as a result, "a dozen invitations to similar groups were proffered."<ref name=wkkk>{{cite book |author=Sanger, Margaret |year=1938 |title=Margaret Sanger, An Autobiography |location=New York |publisher=W.

In 1928, conflict within the birth control movement leadership led Sanger to resign as the president of the ABCL and take full control of the CRB, renaming it the Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau (BCCRB), marking the beginning of a schism in the movement that would last until 1938.<ref>McCann  (1994), pp 177<U+2013>8

Sanger invested a great deal of effort communicating with the general public.  From 1916 onward, she frequently lectured{{mdash}}in churches, women's clubs, homes, and theaters{{mdash}}to workers, churchmen, liberals, socialists, scientists, and upper-class women.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Autobiography of Margaret Sanger |last= Sanger |first= Margaret |year= 2004 |publisher= Courier Dover Publications |location= |isbn= 0486434923 |page= 366 }}</ref>  She wrote several  books in the 1920s which had a nationwide impact in promoting the cause of birth control.  Between 1920 and 1926, 567,000 copies of ''Woman and the New Race'' and ''The Pivot of Civilization'' were sold.<ref>Baker p 161
<br/>Cohen, p 63</ref>    During the 1920s, Sanger received hundreds of thousands of letters, many of them written in desperation by women begging for information on how to prevent unwanted pregnancies.<ref>{{cite news|title="Motherhood in Bondage," #6, Winter 1993/4|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/motherhood_in_bondage.html|accessdate=April 9, 2011|newspaper=Margaret Sanger Papers Project}}
<br/>The number of letters is reported as "a quarter million", "over a million", or "hundreds of thousands" in various sources

===Planned Parenthood era===
In 1929, Sanger formed the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control in order to lobby for legislation to overturn restrictions on contraception.<ref>NYU Margaret Sanger Papers Project [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/aboutms/organization_ncflbc.html "National Committee on Federal Legislation on Birth Control"]</ref> That effort failed to achieve success, so Sanger ordered a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] from Japan in 1932, in order to provoke a decisive battle in the courts.  The diaphragm was confiscated by the US government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to [[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries|a 1936 court decision]] which overturned an important provision of the Comstock laws which prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.<ref>Rose, Melody, ''Abortion: a documentary and reference guide'', ABC-CLIO, 2008, p 29</ref>   This court victory motivated the [[American Medical Association]] in 1937 to adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a key  component of medical school curriculums.<ref name="bare_url">[http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html "Biographical Note", Smith College, Margaret Sangers Papers]</ref>
[[File:17-23 West 16th St.jpg|thumb|right|Sanger's Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau operated from [[Margaret Sanger Clinic|this New York building]] from 1930 to 1973.]]

This 1936 contraception court victory was the culmination of Sanger's birth control efforts, and she took the opportunity, now in her late 50s, to move to Tucson, Arizona, intending to play a less critical role in the birth control movement.  In spite of her original intentions, she remained active in the movement through the 1950s.<ref name="bare_url" />

In 1937, Sanger became chairman of the newly formed Birth Control Council of America, and attempted to resolve the schism between the ABCL and the BCCRB.<ref>NYU Margaret Sanger Papers Project [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/aboutms/organization_bcca.html "Birth Control Council of America" ]</ref>  Her efforts were successful, and the two organizations merged in 1939 as the Birth Control Federation of America.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/aboutms/organization_ppfa.html |title=MSPP &#62; About &#62; Birth Control Organizations &#62; PPFA |author=The Margaret Sanger Papers |work=nyu.edu |year=2010 [last update] |accessdate=17 October 2011}}</ref><ref group="note">Date of merger recorded as 1938 (not 1939) in: O'Conner, Karen, ''Gender and Women's Leadership: A Reference Handbook'', p 743.

In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]] in 1952, and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international family planning organization.  Sanger was the organization's first president and served in that role until she was 80 years old.<ref>Ford, Lynne E., ''Encyclopedia of women and American politics'', p 406

===Legacy===
Sanger died of [[congestive heart failure]] in 1966 in [[Tucson, Arizona]], at the age of 86, about a year after the event that marked the climax of her 50-year career: the landmark [[US Supreme Court]] case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'', which legalized birth control in the US.<ref group="note"> In 1965, the case had struck down one of the remaining contraception-related Comstock laws in Connecticut and Massachusetts. However, Griswold only applied to marital relationships. A later case,[[Eisenstadt v. Baird]] (1972), extended the ''Griswold'' holding to unmarried persons as well.

Long after her death, Sanger has continued to be regarded as a leading figure in the battle for American women's rights.  Sanger's story has been the subject several biographies, including an award-winning biography published in 1970 by [[David M. Kennedy (historian)|David Kennedy]], and is also the subject of several films, including ''[[Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story]].''<ref>''Choices of the Heart''  <U+2013>  1995, starring [[Dana Delany]] and [[Henry Czerny]], {{cite web|title= 'Choices of the Heart: The Margaret Sanger Story (1995)' |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112664/ |accessdate=2009-07-29 |date=1995-03-08 |publisher=IMDb (The Internet Movie Database)}}

Sanger has been recognized with many important honors.  In 1957, the [[American Humanist Association]] named her Humanist of the Year.   Government authorities and other institutions have memorialized Sanger by dedicating several landmarks in her name, including a residential building on the [[Stony Brook University]] campus, a room in Wellesley College's library,<ref>[http://www.wellesley.edu/Library/Fr-news/16Spring2003/friends16.html Friends of the Library Newsletter]</ref> and Margaret Sanger Square in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Radical Walking Tours of New York City |last=Kayton |first=Bruce |year=2003 |publisher=Seven Stories Press |location=New York |isbn=1583225544 |page=111 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dLu6zRsKRTIC&lpg=PA111&dq=%22Margaret%20Sanger%20Square%22&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q=%22Margaret%20Sanger%20Square%22&f=false |accessdate=2010-12-29 }}</ref>    In 1993, the [[Margaret Sanger Clinic]]{{mdash}}where she provided birth control services in New York in the mid twentieth century{{mdash}}was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2157&ResourceType=Building National Historic Landmark Program]</ref>  In 1966, Planned Parenthood began issuing its [[Margaret Sanger Award]]s annually to honor "individuals of distinction in recognition of excellence and leadership in furthering reproductive health and reproductive rights."<ref>{{cite news|title=Rockefeller 3d Wins Sanger Award|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0615F93D5B117B93CBA9178BD95F438685F9|accessdate=February 14, 2011|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}

The [[right-to-life]] movement frequently condemns Sanger by questioning her fitness as a mother and criticizing her views on race, abortion, and eugenics.<ref name="Marshall">{{cite book | author = Marshall, Robert G. | coauthors = Donovan, Chuck | title = Blessed Are the Barren: The Social Policy of Planned Parenthood | authorlink = Robert G.

==Views and opinions==
===Sexuality===
<!--
[[File:Havelock Ellis 30yo.JPG|thumb|right|160px|Psychologist [[Havelock Ellis]], a close friend of Sanger, influenced her views of sexuality.]]
-->
While traveling in Europe in 1914, Sanger met [[Havelock Ellis]], a  psychologist who had written extensively on sexuality.<ref>Cox, p 55</ref> Influenced by Ellis, Sanger rejected Freud's view of sexuality, instead adopting Ellis's view that sexuality was a powerful, liberating force.<ref name="Cheslerpp" />   This gave Sanger yet another argument in support of birth control: it would fulfill a critical psychological need by enabling women to fully enjoy sexual relations, free from the fear of an unwanted pregnancy.<ref>Chesler
<br/>Kennedy, p 127</ref> Sanger also believed that sexuality, along with birth control, should be discussed with more candor.<ref name="Cheslerpp">Chesler, pp 13<U+2013>14</ref>

Sanger wrote that masturbation <U+2014> both actual and mere fantasizing <U+2014> was wasteful and harmful.   Sanger believed that women had the ability to control their sexual impulses, and should utilize that control to avoid sex outside of relationships marked by "confidence and respect."  She believed that exercising such control would lead to the "strongest and most sacred passion."<ref>Bronski, Michael, ''A Queer History of the United States'', Beacon Press, 2011
<br/>Quotes from Sanger, "What Every Girl should know: Sexual Impulses Part II",  in ''New York Call'', Dec 29, 1912; also in the subsequent book ''What Every Girl Should Know'' pp 40<U+2013>48;  reprinted in ''The selected papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1'', pp 41<U+2013>5 (quotes on p 45)
</ref>

===Eugenics===
As part of her efforts to promote birth control, Sanger found common cause with proponents of eugenics,  believing that they both sought to "assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit."<ref>Engelman, p 132</ref>    Sanger was a proponent of negative [[eugenics]], a social philosophy which claims that human hereditary traits can be improved through social intervention. Sanger's eugenic policies included an exclusionary immigration policy, free access to birth control methods and full [[family planning]] autonomy for the able-minded, and compulsory segregation or sterilization for the profoundly retarded.<ref name="Porter, Nicole S.; Bothne Nancy; Leonard, Jason 126">{{cite book | title=Public Policy Issues Research Trends | publisher=Nova Science | author=Porter, Nicole S.; Bothne Nancy; Leonard, Jason | pages=126 | editor=Evans, Sophie J.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8FimyKiZOXUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Sanger&f=false | isbn=9781600218736 | date=2008-02-01}}</ref><ref name="HitlerEquation" />
In her book ''The Pivot of Civilization'', she advocated coercion to prevent the "undeniably feeble-minded" from procreating.<ref>Sanger, ''Pivot'', p 181;  quoted in Charles Valenza: "Was Margaret Sanger a Racist?" Family Planning Perspectives, January<U+2013>February 1985, page 44.</ref>  Although Sanger supported negative eugenics, she asserted that eugenics alone was not sufficient, and that birth control was essential to achieve her goals.<ref name="Betterment">Sanger, Margaret, "Birth Control and Racial Betterment", ''Birth Control Review'', Feb. 1919, pp 11<U+2013>12, [http://library.lifedynamics.com/Birth%20Control%20Review/1919-02%20February.pdf Online]</ref><ref name="EugenicLegacy">{{cite book | title=Margaret Sanger's eugenic legacy: the control of female fertility | author=Franks, Angela | year=1971 | pages=49 | isbn=978-0-7864-2011-7}}</ref><ref name="EssentialFeminist">{{cite book | title=The essential feminist reader | publisher=Modern Library | author=Freedman, Estelle B. | year=2007 | pages=211}}</ref>

In contrast with eugenicists who advocated euthanasia for the unfit,<ref group="note">For example, in William Robinson's book, ''Eugenics, Marriage and Birth Control (Practical Eugenics),'' Robinson wrote, 'The best thing would be to gently chloroform these [unfit] children or give them a dose of potassium cyanide.'"</ref> Sanger wrote, "we [do not] believe that the community could or should send to the lethal chamber the defective progeny resulting from irresponsible and unintelligent breeding."<ref>{{cite book | last = Black | first = Edwin | authorlink = Edwin Black | title = The War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race | origyear = 2003 | publisher = Four Walls Eight Windows | location = New York City, NY| isbn = 1-56858-258-7 | year = 2003 | month = September}}, p  251.
<br/>Sanger's quote from ''The Pivot of Civilization'', p 100
</ref>  Similarly, Sanger denounced the agressive and lethal [[Nazi eugenics]] program.<ref name="HitlerEquation"/>  In addition, Sanger believed the responsibility for birth control should remain in the hands of able-minded individual parents rather than the state, and that self-determining motherhood was the only unshakable foundation for racial betterment.<ref name="Betterment"/><ref>Margaret Sanger.

Complementing her eugenics policies, Sanger also supported restrictive immigration policies.  In "A Plan for Peace", a 1932 essay, she proposed a [[United States Congress|congressional]] department to address population problems.  She also recommended that immigration exclude those "whose condition is known to be detrimental to the stamina of the race," and that sterilization and segregation be applied to those with incurable, hereditary disabilities.<ref name="Porter, Nicole S.; Bothne Nancy; Leonard, Jason 126"/><ref name="HitlerEquation">[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.html "The Sanger-Hitler Equation"], ''Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter'', #32, Winter 2002/3.

===Race===
[[File:WEB DuBois 1918.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] served on the board of Sanger's Harlem clinic.<ref>Baker, p 200</ref>]]
Sanger believed that lighter-skinned races were superior to darker-skinned races, but would not tolerate bigotry among her staff, nor any refusal to work within interracial projects.<ref>McCann (1994), pp 150<U+2013>4
<br/>See also p 45, ''The selected papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1''</ref>  Although Sanger's views on race appear archaic from a modern viewpoint, her contemporaries in the African-American community supported her efforts.   In 1929, James H. Hubert, a black social worker and leader of New York's [[Urban League]], asked Sanger to open a clinic in [[Harlem]].<ref>Hajo, p. 85</ref>  Sanger secured funding from the [[Julius Rosenwald Fund]] and opened the clinic,  staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930.  The clinic was directed by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers.  The clinic was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], founder of the [[NAACP]].<ref>Hajo, p. 85
<br/>From Planned Parenthood:  {{cite web |url=http://www.plannedparenthoodnj.org/library/topic/contraception/margaret_sanger |title=The Truth about Margaret Sanger |publisher=Planned Parenthood Federation of America}}:
<blockquote>In 1930, Sanger opened a family planning clinic in Harlem that sought to enlist support for contraceptive use and to bring the benefits of family planning to women who were denied access to their city's health and social services. Staffed by a black physician and black social worker, the clinic was endorsed by ''[[The New York Amsterdam News|The Amsterdam News]]'' (the powerful local newspaper), the [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]], the [[Urban League]], and the black community's elder statesman, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].</blockquote>

From 1939 to 1942 Sanger was an honorary delegate of the Birth Control Federation of America, which included a supervisory role <U+2014> alongside [[Mary Lasker]] and [[Clarence Gamble]] <U+2014> in the Negro Project, an effort to deliver birth control to poor African Americans.<ref>Engelman, p 175

Sanger and the Negro Project |issue=28 |date=2002-11-14 |publisher=Margaret Sanger Papers Project |accessdate=2009-01-25}}
</ref> Sanger wanted the Negro Project to include black ministers in leadership roles, but other supervisors did not.  To emphasize the benefits of involving black community leaders, she wrote to Gamble "we do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."  This quote has been used  by numerous Sanger detractors, including [[Angela Davis]] and the pro-life movement, to support their claims that Sanger was racist.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Margaret Sanger Papers Project Newsletter |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/bc_or_race_control.html |title=Birth Control or Race Control? Sanger and the Negro Project |issue=28 |date=2002-11-14 |publisher=Margaret Sanger Papers Project |accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref>  However, according to New York University's ''Margaret Sanger Papers Project'', Sanger, in writing that letter,  "recognized that elements within the black community might mistakenly associate the Negro Project with racist sterilization campaigns in the [[Jim Crow]] South, unless clergy and other community leaders spread the word that the Project had a humanitarian aim."<ref>"Smear n Fear", New York University, History Department, Margaret Sanger Papers Project, 2010, [http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/sightings/index.html]</ref>

===Freedom of speech===
Sanger supported the cause of free speech throughout her career, with a zeal comparable to her support for birth control.  Sanger grew up in a home where iconoclastic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]] was admired.<ref name="new yorker">"The Child Who Was Mother to a Woman" from ''The New Yorker'', April 11, 1925, page 11.</ref>   During the early years of her activism, Sanger viewed birth control primarily as a free-speech issue, rather than a feminist issue, and when she started publishing ''The Woman Rebel'' in 1914, she did so with the express goal of provoking a legal challenge to the Comstock laws banning dissemination of information about contraception.<ref name="McCann" />   In New York, Emma Goldman introduced  Sanger to members of the Free Speech League, such as [[Edward Bliss Foote]] and [[Theodore Schroeder]], and subsequently the League provided funding and advice to help Sanger with legal battles.<ref>Wood, Janice Ruth (2008), ''The struggle for free speech in the United States, 1872<U+2013>1915: Edward Bliss Foote, Edward Bond Foote, and anti-Comstock operations'', Psychology Press, 2008, pp 100<U+2013>102</ref>

Over the course of her career, Sanger was arrested at least eight times for expressing her views during a era in which speaking publicly about contraception was illegal.<ref>"Every Child a Wanted Child", ''Time'', Sept 16, 1966, p 96.</ref>  Numerous times in her career, local government officials prevented Sanger from speaking by shuttering a facility or threatening her hosts.<ref>Kennedy, p 149</ref>  In Boston in 1929, city officials under the leadership of [[James Michael Curley|James Curley]] threatened to arrest her if she spoke <U+2014> so she turned the threat to her advantage and stood on stage, silent, with a gag over her mouth, while her speech was read by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]]<ref>Melody, Michael Edward (1999), ''Teaching America about sex: marriage guides and sex manuals from the late Victorians to Dr. Ruth'', NYU Press, 1999,  p 53 (citing Halberstam, David, ''The Fifties'', Villard.  1993, p 285)
<br/>Davis, Tom, ''Sacred work: Planned Parenthood and its clergy alliances'' Rutgers University Press, 2005, p 213 (citing ''A Tradition of Choice'', Planned Parenthood, 1991, p 18)
</ref>

===Abortion===
Sanger's family planning advocacy always focused on contraception, rather than abortion.<ref>Baker, p 3</ref>{{#tag:ref|For a discussion of Sanger in relation to abortion see:  Hitchcock, Susan Tyler, ''Roe v. wade: protecting a woman's right to choose''<ref>Infobase Publishing, 2006, pp 29<U+2013>35</ref>|group="note"}}   It was not until the mid 1960s, after Sanger's death, that the reproductive rights movement expanded its scope to include abortion rights as well as contraception.{{#tag:ref| Sanger died in 1966, the same year the [[National Organization for Women]] was founded and reproductive rights advocates started to strongly campaign for legalized abortion rights, which culminated in the 1973 [[Roe v Wade]] supreme court case.<ref>Engelman, pp 181<U+2013>5</ref>|group="note"}}  Sanger was opposed to abortions, both because they were dangerous for the mother, and because she believed that life should not be terminated after conception.   In her book ''Woman and the New Race'', she wrote, "while there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bartleby.com/1013/10.html|title=Woman and the New Race|author=Margaret Sanger|year=1920|chapter=Contraceptives or Abortion?}}</ref>

Historian Rodger Streitmatter concluded that Sanger's opposition to abortion stemmed from concerns for the dangers to the mother, rather than moral concerns.<ref>{{cite book|last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2001|location=New York|page=169|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}</ref> However, in her 1938 autobiography, Sanger noted that her opposition to abortion was based on the taking of life: "[In 1916] we explained what contraception was; that abortion  was the wrong way <U+2014> no matter how early it was performed it was taking life; that contraception was the better way, the safer way <U+2014> it took a little time, a little trouble, but was well worth while in the long run, because life had not yet begun."<ref name=abortion>{{cite book |author=Sanger, Margaret |year=1938 |title=Margaret Sanger, An Autobiography |location=New York |publisher=W. W. Norton |page=217}}</ref>  And in her book ''Family Limitation,'' Sanger wrote that "no one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable but they will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception. This is the only cure for abortions."<ref>Gray, p 280, citing 1916 edition:  {{cite book | url=http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/AmRad/familylimitations.pdf |author=Sanger, Margaret |year=1917 |title=Family Limitation |page=5}}</ref>
