'''Hurricane Ramon''' was a very intense [[Pacific hurricane]] that generated heavy rains in [[Southern California]]. The 19th [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] and final hurricane of the above-average [[1987 Pacific hurricane season]], Ramon originated from a tropical disturbance formed in early October. On October&nbsp;5, a tropical storm had developed several hundred miles southwest of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], bypassing the tropical depression stage. Tropical Storm Ramon turned to the west-northwest after initially moving west. It intensified into a hurricane on October&nbsp;7. Two days later, Hurricane Ramon peaked in intensity with winds of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h). After peaking, Ramon turned to the northwest and rapidly weakened over cooler waters. It weakened into a tropical storm on October&nbsp;11 and a depression on October&nbsp;12. Ramon dissipated shortly thereafter. While at sea, Ramon brought light rainfall to the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. The remnants of Hurricane Ramon produced heavy rainfall that caused flooding in [[California]], indirectly contributing to five traffic-related fatalities. Rainfall was reported as far inland as [[Utah]].

{{Storm path|Ramon 1987 track.png}}
Hurricane Ramon originated from a tropical disturbance that was situated south of a large [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over Central [[Mexico]]. The disturbance became better organized while traversing {{convert|84|F|C|abbr=on}} waters and at 1800&nbsp;[[UTC]] on October&nbsp;5, the [[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center]] (EPHC) upgraded the disturbance into a tropical storm while centered about {{convert|575|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=5}} southwest of [[Acapulco]].<ref name="1987phs">{{cite journal|author=R.L.

Thereafter, Tropical Storm Ramon turned west-northwestward and began to intensity. At 1200&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;7, the EPHC reported that Ramon had intensified into a hurricane. About 24 hours later, the system was upgraded into a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale]] (SSHWS). Rapidly intensifying, Ramon reached major hurricane status on October&nbsp;8 (Category 3 or higher on the SSHWS). At 0600&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;9, Ramon was upgraded into a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane{{EPAC hurricane best track}} while reaching its peak intensity of 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h),<ref name="1987phs"/> which it maintained for 24&nbsp;hours.{{EPAC hurricane best track}}

After attaining peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon began to weaken. Late on October&nbsp;10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2.{{EPAC hurricane best track}} Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate due to a combination of [[jetstream]] interactions and increasingly cold [[sea-surface temperature]]s.<ref name="1987phs"/> At 0600&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;11, the storm was downgraded into a Category&nbsp;1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category&nbsp;2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October&nbsp;12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600&nbsp;UTC that day.{{EPAC hurricane best track}} The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into [[Southern California]], resulting in record rains.<ref name="1987phs"/>
