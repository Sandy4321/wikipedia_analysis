'''John Brandard''' (1812 <U+2013> 15 December 1863) was an English [[Lithography|lithographic artist]]. He designed many hundred illustrated title-pages for [[sheet music]] in what [[Michael Bryan (art historian)|Michael Bryan]] judged "a pretty, though weak, style".

John Brandard was born at [[Birmingham]], the second of three sons born to Thomas Brandard (d. 1830), engraver and copperplate printer, of Barford Street, Deretend, Birmingham, and his wife, Ann. His older brother was [[Robert Brandard]]. John Brandard was baptized on 13 March 1812 at St Martin's church in Birmingham. He began his career as an engraver, mainly of commercial designs. On 17 January 1833 he married Maria Chater at [[Edgbaston]] in Birmingham. They had five children, one of whom, Walter Brandard, was also briefly a designer of [[sheet music]] covers.<ref name=ODNB>Joanna Selborne, <U+2018>Brandard family (per. c.1825<U+2013>1898)<U+2019>, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/64149] accessed 29 March 2012</ref> He worked in a life-long partnership with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] printers M. and N. Hanhart, for whom he produced designs for [[Louis-Antoine Jullien]] from 1844 until 1856, when Jullien was ruined following a fire which destroyed his entire stock of music. 
<blockquote>
"Brandard took the [[chromolithograph]], which had been first used in connection with music in 1841, to an incredibly high level of sophistication, using half a dozen or more stones to produce a single image,  printed on paper of a far higher quality than had been used for this purpose hitherto... The colours red and blue predominate in his palette of the 1840s, along with some exquisitely diaphanous draughtsmanship and plentiful use of gold, especially in filigree borders. This latter was something Brandard may have learned when copying medieval illuminations for the Hanharts<U+2019> bound music albums. His covers convey an illusion of luxury and refinement, and are clearly aimed at the wealthier sections of society..."<ref name=sheet>[http://www.fineartfacts.com/cgi-bin/public_view_workgroup.pl?Type=ViewRecord&WorkgroupNumber=14 Brandard in the 'Philip Ward-Jackson Sheet Music Collection']</ref>
</blockquote>
 
Brandard employed two full-time assistants, allowing him to produce artwork quickly and prolifically, mainly concentrating on ballet and opera. His portraits of dancers were admired by [[Edgar Degas|Degas]]. He usually charged 20 [[guinea]]s for his original artwork and lived well from the proceeds of his art. Described as " an imposing, dandified figure", he would often arrive at theatres in [[Drury Lane]] or [[Covent Garden]] in his own coach and horses.<ref name=ODNB/>
 
John Brandard died at his home 8 Southampton Place in [[Chalk Farm]], London, on 15 December 1863. 

Collections of his work are held at [[Reading University]], at the [[Theatre Museum]] in [[Covent Garden]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[British Library]] at the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford.
