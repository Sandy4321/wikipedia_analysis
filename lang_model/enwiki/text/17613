'''Leland Stanford "Larry" MacPhail, Sr.''' (born [[3 February]] [[1890]] in [[Cass City, Michigan|Cass City]], [[Michigan]] - died [[1 October]] [[1975]] in [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]) was an [[United States|American]] executive and innovator in [[Major League Baseball]]. 

Prior to [[World War I]] MacPhail was an executive of a department store in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] and during [[World War I]], he served as an [[artillery]] [[captain]] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. He accompanied his commander, [[Colonel]] [[Luke Lea]], on an unsanctioned mission to [[Amerongen]] in the [[Netherlands]] in January 1919 to attempt to arrest the exiled German Kaiser, [[Wilhelm II]], and bring him to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to be tried for [[war crimes]].  

During his baseball career he served as the chief executive of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], and the [[New York Yankees]]. MacPhail's innovations include nighttime baseball, regular game televising and the flying of teams between games. 

He was pivotal in the development of pioneering sportscaster [[Red Barber]], who announced Reds and Dodgers games for MacPhail and whom he tried unsuccessfully to recruit to the Yanks when he became the Bronx team's co-owner in 1945. (Barber joined the Yankees crew in 1954, years after MacPhail sold his share in the club.)

MacPhail's career as a major-league owner ended after the Yankees clinched the 1947 [[World Series]], after he got into confrontations at the team's post-game celebrations at [[Yankee Stadium]] and [[Manhattan]]. Though he had already quit as chief executive in the Yankee locker room, books by [[Roger Kahn]] and others indicate MacPhail's behavior at the victory parties led to co-owners Dan Topping and [[Del Webb]] buying out his share of the ballclub.

MacPhail was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1978]]; his son [[Lee MacPhail]] was elected to the Hall in [[1998]], making them the only father and son inductees.
