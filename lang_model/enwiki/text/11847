The '''history of The Simpsons''' is relatively long for a TV show. The family debuted as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on [[April 19]] [[1987]] <ref name="goodnight">Richmond, p. 14</ref> and the show is still running after 20 years on television. In the mean time a film has been made and the show has made the news a couple of times.

==The Tracey Ullman Shorts==
{{main|The Simpsons shorts}}
Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' series. However, when Groening realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a [[dysfunctional family]].<ref name=inter>{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = David Bianculli| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM|WHYY]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008| city = Philadelphia| date = [[2003-02-14]]| accessdate = 2007-08-08}}</ref> He named the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The [[Simpson family]] first appeared as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on [[April 19]]  [[1987]].<ref name="goodnight"/> Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> The animation was produced domestically at [[Klasky Csupo]],<ref name="animation">{{cite news |first=Harvey |last=Deneroff|title=Matt Groening's Baby Turns 10||publisher=Animation Magazine, Vol. 14, #1|date=[[January 2000]]|pages=10, 12}}</ref> with [[Wesley Archer]], [[David Silverman]], and [[Bill Kopp]] being animators for the first season..<ref name="silverman">{{cite web|author=Cagle, Daryl|url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp|title=The David Silverman Interview|accessdate=2006-12-29|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref> After season one it was animated by Archer and Silverman.<ref name="silverman"/> Georgie Peluse was the colorist and the person who decided to make the characters yellow.<ref name="silverman"/>

The actors who voiced the characters would later reprise their roles in ''The Simpsons''. [[Dan Castellaneta]] performed the voices of [[Homer Simpson]], [[Abraham Simpson]], and [[Krusty the Clown]].<ref name="crew">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00-638898-1|pages=p. 178}}</ref> Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show. In the shorts, his voice is a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]], wheras it is more robust and humorous on the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brownfield, Paul|title=He's Homer, but This Odyssey Is His Own|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=[[1999-07-06]]}}</ref> [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], and [[Yeardley Smith]] performed the voices of [[Marge Simpson]], [[Bart Simpson]], and [[Lisa Simpson]] respectively.<ref name="crew"/> While most of the characters' personalities are similar to what they are in the series, Lisa is portrayed as a female version of Bart without the intelligent nature that she possesses in the half-hour series. 

The shorts were featured on the first three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show''. By the fourth and last season of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' the first season of the half-hour show was on the air. In the two first seasons the shorts were divided into three or four parts,<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00-638898-1|pages=pp. 14-15}}</ref> but in the third season they were played as a single story.<ref name="book"/> [[Tracey Ullman]] would later file a lawsuit, claiming that her show was the source of ''The Simpsons'' success and therefore should receive a share of the show's profit.

==The half-hour show==
===The first season===
{{main|The Simpsons (season 1)}}
In 1989, a team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The team included what is now the [[Klasky Csupo]] animation house. Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/article.php?id=568&IssueNum=32|title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer'|accessdate=2006-09-01|author=Kuipers, Dean|date=[[2004-04-15]]|publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat}}</ref> Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called "the mainstream trash" that they were watching.<ref name="toonterrific">{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker||title=Toon Terrific|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|date=[[1993-03-12]]|page=48(3)}}</ref> The half-hour series premiered on [[December 17]], [[1989]] with "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", a [[Christmas special]].<ref name=officialsite>[http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0101.htm "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"] ''The Simpsons.com''.

The series was originally set to debut in the fall of 1989 with the episode "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons episode)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", which was meant to introduce the main characters.<ref name="Groening"/> However, during the first screening of the episode, the producers discovered that the animation was so appalling that 70% of the episode needed to be redone.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|year=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The producers considered aborting the series if the next episode ("[[Bart the Genius]]") turned out as bad, but it only suffered from easily fixable problems.

The first season won one [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]], and received four additional nominations. Although television shows are limited to one episode a category, "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" was considered a separate special, and nominated alongside "[[Life on the Fast Lane]]" for Outstanding Animated Program; "Life on the Fast Lane" won the award. "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" was also nominated for "Outstanding Editing in a Miniseries or Special", while "The Call of the Simpsons" was nominated for "Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Comedy Series or a Special". The main theme song, composed by [[Danny Elfman]], was nominated for "Outstanding Achievement in Main Title Theme Music".<ref name="Emmy">[http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php Emmy Awards official site] "The Simpsons" "1989 - 1990" ''emmys.org''.

The show was controversial from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] to characterize him as a poor [[role model]] for children.<ref>Turner, p. 131</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6252856.stm|title=Is The Simpsons still subversive?|accessdate=2007-08-06|date=[[2007-06-29]]|author=Rosenbaum, Martin|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> At the time, then-current President [[George H.

===The second season===
{{main|The Simpsons (season 2)}}
"[[Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish]]" was the first episode produced for the season, but "[[Bart Gets an F]]" aired first because Bart was popular at the time and the producers had wanted to premiere with a Bart themed episode.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Bart Gets an F]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The second season featured a new [[The Simpsons opening sequence|opening sequence]], which was shortened by fifteen seconds from its original length of roughly 1 minute, 30 seconds. The opening sequence for the first season showed Bart stealing a "Bus Stop" sign; whilst the new sequence featured him skateboarding past several characters who had been introduced during the previous season. Starting with this season, there were three versions of the opening: a full roughly 1 minute 15 second long version, a 45 second version and a 25 second version. This gave the show's editors more leeway.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart Gets an F"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> 

Due to the show's success, over the summer of 1990, the Fox network decided to switch ''The Simpsons'' timeslots. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', the [[Nielsen Ratings#Annual top-rated shows|number one show]] at the time.<ref name="Reiss">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Bart Gets an F"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Many of the producers, including [[James L.

It would not be until the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] episode "[[Homer at the Bat]]" that ''The Simpsons'' would beat ''The Cosby Show'' in the ratings.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer at the Bat]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The show remained in its Thursday timeslot until [[The Simpsons (season 6)|season 6]].<ref name="Reiss"/>

===New Orleans controversy===
[[Image:New Orleans Chalk Gag.png|right|200px|thumb|The chalkboard gag for "[[Homer the Heretic]]"]]
During the fourth season they released the episode "[[A Streetcar Named Marge]]". The musical within the episode contains a controversial song about New Orleans, which describes the city as a "home of pirates, drunks and whores", among other things. Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, had meant the song to be a parody of the opening number in ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', which speaks of [[London]] in unflattering terms.<ref name="Martin2">{{cite video | people=Martin, Jeff|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD extra "The Cajun Controversy"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Al Jean later explained that two [[Cajun]] characters were supposed to walk out of the theater in disgust, but none of the voice actors could provide a convincing Cajun accent.<ref name=Lorando>Mark Lorando. "'Simpsons' takes a shot at Crescent City." ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1992-10-01]]. p. A1.</ref>

Before the premiere of the fourth season, the producers sent two episodes to critics: "[[Kamp Krusty]]" and "A Streetcar Named Marge".<ref name="Jean"/> A New Orleans critic viewed "A Streetcar Named Marge" and published the song lyrics in his newspaper before the episode aired.<ref name=Lorando/> Many readers took the lyrics out of context, and New Orleans' Fox affiliate, [[WNOL]], received about one hundred complaints on the day the episode aired. Several local radio stations also held on-air protests in response to the song.<ref>Mark Lorando. "Fox apologizes for 'Simpsons'. ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1992-10-02]]. p. B1.</ref>  

At the urging of WNOL, Fox president [[Jamie Kellner]] released a statement on [[October 1]], [[1992]] apologizing for the episode:

{{cquote|It has come to our attention that a comedic song about New Orleans in tonight's episode of "The Simpsons" has offended some city residents and officials. Viewers who watch the episode will realize that the song is in fact a parody of the opening numbers of countless Broadway musicals, which are designed to set the stage for the story that follows. That is the only purpose of this song. We regret that the song, taken out of context, has caused offence. This was certainly not the intention of "The Simpsons" production staff or Fox Broadcasting Company.<ref name="CC">{{cite video |year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD extra "The Cajun Controversy"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>}}

The ''Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> producers rushed out a [[chalkboard gag]] for "[[Homer the Heretic]]", which aired a week after "A Streetcar Named Marge". It read, "I will not defame New Orleans." The gag was their attempt to "apologize" for the song and hopefully bring the controversy to an end.<ref name="Martin2"/>  "We didn't realize people would get so mad," said Al Jean. "It was the best apology we could come up with in eight words or less."<ref> Mark Lorando. "Bart chalks up apology for New Orleans song." ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1992-10-08]]. p. A1.</ref> The issue passed quickly, and a person in a Bart Simpson costume even served as [[Krewe of Tucks]] Grand Marshal at the 1993 [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]].<ref>"For Silver Celebration, Tucks 'Lov-A-Da Music." ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1993-02-21]]. p. D7. [[1993-02-21]].</ref>

The episode generated further controversy in September 2005, when [[Channel 4]] in the [[United Kingdom]] decided to air the episode a week after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with [[Ofcom]]. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered a key part of the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur.<ref name="Ofcom">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb49/#skip|title=Issue number 46|accessdate=2007-08-24|date=2005|publisher=Ofcom}}</ref>

===Later seasons===
In 2002 Rio de Janeiro tourist board found the season 13 episode "[[Blame It on Lisa]]" so offending for the Brazilian people that they threatened to sue the producers. The board's exact word were "What really hurt was the idea of the monkeys, the image that Rio de Janeiro was a jungle ... It's a completely unreal image of the city". The producers' apologies and the issue did not go any further, but was international news for a while.<ref>Turner, p. 326</ref>

In [[The Simpsons (season 14)|Season 14]], production switched from traditional [[Traditional animation#Traditional ink-and-paint and camera|cel animation]] to [[Traditional animation#Digital ink and paint|digital ink and paint]].<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Jeffrey Lynch, Mike Reiss, David Silverman|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Whacking Day]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was "[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|Season 12]] episode "[[Tennis the Menace]]", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed "Tennis the Menace" was broadcast as made.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.license-europe.com/licensemag/data/articlestandard//licensemag/192007/425752/article.pdf|title=A Salute to the Simpsons|last=Grala|first=Alyson|pages=p. 14|publisher=''License Mag''|accessdate=2007-08-11}}</ref>
