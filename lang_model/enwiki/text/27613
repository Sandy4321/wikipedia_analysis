'''Edward Everett''' (April 11, 1794 <U+2013> January 15, 1865) was an [[United States|American]] politician, pastor, educator, diplomat, and orator from [[Massachusetts]]. Everett, a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], served as [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], the [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|15th]] [[Governor of Massachusetts]], [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Minister to Great Britain]], and [[United States Secretary of State]]. He also taught at [[Harvard University]] and served as [[President of Harvard University|its president]].

Everett was one of the great American [[orators]] of the antebellum and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era. He is often remembered today as the featured orator at the dedication ceremony of the [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] in 1863, where he spoke for over two hours{{emdash}}immediately before President [[Abraham Lincoln]] delivered his famous, two-minute [[Gettysburg Address]].

The son of a pastor, Everett was educated at Harvard, and briefly ministered at [[Boston]]'s [[Brattle Street Church]] before taking a teaching job at Harvard.  The position included preparatory studies in Europe, so Everett spent two years in studies at the [[University of G<U+00F6>ttingen]], and another two years traveling around Europe.  At Harvard he taught [[Ancient Greek literature]] for several years before becoming involved in politics, and began an extensive and popular speaking career.  He served ten years in the [[United States Congress]] before winning election as Governor of Massachusetts in 1835.  As governor he introduced the [[Massachusetts Board of Education|state Board of Education]], the first of its type in the nation.

After being defeated in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1839|1839 election]] by one vote, Everett was appointed Minister to Great Britain, serving until 1845.  He next became President of Harvard, a job he quickly came to dislike.  In 1849 he became an assistant to longtime friend and colleague [[Daniel Webster]], who had been appointed Secretary of State.  Upon Webster's death Everett served as Acting Secretary for a few months.  In the later years of his life Everett traveled, giving speeches all over the country.  He supported efforts to maintain the Union before the Civil War, running for [[United States Vice President|Vice President]] on the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] ticket in 1860.  He was active in supporting the Union effort during the war, and supported Lincoln in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:Birthplace of Edward Everett.jpg|left|thumb|Birthplace of Everett in Dorchester, MA. ca.1898 photo]]
Edward Everett was born on April 11, 1794 in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]] (then independent from [[Boston]]), the fourth of eight children, to the Rev. Oliver Everett and Lucy Hill Everett, the daughter of Alexander Sears Hill. His father was a direct descendant of early colonist [[Richard Everett]], and his mother's family also had deep colonial roots.<ref>''A Memorial of Edward Everett'', p. 9</ref> His father had served as pastor of [[New South Church (Boston, Massachusetts)|New South Church]], retiring due to poor health two years before Everett was born. He died in 1802, when Edward was eight, after which his mother moved the family to Boston. He attended local schools, and then a private school of Ezekiel Webster. During this time Ezekiel's brother [[Daniel Webster|Daniel]] sometimes taught classes; Everett and Daniel Webster would later form a close friendship.<ref>''A Memorial of Edward Everett'', pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref>

Everett attended [[Boston Latin School]] in 1805, and then briefly [[Phillips Exeter Academy]], where his older brother [[Alexander Hill Everett]] was teaching.<ref>Frothingham, p. 9</ref> At the age of 13, he was admitted to [[Harvard University|Harvard College]]. In 1811, at age 17, he graduated as the [[valedictorian]] of his class.  Unlike some of the other students at the time, Everett was an earnest and diligent student who absorbed all of what was taught.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 12<U+2013>14</ref>

==Pastor and student==
Uncertain what to do next, Everett was encouraged by his pastor, [[Joseph Stevens Buckminster]] of the [[Brattle Street Church]], to study for the ministry.  This he did under the tutelage of Harvard President [[John Thornton Kirkland]], earning his MA in 1813.  During this time in particular he developed a facility for working with both the written and spoken word.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 16<U+2013>18</ref>  The Reverend Buckminster died in 1812, and Everett was immediately offered the post at the Brattle Street Church on a probationary basis after his graduation, which was made permanent in November 1813.<ref>Frothingham, p. 20</ref>  Everett dedicated himself to the work, and became a highly popular preacher.  Listeners wrote of his "florid and affluent fancy", and his "daring imagery", while one critic wrote what would become a common criticism of his speaking style: "[Everett] spoke like some superior intelligence, discoursing to mortals of what they ought to feel and know, but as if [he] himself were too far exalted to require such feelings, and such knowledge himself."<ref>Frothingham, pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref>  Everett, over the year he served in the pulpit, came to be disenchanted with the somewhat formulaic demands of the required oratory, and with the sometimes parochial constraints the congregation placed on him.<ref>Varg, pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref>

[[Image:George Ticknor print with signature.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Everett's friend [[George Ticknor]] (1867 engraving)]]
The workload also took its toll on young Everett, who around this time acquired the nickname "Ever-at-it", which would be used throughout his life.<ref>Frothingham, p. 30</ref>  For a change of pace, Everett traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]], where he visited with Daniel Webster and other [[Federalist Party]] luminaries from Massachusetts.<ref>Frothingham, p. 31<U+2013>33</ref>  In late 1814 Everett was offered a newly-endowed position as professor of [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] at Harvard.  The position came with authorization to travel for two years in Europe, and Everett readily accepted.  He was formally invested as a professor in April 1815.<ref>Frothingham, p. 34</ref>

Everett made his way across western Europe, visiting [[London]] and the major Dutch cities en route to the German city of [[G<U+00F6>ttingen]].  There he entered [[University of G<U+00F6>ttingen|the university]], where he studied [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], along with [[Ancient Rome|Roman law]], [[archaeology]], and [[Ancient Greece|Greek art]].  He was a disciplined student, but he and [[George Ticknor]], with whom he had traveled, were also quite sociable.  Everett noted that they were viewed by many at the university as curiosities, and were often the focus of attention.  He was granted a [[Ph. D]] in September 1817, which he believed to be the first such degree awarded to an American.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 35<U+2013>41</ref>

During his sojourn at G<U+00F6>ttingen Everett traveled to see other German cities, including [[Hanover]], [[Weimar]], [[Dresden]], and [[Berlin]].  He received permission from Harvard to extend his time in Europe, and spent two more years traveling across the continent (from [[Constantinople]] and the [[Black Sea]] to [[Paris]]), visiting the major cities of the continent before returning to the United States in 1819.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 39<U+2013>60</ref>  Among those he met in England were the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] diplomat [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], an influential architect of the [[Prussian education system]], and [[William Wilberforce]], a leading English [[abolitionism|abolitionist]].<ref>Varg, p. 22</ref>  While in Constantinople Everett acquired a number ancient Greek texts which are now in the Harvard archives.<ref>Gregory, p. 1:412</ref>

==Teacher, writer, and speaker==
[[Image:Daguerreotype of Ralph Waldo Emerson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[daguerreotype]] by unknown photographer]]
Everett took up his teaching duties later in 1819, hoping to implant the scholarly methods of Germany at Harvard and bring a generally wider appreciation of German literature and culture to the United States.<ref>Adam, p. 325</ref>  For his Greek class he translated [[Philipp Karl Buttmann]]'s Greek lexicon.<ref>Frothingham, p. 61</ref>  Among his students were [[Robert Charles Winthrop]], [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].<ref>Frothingham, p. 62</ref>  Emerson had first heard Everett speak at the Brattle Street Church, and idolized him.  He wrote that Everett's voice was "of such rich tones, such precise and perfect utterance, that, although slightly nasal, it was the most mellow and beautiful and correct of all instruments of the time."<ref>Frothingham, p. 63</ref>

In 1820 Everett became editor of the ''[[North American Review]]'', a literary magazine to which he had contributed articles while studying in Europe.  In addition to editing he made numerous contributions to the magazine, which flourished during his tenure and reached a nationwide audience.<ref>Varg, p. 27</ref><ref>Adam, pp. 325<U+2013>326</ref>  He was also instrumental in expanding Harvard's collections of [[German language]] works, including grammars, lexicons, and a twenty-volume edition of the collected works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who he had visited in Weimar and whose works he championed on the pages of the ''Review''.<ref>Adam, p. 326</ref>

}}
Everett began his public speaking career while he taught at Harvard, which combined with his editorship of the ''Review'' to bring him some national prominence.<ref name=Katula71/>  He preached at a service held in the [[United States Capitol]] that brought him wide notice and acclaim in political circles.<ref>Frothingham, p. 65</ref>  In 1822 he delivered a series of lectures in Boston on art and antiquities.  The series was well attended, and he repeated it in subsequent years.  He made a major speech in December 1823 advocating for United States support of the Greeks in [[Greek War of Independence|their struggle for independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]].  This subject was adopted by Daniel Webster, who also made it the subject of a speech in Congress.  (Everett's support for Greek independence made him something of a hero in Greece, and his portrait hangs in the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery]] in [[Athens, Greece|Athens]].)<ref name=Katula71>Katula, p. 71</ref>  This collaboration between Webster and Everett was the start of a lifelong political association between the two men.<ref>Frothingham, p. 77</ref>

==Marriage and children==
On May 8, 1822 Edward Everett married Charlotte Gray Brooks, the daughter of [[Peter Chardon Brooks]] and Ann Gorham, who were like Everett of old New England lineage.<ref name=Haxtun34>Haxtun, p. 34</ref>  Brooks had made a fortune in a variety of business endeavors, including [[marine insurance]], and would financially support Everett when he embarked on his career in politics.  Everett would also become associated through the Brooks family with [[John Quincy Adams]]' son [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis]], who married one of Charlotte's sisters.<ref>Varg, pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref>

The Everetts had a happy and fruitful marriage,<ref>Varg, p. 24</ref> producing six children that survived infancy:<ref>Whittier, pp. 53<U+2013>54<!--records and dates except last son--></ref>

==Early political career==
[[File:Edward Everett - Project Gutenberg eText 15393.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait c. 1850 by R. M. Staigg]]
Everett had decided as early as 1821 that he did not particularly like teaching.<ref name=F71>Frothingham, p. 71</ref>
In July 1824 Everett gave an unexpectedly significant speech at Harvard's [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] that would alter his career trajectory.  Publicity for the event was dominated by the news that the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] would be in attendance, and the hall was packed.  The subject of his speech was "Circumstances of the Favorable Progress of Literature in America".  Everett pointed out that America's situation as an expanding nation with a common language and a democratic foundation gave its people a unique and distinctive opportunity for creating truly American literature.  Unfettered by Europe's traditions and bureaucracy, Americans could use the experiences of settling the west to develop a new style of intellectual thought.<ref>Katula, pp. 71<U+2013>76</ref>

The crowd reacted with lengthy applause, and not long afterward an informal non-partisan caucus nominated Everett as its candidate for the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref>Frothingham, p. 87</ref>  Other political factions also endorsed his candidacy, and he was easily elected in the November 1824 election.<ref>Katula, p. 77</ref>  He had expected to continue teaching at Harvard while serving, but was informed by its [[Harvard Board of Overseers|Board of Overseers]] that he had been dismissed because of the election victory.  He took this news in stride, even agreeing to refund to the college the costs of his European travels.<ref>Varg, p. 34</ref>  He continued to remain associated with Harvard, joining the Board of Overseers in 1827 and serving for many years.<ref name=SM108>Stratton and Mannix, p. 108</ref>

===United States Representative===
The political situation in the country was quite fluid in the late 1820s.  The [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] had collapsed, and the victorious [[Democratic-Republican Party]] had become diffuse, resulting in political factionalism in place of party affiliation. Everett was associated with the "[[National Republican]]" faction of John Quincy Adams and [[Henry Clay]]. He supported Clay's "[[National System]]" and the interests of Massachusetts' propertied class. Everett was re-elected to four additional terms as a National Republican, serving until 1835. The National Republicans formally became the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in 1834.

In Congress Everett sat on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and on the Committee on Libraries and Public Buildings, both of which he chaired in his last term.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 97, 112</ref>  Since he was already well known to President Adams, he was a frequent guest at the [[White House]], and came to champion the president's agenda in the House.<ref>Frothingham, p. 96</ref>  He supported tariff legislation that protected Massachusetts' growing industrial interests, favored renewal of the charter of the [[Second Bank of the United States]], and opposed the [[Indian Removal Act]].<ref>Frothingham, pp. 109<U+2013>121</ref>

[[Image:Daniel Webster - circa 1847.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Daniel Webster]], c. 1847 (Southworth & Hawes)]]
Everett's most controversial action in Congress took place relatively early during his tenure there.  In 1826 Congress debated a Constitutional amendment to alter the way the president was elected, so that Congress would not be required do decide (as it had in [[United States presidential election, 1824|the 1824 election]]).<ref>Frothingham, pp. 100<U+2013>101</ref>  Rising in opposition to the amendment on March 9, 1826, Everett delivered a three-hour speech in which he generally opposed the need to amend the Constitution.  However, he also expounded on the issue of slavery, noting that "the [[New Testament]] says 'Slaves obey your masters'", and accepting the document even though it contained the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].<ref>Frothingham, p. 106</ref>

Reaction to this speech was highly critical, and Everett was attacked by political friends and foes for this apparent endorsement of slavery.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 106<U+2013>107</ref>  He attempted to justify his statements by pointing out that he rejected the slave trade and the act of kidnapping someone into slavery, but this did not mitigate the damage, and he was heavily criticized for it in the Massachusetts press.  Everett would be dogged by the speech for the rest of his political career.<ref>Frothingham, p. 108</ref>

===Governor of Massachusetts===
Everett retired from Congress in 1835, after deciding that he did not really like the rough-and-tumble nature of the proceedings in the House.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 121, 125</ref>  He had been offered the nomination for [[Governor of Massachusetts]] by the [[Anti-Masonic Party]] in 1834; although he was known to be against secret societies like the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], he refused, and supported Whig [[John Davis (Massachusetts governor)|John Davis]] for governor that year.  Davis won the election, which was held in November 1834.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 127<U+2013>128</ref>  In February 1835, the state legislature elected Davis to the [[United States Senate]].  In an arrangement brokered in part by Daniel Webster, Everett was promised the Whig nomination for governor (a move that upset Lieutenant Governor [[Samuel Turell Armstrong]], who also sought the nomination).  Everett easily defeated the perennial [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate, [[Marcus Morton]], in November 1835.<ref>Varg, p. 64</ref><ref>Frothingham, pp. 129<U+2013>130</ref>  He was re-elected by comfortable margins in the three following years, all facing Morton.<ref name=F149>Frothingham, p. 149</ref>

One of the most notable achievements of Everett's tenure was the introduction of a state [[board of education]] to improve school quality and the establishment of ''[[normal school]]s'' for the training of teachers.  Based on details of the Prussian education system which Everett had learned about, this groundbreaking accomplishment would be emulated by other states.  The [[Massachusetts Board of Education|state Board of Education]] was established in 1837, with reformer [[Horace Mann]] as its secretary.  The state's first normal school opened in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] the next year (it afterward moved to Framingham and is now known as [[Framingham State University]]).<ref>Frothingham, pp. 136<U+2013>139</ref>

[[Image:MarcusMortonEngraving.jpg|thumb|left|[[Marcus Morton]] was Everett's principal opponent for governor]]
Other accomplishments during Everett's tenure include the authorization of an extension of the railroad system from Worcester to the [[New York]] state line,<ref>Frothingham, p. 141</ref> and assistance in the quieting of border tensions between [[Maine]] and the neighboring [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] (now [[Canada|Canadian]]) province of [[New Brunswick]].  Massachusetts was involved in this dispute because, as part of Maine's separation from the state in 1820, it retained ownership of public lands in the disputed area.  The border issue had been simmering for some years, but tensions rose substantially in the late 1830s as both sides pushed development activity into the disputed area, and the United States refused to accept a mediation proposal made by the Dutch king.  In 1838 Everett proposed to President [[Martin Van Buren]] that a special commission be established to address the issue.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 146<U+2013>147</ref>

[[Abolitionism#United States|Abolitionism]] and [[The Temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] were two issues that became more politically prominent during Everett's tenure, and both of those matters, as well as Whig indifference, would play a role in his defeat in the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 1839|1839 election]].  The abolitionist [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]] began to take shape in 1838, and the ill-timed passage of a temperance law banning the sale of less than {{convert|15|USgal|l}} of alcohol would drive popular support away from the Whigs in 1839.<ref name=F149/><ref>Hart, p. 4:88</ref><ref>Earle, pp. 72<U+2013>73</ref>  The election, held November 11, 1839, was so close that the results were scrutinized by the (Whig-dominated) legislature when it met in January 1840.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 151<U+2013>152</ref>  A joint legislative committee reported that Morton received exactly one-half the votes cast, sufficient to secure his victory.  (One vote less for Morton would have resulted in the Whig legislature deciding the election.)<ref>Frothingham, p. 153</ref>  Everett refused to contest the results despite calls from the party to do so; he wrote, "I am willing to let the election go."<ref>Frothingham, p. 154</ref>

== Diplomatic service ==
[[File:MaineBoundaryDispute.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing the extreme boundary claims (red=British, blue=United States), and the final border (yellow)]]
After leaving office, Everett traveled in Europe with his family for several months. When the Whigs, led by [[William Henry Harrison]], won the [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840 election]], Everett was appointed [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|ambassador to Great Britain]] at the recommendation of his friend Daniel Webster, who had been appointed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].<ref>Geiger, pp. 577<U+2013>581</ref>  Everett was at first charged with handling the northeast border issues he first encountered as governor.  A new British administration, friendlier to the United States than the previous one, sent [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Lord Ashburton]] to Washington to negotiate directly with Webster, and Everett's role was reduced to acquiring documents from British records, and pressing the American case to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]].  In this role Everett was instrumental in acquiring and distributing a map that vindicated the United States from accusations that it had cheated Britain out of land in the 1842 [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]].<ref>Geiger, pp. 583, 590<U+2013>595</ref>

Another major issue between the countries was the seizure of American ships by British naval forces interdicting the slave trade off the coast of Africa.  Owners of ships accused but acquitted of complicity in the trade filed claims to recover their losses with the British government, and Everett, as ambassador, advanced these cases.<ref>Geiger, p. 582</ref>  In this he was generally successful, given the friendly British stance.  One aspect of the slave trade interdiction proposed by Everett found its way into the treaty negotiated by Webster: the stationing of an American squadron off the coast of Africa to cooperate with the British effort.<ref>Geiger, pp. 583<U+2013>585</ref>  The issue of slaving-related seizures caused some friction at home, especially after Webster was replaced as Secretary of State by a succession of Southern politicians.  Everett in particular had to school [[John C. Calhoun]] on the diplomatic ramifications of pursuing claims after slaves mutinied aboard a ship plying the American coast and sailed it to [[The Bahamas]].<ref>Geiger, pp. 587<U+2013>589</ref>

Everett rebuffed several offers for other diplomatic posts proferred by Webster, who was unhappy serving under Tyler and apparently sought the UK ambassadorship as a way to distance himself from the unpopular president; Webster eventually resigned in 1843.<ref>Dalzell, pp. 44<U+2013>54</ref>  Everett remained at his post until 1845, when after the accession of [[James K. Polk]] to the presidency he was replaced by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Louis McLane]].<ref>Jones and Rakestraw, p. 211</ref>  His last months in the post were occupied with the [[Oregon boundary dispute]], which was eventually resolved by McLane along lines negotiated by Everett.<ref>Varg, pp. 116<U+2013>125</ref>

==Harvard Presidency==
Even before his departure from London, Everett was being considered as a possible successor to [[Josiah Quincy III|Josiah Quincy]] as [[President of Harvard University|President of Harvard]].  He returned to Boston in September 1845 to learn that the Overseers had offered him the post.  Although he had some misgivings, principally due to some of the tedious aspects of the job and difficult matter of maintaining student discipline, he accepted the offer, and entered into his duties in February 1846.
The three years he spent there were extremely unhappy.<ref name=SM108/>  Everett found that Harvard was short of resources, and that he was not popular with the rowdy students.<ref>Varg, pp. 130<U+2013>135</ref>  One of his most notable achievements was the expansion of Harvard's academic programs to include a "school of theoretical and practical science", then known as the [[Lawrence Scientific School]].<ref>Stratton and Mannix, p. 109</ref>

Everett's unhappiness with the post was apparent early on, and by April 1847 he was negotiating with Harvard's overseers about the conditions of the job.<ref>Frothingham, p. 293</ref>  These talks were ultimately unfruitful, and Everett, on the advice of his doctor, resigned the post in December 1848.<ref>Frothingham, p. 295</ref>  He had been suffering for sometime from a number of maladies, some of them [[prostate]] related.  In the following years, his health would become increasingly fragile.<ref>Varg, p. 136</ref>  He was somewhat rejuvenated by a visit to the springs at [[Sharon Springs, New York]].<ref>Frothingham, p. 303</ref>

==Secretary of State and Senator==
[[File:Edward Everett.png|left|thumb|upright|Edward Everett]]
When the Whigs won the [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848 national election]] and returned to power in 1849, Everett returned to politics. He served as an aide to Daniel Webster, who President [[Millard Fillmore]] appointed Secretary of State.  When Webster died in October 1852, Fillmore appointed Everett, apparently at Webster's request, to serve as Secretary of State during the remaining [[lame duck (politics)|lame-duck]] months of his administration. In this post Everett drafted the official letter that accompanied the [[Perry Expedition]] to [[Japan]], reversed Webster's claim denying [[Peru]]vian sovereignty over the guano-rich Lobos Islands, and refused to engage the United States in an agreement with the United Kingdom and France to guarantee Spanish control of [[Cuba]].<ref>Mihalkanin, p. 189</ref> Although he stated that the Fillmore administration had no interest in annexing Cuba, he made it clear that the U.S. did not want to foreclose the option by engaging in an essentially political alliance, and reinforced the notion that the U.S. saw Cuba as its concern and not a matter for outside interference.<ref>Mihalkanin, pp. 189<U+2013>190</ref>

While he was still serving as Secretary of State, Everett was approached by Massachusetts Whig leaders about running for the [[United States Senate]].  He was elected by the state legislature, and took the office on March 4, 1853.<ref>Varg, p. 151</ref>  In the Senate he sat on the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]], and on the Committee on Territories.<ref>Frothingham, p. 341</ref>  He was opposed to the extension of slavery in the western territories, but was concerned that the radical [[Free Soil Party]]'s hardline stance would result in disunion.<ref>Varg, pp. 156, 164</ref>  

Everett opposed the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]] when it was introduced in 1854, calling it a "horrible" and "detested" bill.<ref>Frothingham, p. 344</ref>  However, because of his health he missed a critical vote on the bill, departing the chamber during a debate that ended up lasting all night.<ref>Frothingham, p. 351</ref>  This angered Massachusetts [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] interests, who sent him a strongly-worded petition to submit to the Senate.  Because of his distaste for the more extreme elements in the abolition debate, Everett's speech in support of the petition was weak, for which he was further criticized.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 354<U+2013>357</ref>  The rancor of the situation greatly upset Everett, and he submitted his resignation letter on May 12, 1854, after only a little more than one year into his six-year term, once again citing poor health.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 358<U+2013>361</ref>

==Last years==

Free of political obligations, Everett traveled the country with his family, giving public speeches.  One cause he took up was the preservation of [[George Washington]]'s home at [[Mount Vernon]].  Over several years in the mid-1850s he toured, speaking about Washington (who he compared favorably to [[Frederick the Great]] and the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]).  Not only did he donate the proceeds from this touring (about $70,000), he also refused to deduct his travel expenses.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 377-379, 388<U+2013>389</ref>  He also agreed to write a weekly column for the ''[[New York Ledger]]'' in exchange for a $10,000 gift to the [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]].  These columns were eventually bound and sold as the ''Mount Vernon Papers''.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 387<U+2013>388</ref>

Everett was disheartened by the sectional divisions between the northern and southern states during the late 1850s.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 405<U+2013>407</ref>  The [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]] threatened to produce a national crisis, with pro-slavery Southerners splitting the Democratic Party, and threatening [[secession]] if a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] was elected President.  A group of conservative ex-Whigs organized the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], which claimed as its sole principle the preservation of the Union.<ref>Frothingham, p. 408</ref>  Supporters of Everett put his name forward as a candidate for president, but the party ended up nominating [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], and Everett for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].  Everett reluctantly accepted the post, but did not campaign very much. The Bell-Everett ticket received only 39 electoral votes, all from Southern states.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 409<U+2013>411</ref>

In the wake of the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], seven southern states began seriously debating secession.<ref>Donald, p. 305</ref>  Everett was an active participant in advancing the unsuccessful [[Crittenden Compromise]] in a last-ditch attempt to avoid war during the early months of 1861.<ref>Varg, p. 192</ref>  When the [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1861, he became an active supporter of the Union cause.  He did not at first think highly of Lincoln, but came to support him as the war progressed.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 415<U+2013>417</ref>  In 1861 and 1862 Everett toured the northern states, lecturing on the causes of the war, and also wrote on behalf of the Union cause for the ''New York Ledger''.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 425, 441</ref>  Proposals were put forward that Everett serve as a roving ambassador in Europe to counter [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] diplomatic initiatives, but these were never brought to fruition.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 442<U+2013>447</ref>

[[File:32 SummerSt Boston.png|thumb|right|upright|Everett lived in this house on [[Summer Street (Boston)|Summer Street]], Boston, 1852<U+2013>1865<ref>State Street Trust Company, p. 1855</ref>]]
In November 1863, when the military cemetery at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]] was dedicated, Everett was invited to be the featured speaker.<ref>Frothingham, pp. 451<U+2013>452</ref> In his two-hour formal oration he compared the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] to battles of antiquity such as [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]], and spoke about how opposing sides in previous civil wars (such as the [[War of the Roses]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]]) were able to reconcile their differences afterward.  Everett's oration was followed by the now far more famous [[Gettysburg Address]] of President Lincoln. For his part, Everett was deeply impressed by the concise speech and wrote to Lincoln noting "I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes."<ref>Frothingham, pp. 454<U+2013>458</ref>  In the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]], Everett supported Lincoln, serving as a presidential elector from Massachusetts for the Republicans.<ref>Frothingham, p. 462</ref>

==Death==
On January 9, 1865, Everett spoke at a public meeting in Boston to raise funds for the southern poor in Savannah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Everett,_Edward|title=Edward Everett|publisher=1911 Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref> At that meeting he caught cold, which he exacerbated four days later by testifying for three hours in a civil dispute concerning a property he owned in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]].<ref>Frothingham, p. 470</ref>  He died in Boston on January 15, and was interred at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]].<ref>Frothingham, pp. 469<U+2013>472</ref>

==Legacy==

Edward Everett Square, near his birthplace in Dorchester, is named for him. It is the intersection of Columbia Road, Massachusetts Avenue, East Cottage Street and Boston Street.  A marker is placed near where his birthplace stood, and a statue of Everett stands near the square in Richardson Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dorchesterhistoricalsociety.org/2012/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=17&Itemid=143|title=Dorchester Monuments|publisher=Dorchester Historical Society|accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref>  Everett's name appears on the facade of the Boston Public Library's [[Boston Public Library, McKim Building|McKim Building]],<ref>Katula, p. 10</ref> which he helped found, serving for twelve years as president of its board.<ref>Frothingham, p. 365</ref>  His name was also given to his nephew, [[Edward Everett Hale]], as well as Hale's grandson, the actor [[Edward Everett Horton]].<ref>Kear et al, p. 247</ref><ref>Reid, p. 6</ref>

[[Everett, Massachusetts]], separated from [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]] in 1870, was named in his honor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egovlink.com/public_documents300/everett/published_documents/City%20Clerk/History/Town%20History.pdf|title=History of Everett|publisher=City of Everett|accessdate=2013-05-08}}</ref> as was the borough of [[Everett, Pennsylvania]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bedfordcountybusiness.com/tourism-attractions/county-information/205-everett-pa/|title=Everett, PA|publisher=Bedford, PA County Business Directory|accessdate=2013-05-08}}</ref> and [[Mount Everett]] in western Massachusetts.<ref>Hayward, p. 653</ref>  Elementary schools in Dorchester<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardeverettschool.com/information-dorchester-paintings-and-edward-everett.html|title=Edward Everett School Information|publisher=Edward Everett School|accessdate=2013-05-08}}</ref> and in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wp.lps.org/everett/|title=Everett Elementary School|publisher=Lincoln Public Schools|accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> are named for him, as was a school in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] that was torn down in 1887.  Everett donated 130 books to St. Cloud, beginning the community's first library.<ref>Bell, p. 1414</ref>
