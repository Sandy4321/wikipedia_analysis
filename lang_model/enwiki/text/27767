'''Allen Lawrence Pope''' (born c. 1929) is a retired US aviator. Pope is a native of [[Miami]],{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=166}} Florida and graduate of the [[University of Florida]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=100}}

==USAF service==
After university, Pope entered the [[United States Air Force]] and served as a [[First lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in the [[Korean War]]. He flew a [[Douglas A-26 Invader|Douglas B-26 Invader]] in combat, winning three [[Air Medal]]s and a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=100}} After the war the USAF returned Pope to the USA as an air force instructor.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=100}}

==<U+0110>i<U+1EC7>n Bi<U+00EA>n Ph<U+1EE7>==
In March 1954 Pope left the USAF and joined a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[front organisation]], [[Civil Air Transport]], flying one of its [[Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar]]s to supply French forces besieged in the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Battle of <U+0110>i<U+1EC7>n Bi<U+00EA>n Ph<U+1EE7>]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=100}} On March 13 [[Viet Minh|Vi<U+1EC7>t Minh]] artillery disabled <U+0110>i<U+1EC7>n Bi<U+00EA>n Ph<U+1EE7>'s airstrip, so thereafter all supplies to the French garrison had to be dropped from the air.<ref name=AirAmerica>{{cite web |url=http://www.air-america.org/News/CAT_Pilots_Receive_French_Award.shtml |title=CAT Pilots to be Honored by France |date= December 13, 2008 |work=[[Air America]] |publisher=Air America Association}}</ref> CAT pilots flew hundreds of sorties from [[Cat Bi International Airport|Cat Bi]] to <U+0110>i<U+1EC7>n Bi<U+00EA>n Ph<U+1EE7>.<ref name=AirAmerica/> On May 6, 1958, the day before the French force surrendered, Pope was co-pilot of the lead aircraft in a group of six C-119s that made the last air drop to the besieged garrison.<ref name=AirAmerica/>

After the end of the [[First Indochina War]] that August, Pope remained with CAT making civilian charter flights firstly from [[Taiwan]] and then from [[Saigon]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=100}}

On February 24, 2005, France's ambassador to the USA, Jean-David Levitte, made the then 76 year old Pope and six other CAT pilots ''Chevaliers de la [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]'' for their service in the Battle of <U+0110>i<U+1EC7>n Bi<U+00EA>n Ph<U+1EE7>.<ref name=AirAmerica/> In 2005 Pope said of his Vietnam service:

{{quote |''I'm a communist fighter. I was born and raised to be against the communists.''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.air-america.org/newspaper_articles/france_honors_cat.shtml |title=France Honors CIA Pilots for Vietnam Service |last=Burns |first=Robert |date= February 15, 2005 |work=[[Air America]] |publisher=Air America Association}}</ref> }}

==AUREV service== 
In April 1958, CAT recalled Pope from Saigon to Taiwan and sent him to [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Philippines]], where he was assigned a B-26 Invader that had been painted black and had its markings obscured. On April 27, 1958 Pope landed the bomber at Mapanget, a rebel-held [[Indonesian Air Force]] base on the [[Minahassa Peninsula]] of northern [[Sulawesi]]. The rebels were [[Permesta]], led by dissident local army officers opposed to the government of President [[Sukarno]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=106}} At Mapanget, Pope joined another CAT pilot and former Air Force officer, [[William Beale (aviator)|William H Beale, Jr]], who had been flying a B-26 Invader for Permesta since April 19.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=100<U+2013>101}} The two bombers formed part of Permesta's ''Angkatan Udara Revolusioner'' ("Revolutionary Air Force") or AUREV.

Pope flew his first AUREV mission on April 27, attacking the government-held island of [[Morotai]] in the hours before a Permesta amphibious force successfully landed and took the island.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=106<U+2013>107}} The CIA instructed CAT pilots to target commercial shipping in order to frighten foreign merchant ships away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and undermining Sukarno's government.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=115}} On April 28, Pope attacked the government-held province of [[Central Sulawesi]]. Off the port of Donggala he bombed and sank three merchant ships: the ''Aquila'' (Italian), ''Armonia'' (Greek) and ''Flying Lark'' (registered in Panama).{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=115}} He continued the sortie by attacking [[Palu]], the provincial capital city, destroying 22 vehicles in a truck park.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=116}}

On April 29, Pope attacked the government-held province of [[South East Sulawesi]]. He struck the Indonesian Air Force base at [[Kendari]],{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=117<U+2013>118}} the provincial capital, with {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on|sing=on}} bombs and machine-gun fire.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=118}} He then strafed an [[Indonesian Navy]] patrol boat, KRI ''Intana'', killing five crew and wounding another 23.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=118}} On April 30, Pope again attacked Palu and Donggala; sinking a ship, destroying a warehouse and demolishing a bridge.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=118}}

On May 1, Pope attacked the city of [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]], the provincial capital of [[Maluku (Indonesian province)|Maluku]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=119}} His four 500 lb bombs missed his waterfront targets and fell in the sea.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=119}} He then tried a strafing run but his [[starboard]] engine suffered an explosion.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=119}} Pope aborted the attack and returned to Mapanget.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=119}}

It took several days for the B-26 to be given a replacement starboard engine. Pope's next sortie was on May 7, when he again attacked the government airbase at Ambon.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=121}} He seriously damaged a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] and caused other damage on the airbase.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=121}} On May 8 he attacked the Palu area in the morning{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=121}} and Ambon in the afternoon.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} On Ambon he bombed and machine-gunned the government-held Liang airbase in the northeast of the island, damaging the runway and destroying a [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} He then continued to Ambon city where he attacked an Indonesian Navy gunboat at anchor.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}} His bomb missed but he then attacked with machine-guns, wounding two crew and damaging the gunboat.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}}

Since May 1, Beale and his B-26 had been resting at Clark Air Base,{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=119}} leaving Pope's aircraft as AUREV's only active bomber. On May 9, Beale returned to Mapanget, releasing Pope who then took his turn to fly to Clark for several days' leave.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=122}}

On May 15, Pope attacked a small transport ship, the ''Naiko'', in Ambon Bay.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} She was merchant ship that the Indonesian Government had pressed into military service, and was bringing a company of Ambonese troops home from [[East Java]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=128}} His bomb hit the ''Naiko''{{'}}s engine room, killing one crew member and 16 infantrymen{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=128}} and setting the ship on fire.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} He then attacked Ambon city, aiming for the barracks. His first bomb missed and exploded in a market-place next door.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} His next landed in the barracks compound but bounced and exploded near an ice factory.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} He then returned to Mapanget to find that in his absence the Indonesian Air Force had bombed the rebel air base,{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=129}} destroying a CIA/AUREV PBY Catalina{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=126}} and damaging a CIA/AUREV [[North American P-51 Mustang]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=127}}

The Indonesian government alleged that Pope's bombing of a marketplace in Ambon city had killed a large number of civilians.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=131}} This later turned out to be untrue, but in the meantime the US Embassy in [[Jakarta]] protested to the [[United States Department of State]] which then warned the CIA team in Manado.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=132}} The CIA tightened its AUREV pilots' [[rules of engagement]] so that they could attack only airfields and boats.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=132}} They were no longer allowed to attack buildings <U+2014> not even military ones.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=132}}

==Capture and trial==
By mid-May, Indonesian government forces were planning amphibious counter-attacks on the islands of Morotai and [[Halmahera]]{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=134}} that Permesta had captured toward the end of April. This involved assembling a naval and transport fleet in Ambon bay, where ships started to arrive from [[Java]] on May 16.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=134}} At 0300 on May 18, Pope took off from Mapanget to attack Ambon again.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=132}} He first attacked the airfield, destroying the C-47 and P-51 that he had damaged on May 7.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=136}} A short distance west of Ambon Bay he found the invasion fleet,{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=136}} which included two 7,000 ton merchant ships being used as troop transports.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=134}} One of the transports, the ''Sawega'', which was trying to take evasive maneuvers as Pope attacked it.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=137}} His bomb fell in the sea {{convert|40|m}} short of its target.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=138}}

The Indonesian Air Force had one serviceable P-51 Mustang on Ambon, at Liang airbase. When Pope attacked Ambon airfield on May 18, the P-51 at Liang was scrambled to repel him.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=136}} The P-51 closed on the B-26 just as Pope was attacking the ''Sawega''.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=138}} The convoy took both aircraft to be AUREV and fired on both of them.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=139}} The P-51 also hit the B-26 and damaged its starboard wing{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=138}} and the bomber caught fire.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=139}} Pope and his Permesta radio operator, Jan Harry Rantung, bailed out.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=139}}{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=141}} As they jumped, the B-26 was entering a sharp dive and the [[slipstream]] threw Pope against the tail fin, fracturing his right leg. {{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=139}} They landed on the coast of Pulau Hatala, a small island west of Ambon, where a small Indonesian Navy landing party from one of the invasion fleet's minesweepers put ashore and captured them.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=141}}<ref name=Time-580609>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', June 9, 1958</ref> 

Some 20 other AUREV insurgent aircraft were reported to have been seen with [[Republic of China Air Force|Nationalist Chinese]] markings obscured by hasty coats of paint. Their pilots were Nationalist Chinese and Americans from CAT.<ref name=Time-580609/> US Ambassador Howard Jones portrayed Pope as an American ''"paid [[mercenary|soldier of fortune]]"'' and expressed his regret at the involvement of an American.<ref name=Time-580609/> However, Pope was carrying about 30 incriminating documents that added to the embarrassment of the [[Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower administration]] in the USA when he was captured.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|pp=132<U+2013>33}}

Pope admitted only to flying one{{sfn|Lert|1998|p=}} or two{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=161}} missions, but his flight log (which was among the 30 documents that he was carrying when he was captured) recorded eight.{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=161}} Pope ''"spent the early hours of Sunday, May 18, over Ambon City in eastern Indonesia, sinking a navy ship, bombing a market, and destroying a church. The official death toll was six civilians and seventeen military officers"''.{{sfn|Weiner|2007|pp=175-76}} When Pope was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, he was pursuing a ship carrying one thousand Indonesian troops. ''"His last bomb missed the troopship by about forty feet, sparing hundreds of lives".''{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=176}}

After fracturing his right thigh when bailing out,{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=141}} Pope worked himself back into shape in prison, and read enough law books to help conduct his own defense. He said he felt he was fighting international communism. An Indonesian four-man [[military court]] rejected Pope's plea that he be considered a [[prisoner of war]]. It found him guilty of killing 17 members of Indonesia's armed forces and six civilians and sentenced him to death.<ref>''Time'', May 9, 1960</ref>

The death sentence was not carried out and Pope was released in July 1962 at the behest of the USA's [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] after the President's brother, [[Robert Kennedy]], met President Sukarno earlier in the year and appealed for Pope's release.{{sfn|Prados|2003|p=177}}

{{quote |''I enjoyed killing Communists<U+2026>  They ''said'' Indonesia was a failure''[, Al Pope reflected bitterly]''. But we knocked the shit out of them. We killed thousands of Communists, even though half of them probably didn't even know what Communism meant.''{{sfn|Weiner|2007|p=177}} }}

==Southern Air Transport==
After his release, Pope returned to Miami where he joined [[Southern Air Transport#Southern Air Transport (1947-1998)|Southern Air Transport]].{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=166}} Like CAT, SAT was a CIA front organization{{sfn|Conboy|Morrison|1999|p=166}} flying covert missions in regions including southeast Asia.
