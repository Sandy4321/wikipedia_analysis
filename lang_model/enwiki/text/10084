'''James Earl''' '''"Jimmy"''' '''Carter, Jr.''' (born October 1, 1924) served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|39th]] [[President of the United States]] from 1977 to 1981 and was the recipient of the 2002 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the only U.S. President to have received the Prize after leaving office. Prior to becoming president, Carter served two terms in the [[Georgia Senate]] followed by the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governorship of the state of Georgia]], from 1971 to 1975,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-676 |title=Jimmy Carter |encyclopedia=New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgia Humanities Council |accessdate=December 9, 2007}}</ref> and was a peanut farmer and naval officer.
 
As president, Carter created two new cabinet-level departments: the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]] and the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II). Carter sought to put a stronger emphasis on human rights; he negotiated a peace treaty between [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] in 1979. His return of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama was seen as a major concession of US influence in Latin America, and Carter came under heavy criticism for it. His term came during a period of persistent [[stagflation]] in a number of countries, including the United States, which significantly damaged his popularity. The final year of his presidential tenure was marked by several major crises, including the 1979 takeover of the American embassy in [[Iran]] and [[Iran hostage crisis|holding of hostages]] by Iranian students, an unsuccessful [[Operation Eagle Claw|rescue attempt]] of the hostages, [[1979 energy crisis|serious fuel shortages]], and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. By 1980, Carter's disapproval ratings were significantly higher than his approval, and he was challenged by [[Ted Kennedy]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 election]]. Carter defeated Kennedy for the nomination, but lost the election to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ronald Reagan]].
 
After leaving office, Carter and his wife [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]] founded [[The Carter Center]] in 1982,<ref>"[http://www.cartercenter.org/about/history/chronology.html Timeline and History of The Carter Center]". ''The Carter Center''. Retrieved February 16, 2010.</ref> a nongovernmental, [[not-for-profit organization]] that works to advance human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, observe elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] project,<ref name=Habitat>{{cite web |accessdate= |url=http://www.habitat.org/how/carter.aspx |title=Jimmy Carter and Habitat for Humanity |publisher=Habitat for Humanity Int'l}}</ref> and also remains particularly vocal on the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]].

==Early life==

[[File:Jimmy and Lillian Carter.jpg|right|thumb|With his mother, [[Lillian Carter]], February 17, 1977]]
Jimmy Carter is a native [[Georgia (US state)|Georgian]], born and raised in the tiny southwest Georgia hamlet of [[Plains, Georgia|Plains]] near the larger town of [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]]. The Carter family originated from southern England (Carter's paternal ancestor arrived in the American Colonies in 1635),<ref>"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915294,00.html The Nation: Magnus Carter: Jimmy's Roots]". ''Time''. August 22, 1977. Retrieved February 16, 2010.</ref> and had lived in the state of Georgia for several generations; his great-grandfather, Private L.B. Walker Carter (1832<U+2013>1874), served in the [[Confederate States Army]]. 

The first president born in a hospital,<ref name=USA-Presidents>{{cite web |accessdate= |url=http://www.usa-presidents.info/carter.htm |title=Jimmy Carter |publisher=USA-Presidents.org}}</ref> he was the eldest of four children of [[James Earl Carter, Sr.|James Earl Carter]] and [[Lillian Gordy Carter|Bessie Lillian Gordy]]. Carter's father was a prominent business owner in the community and his mother was a registered nurse. He was a gifted student from an early age who always had a fondness for reading. By the time he attended Plains High School, he was also a star in basketball. He was greatly influenced by one of his high school teachers, Julia Coleman (1889<U+2013>1973). While he was in high school he was in the [[Future Farmers of America]] , which later changed its name to the [[National FFA Organization]] , serving as the Plains FFA Chapter Secretary.<ref name=FFA>{{cite web |accessdate= |url=http://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf |format=PDF |title=National FFA Organization: Prominent Former Members |publisher=National FFA Organization}}</ref>

After high school, Carter enrolled at [[Georgia Southwestern College]], in Americus.  He would later apply to the [[United States Naval Academy]] and, after taking additional mathematics courses at [[Georgia Tech]], he was admitted in 1943.  Carter graduated 59th out of 820 midshipmen.<ref name=DeGregorio2005>{{cite book 
|last=DeGregorio |first=William A. |title=The Complete Book of US Presidents. |volume=Volume 1
|location=Fort Lee |publisher=Barricade Books |year=2005}}</ref>

Carter had three younger siblings: his brother, [[Billy Carter|William Alton "Billy" Carter]] (1937<U+2013>1988), and sisters [[Gloria Carter Spann]] (1926<U+2013>1990) and [[Ruth Carter Stapleton]] (1929<U+2013>1983). During Carter's Presidency, his brother Billy was often in the news, often in an unflattering light.

He married [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn Smith]] in 1946. They had four children: [[John William Carter|John William "Jack" Carter]] (born 1947); [[James Earl "Chip" Carter III]] (born 1950); [[Donnel Jeffrey "Jeff" Carter]], (born 1952) and [[Amy Carter|Amy Lynn Carter]] (born 1967).

He is a cousin of Motown founder [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy Jr.]] on his mother's side, and a cousin of the late [[June Carter Cash]] <ref>Cash, John R. with Patrick Carr. (1997) Johnny Cash, the Autobiography. [[Harper Collins]]</ref>.

===Naval career===
Carter served on surface ships and on diesel-electric submarines in the [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic]] and [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]]. As a junior officer, he completed qualification for command of a diesel-electric submarine. He applied for the [[United States Navy|US Navy's]] fledgling [[nuclear submarine]] program run by then Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]]. Rickover's demands on his men and machines were legendary, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on him.

Carter has said that he loved the Navy, and had planned to make it his career. His ultimate goal was to become [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. Carter felt the best route for promotion was with submarine duty since he felt that nuclear power would be increasingly used in submarines. During service on the diesel-electric submarine {{USS|Pomfret|SS-391|6}}, Carter was almost washed overboard.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hayward |first=Steven F. |title=The Real Jimmy Carter: How Our Worst Ex-President Undermines American |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Regnery Publishing |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UEGPFXrScoIC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=jimmy+carter+submarine+overboard&source=web&ots=9n-MWEDXCU&sig=pzsKSE1nPr_8Hl4HRY5ZxvGgPg8|year=2004 |isbn=0895260905}}</ref> After six years of military service, Carter trained for the position of engineering officer in submarine {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|6}}, then under construction.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/video/carter_03.html#v278 PBS's American Experience Jimmy Carter].</ref> Carter completed a non-credit introductory course in nuclear reactor power at [[Union College]] starting in March 1953. This followed Carter's first-hand experience as part of a group of American and Canadian servicemen who took part in cleaning up after a partial [[nuclear meltdown]] at Canada's [[Chalk River Laboratories]] reactor in 1952.<ref>[http://www.ccnr.org/paulson_legacy.html Reactor Accidents: The Human Fallout<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref><ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/timeline/index.html American Experience | Jimmy Carter | Timeline<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref>

Upon the death of his father, James Earl Carter, Sr., in July 1953, Lieutenant Carter immediately resigned his commission, and he was discharged from the Navy on October 9, 1953.<ref>[http://www.jimmycarterlibrary.org/documents/jec/jcnavy.phtml Jimmy Carter's Naval Service<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref><ref>"[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq60-14.htm Naval Service of Jimmy Carter]". ''Department of the Navy <U+2013> Naval Historical Center''. October 19, 2010. Retrieved February 16, 2010.</ref> This cut short his nuclear powerplant operator training, and he was never able to serve on a nuclear submarine, since the first boat of that fleet, the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'' (SSN-571)]], was launched on January 17, 1955, over a year after his discharge from the Navy.<ref>[http://atomicinsights.blogspot.com/2006/01/picking-on-jimmy-carter-myth.html Atomic Insights Blog: Picking on the Jimmy Carter myth<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref>

===Farming and teachings===
After his naval service, Carter then took over and expanded his family business in Plains. There he was involved in a peanut farming accident that left him with a permanently bent finger. His farming business was successful, and during the 1970 gubernatorial campaign, he was considered a wealthy peanut farmer.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904462-1,00.html New Crop of Governors <U+2013> TIME<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref>

From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to Christianity, serving as a Sunday School teacher throughout his life. Even as President, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus Christ was the driving force in his life. Carter had been greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man, called, "If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?"<ref>{{cite book|title=Conversations with Carter| isbn=1555878016|year=1998|page=14| first1=Jimmy |last1= Carter| first2= Don |last2= Richardson|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers}}</ref>

==Early political career==
===State Senate===
Jimmy Carter started his career by serving on various local boards, governing such entities as the schools, hospitals, and libraries, among others. In the 1960s, he served two terms in the [[Georgia Senate]] from the fourteenth district of Georgia.

His 1961 election to the state Senate, which followed the end of Georgia's [[County Unit System]] (per the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Gray v. Sanders]]''), was chronicled in his book ''Turning Point: A Candidate, a State, and a Nation Come of Age''. The election involved corruption led by Joe Hurst, the sheriff of [[Quitman County, Georgia|Quitman County]]; system abuses included votes from deceased persons and tallies filled with people who supposedly voted in alphabetical order. It took a challenge of the fraudulent results for Carter to win the election. Carter was reelected in 1964, to serve a second two-year term.

For a time in State Senate he chaired its Education Committee.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org">"[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/GovernmentPolitics/Politics/PoliticalFigures&id=h-676 Jimmy Carter (b. 1924)]". ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. Updated May 9, 2008. Retrieved February 16, 2010.</ref>

In 1966, Carter declined running for re-election as a state senator to pursue a gubernatorial run. His first cousin, Hugh Carter, was elected as a Democrat and took over his seat in the Senate.

===Campaigns for Governor===
{{Main|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1966}}
In 1966, during the end of his career as a state senator, he flirted with the idea of running for the [[United States House of Representatives]]. His Republican opponent dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia. Carter did not want to see a Republican Governor of his state, and, in turn, dropped out of the race for Congress and joined the race to become Governor. Carter lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third place candidate to force the favorite, [[Ellis Arnall]], into a [[two-round system|runoff election]], setting off a chain of events which resulted in the election of [[Lester Maddox]]. During this race Carter ran as a moderate alternative to both liberal Arnall and conservative Maddox.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org"/>  Although he lost, his strong third place finish was viewed as a success for a little-known state senator.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia.org"/> 

{{Main|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1970}}

For the next four years, Carter returned to his agriculture business and carefully planned for his next campaign for Governor in 1970, making over 1,800 speeches throughout the state.

During his 1970 campaign, he ran an uphill populist campaign in the Democratic primary against former Governor [[Carl Sanders]], labeling his opponent "Cufflinks Carl". Carter was never a [[racial segregation|segregationist]], and refused to join the segregationist [[White Citizens' Council]], prompting a boycott of his peanut warehouse. He also had been one of only two families which voted to admit blacks to the Plains Baptist Church.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/peopleevents/p_jcarter.html People & Events: James Earl ("Jimmy") Carter Jr. (1924<U+2013>)] <U+2013> [[American Experience]], [[PBS]], accessed March 18, 2006.</ref> However, he "said things the segregationists wanted to hear", according to historian [[E. Stanly Godbold]].<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carter/filmmore/pt.html American Experience | Jimmy Carter | Transcript<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref> Also, Carter's campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent celebrating with black basketball players.<ref>[http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.977/article_detail.asp The Claremont Institute <U+2013> Malaise Forever<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref><ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761566991/Jimmy_Carter.html "Jimmy Carter"], Microsoft [[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia 2005, accessed March 18, 2006. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwrtgWxP Archived] 2009-10-31.</ref> Following his close victory over Sanders in the primary, he was elected Governor over Republican [[Hal Suit]].

==Governor of Georgia==
Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971 and held this post for one term, until January 14, 1975. Governors of Georgia were not allowed to succeed themselves at the time. His predecessor as Governor, [[Lester Maddox]], became the [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia|Lieutenant Governor]]. However, Carter and Maddox found little common ground during their four years of service, often publicly feuding with each other.<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Applebome |title=In Georgia Reprise, Maddox on Stump |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDF143FF937A25752C0A966958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=January 14, 1990 |accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.racematters.org/lestermaddox.htm Race Matters <U+2013> Lester Maddox, Segregationist and Georgia Governor, Dies at 87<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref>

===Civil rights politics===
Carter declared in his inaugural speech that the time of racial segregation was over, and that racial discrimination had no place in the future of the state. He was the first statewide office holder in the [[Deep South]] to say this in public.<ref>http://www.blackjournalism.com/?p=183</ref> Afterwards, Carter appointed many African Americans to statewide boards and offices. He was often called one of the "New Southern Governors"{{ndash}} much more moderate than their predecessors, and supportive of racial desegregation and expanding African-Americans' rights.

===Abortion===
Although "personally opposed" to abortion, subsequent to the landmark [[US Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 US 113 (1973) Carter supported legalized abortion.<ref>{{cite

===State government reforms===
Carter improved government efficiency by merging about 300 state agencies into 30 agencies. One of his aides recalled that Governor Carter "was right there with us, working just as hard, digging just as deep into every little problem. It was his program and he worked on it as hard as anybody, and the final product was distinctly his." He also pushed reforms through the legislature, providing equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia, set up community centers for mentally handicapped children, and increased educational programs for convicts. Carter took pride in a program he introduced for the appointment of judges and state government officials. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit, rather than political influence.<ref>{{cite|url=http://photo.pds.org:5005/student/printarticle?id=ar097440|title=Carter, Jimmy|publisher=World Book Student|author=Hugh S.

===Vice-Presidential aspirations in 1972===
In 1972, as US Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota was marching toward the Democratic nomination for President, Carter called a news conference in Atlanta to warn that McGovern was unelectable. Carter criticized McGovern as too liberal on both foreign and domestic policy, yet when McGovern's nomination became a foregone conclusion, Carter lobbied to become his vice-presidential running mate. 

During the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] he endorsed the candidacy of Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] of [[Washington]].<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58482 Our Campaigns <U+2013> US President <U+2013> D Convention Race <U+2013> July 10, 1972<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref> However, Carter received 30 votes at the [[1972 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in the chaotic ballot for Vice President. McGovern offered the second spot to [[Reubin Askew]], from next door Florida and one of the "new southern governors", but he declined.

===Death penalty and crime===
After the US Supreme Court overturned Georgia's death penalty law in 1972, Carter quickly proposed state legislation to replace the death penalty with life in prison (an option which previously didn't exist).<ref>Craig Brandon, ''The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History'', 1999, p. 242.</ref>

When the legislature passed a new death penalty statute, Carter, despite voicing reservations about its constitutionality<ref>http://www.nodeathpenalty.org/content/new_abolitionist.php?issue_id=8&story_id=100</ref>, signed new legislation on March 28, 1973<ref>[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ Death Penalty Information Center<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref> to authorize the death penalty for murder, rape and other offenses, and to implement trial procedures which would conform to the newly-announced constitutional requirements. In 1976, the Supreme Court upheld Georgia's new death penalty for murder; in the case of ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional as applied to rape.

Many in America were outraged by [[William Calley]]'s life sentence at [[Fort Benning]] for his role in the [[My Lai Massacre]]; Carter instituted "American Fighting Man's Day" and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of Calley.<ref name="'70s 84">{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0465041957|page= |pages=84<U+2013>85 |url= }}</ref> Indiana's governor asked all state flags to be flown at half-staff for Calley, and Utah's and Mississippi's governors also disagreed with the verdict.<ref name="'70s 84"/>

Despite his earlier support, Carter soon became a death penalty opponent, and during Presidential campaigns (like previous nominee George McGovern and two successive nominees, [[Walter Mondale]] and [[Michael Dukakis]]), this was noted.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/12/07/democrats_shift_on_death_penalty/ Democrats shift on death penalty <U+2013> The Boston Globe].</ref> Currently, Carter is known for his outspoken opposition to the death penalty in all forms; in his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture, he urged "prohibition of the death penalty".<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/12/10/carter.transcript/ CNN.com <U+2013> Carter Nobel Peace Prize speech <U+2013> December 10, 2002].</ref>

===United States Senate appointment===
<!---tremendously interesting BUT article is about Carter NOT Russell-->
<!---please remember that senatorial appointment was an important act of Carter as Governor-->
[[Richard Russell, Jr.]], then-[[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]], died in office on January 21, 1971. Carter, only nine days into his governorship, appointed state Democratic Party chair [[David H. Gambrell]] to fill an unexpired Russell term in the Senate on February 1.<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000034 GAMBRELL, David Henry <U+2013> Biographical Information<!--Bot-generated title-->].</ref> Gambrell was defeated in the next Democratic [[primary election|primary]] by the more conservative [[Sam Nunn]].

===Other activities===
In 1973, while Governor of Georgia, Carter filed a report on his [[Jimmy Carter UFO incident|1969 UFO sighting]] with the International UFO Bureau in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Robert Scott|title=Celebrities Have Close Encounters, Too|publisher=Space.com|date=October 15, 1999|url=https://www.space.com/sciencefiction/phenomena/celebrity_ufo_991015.html|doi= |accessdate=April 16, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Horvath|first=Alex|title=Bolinas man's film says we are not alone|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=February 7, 2003|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/02/07/NB128511.DTL&type=printable|accessdate=April 16, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stenger|first=Richard|title=Clinton aide slams Pentagon's UFO secrecy|publisher=CNN|date=October 22, 2002|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/space/10/22/ufo.records/index.html|accessdate=April 16, 2007}}</ref> However, in 2007, Carter stated that he did not remember why he filed the report and that he believes he probably only did it at the request of one of his children. He also stated he does not believe it was an alien spacecraft, but rather believes it was likely some sort of military experiment being conducted from a nearby military base.<ref>[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]], [http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=105 July 25, 2007 episode].</ref>

Carter made an appearance as the first guest of the evening on an episode of the game show ''[[What's My Line]]'' in 1974, signing in as "X", lest his name give away his occupation. After his job was identified on question seven of ten by [[Gene Shalit]], he talked about having brought movie production to the state of Georgia, citing ''[[Deliverance]]'', and the then-unreleased ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]''.

In 1974, Carter was chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s congressional, as well as gubernatorial, campaigns.

==1976 presidential campaign==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1976}}

When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries in 1976, he was considered to have little chance against nationally better-known politicians. He had a [[name recognition]] of only two percent. When he told his family of his intention to run for President, his mother asked, "President of what?" However, the [[Watergate scandal]] was still fresh in the voters' minds, and so his position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C., became an asset. The centerpiece of his campaign platform was government reorganization.

[[File:ElectoralCollege1976.svg|thumb|300px|right||The electoral map of the 1976 election]]
Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the [[Iowa caucus]]es and the [[New Hampshire primary]]. He used a two-prong strategy: In the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's George Wallace, Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters and had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He traveled over 50,000 miles, visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidates even announced that they were in the race.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/video/carter_01.html#v276 PBS Amex Jimmy Who?].</ref> Initially dismissed as a regional candidate, Carter proved to be the only Democrat with a truly national strategy, and he eventually clinched the nomination.

The media discovered and promoted Carter, as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond'':

{{cquote|What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.}}

Carter was interviewed by [[Robert Scheer]] of ''[[Playboy]]'' for its November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election. It was here that in the course of a digression on his religion's view of pride, Carter admitted: "I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times."<ref>"The Playboy Interview: Jimmy Carter." Robert Scheer. ''Playboy'', November 1976, Vol. 23, Iss. 11, pp. 63<U+2013>86.</ref> He remains the only American president to be interviewed by this magazine.

As late as January 26, 1976, Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters, according to a [[Gallup poll]]. Yet "by mid-March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, he also led President [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] by a few percentage points", according to Shoup.

He chose Senator [[Walter Mondale|Walter F. Mondale]] as his running mate. He attacked Washington in his speeches, and offered a religious salve for the nation's wounds.<ref name = "Dyer-2004">American Presidency, Brinkley and Dyer, 2004.</ref>

Carter began the race with a sizable lead over Ford, who was able to narrow the gap over the course of the campaign, but was unable to prevent Carter from narrowly defeating him on November 2, 1976. Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford and received 297 [[electoral college|electoral votes]] to Ford's 240. He became the first contender from the [[Deep South]] to be elected President since the [[US presidential election, 1848|1848 election]].

{{Main|Presidency of Jimmy Carter}}

Carter was elected over Gerald Ford and Eugene McCarthy in 1976. His tenure was a time of continuing inflation and recession, as well as an energy crisis. On January 7, 1980, Carter signed [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=32978 Law H.R. 5860 aka Public Law 96-185] known as ''The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979'' bailing out [[Chrysler Corporation]]. He led the plan to deregulate the airline industry.  He canceled military pay raises during a time of high inflation and government deficits.  He declared amnesty to Vietnam draft dodgers.  He encouraged energy conservation, installed solar panels on the White House,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unity.edu/news/solar1004.htm|title= Maine college to auction off former White House solar panels|date=October 28, 2004|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/27/white-house-solar-panels_n_160575.html|work=Huffington Post|title=White House Solar Panels: What Ever Happened To Carter's Solar Thermal Water Heater?

While attempting to calm various conflicts around the World, most visibly in the Middle East resulting in the signing of the Camp David Accords, giving back the Panama Canal and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with the USSR, the final year of his administration was marred by the [[Iran hostage crisis]] which contributed to his loss in his 1980 campaign for re-election to Ronald Reagan.

He wore a sweater on April 17, 1977 and delivered a fireside chat where he famously declared that the energy situation was the [[President Jimmy Carter's Moral Equivalent of War Speech|moral equivalent of war]] while clenching his fist.  

Carter wrote that the most intense and mounting opposition to his policies came from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which he attributed to [[Ted Kennedy]]<U+2019>s ambition to replace him as president.<ref>Carter, Jimmy''Our Endangered Values: America<U+2019>s Moral Crisis'', p.8, (2005), Simon & Shuster</ref>

==Post-Presidency==
In 1981, Carter returned to Georgia to his peanut farm, which he had placed into a [[blind trust]] during his presidency to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. He found that the trustees had mismanaged the trust, leaving him over one million dollars in debt. In the years that followed, he has led an active life, establishing The Carter Center, building his presidential library, teaching at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and writing numerous books.<ref name = "Dyer-2004"/>

===Legacy===
When he first left office, Carter's presidency was viewed by some as a failure.<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2006/12/13/cstillwell.DTL</ref><ref>http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2000/0121politics_hess.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1810305,00.html</ref> In [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|historical rankings of US presidents]], the Carter presidency has ranged from #19 to #34.

Although Carter has also received mixed reviews in both television and film documentaries, such as the [[Man from Plains]] (2007), the 2009 Documentary, [[Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace]], credits Carter's efforts at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East. The film opened the 2009 Monte-Carlo Television Festival in an invitation-only royal screening<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/world/news/e3if90a53b1b75730c95f2c168b2d3a2790 The Hollywood Reporter]</ref> on June 7, 2009 at the [[Grimaldi Forum]] in the presence of His Serene Highness [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]].<ref>World Screen http://www.worldscreen.com/articles/display/21252</ref> The film has not yet shown in the United States, an indication of Carter's comparatively high popularity overseas versus at home in the U.S.<ref>''Politique & Societe, by Lois Bolton; "Revisiting the Carter Presidency" date: 08/07/2009 (http://www.podcastjournal.net/Revisiting-the-Carter-Presidency_a2512.html)</ref>

Jimmy Carter and [[Walter Mondale]] are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On December 11, 2006, they had been out of office for 25 years and 325 days, surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both died on July 4, 1826.

Jimmy Carter is one of only four presidents,<ref>The other three presidents are [[William Henry Harrison]], [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Andrew Johnson]].</ref> and the only one in modern history, who did not have an opportunity to nominate a judge to serve on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

In the wake of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon's]] [[Watergate Scandal]], exit polls from the 1976 Presidential election suggested that many still held [[Gerald Ford]]'s pardon of Nixon against him,<ref>http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/27/opinion/polls/main2301584.shtml</ref> and Carter by comparison seemed a sincere, honest, and well-meaning Southerner.<ref name=indy/>

When Carter ran for reelection, [[Ronald Reagan]]'s nonchalant self-confidence contrasted to Carter's serious and introspective temperament.  Carter's personal attention to detail, seeming indecisiveness and weakness with people was also accentuated by Reagan's charm and easy delegation of tasks to subordinates.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDE1039F93BA25756C0A96F948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=WASHINGTON TALK; Carter Begins to Shed Negative Public Image|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=January 28, 2009}}</ref>  Ultimately, the combination of the economic problems, [[Iran hostage crisis]], and lack of Washington cooperation made it easy for Reagan to portray him as an ineffectual leader.

Since leaving office, Carter's reputation has much improved.  Carter's presidential approval rating, which sat at 31% just prior to the 1980 election, was polled in early 2009 at 64%.<ref>http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/07/time-kind-to-former-presidents-cnn-poll-finds.</ref>  Carter's continued post-Presidency activities have also been favorably received.

As President, Carter expressed a goal of making government "competent and compassionate."  In pursuit of that vision, he has been involved in a variety of national and international public policy, conflict resolution, human rights and charitable causes.

In 1982, he established [[The Carter Center]] in Atlanta to advance human rights and alleviate unnecessary human suffering.  The non-profit, nongovernmental Center promotes democracy, mediates and prevents conflicts, and monitors the electoral process in support of free and fair elections.  It also works to improve global health through the control and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of diseases such as [[Guinea worm disease]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], [[malaria]], [[trachoma]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], and [[schistosomiasis]].  It also works to diminish the stigma of mental illnesses and improve nutrition through increased crop production in Africa. A major accomplishment of The Carter Center has been the elimination of more than 99% of cases of [[Guinea worm disease]], a debilitating parasite that has existed since ancient times, from an estimated 3.5 million cases in 1986 to fewer than 10,000 cases in 2007.<ref>[http://cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/index.html Carter Center Guinea Worm Eradication Program], Retrieved August 4, 2008.</ref>  The Carter Center has monitored 70 elections in 28 countries since 1989.<ref>[http://www.cartercenter.org/peace/democracy/observed.html Elections Observed by The Carter Center], retrieved August 4, 2008.</ref>  It has worked to resolve conflicts in [[Haiti]], [[Bosnia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]] and other countries. Carter and the [[The Carter Center|Center]] actively support human rights defenders around the world and have intervened with heads of state on their behalf.

===Nobel Peace Prize===
In 2002, President Carter received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work "to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development" through The Carter Center.<ref>[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], 2002 Nobel Peace Prize announcement,[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2002/press.html], October 11, 2002, accessed August 4, 2008.</ref> Three sitting presidents, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] and Barack Obama, have received the prize; Carter is unique in receiving the award for his actions after leaving the presidency.  He is, along with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], one of only two native Georgians to receive the Nobel.

===Diplomacy===
====North Korea====
In 1994, [[North Korea]] had expelled investigators from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and was threatening to begin processing spent nuclear fuel.  In response then-President Clinton pressured for US sanctions and ordered large amounts of troops and vehicles into the area to brace for war.

Bill Clinton secretly recruited Carter to undertake a peace mission to North Korea,<ref>Marion V. Creekmore, ''A Moment of Crisis: Jimmy Carter, The Power of a Peacemaker, and North Korea's Nuclear Ambitions'' (2006).</ref> under the guise that it was a private mission of Carter's.  Clinton saw Carter as a way to let North Korean President [[Kim Il-sung]] back down without losing face.<ref>http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0405.kaplan.html</ref>

Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il-sung, but went further and outlined a treaty which he announced on CNN without the permission of the Clinton White House as a way to force the US into action.  The Clinton Administration signed a later version of the [[Agreed Framework]], under which North Korea agreed to freeze and ultimately dismantle its current nuclear program and comply with its [[nonproliferation]] obligations in exchange for oil deliveries, the construction of two [[light water reactors]] to replace its [[graphite moderated reactors|graphite reactors]], and discussions for eventual diplomatic relations.

The agreement was widely hailed at the time as a significant diplomatic achievement.<ref>{{cite

In 2001, President George W. Bush had taken a confrontational position toward North Korea and, in January 2002, named it as part of an "[[Axis of Evil]]."  Meanwhile, North Korea began developing the capability to [[enriched uranium|enrich uranium]].  Bush Administration opponents of the [[Agreed Framework]] believed that the North Korean government never intended to give up a nuclear weapons program, but supporters believed that the agreement could have been successful and was undermined.<ref name = "commentary10824">{{cite web

Carter has also criticized the presidency of George W. Bush and the Iraq War.  In a 2003 ''New York Times'' editorial, Carter warned against the consequences of a war in Iraq and urged restraint in use of military force.<ref>Jimmy Carter, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EFDE113FF93AA35750C0A9659C8B63)"Just War <U+2013> or a Just War?"], ''New York Times'', March 9, 2003. Retrieved August 4, 2008.</ref>  In March 2004, Carter condemned George W. Bush and [[Tony Blair]] for waging an unnecessary war "based upon lies and misinterpretations" in order to oust [[Saddam Hussein]].  In August 2006, Carter criticized Blair for being "subservient" to the Bush administration and accused Blair of giving unquestioning support to Bush's Iraq policies.<ref>{{cite news

On May 19, 2007, Mr. Blair made his final visit to Iraq before stepping down as [[British Prime Minister]], and Carter used the occasion to criticize him once again.  Carter told the [[BBC]] that Blair was "apparently subservient" to Bush and criticized him for his "blind support" for the Iraq war.<ref name=bbc080705>{{cite news

}}</ref>  Carter described Blair's actions as "abominable" and stated that the British Prime Minister's "almost undeviating support for the ill-advised policies of President Bush in Iraq have been a major tragedy for the world."  Carter said he believes that had Blair distanced himself from the Bush administration during the run-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it may have made a crucial difference to American political and public opinion, and consequently the invasion might not have gone ahead.  Carter states that "one of the defenses of the Bush administration ... has been, okay, we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us.  So I think the combination of Bush and Blair giving their support to this tragedy in Iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective, and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted."  Carter expressed his hope that Blair's successor, [[Gordon Brown]], would be "less enthusiastic" about Bush's Iraq policy.<ref name=bbc080705/>

In June 2005, Carter urged the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay Prison]] in Cuba, which has been a focal point for recent claims of [[prisoner abuse]].<ref>Associated Press, [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/national/nationalspecial3/08carter.html?_r=1&oref=login "Carter says US should close detention center at Guantanamo"], June 8, 2005.

In September 2006, Carter was interviewed on the BBC's current affairs program ''[[Newsnight]]'', voicing his concern at the increasing influence of the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] on US politics.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_5340000/newsid_5347800?redirect=5347830.stm&news=1&bbwm=1&bbram=1&nbram=1&nbwm=1 Newsnight audio recording], September 2006, BBC.</ref>

Due to his status as former President, Carter was a [[superdelegate]] to the 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]].  Carter announced his endorsement of Senator (now president) Barack Obama.  This occurred on June 3, 2008, near the end of the primary season.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Speaking to the English Monthly Forward gazine]] of [[Syria]], Carter was asked to give one word that came to mind when mentioning President George W. Bush.  His answer was:  the end of a very disappointing administration.  His reaction to mentioning Barack Obama was:  Honesty, intelligence, and politically adept.<ref>http://www.fw-magazine.com/content/president-jimmy-carter-speaks-forward Jimmy Carter Speaks to Forward Magazine.</ref>

In 2009 he put weight behind allegations by Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]], pertaining to United States involvement in the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt]] by a [[Military dictatorship|civilian-military junta]], saying that Washington knew about the coup and may have taken part.<ref>http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2009/09/200992116049879437.html</ref>

===Death penalty===
Carter continues to speak out against the death penalty in the US and abroad. Most recently, in his letter to the Governor of New Mexico, [[Bill Richardson]], Carter urged him to sign a bill to eliminate the death penalty and institute life in prison without parole instead. The bill has already been passed by the state House and Senate. Carter wrote: ''As you know, the United States is one of the few countries, along with nations such as Saudi Arabia, China, and Cuba, which still carry out the death penalty despite the ongoing tragedy of wrongful conviction and gross racial and class-based disparities that make impossible the fair implementation of this ultimate punishment''.<ref>http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-voices-jimmy-carter-urges-new-mexico-governor-support-death-penalty-repeal</ref>

Carter also called for commutations of death sentences for many death-row inmates, including [[Brian K. Baldwin]] (executed in 1999 in [[Alabama]]),<ref>http://www.law.northwestern.edu/wrongfulconvictions/issues/deathpenalty/Executinginnocent/alBaldwinbsummary.html</ref> [[Kenneth Foster]] (sentence in [[Texas]] commuted in 2007)<ref>http://www.democracynow.org/2007/8/29/jimmy_carter_desmond_tutu_urge_texas</ref><ref>http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/clemency</ref> and [[Troy Anthony Davis]] (Georgia, case pending).<ref>http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/clemency_troy_davis.html</ref>

===Torture===
In a 2008 interview with [[Amnesty International]], Carter criticized the alleged use of torture in at Guantanamo Bay, saying that it "contravenes the basic principles on which this nation was founded."<ref>{{youtube|tkz_FLxaKnI|Torture can never be justified}}</ref>  He stated that the next President should publicly apologize upon his inauguration, and state that the United States will "never again torture prisoners."

{{quote|The ultimate purpose of my book is to present facts about the Middle East that are largely unknown in America, to precipitate discussion and to help restart peace talks (now absent for six years) that can lead to permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors.

===Participation in ceremonial events===
Carter has participated in many ceremonial events such as the opening of his own presidential library and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. He has also participated in many forums, lectures, panels, funerals and other events. Carter delivered a eulogy at the funeral of [[Coretta Scott King]] and, most recently, at the [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|funeral of his former political rival]], but later his close, personal friend and diplomatic collaborator, Gerald Ford. Whether Carter will be included in the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program]] depends on whether he is still alive in 2014.

===Race in politics===
Carter ignited debate in September 2009 when he stated, "I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man, that he is African-American."<ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/ns/nightly_news_with_brian_williams#32884816</ref><ref>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32869276/ns/politics-capitol_hill/</ref> Obama disagreed with Carter's assessment. On CNN Obama stated, "Are there people out there who don't like me because of race? I'm sure there are...that's not the overriding issue here."<ref>http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/59451-obama-plays-down-role-of-race-in-criticism</ref>

===Funeral and burial plans===
Carter intends to be buried in front of his home in Plains, Georgia. In contrast, most Presidents since [[Herbert Hoover]] have been buried at their presidential library or presidential museum, with the exception of [[John F. Kennedy]], who is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who is buried at his own [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park|ranch]]. Both President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were born in Plains. Carter also noted that a funeral in [[Washington, D.C.]] with visitation at the Carter Center is being planned as well.<ref>Associated Press, [http://web.archive.org/web/20080509034756/http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8LPLR1G0&show_article=1 President Carter Talks of Funeral Plans], December 3, 2006.
