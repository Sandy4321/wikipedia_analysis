'''Licodia Eubea''' ({{lang-scn|'''Licudd<U+00EC>a'''}}) is a town and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[province of Catania]], on the island of [[Sicily]]. It is bounded by the comuni of [[Caltagirone]], [[Chiaramonte Gulfi]], [[Giarratana]], [[Grammichele]], [[Mazzarrone]], [[Mineo]], [[Monterosso Almo]] and [[Vizzini]]. It rises over an internal hilly area, 630 meters above the sea-level. 

Situated above a hill overlooking the valley of the [[Dirillo]] river, Licodia Eubea boasts a rich production of olives, almonds, citrus fruits, and excellent table grapes, that can be tasted during the annual Sagra dell'Uva (Grapes' festival) held in the month of September. Cattle breeding, as well as horse, sheep, and goat farms, are flourishing, not to mention the production of absolutely delicious typical Sicilian cheeses.

Beautiful to visit are the Chiesa Madre dedicated to S. Margherita, erected during the 17th century, preserving the emblem of the Santapau family on its front portal, the Chiesa del Rosario of the 18th century, and the Palazzo Municipale (Town Hall building).

==History==
The name Licodia derives from the Greek word 'Licos' meaning wolf, which is why its Coat-of-Arms has a picture of a wolf. The suburb belonged to lord Riccardo Filangieri, and was afterwards bestowed to nobleman Manfredi Aragona. 

The name Eubea was given to the place in 1872, to identify with the [[Greece|Greek]] city of ''Eubea'', the colony of [[Leontini]], founded early in the 6th century BC on the same site of an unknown [[Sicels|Sicel]] settlement. Vases of the First Period were found and all the tombs explored in 1898 belonged to the Fourth Period (700-500 BCE), and show the gradual process of [[Hellenization]] among the Sicels.

In 1392, the ancient castle was bestowed to the Santapau family, that gave it its name and owned it until the 16th century, when it passed under the dominion of lord Vincenzo Ruffo. In [[1693 Sicily earthquake|1693]], the town was devastated by the earthquake, and experienced a slow reconstruction.
