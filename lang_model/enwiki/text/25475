"'''Night Terrors'''" is the ninth episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 6)|sixth series]] of the British [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] and [[BBC America]] on 3 September 2011. It was written by [[Mark Gatiss]] and directed by [[Richard Clark (director)|Richard Clark]].

In the episode, alien time traveller [[Eleventh Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams|Rory]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]) decide to make a "house call" to an eight-year-old boy named George (Jamie Oram) who is terrified of almost everything, and especially dreads the cupboard in his bedroom. While the Doctor discusses this with George's father Alex ([[Daniel Mays]]), Amy and Rory become trapped in a dolls house with terrifying life-size [[peg dolls]].

"Night Terrors" was inspired by Gatiss's fear of dolls, and the ones in the episode were designed to be scary and crude-looking. The episode was moved from the first half of the series to the second, which necessitated changes to make it fit into the series' [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Death of the Doctor|story arc]]. It was the first to be filmed, with production taking place in September 2010 at a council estate in [[Bath, Somerset]] and a building in [[Dyrham Park]] which was designed as the doll's house. The episode was watched by 7.07 million viewers in the UK and received generally positive reviews from critics, though some were critical of how it fit into the overarching story as it came after a [[Let's Kill Hitler|heavy story-arc episode]].

==Plot==
[[Eleventh Doctor|The Doctor]] decides to make a "house call" after his [[List of Doctor Who items#Psychic paper|psychic paper]] receives a message from George, a frightened 8-year-old child, asking his help in getting rid of the monsters in his bedroom. On arrival at a [[council estate]] on present-day Earth, the Doctor, [[Amy Pond|Amy]], and [[Rory Williams|Rory]] split up to try to locate the child. The Doctor, taking the guise of a social services worker, finds the right flat, and meets George's father, Alex, while his mother Claire is working a night shift. Through Alex's photo album, the Doctor learns that George has been frightened all his life, fearing many of the sounds and people around the flat and is helped to cope by utilising various habits, including metaphorically placing his fears within his wardrobe.

Meanwhile, Amy and Rory, while taking the lift down, suddenly find themselves in what appears to be an eighteenth-century house, but shortly discover most of the furnishings are wooden props. Other residents of the estate appear in the house, but are caught by life-sized [[Peg wooden doll|peg dolls]] that laugh and sing like children, and transform the residents into more dolls. Amy and Rory witness one transformation and try to flee, but Amy is caught and becomes a doll herself, joining the others in chasing Rory.

The Doctor, suspecting that the wardrobe is containing the evil that George fears, opens it to find its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire did not appear pregnant in the weeks leading up to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire's desired child through a [[List of Doctor Who items#Perception filter|perception filter]], and has the ability to literally lock away his fears within the wardrobe. George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into the wardrobe, joining Rory in the dollhouse. As the dolls descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is able to open the wardrobe and appears in the dollhouse, but the dolls turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through the dolls to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.

===Continuity===
The Doctor refers to "Snow White and the Seven Keys to Doomsday", "The Three Little Sontarans" and "The Emperor Dalek's New Clothes" as being among his childhood nursery stories, referencing the 1974 stage play ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday|Seven Keys to Doomsday]]''<ref name="4thdimension" /> and the [[Sontaran]]s and the [[Emperor Dalek]], two of the series' recurring monsters.<ref name="bs381">{{Cite book|last=Burk|first=Graeme|last2=Smith?|first2=Robert|title=Who Is the Doctor: The Unofficial Guide to Doctor Who-The New Series|chapter=Series 6|edition=1st|date=6 March 2012|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|page=381|isbn=1550229842|ref=harv}}</ref> He also repeats his predilection for tea and [[Jammie Dodgers]] from another Gatiss-written episode, "[[Victory of the Daleks]]".<ref name="bs381"/>

Episode writer [[Mark Gatiss]] told ''[[Radio Times]]'' that he had always been scared of dolls, and was surprised that ''Doctor Who'' had never used them before. He was especially interested in [[Peg wooden dolls|peg dolls]], which he said were "the stuff of proper nightmares".<ref name="RTinterview">{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Jones|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2011-09-02/doctor-who-mark-gatiss-on-new-episode-night-terrors|title=Doctor Who: Mark Gatiss on new episode Night Terrors|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=2 September 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> Gatiss had previously worked with guest actor [[Daniel Mays]] in the BBC serial ''[[Funland]]'' and purposely inserted the line "Maybe later" into the script as it had been "a bit of a catchphrase" for the two on ''Funland''.

In order to achieve a greater variety of stories in the first half of series 6 "Night Terrors" was moved to the second block of episodes, having been filmed as episode four and showing up in promos for the first half of the season.<ref name= "DWM430">{{Cite journal|title=Episodes shuffle for the 2011 series...|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|issue=430|page=7|date=9 Feb 2011 (cover date)}}</ref> This necessitated minor changes to the episode, including the removal of a recurring sequence featuring the appearance of [[List of Doctor Who villains#Madame Kovarian|Madame Kovarian]].<ref name=4thdimension>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014983t|title=Night Terrors&nbsp;<U+2014> The Fourth Dimension|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> The original last scene was dropped, and a new one was written so it would make sense at that point in the series.<ref name="tease">{{cite web|first=Morgan|last=Jeffery|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/british-tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a314124/mark-gatiss-teases-doctor-who-episode.html|title=Mark Gatiss teases 'Doctor Who' episode|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=12 April 2011|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref> This scene consisted of nursury rhyme; lead writer [[Steven Moffat]] wanted to foreshadow [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Death of the Doctor|the Doctor's death]] and asked Gatiss to write a nursury rhyme, which he described as "rather wonderful".<ref name="confidential"/> Variations of the rhyme are heard in "[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]" and the series finale "[[The Wedding of River Song]]".<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]|series=[[Doctor Who]]|credits=[[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]] (writer), Steve Hughs (director), Denise Paul (producer)|airdate=24 September 2011|seriesno=6|number=12|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=[[The Wedding of River Song]]|series=[[Doctor Who]]|credits=[[Steven Moffat]] (writer), Jeremy Webb (director), Marcus Wilson (producer)|airdate=1 October 2011|seriesno=6|number=13|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC One]]}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Reception to the episode has been generally positive to mixed. Dan Martin of the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' commented that the episode was an improvement on Gatiss's previous three episodes&nbsp;<U+2013> "[[The Unquiet Dead]]", "[[The Idiot's Lantern]]" and "[[Victory of the Daleks]]". He complimented it overall as "a classy, creepy episode of retro ''Doctor Who''" in comparison to "[[Let's Kill Hitler]]", though he saw its plot as over-similar to "[[The Empty Child]]" and other episodes written by Steven Moffat.<ref name="guardian">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Martin|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/03/doctor-who-night-terrors|title=Doctor Who: Night Terrors&nbsp;<U+2014> series 32, episode 9|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=3 September 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> Martin later rated it the tenth best episode of the series, though [[The Wedding of River Song|the finale]] was not included in the list.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Martin|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/sep/30/best-episode-13th-doctor-who|title=Doctor Who: which is the best episode of this series?|work=The Guardian|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> Gavin Fuller of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' praised the dolls for "stealing the show", as well as the concept of the doll's house.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite web|first=Gavin|last=Fuller|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/8737901/Doctor-Who-Night-Terrors-BBC-One-review.html|title=Docto Who Night Terrors, BBC One, review|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=3 September 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref>

[[IGN]]'s Matt Risley rated the episode 8 out of 10, praising Gatiss's script which "moved the drama and horror straight into the miniaturised heart of a rickety creepy dolls house, with a set of villains that&nbsp;<U+2014> while never as memorable or scary as their look may suggest&nbsp;<U+2014> used sound design to its most effective". He said that the main story "soared", though the sidelined Amy and Rory left "little impact" in relation to the Doctor, George, and Alex.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Risley|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/119/1192198p1.html|title=Doctor Who: "Night Terrors" Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=4 September 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> Russell Lewin of ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' gave "Night Terrors" three and a half out of five stars, saying that it had "many great things going for it but perhaps hasn't quite got that little extra ''something'' that would have turned it into a classic" and that nothing seemed especially unexpected. However, he praised the shots of the doll house and apartment buildings, the sound, dolls, the acting of Matt Smith and Daniel Mays, and the idea of George being alien who created the reality.<ref name="SFX">{{cite web|first=Russell|last=Lewin|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/09/03/doctor-who-%e2%80%9cnight-terrors%e2%80%9d-tv-review/|title=Doctor Who "Night Terrors" TV Review|work=SFX|date=3 September 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref>

Blair Marnell of [[Crave Online]] noted that "Night Terrors" was reminiscent of the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second series]] episode "[[Fear Her]]", but said that this episode "fared a little bit better because it didn't rely on Jamie Oram's George to be anything more than a scared little boy". She also praised Matt Smith's performance and Arthur Darvill's Rory, who was "quickly becoming one of the funniest companions of the new ''Doctor Who''", though she commented that Amy's transformation into a doll was "kind of glossed over within the story itself" and "there was never any doubt that it would be reversed". Overall, the episode was given a 7 out of 10 rating.<ref name="Crave">{{cite web|first=Blair|last=Marnell|url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/reviews/173724-doctor-who-609-night-terrors|title=Doctor Who 6.09 'Night Terrors'|publisher=[[Crave Online]]|date=4 September 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> Sam McPherson, writing for [[Zap2it]], called "Night Terrors" the "worst episode of series 6 so far" that was an "incoherent mess of an episode that was utterly unenjoyable" and gave it an overall grade of a C+. He criticised the idea to follow up a [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Death of the Doctor|story arc]]-heavy episode with a standalone one, as he felt it "served as a speed bump for the forward momentum started in "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]" and continued through "Let's Kill Hitler". He thought that its "biggest flaw" was that George was sidelined in favour of Alex, which missed an opportunity to make it a story "about little boys overcoming fear and fighting off the monsters in their closets". However, he did praise dialogue delivered by Smith and Darvill.<ref name="zap2it">{{cite web|first=Sam|last=McPherson|url=http://www.tvovermind.com/doctor-who/doctor-episode-609-night-terrors-review/|title=Doctor Who Episode 6.09 "Night Terrors" Review|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|date=4 September 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref>

Because the episode was originally planned to be in the first half of the series, many of the reviewers mentioned that it was strange that Amy and Rory did not comment upon what had happened previously, such as what had happened to [[River Song (Doctor Who)|their child]].<ref name="telegraph" /><ref name="Crave" /> McPherson noted the "tacked-on" nursery rhyme foreshadowing [[The Impossible Astronaut|the Doctor's death]] was included, though he thought it was "unintelligible" and did not count.<ref name="zap2it" />
