The '''[[United States Senate]] election in [[New York]] in 2000''' was held on November 7, 2000.  [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], the first First Lady to run for political office, defeated [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Rick Lazio]].  The general election coincided with the [[2000 U.S. presidential election]].

The race began in November 1998 when four-term incumbent New York Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] announced his retirement. Both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] sought high-profile candidates to compete for the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] were the likely respective nominees. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured successful strategies, mistakes, and dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race.

The Republicans chose lesser-known Congressman [[Rick Lazio]] to replace him.  The election included a record $90 million in campaign expenditures between Clinton, Lazio, and Giuliani and national visibility.  Clinton showed strength in normally Republican upstate areas and a debate blunder by Lazio solidified Clinton's previously shaky support among women.  Clinton won the election in November 2000 with 55&nbsp;percent of the vote to Lazio's 43&nbsp;percent.

Both parties tried to find high-profile candidates to run for it.

[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]], who was prevented by term limits from running for mayoral reelection in 2001, immediately indicated interest.<ref name="cnn110698"/> Due to his high profile and visibility, Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party, even though he had irritated many by endorsing incumbent Democratic Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] over Republican [[George Pataki]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=1994 Ad|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n22_v46/ai_15999869|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=1994-11-21|accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref>  
Giuliani became the presumptive Republican nominee, and by April 1999 had formed a formal exploratory committee for a Senate run.  There were still possible Republican primary opponents. [[Rick Lazio]], a [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] representing [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] on [[Long Island]], was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for August 16;<ref name="cnn081199">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/11/senate.2000/lazio.suspends/index.html | title=Lazio suspends Senate plans | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=1999-08-11 | accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> he had openly discussed a primary against Giuliani, believing his more conservative record would be appealing to Republican primary voters.  In early August, under pressure from state and national Republican figures, Pataki endorsed Giuliani.<ref name="cnn081199"/>  Pataki prevailed upon Lazio to forgo his candidacy, which Lazio agreed to despite frustration that Giuliani had still not officially announced that he was running; Lazio said, "If the mayor wants to be a candidate, I think he needs to get into this race. It's time to put the soap opera aside and step up to the plate."<ref name="cnn081199"/>  [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] Congressman [[Peter T.

More seriously, on November 11, 1999, at the dedication of a U.S.-funded health program in the [[West Bank]], she exchanged kisses with [[Suha Arafat]], wife of Palestinian President [[Yasser Arafat]], after Suha Arafat had delivered a speech claiming that [[Israel]] had deliberately poisoned Palestinians through environmental degradation and the use of "poisonous gas".<ref name="cnn-suha">{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9911/11/israel.hillary.02/ | title=Hillary Clinton decries 'inflammatory' Mideast rhetoric | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=1999-11-11 | accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>  Some Israeli supporters said that Clinton never should have kissed the wife of the Palestinian leader, especially after such inflammatory remarks.

While Clinton had a solid base of support in [[New York City]], candidates and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state's voters live. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits with the purpose of rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal tax cuts for college tuition and long-term care.<ref name="cnn110700">{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ | title=Hillary Rodham Clinton scores historic win in New York | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=2000-11-08 | accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> 
Lazio faced a unique tactical problem campaigning upstate. The major issue there was the persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks on the state of the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor [[George Pataki]], however, limiting the effect of this line of attack. 

Opponents continued to make the carpetbagging issue a focal point throughout the race and during debates.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D9103CF93AA35753C1A9669C8B63 | title=Excerpts From Second Debate Between Mrs. Clinton and Lazio | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2000-10-09 | accessdate=2008-02-18}}</ref>  [[Talk radio]] hammered on this, with New York-based [[Sean Hannity]] issuing a daily mantra, "Name me three things Hillary Clinton has ever done for the people of New York!"

A September 13, 2000 debate between Lazio and Clinton proved important.  Lazio was on the warpath against [[soft money]] and the amounts of it coming from the [[Democratic National Committee]] into Clinton's campaign, and challenged Clinton to agree to ban soft money from both campaigns.  He left his podium and waved his proposed paper agreement in Clinton's face;<ref name="gvn-212">Gerth, Van Natta Jr., ''Her Way'', pp. 212-213.</ref> many debate viewers thought he had invaded her [[personal space]]<ref name="salon112707"/> and as a result Clinton's support among women voters solidified.<ref name="gvn-212"/>

Late in the campaign Lazio criticised Clinton for accepting campaign donations from various Arab groups in the wake of the {{USS|Cole|DDG-67|6}} attack. This issue caused former New York Mayor [[Ed Koch]] to take out ads telling Lazio to "stop with the sleaze already,"<ref name="gvn-212"/> and did not change the dynamic of the race.

Clinton won the election on November 7 with 55% of the vote to Lazio's 43%,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2000/2000senate.htm#NY | title=Federal Elections 2000: U.S. Senate results | publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]] | accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> a difference larger than most observers had expected.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E7D71638F93AA35752C1A9669C8B63 | title=First Lady Emerges From Shadow And Begins to Cast Her Own | author=[[Elisabeth Bumiller]], Dean E. Murphy | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2000-11-09 | accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref><ref name="nyt110900an"/> Clinton won the traditionally Democratic base of [[New York City]] by large margins, and carried suburban [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], but lost heavily populated [[Long Island]], part of which Lazio represented in Congress. She won surprising victories in Upstate counties, such as [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga]], [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]], and [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], to which her win has been attributed.

==Analysis of margin of victory==
In comparison with other results, this 12% margin was smaller than Gore's 25% margin over Bush in the [[United States presidential election in New York, 2000|state Presidential contest]], was slightly larger than the 10% margin by which fellow New York senator [[Charles Schumer]] defeated incumbent Republican [[Al D'Amato]] in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47% margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger [[Howard Mills]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/1998/states/NY/S/index.html | title=Election Night 1998: New York | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=1998-11-04 | accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/ny.htm | title=Kerry, Schumer win in New York | publisher=[[Associated Press]] for [[USA Today]] | date=2004-11-03 | accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref> The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, because in recent decades the Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.

Lazio's bid was handicapped by the weak performance of [[George W.

New Square had voted almost unanimously for Hillary Clinton in the New York Senate race.

A federal investigation launched to investigate various Clinton pardons,<ref name="time041401"/> closed its investigation of the New Square matter in June 2002 by taking no action against Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, or any residents of New Square.<ref name="cnn062002">{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/06/20/clinton.clemency/index.html | title=Clinton cleared in one probe of clemency grants | publisher=[[CNN.com]] | date=June 20, 2002 | accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>

[[Image:Hillary Clinton and her largest donor Peter Paul.jpg|thumb|146px|right|Hillary Clinton with her largest 2000 contributor, Peter Paul, at the [[Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton]].]]  Hillary Clinton's former finance director, [[David Rosen (politics)|David Rosen]], was indicted on January 7, 2005 on campaign finance charges related to a fund-raising event produced by [[Peter F. Paul]].  Paul, a convicted drug dealer who would soon after be convicted on stock fraud charges after being extradited from [[Brazil]], stated that he spent $1.2 million to produce the August 12, 2000 [[Hollywood Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton]] event, which was both a tribute to honor President Clinton and a fundraiser for the First Lady's 2000 Senate campaign. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] indictment charged Rosen with filing false reports with the [[Federal Election Commission]] by reporting only $400,000 in contributions. On May 27, 2005, the jury acquitted Rosen on all counts.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050527/ap_on_re_us/clinton_fundraising_probe | title=~ Clinton Fundraising Probe | publisher=[[Associated Press]] for [[Yahoo!

Meanwhile, by the time of [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign]], a 13-minute video produced by Paul and describing his various allegations against Hillary Clinton had become quite popular on the Internet, gaining 1.4 million hits on [[Google Video]] and about 350,000 on [[YouTube]] in a single week in October 2007.<ref name="ap102907">{{cite news | url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gUtFgO8foY5-Gy8CFMqcRyGxtxJQD8SJ7AV00 | title=Anti-Clinton Video Draws Attention | author=Jim Kuhnhenn | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=2007-10-29 | accessdate=2007-11-01}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Clinton's victory would establish her as an effective campaigner and an electoral force on her own, able to capture Republican and independent votes and overcome her polarizing image.<ref name="nyt110900an"/>  She would [[United States Senate election in New York, 2006|easily win re-election in 2006]], and in 2007 began [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|her presidential campaign for 2008]].

Lazio gave up his House seat to run for Senate.  Following his defeat, which set a record for the most money spent in a losing Senate effort,<ref name="nyt121300"/> he took positions in the corporate world and avoided electoral politics until becoming a candidate for in [[New York gubernatorial election, 2010|New York's 2010 gubernatorial election]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://capitalnews9.com/region12content/top_stories/482987/lazio-expected-to-announce-candidacy-for-governor/ | title=Lazio announces candidacy for governor | author= | publisher=[[Capital News 9]] | date=2009-09-21 | accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref>

Giuliani would undergo treatment for his cancer and eventually recover; he would also divorce Donna Hanover and eventually marry Judith Nathan.  After his campaign withdrawal, his political future looked uncertain at best.<ref name="salon112707"/>  But less than a year after the senate general election, the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] took place, with Giuliani still mayor.  Giuliani's performance in the aftermath of September 11 earned him many accolades and resurrected his political prospects.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/11/08/skills_at_ready_when_crisis_struck/?page=full | author=Brian C.

Throughout much of 2007, Clinton and Giuliani led in national polls for their parties' respective nominations, and media reports often looked back to the 2000 "race that wasn't" as a preview of what might lie in wait for the entire nation in 2008.<ref name="salon112707"/><ref name="nyt112807"/>  Such extrapolating ended with the Giuliani campaign's precipitous decline and January 2008 withdrawal. Clinton as well failed to gain the 2008 nomination and, in June 2008, she finished in a close second place to Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]].

In December 2008, Lowey would have another chance at the Senate seat, when Clinton was nominated for [[U.S. Secretary of State]] by President-elect Obama and Lowey was considered a front-runner to be named as her appointed replacement.<ref name="pol120108">{{cite news | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/1208/Lowey_doesnt_want_Clintons_Senate_seat.html | title=Lowey withdraws from race to replace Clinton | author=Thrush, Glenn | publisher=''[[The Politico]]'' | date=2008-12-01 | accessdate=2008-12-05}}</ref>  But Lowey withdrew from consideration, as in the intervening years she had gained enough seniority to become one of the powerful "cardinals" on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] and did not want to relinquish that position.<ref name="pol120108"/>  When [[Caroline Kennedy]] announced her interest in the vacancy, comparisons were drawn to Clinton in 2000, with both being famous people seeking to hold elective office for the first time.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/18/caroline-kennedy-senate-profile | title=Caroline Kennedy: Born survivor makes Senate bid | author=Goldenberg, Suzanne | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | date=2008-12-18 | accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  Others pointed out that Clinton had won election to the office while Kennedy would first be appointed.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2008/12/16/kennedy_clinton/ | title=Why Caroline Kennedy is not Hillary Clinton | author=Koppelman, Alex | publisher=''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' | date=2008-12-16 | accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  In any case, Kennedy's effort soon faltered, in part due to not having the same desire or willingness to work for the seat as Clinton had had,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/choice-of-kennedy-for-senate-no-longer-seems-inevitable | title=Choice of Kennedy for Senate No Longer Seems Inevitable | author=Lee, Jennifer 8. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2008-12-31 | accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> and she soon withdrew as abruptly as she had entered.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/choice-of-kennedy-for-senate-no-longer-seems-inevitable | title=Caroline Kennedy officially withdraws from race for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's Senate seat | author=Lovett, Kenneth | publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]'' | date=2009-01-22 | accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>
