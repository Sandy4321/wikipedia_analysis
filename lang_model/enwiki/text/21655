'''HMS ''Thermopylae'' (P355)''' was a [[British T class submarine|T-class]] [[submarine]] of the United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]] laid down on [[26 October]] [[1943]] at [[Chatham Dockyard]], and launched on [[27 June]] [[1945]].  So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name ''Thermopylae'', after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].

Commissioned after the end of the [[Second World War]], she had a relatively quiet career.  She immediately joined the 3rd [[Flotilla]] based in the [[Holy Loch]].

She remained in service until December 1968 when she was put on the sale list. She was broken up at [[Troon]] during 1971.<ref>[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/3379.html HMS Thermopylae], Uboat.net</ref>
