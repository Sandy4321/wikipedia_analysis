A '''thermal power station''' is a [[power plant]] in which the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]] is [[steam]] driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a [[steam turbine]] which drives an [[electrical generator]]. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is [[Condensation|condensed]] in a [[Surface condenser|condenser]] and recycled to where it was heated; this is known as a [[Rankine cycle]]. The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different fuel sources. Some prefer to use the term ''energy center'' because such facilities convert forms of [[heat]] [[energy]] into electricity.<ref>[http://indianpowersector.com/2010/10/electricity/ Electricity]</ref> Some thermal power plants also deliver heat energy for industrial purposes, for [[district heating]], or for [[desalination]] of water as well as delivering electrical power. A large part of human  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions comes from fossil fueled thermal power plants; efforts to reduce these outputs are various and widespread.

==Introductory overview==
Almost all [[coal]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[solar thermal electric]], and [[incineration|waste incineration plants]], as well as many natural gas power plants are thermal. [[Natural gas]] is frequently [[Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|combusted]] in [[gas turbine]]s as well as [[boiler]]s.  The [[waste heat]] from a gas turbine can be used to raise steam, in a [[combined cycle]] plant that improves overall efficiency.  Power plants burning coal, [[fuel oil]], or natural gas are often called ''[[fossil-fuel power plant]]s''.  Some [[biomass]]-fueled thermal power plants have appeared also.  Non-nuclear thermal power plants, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use [[co-generation]] are sometimes referred to as ''conventional power plants''.  

Commercial [[electric utility]] power stations are usually constructed on a large scale and designed for continuous operation.  Electric power plants typically use [[three-phase]]  [[electrical generator]]s to produce alternating current (AC) electric power at a [[Utilty frequency|frequency]] of 50&nbsp;Hz or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]].  Large companies or institutions may have their own power plants to supply [[heating]] or electricity to their facilities, especially if steam is created anyway for other purposes.  Steam-driven power plants have been used in various large ships, but are now usually used in large [[navy|naval]] ships.  Shipboard power plants usually directly couple the turbine to the ship's propellers through gearboxes. Power plants in such ships also provide steam to smaller turbines driving electric generators to supply electricity.  Shipboard steam power plants can be either fossil fuel or nuclear.  [[Nuclear marine propulsion]] is, with few exceptions, used only in naval vessels.  There have been perhaps about a dozen [[turbo-electric]] ships in which a steam-driven turbine drives an electric generator which powers an [[electric motor]] for [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]].  

[[Combined heat and power plant|''combined heat and power'' (CH&P) plants]], often called ''co-generation plants'', produce both electric power and heat for process heat or space heating.  Steam and hot water lose energy when piped over substantial distance, so carrying heat energy by steam or hot water is often only worthwhile within a local area, such as a ship, industrial plant, or [[district heating]] of nearby buildings.

==History==
Reciprocating steam engines have been used for mechanical power sources since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by [[James Watt]].  The very first commercial central electrical generating stations in the [[Pearl Street Station]], New York and the [[Holborn Viaduct power station]], London,  in 1882,  also used reciprocating steam engines.  The development of the [[steam turbine]] allowed larger and more efficient central generating stations to be built.  By 1892 it was considered as an alternative to reciprocating engines <ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=ZMw7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA175&dq=central+station+steam+engine+turbine&hl=en&ei=uzfQTKX9EsKXnAfF2cSNBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=central%20station%20steam%20engine%20turbine&f=false ''The early days of the power station industry'', Cambridge University Press Archive, pages 174-175</ref> Turbines offered higher speeds, more compact machinery, and stable speed regulation allowing for parallel synchronous operation of generators on a common bus. Turbines entirely replaced reciprocating engines in large central stations after about 1905. The largest reciprocating engine-generator sets ever built were completed in 1901 for the Manhattan Elevated Railway. Each of seventeen units weighed about 500 tons and was rated 6000 kilowatts; a contemporary turbine-set of similar rating would have weighed about 20% as much.<ref>Maury Klein, ''The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America'' Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2009 ISBN 159691677X</ref>

==Efficiency==
The energy efficiency of a conventional thermal power station, considered as salable energy  as a percent of the [[heating value]] of the fuel consumed, is typically 33% to 48%. This efficiency is limited as all heat engines are governed by the laws of [[thermodynamic]]s. The rest of the energy must leave the plant in the form of heat. This [[waste heat]] can go through a [[Surface condenser|condenser]] and be disposed of with [[cooling water]] or in [[cooling tower]]s. If the waste heat is instead utilized for [[district heating]], it is called [[co-generation]]. An important class of thermal power station are associated with [[desalination]] facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of [[natural gas]] and in these plants, freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products. [[Image:feedwater-heating.png|thumb|right|354px|A [[Rankine cycle]] with a two-stage [[steam turbine]] and a single feed water heater.]]

Above the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] for [[Water (data page)|water]] of {{convert|705|F|C}} and 3212 psi (22.06 MPa), there is no [[phase transition]] from water to steam, but only a gradual decrease in [[density]]. [[Boiling]] does not occur and it is not possible to remove impurities via steam separation. In this case a super critical steam plant is required to utilize the increased [[thermodynamic efficiency]] by operating at higher temperatures. These plants, also called ''once-through'' plants because boiler water does not circulate multiple times, require additional water purification steps to ensure that any impurities picked up during the cycle will be removed. This purification takes the form of high pressure ion exchange units called [[condensate polisher]]s between the steam condenser and the feed water heaters. Sub-critical fossil fuel power plants can achieve 36<U+2013>40% efficiency. [[Super critical fluid|Super critical]] designs have efficiencies in the low to mid 40% range, with new "ultra critical" designs using pressures of 4400 psi (30.3 MPa) and dual stage reheat reaching about 48% efficiency.

Current [[nuclear power plant]]s operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal-fired plants do. This limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 30<U+2013>32%. Some advanced reactor designs being studied, such as the [[Very high temperature reactor]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor]] and [[Super critical water reactor]], would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants, producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency.

==Electricity cost==
{{see also|Relative cost of electricity generated by different sources}}
The direct cost of electric energy produced by a thermal power station is the result of cost of fuel, capital cost for the plant, operator labour, maintenance, and such factors as ash handling and disposal. Indirect, social or environmental costs such as the economic value of environmental impacts, or environmental and health effects of the complete fuel cycle and plant decommissioning,  are not usually assigned to generation costs for thermal stations in utility practice, but may form part of an environmental impact assessment.

For units over about 200 [[megawatt|MW]] capacity, redundancy of key components is provided by installing duplicates of the forced and induced draft fans, air preheaters, and fly ash collectors. On some units of about 60&nbsp;MW, two boilers per unit may instead be provided.

==Boiler  and steam cycle==

In fossil-fueled power plants, ''[[Boiler (steam generator)|steam generator]]'' refers to a furnace that burns the fossil fuel to boil water to generate steam.  

In the [[Nuclear power|nuclear plant]] field, ''[[Steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generator]]'' refers to a specific type of large [[heat exchanger]] used in a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) to thermally connect the primary (reactor plant) and secondary (steam plant) systems, which  generates steam.  In a nuclear reactor called a [[boiling water reactor]] (BWR), water is boiled to generate steam directly in the reactor itself and there are no units called steam generators.  

In some industrial settings, there can also be steam-producing heat exchangers called ''heat recovery steam generators'' (HRSG) which utilize heat from some industrial process.  The steam generating boiler has to produce steam at the high purity, pressure and temperature required for the steam turbine that drives the electrical generator. 

[[Geothermal power|Geothermal plants]] need no boiler since they use naturally occurring steam sources. Heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids. 

A fossil fuel steam generator includes an [[economizer]], a [[steam drum]], and the [[furnace]] with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary [[safety valve]]s are located at suitable points to avoid excessive boiler pressure. The air and [[flue gas]] path equipment include: forced draft (FD) [[Centrifugal fan|fan]], [[Air Preheater]] (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors ([[electrostatic precipitator]] or [[dust collector#Fabric filters|baghouse]]) and the [[flue gas stack]].<ref>{{cite book|author=British Electricity International|title=Modern Power Station Practice: incorporating modern power system practice|edition=3rd Edition (12 volume set)|publisher=Pergamon|year=1991|isbn=0-08-040510-X}}</ref><ref name=Babcock>{{cite book|author=Babcock & Wilcox Co.|title=Steam: Its Generation and Use|edition=41st edition|year=2005|isbn=0-9634570-0-4}}</ref><ref name=Elliott>{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Elliott, Kao Chen, Robert Swanekamp (coauthors)|title=Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering|edition=2nd edition|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|isbn=0-07-019435-1}}</ref>

===Feed water heating and deaeration===
The feed water used in the [[steam]] boiler is a means of transferring heat energy from the burning fuel to the mechanical energy of the spinning [[steam turbine]]. The total feed water consists of recirculated  ''condensate'' water and purified ''makeup water''. Because the metallic materials it contacts are subject to [[corrosion]] at high temperatures and pressures, the makeup water is highly purified before use. A system of [[water softener]]s and [[ion exchange]] demineralizers produces water so pure that it coincidentally becomes an electrical [[Electrical insulation|insulator]], with [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] in the range of 0.3<U+2013>1.0 [[Siemens (unit)#Definition|microsiemens]] per centimeter. The makeup water in a 500&nbsp;MWe plant amounts to perhaps 20 US gallons per minute (1.25 L/s) to offset the small losses from steam leaks in the system.

The feed water cycle begins with condensate water being pumped out of the [[Surface condenser|condenser]] after traveling through the steam turbines. The condensate flow rate at full load in a 500&nbsp;MW plant is about 6,000 US gallons per minute (400 L/s).
[[Image:Deaerator.png|thumb|391 px|right|Diagram of boiler feed water deaerator (with vertical, domed aeration section and horizontal water storage section).]]
The water flows through a series of six or seven intermediate [[feed water heater]]s, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, the condensate plus the makeup water then flows through a [[deaerator]]<ref name=Spirax>[http://www.spiraxsarco.com/resources/steam-engineering-tutorials/the-boiler-house/pressurised-deaerators.asp#head5 Pressurized deaerators]</ref><ref>[http://www.usfilter.com/NR/rdonlyres/27278F1E-8378-404B-B0F2-1C9CDCAABB20/0/trey_deaerator_brochure.pdf Tray deaerating heaters]</ref> that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with [[hydrazine]], a chemical that removes the remaining [[oxygen]] in the water to below 5 [[parts per billion]] (ppb).{{Vague|by what?--follow the link|date=February 2010}} It is also dosed with [[pH]] control agents such as [[ammonia]] or [[morpholine]] to keep the residual [[acid]]ity low and thus non-corrosive.

===Boiler operation===
The boiler is a rectangular [[furnace]] about {{convert|50|ft|m}} on a side and {{convert|130|ft|m}} tall. Its walls are made of a web of high pressure steel tubes about {{convert|2.3|in|mm}} in diameter.

[[Coal dust|Pulverized coal]] is air-blown into the furnace from fuel nozzles at the four corners and it rapidly burns, forming a large fireball at the center. The [[thermal radiation]] of the fireball heats the water that circulates through the boiler tubes near the boiler perimeter. The water circulation rate in the boiler is three to four times the throughput and is typically driven by pumps. As the water in the [[boiler]] circulates it absorbs heat and changes into steam at {{convert|700|F|C||sigfig=2}} and {{convert|3200|psi|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. It is separated from the water inside a drum at the top of the furnace. The saturated steam is introduced into [[superheat]] pendant tubes that hang in the hottest part of the combustion gases as they exit the furnace. Here the steam is superheated to {{convert|1000|F|C|sigfig=2}} to prepare it for the turbine.

Plants designed for [[lignite]] (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations as varied as [[Germany]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[North Dakota]]. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and [[coal ash|ash]], yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler.

Plants that use gas turbines to heat the water for conversion into steam use boilers known as [[heat recovery steam generator]]s (HRSG). The exhaust heat from the gas turbines is used to make superheated steam that is then used in a conventional water-steam generation cycle, as described in [[Fossil fuel power plant#Gas turbine combined-cycle plants|gas turbine combined-cycle plants]] section below.

===Boiler furnace and steam drum===
Once water inside the [[boiler]] or [[steam generator]], the process of adding the [[latent heat of vaporization]] or [[enthalpy]] is underway. The boiler transfers energy to the water by the chemical reaction of burning some type of fuel.  

The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the [[economizer]]. From the economizer it passes to the [[steam drum]]. Once the water enters the steam drum it goes down to the lower inlet water wall headers. From the inlet headers the water rises through the water walls and is eventually turned into steam due to the heat being generated by the burners located on the front and rear water walls (typically). As the water is turned into steam/vapor in the water walls, the steam/vapor once again enters the steam drum. The steam/vapor is passed through a series of steam and water separators and then dryers inside the steam drum.  The [[steam separator]]s and dryers remove water droplets from the steam and the cycle through the water walls is repeated. This process is known as [[natural circulation]].

The boiler furnace auxiliary equipment includes [[coal]] feed nozzles and igniter guns, [[soot blower]]s, water lancing and observation ports (in the furnace walls) for observation of the furnace interior. Furnace [[explosion]]s due to any accumulation of combustible gases after a trip-out are avoided by flushing out such gases from the combustion zone before igniting the coal.

The steam drum (as well as the super heater coils and headers) have air vents and drains needed for initial start up. The steam drum has internal devices that removes moisture from the wet steam entering the drum from the steam generating tubes. The dry steam then flows into the super heater coils.

===Superheater===
Fossil fuel power plants can have a superheater and/or re-heater section in the steam generating furnace.   In a fossil fuel plant, after the steam is conditioned by the drying equipment inside the steam drum, it is piped from the upper drum area into tubes inside an area of the furnace known as the superheater, which has an elaborate set up of tubing where the steam vapor picks up more energy from hot flue gases outside the tubing and its temperature is now superheated above the saturation temperature.  The superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves before the high pressure turbine.

Nuclear-powered steam plants do not have such sections but produce steam at essentially saturated conditions. Experimental nuclear plants were equipped with fossil-fired super heaters in an attempt to improve overall plant operating cost.

===Steam condensing===
The condenser condenses the steam from the exhaust of the turbine into liquid to allow it to be pumped. If the condenser can be made cooler, the pressure of the exhaust steam is reduced and efficiency of the [[Rankine cycle|cycle]] increases.

[[Image:Surface Condenser.png|thumb|right|354px|Diagram of a typical water-cooled surface condenser.<ref name="Babcock"/><ref name="Elliott"/><ref name="epa.gov">[http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/eog/course422/ce6b3.html Air Pollution Control Orientation Course] from website of the Air Pollution Training Institute</ref><ref name="Energy savings in steam systems">[http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf Energy savings in steam systems] ''Figure 3a, Layout of surface condenser'' (scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages)</ref>]]

The surface condenser is a [[shell and tube heat exchanger]] in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes.<ref name="Babcock"/><ref name="epa.gov"/><ref name="Energy savings in steam systems"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Thurston Kent (Editor in Chief)|title=Kents<U+2019> Mechanical Engineers<U+2019> Handbook|edition=Eleventh edition (Two volumes)|publisher=John Wiley & Sons (Wiley Engineering Handbook Series)|year=1936|id=}}</ref> The exhaust steam from the low pressure turbine enters the shell where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes as shown in the adjacent diagram. Such condensers use [[Injector|steam ejector]]s or [[rotary motor]]-driven [[exhausters]] for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain [[vacuum]]. 

For best efficiency, the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam.  Since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100 <U+00B0>C where the [[vapor pressure]] of water is much less than atmospheric pressure, the condenser generally works under [[vacuum]]. Thus leaks of non-condensible air into the closed loop must be prevented.  

Typically the cooling water causes the steam to condense at a temperature of about {{convert|35|C|F}} and that creates an [[absolute pressure]] in the condenser of about {{convert|2|-|7|kPa|inHg|abbr=on|l K = on}}, i.e. a [[vacuum]] of about {{convert|-95|kPa|inHg|abbr=on}} relative to atmospheric pressure. The large decrease in volume that occurs when water vapor condenses to liquid creates the low vacuum that helps pull steam through and increase the efficiency of the turbines. 

The limiting factor is the temperature of the cooling water and that, in turn, is limited by the prevailing average climatic conditions at the power plant's location (it may be possible to lower the temperature beyond the turbine limits during winter, causing excessive condensation in the turbine). Plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer; unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for [[air conditioning]]. 

The condenser generally uses either circulating cooling water from a [[cooling tower]] to reject waste heat to the atmosphere, or once-through water from a river, lake or ocean.
[[Image:A Marley industrial cooling tower.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A Marley mechanical induced draft cooling tower]]The heat absorbed by the circulating cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain the ability of the water to cool as it circulates. This is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either natural draft, forced draft or induced draft [[cooling tower]]s (as seen in the image to the right) that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation, by about 11&nbsp;to&nbsp;17 <U+00B0>C (20&nbsp;to&nbsp;30 <U+00B0>F)<U+2014>expelling [[waste heat]] to the atmosphere. The circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500 [[MW]] unit is about 14.2 m<U+00B3>/s (500&nbsp;ft<U+00B3>/s or 225,000 US gal/min) at full load.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/ostwater/presentations/maulbetsch.pdf EPA Workshop on Cooling Water Intake Technologies Arlington, Virginia] John Maulbetsch, Maulbetsch Consulting Kent Zammit, EPRI. 6 May 2003. Retrieved 10 September 2006.</ref>

The condenser tubes are made of [[brass]] or [[stainless steel]] to resist corrosion from either side. Nevertheless they may become internally fouled during operation by bacteria or algae in the cooling water or by mineral scaling, all of which inhibit heat transfer and reduce [[thermodynamic efficiency]]. Many plants include an automatic cleaning system that circulates sponge rubber balls through the tubes to scrub them clean without the need to take the system off-line.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The cooling water used to condense the steam in the condenser returns to its source without having been changed other than having been warmed. If the water returns to a local water body (rather than a circulating cooling tower), it is tempered with cool 'raw' water to prevent thermal shock when discharged into that body of water.

Another form of condensing system is the air-cooled condenser. The process is similar to that of a [[radiator]] and fan. Exhaust heat from the low pressure section of a steam turbine runs through the condensing tubes, the tubes are usually finned and ambient air is pushed through the fins with the help of a large fan. The steam condenses to water to be reused in the water-steam cycle. Air-cooled condensers typically operate at a higher temperature than water-cooled versions. While saving water, the efficiency of the cycle is reduced (resulting in more carbon dioxide per megawatt of electricity).

From the bottom of the condenser, powerful [[condensate pump]]s recycle the condensed steam (water) back to the water/steam cycle.

===Reheater===
Power plant furnaces may have a reheater section containing tubes heated by hot flue gases outside the tubes.  Exhaust steam from the high pressure turbine is passed through these heated tubes to collect more energy before driving the intermediate and then low pressure turbines.

===Air path===
External fans are provided to give sufficient air for combustion. The Primary air fan takes air from the atmosphere and, first warming it in the air preheater for better combustion, injects it via the air nozzles on the furnace wall. 

The induced draft fan assists the FD fan by drawing out combustible gases from the furnace, maintaining a slightly negative pressure in the furnace to avoid backfiring through any opening.

==Steam turbine generator==
{{Main|Turbo generator}}

[[Image:Dampfturbine Laeufer01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rotor of a modern steam turbine, used in a power station]]
The turbine generator consists of a series of steam [[turbine]]s interconnected to each other and a generator on a common shaft. There is a high pressure turbine at one end, followed by an intermediate pressure turbine, two low pressure turbines, and the generator. As steam moves through the system and loses pressure and thermal energy it expands in volume, requiring increasing diameter and longer blades at each succeeding stage to extract the remaining energy. The entire rotating mass may be over 200 metric tons and {{convert|100|ft|m|sigfig=1}} long. It is so heavy that it must be kept turning slowly even when shut down (at 3 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]) so that the shaft will not bow even slightly and become unbalanced. This is so important that it is one of only five functions of blackout emergency power batteries on site. Other functions are [[emergency lighting]], [[communication]], station alarms and turbogenerator lube oil.

Superheated steam from the boiler is delivered through {{convert|14|-|16|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter piping to the high pressure turbine where it falls in pressure to {{convert|600|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} and to {{convert|600|F|C|-1}} in temperature through the stage. It exits via {{convert|24|-|26|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter cold reheat lines and passes back into the boiler where the steam is reheated in special reheat pendant tubes back to {{convert|1000|F|C|-2}}. The hot reheat steam is conducted to the intermediate pressure turbine where it falls in both [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] and exits directly to the long-bladed low pressure turbines and finally exits to the condenser.

The generator, {{convert|30|ft|m|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|12|ft|m}} in diameter, contains a stationary [[stator]] and a spinning [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]], each containing miles of heavy [[copper]] conductor<U+2014>no permanent [[magnet]]s here. In operation it generates up to 21,000 [[ampere]]s at 24,000 [[volt]]s [[Alternating current|AC]] (504&nbsp;MWe) as it spins at either 3,000 or 3,600 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], synchronized to the [[power grid]]. The rotor spins in a sealed chamber cooled with [[hydrogen]] gas, selected because it has the highest known [[heat transfer coefficient]] of any gas and for its low [[viscosity]] which reduces [[windage]] losses. This system requires special handling during startup, with air in the chamber first displaced by [[carbon dioxide]] before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly [[explosive]] hydrogen<U+2013>[[oxygen]] environment is not created.

The [[utility frequency|power grid frequency]] is 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] across [[North America]] and 50&nbsp;Hz in [[Europe]], [[Oceania]], [[Asia]] ([[Korea]] and parts of [[Japan]] are notable exceptions) and parts of [[Africa]].

The electricity flows to a distribution yard where [[transformer]]s increase  the voltage for transmission to its destination.

The [[Turbo generator|steam turbine-driven generators]] have auxiliary systems enabling them to work satisfactorily and safely. The steam turbine generator being rotating equipment generally has a heavy, large diameter shaft. The shaft therefore requires not only supports but also has to be kept in position while running. To minimize the frictional resistance to the rotation, the shaft has a number of [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. The bearing shells, in which the shaft rotates, are lined with a low friction material like [[Babbitt metal]]. Oil lubrication is provided to further reduce the friction between shaft and bearing surface and to limit the heat generated.

==Stack gas path and cleanup==
{{See also|Flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion|Flue-gas desulfurization}}

As the combustion [[flue gas]] exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates, This is called the [[air preheater]]. The gas exiting the boiler is laden with [[fly ash]], which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains [[nitrogen]] along with combustion products [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], and [[nitrogen oxide]]s. The fly ash is removed by [[Dust collector#Types of baghouses|fabric bag filter]]s or [[electrostatic precipitator]]s. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes be used in the manufacturing of [[concrete]]. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power plants in the world do not have these facilities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power plants.

Where required by law, the sulfur and nitrogen oxide [[pollutant]]s are removed by [[flue-gas desulfurization|stack gas scrubber]]s which use a pulverized [[limestone]] or other [[alkaline]] wet slurry to remove those pollutants from the exit stack gas. Other devices use catalysts to remove Nitrous Oxide compounds from the flue gas stream.  The gas travelling up the [[flue gas stack]] may by this time have dropped to about {{convert|50|C|F|-1}}. A typical flue gas stack may be {{convert|150|-|180|m|ft|sigfig=2}} tall to disperse the remaining flue gas components in the atmosphere. The tallest flue gas stack in the world is {{convert|419.7|m|ft|sigfig=4}} tall at the [[GRES-2 Power Station|GRES-2]] power plant in [[Ekibastuz]], [[Kazakhstan]].

The United States also requires the height of a flue gas stack to comply with what is known as the "[[Good Engineering Practice]] (GEP)" stack height.<ref>''Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised'', 1985, EPA Publication No. EPA<U+2013>450/4<U+2013>80<U+2013>023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85<U+2013>225241)</ref><ref>Lawson, Jr., R. E. and W. H. Snyder, 1983. ''Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height: A Demonstration Study for a Power Plant'', 1983, EPA Publication No. EPA<U+2013>600/3<U+2013>83<U+2013>024. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83<U+2013>207407)</ref>  In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modeling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height.

===Fly ash collection===

[[Fly ash]] is captured and removed from the flue gas by electrostatic precipitators or fabric bag filters (or sometimes both) located at the outlet of the furnace and before the induced draft fan. The fly ash is periodically removed from the collection hoppers below the precipitators or bag filters. Generally, the fly ash is pneumatically transported to storage silos for subsequent transport by trucks or railroad cars  .

=== Bottom ash collection and disposal ===

At the bottom of the furnace, there is a hopper for collection of [[bottom ash]].  This hopper is always filled with water to quench the ash and clinkers falling down from the furnace. Some arrangement is included to crush the clinkers and for conveying the crushed clinkers and bottom ash to a storage site  .

==Auxiliary systems==
===Boiler make-up water treatment plant and storage===
Since there is continuous withdrawal of steam and continuous return of [[Condensation|condensate]] to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages have to be made up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] salts which impart [[water hardness|hardness]] to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers.   Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form pure water. Very pure DM water becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen. 

The capacity of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a storage tank is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The storage tank for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided on top of the water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the [[surface condenser]] (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.

===Fuel preparation system===
In coal-fired power stations, the raw feed coal from the coal storage area is first crushed into small pieces and then conveyed to the coal feed hoppers at the boilers. The coal is next [[pulverizers|pulverized]] into a very fine powder. The pulverizers may be [[ball mill]]s, rotating drum [[Grinder (milling)|grinder]]s, or other types of grinders.

Some power stations burn [[fuel oil]] rather than coal. The oil must kept warm (above its [[pour point]]) in the fuel oil storage tanks to prevent the oil from congealing and becoming unpumpable. The oil is usually heated to about 100 <U+00B0>C before being pumped through the furnace fuel oil spray nozzles.

Boilers in some power stations use [[Natural gas processing|processed natural gas]] as their main fuel. Other power stations may use processed natural gas as auxiliary fuel in the event that their main fuel supply (coal or oil) is interrupted. In such cases, separate gas burners are provided on the boiler furnaces.

===Barring gear ===
[[Corliss steam engine#Barring and barring engines|Barring gear]] (or "turning gear") is the mechanism provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft at a very low speed after unit stoppages. Once the unit is "tripped" (i.e., the steam inlet valve is closed), the turbine coasts down towards standstill. When it stops completely, there is a tendency for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in the top half of the casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches.

This small shaft deflection, only detectable by eccentricity meters, would be enough to cause damaging vibrations to the entire steam turbine generator unit when it is restarted. The shaft is therefore automatically turned at low speed (about one percent rated speed) by the barring gear until it has cooled sufficiently to permit a complete stop.

===Oil system===
An auxiliary oil system pump is used to supply oil at the start-up of the steam turbine generator. It supplies the hydraulic oil system required for steam turbine's main inlet steam stop valve,  the governing control valves, the bearing and seal oil systems, the relevant hydraulic relays and other mechanisms.

At a preset speed of the turbine during start-ups, a pump driven by the turbine main shaft takes over the functions of the auxiliary system.

===Generator cooling ===
While small generators may be cooled by air drawn through filters at the inlet, larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. [[Hydrogen]] gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used because it has the highest known [[heat transfer coefficient]] of any gas and for its low [[viscosity]] which reduces [[windage]] losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by [[carbon dioxide]] before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly [[flammable]] hydrogen does not mix with [[oxygen]] in the air. 

The hydrogen pressure inside the casing is maintained slightly higher than [[atmospheric pressure]] to avoid outside air ingress. The hydrogen must be sealed against outward leakage where the shaft emerges from the casing. Mechanical seals around the shaft are installed with a very small annular gap to avoid rubbing between the shaft and the seals. Seal oil is used to prevent the hydrogen gas leakage to atmosphere.

The generator also uses water cooling. Since the generator coils are at a potential of about 22 [[kilovolt|kV]], an insulating barrier such as Teflon is used to interconnect the water line and the generator high voltage windings. Demineralized water of low conductivity is used.

===Generator high voltage system===
The generator voltage for modern utility-connected generators ranges from {{nowrap|11 kV}} in smaller units to {{nowrap|22 kV}} in larger units. The generator high voltage leads are normally large aluminium channels because of their high current as compared to the cables used in smaller machines. They are enclosed in well-grounded aluminium bus ducts and are supported on suitable insulators. The generator high voltage leads are connected to step-up [[transformer]]s for connecting to a high voltage [[electrical substation]] (usually in the range of 115 kV to 765 kV) for further transmission by the local power grid. 

The necessary [[Protection relay|protection and metering devices]] are included for the high voltage leads. Thus, the steam turbine generator and the transformer form one unit. Smaller units,may share a common generator step-up transformer with individual circuit breakers to connect the generators to a common bus.

===Monitoring and alarm system===
Most of the power plant operational controls are automatic. However, at times, manual intervention may be required. Thus, the plant is provided with monitors and alarm systems that alert the plant operators when certain operating parameters are seriously deviating from their normal range.

===Battery supplied emergency lighting and communication===
A central battery system consisting of [[lead acid battery|lead acid cell]] units  is provided to supply emergency electric power, when needed, to essential items such as the power plant's control systems, communication systems, turbine lube oil pumps, and emergency lighting. This is essential for a safe, damage-free shutdown of the units in an emergency situation.

==Transport of coal fuel to site and to storage==
{{Main|Fossil fuel power plant}}

Most thermal stations use coal as the main fuel. Raw coal is transported from [[Coal mining|coal mines]] to a power station site by [[truck]]s, [[barge]]s, [[Collier (ship type)|bulk cargo ships]] or [[railway]] cars. Generally, when shipped by railways, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes. The railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary dumpers or side tilt dumpers to tip over onto conveyor belts below. The coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about {{convert|3/4|in}} size. The crushed coal is then sent by belt conveyors to a storage pile. Normally, the crushed coal is compacted by bulldozers, as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition. 

The crushed coal is conveyed from the storage pile to silos or hoppers at the boilers by another belt conveyor system.
