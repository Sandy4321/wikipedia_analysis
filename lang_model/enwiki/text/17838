The '''Blue Lady''' is the [[ghost]] of a woman who is seen in and around the Moss Beach Distillery Cafe in [[Moss Beach, California]]; she is so-named because she usually dressed all in blue. She is said to be from the wild days of [[Prohibition]].

==Background==
When the Distillery (known in its early years as "Frank's Place", after its builder and owner, Frank Torres) was first built in 1927, it was one of the main receivers of alcohol that was smuggled into California from ships that supplied liquor from Canada; following Prohibition, the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] area, among other places in the United States, smuggled alcohol into the country in any way possible. As Frank's Place was located on an isolated bluff and was a classy restaurant, it was allegedly never raided by police.

==The mysterious lady==

It was at Frank's Place that a young woman who frequently wore blue met her fate. Very little is known about her; nobody has admitted to knowing her and thus all that has been passed down are rumors. There are many variations on the story:

The victim of an unhappy marriage, she came to Frank's Place for escape and for excitement. She ended up falling in love with a piano player and, one night, her husband caught her flirting with her lover. Her body was later found on the beach below, stabbed visciously to death.

Another version is that her husband knew nothing of her affair and that they had a son. She was killed in a car crash as she was travelling to meet up with her lover.

==The elusive ghost==

Whatever the story, the Blue Lady still frequents the Moss Beach Distillery, sometimes inside the cafe, sometimes wandering in reverie on the bluffs that overlook the sea, her clothing either bloodstained and cut or intact and clean.
