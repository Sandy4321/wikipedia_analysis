[[File:"Possible Productions knotwork" by Steve Ball.JPG|right|thumb|alt=A knotwork, a design often associated with Celtic knots. The outer design is a circle, surrounding what appears to be a triangle surrounded by a Celtic knot at first glance. Closer inspection of the triangle reveals that it is in fact an organic part of the inner knot, which seems to have two continuous segments linked by knots. At first glance, the knotwork appears to be symmetric; closer inspection reveals that the right-hand knots seem to be the reverse of the left-hand knots and there are small differences among the "twin knots"; the right and left hands of the design have variations, much as our right and left hands have subtle distinctions. The design is not symmetric with respect to 120 degree rotations: The center of the pseudo-triangle is above the center of the surrounding circle, but visual balance is maintained by extra knots below the lower pseudo<U+2013>line-segment. The background is crimson.|Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) has the policy that its artists retain all copyrights, even to DGM's knotwork&nbsp;logo.]]

'''Discipline Global Mobile''' ('''DGM''', or '''Discipline&nbsp;GM''') is an [[Independent record label|independent record label]] that was founded in 1992 by [[Robert&nbsp;Fripp]], who is known as a guitarist for [[King&nbsp;Crimson]]. DGM releases music by Fripp, KC, related acts, and other artists in compact discs and as downloadable files. A 1998 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' profile stated that DGM had ten staff members in Salisbury, England, and Los&nbsp;Angeles, California. 

DGM aims "to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed," according to Fripp.<ref name="FrippInBruns">

==Business aims==
<!-- The phrasing "Aims", and particularly "THE AIM" of a man with a plan, is characteristically Frippian. Please do not substitute "goal", etc. -->
DGM's [[mission statement]] consists of five "DGM business&nbsp;aims", which include the following three:
* firstly, "to help bring music into the world which would otherwise be unlikely" to be released unless "under conditions prejudicial to the music and/or musicians",<ref name="DGMAims" >{{cite web|url=http://www.dgmlive.com<!-- /about.htm -->|chapter=DGM business&nbsp;aims|title=About&nbsp;DGM|publisher=Discipline Global Mobile|ref=harv|accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>
* secondly, "to operate in the market&nbsp;place, while being free  of the values of the market&nbsp;place", and
* lastly, "to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded  on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed."<ref name="FrippInBruns"/><ref name="Bambarger86" >{{harvtxt|Bambarger|1998|p=86}}</ref><ref name="DGMAims"/><ref name="Atton04">{{harvtxt|Atton|2004|loc=[http://books.google.se/books?id=fZa_x8DEP_oC&pg=PA103&dq=%22Discipline+Global+Mobile%22&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q=%22Discipline%20Global%20Mobile%22%2C%20copyright&f=false Chapter&nbsp;6 "Fan culture and the Internet: Musicians and fanzines", p.&nbsp;153]}}</ref>
These aims were called "exemplary" by Martin, who wrote that "Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music" in creating DGM, and that DGM "has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for" King Crimson.<ref name="Martin269">{{harvtxt|Martin|1997|p=[http://books.google.se/books?id=APmUFlgm0R4C&dq=Prog+Rock&q=Discipline+Global+Mobile#v=snippet&q=Discipline%20Global%20Mobile&f=false 269]}}</ref>

Since at least the early 1960s, the recording industry has required artists to sign&nbsp;over [[copyright]]s and [[moral right (copyright)|moral right]]s to their cover&nbsp;art, music, and lyrics. DGM rejects this practice, and since its 1992 founding has maintained its policy that its artists retain the copyrights and the moral&nbsp;rights to their works,<ref name="Bambarger86"/><ref name="Atton04"/> be those works musical or visual art.<ref name="Atton01"/>  Fripp wrote, 
<blockquote>
"The phonographic copyright in these performances is operated by Discipline Global Mobile on behalf of the artists, with whom it resides, contrary to common practice in the record industry. Discipline accepts no reason for artists to assign the copyright interests in their work to either record company or management by virtue of a 'common practice' which was always questionable, often improper, and is now indefensible."<ref>{{harvtxt|Kozar|2012|loc=[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/150412-robert-fripp-an-appreciation/P1 "Fripp's aim was to move his music in new directions that others did not always understand", p.&nbsp;2]}}</ref>
</blockquote>
This extends even to DGM's [[Celtic knot|knotwork]] corporate logo, the copyright of which is owned not by the company, but by its designer,<ref name="Fripp98a" >{{harvtxt|Fripp|1998a|p=3}}<p>The copyright information from {{harvtxt|Fripp|1998a|p=3}} is partially reproduced at DGM&nbsp;Live!:<blockquote><p>"[https://www.dgmlive.com/ Cover Paintings 'Absent Lovers&nbsp;I&nbsp;&&nbsp;II' by P.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Crook].<p>[https://www.dgmlive.com/  Discipline Logo by Steve Ball.]<p>[https://www.dgmlive.com/  Contrary to common practice within the music and record industry, both artists own the copyright in their work.]"

==Mail-order and on-line services==
According to a 1998 profile in ''Billboard'' magazine, Discipline Global Mobile had seven staff members in Salisbury, England, and three in Los&nbsp;Angeles, California. Its label&nbsp;manager reported that the country with the largest market was Japan, where mail-orders accounted for only&nbsp;10% of sales, but&nbsp;50% of profits. In 1998, DGM was distributed in Japan by [[Pony Canyon]]; in the United Kingdom by [[Pinnacle Records|Pinnacle]];<ref name="Bambarger"/>  and in the United States by [[Rykodisc]].<ref name="Bambarger"/><ref name="Spellman"/> Sound samples have been offered in addition to DGM's mail-order services.<ref name="Bambarger"/> Free downloads from DGM have strengthened the relations between artists and fans.<ref name="Atton04"/>

In 2012, DGM's site had the following introduction: "The aim of DGM is to connect music, musician and audience in  a way that supports the power of music, the integrity of the musician  and the needs of the audience. DGM&nbsp;Live offers music  for download with photographs, diary&nbsp;archives and audience&nbsp;commentary for browsing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dgmlive.com|title=Welcome to DGM&nbsp;Live|publisher=Discipline Global Mobile|ref=harv|accessdate=25&nbsp;March&nbsp;2012}}
</ref> DGM's successful transition to an age of digital distribution was called "unique" among music labels in 2009; this success was credited to its provision of legal, high-quality recordings of concerts, which effectively [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the [[Fence (criminal)|distribution-networks]] for [[Bootleg recording|pirate&nbsp;recordings ("bootlegs")]] of concerts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anonymous|first=''Belfast Telegraph''|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-20648653.html|title=Jam and the joys of music&nbsp;distribution in today's world|newspaper=Belfast&nbsp;Telegraph|publisher=Independent News and Media PLC|year=2009|month=18 August|accessdate=14 April 2012|ref=harv|format=html|id=(subscription required)}}</ref>

DGM publishes an on-line diary by Robert&nbsp;Fripp, who often comments on performances and on relations with fans. A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, Fripp's diary and the fan&nbsp;forum display delayed&nbsp;dialogs in which Fripp and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings. Fripp's public writing of his diary has challenged his readers to become more active listeners and intelligent participants in performances of music.<ref>{{harvtxt|Atton|2001|p=43}}</ref>
