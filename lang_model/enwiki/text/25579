'''John Marshall''' (September 24, 1755 <U+2013> July 6, 1835) was the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (1801<U+2013>35) whose court opinions helped lay the basis for [[United States constitutional law|American constitutional law]] while promoting nationalism and making the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] a center of power with the capability of overruling Congress.  Previously, Marshall had been a leader of the [[Federalist Party]] in Virginia and served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1799 to 1800. He was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[John Adams]] from 1800 to 1801. 

The [[Chief Justice of the United States#List of Chief Justices|longest-serving]] Chief Justice of the United States, Marshall dominated the Court for over three decades and played a significant role in the development of the American legal system.  Most notably, he reinforced the principle that federal courts are obligated to exercise [[judicial review]], by disregarding purported laws if they violate [[United States Constitution|the Constitution]].  Thus, Marshall cemented the position of the American judiciary as an independent and influential branch of government. Furthermore, the Marshall Court made several important decisions relating to [[federalism]], affecting the balance of power between the federal government and the states during the early years of the republic. In particular, he repeatedly confirmed the supremacy of federal law over state law, and supported an expansive reading of the [[enumerated powers]].

Some of his decisions were unpopular. Nevertheless, Marshall built up the third branch of the federal government, and augmented federal power in the name of the Constitution, and the [[rule of law]].<ref>Charles F. Hobson, ''The Great Chief Justice: John Marshall and the Rule of Law'' (2000) p. 121</ref> Marshall, along with [[Daniel Webster]] (who argued some of the cases), was the leading Federalist of the day, pursuing Federalist Party approaches to build a stronger federal government over the opposition of the Jeffersonian Republicans, who wanted stronger state governments.<ref name="Jean Edward Smith 1998 p. 8">Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) p. 8</ref>

==Early years (1755 to 1782)==
John Marshall was born in a log cabin close to [[Germantown, Virginia|Germantown]], a rural community on the [[Virginia]] frontier, in what is now [[Fauquier County]] near [[Midland, Virginia]], on September 24, 1755, to Thomas Marshall and Mary Isham Keith, the granddaughter of [[Thomas Randolph of Tuckahoe]].<ref name="Connelley">{{cite book |last1=Connelley |first1=William Elsey |authorlink1= |last2=Coulter |first2=E.M. |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Charles |editor1-last=Kerr |editor1-link= |others= |title=History of Kentucky |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7DMVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume=III |date= |year=1922 |month= |origyear= |publisher=The American Historical Society |location=New York |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=122 |pages= |at= |trans_chapter= |chapter=Capt.

Also, several cousins were raised with the family. He was also relative of [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of them being descendants of Virginia colonist [[William Randolph]], though Marshall and Jefferson would oppose each other on many political issues.<ref name=Jeff>Jefferson's mother and Marshall's maternal grandmother were first cousins, because their fathers were both sons of [[William Randolph]] and Mary Isham. See Beveridge, Albert.<U+00A0>''The Life of John Marshall: Frontiersman, Soldier Lawmaker'' (Beard Books 2000).</ref> From a young age, he was noted for his good humor and black eyes, which were "strong and penetrating, beaming with intelligence and good nature".<ref>Quoted in Baker (1972), p. 4 and Stites (1981), p. 7.</ref>

Thomas Marshall was employed in Fauquier County as a surveyor and land agent by [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]], which provided Marshall with a substantial income.<ref>{{cite book|author=Smith, Jean Edward|title=John Marshall: Definer of a Nation|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=9780805055108|pages=26<U+2013>27|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9mnzC4-qfMEC&pg=PA26}}</ref>

In the early 1760s, the Marshall family left Germantown and moved some thirty miles to Leeds Manor (so named by Lord Fairfax) on the eastern slope of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]]. On the banks of Goose Creek, Thomas Marshall built a simple wooden cabin there, much like the one abandoned in Germantown with two rooms on the first floor and a two-room loft above. Thomas Marshall was not yet well established, so he leased it from Colonel [[Richard Henry Lee]]. The Marshalls called their new home "the Hollow", and the ten years they resided there were John Marshall's formative years. In 1773, the Marshall family moved once again. Thomas Marshall, by then a man of more substantial means, purchased a {{convert|1700|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate adjacent to North Cobbler Mountain, approximately ten miles northwest of the Hollow. The new farm was located adjacent to the main stage road (now U.S. 17) between Salem (the modern day village of [[Marshall, Virginia]]) and [[Delaplane, Virginia]]. When John was seventeen, Thomas Marshall built "Oak Hill" there, a seven-room frame home with four rooms on the first floor and three above. Although modest in comparison to the estates of [[George Washington]], [[James Madison]], and Thomas Jefferson,<ref>http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/journey/ohf.htm Oak Hill</ref> it was a substantial home for the period. John Marshall became the owner of Oak Hill in 1785 when his father moved to Kentucky. Although John Marshall lived his later life in [[Richmond, Virginia]] and [[Washington D.C.]], he kept his Fauquier County property, making improvements and using it as a retreat until his death.

Marshall's early education was superintended by his father who gave him an early taste for history and poetry. Thomas Marshall's employer, Lord Fairfax, allowed access to his home at [[Greenway Court]], which was an exceptional center of learning and culture. Marshall took advantage of the resources at Greenway Court and borrowed freely from the extensive collection of classical and contemporary literature. There were no schools in the region at the time, so home schooling was pursued. Although books were a rarity for most in the territory, Thomas Marshall's library was exceptional. His collection of literature, some of which was borrowed from Lord Fairfax, was relatively substantial and included works by the ancient Roman historian [[Livy]], the ancient Roman poet [[Horace]], and the English writers [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Dryden]], [[John Milton]], and [[William Shakespeare]].  All of the Marshall children were accomplished, literate, and self-educated under their parents' supervision. At the age of twelve John had transcribed Alexander Pope's ''[[An Essay on Man]]'' and some of his ''[[Moral Essays]]''.

There being no formal school in Fauqueir County at the time, John was sent, at age fourteen, about one hundred miles from home to an academy in Washington parish. Among his classmates was [[James Monroe]], the future president. John remained at the academy one year, after which he was brought home. Afterward, Thomas Marshall arranged for a minister to be sent who could double as a teacher for the local children. The Reverend James Thomson, a recently ordained deacon from [[Glasgow, Scotland]], resided with the Marshall family and tutored the children in Latin in return for his room and board. When Thomson left at the end of the year, John had begun reading and transcribing Horace and Livy.<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) p. 35</ref> 

The Marshalls had long before decided that John was to be a  lawyer. [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' had been published in America and Thomas Marshall bought a copy for his own use and for John to read and study. After John returned home from Campbell's academy he continued his studies with no other aid than his dictionary. John's father superintended the English part of his education. Marshall wrote of his father, "... and to his care I am indebted for anything valuable which I may have acquired in my youth. He was my only intelligent companion; and was both a watchful parent and an affectionate friend".<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) p. 22</ref> 

Marshall served in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was friends with George Washington. He served first as a Lieutenant in the [[Culpeper Minutemen]] from 1775 to 1776, and went on to serve as a Lieutenant and then a Captain in the Eleventh Virginia Continental Regiment from 1776 to 1780.<ref name=FJC>[http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=1486 John Marshall] at the [[Biographical Directory of Federal Judges]], a [[public domain]] publication of the [[Federal Judicial Center]].</ref><ref name=Found /> During his time in the army, he enjoyed running [[racing|races]] with the other soldiers and was nicknamed "Silverheels" for the white heels his mother had sewn into his stockings.<ref>Stites (1981), pp. 11-15.</ref>  Marshall endured the brutal winter conditions at [[Valley Forge]] (1777<U+2013>1778).<ref name=Found>"[http://www.johnmarshallfoundation.org/john-marshall/life-legacy/ Life and Legacy]", The John Marshall Foundation.</ref> After his time in the Army, he [[read law]] under the famous Chancellor [[George Wythe]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] at the [[College of William and Mary]], was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was admitted to the Bar in 1780.  He was in private practice in [[Fauquier County, Virginia]] before entering politics.<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) pp. 75-82</ref>

==Political career (1782 to 1801)==
In 1782, Marshall won a seat in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], in which he served until 1789 and again from 1795 to 1796. The [[Virginia General Assembly]] elected him to serve on the Council of State later in the same year. In 1785, Marshall took up the additional office of Recorder of the Richmond City [[Hustings]] Court.<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) p. 105</ref> 

In 1788, Marshall was selected as a delegate to the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention|Virginia convention]] responsible for ratifying or rejecting the [[United States Constitution]], which had been proposed by the [[Philadelphia Convention]] a year earlier. Together with [[James Madison]] and [[Edmund Randolph]], Marshall led the fight for ratification. He was especially active in defense of Article III, which provides for the Federal judiciary.  His most prominent opponent at the ratification convention was [[Anti-Federalist]] leader [[Patrick Henry]]. Ultimately, the convention approved the Constitution by a vote of 89-79. Marshall identified with the new [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] (which supported a strong national government and commercial interests), and opposed Jefferson's [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]] (which advocated [[states' rights]] and idealized the yeoman farmer and the [[French Revolution]]).<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall'' (1998) pp. 118-20</ref>  

Meanwhile, Marshall's private law practice continued to flourish. He successfully represented the heirs of [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] in ''[[Hite v. Fairfax]]'' (1786), an important [[Virginia Supreme Court]] case involving a large tract of land in the [[Northern Neck]] of Virginia. In 1796, he appeared before the United States Supreme Court in another important case, ''[[Ware v. Hylton]],'' a case involving the validity of a Virginia law providing for the confiscation of debts owed to British subjects. Marshall argued that the law was a legitimate exercise of the state's power; however, the Supreme Court ruled against him, holding that the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in combination with the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution required the collection of such debts.<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) p. 157</ref><ref name=Currie />

Henry Flanders in his biography of Marshall remarked that Marshall's argument in ''Ware v. Hylton'' "elicited great admiration at the time of its delivery, and enlarged the circle of his reputation." Flanders also wrote that the reader "cannot fail to be impressed with the vigor, rigorous analysis, and close reasoning that mark every sentence of it."<ref>Flanders, Henry. ''The Life of John Marshall,'' pp 38, and 30-31, Philadelphia, T. & J. W. Johnson & Co., 1905.</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ris3AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA166&dq=Ware,+administrator+of+Jones,+Plaintiff+Dallas&lr=&num=100&as_brr=1&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false  Marshall's argument at the bar  in Ware v. Hylton is here.]</ref>

In 1795, Marshall declined Washington's offer of [[Attorney General of the United States]] and, in 1796, declined to serve as minister to France. In 1797, he accepted when President [[John Adams]] appointed him to a three-member commission to represent the United States in France. (The other members of this commission were [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] and [[Elbridge Gerry]].) However, when the envoys arrived, the French refused to conduct diplomatic negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes. This diplomatic scandal became known as the [[XYZ Affair]], inflaming anti-French opinion in the United States. Hostility increased even further when the [[French Directory|Directoire]] expelled Marshall and Pinckney from France. Marshall's handling of the affair, as well as public resentment toward the French, made him popular with the American public when he returned to the United States.

In 1798, Marshall declined a Supreme Court appointment, recommending [[Bushrod Washington]], who would later become one of Marshall's staunchest allies on the Court.<ref name="Ariens">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelariens.com/ConLaw/justices/marshallj.htm|title=Ariens, Michael. "John Marshall."}}</ref> In 1799, Marshall reluctantly ran for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Although his congressional district (which included the city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]) favored the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]], Marshall won the race, in part due to his conduct during the XYZ Affair and in part due to the support of [[Patrick Henry]]. His most notable speech was related to the case of Thomas Nash (alias Jonathan Robbins), whom the government had extradited to Great Britain on charges of murder. Marshall defended the government's actions, arguing that nothing in the Constitution prevents the United States from extraditing one of its citizens.<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) pp. 258-9</ref> 

On May 7, 1799, President Adams nominated Congressman Marshall as [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]]. However, on May 12, Adams withdrew the nomination, instead naming him [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], as a replacement for [[Timothy Pickering]]. Confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on May 13, Marshall took office on June 6, 1800. As Secretary of State, Marshall directed the negotiation of the [[Convention of 1800]], which ended the [[Quasi-War]] with France and brought peace to the new nation.<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) pp. 268-86</ref>

==Chief Justice (1801 to 1835)==
Marshall served as Chief Justice during all or part of the administrations of six Presidents: [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], [[John Quincy Adams]] and [[Andrew Jackson]].  He remained a stalwart advocate of [[Federalism (United States)|Federalism]] and a nemesis of the [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] school of government throughout its heyday. He participated in over 1000 decisions, writing 519 of the opinions himself.<ref>John Edward Oster, ''The political and economic doctrines of John Marshall'' (2006) p. 348</ref><ref>Paul Johnson, ''A History of the American People,'' p. 237.</ref> 

He helped to establish the Supreme Court as the final authority on the meaning of the Constitution in cases and controversies that must be decided by the federal courts.<ref>[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/history-of-the-court/chief-justices/john-marshall-1801-1835/ John Marshall] at [[Supreme Court Historical Society]].</ref> His impact on constitutional law is without peer, and his imprint on the Court's jurisprudence remains indelible.<ref>[[Oyez.org|Oyez Project]], [http://www.oyez.org/justices/john_marshall/ Supreme Court media, John Marshall.]</ref>

===Nomination===
Marshall was thrust into the office of Chief Justice in the wake of the [[United States presidential election, 1800|presidential election of 1800]]. With the Federalists soundly defeated and about to lose both the executive and legislative branches to Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans, President Adams and the [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] Congress passed what came to be known as the [[Midnight Judges Act]], which made sweeping changes to the federal judiciary, including a reduction in the number of Justices from six to five so as to deny Jefferson an appointment until two vacancies occurred.<ref name="Stites 77-80">Stites (1981), pp. 77-80.</ref> As the incumbent Chief Justice [[Oliver Ellsworth]] was in poor health, Adams first offered the seat to ex-Chief Justice [[John Jay]], who declined on the grounds that the Court lacked "energy, weight, and dignity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/legal_entity/1/biography|title=Goldman, Jerry. "John Jay." OYEZ Project.}}</ref> Jay's letter arrived on January 20, 1801, and as there was precious little time left, Adams nominated Marshall, who was with him at the time and able to accept immediately. The Senate at first delayed, hoping that Adams would make a different choice, such as promoting Justice [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] of [[New Jersey]]. According to New Jersey Senator [[Jonathan Dayton]], the Senate finally relented "lest another not so qualified, and more disgusting to the Bench, should be substituted, and because it appeared that this gentleman [Marshall] was not privy to his own nomination".<ref>Quoted in Stites (1981), p. 80.</ref> Marshall was confirmed by the Senate on January 27, 1801, and received his commission on January 31, 1801. While Marshall officially took office on February 4, at the request of the President he continued to serve as Secretary of State until Adams' term expired on March 4.<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall: Definer of a Nation'' (1998) p. 16</ref> President John Adams offered this appraisal of Marshall's impact: "My gift of John Marshall to the people of the United States was the proudest act of my life."<ref>[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/history/supremecourthistory_history_history_marshall.htm ''The Marshall Court'', 1801-1835], Supreme Court Historical Society.</ref>

===Unified majority opinions===
Soon after becoming Chief Justice, Marshall changed the manner in which the Supreme Court announced its decisions. Previously, each Justice would author a separate opinion (known as a ''[[seriatim]]'' opinion) as is still done in the 20th and 21st centuries in such jurisdictions as the [[Law of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Law of Australia|Australia]]. Under Marshall, however, the Supreme Court adopted the practice of handing down a single opinion of the Court, allowing it to present a clear rule.<ref>[http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/pastjustices/marshall.html FindLaw Supreme Court Center: John Marshall]</ref> As Marshall was almost always the author of this opinion, he essentially became the Court's sole mouthpiece in important cases.

===Personality and leadership===
Marshall's forceful personality allowed him to steer his fellow Justices; only once did he find himself on the losing side in a constitutional case.<ref name= "Ariens" />  In that case (''[[Ogden v. Saunders]]'' in 1827), Marshall set forth his general principles of constitutional interpretation:<ref>{{Cite book | last = Currie | first = David | title = The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Hundred Years, 1789<U+2013>1888 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=AcT-ci3tfdUC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Currie+%22say+that+the+intention+of+the+instrument+must%22 | pages = 152<U+2013>5<U+00A0>| publisher = Univ. of Chicago | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780226131092 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Marshall was in the dissenting minority only eight times throughout his tenure at the Court, partly because of his influence over the associate justices. As [[Oliver Wolcott]] observed when both he and Marshall served in the Adams administration, Marshall had the knack of "putting his own ideas into the minds of others, unconsciously to them".<ref>George Gibbs, ''Memoirs of the Administrations of Washington and John Adams,'' (1846), vol. II, p. 350.</ref>  However, he regularly curbed his own viewpoints, preferring to arrive at decisions by consensus.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite document | url = http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/democracy/robes_marshall.html | last = Fox | first = John | title = Expanding Democracy, Biographies of the Robes | contribution = John Marshall | publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]] | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref> He adjusted his role to accommodate other members of the court as they developed. 

Marshall had charm, humor, a quick intelligence, and the ability to bring men together. His sincerity and presence commanded attention. His opinions were workmanlike but not especially eloquent or subtle.  His influence on learned men of the law came from the charismatic force of his personality, and his ability to seize upon the key elements of a case and make highly persuasive arguments. Together with his vision of the future greatness of the nation, these qualities are apparent in his historic decisions and gave him the sobriquet, ''The Great Chief Justice''.<ref>Smith, ''John Marshall'' pp. 351<U+2013>2, 422, 506</ref><ref>Albert Jeremiah Beveridge, ''The life of John Marshall: Volume 4'' (1919) p. 94</ref><ref>Charles F. Hobson, ''The Great Chief Justice: John Marshall and the Rule of Law'' (1996) pp. 15<U+2013>6, 119<U+2013>23; the statement to Story is on p. xiv.</ref>

Marshall ran a congenial court; there was seldom any bickering.  The Court met in Washington only two months a year, from the first Monday in February through the second or third week in March. Six months of the year the justices were doing [[Circuit rider (U.S. court system)|circuit duty]] in the various states.  Marshall was therefore based in Richmond, his hometown, for most of the year. When the Court was in session in Washington, the justices boarded together in the same rooming house, avoided outside socializing, and discussed each case intently among themselves.  Decisions were quickly made usually in a matter of days. Marshall wrote nearly half the decisions during his 33 years in office. Lawyers appearing before the court, including the most brilliant in the United States, typically gave  [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] and often did not present written briefs.  The justices did not have clerks, so they listened closely to the oral arguments, and decided among themselves what the decision should be.  The court issued only one decision; the occasional dissenter usually did not issue a separate opinion.<ref>G.  Edward White, ''The Marshall Court and Cultural Change: 1815-1835'' (abridged ed. 1991) pp 157-200</ref>  

While Marshall was very good at listening to the oral briefs, and convincing the other justices of his interpretation of the law, he was not widely read in the law, and seldom cited precedents.  After the Court came to a decision, he would usually write it up himself. Often he asked [[Joseph Story|Justice Story]], a renowned legal scholar, to do the chores of locating the precedents, saying, "There, Story; that is the law of this case; now go and find the authorities."<ref>A reliable statement of the quote was recounted by [[Theophilus Parsons (professor)|Theophilus Parsons]], a law professor who knew Marshall personally.  Parsons, "Distinguished Lawyers," [http://books.google.com/books?id=_U8ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA126&dq=marshall+justice+story+%22that+is+the+law%22&hl=en&ei=DKg8TabYGoqasAPdiIGhAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=marshall%20justice%20story%20%22that%20is%20the%20law%22&f=false ''Albany Law Journal'' Aug. 20, 1870, pp 126-7 online].  Historian Edward Corwin garbled the quote to: "Now Story, that is the law; you find the precedents for it," and that incorrect version has been repeated. Edward Corwin, ''John Marshall and the Constitution: a chronicle of the Supreme Court'' (1919) p 119.</ref>

===Impact===
The three previous chief justices ([[John Jay]], [[John Rutledge]], and [[Oliver Ellsworth]]) had left little permanent mark beyond setting up the forms of office. The Supreme Court, like many state supreme courts, was a minor organ of government. In his 34-year tenure, Marshall gave it the energy, weight, and dignity of a third co-equal branch.  With his associate justices, especially [[Joseph Story]], [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]], and [[Bushrod Washington]], Marshall's Court brought to life the constitutional standards of the new nation. 

Marshall used Federalist approaches to build a strong federal government over the opposition of the Jeffersonian Democrats, who wanted stronger state governments.<ref name="Jean Edward Smith 1998 p. 8"/>  His influential rulings reshaped American government, making the Supreme Court the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation. The Marshall Court struck down an act of Congress in only one case (''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' in 1803) but that established the Court as a center of power that could overrule the Congress, the President, the states, and all lower courts if that is what a fair reading of the Constitution required. He also defended the legal rights of corporations by tying them to the individual rights of the stockholders, thereby ensuring that corporations have the same level of protection for their property as individuals had, and shielding corporations against intrusive state governments.<ref>R. Kent Newmyer, ''John Marshall and the Heroic Age of the Supreme Court'' (2007) p. 251</ref>

===Marbury v. Madison===
''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'' (1803) was the first important case before Marshall's Court. In that case, the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of the [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] on the grounds that it violated the Constitution by attempting to expand the [[original jurisdiction]] of the Supreme Court. ''Marbury'' was the first and only case in which the Marshall Court ruled an act of Congress unconstitutional, and thereby reinforced the doctrine of [[judicial review]]. Thus, although the Court indicated that the Jefferson administration was violating another law, the Court said it could not do anything about it due to its own lack of jurisdiction. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] took the position that the Court could not give him a [[mandamus]] (i.e. an order) even if the Court had jurisdiction:

{{cquote|In the case of Marbury and Madison, the federal judges declared that commissions, signed and sealed by the President, were valid, although not delivered. I deemed delivery essential to complete a deed, which, as long as it remains in the hands of the party, is as yet no deed, it is ''in posse'' only, but not ''in esse'', and I withheld delivery of the commissions. They cannot issue a mandamus to the President or legislature, or to any of their officers.<ref name=Tom />}}

More generally, Jefferson lamented that allowing the Constitution to mean whatever the Court says it means would make the Constitution "a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please."<ref name=Tom>{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_18s16.html|title=Jefferson, Thomas. Letter to Spencer Roane.}}</ref>

Because ''Marbury v. Madison'' decided that a jurisdictional statute passed by Congress was unconstitutional, that was technically a victory for the Jefferson administration (so it could not easily complain).  Ironically what was unconstitutional was Congress' granting a certain power to the Supreme Court itself. The case allowed Marshall to proclaim the doctrine of judicial review, which reserves to the Supreme Court final authority to judge whether or not actions of the president or of the congress are within the powers granted to them by the Constitution. The Constitution itself is the supreme law, and when the Court believes that a specific law or action is in violation of it, the Court must uphold the Constitution and set aside that other law or action, assuming that a party has [[standing]] to properly invoke the Court's jurisdiction. Chief Justice Marshall famously put the matter this way:

{{cquote|It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is. Those who apply the rule to particular cases must, of necessity, expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with each other, the Courts must decide on the operation of each.}}

The Constitution does not explicitly give [[judicial review]] to the Court, and Jefferson was very angry with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not.  Historians mostly agree that the framers of the Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court to have some sort of judicial review; what Marshall did was make operational their goals.<ref>Gordon S. Wood, "Judicial Review in the Era of the Founding" in ''Is the Supreme Court the guardian of the Constitution?'' ed by Robert A. Licht (1993) pp 153-66</ref> Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory<U+2014>government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution.  Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or act of a president unconstitutional.

===Burr conspiracy trial===
[[Burr_conspiracy#Trial|The Burr trial]] (1807) was presided over by Marshall together with Judge [[Cyrus Griffin]].  This was the great state trial of former Vice President [[Aaron Burr]], who was charged with [[treason]] and [[high misdemeanor]]. Prior to the trial, President Jefferson condemned Burr and strongly supported conviction. Marshall, however, narrowly construed the definition of treason provided in Article III of the Constitution; he noted that the prosecution had failed to prove that Burr had committed an "[[overt act]]," as the Constitution required. As a result, the jury acquitted the defendant, leading to increased animosity between the President and the Chief Justice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/burr/burraccount.html|title=Linder, Doug. "The Treason Trial of Aaron Burr."}}</ref>

===Fletcher v. Peck===
''[[Fletcher v. Peck]]'' (1810) was the first case in which the Supreme Court ruled a state law unconstitutional, though the Court had long before voided a state law as conflicting with the combination of the Constitution together with a treaty (Marshall had represented the losing side in that 1796 case).<ref name=Currie>Currie, David. ''The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The First Hundred Years, 1789-1888'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=AcT-ci3tfdUC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=Fletcher+%22state+law+unconstitutional%22++%22contract+clause%22&source=bl&ots=-ixnOQMw36&sig=IiRL4buMUiTOdsTSlobQfQ8oqAA&hl=en page 136] (Univ. of Chicago 1992).</ref>  In ''Fletcher'', the Georgia legislature had approved a land grant, known as the Yazoo Land Act of 1795. It was then revealed that the land grant had been approved in return for bribes, and therefore voters rejected most of the incumbents; the next legislature repealed the law and voided all subsequent transactions (even honest ones) that resulted from the [[Yazoo land scandal]].  The Marshall Court<U+00A0>held that the state legislature's repeal of the law was void because the sale was a binding contract, which according to Article I, Section 10, Clause I (the [[Contract Clause]]) of the Constitution, cannot be invalidated. <U+00A0>Marshall emphasized that the rescinding act would seize property from individuals who had honestly acquired it, and transfer that property to the public without any compensation. <U+00A0>He then expanded upon his own famous statement in ''Marbury'' about the province of the judiciary:

{{cquote|It is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments.}}

Based on this [[separation of powers]] principle,<ref>Burns, Arnold and Markman, Stephen.<U+00A0>"[http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&context=lawrev<U+00A0>Understanding Separation of Powers]", ''Pace Law Review'', 575,<U+00A0>589 (1987-01-01).</ref> Marshall questioned whether the rescinding act would be valid even if Georgia were a completely sovereign state independent of the federal Constitution. Ultimately, though, Marshall grounded the Court's opinion in the restrictions imposed by the federal Constitution. As in ''Marbury'', this decision of the Court in ''Fletcher'' was unanimous.

===McCulloch v. Maryland===
[[File:Mccullochvmaryland.png|thumb|250px|The text of the ''McCulloch v. Maryland'' decision, handed down March 6, 1819, as recorded in the minutes of the Supreme Court of the United States.]]

''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'' (1819) was one of several decisions during the 1810s and 1820s involving the balance of power between the federal government and the states where Marshall affirmed federal supremacy. He established in ''McCulloch'' that states could not tax federal institutions, and upheld congressional authority to create the [[Second Bank of the United States]], even though the authority to do this was not expressly stated in the Constitution. 

While Marshall's opinion in ''McCulloch'' was consistent with ''Marbury v. Madison'', it cut the other way by affirming the constitutionality of a federal statute while preventing states from passing laws that violate federal law. The opinion includes the famous statement, "We must never forget that it is a constitution we are expounding." Marshall laid down the basic theory of implied powers under a written Constitution; intended, as he said "to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs ...." Marshall envisaged a federal government which, although governed by timeless principles, possessed the powers "on which the welfare of a nation essentially depends." It would be free in its choice of means, and open to change and growth.<ref>Edward Samuel Corwin, ''John Marshall and the Constitution: a chronicle of the Supreme Court'' (1919) p. 133</ref>

The Court held that the bank was authorized by the clause of the Constitution that states that Congress can implement its powers by making laws that are "[[Necessary and Proper Clause|necessary and proper]]",  which Marshall said does not refer to one ''single'' way that Congress is allowed to act, but rather refers to ''various'' possible acts that implement all constitutionally established powers. Marshall famously provided the following time-honored interpretation of this clause in the Constitution:<ref name=Times />

{{cquote|Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.}}

According to ''The New York Times'', "Marshall did not intend his words as license for Congress to do whatever it wishes."<ref name=Times>{{cite book|title=The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge: A Desk Reference for the Curious Mind|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-BIGv9vIoqcC&pg=PA661&lpg=PA661|page=661|isbn=9780312376598|publisher=MacMillan|year=2007}}</ref> Instead, Marshall and the Court deemed the bank necessary and proper because it furthered various legitimate ends that are listed in the Constitution, such as regulating interstate commerce.

===Cohens v. Virginia===
''[[Cohens v. Virginia]]'' (1821) displayed  Marshall's nationalism as he enforced the supremacy of federal law over state law, under the [[Supremacy Clause]] of the Constitution.  In this case, he established that the Federal judiciary could hear appeals from decisions of state courts in criminal cases as well as the civil cases over which the court had asserted jurisdiction in ''[[Martin v. Hunter's Lessee]]'' (1816). Justices [[Bushrod Washington]] and [[Joseph Story]] proved to be his strongest allies in these cases.

Like ''Marbury'', this ''Cohens'' case was largely about the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.  The State of Virginia claimed that the Court had no jurisdiction to hear appeals from a state court in a case between a state and its own citizens, even if the case involved interpretation of a federal statute.  Marshall wrote that his court did have [[Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Original_and_appellate_jurisdiction|appellate jurisdiction]], but then went on to affirm the decision of the [[Virginia Supreme Court]] on the merits.  Marshall wrote:

{{cquote|We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given. The one or the other would be treason to the constitution.}}

In Marshall's day, the Court had not yet been given the discretion whether or not to take cases.<ref>Before the [[Evarts Act]] in 1891, the cases that could reach the Supreme Court were heard as a matter of right, meaning that the Court was required to issue a decision in each of those cases.  See Russel R. Wheeler & Cynthia Harrison, Fed. Judicial Ctr., Creating the Federal Judicial System 17<U+2013>18 (3d ed. 2005).</ref> Scholars such as Edward Hartnett contend that the Court's discretionary [[certiorari]] practice undercuts the rationale that Chief Justice Marshall gave in the ''Cohens'' case for reviewing the validity of state law, which was that the Court had no choice in the matter.<ref>Hartnett, Edward. <U+00A0>"[http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mclauchl/F03/POL461/COL%20L%20REV.pdf Questioning Certiorari: Some Reflections Seventy-Five Years After the Judges' Bill]", ''Columbia Law Review'', Volume 100 (November 2000).</ref>

The decision in ''Cohens'' demonstrated that the federal judiciary can act directly on private parties and state officials, and has the power to declare and impose on the states the Constitution and federal laws, but Marshall stressed that federal laws have limits.  For example, he said, "Congress has a right to punish murder in a fort, or other place within its exclusive jurisdiction; but no general right to punish murder committed within any of the States."

In this case, the Court affirmed that the Virginia Supreme Court correctly interpreted a federal statute that had established a [[lottery]] in [[Washington D.C.]] Like the Jefferson administration in ''Marbury'', the State of Virginia technically won this case even though the case set a precedent consolidating the power of the Court.

===Gibbons v. Ogden===
''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824) overturned a monopoly granted by the New York state legislature to certain steamships operating between New York and New Jersey.  [[Daniel Webster]] argued that the Constitution, by empowering Congress to regulate interstate commerce, implied that states do not have any [[concurrent power]] to regulate interstate commerce.<ref name=Hall>Hall, Kermit and John, Patrick. ''[http://www.sunnylandsclassroom.org/Downloads/ACBooks/Pursuit%20of%20Justice/Chapters/29-36_Ch.3.pdf The pursuit of justice: Supreme Court decisions that shaped America]'', pages 29-36 (Oxford University Press 2006).</ref> Chief Justice Marshall avoided [[dormant commerce clause|that issue about the exclusivity of the federal commerce power]] because that issue was not necessary to decide the case. Instead, Marshall relied on an actual, existing federal statute for licensing ships, and he held that that federal law was a legitimate exercise of the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce, so the federal law superseded the state law granting the monopoly.  

Webster was at that time a member of Congress, but nevertheless pressed his constitutional views on behalf of clients.<ref name=Hall /> After he won this case, he bragged that Marshall absorbed his arguments "as a baby takes in his mother's milk", even though Marshall had actually dismissed Webster's main argument.<ref name=Hall />

In the course of his opinion in this case, Marshall began the careful work of determining what the phrase "commerce...among the several states" means in the Constitution. He stressed that one must look at whether the commerce in question has wide-ranging effects, suggesting that commerce which does "affect other states" may be interstate commerce, even if it does not cross state lines.  Of course, the steamboats in this case did cross a state line, but Marshall suggested that his opinion had a broader scope than that. Indeed, Marshall's opinion in ''Gibbons'' would be cited by the Supreme Court much later when it upheld aspects of the [[New Deal]] in cases like ''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'' in 1942. But, the opinion in ''Gibbons'' can also be read more narrowly.<ref>Virelli, Louis and Leibowitz, David. "[http://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/conlaw/articles/volume3/issue3/Virelli3U.Pa.J.Const.L.926(2001).pdf 'Federalism Whether They Want It Or Not': The New Commerce Clause Doctrine And the Future of Federal Civil Rights Legislation After United States v. Morrison]", ''University of Pennsylvania Journal Constitutional Law'', Volume 3, page 926 (2001).</ref> After all, Marshall also wrote:

{{cquote|The enumeration presupposes something not enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language or the subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal commerce of a state.....Inspection laws, quarantine laws, health laws of every description, as well as laws for regulating the internal commerce of a State, and those which respect turnpike roads, ferries, &c., are....subject to State legislation. If the legislative power of the Union can reach them, it must be for national purposes; it must be where the power is expressly given for a special purpose, or is clearly incidental to some power which is expressly given.}}

The immediate impact of the historic decision in ''Gibbons'' was to end many state-granted monopolies.  That in turn lowered prices and promoted free enterprise.

===Other key cases===
Marshall wrote several other important [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] opinions, including the following.
;The Dartmouth College case
In ''[[Dartmouth College v. Woodward]]'', {{ussc|17|518|1819}}, the legal structure of modern corporations began to develop, when the Court held that private corporate charters are protected from state interference by the [[Contract Clause]] of the Constitution.

;Johnson v. M'Intosh
In ''[[Johnson v. M'Intosh]]'', {{ussc|21|543|1823}}, the Court held that private American citizens could not purchase tribal lands directly from Native Americans (then called "Indians").  Instead, only the government could do so, and then private citizens could purchase from the government.

;Worcester v. Georgia
In ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|31|515|1832}}, a Georgia criminal statute, which prohibited non-Indians from being present on Indian lands without a license from the state, was held unconstitutional, because the federal government has exclusive authority in such matters.  It is often said that, in response to the decision, President [[Andrew Jackson]], said something to the effect of: "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!" More reputable sources recognize this as a false quotation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boller |first=Paul F. |coauthor=John H. George |title=They Never Said It: A Book of False Quotes, Misquotes, & False Attributions |year=1989 |place=New York, NY |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://books.google.com/?id=NCOEYJ0q-DUC&printsec=frontcover |page=53 | isbn=9780195064698}}</ref>  In fact, the ruling in ''Worcester'' ordered nothing more than that Worcester be freed; Georgia complied after several months.
;Barron v. Baltimore
In ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'', {{ussc|32|243|1833}}, the Court held that the Bill of Rights was intended to apply only against the federal government, and therefore does not apply against the states.  The Court has subsequently held that the holding in ''Barron'' was altered by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

==Authorship of Washington biography==
Marshall greatly admired [[George Washington]], and between 1805 and 1807 published an influential five-volume biography.  Marshall's ''Life of Washington'' was based on records and papers provided to him by the late president's family. The first volume was reissued in 1824 separately as ''A History of the American Colonies''.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Dh4TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA9&dq=MARSHALL+History+of+the+American+Colonies&cd=5#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''A History of the American Colonies''].</ref>  The work reflected Marshall's Federalist principles.

==Other work, later life, legacy==
Marshall loved his home, built in 1790, in Richmond, Virginia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.apva.org/marshall/|title=John Marshall House, Richmond, Virginia.}}</ref> and spent as much time there as possible in quiet contentment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/49marshall/49marshall.htm | title = National Park Service, Marshall's Richmond home.}}</ref><ref name="nps.gov">[[National Park Service]], [http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/49marshall/49marshall.htm ''"The Great Chief Justice" at Home,'' Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan]</ref>  While in Richmond he attended St. John's Church in [[Church Hill]] until 1814 when he led the movement to hire [[Robert Mills (architect)|Robert Mills]] as architect of [[Monumental Church]], which commemorated the death of 72 people in a theatre fire. The Marshall family occupied pew No. 23 at Monumental Church and entertained the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] there during his [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|visit to Richmond in 1824]]. Marshall was not religious and never joined any church; he did not believe Christ was divine.<ref>{{Cite document | last = Smith | title = John Marshall | pages = 36, 406 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref>  For approximately three months each year, he would be away in Washington for the Court's annual term; he would also be away for several weeks to serve on the circuit court in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].

In 1823, he became first president of the Richmond branch of the [[American Colonization Society]], which was dedicated to resettling freed [[Slavery in the United States|American slaves]] in [[Liberia]], on the West coast of Africa.  In 1828, he presided over a convention to promote internal improvements in Virginia.

In 1829, he was a delegate to the state constitutional convention, where he was again joined by fellow American statesman and loyal Virginians, [[James Madison]] and [[James Monroe]], although all were quite old by that time. Marshall mainly spoke at this convention to promote the necessity of an independent judiciary.

On December 25, 1831, Mary, his beloved wife of some 49 years, died. Most who knew Marshall agreed that after Mary's death, he was never quite the same. His health, which had not been good for several years, rapidly declined in 1835, and in June he journeyed to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] for medical attendance. There he died on July 6, at the age of 79, having served as Chief Justice for over 34 years.<ref>{{Cite document | last = Smith | page = 523 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

An engraved portrait of Marshall appears on U.S. paper money on the series 1890 and 1891 treasury notes. These rare notes are in great demand by note collectors today. Also, in 1914, an engraved portrait of Marshall was used as the central vignette on series 1914 $500 federal reserve notes. These notes are also quite scarce. ([[William McKinley]] replaced Marshall on the $500 bill in 1928.)

On September 24, 1955, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued the 40<U+00A2> [[Liberty Issue]] postage stamp honoring [http://www.usapostagestamps.com/1954/40c_John_Marshall.htm Marshall with a 40 cent stamp].

Having grown from a Reformed Church academy, Marshall College, named upon the death of Chief Justice John Marshall, officially opened in 1836 with a well-established reputation. After a merger with Franklin College in 1853, the school was renamed [[Franklin and Marshall College]]. The college went on to become one of the nation's foremost liberal arts colleges.

Additionally, four law schools and one University today bear his name: The [[Marshall-Wythe School of Law]] (now [[William and Mary Law School]] at the [[College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]; The [[Cleveland-Marshall College of Law]] in Cleveland, Ohio; [[John Marshall Law School (Atlanta)|John Marshall Law School]] in Atlanta, Georgia; and, [[John Marshall Law School (Chicago)|The John Marshall Law School]] in Chicago, Illinois. The University that bears his name is [[Marshall University]] in Huntington West Virginia. [[Marshall County, Illinois]], [[Marshall County, Indiana]], [[Marshall County, Kentucky]] and [[Marshall County, West Virginia]] are also named in his honor. A number of high schools around the nation have also been named for him.

John Marshall's birthplace in [[Fauquier County]] is a park, the John Marshall Birthplace Park, and a marker can be seen on [[Virginia Route 28|Route 28]] noting this place and event.

[[Marshall, Michigan]] was named in his honor five years before Marshall's death. It was the first of dozens of communities and counties named for him. [[ Marshall County, Kentucky]] was named in his honor.
