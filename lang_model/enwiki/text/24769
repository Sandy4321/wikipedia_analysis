[[Image:Florida hurricane (pre-1900) tracks.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Tracks of hurricanes over [[Florida]] from 1851 to 1899]]
The '''List of Florida hurricanes''' prior to 1900 extends back to 1523 and encompasses 159 [[Atlantic hurricane]]s known to have affected [[Florida]]. Since the start of the [[tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]] [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis|database]] in 1851, there were only eight years in which no tropical cyclone affected the state. Collectively, tropical cyclones in Florida resulted in at least 6,504 fatalities and monetary damage of at least $91.7 million (2006 USD). At least 109 boats or ships were either driven ashore, wrecked, or damaged due to the storms.

Information is sparse for earlier years due to limitations in [[tropical cyclone observation]], though as coastlines became more populated, more data became available. The [[National Hurricane Center]] recognizes the uncertainty in both the death tolls and the dates of the events.<ref name="note">{{cite web|author=Edward N.
