'''''Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Benjamin Radford]], an American writer and investigator. The book documents Radford's five-year investigation into accounts of the [[chupacabra]], a well known [[cryptid]]. The chupacabra is said to be a vampiric predatory animal that drains the blood of animal victims while avoiding human detection.

Radford's work received generally favorable reviews within academic folklore, cryptozoological and skeptical publications, as Radford's investigation has been credited with solving the chupacabra mystery.

==Overview==
The author, Benjamin Radford, attempts to solve the mystery of the [[chupacabra]], including whether it is a legend or real animal, what its physical and behavior characteristics are, its origin and connection to folklore, and what exactly is happening to the animals reported to be its victims.

''Tracking the Chupacabra'' documents Radford's five-year<ref name="radford-2011">

==Reception==
Matt Crowley, reviewing the book for ''[[The Skeptical Inquirer]]'' in July 2011, recapped Radford's process of tracing the origins of reported chupacabra sightings, tracking the changing physical attributes of the creature based on its description as reports journeyed from Puerto Rico eventually traveling to the United States.<ref name="crowley-2011">

Reviewing ''Tracking the Chupacabra'' for ''[[Library Journal]]'', Janet Tapper described Radford as "thorough in his investigation; interviewing witnesses, providing creepy photographs of otherworldly creatures, serving up DNA analysis, and contemplating theories of mass psychosis."

Reviewing the book for the ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'', [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]'s Virginia Fugarino stated that "to date, few books have been dedicated to taking a serious look at this creature," and commented on Radford's treatment of folklore, saying "he particularly explores how the chupacabra and other Latin American vampiric creatures can be seen to represent metaphorically postcolonial concerns and resentment of intrusion from outside political forces, specifically the U.S. government."<ref name="fugarino-2011">

Cryptozoologist [[Karl Shuker]] performed a review of Radford's work in a March 2012 issue of ''[[Fortean Times]]'', stating that "the chupacabra has met its match," recommending the book's "scientific detachment and common sense" for readers looking for those traits.<ref name="shuker-2012">

In a review for ''Aztl<U+00E1>n'', an interdisciplinary journal of [[Chicano|Chicano studies]] published by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[San Diego State University]]'s William A. Nericcio wrote that "the power of Radford's work is the depth of his research." Nericcio went on to discuss the impact of Radford's investigation on the dialogue regarding the cultural impact of the chupacabra in the Latin American community. According to Nericcio, "the rise of evangelical churches in Latin America and the American Southwest [...] coincides with sightings of the chupacabra and the virus-like spread of its mythology," referring to the perceived connection by some proponents between the chupacabra and satanic or occult phenomena.<ref name="nericcio-2012">

A reviewer for ''The Latin Americanist'', the [[University of Oklahoma]]'s J. Justin Castro noted that chupacabra reports have "captured the imagination of people around the world," and praised Radford's "insightful and entertaining book," stating that "Radford sets the record straight, debunking many of the myths about the goatsucker." While Castro criticized some of Radford's arguments concerning feelings of U.S. exploitation of Puerto Rico as "largely unfounded," Castro stated that "His concluding arguments, on the other hand, are more viable. He makes a strong case that cinema greatly influenced the chupacabra phenomenon."<ref name="castro-2012">

Tim Hull, in ''[[Tucson Weekly]]'', stated that "Radford's most interesting revelations are about the psychological and sociopolitical structures behind the folklore, especially as they relate to the monster's origins in Puerto Rico, where some people believe that the chupacabra is a secret U.S. government experiment gone wrong." Hull also went on to say that "While Radford's book<U+2014>which is well-written and a fun read<U+2014>should be the last word on the chupacabra's real-world existence, it won't be. As the author points out, the beast has entered the realm of conspiracy, where no amount of evidence, or logic, can sway the true believer."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hull|first=Tim|title=Debunking Chupacabra: The managing editor of 'Skeptical Inquirer' says no to a mythical beast|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/debunking-chupacabra/Content?oid=2950786|work=Tucson Weekly|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>

===Short history of the Chupacabra===
Opening with "The Goatsucker Mystery," Radford introduced the essential portions of the [[chupacabra]] legend and its different versions, comparing the creatures' characteristics with another cryptid, [[Bigfoot]], which he writes is known for leaving large footprints. Similarly, according to Radford, the chupacabra or "goat sucker" is "known less for what it is than for what it leaves behind," which are dead animals that have reportedly been drained of blood.<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|3}} Early eyewitness accounts were briefly described, as well as the migration of the chupacabra concept from Puerto Rico to Mexico, Chile, Brazil, and the United States.

In his overview Radford summarized theories concerning the origin of the chupacabra, some paranormal or religious in nature, and interviewed several cryptozoologists, such as [[Karl Shuker]] and [[Jonathan Downes]], who attribute a large number of reports as likely being caused by "several unrelated animals," and some as possibly the result of mongoose attacks, respectively.<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|17<U+2013>18}} While animal predation is not a new phenomenon, Radford stated that the element unique to most chupacabra reports are claims of the animals' blood being drained.

===Folklore of the Chupacabra===
In "A Brief history of Vampires," Radford wrote about common themes of vampire folklore. While exploring 18th-century accounts of European vampires, Radford notes that reports of vampire predation are used to explain otherwise unexplained misfortunes, such as disease, malnutrition, or loss of livestock. Noting that while most readers are likely to be more familiar with vampires of Slavic origin, Radford continues to explore vampire folklore from Africa, Latin America, the Andes mountains, as well as several other specific vampiric legends, such as the Vampire of Moca and the "Monster-Thing" of Nebraska.

"Chupacabras in Popular Culture" described how, in Radford's view, the legend grew in Puerto Rico from observations by locals of apparent animal predations into rumors of a mysterious creature that was responsible. According to Radford, the news media leapt to conclusions, which, in his opinion, further drove alleged sightings and reports, to the extent that "any odd event"<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|41}} was attributed to the chupacabra.

===Search for the Chupacabra===
The chapter "Searching for Chupacabras in Nicaragua" deals with Radford's investigation in [[Nicaragua]] near the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|R<U+00ED>o San Juan]], where one of the best known alleged chupacabra remains had been discovered. While performing a physical search for the animal, Radford interviewed local experts, such as guide Fernando Casanova of Nicaragua's Indio Maiz Biological Reserve, about the local understanding of the chupacabra's "character or description," as well as examining tracks found in the area and comparing them to casts reportedly taken from scenes surrounding chupacabra victims.<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|66<U+2013>72}}

In "The Dead Vampires Speak: Chupacabra Carcasses," Radford discussed the analyses of various recovered corpses put forward as candidates for identification of the chupacabra animal. He included a carcass discovered by Jorge Talavera in 2000 in Nicaragua, which was identified as a common dog by researchers at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN), though the UNAN analysis was disputed by Talavera as a cover-up.<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|78}}<ref name="national-geo-2008">

===Solving the Mystery of the Chupacabra===
Having analyzed the various forms of chupacabra remains and reports, in "Reconsidering the Goatsucker," Radford attempted to determine the origins of the chupacabra creature. Radford's search for the first eyewitness report of the chupacabra leads him to interview Madelyne Tolentino of Canovanas, Puerto Rico. She had the first descriptive account of the creature shortly after an epidemic of animal predation reports. Tolentino's account bore a resemblance to the character Sil in the 1995 movie ''[[Species (film)|Species]]'', a resemblance confirmed by Tolentino, who was interviewed by Radford. In the interview, Tolentino stated that she had seen the film ''Species'' prior to her sighting of the creature, and that she believed that an experiment had been conducted in Puerto Rico and had escaped, similar to the events depicted in the movie. According to Radford, Tolentino "believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''Species'' were actually happening in reality at the time in Puerto Rico," causing Radford to conclude that the movie ''Species'' may have provided the influence for the first reported chupacabra sighting in 1995.<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|136}} According to Radford, "You can make a direct connection between the film hitting theaters, her seeing the creature in the film, seeing it in the street, making the report and entering the public consciousness."<ref>{{Cite web| title = El Chupacabra Mystery Solved: It's Always Been in Your Imagination| work = Hispanically Speaking News| accessdate = 2013-06-22| date = 2011-03-24| url = http://www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/latino-daily-news/details/el-chupacabra-mystery-solved-its-always-been-in-your-imagination/6347/}}</ref>

Radford concluded his investigation with the chapter "The Zoology of Chupacabras and the Science of Vampires." Compiling reports of researchers who examined victims of animal predation in apparent chupacabra attacks, Radford noted that the reports' claims that the animals had been [[Exsanguination|exsanguinated]] were inaccurate. The apparent loss of blood could be explained by internal hemorrhaging and pooling of blood at the bottom of the corpse. The attribution of the attacks on livestock to a vampiric entity can be explained by the puncture wounds resulting from the canine teeth left by most predators, who often instinctively go for the neck, according to taxidermist Jerry Ayer.<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|165}} Radford attributes much of the spread of chupacabra sightings to factors including the mass media (especially the Internet and television shows), eyewitness misperceptions, ignorance of forensic science, social contagion, and mass hysteria,<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|166}} and concludes that "every supposedly mysterious detail of the bloodsucking 'monster-thing' and its victims was explained."<ref name="radford-2011" />{{rp|169}}
