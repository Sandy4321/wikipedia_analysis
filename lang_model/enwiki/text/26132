Capacities of the half pipes that you can get at the bottom part of the stair tower, can accommodate up to two passengers. Riders exit at a platform in the middle (bottom).
*The [[Waterworks]]: A pair of [[water slide]]s, one open and one enclosed.
*Ular-Lah: The first [[Water_slide#Tube.2Fraft_slides|raft slide]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. Each raft can accommodate up to 6 riders. The rafts shoot down a 80.5m long free-fall chute and then manoeuvres its way down into a shallow plunge pool.

===Family attractions===

*Shiok River: 345m in length, skirting the perimeter of the park. Riders can swim in it or get a float and move along the currents. This ride also has miniature caves. Note that there are two "stations" on the river: one for entry and one for exiting riders. There is also a rest stop along a section of the river's course.

*[[Tsunami]]: [[Wave pool]]. Tidal waves appear every 15 minutes.the tsunami waves will appear after a bell has sounded. Riders can take a float and move to the 1.8m deep area and wait for the tidal wave to begin.The waves usually lasts for about 10 minutes.
*Professor's Playground: A water [[playground]] designed around the theme of an experimental laboratory. Features ladders, slides and fountains and hidden water cannons. Every 10 minutes, a huge bucket tips water onto the people who pass by or who are waiting below it. Before the bucket tips, a bell will sound to invite people to gather below it to standby for the water to come down. There is usually a large crowd under the bucket before this happens.
