:''For the character in the 10th century [[Culture of Iran|Persian]] epic [[Shahnameh]] or ''Epic of Kings'', see [[Rostam]].''
'''Rostam Farrokhz<U+0101>d''' ([[Persian Language|Persian]]: <U+0631><U+0633><U+062A><U+0645> <U+0641><U+0631><U+0651><U+062E><U+0632><U+0627><U+062F>) was an [[Sasanian]] nobleman from the [[House of Ispahbudhan|Ispahbudhan family]], who was the ''[[spahbed]]'' of [[Atropatene (satrapy)|Atropatene]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] during the reign of [[Borandukht]] and [[Yazdegerd III]]. Rostam is remembered as an historical figure, a character in the Persian epic poem [[Shahnameh]], and as a touchstone of most [[Iranian nationalism|Iranian nationalists]].

== Origins ==
Rostam Farrokhz<U+0101>d was a powerful Sasanian general and a member of the [[House of Ispahbudhan]], one of the [[seven Parthian clans]]. His grandfather was [[Vinduyih]], the uncle of [[Khosrau II]], and brother of [[Vistahm]], an [[Sasanian]] rival king. His father, [[Farrukh Hormizd]], was the ''[[spahbed]]'' of [[Atropatene (satrapy)|Atropatene]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], while his brother [[Khurrazad]], served as minister of the empire.

== Biography ==
During the late phase of the [[Byzantine<U+2013>Sasanian War of 602<U+2013>628]], Rostam and his father Farrukh rebelled against [[Khosrau II]] in [[Atropatene (satrapy)|Azarbaijan]], allowing the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Heraclius]] to invade [[Atropatene (satrapy)|Atropatene]], where he sacked several cities, including the [[Takht-e Soleym<U+0101>n|Adur Gushnasp]] temple.<ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 152-153</ref>

In 628, the feudal families of Persia secretly mutinied against Khosrau and joined [[Shahrbaraz]]. Khosrau's son, [[Kavadh II]] was then released by the feudal families of the [[Sasanian Empire]], which included: The [[House of Ispahbudhan]] represented by Farrukh Hormizd, and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad, and [[Khurrazad]]. [[Shahrbaraz]], who represented the [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]]. The Armenian faction represented by [[Varaztirots II Bagratuni]] and finally the [[Kanarang]].<ref>Pourshariati (2008), p. 173</ref> On February, Kavadh, along with [[Aspad Gushnasp]], captured [[Ctesiphon]] and imprisoned [[Khosrau II]]. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the [[Sasanian Empire]] on 25 February, and with the aid of his minister [[Piruz Khosrow]], executed of all his brother and half-brothers, which included [[Mardanshah (Sasanian prince)|Mardanshah]], the favorite son of [[Khosrau II]]. Three days later, he ordered [[Mihr Hormozd]] to execute his father. With the agreement of the Persian nobles, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]], which made the Byzantines regain all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a [[war indemnity]], along with the [[True Cross]] and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.<ref name = "Oman212">{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA212 212]}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&pg=PA178 178], [http://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&pg=PA189 189<U+2013>190]}}</ref>

Following the loss of territory required for the peace treaty, Farrukh, along with Rostam and [[Khurrazad]], formed an independent state within the northern part of the [[Sasanian Empire]], which was known as the Pahlav (Parthian) faction. [[Piruz Khosrow]] also formed an independent state in southern Persia, which was known as the Parsig (Persian) faction. This divided the resources of the country which resulted in a devastating plague in the western provinces of [[Persia]], killing half of the population along with [[Kavadh II]] who was succeeded by [[Ardashir III]].<ref>''SASANIAN DYNASTY'', A. Shapur Shahbazi, '''Encyclopaedia Iranica''', (20 July 2005).[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/sasanian-dynasty]</ref>

During the reign of [[Azarmidokht]], [[Farrukh Hormizd]], in order to make a union with the Parsig faction, and legitimize his power, asked Azarmidokht to marry him. Not daring to refuse, Azarmidokht had him killed with the aid of the [[House of Mihran|Mihranid]] [[Siyavakhsh]], who was grandson of [[Bahram Chobin]], the famous ''[[spahbed]]'' and briefly ''[[shah]]anshah''. After the death of Farrukh, Rostam became the new ''[[spahbed]]'' of [[Atropatene (satrapy)|Atropatene]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], he then avenged his father by occupying [[Ctesiphon]] and killing Azarmidokht. Rostam then restored [[Borandukht]] to the throne, who later made a meeting with the Pahlav and Parsig faction, where both factions agreed to work together. Piruz, however, later strangled Borandukht himself.<ref>Pourshariati (2008), p. 218</ref> Which ended the Parsig-Pahlav collaboration and resumed their hostilities. Rostam and Piruz, were, however, threatened by their own men, and agreed to work together once again, and crowned [[Yazdegerd III]], the grandson of [[Khosrau II]], as the new king of the empire.

== Arab conquest ==
Throughout this period the great expansion of [[History of Islam|Arab-Muslim]] armies had slowly been [[Islamic conquest of Iran|penetrating the south-western frontiers]] under [[Umar ibn al-Khattab|Caliph Umar ibn al-Khatt<U+0101>b]]. The Persians had repeatedly blocked this advance and in 634 the Caliph's army suffered a seemingly decisive defeat at the [[Battle of the Bridge]]. The [[Sasanian]] general [[Bahman Jaduya]], though, was ordered back to [[Ctesiphon]] by Rostam in order to put down a revolt in his own capital city. Caliph `Umar's forces retreated, only to launch a successful assault three years later.

In 636, [[Yazdegerd III]] ordered Rostam Farrokhzad to subdue the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim Arabs invading Iran]] and then told him: "Today you are the
[most prominent] man among the Iranians. You see that the people of Iran have not faced a situation like this since the family of [[Ardashir I]] assumed power."<ref>http://www.kavehfarrokh.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/Decline_and_Fall_of_the_Sasanian_Empire.pdf</ref>

[[Yazdegerd III]] then said: "the Arabs and their exploits since they have camped at Qadisiyyah and ... what the Iranians have suffered at their hands."

Rostam replied that he believed the Arabs to be "a pack of wolves, falling upon unsuspecting shepherds and annihilating them."

However, [[Yazdegerd III]] then argued with him and said: "It is not like that. I put the question to you in the expectation that you would describe them clearly and that then I would be able to reinforce you so that you might act according to the [real situation]. But you did not say the right thing." [[Yazdegerd III]] then compared the Arabs to an eagle who "looked upon a mountain where birds take shelter at night and stay in their nests at the foot of it." In the morning the birds recognized that the eagle is preying upon them. Whenever "a bird became separated from the rest, the eagle snatched him. When the birds saw him [doing this], they did not take off out of fear ... If they had taken off all at once, they would have repelled him. The worst thing that could happen to them would be that all would escape save one. But if each group acted in turn and took off
separately, they all perished. This was the similarity between them and the Iranians.<ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 225, 224</ref> [[Yazdegerd III]] was clearly describing the division and lack of collaboration among the different Iranian factions.<ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 225, 224</ref>

Rostam, however, did not agree with [[Yazdegerd III]] and then told him: "O king, let me [act in my own way]. The Arabs still dread the Iranians as long as you do not arouse them against me. It is to be hoped that my good fortune will last and that God will save us the trouble." Rostam then said: "We should employ the right ruse," he insisted. "In war, patience is superior to haste, and the order of the day is now patience. To fight one army after another is better than a single [and total] defeat and is also harder on our enemy." [[Yazdegerd III]], however, was too young and stubborn to listen to Rostam.<ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 225</ref>

Before the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Arabs]] and the [[Sasanians]] engaged in battle, Rostam tried to negotiate with the Arabs. He therefor sent them a letter saying:

{{Cquote|''In the presence of the pure Lord of the world we may not stand without fear and reverence, for it is through him that the revolving heavens endure and all his governance is justice and charity. May there be blessings from him on the monarch who is the adornment of his crown, throne and seal, who by his Farr holds Ahriman [the spirit of evil] enthralled, the lord of the sword and the sublime crown. This deplorable vent has occurred and to no purpose has this grievous thing, this struggle, come to pass. Tell me this, who is your king? What man are you and what is your religion and way of life? Over whom do you seek to triumph, you, naked commander of a naked army? With a loaf of bread you are satisfied yet remain hungry. You have neither elephants nor platforms nor baggage nor gear. Mere existence in Iran would be enough for you, since crown and ring belong to another, one who possesses elephants and treasures, Farr and sublime rank. His forebears from ancestor to ancestor have all been renowned kings. When he is visible, there is no moon in the sky. There is no monarch of his stature on earth. When he laughs at a feast with his lips open and teeth shining like silver, he gives away what is the ransom of an Arab chief without any loss to his treasury. His hounds, panthers and falcons number twelve thousand, all dight with golden bells and earrings. From a diet of camel's milk and lizards the Arabs have come so far as to aspire to the Kayanian throne. Is there no shame in your eyes? Do feeling and honour not lie on the path of your wisdom? With a countenance such as yours, such birth, such sentiments and spirit, do you aspire to such a crown and such a throne? If you seek to possess some portion of the world you will not make over-boastful claims. Send us some man to speak for you, someone of experience, a warrior of understand, of the kind who may tell us what your religion is and who your guide is upon the royal throne. I shall send a cavalier to the Shah requesting him to grant you what you desire. And now do not attempt to make war on so great a monarch, for it is in his hands that the outcome of it will lie. Observe well the contents of his letter filled with good counsel; do not bind up the eyes and ears of wisdom.''<ref>http://books.google.dk/books?id=BlJqoAdGvEYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rostam+Farrokhz%C4%81d&hl=da&sa=X&ei=Cq0wUrr1F4LStQalz4CADQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>}}

The Arabs did as he asked and sent a man named Zuhrah, the negotiations with him did not go well, Rostam therefor asked for another messenger, and a man named Mughirah b. Shubah was sent. Rostam then told Mughirah: "We are firmly established in the land, victorious over our enemies, and noble among nations. None of the kings has our power, honor, dominion." Mughirah then interrupted him and said: "If you need our protection, then be our slave, and pay the poll tax out of hand while being humiliated; otherwise it is the sword." Feeling insulted, Rostam flew into a rage, and swore by the sun: "Dawn will not break upon you tomorrow before I kill you all".<ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 228, 227</ref>

Rostam, while preparing to face the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arab]] army, wrote a letter to his brother [[Khurrazad]], telling him to gather the army of Iran and then go to [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] and pray for what was about to transpire, and he reminded them all that [[Yazdegerd III]] was the only legacy left from the [[Sassanid|Sasanians]].<ref>Pourshariati (2008), pp. 229</ref> Rostam then set out from [[Ctesiphon]] in command of a large Sasanian force to confront the [[History of Islam|Arab-Muslim]] army of [[Umar ibn al-Khattab|Caliph `Umar ibn al-Khatt<U+0101>b]] on the western bank of the [[Euphrates River]] at the plains of [[Battle of al-Qadisiyyah|al-Q<U+0101>disiyyah]], a now abandoned city in southern [[Mesopotamia]], southwest of [[Hilla|al-Hillah]] and [[Kufa|al-K<U+016B>fah]] in [[Iraq]].

During the final day of the battle, there was a heavy sandstorm facing the Sasanian army. Rostam used a camel loaded with weapons as shelter to avoid the sandstorm.<!--ref name="Al-Tabari 1993" /--> Not knowing that Rostam was behind, [[Hil<U+0101>l ibn `Ullafah]] accidentally cut the girdle of the load on the camel.<!--ref name="Al-Tabari 1993" /--> The weapons fell on Rostam and broke his back leaving him half dead and paralyzed. Hilal beheaded Rostam and shouted "I swear to the god of Kaaba that I have killed Rostam." Shocked by the head of their legendary leader dangling before their eyes, the Sasanian were demoralized, and the commanders lost control of the army. Many Sasanian soldiers were slain in the chaos, many escaped through the river, and finally the rest of the army surrendered.<!--ref name="Al-Tabari 1993" /-->

=== Consequences ===
The defeat of Rostam's army heavily ruined the morale of the people of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Soon, after Rostam's death, his brother, [[Khurrazad]] was killed at the [[battle of Jalula]]. Many more Sasanian veterans were killed, which included: [[Piruz Khosrow]], [[Shahrvaraz Jadhuyih]], [[Mardanshah]] in 642, and [[Siyavakhsh]] and [[Muta of Dailam]] in 643. In 651, [[Yazdegerd III]] was murdered by [[Mahuy Suri]], and the Arabs shortly conquered [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].

==Personality and skills==
The [[Shahnameh]] describes him as: "A sagacious, warlike and one who had been a conqueror. He was a calculator of the stars, of great perception; and he listened deeply to what his counsellors advised."<ref>http://books.google.dk/books?id=BlJqoAdGvEYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rostam+Farrokhz%C4%81d&hl=da&sa=X&ei=Cq0wUrr1F4LStQalz4CADQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref>

Christensen describes him as: "A man endowed with extraordinary energy, a good administrator and a fine general."<ref>Op. Cit. p. 496.</ref>
