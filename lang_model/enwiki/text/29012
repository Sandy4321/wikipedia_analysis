'''Thierry Daniel Henry''' ({{IPA2|tj<U+025B>'<U+0280>i <U+0251><U+0303>'<U+0280>i}}, born [[17 August]] [[1977]]) is a French [[football (soccer)|football]] player. Renowned for his pace and [[Football_pitch#Goals|goal]] scoring record, he plays as a [[striker]] for the [[France national football team|France national team]] and [[FC Barcelona]].

Henry was born and brought up in a suburb of [[Paris]] where he played for an array of local sides as a youngster and showed great promise as a goal-scorer. He was spotted by [[AS Monaco]] in 1990 and signed instantly, making his professional debut in 1994. Good form led to an international call-up in 1998, after which, he signed for the Italian defending champions [[Juventus FC|Juventus]]. He had a disappointing season playing on the [[midfielder#winger|wing]], before joining [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] for [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]10.5 million in 1999.

It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer. Despite initially struggling in the [[FA Premier League|Premiership]], he emerged as Arsenal's top goal-scorer for almost every season. Under long-time mentor and coach [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]], he became a prolific striker and Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 226 goals in all competitions. Henry won two league titles and three [[FA Cup]]s with ''The Gunners'', and was twice nominated for the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]], named the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] twice and [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]] thrice. Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as [[Captain (sports)|club captain]], leading them to the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League final in 2006]]. In June 2007, after eight years with Arsenal, he transferred to FC Barcelona for a fee of <U+00A3>16.1 million.

Henry has enjoyed similar success with the French national squad, having won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[Euro 2000]]. In October 2007, he surpassed [[Michel Platini]]'s record becoming the country's top goal-scorer of all time. Off the pitch, as a result of his own experience, Henry is an active spokesperson against [[racism in football]]. His footballing style and personality have ensured that he is one of the most commercially marketable footballers in the world; he has featured in advertisements for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Reebok]], [[Renault]] and [[Gillette]].

==Early years==
Henry is of [[Lesser Antilles|Antillean]] heritage;<ref name=jock>[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Henry/Henry_bio.html Thierry Henry Bio], jockbio.com, accessed [[20 October]] [[2007]].</ref> his father, Antoine, is from [[Guadeloupe]] ([[La D<U+00E9>sirade]] island), and his mother, Maryse, is from [[Martinique]]. He was born and grew up in a tough environment in the heavily urbanised [[Les Ulis]] district of [[Paris]] which, despite its hardships, provided good footballing facilities.<ref name=tea>Anthony, Andrew, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,6903,1315428,00.html "Thierry Henry, you're having a laugh"], observer.guardian.co.uk, [[3 October]] [[2004]], accessed [[25 July]] [[2007]].</ref> As a six-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football.<ref name=goal>[http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=336314 Goal.com Profile: Thierry Henry], goal.com, accessed [[23 September]] [[2007]].</ref> Five years later, Henry played his first game for the club. He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to Viry-Ch<U+00E2>tillon for two years.<ref name=jock/> US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza<U+2014>Henry's future mentor<U+2014>followed him there.<ref name=tea/>

==Club career==

===AS Monaco (1992<U+2013>1998) and Juventus (1999)===
In 1990, [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6<U+2013>0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even attending a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite [[Clairefontaine]] academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]]'s AS Monaco as a youth player.<ref name=goal/> Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with AS Monaco and was given his professional debut in 1994. Wenger put Henry on the left [[Midfielder#Winger|wing]] because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against [[defender (football)#fullback|full-backs]] than [[defender (football)#centre back|centre-backs]]. In his first season with Monaco, Henry scored three goals in 18 appearances.<ref name=jock/> 

Wenger continued to search for the perfect playing position for Henry, and suspected that he should be deployed as a striker instead, but he was unsure.<ref name=jock/> Under the tutelage of his manager, Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996, and in the [[Division 1 season 1996/1997|1996<U+2013>97 season]], his solid performances helped the club win the [[Ligue 1]] title.<ref name=goal/><ref name=data>[http://www.footballdatabase.com/index.php?page=player&Id=193&pn=Thierry_Daniel_Henry HENRY], footballdatabase.com, accessed [[20 October]] [[2007]].</ref> During the [[Division 1 season 1997/1998|1997<U+2013>98 season]], he was instrumental in leading his club to the [[UEFA Champions League 1997-98|UEFA Champions League semi-final]], setting a French record by scoring seven goals in the competition.<ref name=jock/><ref name=monacosemifinal>[http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=250617 Soccerbase stats for AS Monaco Semi Final game], soccerbase.com, accessed [[30 September]] [[2007]].</ref> By his third season, he had received his first [[cap (sport)|cap]] for [[France national football team|the national team]], and was part of the winning team in the [[1998 World Cup]].<ref name=jock/> He continued to impress at his tenure with Monaco, and in his five seasons with the French club, the young winger scored 20 league goals in 105 appearances.<ref name=data/>

Henry left Monaco in January 1999, one year before his friend and teammate [[David Trezeguet]], and moved to [[Italy|Italian]] [[Serie A]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for <U+00A3>10.5 million.<ref name=goal/> Henry played on the wing,<ref name=henryadapt>Clarke, Richard, [http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=News&article=428852&lid=NewsHeadline&Title=Henry+-+Why+I+know+I+must+adapt+to+our+new+formation "Henry - Why I must adapt to our new formation"], arsenal.com, [[14 November]], [[2006]], accessed [[26 March]], [[2007]].</ref> but he was ineffective against the Serie A defensive discipline in a position uncharacteristic for himself, and scored just three goals in 16 appearances.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/worldcup2006/stars/bios/henry-thierry.html Thierry Henry - France], cbc.ca/sports, accessed [[30 September]] [[2007]].</ref>

===Arsenal (1999<U+2013>2007) ===
Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus in August 1999 to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] for <U+00A3>10.5 million, reuniting with his former manager [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]].<ref name=socpro>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/profile?id=8039&cc=4716 Thierry Henry], soccernet.espn.go.com, accessed [[30 September]] [[2007]].</ref> It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer,<ref name=fp>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3717770.stm Ronaldinho wins Fifa player award], news.bbc.co.uk, [[20 December]] [[2004]], accessed [[23 September]] [[2007]].</ref> and although his transfer was not without controversy, Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee.<ref name=jock/> Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward [[Nicolas Anelka]], Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger, a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come. However, doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games.<ref name=tea/> After several difficult months in England, Henry even conceded that he had to "be re-taught everything about the art of striking."<ref name=tea/> These doubts were dispelled when he ended [[1999-00 in English football|his first season]] at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26.<ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=13501 Games played by Thierry Henry in 1999<U+2013>2000], soccerbase.com, accessed [[25 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Arsenal finished second in the league behind [[Manchester United]], and lost in the [[2000 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final]] against [[Turkish]] side [[Galatasaray S.K.]]<ref name=jock/>

[[Image:Thierry Henry Charlton.jpg|thumb|left|Henry in a game against [[Charlton Athletic]] in 2006]]

Coming off the back of a victorious [[Euro 2000]] campaign with the national side, Henry was ready to make an impact in the [[2000-01 in English football|2000<U+2013>01 campaign]]. Despite recording fewer goals and [[assist (football)|assists]] than his first season, Henry's second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough, as he became the club's top goal-scorer.<ref name=socpro/> Armed with one of the league's best offences, Arsenal closed in quickly on perennial rivals Manchester United for the league title. Henry remained frustrated however by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours, and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse.<ref name=jock/> 

Success finally arrived during the [[2001-02 in English football|2001&ndash;02 season]]. Arsenal finished seven points above [[Liverpool FC|Liverpool]] to pip them to the league title, and defeated [[Chelsea FC|Chelsea]] 2<U+2013>0 in the [[FA Cup Final 2002|FA Cup Final]].<ref name=jock/> Henry became the league's top goal-scorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a [[the double|double]] and his first silverware with the club.<ref name=goal/><ref name=socpro/> There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the [[2002 World Cup]], but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage.<ref name=jock/>

[[2002-03 in English football|2002&ndash;03]] proved to be another productive season for Henry, as he scored 42 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists<U+2014>remarkable returns for a striker.<ref name=socpro/> In doing so, he led Arsenal to another [[FA Cup]] triumph.<ref>Freedman, Dan, [http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/04/45873.htm "Gunners take home Cup"], thefa.com, [[17 May]] [[2003]], accessed [[24 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Throughout the season, he competed with Manchester United's [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] for the league scoring title, but the latter edged Henry to the title by a goal.<ref name=jock/> Nonetheless, Henry was named both the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] and [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]].<ref name=giveme>[http://www.givemefootball.com/rolls_of_honour/playersplayerroll.html PFA Players' Player of the Year Roll of Honour], givemefootball.com, accessed [[25 July]] [[2007]].</ref><ref name=kk/> His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the [[2003 FIFA World Player of the Year]] award.<ref name=fp/>

[[Image:Thierry Henry.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Henry was made club skipper following the departure of fellow Frenchman [[Patrick Vieira]] to [[Juventus]] in 2005.]]
Entering the [[2003-04 in English football|2003<U+2013>04 season]], Arsenal were determined to reclaim the Premiership crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together with the likes of [[Dennis Bergkamp]], [[Patrick Vieira]] and [[Robert Pir<U+00E8>s]], Henry ensured that ''the Gunners'' became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league campaign unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process.<ref>Hughes, Ian, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3713537.stm "Arsenal the Invincibles"], news.bbc.co.uk, [[15 May]] [[2004]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year,<ref name=giveme/><ref name=kk/> Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for [[2004 FIFA World Player of the Year]] award.<ref name=fp/> With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the [[European Golden Boot]].<ref name=goal/><ref name=gill>[http://www.pg.com/news/gillette_champions.jhtml Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Thierry Henry Are Introduced As the Faces of the New Gillette Champions Program], pg.com/news, [[4 February]] [[2007]], accessed [[22 March]] [[2007]].</ref> However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during [[Euro 2004]].<ref name=jock/>

This dip in success was compounded when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the [[2004-05 in English football|2004&ndash;05 season]], although the club did win the FA Cup.<ref name=data/> Henry maintained his reputation as one of Europe's most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring,<ref name=goal/> and with 31 goals in all competitions,<ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=13501 Games played by Thierry Henry in 2004/2005], soccerbase.com, accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> he was the co-recipient (with [[Diego Forl<U+00E1>n]]) of the European Golden Boot.<ref name=gill/> The unexpected departure of compatriot Vieira in mid-2005 led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a position which was not naturally suited for him.<ref name=goal/> Along with being chief goal-scorer, he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully.<ref name=young>Lowem Sid, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/championsleague200506/story/0,,1715186,00.html Wenger hopes Henry will stay and usher in new era], football.guardian.co.uk, [[22 February]], [[2006]], accessed [[26 March]], [[2007]].</ref> 

The [[2005-06 in English football|2005&ndash;06 season]] proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry. On [[17 October]] [[2005]], Henry became the club's top goal-scorer of all time;<ref name=recordbreaker>Winter, Henry, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/10/22/sfnwin22.xml&sSheet=/sport/2005/10/22/ixsporttop.html "Record-breaking Henry still a master of humility"], telegraph.co.uk, [[22 October]] [[2005]], accessed [[25 March]] [[2007]].</ref> two goals against [[Sparta Prague]] in the Champions League meant he broke [[Ian Wright]]'s record of 185 goals.<ref>''China Daily''.

Nevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the league title again, but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal, who had not enjoyed much success in Europe, reached the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. The Gunners eventually lost 2&ndash;1 to [[FC Barcelona]], and Arsenal's inability to win the Premiership for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad caused much speculation that Henry would leave for another club. However, he declared his love for the club and accepted a four-year contract,<ref name=kk>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4996270.stm Henry to stay a Gunner until 2010], news.bbc.co.uk, [[19 May]] [[2006]], accessed [[21 March]] [[2007]].</ref> and said he would stay at Arsenal for life.<ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-us/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=167408 Henry Happy To End Career At Arsenal], goal.com, [[13 November]] [[2006]], accessed [[26 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Arsenal vice-chairman [[David Dein]] later claimed the club had turned down two bids of <U+00A3>50 million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the signing of the new contract.<ref name=zz>''Xinhua News''.

Henry's [[2006-07 in English football|2006<U+2013>07]] season was marred by injuries.<ref name=inj>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=419445&cc=4716 Wenger: Henry staying with Gunners], soccernet.espn.go.com, [[6 April]] [[2007]], accessed [[7 April]] [[2007]].</ref> Although he scored 10 goals in 17 domestic appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against [[PSV Eindhoven]] in a [[UEFA Champions League 2006-07|Champions League]] match,<ref name=HenryHid>Clarke, Richard, [http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&article=452739 "Wenger - The hidden benefits of having Henry"], arsenal.com, [[7 March]] [[2007]], accessed [[24 March]] [[2007]].</ref> but began limping shortly after coming on.

On [[June 25]] [[2007]], in an unexpected turn of events, Henry was transferred to FC Barcelona for <U+00A3>16.1 million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported [[euro|<U+20AC>]]6.8 (<U+00A3>4.6) million per season.<ref>[http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/06/23/headlines/headlines_30037641.php Thierry Henry signs for Barcelona], nationmultimedia.com, [[23 June]] [[2007]], accessed [[22 July]] [[2007]].</ref> It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of <U+20AC>125 (<U+00A3>84.9) million.<ref>[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/11254/Henry+seals+deal+with+Barcelona Henry seals deal with Barcelona], express.co.uk, [[25 June]] [[2007]], accessed [[28 June]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving,<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2002390000-2007281021,00.html Thierry: Why I'm going], thesun.co.uk, [[23 June]] [[2007]], accessed [[28 June]] [[2007]].</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6231950.stm Arsenal announce Henry departure], news.bbc.co.uk, [[23 June]] [[2007]], accessed [[28 June]] [[2007]].</ref> and maintained that "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal it would be to play for Barcelona."<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=441493&cc=4716 Henry hoping Wenger remains Gunners' boss], soccernet.espn.go.com, [[26 June]] [[2007]], accessed [[15 October]] [[2007]].</ref> Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to a good start for the 2007<U+2013>08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help.

At Barcelona, Henry was given the number 14 jersey as he was at Arsenal.

==International career==
Henry has had a successful career with the [[France national football team|French national team]]. His international career began in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the [[France national under-21 football team|Under-20 French national team]], where he played in the [[1997 FIFA World Youth Championship]] alongside future teammates [[William Gallas]] and [[David Trezeguet]].<ref name=goal/> Within four months, France head coach [[Aim<U+00E9> Jacquet]] called Henry up to the senior team.

On [[Bastille Day]] 1998, he was awarded France's highest decoration, the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur]].<ref name=uni/>

Henry was a member of France's [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] championship squad, again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equalizer against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the semi-final, and finishing as the country's top scorer.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/history/season=2000/round=1460/match=65183/index.html France 2-1 Portugal], uefa.com, [[28 June]] [[2000]], accessed [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref> France later won the game in [[extra time]] following a converted [[penalty kick]] by [[Zinedine Zidane]].

The [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games.<ref name=goal/> France lost their first match in group play and Henry was [[red card]]ed for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].<ref name=jock/> In that game, France played to a 0&ndash;0 draw, but Henry was forced to miss the final match due to suspension; France lost 2&ndash;0 to [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].<ref name=jock/>

Henry returned to form for his country at the [[Confederations Cup 2003|2003 Confederations Cup]]. Despite playing without team stalwarts Zinedine Zidane and [[Patrick Vieira]], France won, in large part owing to Henry's outstanding play, for which he was named [[Man of the Match]] by [[FIFA]]'s Technical Study Group in three of France's five matches.<ref name=goal/> In the final, he scored the [[golden goal]] in extra time to lift the title for the host country after a 1&ndash;0 victory over [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]].<ref name=goal/> Henry was awarded both the [[adidas]] Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament's top goal-scorer with four goals.<ref name=goal/>

He played as a lone striker, but despite an indifferent start to the tournament, became one of the top players of the World Cup. He scored three goals, including France's goal against returning champion and tournament favourite [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].<ref name=goal/> However, France subsequently lost to Italy on penalties (5&ndash;3) in the final.<ref>Stevenson, Jonathan, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991652.stm "Italy 1<U+2013>1 France (aet)"], news.bbc.co.uk, [[9 July]] [[2006]], accessed [[22 September]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry was one of 10 nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament, an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5154248.stm Sent-off Zidane named best player], news.bbc.co.uk, [[10 July]] [[2006]], accessed [[23 September]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry was named a starting striker on the 2006 [[FIFPro]] World XI team.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/5414328.stm Ronaldinho regains FifPro crown], news.bbc.co.uk, [[6 November]] [[2006]], accessed [[23 September]] [[2007]].</ref>

==Style of play==
Although Henry played up front as a striker during his youth,<ref name=tea/> he spent his time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing. When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999, Wenger immediately changed this, switching Henry to his childhood position, often pairing him with Dutch veteran [[Dennis Bergkamp]].<ref name=henryadapt/> During the 2004<U+2013>05 season, Wenger switched Arsenal's formation to [[Formation (football)#4-5-1|4-5-1]].<ref name=fourfiveone>Hatherall, Chris, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061030/ai_n16811135 "Henry defends Arsenal's pursuit of beautiful game"], ''The London Independent'', [[30 October]] [[2006]], accessed [[23 April]] [[2007]]</ref> This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit into the Arsenal team, and he played many games as a lone striker.<ref name=henryadapt/> Still, Henry remained Arsenal's main offensive threat, on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals. Wenger once said of his fellow Frenchman: "Thierry Henry could take ball in the middle of park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score".<ref>Clarke, Richard, [http://www.arsenal.com/article.asp?thisNav=news&article=477251&cpid=703&title=Wenger+-+Don%26rsquo;t+compare+Eduardo+to+Henry "Wenger - Don't compare Eduardo to Henry"], arsenal.com, accessed [[27 July]] [[2007]].</ref>

One of the reasons cited for Henry's impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones.<ref name="finishing">{{cite book | last = Mike Woitalla | first = Claudio Reyna, | title = More Than Goals: The Journey from Backyard Games to World Cup Competition | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = April 2004 | pages = 122 | isbn = 0736051716 }}</ref> This, combined with his remarkable pace, means that he can get in behind defenders regularly enough to score.<ref name=tea/><ref>Hansen, Alan, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4802114.stm Alan Hansen's column], news.bbc.co.uk, [[March 13]], [[2006]], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref> When up front, Henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position,<ref name=guidetocoaching>Jacob Daniel, ''The Complete Guide to Coaching Soccer Systems and Tactics'', pg 190, (Reedswain Inc., [[1 March]], [[2004]]).</ref><ref name=wing>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/france/newsid_1905000/1905088.stm Papin: attack at the double], bbc.co.uk, [[12 April]], [[2002]], accessed [[26 March]], [[2007]].</ref> something which enables him to contribute heavily in [[assist (football)|assists]]: between 2002&ndash;03 and 2004&ndash;05, the striker managed almost 50 assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity.<ref name=recordbreaker/> Given his versatility in being able to operate as both a winger and a striker, Henry is not a prototypical "[[Striker#Center_forward|out-and-out striker]]", but he has emerged consistently as one of Europe's most prolific strikers.<ref name=jock/> In [[set piece]]s, Henry was the first-choice [[penalty kick (football)|penalty]] and [[free kick]] taker for Arsenal, having scored regularly from those positions.<ref name=splife>[http://www.sportinglife.com/football/premiership/arsenal/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/03/08/28/SOCCER_Arsenal_Nightlead.html Henry ready to get ugly], Sporting Life, [[August 28]] [[2003]], accessed [[October 30]] [[2007]]</ref>

==Awards==
Henry has received many plaudits and awards in his football career. He was runner-up for the [[2003 FIFA World Player of the Year|2003]] and [[2004 FIFA World Player of the Year|2004]] [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award;<ref name=fp/> in those two seasons, he also won back-to-back [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] titles.<ref name=giveme/> Henry is the only player ever to have won the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]] three times (2003, 2004, 2006),<ref name=kk/> and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions.

In terms of goal-scoring awards, Henry was the [[European Golden Boot]] winner in 2004 and 2005 (sharing it with [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]]'s [[Diego Forl<U+00E1>n]] in 2005) and is the first ever player to retain the award.<ref name=gill>[http://www.pg.com/news/gillette_champions.jhtml Tiger Woods, Roger Federer and Thierry Henry Are Introduced As the Faces of the New Gillette Champions Program], pg.com/news, [[4 February]] [[2007]], accessed [[22 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry has also been the top goal-scorer in the Premiership for four seasons (2002, 2004, 2005, 2006).<ref name=goal/> In 2006, he became the first player to score more than 20 goals in the league for five consecutive seasons (2002 to 2006).<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200604/s1623218.htm Thierry Henry: The wizard of Highbury], abc.net.au, [[25 April]] [[2006]], accessed [[27 March]] [[2007]].</ref> Henry is currently third in the list of all-time English Premiership goal-scorers, behind [[Alan Shearer]] and [[Andy Cole]].

===Social causes===
Henry is a member of the [[UNICEF]]-FIFA squad, where together with other professional footballers he appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. In these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.<ref name=uni/>
