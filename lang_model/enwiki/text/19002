'''Seat Sandal''' is a [[fell]] in the [[England|English]] [[Lake District]], it is situated four kilometers north of the [[Grasmere|village of Grasmere]] from where it is very well seen. Nevertheless, it tends to be overshadowed by its more illustrious neighbours in the [[Eastern Fells]], [[Helvellyn]] and [[Fairfield (Lake District)|Fairfield]].

==Topography==
The fells western flanks above [[Dunmail Raise]] are grassy and smooth while its eastern slopes are steep and craggy as they fall away towards Grisedale Hause which at 537&nbsp;m (1,761&nbsp;ft) contains Lakeland's highest substantial tarn, Grisedale Tarn. The fell reaches a height of 736&nbsp;m (2,415&nbsp;ft) and just scrapes into the list of [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyns]] by being given [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] of "around" 150 metres from the higher fell of Fairfield, however this must be a borderline case as there is no [[Ordnance Survey]] surveyed height for the top of Grisedale Hause. [[Alfred Wainwright]] gives it a height of 1929 feet (588 metres) giving Seat Sandal a topographic prominence of only 148 metres (two metres short of Marilyn qualification). The hills unusual name comes from the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] language, meaning <U+201C>Sandulf<U+2019>s Hill Pasture<U+201D>, Sandulf being a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] personal name.

Seat Sandal is distinctive in that its [[drainage]] reaches the sea at more widely spread points than any other Lakeland Fell, with Raise Beck going through [[Thirlmere]] and [[Derwent Water]] to reach the [[Irish Sea]] at [[Workington]], Tongue Beck going through the lakes of [[Grasmere (lake)|Grasmere]] and [[Windermere (lake)|Windermere]] to reach [[Morecambe Bay]] and Grisedale Beck draining into [[Ullswater]] and then to the sea at the [[Solway Firth]]. However, this is only true as a result of the diversion of Raise Beck north to feed Thirlmere Reservoir - before this (and still today when there is enough water in Raise Beck for it to flow both north and south), [[Dollywaggon Pike]] had in this distinction - Birkside Gill feeding Thirlmere, Raise Beck feeding Grasmere, and Grisedale Beck feeding Ullswater.  The fell's main topographic attraction is Gavel Crag on its eastern side, which is connected to the main body of the fell by a fine rock arete.

Dunmail Raise provides the topographical connection between the Eastern and [[Central Fells]], [[Steel Fell]] rising on the other side of the pass.

==Geology==
A ill of [[andesite]] [[lava]] forms the summit, the rocks beneath being the [[dacite|dacitic]] [[lapilli]]-[[tuff]]s of the Lincomb Tarns Formation.<ref name="BGS">[[British Geological Survey]]: 1:50,000 series maps, ''England & Wales Sheet 29'': BGS (1999)</ref>

==Ascents==
The fell can be ascended from Grasmere or Dunmail Raise although a start from [[Patterdale]] is quite feasible. The Grasmere or Patterdale starts use the old [[packhorse]] route that links the two places; this is now part of Wainwright<U+2019>s [[Coast to Coast Walk]]. When Grisedale Hause is reached it is a steep climb to the summit following a broken wall. The ascent from Dunmail Raise follows the bed of Raise Beck until it peters out at a height of 580&nbsp;m (1,900&nbsp;ft), it is then a walk south up easy slopes to reach the summit. There is also a direct ascent up the western slopes starting at Mill Bridge.

==View==
The view from the top is limited by the nearby Helvellyn and Fairfield ranges although there is a good view of Lakeland to the west, the Solway Firth and Criffel are viewed on a good day as is Morecambe Bay to the south.
