It is situated 2<U+00BD> miles (4&nbsp;km) south of the [[Anglo-Scottish Border|Scottish border]]. It is roughly {{convert|56|mi}} east-south east of [[Edinburgh]], {{convert|65|mi}} north of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and {{convert|345|mi}} north of [[London]].  

Berwick-upon-Tweed had a population of 11,665 at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]].

Founded as an [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement during the time of the kingdom of [[Northumbria]],<ref>Lepage, Jean-Denis (2011). ''British Fortifications Through the Reign of Richard III''. McFarland. p. 272. ISBN 978-0-7864-5918-6</ref> the area was for over 400 years central to historic border war between the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and several times possession of Berwick changed hands between the two kingdoms. The last time it changed hands was when England [[capture of Berwick (1482)|retook it in 1482]]. Berwick remains a traditional [[market town]] and also has some notable architectural features, in particular its medieval [[Berwick town walls|town walls]], its Elizabethan [[Defensive wall|ramparts]] ("almost perfectly preserved and of immense architectural significance") and Britain's earliest barracks buildings (1717-21 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]] for the [[Board of Ordnance]]).<ref>Pevsner ''et al.'', Buildings of England: Northumberland, Penguin, 1992.</ref>

==Name==
The name "Berwick" is of [[Old English]] origin, and is derived from the term ''bere-w<U+012B>c'',<ref>Mills, A.D. (2003). ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-852758-9</ref> combining ''bere'', meaning "[[barley]]", and ''w<U+012B>c'', referring to a farm or settlement. "Berwick" thus means "barley village" or "barley farm".<ref>Room, Adrian (2005).

==History==

===Early history===
In the post-Roman period, the area was inhabited by the [[Brython]]s of [[Bryneich]]. Later, the region became part of the [[Angles|Anglian]] kingdom of [[Bernicia]]. Bernicia later united with the kingdom of [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]] to form [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], which in the mid-10th century entered the [[Kingdom of England]] under [[Eadred]].<ref>Kendrick, T.

===Scottish town===

Between the late 10th and early 11th centuries, the land between the rivers [[River Forth|Forth]] and Tweed  came under Scottish control, either through conquest or through [[cession]].<ref>Barrow, G.

While under Scottish control, Berwick was referred to as "South Berwick" in order to differentiate it from the town of [[North Berwick]], [[East Lothian]], near Edinburgh.<ref>[http://www.north-berwick.co.uk/town_history.asp www.north-berwick.co.uk]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>

Berwick's strategic position on the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] during centuries of war between the two nations and its relatively great wealth led to a succession of raids, sieges and takeovers. [[William I of Scotland]] invaded and attempted to capture northern England in 1173-74.<ref>Wormald, Jenny (2005). ''Scotland: A History''. Oxford University Press. p. 46.

According to [[William Edington]], a bishop and chancellor of Scotland, Berwick was  "so populous and of such commercial importance that it might rightly be called another [[Alexandria]], whose riches were the sea and the water its walls".<ref>Eric Robson, ''[http://books.google.com.ar/books?id=AEOaUkge9DMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+border+line&hl=de&sa=X&ei=uGiYT-TRPJDZ4QSpzJnFBg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false The Border Line]'', p. 234.</ref> In 1291/92, Berwick was the site of [[Edward I of England]]'s arbitration in the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|contest for the Scottish crown]] between [[John Balliol]] and [[Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale]].<ref name=dunbar116>Dunbar, Sir Archibald H.,Bt., ''Scottish Kings - A Revised Chronology of Scottish History 1005 - 1625'', Edinburgh, 1899: p. 116</ref> The decision in favour of Balliol was pronounced in the Great Hall of [[Berwick Castle]] on 17 November 1292.<ref name=dunbar116/> 

[[File:Berwick heyheydecay.net .jpg|thumb|right|Part of the [[Berwick town walls|town walls]]]]
In 1296 England went to war with [[France]], with whom Scotland was in alliance. Balliol invaded England in response, sacking [[Cumberland]].<ref>Baker, Charles-Arnold (2001). ''The Companion to British History''. Routledge. p. 91. ISBN 978-0-415-18583-7</ref> Edward in turn invaded Scotland and [[Capture of Berwick (1296)|captured Berwick]], destroying much of the town. Edward I went again to Berwick in August 1296 to [[Ragman Rolls|receive formal homage]] from some 2,000 Scottish nobles, after defeating the Scots at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1296)|Battle of Dunbar]] in April and forcing John Balliol to abdicate at [[Kincardine Castle, Mearns|Kincardine Castle]] the following July. It was at this time that work began on building the town walls (and rebuilding the earlier Castle); these fortifications were complete by 1318 and subsequently improved under Scottish rule. An arm of [[William Wallace]] was displayed at Berwick after his execution and quartering on 23 August 1305. In 1314 [[Edward II of England]] mustered 25,000 men at Berwick, who later fought in (and lost) the [[Battle of Bannockburn]].

Between 1315 and 1318, Scottish armies, sometimes with the help of Flemish and German [[privateer]]s, besieged and [[blockaded]] the town, finally [[Capture of Berwick (1318)|invading and capturing it in April 1318]].<ref>Rogers, Clifford J.

In 1461 Berwick was ceded back to Scotland by [[Margaret of Anjou]] on behalf of her husband, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], in return for help against the [[Yorkists]] during the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref>Wagner, John (2001). ''Encyclopedia of the War of the Roses''. ABC-CLIO. p. 28. ISBN 978-1-85109-358-8</ref>  Robert Lauder of [[Edrington]] was put in charge of the castle. He was succeeded in 1474 by [[David Lindsay, 1st Duke of Montrose|David, Earl of Crawford]]. On 3 February 1478, [[Robert Lauder of The Bass]] and Edrington was again appointed Keeper of the castle, a position that he held until the last year of Scottish occupation, when [[Patrick Hepburn]], 1st Lord Hailes, had possession.

Berwick had a mediaeval hospital for the sick and poor which was administered by the Church. A charter under the [[Great Seal of Scotland]], confirmed by King [[James I of Scotland]], grants the king's chaplain "[[Thomas Lauder]] of the House of God or Hospital lying in the burgh of Berwick-upon-Tweed, to be held to him for the whole time of his life with all lands, teinds, rents and profits, etc., belonging to the said hospital, as freely as is granted to any other hospital in the Kingdom of Scotland; the king also commands all those concerned to pay to the grantee all things necessary for the support of the hospital. Dated at Edinburgh June 8, in the 20th year of his reign."

===English town===
[[File:Berwick on Tweed Fortress Detail.JPG|thumb|right|Berwick on Tweed Fortress Detail]]

In 1551, the town was made a [[county corporate]]. During the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], vast sums <U+2013> one source reports "<U+00A3>128,648, the most expensive undertaking of the Elizabethan period"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berwick.org.uk/berwick/berwick.htm |title=www.berwick.org.uk |publisher=www.berwick.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref> <U+2013> were spent on its fortifications, in a new Italian style (''[[Star fort|trace italienne]]''), designed both to withstand artillery and to facilitate its use from within the fortifications. These fortifications have been described as "the only surviving walls of their kind".<ref name="Cannon, John 2009 p. 474"/> [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Sir Richard Lee]] designed some of the Elizabethan works.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth 1559<U+2013>1560'', Longman (1865), no. 1064, "setting forth the device"</ref> 

In 1639 the army of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] faced that of General [[Alexander Leslie]] at Berwick in the [[Bishops' Wars]], which were concerned with bringing the [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] under Charles's control. The two sides did not fight, but negotiated a settlement, "Pacification of Berwick", in June.<ref>Seel, Graham E. (1999). ''The English Wars and Republic, 1637-1660''. Routledge. p. 2.

===British town===
[[File:The Barracks - geograph.org.uk - 1254528.jpg|thumbnail|The Barracks (1717-21)]]
In 1707, the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] between England and Scotland largely ended the contention about which of the countries Berwick belonged to. Since then, Berwick remained within the laws and legal system of [[England and Wales]]. The [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] (since repealed) deemed that whenever legislation referred to England it applied to Berwick. England now is officially defined as "subject to any alteration of boundaries under Part IV of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the area consisting of the counties established by section 1 of that Act, Greater London and the Isles of Scilly.",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&title=Interpretation+Act++&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&TYPE=QS&NavFrom=0&activeTextDocId=1838152&PageNumber=1&SortAlpha=0 |title=Schedule 1 of The Interpretation Act 1978 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref> which thus includes Berwick.

Berwick remained a county in its own right, and was not included in [[Northumberland]] for Parliamentary purposes until 1885. In the same year, the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|Redistribution of Seats Act]] reduced the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) returned by the town from two to one.

On 1 April 1974, the [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (borough)|Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed]] was created by the merger of the previous borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed with Belford Rural District, Glendale Rural District and [[Norham and Islandshires Rural District]].

The [[Interpretation Act 1978]] provides that in legislation passed between 1967 and 1974, "a reference to England includes Berwick upon Tweed and [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]".

In 2008, [[Scottish National Party]] [[Member of Scottish Parliament]] (MSP) [[Christine Grahame]] made calls in the [[Scottish Parliament]] for Berwick to become part of Scotland again, saying, "Even the Berwick-upon-Tweed Borough Council leader, who is a Liberal Democrat, backs the idea and others see the merits of reunification with Scotland."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/7237802.stm | title = 'Return to fold' call for Berwick | accessdate = 2008-07-15  | work=BBC News | date=10 February 2008}}</ref> The Liberal Democrat MSP [[Jeremy Purvis]], who was born and brought up in Berwick, also asked for the border to be moved twenty miles south (i.e., a significant distance south of the Tweed) to include Berwick borough council rather than just the town. stating: "There<U+2019>s a strong feeling that Berwick should be in Scotland. Until recently, I had a gran in Berwick and another in [[Kelso, Scottish Borders|Kelso]], and they could see that there were better public services in Scotland.

In 2009, the Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed was abolished as part of [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|wider structural changes to local government in England]]. All functions previously exercised by Berwick Borough Council were transferred to [[Northumberland County Council]], which is the [[unitary authority]] for the area.

==Governance==
[[File:Berwick Town Hall 2.jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|The Town Hall (1754) houses a ring of bells above the Council chamber and a former gaol.]]
During periods of Scottish administration Berwick was the [[county town]] of [[Berwickshire]], to which the town gave its name. Thus at various points in the Middle Ages and from 1482 (when Berwick became administrated by England) Berwickshire had the unique distinction of being the only county in the British Isles to be named after a town in another country.<ref>Kay, John/Keay, Julia (2000). ''Collins Encyclopedia of Scotland''. HarperCollins. p. 78. ISBN 978-0-00-710353-9</ref>

The town of Berwick was a [[county corporate]] for most purposes from 1482, up until 1885, when it was fully incorporated into [[Northumberland]]. Between 1885, and 1974, Berwick (north of the Tweed) was a borough council in its own right, and then on 1 April 1974 it was merged with Belford Rural District, Glendale Rural District and [[Norham and Islandshires Rural District]].

During these periods, [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (borough)|Berwick Borough Council]] and  Berwickshire County Council (or District Council) existed, both named after the same town, but covering entirely different areas.

The Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed was abolished on 1 April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/494/contents/made |title=The Northumberland (Structural Change) Order 2008 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-05}}</ref>  From that date, [[Northumberland County Council]] assumed its functions, and those of the other districts in its area, to become a unitary authority.

A new Berwick-upon-Tweed Town Council, a [[Parish councils in England|parish council]], has been created covering Berwick-upon-Tweed, Tweedmouth and Spittal. It is expected to take over the former Borough's mayoralty and regalia.

Berwick-upon-Tweed is in the [[British House of Commons|parliamentary]] constituency of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]].

==Economy==
[[File:Berwick Town In Winter.jpg|thumb|right|Berwick on Tweed Main High Street]]
Slightly more than 60% of the population is employed in the service sector, including shops, hotels and catering, financial services and most government activity, including health care. About 13% is in manufacturing, 10% in agriculture, and 8% in construction.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/themesub.jsp?u_id=10211992&data_theme=T_IND&id=4 Employment]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Some current and recent Berwick economic activities include [[salmon]] fishing, shipbuilding, engineering, [[sawmill]]ing, [[fertilizer]] production, and the manufacture of tweed and hosiery.

Berwick town centre comprises the Mary Gate and High Street where many local shops and some retail chains exist. There is a small supermarket in the vicinity too. A new office development has been built in the Walker Gate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Published on Wednesday 6 March 2013 11:41 |url=http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/news/business/local-business/berwick-workspace-reaping-the-benefits-of-european-funding-1-2744029 |title=Berwick Advertiser |publisher=Berwick Advertiser |date=2013-03-06 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref>

There is a retail park in Tweedmouth consisting of some units.

A [[Morrisons]] supermarket and petrol station, alongside a branch of [[McDonald's]], a [[Travelodge UK]] and an Aldi all exist on Loaning Meadows close to the outskirts of the town near the current A1.

==Transport==
The old [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] passes through Berwick. The modern A1 goes around the town to the west. The town is on the [[East Coast Main Line]] railway, and has a [[Berwick-upon-Tweed railway station|railway station]]. A small seaport at Tweedmouth facilitates the import and export of goods, but provides no passenger service

==Culture==

===Berwick dialect===
The local speech of Berwick-upon-Tweed shares many characteristics with both other rural [[Northumberland]] dialects and East [[Central Scots]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/INTRO/map.php?num=2 |title=Snd Maps |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/INTRO/intro2.php?num=16 |title=Snd Introduction |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-09}}</ref> In 1892, [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Richard Oliver Heslop]] divided the county of Northumberland into four dialect zones and placed the Berwick dialect in the "north-Northumbrian" region, an area extending from Berwick down to the [[River Coquet]].<ref>Simmelbauer, Andrea (2000). ''The Dialect of Northumberland: A Lexical Investigation''. C. Winter. p. 17. ISBN 978-3-8253-0934-3</ref> Likewise, Charles Jones (1997) classes the dialect as "predominantly North-Northumbrian" with "a few features shared with [[Scots language|Scots]]".<ref>Jones, Charles (1997). ''The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language''. Edinburgh University Press. p. 512. ISBN 978-0-7486-0754-9</ref> 

Features of this dialect include the "[[Northumbrian Burr]]", a distinct pronunciation of the letter [[R]] historically common to many dialects of the [[North East England|North East]] of England;<ref>Llamas, Carmen et al. (2006). ''The Routledge Companion to Sociolinguistics''. Routledge. p. 7. ISBN 978-0415338509</ref> and predominant [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhoticity]]: older speakers tend to be slightly rhotic, while younger speakers are universally non-rhotic.<ref>Llamas, Carmen et al. (2006). ''The Routledge Companion to Sociolinguistics''. Routledge. p. 8. ISBN 978-0415338509. "Non-rhoticity appears to be (near-)categorical for all speakers. Even the eldest speaker uses non-rhotic pronunciations almost 90 per cent of the time. These data suggest, then, that Berwick English is now effectively established as a non-rhotic variety, and has thereby converged on mainstream [[English English]]."</ref><ref>[http://www.meertens.knaw.nl/ss17/contributions/abstract.php?paperID=560 Rhoticity in four Scottish/English border localities] "could be argued on the basis of the data in Watt (2006) that Berwick English is increasingly convergent with other non-rhotic English varieties in northern England, and increasingly divergent from Scottish varieties with which it has traditionally shared numerous properties" April 2008. Verified 23 October 2008.</ref>

A sociological study of the [[English-Scottish border]] region conducted in 2000 found that locals of [[Alnwick]], {{convert|30|mi}} south of Berwick, associated the Berwick accent with Scottish influence. Conversely, those from [[Eyemouth]], Scotland, {{convert|9|mi}} north of Berwick, firmly classed Berwick speech as English, identifying it as "Northumbrian or [[Geordie]]".<ref>Llamas, Carmen and Watt, Dominic (2010). ''Language and Identities''. Edinburgh University Press. p. 230. ISBN 978-0-7486-3577-1</ref>

===Sport===
[[Berwick Rangers F.C.]] were formed in the town in 1881.<ref>Cox, Richard (2002). ''Encyclopedia of British Football''. Routledge. p. 342. ISBN 978-0-7146-5249-8</ref> Despite being located in England the club plays in the [[Scottish Football League]] to make the distances travelled by fans shorter. The home stadium of Berwick Rangers is [[Shielfield Park]]. The club currently plays in the [[Scottish Third Division]].

The town also has a [[rugby union]] side, [[Berwick RFC]] who play in [[Scottish Rugby Union]]'s [[East Regional Leagues (Rugby Union)|East Regional League Division 1]].

[[Motorcycle speedway|Speedway]] has taken place in Berwick in two separate eras. The sport was introduced to Shielfield Park in May 1968. A dispute between the speedway club and the stadium owners ended the first spell. The sport returned to Shielfield Park in the mid-1990s. The lack of a venue in the town saw the team move to a rural location called Berrington Lough. The team, known as the Bandits, have raced at all levels from First Division to Conference League (first to third levels).

Berwick Rangers and Berwick RFC are unique in that they are English teams that operate within Scottish leagues, although at one point the now-defunct [[Gretna F.C.]], based in [[Gretna, Scotland|Gretna]], played in the English football system.<ref>Duke, Vic/Crolley, Liz.

There is an [[apocrypha]]l story that Berwick is (or recently was) technically at war with Russia.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0p9YmWAtOU |title=QI - Season 3 - Episode 7 - Constellations |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-06-10 |accessdate=2013-03-13}}</ref> The story tells that since Berwick had changed hands several times, it was traditionally regarded as a special, separate entity, and some proclamations referred to "England, Scotland and the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed". One such was the declaration of the [[Crimean War]] against Russia in 1853, which [[Queen Victoria]] supposedly signed as "Victoria, Queen of Great Britain, Ireland, Berwick-upon-Tweed and all British Dominions". When the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] was signed to conclude the war, "Berwick-upon-Tweed" was left out. This meant that, supposedly, one of Britain's smallest towns was officially at war with one of the world's largest powers <U+2013> and the conflict [[List of wars extended by diplomatic irregularity|extended by the lack of a peace treaty]] for over a century.<ref name=Culture/>

The [[BBC]] programme ''[[Nationwide (TV series)|Nationwide]]'' investigated this story in the 1970s, and found that while Berwick was not mentioned in the Treaty of Paris, it was not mentioned in the declaration of war either. The question remained as to whether Berwick had ever been at war with Russia in the first place. The true situation is that since the [[Wales and Berwick Act 1746]] had already made it clear that all references to England included Berwick, the town had no special status at either the start or end of the war.  The grain of truth in this legend could be that some important documents from the 17th century did mention Berwick separately, but this became unnecessary after 1746.

According to a story by George Hawthorne in ''The Guardian'' of 28 December 1966, the London correspondent of ''Pravda'' visited the Mayor of Berwick, Councillor [[Robert Knox (politician)|Robert Knox]], and the two made a mutual declaration of peace. Knox said "Please tell the Russian people through your newspaper that they can sleep peacefully in their beds." The same story, cited to the Associate Press, appeared in ''The Baltimore Sun'' of 17 December 1966; ''The Washington Post'' of 18 December 1966; and ''The Christian Science Monitor'' of 22 December 1966. At some point in turn the real events seem to have been turned into a story of a "Soviet official" having signed a "peace treaty" with Mayor Knox; Knox's remark to the ''Pravda'' correspondent was preserved in this version.<ref name=Culture>{{cite web| last = Graham| first = Spicer| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Myth Or Reality?

*Berwick Barracks, now maintained by [[English Heritage]], and built between 1717 and 1721, the design attributed to [[Nicholas Hawksmoor|Hawksmoor]].
*[[Berwick town walls]] and Elizabethan ramparts <U+2013> some of the finest remaining examples of their type in the country.
*The [[Berwick Bridge|Old Bridge]], 15-span [[sandstone]] arch bridge measuring 1,164 feet in length, built between 1610 and 1624, at a cost of [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]15,000. The bridge continues to serve road traffic, but in one direction only. The bridge, part of the main route from [[London]] to [[Edinburgh]] was ordered by [[James VI of Scotland]].
*The [[Royal Border Bridge]], designed and built under the supervision of [[Robert Stephenson]] in 1847 at a cost of <U+00A3>253,000, is a 720-yard-long [[railway]] [[viaduct]] with 28 arches, carrying the [[East Coast Main Line]] 126 feet above the River Tweed. It was opened by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1850.
*The [[Royal Tweed Bridge]], built in 1925 and in its time having the longest concrete span in the country at 361 feet, was originally designed to carry the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]] across the Tweed; the town now has a road bypass to the west. In the early 2000s, its fabric was renovated, the road and pavement layout amended, and new street lighting added.

*The Guildhall, built in 1750 in a Classical style, and formerly housing the town's prison on the top floor.

The building, constructed around 1650 using stone from the 13th-century castle (parts of which still stand by the railway station), began as a plain preaching box, with no steeple, stained glass or other decorations. Much altered with a conventional interior layout, contents include a pulpit thought to have been built for John Knox during his stay in the town.
*Much of [[Berwick Castle]] was demolished in the 19th century to make way for the [[East Coast Main Line|railway]] (having fallen into disrepair by the 17th century), but substantial ruins remain, just outside the town's rampart walls to the west by the river.
*[[Dewars Lane]] Runs down Back Street just off Bridge Street, and, like other Berwick locations, was painted by [[LS Lowry]]. The painter was a frequent visitor to Berwick, especially in the 1930s, when he stayed at the Castle Hotel.<ref>[http://www.familytraits.co.uk/berwick_upon_tweed_moments_in_time.html www.familytraits.co.uk]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref>
