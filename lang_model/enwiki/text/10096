:''This article is about the [[Formula One]] driver. For the murder of a man also called "Tom Pryce", see [[Murder of Tom ap Rhys Pryce]].

'''Thomas Maldwyn Pryce''' ([[June 11]], [[1949]] &ndash; [[March 5]], [[1977]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Formula One]] racing driver from [[Wales]]. He was famous for winning the [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Brands Hatch Race of Champions]] in 1975 and for the circumstances surrounding his death. Pryce is also the only [[Welsh people|Welshman]] to lead a Formula One Grand Prix: two laps of the [[1975 British Grand Prix]].

Pryce started his career in Formula One with the small [[Token (Racing team)|Token]] team, making his only start for the them at the [[1974 Belgian Grand Prix]]. Shortly after an impressive performance at the [[Formula Three]] support race for the [[1974 Monaco Grand Prix]], Pryce joined the [[Shadow Racing Team|Shadow]] team and scored his first points in [[1974 German Grand Prix|Germany]] in only his fourth race. Pryce later claimed two podium finishes, his first in [[1975 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]] in 1975 and the second in [[1976 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] a year later. Pryce was considered by his team as a great wet weather driver. During the practice session for the 1977 South African GP, run in wet conditions, Pryce was faster than everyone, including world champion drivers [[Niki Lauda]] and [[James Hunt]]. Pryce's third full season at Shadow was cut short by his fatal accident at the [[1977 South African Grand Prix]], where he collided at high speed with track marshal Jansen Van Vuuren.

In 2007, it was announced that a statue of Pryce would be erected in his home town of [[Ruthin]] by the local council to mark the 30th anniversary of the Welshman's death.

==Personal and early life==
Tom Pryce was born in [[Ruthin]], [[Denbighshire]], [[Wales]] to Jack and Gwyneth Pryce. Jack had worked in the [[Royal Air Force]], as a tailgunner on a [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bomber]], before joining the local police force. Gwyneth was a [[district nurse]].<ref name="Beginnings 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 27}}</ref> Pryce's older brother, David, died at the age of three leaving Tom an only child for much of the time he was growing up, although his parents did foster a young girl called Sandra for a while.<ref name="Beginnings 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne |authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 28}}</ref>

Pryce took an interest in cars while driving a baker's van at the age of 10, before informing his parents that he wanted to be a racing driver. However, during an interview with [[Alan Henry]] in 1975, he stated that he had wanted to become a [[Aviator|pilot]], but thought he wasn't intelligent enough.<ref name="Beginnings 2" /> Like many future Formula One drivers, Pryce had a childhood racing hero. In his case it was [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]' [[Scotland|Scottish]] driver [[Jim Clark]].<ref name="Beginnings 1" /> Pryce's mother recalled that he was very upset when Clark died at the [[Hockenheimring]] in the Spring of [[1968]]. His father also noted that "he was very upset when [[Jochen Rindt]] was killed, too".<ref name="Beginnings 1" /> After he left school at 16, Pryce's mother insisted on him taking an apprenticeship as a tractor mechanical at Llandrillo Technical College, giving him "something to fall back on", as she put it, if his career as a racing driver was not successful.<ref name="Beginnings 2" />

In 1975 Pryce married Fenella, more commonly known as Nella, whom he met at a disco in [[Otford]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 120}}</ref> Following the death of her husband, Nella went on to run an antiques store in [[Fulham]] with Janet Brise, [[Tony Brise]]'s widow.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 257}}</ref>

==Helmet design==
Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in comparison to later drivers', basic. His helmet was white all over until, in 1970, when Pryce was racing at [[Castle Combe Circuit|Castle Combe]], his father asked Tom to make his helmet stand out more so that he could identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor.<ref name="Helmet">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 34}}</ref> From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a [[Flag of Wales|Welsh flag]] to the side of his helmet in 1974. [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] was the only sponsor name ever to appear on Pryce's helmet.

==Career==
===Pre-Formula One===
====1969<U+2013>1971: Early years====
Pryce's first steps into motor racing came at the [[Mallory Park]] circuit in [[Leicestershire]] when he was 20 years old. Pryce was put through his paces by [[Trevor Taylor]], an ex-[[Team Lotus]] driver and old team mate of Pryce's childhood hero Clark. He later became a star in the [[Formula 5000]] series. From there, Pryce went on to compete in the ''[[Daily Express]] Crusader Championship'', a series run by ''Motor Racing Stables'' for racing school pupils using [[Lotus 51]] [[Formula Ford]] cars. Races alternated between the [[Brands Hatch]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] circuits, Pryce made his debut at the former. "The races were [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]35 a time. But I sold my [[Mini]] and my parents offered all the help and encouragement I could wish for" Pryce recalled to [[Alan Henry]].<ref name="Early Career 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22|pages=p. 29}}</ref>

The prize for the overall winner of the series was a [[Formula Ford]] [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola T200]] worth <U+00A3>1,500. The series was decided at the last round, held at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]], the day before the 1970 Formula One [[International Trophy]].<ref name="Early Career 1" /> Pryce qualified on the third row for the race, which was held in rainy weather. Jack Pryce remembered that his son was rubbing his hands in delight: "he always loved racing in the rain". The early part of the race was led by a driver called Chris Smith but then heavy rain started and Pryce was able to catch up to Smith and overtake him before winning the race by a comfortable margin. He was given his prize Lola by [[Sir Max Aitken, 2nd Baronet|Sir Max Aitken]].<ref name="Early Career 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22|pages=p. 30}}</ref>

Pryce took his new car to Brands Hatch, where he was allowed to house it in one of the old stables at the bottom of the paddock.<ref name="Early Career 2" /> Pryce soon abandoned his farming career and moved to a guesthouse in [[West Kingsdown]], near the Brands Hatch circuit.<ref name="Early Career 3">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22|pages=p. 31}}</ref> Pryce continued to make a name for himself during 1971, entering a new twin-seater Sportscar category called ''Formula F100'', which he won with what was described by motorsports author [[David Tremayne]] as "embarrassing ease". He then moved up to [[Formula Vee|Formula SuperVee]], driving a Royale RP9, which was the car of choice at the time,<ref name="F100">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22 |pages=p. 35}}</ref> and soon made his [[Formula Three]] debut for the same manufacturer at Brands Hatch.

====1972<U+2013>1973: Lower Formulae====
{{quotebox|"I was fiddling about with the car when I suddenly saw [Peter] Lamplough coming straight towards me. I just couldn't believe it - I froze on the spot.

In that race at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to first place in the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]] against many established Formula Three drivers such as [[Roger Williamson]], [[Jochen Mass]] and [[James Hunt]].<ref name="F3 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22|pages=p. 56}}</ref> So large was Pryce's advantage at the end of the race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight, although it turned out that that the circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had in fact been underweight.<ref name="F3 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22|pages=p. 60}}</ref> Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at [[Oulton Park]] and [[Zandvoort]], and then during practice for the support race of the [[1972 Monaco Grand Prix]] his car came to a stop at ''Casino Square'' after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.<ref name="F3 3" />

The Welshman was back in action two weeks after his incident in Monaco. Pryce also ran in the Formula SuperVee series, winning the series by a comfortable margin, "I won just about every race I went in for" Pryce recalled. A run with Royale's [[Formula Atlantic]] works team was also in store for Pryce during 1972, where he took [[pole position]] for the final three rounds of the championship and won the final round at Brand Hatch.<ref name="FormulaVee 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22|pages=p. 62}}</ref>

He continued racing in Formula Atlantic in 1973, winning three races.<ref name="Stardom Beckons 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22 |pages=p. 70}}</ref> Royale soon had plans to enter [[Formula Two]], such was the Welshman's talent.<ref name="Stardom Beckons 1" /> The ambition to run in the Formula Two championship was planned to be financially fuelled by a [[Liechtenstein]] driver Manfred Schurti. However, these plans only resulted in one of Royale's F2 cars being built before the project was scrapped and Bob King, the head of Royale, leaving the company.

Following an invitation to test of his cars, Pryce found himself racing in the Formula Two series with [[Ron Dennis]]' ''Rondel Racing'' outfit, his best result for the team came at the [[Norisring]] where he was leading the race until a brake failure meant he had to give up first place to team mate [[Tim Schenken]].<ref name="GP Encyclopedia">{{cite web |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-prytom.html |title=GP Encyclopedia > Drivers > Tom Pryce |accessdate=2006-09-11 |accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=GrandPrix.com |pages= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060220092700/http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-prytom.html |archivedate=2006-02-20 |quote= }}</ref>  At the end of 1973, Pryce won the Grovewood award for his efforts during the year. Jack Pryce recalled that his son did not want to win the award, as he thought it was "a jinx on a driver's career".<ref name="Stardom Beckons 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-22|pages=p. 72}}</ref>

===Formula One===
====1974: Token====
{{mainarticle|Token (Racing team)}}
At the age of 25, Pryce graduated to Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, joining the newly formed [[Token (Racing team)|Token Racing]] team. The team itself was created by Tony Vlassopulos and Ken Grob after the original Token team closed down in 1973 due to a lack of finanicial backing; which lead to the end of the ''Rondel Racing'' outfit. Pryce was given the seat thanks to his backing from Titan Properties and, what David Tremayne desribed as, "evident promise".<ref name="Peterson Speculation 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen. |accessdate=2007-03-26 |pages=p. 127-129}}</ref> Pryce made his debut for the team at the [[BRDC International Trophy]], a non-championship Formula One event held at Silverstone, but lack of an [[airbox]] and an engine cover, along with his shortage of experience in the car, made him the slowest driver of the 16 competitors during qualifying: 26 seconds slower than [[James Hunt]]'s [[Hesketh Racing|Hesketh]] in pole position.<ref name="Token">{{cite web |url=http://www.f1rejects.com/teams/token/profile.html |title=Token Profile |accessdate=2006-09-26 |accessmonthday= |accessyear= |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2003-09-15 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=F1Rejects.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070305171114/http://f1rejects.com/teams/token/profile.html |archivedate=2006-02-13 |quote= }}</ref> The Welshman retired 15 laps into the race with a gear linkage problem. Pryce's World Championship debut came at the [[1974 Belgian Grand Prix]], where he qualified in 20th place, 3 seconds slower then the fastest time set by [[Clay Regazzoni]]. Once again, he failed to finish, completing 66 laps before retiring after a collision with [[Jody Scheckter]]'s [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]] left the [[Token RJ02|RJ02]]'s front-left [[wishbone]] broken.

Pryce was refused entry to the [[1974 Monaco Grand Prix|1974 Monaco Formula One Grand Prix]], as he was deemed "inexperienced".<ref name="Token" /> Instead, Pryce took part in the supporting [[Formula 3]] race, driving for ''Ippokampos Racing'', in a [[March Engineering|March]] 743, which he won by a 20.8&nbsp;seconds.<ref name="Monaco F3 results">{{cite web |url=http://www.formula2.net/F374_18.htm |title=1974 Monaco F3 Support Race results |accessdate=2007-03-15|date=2003-08-04|publisher=Formula2.net}}</ref>

Following his impressive drive in Monaco, and a [[1974 European Formula Two season|short spell]] in [[Formula Two]],<ref name="Formula Two 1974">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 135-136}}</ref> Pryce was signed by Shadow as replacement for [[Brian Redman]], who had in turn replaced the late [[Peter Revson]].<ref name="GPRacing.net">{{cite web |url=http://www.gpracing.net192.com/drivers/careers/471.cfm |title=Tom Pryce Profile at GPRacing.net |accessdate=2006-03-14 |publisher=GPRacing.net}}</ref> Pryce made his debut for the team at [[1974 Dutch Grand Prix|Zandvoort]]; retiring on the first lap after a collision with [[Hans Joachim Stuck]]. Pryce qualified fourth in his second Grand Prix for the team in [[1974 French Grand Prix|France]], but a collision with [[James Hunt]] meant yet another early exit. Later in the season, Pryce received 100 bottles of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] for finishing fastest in the practice session for his [[1974 British Grand Prix|home Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]]. He went on to qualify on the fourth row of the starting grid.

Pryce scored the first point of his career in the [[1974 German Grand Prix]], after finishing 6th from 11th on the grid, he then qualified in 16th for the next Grand Prix in [[1974 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]], but spun off on lap 22, ending his race. Although he qualified in 22nd place for the [[1974 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], Pryce finished 12 places higher. However, the season ended miserably, with an engine failure in [[1974 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], and the Shadow severely off the pace in [[1974 United States Grand Prix|America]]. At the end of the season Pryce was equal 18th in the Drivers' Championship with [[Graham Hill]] and [[Vittorio Brambilla]].

However, on lap 21, Pryce span out of the race after coming across a wet patch of rain at ''Becketts''.]]

At the start of the [[1975 Formula One season|1975 season]], Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by [[Colin Chapman]], who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's progress throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus was experiencing financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and [[Sweden|Swede]] [[Ronnie Peterson]]. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team.<ref name="Peterson Speculation 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 150}}</ref> The deal never materialised, however, although Shadow team manager [[Alan Rees]] claims that it came very close to being completed.<ref name="Peterson Speculation 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen. |accessdate=2007-01-05 |pages=p. 152}}</ref>

Pryce's Shadow team mate, [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]], outqualified him in the early part of the 1975 season, as the French driver had the new Shadow DN5 car, while Pryce was in the older DN3.<ref name="Shadow DN5 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne |authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05 |pages=p. 151}}</ref>. It wasn't until the third round, the [[1975 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]], that Pryce was able to use a DN5.<ref name="DN5 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05 ||pages=p. 153}}</ref> The team's fourth race of the season was the non-championship [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]] held at [[Brands Hatch]]. Pryce qualified on pole position and, following a poor start, passed  Peterson and [[Jacky Ickx]] before closing an eight second gap to race leader Jody Scheckter, whose engine failed while Pryce harried him,<ref name="RoC">{{cite book |last=Gill (ed.)|title=1976  Motorsport yearbook|pages=pp.96-97}}</ref> letting Pryce through to become the first Welshman to win a Formula One race.<ref name="First Welsh Winner">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05 |pages=p. 158}}</ref> Pryce showed other signs of promise during the season, most notably in [[1975 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] and [[1975 British Grand Prix|Britain]] where he qualified on the front row of the grid, the latter being in pole position. Pryce also achieved his first World Championship podium finish, in extremely wet conditions at the [[1975 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]] and finished in the points four more times. The highest of those came in [[1975 German Grand Prix|Germany]] where he finished fourth, despite the fact that fuel had been leaking into the cockpit of his DN5 during the final laps around the [[N<U+00FC>rburgring]], reportedly "searing his skin and almost blinding him with fumes".<ref name="nurburg">{{cite book |last=Gill (ed.)|title=1976  Motorsport yearbook|pages=pp.73-75}}</ref> The Welshman later received the ''Prix Rouge et Blanc Jo Siffert award'', named after the Swiss [[Jo Siffert|Formula One driver]], for this achievement.<ref name="Germany '75">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-02-21 |pages=p. 189}}</ref>

In his book ''[[The Lost Generation (book)|The Lost Generation]]'', [[David Tremayne]] asked what Pryce might have achieved in the same car had he accepted the move to the team in [[1975 Formula One season|1975]].<ref name="Tremayne 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05 ||pages=p. 244}}</ref>]]

Prior to the start of the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]], Pryce and [[David Richards (racing)|Dave Richards]], future head of the [[Prodrive]] motorsports engineering company, entered a [[Lancia]] [[Lancia Stratos|Stratos]] in the Tour of Epynt, a [[Rallying|rally]] event contested by many established rallying names. Unfortunately for Pryce, he crashed into a bridge only 10 miles into the first stage, but he still competed in the afternoon stages after his car was rebuilt.<ref name="Pryce Rally driver">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 214-218}}</ref>

Once the Formula One World Championship season got under way Pryce instantly added a second podium finish to his tally, at the first round in [[1976 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]]. This came at the expense of continuing team mate Jarier, who was caught out by oil on the track from James Hunt's [[McLaren]]. Both Shadows enjoyed reasonable competitiveness during the next two races at [[1976 South African Grand Prix|Kyalami]] and [[1976 United States Grand Prix West|Long Beach]]. However, changes in car regulations, meaning that teams had to lower their airboxes and mount the cars' rear wings further forward, along with revised [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tyres, meant the Shadow DN5B lost much of its competitiveness although Pryce achieved a second points scoring finish of the season in [[1976 British Grand Prix|Britain]].<ref name="Shadow DN5B">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 218}}</ref>. The new Shadow DN8 was not introduced until the twelfth round at [[1976 Dutch Grand Prix|Zandvoort]], where Pryce qualified the new car in third, and finished the race only one place lower in fourth: it would be the last points scoring finish of Pryce's career. The Welshman finished his last full season 12th in the Drivers' Championship with 10 points, 59 points behind World Champion James Hunt.

;1977
Jarier left Shadow before the start of the [[1977 Formula One season]], for [[ATS (wheels)|ATS]], and was replaced by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renzo Zorzi]]. Zorzi was later rated by [[Jackie Oliver]], who was part of the managerial team at Shadow, as "the worst driver we [the Shadow team] ever had".<ref name="Zorzi comment">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 252}}</ref> However, the new signing brought in sponsorship from Italy, easing Shadow's financial position. Pryce started the first race of the year in [[1977 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]] in ninth place and stayed with the leading group until a gear linkage failure on the 45th lap of the 52 lap race. Following a long pit stop to fix the fault, he was not classified. Pryce qualified 12th for the second round in [[1977 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], but on lap 34 retired from the race, while running in second place, as the result of an engine failure.

==Death==
Tom Pryce began his final race weekend, the [[1977 South African Grand Prix]] at [[Kyalami]], by setting fastest time in the Wednesday practice session, held in wet weather. Pryce posted a time of 1 minute 31.57 seconds with the next best, the eventual 1977 World Champion [[Niki Lauda]], a full second slower. The weather dried up prior to the Thursday session, and so he slipped back down the grid to fifteenth place, almost two seconds slower than James Hunt's pole position time.<ref name="Kyalami 77">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05 ||pages=p. 231-232}}</ref> 

The Welshman's DN8 made a poor start to the Grand Prix and by the end of the first lap was in last place. Pryce started to climb back up the field during the next couple of laps, overtaking [[Brett Lunger]] and team mate Zorzi on lap two, and [[Alex Ribeiro]] and [[Boy Hayje]] the following lap. By lap 18 Pryce had moved from 22nd to 13th place.<ref name="Kyalami 77 Start">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 232-233}}</ref>

[[Image:Kyalami2.JPG|thumb|240px|The area just after ''The Kink'' is where Pryce and Jansen Van Vuuren collided and the ''Crowthorne corner'' where Pryce and [[Jacques Laffite]]'s cars collided.]]

On lap 21, Zorzi pulled off to the left side of the main straight, just after a brow of a hill and a bridge over the track. The Italian was having problems with his fuel metering unit, and fuel was pumping directly onto the engine, which then caught fire. Zorzi did not immediately get out of his car as he was experiencing trouble in disconnecting the oxygen pipe from his helmet.<ref name="Zorzi retirement">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne |title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=232-233}} Oxygen pipes were used to prevent drivers being suffocated if they were trapped in the car in a fire.</ref>

The situation caused two marshals from the pit wall on the opposite side of track to intervene. The first marshal to cross the track was a 25-year old [[panel beater]] called William (Bill). The second was 19-year old Frederick Jansen Van Vuuren, commonly known as Jansen Van Vuuren, who was carrying a 40&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] [[fire extinguisher]].<ref name="Zorzi retirement" /> George Witt, the chief pit marshal for the race, said that the policy of the circuit was that in circumstances involving fires, two marshals must attend and a further two act as back-up in case their extinguishers were not effective enough. Witt also recalled that both Bill and Van Vuuren crossed the track without prior permission.<ref name="George Witt comments">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen. |accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 239}}</ref> The former made it safely across the track, the latter did not. As the two young men started to run across the track, four cars driven by [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]], Pryce, [[Jacques Laffite]] and [[Gunnar Nilsson]] were exiting the final corner and coming onto the main straight.

{{quotebox|"As we got to the top I suddenly sensed this marshal running across the track from my right, carrying an extinguisher. I took a big chance and I don't know how I got away with it. There was no time, I just reacted on pure instinct."|[[Hans-Joachim Stuck]]<ref name="Death 2" />}}

Pryce was directly behind Stuck's car along the main straight, Stuck himself sensed Van Vuuren and moved to the right to avoid both marshals, missing Bill by what Tremayne reports to have been a matter of "millimetres". From his position behind Stuck, Pryce could not see Van Vuuren and was unable to react as fast as Stuck. He struck the teenage marshal at approximately 170&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]]. Van Vuuren was thrown into the air and landed yards in front of Zorzi and Bill.<ref name="Death 1">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05 |pages=234}}</ref> The fire extinguisher smashed into Pryce's head, before striking the Shadow's roll hoop, which threw it over the adjacent grandstand. It came to earth in the car park to the rear of the stand, where it hit a parked car and jammed its door shut.<ref name="Death 2">{{cite book |last=Tremayne |first= David|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|pages=p. 235}}</ref>

The impact with the extinguisher had wrenched Pryce's helmet upward, and he had been partially decapitated by the strap. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now without a driver or a roll hoop, continued down the main straight towards the first corner, ''Crowthorne'', coasting slowly. The Shadow left the track towards the right, scraping the metal barriers before veering back onto the track after hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles. The Shadow then hit Laffite's [[Ligier]] putting the latter out of the race. As for Van Vuuren, the injuries to his body were so severe that he was identified only by exclusion after the race director summoned all of the race marshals and Van Vuuren could not be found.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historicracing.com/top100.cfm?driverID=1077 | title=Historic Racing > Tom Pryce | accessdate=2006-11-23 |publisher=HistoricRacing.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070305172128/http://www.historicracing.com/top100.cfm?driverID=1077 |archivedate=2006-04-24 |quote= }}</ref>

The eventual race winner was [[Austria]]n Niki Lauda, his first win since his near fatal accident during the [[1976 German Grand Prix]]. He later announced it was the greatest victory of his career, but was told on the podium of Pryce's death and said that "there was no joy after that".<ref name="Lauda comment">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 239}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
Pryce's death was met with grief from all those who knew him during his career, none more so than his wife Nella, his parents Jack and Gwyneth and the Shadow team. Pryce's body was buried at St Bartholomew's Church in [[Otford]], near [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSsr=121&GSvcid=4821&GRid=12907252& |title=Find a Grave > Tom Pryce |accessdate=2006-11-21 |date=2006-01-26 |publisher=FindaGrave.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070305172822/http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=12907252 |archivedate=2006-06-01 |quote= }}</ref> the same church where he and Nella were married two years earlier.

Pryce's performances in a Formula One car had earned him a lot of respect among the F1 paddock. Most notable was David Tremayne, who named his son after the Welshman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carkeys.co.uk/features/books/11708.asp |title=The Lost Generation" book review > Tom Pryce | accessdate=2006-11-06 |last=Finlay |first=David |date=2006-10-23 |work= |publisher=CarKeys.co.uk |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> An award was also instigated in Pryce's name, the ''Tom Pryce Award'' also known as the ''Tom Pryce Trophy'', given annually to a Welsh racing driver deemed the most promising in terms of potential.<ref name="Tom Pryce award">{{cite book |last=Tremayne|authorlink=David Tremayne|title=Lost Gen.|accessdate=2007-01-05|pages=p. 255}}</ref>

In [[January]] [[2007]], the Ruthin Town Council expressed an interest in erecting a statue of Tom Pryce in the Vale of [[Clwyd]], to mark the 30th anniversary of his death, and have asked the general public for suggestions.<ref name="Pryce Statue">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/6251329.stm |title=Memorial for racing driver Pryce |accessdate=2007-01-22 |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-01-17 }}</ref> The redeveloped [[Anglesey Circuit|Anglesey Race Circuit]] has named part of the track "The Tom Pryce Straight" after him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angleseycircuit.com/news.html |title=Angelsey Circuit - News |accessdate=2007-03-07|year=2007|publisher=Angelsey Circuit }}</ref>
