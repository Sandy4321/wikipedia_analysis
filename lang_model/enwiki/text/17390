'''D. Iacobescu''' or '''Dumitru Iacobescu''' ({{IPA-ro|du<U+02C8>mitru jako<U+02C8>besku}}; born '''Armand Iacobsohn''';<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.709 (full birth name in index, p.1042)</ref> 1893 <U+2013> October 9, 1913) was a [[Romania]]n [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet. His literary activity only lasted about two years, between his high school graduation and his death from [[tuberculosis]], but made him a critically acclaimed presence inside [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's Symbolist movement]]. Much of Iacobescu's work remained unpublished during his lifetime, and survived as autographed notebooks. Once rediscovered and published some twenty years after his death, it brought him posthumous recognition as a writer of talent, but one whose introversion and nostalgia ran contrary to the main currents in [[Modernist literature|modernism]].

Romanticizing his own physical suffering while adopting stylistic elements from [[France|French]] Symbolist classics such as [[Paul Verlaine]], D. Iacobescu left [[lyric poetry]] that is either resigned or visionary in dealing with mortality. His other contributions display an interest in [[Decadent movement|Decadent]], pre-modernist, themes, as well as a taste for [[black comedy]]. The contrast between his approach and that of other, more [[avant-garde]], Romanian Symbolists did not prevent Iacobescu's affiliation with the modernist circle at [[Ion Minulescu]]'s ''Insula'' magazine.

==Biography==
Born in [[Craiova]] as the son of physician Iacobsohn and his wife Doroteea,<ref name="gc709">C<U+0103>linescu, p.709</ref> the future D. Iacobescu belonged to the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish-Romanian]] community, being one of several Jewish members of his early modernist generation to make an impact on [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]].<ref>{{ro icon}} Boris Marian, [http://www.romlit.ro/un_secol_de_modernism "Un secol de modernism"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 47/2007</ref> 

D. Iacobescu had a short life, marked by his losing battle with tuberculosis.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.709, 710; Vianu, p.87, 90-91</ref> He was however active on the literary scene of [[Bucharest]], just shortly after completing his high school studies.<ref name="tv87">Vianu, p.87</ref> In spring 1912, Iacobescu became an affiliate of the literary circle formed by Minulescu around the short-lived review ''Insula'' (the existence of which marked a coming of age in Romanian Symbolism).<ref>Cernat, p.26-27, 65</ref> At the time, Iacobescu met the modernist poet [[Ion Vinea]], who later contributed his obituary in ''[[Facla]]'' magazine. According to this text, Iacobescu, who rallied with "the purifying and insect repelling" ''Insula'', represented a "multicolored ray, vibrating far away from [...] the mediocre talents."<ref name="pc65">Cernat, p.65</ref> In addition to lending his contribution to ''Insula'', Iacobescu had his various poems published published by several other literary magazines or newspapers: ''[[Flac<U+0103>ra]]'', ''[[Noua Revist<U+0103> Rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103>]]'', ''[[Ramuri]]'', ''Ilustra<U+0163>ia Na<U+0163>ional<U+0103>'', ''Arta'', ''Biruin<U+0163>a''<ref>Vianu, p.86</ref> and ''Noi Pagini Literare''.<ref>Cazimir, p.87; Vianu, p.86-87</ref>

D. Iacobescu died in Bucharest at age nineteen.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.709. Age specified in Vianu, p.87</ref> He left behind several calligraphed manuscripts of his lifelong poetry (most of it previously unpublished), including a notebook carrying the title ''Quasi''. In a [[memoir]] written during or shortly after [[World War I]], literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]], who noted having "read and admired" Iacobescu while he was still alive, reviewed these unpublished pieces, and argued that their title probably alluded to an "indecisive atmosphere" to be discerned in Iacobescu's creative process.<ref name="tv86-87">Vianu, p.86-87</ref> The notebooks included Iacobescu's first mention of being bedridden, with ''Zile de var<U+0103>'' ("Summer Days", dated August 6, 1913), as well as his last known work in verse, ''Capriccio-Fantazie'' (August 13).<ref name="tv89-90">Vianu, p.89-90</ref>

==Work==
===Generic traits===
D. Iacobescu's short career, overlapping with Symbolist mutations into the [[avant-garde]], was still characterized by a focus on the mainstays of Symbolist aesthetics. In his obituary piece, Ion Vinea described the "dreamer's verse" contributed by Iacobescu as complimenting "the fastidious and strange plangency" of Minulescu's work.<ref name="pc65"/> Writing in 1929, the modernist critic and poet [[Benjamin Fondane]] assessed that Minulescu himself was not a Symbolist, but rather one who adopted the label as "the pretext of revolt", and that Iacobescu, [[<U+015E>tefan Petic<U+0103>]], and ("to a lesser degree") Vinea or [[Adrian Maniu]], were the actual voices of Romania's Symbolist school.<ref>[[Benjamin Fondane]], "Paysages", in Jean-Claude Polet, ''Patrimoine litt<U+00E9>raire europ<U+00E9>en. Auteurs europ<U+00E9>ens du premier XXe si<U+00E8>cle, 2: C<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>monial pour la mort du sphynx. 1940-1958: Anthologie en langue fran<U+00E7>aise'', De Boeck Universit<U+00E9>, Brussels, 2002, p.276.  ISBN 2-8041-33932-8</ref> In Tudor Vianu's opinion, Iacobescu was primarily a pre-modernist and "minor poet of great talent", whose work evidenced a stage in Romanian poetry that preceded the [[Romania during World War I|wartime effort]].<ref name="tv89-90"/> Himself a war veteran, Vianu noted: "This poet never once smiled. Wrapped up in his singularity, he was cultivating his nostalgia. This is how people wrote before the war. [...] Our souls demand basic touches and of the most generally human category. Had he been alive, Iacobescu, a less virile talent, could not have resisted."<ref name="tv89">Vianu, p.89</ref>  

A particular trait of Iacobescu's poetry, which placed him in line with the stylistic choices of many Romanian Symbolists, was its use of color-related [[epithet]]s, particularly "[[Synesthesia|synesthesic]]" ones (and, according to researcher Carmen Niculescu, with a personal palette of black, gray and blood red).<ref>{{ro icon}} Carmen Nicolescu, [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=2007_tom1 "Ocuren<U+0163>e ale epitetului sinestezic <U+00EE>n lirica simbolist<U+0103> rom<U+00E2>neasc<U+0103>"], in the [[1 Decembrie 1918 University, Alba Iulia|December 1 University of Alba Iulia]]'s [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=philologica ''Philologica Yearbook''], 2007 (Vol. I), p.136, 140</ref> Tudor Vianu argued that, in his more humorous works in particular, Iacobescu displays "the ''extraordinary'' precision of detail [Vianu's italics]", condensed into "dynamic evocations".<ref name="tv89"/> 

As noted by critics, Iacobescu's poetry was indebted to models in [[Literature of France|French]] or [[Francophone literature]]. A special influence on Iacobescu's style was [[France]]'s Symbolist forerunner [[Paul Verlaine]]<U+2014>according to literary historian [[Paul Cernat]], the Romanian writer was a "Verlainian poet".<ref name="pc65"/> The various echoes from "French poets active after 1885", as found in Iacobescu's style, were attributed by Vianu to three distinct sources: "through their unrealness and bizarreness some of them display, [Iacobescu's poems] border on [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]'s, and through their melodiousness and sweet sentimentality, place themselves beneath the autumnal skies of Verlaine and [[Albert Samain|Samain]]."<ref name="tv87"/>

The overall impact of such borrowings was assessed by literary historians [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] and Tudor Vianu alike. While noting that Iacobescu found in French Symbolism "images suited to his own nostalgia, ships, ports, arctic seas, [[gull]]s, parks, fountains", C<U+0103>linescu suggests that the parallel imagery of ''[[F<U+00EA>te galante|f<U+00EA>tes galantes]]'' is excessive: "[[Pierrot]]s, [[Columbina]]s, lords, misses, [[minuet]]s, [[gavotte]]s, pianos, [[mandolin]]s, guitars, pinkish, purple, gray salons, all in a too specifically French atmosphere, pushed to the point where it evokes the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]".<ref name="gc709"/> Expanding on his view about Iacobescu's poetry being essentially [[Decadent movement|Decadent]], Vianu exclaimed: "Bourbons! Lilies! Chinaware! Silk! Our soul<U+2014>I'm being told by something that comes from deep within<U+2014>demands different realities nowadays. Iacobescu took to his grave a something from his age."<ref>Vianu, p.90</ref>

===Poems about disease and death===
C<U+0103>linescu believes the "personal note" of Iacobescu's literary contribution is to be found in [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] which deal with his sickness, with solitude and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], detailing states such as "the strain of hearing to the vibrations of silence" or "the sensitivity in relation to rain".<ref name="gc710">C<U+0103>linescu, p.710</ref> One such sample reads:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top" 
|
<poem>
Mi-aduc aminte ca acuma
Cum noi st<U+0103>team ursuzi la geam
Ca dou<U+0103> bufni<U+0163>e pe-un ram
<U+015E>i a<U+015F>teptam s<U+0103> treac<U+0103> ploaia...<ref name="gc710"/>
</poem>
|
<poem>
I remember as if it were now
How we were sitting sullen by the window
Like two owls on some branch
And waited for the rain to pass...
</poem>
|
|}

Several such poems deal more or less explicitly with the symptoms of Iacobescu's disease. In one piece, titled ''Poem de amiaz<U+0103>'' ("Noon Poem"), the author talks about his episodes of [[hemoptysis]] (or, according to C<U+0103>linescu, "the obsession of hemorrhages").<ref name="gc710"/> It reads:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top" 
|
<poem>
Nici eu nu <U+015F>tiu ce am!...
Hemoragii de soare-mi bat <U+00EE>n geam,
Cu lenevii de aur cald m<U+0103> fur<U+0103>
<U+015E>i m<U+0103> s<U+0103>rut<U+0103> lung, pe ochi, pe gur<U+0103>...<ref name="gc710"/>
</poem>
|
<poem>
I too don't know what it is I have!...
Sunlit hemorrhages are knocking on my window,
Steal me away with idlenesses of warm gold
And kiss me long, on my eyes, on my mouth...
</poem>
|
|}

In the end, C<U+0103>linescu notes, Iacobescu displayed the "fixation of death, which he sees as a descent into an aquatic environment".<ref name="gc710"/> This is in reference to stanzas where Iacobescu talks about a [[Vision (spirituality)|spiritual vision]] or an [[Ghost|apparition]]:
{| width="100%"

<poem>
And the cold bodies that we think are sleeping
In the depths of rivers, of seas and of oceans,
And the cold bodies that we think are sleeping
Lead their new lives in an enormous land
Of plants and [[coral]]s.

And their life is calm, soft and cool
For they have empty vases where their hearts once were;
They always gather together in the wet parks,
And, veiled by an eternal rosy sunset,
Speak softly of the world, of friends and family.
</poem>

According to Vianu, Iacobescu's ''Quasi'' poems are in large part determined by the "premonition of death", showing his struggle with the notion and his coming to terms with it.<ref name="tv90-91">Vianu, p.90-91</ref> In the end, the same critic argues, Iacobescu turned to "the illusion of historical [[Fatalism|fatality]]" in order to explain his condition.<ref name="tv90-91"/> He finds proof of this in Iacobescu's lines:
{| width="100%"
|- valign="top" 
|
<poem>
O, adormi, adormi
<U+00CE>n calmul nesf<U+00E2>r<U+015F>itelor pustii,
Troienit de valuri largi de soare,
De {{not a typo|imense}} lini<U+015F>ti arz<U+0103>toare,
De nisipuri sterpe <U+015F>i latente
<U+015E>i de-un <U+015F>ir de veacuri decadente.<ref>Vianu, p.91</ref>
</poem>
|
<poem>
O, fall asleep, fall asleep
To the calmness of infinite wastelands,
Covered by vast waves of sunlight,
By immense and burning silences,
By barren and latent sands,
And by an endless string of decadent ages.
</poem>
|
|}

===Black comedy===
Iacobescu's sad and meditative poetry was contrasted by his other works, where he turns to depicting the irony of life, often highlighted by his use of [[grotesque]] imagery. Focusing on the Symbolist contribution to [[Romanian humor]], literary historian [[<U+015E>tefan Cazimir]] argues that, among Iacobescu's writings, such samples echo either Verlaine (in cases where Iacobescu discusses his "hypothetical love affairs" in self-mocking tones) or [[Jules Laforgue]] (in those pieces where his texts veer into [[black comedy]]).<ref>Cazimir, p.XXII-XXIII</ref> Cazimir suggests that the latter influence is to be found in the poem ''Prin cea<U+0163><U+0103>'' ("Through the Fog"), where Iacobescu likens streetlights to ghosts that have no choice but to play audience to tomcats in heat.<ref>Cazimir, p.XXIII</ref>

In his 1918 note on Iacobescu, Vianu also assessed: "I do believe I have managed to capture an especially original tone in his poetry [...]. I mean a certain ''sentimental grotesque'' [Italics in the original] where laughter merges into a flinch of pain."<ref name="tv88">Vianu, p.88</ref> This trait, Vianu notes, is especially observable in settings such as ''Scen<U+0103> de sear<U+0103>'' ("Evening Scene"), where patients in a [[mental institution]] marvel as one of them plays the ballerina, and where contentment suddenly becomes violence:
{| width="100%"

<poem>
Iar unul dintre d<U+00E2>n<U+015F>ii plec<U+00E2>ndu-se <U+00EE>i str<U+00E2>nge
Un mic buchet de iarb<U+0103> <U+015F>i de m<U+0103>ce<U+015F> uscat,
Cum, <U+00EE>ns<U+0103>, dansatorul refuz<U+0103> <U+00EE>ncurcat,
Galantul se repede <U+015F>i-l bate p<U+00E2>n' la s<U+00E2>nge.<ref name="tv88"/>
</poem>
|
<poem>
And one of them leans down to pick for him
A tiny wisp of grass and dried-up [[Rosa rubiginosa|eglantine]],
But, since the dancer uneasily refuses,
The gentleman pummels him until blood gushes out.   
</poem>
|
|}

==Legacy==
The poet's notebooks were preserved by his friends, but, according to Vianu, they were unable to persuade publishers to issue them as a volume.<ref name="tv86-87"/> ''Quasi'' was eventually published in 1930.<ref>Cazimir, p.88</ref> After being reviewed by Vinea and Vianu, Iacobescu's work was revisited by critics of the [[interwar period]], including C<U+0103>linescu and the modernist critic [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Ionesco]]. The latter's articles, which center on the idea of radical cultural innovation, attacked the substance of Iacobescu's poems in terms deemed "full of hate" by cultural historian [[Marta Petreu]].<ref>Mara Magda Maftei, [http://icfi.ulim.md/ro/publicatii/files/francopolifonia_2010.pdf "Emil Cioran and Eugen Ionescu, Two Different Ideologues of the Same Generation"], in the [[Free International University of Moldova]]'s ''Francopolyphonie Yearbook'', 2010, p.185</ref> 

Iacobescu's work was again the object of critical interest in and after 2008, when semiologist and critic [[Marin Mincu]] published the [[anthology]] ''Poezia rom<U+00E2>n<U+0103> actual<U+0103>'' ("Timely Romanian Poetry"). In what was equated with an actual recovery by literary reviewer [[Bogdan Cre<U+0163>u]],<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Bogdan Cre<U+0163>u]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Istoria-interna-a-poeticitatii-romanesti*articleID_19467-articles_details.html "Istoria intern<U+0103> a poeticit<U+0103><U+0163>ii rom<U+00E2>ne<U+015F>ti"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 416, March 2008</ref> it placed Iacobescu alongside other representatives of lyrical Romanian Symbolism. Mincu's work also placed Iacobescu's taste for the [[ballade]] poetic form in relation to the balladesque poetry of the 1940s, in particular with that produced by the modernist [[Sibiu Literary Circle]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr-4-2008-4379.html "Sinteza critic<U+0103> a lui Marin Mincu"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 938, February 2008</ref>
