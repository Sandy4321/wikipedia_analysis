'''Vacuum energy''' is an underlying background [[energy]] that exists in [[space]] even when devoid of [[matter]].

The vacuum energy results in existence of most (if not all) [[fundamental forces]]  - and thus in all effects involving these forces too - and is observed in various experiments (like [[spontaneous emission]] of light or gamma radiation, [[Casimir effect]], [[Van der Waals force|Van-Der Waals bonds]], [[Lamb shift]], etc) and it is thought (but not yet demonstrated) to have consequences for the behavior of the [[Universe]] on [[Physical cosmology|cosmological scales]].

==Vacuum energy in theories of elementary particles==

[[Quantum field theory]], which describes the [[interaction]]s between [[elementary particles]] in terms of [[Field (physics)|field]]s, allows a contribution to the vacuum energy (even when no particles are present) in a form of the [[zero-point energy]] of the [[Field (physics)|field]]s.

An example is the [[Casimir effect]], where two metal plates experience a small attractive [[force]] between them, which can be attributed to the dependence of the [[zero-point energy]] of the [[electromagnetic field]] on the distance between the plates.

Since [[potential energy]] is defined up to an arbitrary [[constant]], the absolute value of the vacuum energy might seem to be unimportant, however it becomes important when [[gravity]] is involved, since [[gravity]] [[Coupling (physics)|couples]] to the total energy of the system. This has important consequences on [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] scales, where the vacuum energy is expected to contribute to the [[cosmological constant]], which affects the [[expansion of the universe]].

The calculation of the vacuum energy in [[quantum field theory]] in terms of [[Feynman diagrams]] can be pictured as accounting for [[virtual particles]] (also known as ''vacuum fluctuations'') which are created and destroyed out of the [[vacuum]].

Additional contributions to the vacuum energy come from [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] in [[quantum field theory]].

==Implications==
{{Mergeto|zero-point energy|date=October 2006}}
Vacuum energy has a number of consequences. For one, vacuum fluctuations are always created as particle/antiparticle pairs. The creation of these "[[virtual particle]]s" near the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]] has been hypothesized by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] to be a mechanism for the eventual [[Hawking radiation|"evaporation" of black holes]]. The net energy of the universe remains zero so long as the particle pairs annihilate each other within [[Planck time]]. If one of the pair is pulled into the black hole before this, then the other particle becomes "real" and energy/mass is essentially radiated into space from the black hole. This loss is cumulative and could result in the black hole's disappearance over time. The time required is dependent on the mass of the black hole, but could be on the order of [[Googol|10<sup>100</sup>]] years for large solar-mass black holes.

The [[Grand unification theory]] predicts a non-zero cosmological constant from the energy of vacuum fluctuations. Examining normal [[physics|physical]] [[process]]es with knowledge of these field [[phenomena]] can lead to an interesting insight in [[electrodynamics]]. During discussions of [[perpetual motion]], the topic of vacuum energy usually encourages serious inquiries.

==History==

In [[1934]], [[Georges Lema<U+00EE>tre]] used an unusual [[ideal gas|perfect-fluid]] [[equation of state]] to interpret the cosmological constant as due to vacuum energy. In [[1973]], [[Edward Tryon]] proposed that the Universe may be a large scale quantum mechanical vacuum fluctuation where positive [[mass]]-energy is balanced by negative gravitational [[potential energy]]. During the [[1980s]], there were many attempts to relate the fields that generate the vacuum energy to specific fields that were predicted by the [[Grand unification theory]], and to use observations of the Universe to confirm that theory. These efforts have failed so far, and the exact nature of the particles or fields that generate vacuum energy, with a density such as that required by the Inflation theory, remains a mystery.
