It is the fourth largest [[municipal corporation]] in Tamil Nadu and also the fourth largest [[urban agglomeration]] in the state. Situated at a distance of {{Convert|325|km}} south of [[Chennai]] and {{Convert|402|km}} north of [[Kanyakumari]] on the [[National Highway (India)|National Highway]] NH 45, it is located almost at the geographic centre of the state. 

Tiruchirappalli is believed to have been named after the three-headed demon [[Trishira]] of Hindu mythology who is believed to have indulged in penance and obtained favours at this place. The city is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled by the [[Early Cholas]], Early Pandyas, [[Pallavas]], [[Medieval Cholas]], [[Later Cholas]], Later Pandyas, [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Ma'bar Sultanate]], [[Vijayanagar Empire]], [[Nayak Dynasty]], the [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic state]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] at different times. The archaeologically important town of [[Uraiyur]] which served as the capital of the Early Cholas is a suburb of Tiruchirappalli. Tiruchirappalli has a number of historical monuments, the ''[[Rockfort]]'', [[Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple|Ranganathaswamy temple at Srirangam]] and the [[Jambukeswarar Temple, Thiruvanaikaval|Jambukeswarar temple at Thiruvanaikaval]] being the most prominent among them.

Tiruchirappalli is an important industrial and educational hub of central Tamil Nadu. The factories of [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]] (BHEL), [[Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project]] and [[Golden Rock Locomotive Workshops|Golden Rock Railway Workshops]] are located in Tiruchirappalli. The [[National Institutes of Technology]] (NIT), [[Bharathidasan University]], [[Bharathidasan Institute of Management]] and [[Anna University of Technology, Tiruchirappalli|Anna University of Technology]] have their campuses in the city.

==Etymology==
The name Tiruchirappalli is believed by some to have been derived from the Sanskrit "Trishirapuram" - 'Trishira' meaning "three-headed" and 'palli' or 'puram' meaning "City".<ref name="hemingwayp2">[[#Hemingway|Hemingway]], p 2</ref><ref name="frommersindiap350">{{cite book|title=Frommer's India|page=350|first1=Pippa|last1=de Bruyn|first2=Keith|last2=Bain|first3=David|last3=Allardice|id=ISBN 0-470-55610-2, ISBN 978-0-470-55610-8|publisher=Frommer's|year=2010}}</ref><ref name="hobsonjobson">{{cite book|title=Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases|chapter=Trichinopoly|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:368.hobson|publisher=J.

Other derivations of Tiruchirappalli have been provided by the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] scholar [[C. P. Brown]] who suggested that Tiruchirappalli might be a derivative of the word 'Chiruta-palli' meaning "little town".<ref name="hemingwayp2" /><ref name="hobsonjobson" /> In an inscription of the sixteenth century, Tiruchirappalli is mentioned as ''Tiru-ssila-palli'' meaning "holy-rock-town" in Tamil and [[Henry Yule]] and [[Arthur Coke Burnell]] believed that the name Tiruchirappalli might have been derived from it.<ref name="hemingwayp2" /><ref name="hobsonjobson" /> A few other scholars feel that the name Tiruchirappalli might have been derived from Tiru-chinna-palli meaning "holy little town".<ref name="hemingwayp2" /><ref name="hobsonjobson" /> Some even feel that Tiruchirappali might have been named after a [[Jain]] monk named "Chira".<ref name="suraguidep89">[[#Sura Guide|Sura Guide]], p 89</ref> The ''Madras Glossary'' gives the root as ''Tiru<U+0107><U+0107>in<U+0101>ppalli'' or the "holy (''tiru'') village (''palli'') of the ''shina'' (''[[Cissampelos pareira]]'') plant".<ref name="hobsonjobson" />

During British rule, Tiruchirappalli was commonly referred to using the erroneous spelling "Trichinopoly".<ref name="fallinggrain">{{cite web|title=Tiruchirappalli|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/25/Tiruchchirappalli.html|publisher=Falling Grain genomics Inc.|accessdate=2011-05-12}}</ref> The shortened forms "Trichy"<ref name="frommersindiap350" /><ref name="lonelyplanetp1073">[[#Bindloss and Singh|Bindloss and Singh]], pp 1073</ref><ref name="indiap720">{{cite book|title=India - A Travel Guide|page=720|first1=Dr. B.R.|last1=Kishore|first2=Dr. Shiv|last2=Sharma|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|id=ISBN 81-284-0067-3, ISBN 978-81-284-0067-4}}</ref> or "Tiruchi"<ref name="indiap720" /> are more frequently used in common parlance.
