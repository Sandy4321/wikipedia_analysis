'''''Second City Television''''', or '''''SCTV''''', was a [[Canada|Canadian]] television [[sketch comedy]] show offshoot from the Toronto troupe of [[The Second City]]. It ran from [[1976]] to [[1984]].

==Performers==
The show's original cast included:
* [[John Candy]] (1976 <U+2013> 79, 1981 <U+2013> 83)
* [[Joe Flaherty]] (1976 <U+2013> 84)
* [[Eugene Levy]] (1976 <U+2013> 84)
* [[Andrea Martin]] (1976 <U+2013> 84)
* [[Catherine O'Hara]] (1976 <U+2013> 79, 1981 <U+2013> 82)
* [[Harold Ramis]] (1976 <U+2013> 78)
* [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (1976 <U+2013> 82)

Many of them had previously been regulars on ''[[The David Steinberg Show]]''. All of the original featured cast went on to successful careers in American film and television. [[Rick Moranis]] (1980 <U+2013> 82), [[Tony Rosato]] (1980 <U+2013> 81) and [[Robin Duke]] (1980 <U+2013> 81) joined the cast for Season 3 to replace Candy and O'Hara. Rosato and Duke were called upon by [[Dick Ebersol]] to help fix ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the spring of 1981, while Candy and O'Hara returned for ''SCTV'''s network debut on [[NBC]]. [[Martin Short]] (1982 <U+2013> 84) joined the cast at the tail-end of Season 4 to replace Thomas and Moranis, while John Hemphill and [[Mary Charlotte Wilcox]] (now an [[Anglican]] priest in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]), though never full cast members, appeared semi-regularly through Seasons 5 and 6.

==History==
''SCTV'' first aired as a half-hour show on [[Global Television Network|Global]] in Canada, starting in [[1976]], for two seasons. In [[1980]], after a one year hiatus, the show moved to the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] for its third season. The first three seasons also aired in [[television syndication|syndication]] in the [[United States]] starting in [[1977]]. In [[1981]], it was picked up as a 90 minute show by NBC as a mid-season replacement (for ''[[The Midnight Special (television)|The Midnight Special]]''), airing first as ''SCTV Network 90'', then as ''SCTV''. During its network run, the show garnered 15 [[Emmy]] nominations, winning two (both for outstanding writing in a variety or music program). The show continued to air on the CBC in Canada as a full hour, compiled from the NBC shows. In the fall of [[1983]], for its final season, the show moved to pay-TV channels [[Movie Central|Superchannel]] in Canada and [[Cinemax]] in the [[United States]], changing the name slightly to ''SCTV Channel''.

==Premise==
The basic premise of ''SCTV'' is that it is the television station for the city of Melonville. Rather than broadcast the usual TV rerun fare, the business, run by the greedy [[Guy Caballero]] (Joe Flaherty) who sits in a wheelchair only to gain "respect" and leverage in business and staff negotiations, puts on a bizarre and humorously incompetent range of cheap local programming. This can range from a [[soap opera]] called "The Days of the Week", to game shows like "Shoot the Stars", in which celebrities are literally shot at like targets in a shooting gallery, to full blown movie spoofs like "Play it Again, Bob" in which [[Woody Allen]] (Moranis) tries to get [[Bob Hope]] (Thomas) to star in his next film. In-house media melodrama was also satirised with characters like Candy's vain, bloated variety star Johnny La Rue, Thomas' acerbic critic Bill Needle and Martin's flamboyant, leopard-skin clad station manager Mrs. Edith Prickley.

See also ''[[UHF (movie)|UHF]]'', a movie which used a similar premise to ''SCTV'', but without the sketch comedy.

==Laugh Track==
One other point of contention between ''SCTV'' and several different networks they were on was the use of [[laugh track]]s. As ''SCTV'' wasn't a live show, it paced its comedy accordingly, and several pieces were more outr<U+00E9> than standard network fare. The use of a laugh track often stepped clumsily on the punchlines as a result, and there are some reports that the laugh track editor admitted to not getting ''SCTV'''s humor and just threw laughs in wherever they would fit{{citeneeded}}.

The laugh track used in early episodes was actually recorded using audience reactions during live performances in the Second City theater.

==Syndication/Music Rights==
For years, ''SCTV'' was unavailable on video tape or in any form except by reedited half hour programs. This is because the producers and editors putting the original shows together never bothered to get clearance to use copyrighted music <U+2014> for example, the "Fishin' Musician" show ended with [[Bing Crosby]] singing "[[Gone Fishin' (song)|Gone Fishin']]", even though ''SCTV'' never got the rights to use the music or performance. As a result, the shows couldn't be reproduced on DVD or video tape until after the laborious rights issues were resolved and clearances were received. In some cases (as with the aforementioned Crosby song) clearances couldn't be secured after the fact and new music had to be edited in its place for the [[2005]] DVD releases of the 90-minute shows. In a few cases where the music is intrinsic to the premise of the sketch (such as the sketches "Stairways to Heaven" and "The Canadian National Anthem") and rights could not be obtained, sketches have been dropped from the DVDs.

==Significance==
''SCTV'' initially adapted its comedy from existing sketches and improvisation from the [[Second City]] stage show. However, especially after expanding to a ninety minute format, ''SCTV'' quickly pushed the envelope on television sketch comedy. While showing some influence from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and ''Saturday Night Live'', ''SCTV'' eschewed either the live television format or even filming before a live studio audience. As a result, far more attention and care could be taken in building a premise and supporting it.

Having a moderately low budget and limited resources (the most fertile years of the show's production occurred in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], which saved on money but lacked a lot of the resources available in larger cities or more traditional production venues), ''SCTV'' got a reputation for making the most out of what it had, reusing sets and particularly taking advantage of makeup and prosthetic devices in the creation of characters. With the luxury of being able to take long periods of time in the makeup chair, elaborate characters could be built. Cast members credited their makeup artists as having helped create their characters, referring to the process in interviews as "improvisation in the chair."

To add to the feel of the show <U+2014> which after all was supposed to be a low budget local television station that went national <U+2014> the ''SCTV'' crew recruited their dance troupe from the writers on the show, led by costumer [[Juul Haalmeyer]]. The "Juul Haalmeyer Dancers" were spectacularly maladroit, parodying dance teams on variety shows through their sheer ineptness, and ultimately attracting a cult fandom of their own. (Juul Haalmeyer himself reports still being asked for autographs years later.)

The core premise of the show allowed for tremendous variety in presentation, but unlike Monty Python, which often would cut from one sketch to another without any resolution, the ''SCTV'' format required television style bridges. One technique they used was to build premises into "promos" for shows that would never run (such as "Melvin and Howards," a parody of the movie ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'' which featured [[Melvin Dummar]], [[Howard Hughes]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Curly Howard]] and Senator [[Howard Baker]] on a road trip singing old tunes). Another was to take longer pieces that failed and cut them into promos or trailers. However, the internal logic of the series <U+2014> that this actually was a television station producing low budget programming <U+2014> was never lost. ''SCTV'''s techniques helped inform and influence later shows, with clear influence on ''[[The State (TV series)|The State]]'', the ''[[Upright Citizen's Brigade]]'', and ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]''.

Later shows built a tight theme, sometimes acting as a metaparody <U+2014> as in the Emmy-winning "Moral Majority" episode where advertisers and special interest groups forced significant changes to ''SCTV''<U+2019>s programming, "Zontar" (a parody of the [[John Agar]] film ''[[Zontar, Thing from Venus]]'') which featured an alien race seeking to kidnap ''SCTV''<U+2019>s on air talent for "a nine show cycle plus three best-ofs" (which was the actual deal NBC worked out with ''SCTV'' that season), and an ambitious parody of ''[[The Godfather]]'' featuring an all out network war over [[pay television]] between ''SCTV'', [[CBS]], NBC, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[PBS]]. (The last featured [[mafia]] style [[Gangland killing|hits]] on the sets of ''[[The Today Show]]'', ''[[Three's Company]]'' and ''[[The NFL Today]]'', as well as an extended sequence with guest star [[John Marley]] reprising his Godfather role of Hollywood mogul [[Jack Woltz]].) While these shows continued to incorporate the broad range of television parodies the show was known for, they also had a strong narrative thread which set the show apart from other sketch comedy shows of the time.

The show would also have a huge influence on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. In the DVD commentary for [[Homer vs. The Eighteenth Amendment]] (in which Dave Thomas guest-stars), everyone says how much they loved the show and how influential it was because "it was so funny". [[Matt Groening]] goes on to say that he was specifically inspired by the town of Melonville, its own little universe with many recurring characters, and that that was the type of universe he wanted for ''The Simpsons''. Both Dave Thomas and Andrea Martin have guest-starred on ''The Simpsons''.

The entire troupe was given a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in 2002. Also, [[John Candy]], [[Martin Short]] and [[Eugene Levy]] have individual stars.

==Special guests and musical guests==
With the coming of the NBC years also came a network edict to include musical guests (in part because of their use on ''Saturday Night Live'', which NBC executives considered the model for ''SCTV'', despite their being very different shows). At first, the ''SCTV'' cast, writers and producers resisted special guests, on the theory that famous people wouldn't just "drop into" the Melonville studios. However, they soon discovered that by actually working these guests into different show-within-a-shows, they could keep the premise going while also giving guest stars something more to do than show up and sing a song. As a result, [[Doctor John]] became a featured player in the movie "Polynesiantown," [[John Mellencamp]] (then still known as John Cougar) was Mister Hyde to [[Ed Grimley|Ed Grimley's]] Doctor Jekyll in "The Nutty Lab Assistant," [[Natalie Cole]] was made into a zombie by a cabbage in "Zontar," and the [[Boomtown Rats]] were both blown up on "Farm Film Report" and starred in the ''[[To Sir With Love]]'' parody "Teacher's Pet." It reached a point where [[Hall and Oates]] appeared on a "Sammy Maudlin Show" segment, promoting a new film called "Chariots of Eggs," which was a parody of both ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' and ''[[Personal Best]]'', only to show scenes from the faux movie as clips.

This, along with ''SCTV'''s cult status, led to the show's celebrity fans clamoring to appear. Later on, [[Tony Bennett]] credited his appearance on Bob and Doug McKenzie's variety-show debacle "The Great White North Palace" as triggering a significant career comeback. Sketch comedy giant [[Carol Burnett]] did an ad for the show in which an alarm clock goes off next to her bed, she rises up suddenly and advises those who couldn't stay up late enough (the NBC version aired from 12:30 to 2 a.m.) to go to bed, get some sleep, then wake up to watch the show. Burnett later briefly appeared in a climactic "courtroom" episode of "The Days of the Week".

Former [[SNL]] cast member and current indie-film actor [[Bill Murray]] also guest-starred on a "Days of the Week" installment, as a photography buff scrambling to make it to the wedding of singer-songwriter Clay Collins ([[Rick Moranis]]) and town slut Sue-Ellen Allison ([[Catherine O'Hara]]) in time to take pictures of the event.

==Features==
Parody shows included ''Natalie Wingneck'', a ''[[Tarzan]]''-style spoof in which Martin played a girl raised by geese after her family died in a [[plane crash]]. A parody of the popular [[Western (genre)|western]] [[drama]] ''[[Grizzly Adams]]'' <U+2014> retitled ''Grizzly Abrams'' <U+2014> depicted the burly wilderness hero as the owner of a wild [[tortoise]] which took weeks to lead [[police]] to the [[skeletal]] remains of its master, trapped beneath a fallen [[logging|log]].

The TV station concept provided ''[[SCTV]]'' the ability to lampoon virtually any television genre, as well as [[commercials]], promos, [[network]] IDs, and more. Some of the most memorable sketches involved parodies of low-budget late-night ads, like ''Al Peck's Used Fruit'' (they enticed viewers to visit by offering free tickets to ''Circus Lupus'', the Circus of the Wolves; mocked-up photos depicted wolves forming a pyramid and jumping through flaming hoops). Equally memorable were the faux-inept ads for local businesses like ''Phil's Nails'' and ''Tex and Edna Boil's Prairie Warehouse and Curio Emporium''.

'''Impersonations''' were also an integral part of the comedy, with almost every cast member playing multiple roles as well-known personalities. Some impressions included:
* John Candy as [[Orson Welles]], [[Julia Child]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Glen Milstead]] as Divine, [[Curly Howard]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Tip O'Neill]], [[Jimmy the Greek]] and [[Herv<U+00E9> Villechaize]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]].
* Robin Duke as [[Shelley Winters]]
* Joe Flaherty as [[Gregory Peck]], [[Gavin MacLeod]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Peter O'Toole]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[William F. Buckley]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Alan Alda]], [[Gene Siskel]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Jack Klugman]], [[Slim Whitman]], [[Larry Fine]] and [[Salvador Dal<U+00ED>]]
* Eugene Levy as [[Ricardo Montalban]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[The Andy Griffith Show]]'s [[Floyd Lawson]], [[Milton Berle]], [[Neil Sedaka]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Ralph Young]], [[Perry Como]] and [[Gene Shalit]]
* Andrea Martin as [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Linda Lavin]], [[Joyce DeWitt]], [[Indira Gandhi]], [[Connie Francis]], [[Arlene Francis]], [[Ethel Merman]], [[Karen Black]], [[Marsha Mason]], [[Charo]] and [[Mother Teresa]]
* Rick Moranis as [[Merv Griffin]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Dick Cavett]], [[George Carlin]], [[Michael McDonald]], [[Al Waxman]], [[David Brinkley]], [[James Stewart]].

* Martin Short as [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Pierre Trudeau]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[David Steinberg]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Fred Rogers]], Ambassador [[Ken Taylor]], [[Pee Wee Reese]], [[Deliverance]] banjo-boy Hoyt Pollard, [[Jamie Farr]], [[Scott Baio]], Denny Terrio, [[Howie Mandel]], [[Howie Meeker]], Tony Sandler (of Sandler and Young), [[Tom Hayden]], [[Gore Vidal]] and [[Brian Linehan]]
* Dave Thomas as [[Bob Hope]], [[Richard Harris]], [[DeForest Kelly]], [[Liberace]], [[Michael Caine]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Roger Ebert]], [[Neil Simon]], [[Lee Iacocca]], [[Carl Sagan]], [[John Ritter]] and [[Walter Cronkite]]

'''Popular sketches and characters''' include:
* ''Farm Film Report'' aka ''Farm Film Celebrity Blow-Up'': Two [[hick]]s named '''Big Jim McBob''' (Flaherty) and '''Billy Sol Hurok''' ([[Billie Sol Estes]] and [[Sol Hurok]], played by Candy) interviewed celebrities and ultimately encouraged them to "blow up" (creating the [[catch-phrase]] "... blow'd up good, blow'd up real good!"). Exploded guests included [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[David Steinberg]] (both played by Short), [[Bernadette Peters]] (Martin) and [[Neil Sedaka]] (Levy).
* ''The Sammy Maudlin Show'': Joe Flaherty was the afro-coiffed, knee-slapping, overly-effusive host welcoming a panel of "stars" who did nothing but heap lavish praise on each other and applaud their pointless profundities. Originally a parody of [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]'s short-lived gab-fest, ''Maudlin'' (the word means overly sentimental, treacly) evolved into a late-night universe all its own. Eugene Levy is "a comic in all seriousness" as egomaniacal funnyman '''Bobby Bittman''' (younger brother '''Skip Bittman''', played by Moranis, eventually appeared on ''Maudlin'' as well, with disastrous results); Andrea Martin skewered [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[Lorna Luft]] with "real terrific" combo-character '''Lorna Minnelli'''; Catherine O'Hara inhabited pill-popping boozer '''Lola Heatherton''', a [[Joey Heatherton]]-[[Lola Falana]] amalgam who greeted fans with her trademark shriek, ''"I love you! I wanna bear your children!"''; John Candy portrayed constantly-chuckling [[Ed McMahon]]-style [[sidekick]]/[[sycophant]] '''William B. Williams''', who often wound up kneeling on the floor as guests came out and the couch filled up. The ''Maudlin'' regulars would later appear together in the [[Rat Pack]] movie parody ''Maudlin's Eleven''.
* ''Mel's Rock Pile'' was an [[American Bandstand]] knockoff that also closely resembled the [[Citytv]] show ''[[Boogie]]''. This teen dance program was hosted by '''"Rockin' Mel" Slirrup''' (Eugene Levy), a nervous, bespectacled nerd who played lame pop songs for surly in-studio teen guests. One memorable episode of ROCK PILE featured an appearance by ''[[Sex Pistols]]''-type band ''The Queen Haters'', featuring the entire Short-era cast in perfect '80s punk-band mode.
* Martin Short's '''Jackie Rogers Jr''' was an earnestly smarmy [[Las Vegas]] [[headliner]] of [[Albino]] descent afflicted with an accent of indeterminate origin and a grating, lisping laugh. He's partial to sequined jumpsuits, [[Jack Jones]]-style song standards, and "eligible ladies". Later, Rogers would run for political office but drop out of the race when he realizes it's cramping his show-biz [[lifestyle]].
* Insufferable [[talk show]] host '''Catherine Timber''' (O'Hara), star of ''Enough About Me'' (also her [[trademark]] phrase).
* Martin Short's somewhat-unclassifiable uber-nerd '''[[Ed Grimley]]''' (later featured on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' when Short became a regular) was an SCTV fixture, appearing on numerous assorted shows, [[commercials]], promos, and "behind-the-scenes" dramas.
* ''Half-Wits'' and ''High-Q'' were parodies of quiz shows ''[[College Bowl]]'' and ''[[Reach For The Top]]'' hosted by a highly-irritable [[Alex Trebek]] approximation named '''Alex Trebel''' (Levy), a thinly-veiled [[riff]] on the real-life ''[[Jeopardy]]'' host.
* ''The 5 Neat Guys'', an absurdly [[clean-cut]], '50s style [[vocal group]] (<U+00E1> la ''[[The Four Freshmen]]''), were portrayed by Candy, Flaherty (as the [[drunk]] one), Levy, Moranis, and Thomas. The "5" sang songs like ''I've Got a [[Hickey]] on My Shoulder'', ''[[Pimples]] and Pockmarks'' and other "memorable" tunes.
* Another Martin Short character, talk-show host '''Brock Linehan''' was a [[parody]] of real-life [[Canadian]] [[interviewer]], the late '''[[Brian Linehan]]'''. Linehan was famous for his overpreparation, which Short satirized by going in the [[opposite]] direction: on SCTV's version of the Linehan show, called ''Stars in One'', all the research compiled about any particular episode's guest was totally and completely wrong, making for some unhappy guests and one frustrated, uneasy host.
* '''Harry, the Guy with the Snake on his Face''' (John Candy). Harry ran Melonville's [[adult]] book and [[X-rated]] [[video]] stores.
* "Video [[deejay]]" '''Gerry Todd''' (Moranis) hosted a "televised-radio" type of [[video]] show. Moranis' turtleneck-sporting, smooth-talking radio-personality parody was perfectly pitched, and eerily presaged the first group of [[MTV]] [[VJ]]s.
* '''Mayor Tommy Shanks''' (John Candy) was Melonville's "easygoing" ([[corrupt]]) [[mayor]] who was prone to sudden fits of [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] and [[physical violence]], and gave regular [[fireside chats]] on SCTV while his stuffed dog sat motionless by his side. Throwing out one [[non-sequiter]] after another, Shanks managed to discuss absolutely nothing of relevance during his mayoral broadcasts. Eventually, Shanks succumbed to [[mental illness]] and was institutionalized.
* ''SCTV News'' (later ''Nightline Melonville''), anchored by Joe Flaherty as mostly [[professional]] (but [[alcoholic]]) [[newscaster]] '''Floyd Robertson''' and Eugene Levy as [[geeky]], [[clueless]] '''Earl Camembert''', a model of oblivious self-importance. The SCTV news-team was modeled after Canadian [[news anchor]]s [[Lloyd Robertson]] and [[Earl Cameron (Canadian broadcaster)|Earl Cameron]] respectively.
* ''Monster Chiller Horror Theater'': This fright-film showcase featured laughably non-frightening [[z-movie]]s like ''Dr. Tongue's 3-D House of Stewardesses''. Dr. Tongue was played by John Candy and ''Monster Chiller Horror Theater'' was hosted by Flaherty character '''[[Count Floyd]]''', who was revealed in a later episode to be ''SCTV News'' anchorman Floyd Robertson working a second job.
* '''The Shmenge Brothers''' and their [[polka]] band, '''The Happy Wanderers'''. Like [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]], the Shmenges were breakout [[characters]] and their popularity resulted in an [[HBO]] special called ''The Last Polka'' (a parody of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Waltz]]''). (John Candy would go on to play another [[polka]] [[clarinetist]] in [[Home Alone]], which also starred Catherine O'Hara.) On one of their shows, the Shmenges performed a memorable tribute to [[composer]] [[John Williams]].
* Dave Thomas as actor [[Richard Harris (actor)|Richard Harris]] in a skit where "Harris" sang an extended version of his famous hit ''[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]'', then dances endlessly in total agony during the elongated orchestral stretch while the show moves on to other skits. The song finally ends when an audience member hurls a brick at his chest.
* The famous C3P1-[[Russia]]n television episode in which SCTV is taken over by Soviet programming. At first, nothing seems out of the ordinary at the station: on the air, Eugene Levy plays [[Perry Como]] in a promo for ''Still Alive'', a [[TV-special]] in which Como's trademark 'relaxed' style is taken to [[ludicrous]] [[extremes]]. The nearly-comatose Como sings one song while propped up against a dancer, another swaddled in bed with the covers pulled up to his chin, and performs a third number sprawled face-down and almost-motionless on the floor, mic laying next to his mouth, one finger moving to the beat. But SCTV is suddenly knocked off the air, replaced by an illegal signal from Russian television network. Throughout, the old Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is abbreviated USSR in English but CCCP in Russian, is referred to as "C three P one". From there, all the "shows" are Russian-related spoofs (a [[situation comedy]] about a talking tractor similar to ''My Mother the Car'', a game-show called ''What Fits into Russia?'' which celebrates the [[USSR]]'s massive size, etc.), and "Hey, Giorgy", "everybody's favorite Cossack" with the memorable line "Uzbeks drank my battery fluid", uttered when Rick Moranis's Lada won't start outside an alehouse; popping the hood reveals the battery's six old-style cells sporting bendy straws.
* A ''Jazz Singer'' parody which reversed the story by having musical guest [[Al Jarreau]] play a popular jazz singer who wants to become a cantor ([[cantor|hazzan]]). His father is a disapproving pop-music impressario played by Eugene Levy's [[befuddled]] [[Sid Dithers]] [[character]]. Hassidic Dithers, four feet tall and cross-eyed behind "Coke bottle" glasses, spoke with a thick early [[vaudeville]]-style [[Yiddish]] accent ("San Fransisky? So how did you come: did you drove, or did you flew?"). The [[payoff]] of this parody made for a [[classic]] SCTV moment: Jarreau has become a [[synagogue]] cantor, fulfilling his dream against his father's wishes, and he wonders if his father will ever speak to him again -- until, during the service, he is interrupted by a disco-clad Dithers standing in the doorway in dancing shoes, spangled jacket, and [[corn-rowed]] hair.
* The episode in which a janitorial [[trade union|union]] went on [[Strike action|strike]], forcing stations to broadcast the network feed from [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] television. Parodies ensued, such as ''Hinterland Who's Who'', ''Front Page Challenge'' and ''It's a Fact'', among others. Meanwhile, Eugene Levy's '''Sid Dithers''' played the union president, barely able to see over the conference table as he detailed the progress of the strike-talks.
* ''Magnum, P.E.I.'' wherein John Candy plays a savvy private investigator a la [[Magnum, P.I.]] chasing his quarry through scenic potato patches.

Ironically, the most popular sketch was intended as throwaway filler. [[Bob & Doug McKenzie]], dim-witted beer-chugging brothers in a recurring Canadian-themed sketch called ''Great White North'', were initially developed by Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas ('''Bob & Doug''', respectively) as a [[sarcastic]] response to the [[CRTC]] mandate requiring Canadian-based programs to feature two minutes of "identifiably Canadian content" in every episode. The characters ultimately became icons of the very [[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]] they parodied, spinning off albums, a feature film (''[[Strange Brew]]''), commercials, and numerous TV and film cameos. Bob and Doug helped to popularize the [[stereotypical]] Canadian trait of adding "eh" to the end of sentences, a facet of Canadian life that is often gently ridiculed in American shows featuring Canadian characters. Recently, Moranis and Thomas recreated Bob and Doug in the form of a pair of [[moose]] in the animated feature ''[[Brother Bear]]'' from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]].
