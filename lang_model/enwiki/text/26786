'''The [[1996]] [[NBA Finals]]''' was the championship series of the [[1995-96 NBA season]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. The [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (64-18) of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] took on the [[Chicago Bulls]] (72-10) of the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]], with the Bulls holding [[home team|home court advantage]]. The series was played under a [[Playoff format#Best-of-Seven Playoff|best-of-seven format]].

Chicago won the series 4 games to 2, a fitting conclusion after a record breaking 72-10 standing during the regular season. [[Michael Jordan]] was named Finals MVP.

==Background==
In the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series, defeating Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, head coach George Karl and their Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA Finals to win the World Championship. The Bulls shot out to a 3-0 lead, but the Sonics rallied back to win the next two at home, although speculated by some that they were lost on purpose so the Bulls could celebrate at home. Eventually, the more experienced Bulls proved to be too much as the Bulls captured their fourth title (after a two year hiatus). For his performance in the series against Seattle, Michael Jordan was named the Finals MVP.

===Chicago Bulls===
[[Michael Jordan]] decided to return to basketball in [[1995]], after a short stint as a baseball player. Although he failed to lead the Bulls to the [[1995 NBA Finals|Finals]] in that year, he returned to pre-retirement form the next year and led the [[Chicago Bulls]] to one of the most memorable seasons ever. Freshly motivated by the playoff defeat against the [[Orlando Magic]], trained aggressively in preparation for the 1995-96 season.

In the offseason, the Bulls lost [[B.J. Armstrong]] in the expansion draft, but Bulls general manager [[Jerry Krause]] pulled off a masterful deal by trading [[Will Perdue]] to the [[San Antonio Spurs]] for notorious rebounder [[Dennis Rodman]], who had won the past four rebounding titles. 

That year, strengthened by the addition of [[Dennis Rodman]], the Bulls dominated the league. With a lineup of [[Ron Harper]], Michael Jordan, [[Scottie Pippen]], Dennis Rodman and [[Luc Longley]], and perhaps the league's best bench in [[Steve Kerr]], [[Toni Kuko<U+010D>]], [[Bill Wennington]] and guard [[Randy Brown]], the Bulls posted one of the best single-season improvements in league history and the best single-season record. They moved from 47-35 to 72-10, which remains the best record in the league for an 82-game season. Jordan won his eighth scoring title, and Rodman his fifth straight rebounding title, while Kerr led the league in three-point shooting. Michael Jordan won the league's regular season and [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] MVP awards. 

[[Jerry Krause]] won the executive of the year award, [[Phil Jackson]] won the coach of the year award, and Toni Kukoc was the sixth man of the year. Both Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan made the all-NBA first team, and Jordan, Pippen, and Dennis Rodman made the all-defensive first team.

The Chicago Bulls had no problems during the playoffs. After demolishing [[Miami Heat|Miami]] by over 15 points per game in the first round, they would go 4-1 against the [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] in the semifinals to get [[revenge]] and sweep the [[Orlando Magic|Magic]] in the Eastern Conference Finals.

===Seattle SuperSonics===
The Seattle SuperSonics were a talented, yet fragile bunch. In the [[1994 NBA Playoffs|1994 playoffs]], the first seeded Seattle (63-19) lost 3 games to 2 to the eighth seeded [[Denver Nuggets|Nuggets]] (42-40). Seattle would once again be upset in the [[1995 NBA Playoffs|1995 playoffs]] against the [[Los Angeles Lakers|L.A. Lakers]]. After two first round defeats, Seattle would make a major come back in the 1996 season that would give them the name ''Sonic Boom.''

Led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, the SuperSonics went 64-18, leading the Western Conference, and setting the record for highest single-season win total in Supersonics history. Seattle blew through [[Sacramento Kings|Sacramento]] in the first round; 3 games to 1. It also had no problems with [[Houston Rockets|Houston]], sweeping them as well. However, their playoff troubles re-emerged after dropping two games to the [[Utah Jazz]] to bring the series to 3-3.  However, Seattle took game 7 and won what was one of the most exciting series of the 1996 playoffs. Seattle would finally go to its first [[NBA Finals|NBA Final]] game since 1979.
