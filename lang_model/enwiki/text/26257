The '''lion''' (''Panthera leo'') is one of the five [[big cat]]s in the [[genus]] ''[[Panthera]]'' and a member of the family [[Felidae]]. With some males exceeding {{convert|250|kg|abbr=on}} in weight,<ref name="nowak">{{Cite book|last=Nowak|first= Ronald M. |year=1999 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=0-8018-5789-9}}</ref> it is the second-largest living cat after the [[tiger]]. Wild lions currently exist in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and in [[Asia]] (where an [[endangered]] remnant population resides in [[Gir Forest National Park]] in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from [[North Africa]] and [[Southwest Asia]] in historic times. Until the late [[Pleistocene]], about 10,000&nbsp;years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after [[human]]s. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the [[Yukon]] to [[Peru]].<ref name=Harington69/> The lion is a [[vulnerable species]], having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30<U+2013>50% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century.<ref name=IUCN/> Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the [[West African lion]] population is particularly endangered.

Lions live for 10<U+2013>14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smuts |first=G.L. |year=1982 |title=Lion|publisher=Macmillian South Africa |location=Johannesburg |page=231|isbn= 0-86954-122-6}}</ref> They typically inhabit [[savanna]] and [[grassland]], although they may take to [[Shrub|bush]] and [[forest]]. Lions are unusually [[social animal|social]] compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large [[ungulate]]s. Lions are [[apex predator|apex]] and [[keystone species#Predators|keystone predators]], although they are also expert [[scavengers]] obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so.

Highly distinctive, the male lion is easily recognised by its mane, and its face is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human [[culture]]. Depictions have existed from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, with carvings and paintings from the [[Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet Cave]]s, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in [[menagerie]]s since the time of the [[Roman Empire]], and have been a key species sought for exhibition in [[zoo]]s over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered [[Asiatic Lion|Asiatic subspecies]].

==Etymology==
The lion's name, similar in many [[Romance languages]], is derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|leo}}'',<ref>{{Cite book| author=Simpson, D.P. | title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher=Cassell Ltd. | year=1979 | edition=5th | location=London | page=342 | isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> and the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|<U+03BB><U+03AD><U+03C9><U+03BD>}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|leon}}'').<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{Cite book| author=[[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]] | year=1980 | title=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition)|page=411 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location=United Kingdom | isbn=0-19-910207-4}}</ref> The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|<U+05DC><U+05B8><U+05D1><U+05B4><U+05D9><U+05D0>}} ({{lang|he-Latn|''lavi''}}) may also be related.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| title=Lion|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editor=Simpson, John; Weiner, Edmund| year=1989 |edition= 2nd| location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press| isbn=0-19-861186-2}}</ref> It was one of the species originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], who gave it the name ''Felis leo'', in his eighteenth-century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref name="Linn1758">{{Cite book|last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |authorlink=Carl Linnaeus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis. |publisher=Holmiae (Laurentii Salvii) |year=1758 |page=41 |url=http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/726936 |accessdate=8 September 2008 |language=Latin |volume=1 |edition=10th}}</ref>

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The lion's closest relatives are the other species of the genus ''[[Panthera]]'': the [[tiger]], the [[jaguar]], and the [[leopard]]. ''P. leo'' evolved in [[Africa]] between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the [[Holarctic]] region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1= Yamaguchi |first1=Nobuyuki| last2=Cooper |first2=Alan |last3=Werdelin |first3= Lars |last4= MacDonald |first4=David W.|date=August 2004 |title= Evolution of the mane and group-living in the lion (''Panthera leo''): a review|journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=263 |issue=4 |pages=329<U+2013>42 |doi=10.1017/S0952836904005242 }}</ref> It appeared in the fossil record in Europe for the first time 700,000 years ago with the subspecies ''[[Panthera leo fossilis]]'' at [[Isernia]] in Italy.

Lions died out in northern [[Eurasia]] at the end of the last [[glacier|glaciation]], about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the [[Pleistocene extinctions|extinction]] of [[Pleistocene megafauna]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Harington | first = C.R.

===Subspecies===
Traditionally, 12 recent [[subspecies]] of lion were recognised, distinguished by mane appearance, size, and distribution. Because these characteristics are very insignificant and show a high individual variability, most of these forms were probably not true subspecies, especially as they were often based upon zoo material of unknown origin that may have had "striking, but abnormal" morphological characteristics.<ref name = "zoos_encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Grisham | first= Jack | editor-first = Catherine E | editor-last = Bell |title=Lion |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos |volume=2: G<U+2013>P |year=2001 | publisher = Fitzroy Dearborn |location=Chofago |isbn=1-57958-174-9 |pages=733<U+2013>39}}</ref> Today, only eight subspecies are usually accepted,<ref name="BurgerJ-Molecular-phylogeny">{{Cite journal | last1 = Burger | first1 = Joachim |year= 2004 |title= Molecular phylogeny of the extinct cave lion ''Panthera leo spelaea'' | journal= [[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] | pmid= 15012963 | volume = 30 | issue =3 |pages=841<U+2013>49 |doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2003.07.020 | url= http://www.uni-mainz.de/FB/Biologie/Anthropologie/MolA/Download/Burger%202004.pdf | type = fulltext | accessdate= 20 September 2007 | last3 = Loreille | first3 = Odile | last4 = Hemmer | first4 = Helmut | last5 = Eriksson | first5 = Torsten | last6 = G<U+00F6>therstr<U+00F6>m | first6 = Anders | last7 = Hiller | first7 = Jennifer | last8 = Collins | first8 = Matthew J. | last9 = Wess | first9 = Timothy | last2 = Rosendahl | first2 = Wilfried | last10 = Alt | first10 = Kurt W.}}</ref><ref name = "CG" /> although one of these, the [[Cape lion]], formerly described as ''Panthera leo melanochaita'', is probably invalid.<ref name="CG" />  Even the remaining seven subspecies might be too many. While the status of the Asiatic lion (''P. l. persica'') as a subspecies is generally accepted, the systematic relationships among African lions are still not completely resolved. [[Mitochondria]]l variation in living African lions seemed to be modest according to some newer studies, therefore all sub-Saharan lions sometimes have been considered a single subspecies, however, a recent study revealed lions from western and central Africa differ genetically from lions of southern or eastern Africa. According to this study, [[Western African lion]]s are more closely related to Asian lions than to South or East African lions. These findings might be explained by a late Pleistocene extinction event of lions in western and central Africa and a subsequent recolonization of these parts from Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bertola | year = 2011 | title = Genetic diversity, evolutionary history and implications for conservation of the lion (''Panthera leo'') in West and Central Africa | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1356<U+2013>67 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02500.x | first1 = L.

The majority of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of the captive lions registered by the [[International Species Information System]] are of unknown origin.

Lions have been known to [[biological reproduction|breed]] with [[tiger]]s (most often the [[Siberian Tiger|Siberian]] and [[Bengal Tiger|Bengal]] subspecies) to create hybrids called [[liger]]s and [[tiglon]]s (or tigons).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Guggisberg |first=Charles Albert Walter |title=Wild Cats of the World |year=1975 |publisher=Taplinger Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-8008-8324-1 }}</ref> They also have been crossed with [[leopards]] to produce [[leopon]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|author=Doi H, Reynolds B |title=The Story of Leopons |year=1967 |publisher=Putnam |location=New York |oclc=469041 <!--Too old for ISBN-->}}</ref> and [[jaguar]]s to produce [[Panthera hybrid#Jaglion|jaglions]]. The [[marozi]] is reputedly a spotted lion or a naturally occurring leopon, while the [[Congolese spotted lion]] is a complex lion-jaguar-leopard hybrid called a lijagulep. Such hybrids were once commonly bred in zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conserving species and subspecies. Hybrids are still bred in private menageries and in zoos in China.

The '''liger''' is a cross between a male lion and a tigress.<ref name=Carnivores>{{cite book|last1=Rafferty|first1=John P.|title=Carnivores|date=2011|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9781615303403|page=120|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EMui7zVOqeUC&pg=PA120&dq=liger+lion+tigress&hl=en&sa=X&ei=56G2U6vSHou3yATBr4DoCw&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=liger%20lion%20tigress&f=false|accessdate=4 July 2014}}</ref> Because the growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger mother is absent, the growth-promoting gene passed on by the male lion father is unimpeded by a regulating gene and the resulting ligers grow far larger than either parent. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers often are fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but if they grow them, their manes will be modest: around 50% the size of a pure lion mane.

Ligers are much bigger than normal lions, typically {{convert|3.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length, and can weigh up to {{convert|500|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=shi/>

==Characteristics==
[[File:Lion and eland.jpg|thumb|right|A skeletal mount of an African Lion attacking a [[Common Eland]] on display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]]]

Behind only the tiger, the lion is the second largest living felid in length and weight. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region. The lion's skull has broader nasal openings than the tiger, however, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually, only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.<ref name="USSR">{{Cite book| author = Heptner, V.G; Sludskii, A.A.| title = Mammals of the Soviet Union, Volume II, Part 2 | year = 1992| isbn = 90-04-08876-8 | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden u.a.}}</ref> Lion colouration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown [[Rosette (zoology)|rosettes]] (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses.

Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious [[sexual dimorphism]] <U+2013> that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialised roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, the hunter, lacks the male's thick mane. The colour of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older. The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard "spine" or "spur", approximately 5&nbsp;mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail <U+2013> the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5<U+00BD>&nbsp;months of age and is readily identifiable at 7&nbsp;months.<ref name="Schaller28">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 28.</ref>

===Mane===
[[File:HansomeLion 002.jpg|thumb|right|During agonistic confrontations with other lions, the mane makes the lion appear larger.]]

Scientists once believed that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], including the size of the mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the [[Barbary lion]] and [[Cape lion]]. Research has suggested, however, that environmental factors influence the colour and size of a lion's mane, such as the [[room temperature|ambient temperature]].<ref name=West/> The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American [[zoo]]s, for example, may result in a heavier mane.

===White lions===
[[File:White Lion.jpg|thumb|right|[[White lion]]s owe their colouring to a recessive allele; they are rare forms of the subspecies ''Panthera leo krugeri'']]
The [[white lion]] is not a distinct subspecies, but a special [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]] with a genetic condition, [[leucism]],<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> that causes paler colouration akin to that of the [[white tiger]]; the condition is similar to [[melanism]], which causes [[black panther]]s. They are not albinos, having normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White Transvaal lion (''Panthera leo krugeri'') individuals occasionally have been encountered in and around [[Kruger National Park]] and the adjacent [[Timbavati Private Game Reserve]] in eastern South Africa, but are more commonly found in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], where breeders deliberately select them.

==Behaviour==
[[File:Panthera leo stretching (Etosha, 2012).jpg|thumbnail|left|Adult male lion stretching.]]
Lions spend much of their time resting and are inactive for about 20&nbsp;hours per day.<ref name="Schaller122">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 122.</ref> Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socializing, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50&nbsp;minutes eating.<ref name="Schaller120">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 120<U+2013>21.</ref>

===Group organization===
[[File:pride leader.jpg|thumb|right|Two lionesses and a mature male of a pride.]]
[[File:Lions Family Portrait Masai Mara.jpg|thumb|right|Two males and a female lion.]]
Lions are the most socially inclined of all wild [[felid]]s, most of which remain quite solitary in nature. The lion is a predatory [[carnivore]] with two types of social organization. Some lions are ''residents,'' living in groups centering around related lionesses, called ''prides''.<ref name="Schaller33">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 33.</ref> Females form the stable [[social unit]] in a pride and do not tolerate outside females;<ref name="Schaller37">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 37.</ref> membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses,<ref name="Schaller39">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 39.</ref> although some females do leave and become nomadic.<ref name="Schaller44">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 44.</ref> The pride usually consists of five or six females, their cubs of both sexes, and one or two males (known as a ''coalition'' if more than one) who mate with the adult females (although extremely large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed). The number of adult males in a coalition is usually two but may increase to as many as four and decrease again over time,<ref name="Schaller44"/> while a [[Tsavo lion]] pride always has one adult male only.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Milius |first=Susan |date=April 2002 |title= Biology: Maneless lions live one guy per pride|journal=Society for Science & the Public |volume=161 |issue=16 |pages=253 }}</ref> Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2<U+2013>3 years of age.<ref name="Schaller44"/> The second organizational behaviour is labeled ''nomads'', who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs.<ref name="Schaller33"/> Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Males, as a rule, live at least some portion of their lives as nomads, and some are never able to join another pride. A female who becomes a nomad has much greater difficulty joining a new pride, as the females in a pride are related, and they reject most attempts by an unrelated female to join their family group.
 
The area a pride occupies is called a ''pride area'', whereas that by a nomad is a ''range''.<ref name="Schaller33"/> The males associated with a pride tend to stay on the fringes, patrolling their [[territory (animal)|territory]]. Why [[social behavior|sociality]] <U+2013> the most pronounced in any cat species <U+2013> has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible [[kin selection]] (better to share food with a related lion than with a stranger), protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.<ref name=CAP/>

[[File:Lion.ogv|thumb|right|Video of a wild lioness]]
Lionesses do most of the hunting for their pride. They are more effective hunters, as they are smaller, swifter, and more agile than the males and unencumbered by the heavy and conspicuous mane, which causes overheating during exertion. They act as a coordinated group with members who perform the same role consistently in order to stalk and bring down the prey successfully. Smaller prey is eaten at the location of the hunt, thereby being shared among the hunters; when the kill is larger it often is dragged to the pride area. There is more sharing of larger kills,<ref name="Schaller133">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 133.</ref> although pride members often behave aggressively toward each other as each tries to consume as much food as possible. Near the conclusion of the hunt, males have a tendency to dominate the kill once the lionesses have succeeded. They are more likely to share this with the cubs than with the lionesses, but males rarely share food they have killed by themselves.

Both males and females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build.<ref>[http://www.lionconservationfund.org/lion_adopt.html Join the Pride]. Lion Conservation Fund. Retrieved on 2013-07-31.</ref> Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Heinsohn|first= R. |author2=C.

===Hunting and diet===
[[File:Female Lion.JPG|thumb|Although lions have sharp teeth, their prey is usually killed by strangulation.]]

Lions prefer to scavenge when the opportunity presents itself,<ref name = "Schaller213" /> and scavenged food provides more than 50% of their diets.<ref name=AWF>>{{cite web| title = Behavior and Diet | work = African Wildlife Foundation website | publisher = African Wildlife Foundation  | year = 1996 | url =http://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/lion | accessdate =6 June 2014}}</ref> They scavenge animals either dead from [[natural causes]] (disease) or killed by other predators, and keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, being keenly aware that they indicate an animal dead or in distress.<ref name = "Schaller213">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 213.</ref> In fact, most dead prey on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by the hyenas instead of the lions.<ref name="nowak" />

The lioness is the one that does most of the hunting for the pride. The male lion associated with the pride usually stays and watches its young while waiting for the lionesses to return from the hunt. Typically, several lionesses work together and encircle the herd from different points. Once they have closed with a herd, they usually target the closest prey. The attack is short and powerful; they attempt to catch the victim with a fast rush and final leap. The prey usually is killed by [[strangulation]],<ref>{{cite web | title = About lions<U+2014>Ecology and behaviour | first = Gus | last = Mills | publisher = African Lion Working Group | url= http://www.african-lion.org/lions_e.htm | accessdate = 20 July 2007}}</ref> which can cause [[cerebral ischemia]] or [[asphyxia]] (which results in [[hypoxemia|hypoxemic]], or "general", [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]). The prey also may be killed by the lion enclosing the animal's mouth and nostrils in its jaws (which would also result in asphyxia).<ref name="nowak" />

Lions usually hunt in coordinated groups and stalk their chosen prey. However, they are not particularly known for their stamina <U+2013> for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57% of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1% of its body weight.<ref>[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 248.</ref> Thus, they only run fast in short bursts,<ref name="Schaller2478">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], pp. 247<U+2013>48.</ref> and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.<ref name="Schaller237">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 237.</ref> They sneak up to the victim until they reach a distance of approximately {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} or less.

Mainly this will include [[ungulate]]s weighing between {{convert|50|and|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} such as [[kudu]], [[hartebeest]], [[gemsbok]], and [[taurotragus|eland]].<ref name="nowak" /> Occasionally, they take relatively small species such as [[Thomson's gazelle]] or [[springbok (antelope)|springbok]]. Lions hunting in groups are capable of taking down most animals, even healthy adults, but in most parts of their range they rarely attack very large prey such as fully grown male [[giraffe]]s due to the danger of injury. Giraffes and buffaloes are almost invulnerable to a solitary lion as well.<ref name="Schaller259">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 259.</ref>

[[File:Lions taking down cape buffalo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Four lionesses catch a cape buffalo.]]
Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey, cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt; this is especially true with larger species. Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas, which may be attracted by [[vulture]]s from kilometres away in open savannas. Lionesses do most of the hunting; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting, except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favored position in the group, either stalking prey on the "wing" then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses.<ref name=hunt>{{Cite journal| last = Stander | first = PE | title= Cooperative hunting in lions: the role of the individual |journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=29|issue=6|pages=445<U+2013>54|year=1992|doi = 10.1007/BF00170175}}</ref> There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Scott R.

====Predator competition====
[[File:Panthera leo & Crocuta crocuta.jpg|thumb|250px|Subadult male lion and [[spotted hyena]]]]
Lions and [[spotted hyena]]s occupy the same ecological niche (and hence compete) where they coexist.

Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as [[cheetah]]s and [[leopard]]s where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance.

Also, unlike cheetahs, leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills.<ref name = "Schaller293">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 293.</ref> Similarly, lions dominate [[African Wild Dog|African wild dogs]], not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs.

====Man-eating====
{{Main|Man-eater}}
While lions do not usually hunt people, some (usually males) seem to seek out human prey; one well-publicised case includes the [[Tsavo maneaters]], where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the [[Uganda Railway|Kenya-Uganda Railway]] were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge over the [[Tsavo River]] in [[Kenya]] in 1898.<ref name=Patterson>{{cite book | author = Patterson, Bruce D. | year = 2004 | title = The Lions of Tsavo: Exploring the Legacy of Africa's Notorious Man-Eaters  | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 0-07-136333-5}}</ref> The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favored by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Patterson |first=Bruce D. |author2=Neiburger, Ellis J.|author3=Kasiki, Samuel M. |date=February 2003 |title=Tooth Breakage and Dental Disease as Causes of Carnivore<U+2013>Human Conflicts |journal=Journal of Mammalogy |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=190<U+2013>96|doi=10.1644/1545-1542(2003)084<0190:TBADDA>2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

In their analysis of Tsavo and general man-eating, Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating, but that the behaviour is "not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant'" where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings. The authors note that the relationship is well-attested amongst other pantherines and primates in the paleontological record.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071030031426/http://www.man-eater.info/gpage6.html |archivedate=30 October 2007 |accessdate=7 July 2007 |last=Peterhans |first=Julian C.

The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period <U+2013> a number far exceeding the more famed "Tsavo" incidents of a century earlier. The incidents occurred near [[Selous Game Reserve|Selous National Park]] in [[Rufiji River|Rufiji District]] and in [[Lindi Region|Lindi Province]] near the [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] border. While the expansion of villagers into bush country is one concern, the authors argue that conservation policy must mitigate the danger because, in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi have been documented where lions seize humans from the center of substantial villages.<ref name="Packer05">{{Cite journal|last=Packer |first=C. |author2=Ikanda, D. |author3=Kissui, B. |author4= Kushnir, H.  |date=August 2005 |title=Conservation biology: lion attacks on humans in Tanzania |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=436 |issue=7053 |pages=927<U+2013>28 |doi=10.1038/436927a| pmid=16107828}}</ref> Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the [[full moon]] (when there was less moonlight) were a strong indicator of increased night attacks on people.<ref name="fullmoon">{{cite journal | title=Fear of Darkness, the Full Moon and the Nocturnal Ecology of African Lions | author=Packer, C | journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |date=July 2011 | volume=6 | issue=7 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0022285 |author2=Swanson A |author3=Ikanda D |author4=Kushnir H  | editor1-last=Rands | editor1-first=Sean A. | pages=e22285}}</ref>

Author Robert R. Frump wrote in ''The Man-eaters of Eden'' that Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park at night in [[South Africa]] are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may have been killed in the decades after [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly walked across the park in daytime with little harm.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Frump |first=RR |title=The Man-Eaters of Eden: Life and Death in Kruger National Park |year=2006 |publisher=The Lyons Press |isbn=1-59228-892-8}}</ref>

Packer estimates more than 200 Tanzanians are killed each year by lions, [[crocodile]]s, elephants, hippos, and [[snake]]s, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer has documented that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few [[conservation movement|conservationists]] who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters not just because of ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.<ref name="Packer05"/>

A man-eating lion was killed by game scouts in Southern Tanzania in April 2004. It is believed to have killed and eaten at least 35&nbsp;people in a series of incidents covering several villages in the Rufiji Delta coastal region.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Toothache 'made lion eat humans' |author=Dickinson, Daniel |date=19 October 2004 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3756180.stm |accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref> Dr Rolf D. Baldus, the GTZ wildlife programme coordinator, commented that it was likely that the lion preyed on humans because it had a large [[abscess]] underneath a [[molar (tooth)|molar]] which was cracked in several places. He further commented that "This lion probably experienced a lot of pain, particularly when it was chewing."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baldus |first=R |date=March 2006 |title=A man-eating lion (''Panthera leo'') from Tanzania with a toothache |journal=European Journal of Wildlife Research |volume=52 |issue= 1 |pages= 59<U+2013>62|doi=10.1007/s10344-005-0008-0}}</ref> GTZ is the German development cooperation agency and has been working with the Tanzanian government on wildlife conservation for nearly two decades. As in other cases this lion was large, lacked a mane, and had a tooth problem.

The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be not Tsavo, but incidents in the early 1930s through the late 1940s in what was then [[Tanganyika]] (now Tanzania). [[George Gilman Rushby|George Rushby]], game warden and professional hunter, eventually dispatched the pride, which over three generations is thought to have killed and eaten 1,500 to 2,000 people in what is now [[Njombe]] district.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Rushby, George.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
{{commons category|Lions mating}}
Most lionesses will have reproduced by the time they are four years of age.<ref name="Schaller29">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 29.</ref> Lions do not [[mating|mate]] at any specific time of year, and the females are [[polyestrous]].<ref name="Schaller174">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 174.</ref> As with other [[Cat's penis|cats' penises]], the male lion's penis has [[penile spines|spines that point backward]].

Lions reproduce very well in captivity.

The average gestation period is around 110&nbsp;days,<ref name="Schaller174"/> the female giving birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den (which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area) usually away from the rest of the pride. She will often hunt by herself while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the thicket or den where the cubs are kept.<ref name="Scott45">[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 45.</ref> The cubs themselves are born blind <U+2013> their eyes do not open until roughly a week after birth. They weigh {{convert|1.2|<U+2013>|2.1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.<ref name="Schaller143">[[#Schaller|Schaller]], p. 143.</ref> The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.<ref name="Scott45"/>

Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old.<ref name="Scott45"/> Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. In addition to greater protection, the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and thus have an equal chance of survival. If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness, for instance, then the younger cubs, being much smaller than their older brethren, usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes <U+2013> consequently, death by starvation is more common amongst the younger cubs.
[[File:PregnantLioness.jpg|thumb|A pregnant lioness (right).]]
In addition to starvation, cubs also face many other dangers, such as predation by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles, and snakes. Even buffaloes, should they catch the scent of lion cubs, often stampede toward the thicket or den where they are being kept, doing their best to trample the cubs to death while warding off the lioness. Furthermore, when one or more new males oust the previous male(s) associated with a pride, the conqueror(s) often kill any existing young cubs,<ref name="Packpus83">{{Cite journal|author=Packer, C., Pusey, A. E. |date=May 1983 |title= Adaptations of female lions to infanticide by incoming males|journal= American Naturalist |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716<U+2013>28 |doi= 10.1086/284097}}</ref> perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die.

When first introduced to the rest of the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing amongst themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies <U+2013> sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.<ref>[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 46.</ref>

[[File:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004.JPG|thumb|Male lions are generally more likely to share food caught by the pride with cubs than with lionesses, but rarely share their own catches with others.]]
Weaning occurs after six to seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about 3 years of age and, at 4<U+2013>5 years of age, are capable of challenging and displacing the adult male(s) associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Crandall |first=Lee S. |title=The management of wild animals in captivity |year=1964 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |oclc=557916}}</ref> if they have not already been critically injured while defending the pride (once ousted from a pride by rival males, male lions rarely manage a second take-over). This leaves a short window for their own offspring to be born and mature. If they are able to procreate as soon as they take over a pride, potentially, they may have more offspring reaching maturity before they also are displaced. A lioness often will attempt to defend her cubs fiercely from a usurping male, but such actions are rarely successful. He usually kills all of the existing cubs who are less than two years old. A lioness is weaker and much lighter than a male; success is more likely when a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against one male.<ref name="Packpus83"/>

Contrary to popular belief, it is not only males that are ousted from their pride to become nomads, although most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, subadult lions, both male and female, may be evicted.<ref>[[#Scott|Scott]], p. 68.</ref> Life is harsh for a female nomad. Nomadic lionesses rarely manage to raise their cubs to maturity, without the protection of other pride members.

One scientific study reports that both males and females may interact [[homosexuality in animals|homosexually]]. Lions are shown to involved in group homosexual and courtship activities.

Following the discovery of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline.
Lions are one species included in the [[Species Survival Plan]], a coordinated attempt by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not [[genetic pollution|genetically pure]], having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties in assessing the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/>

Seraglios served as expressions of the nobility's power and wealth. Animals such as big cats and [[elephant]]s, in particular, symbolised power, and would be pitted in fights against each other or domesticated animals. By extension, menageries and seraglios served as demonstrations of the dominance of humanity over nature. Consequently, the defeat of such natural "lords" by a cow in 1682 astonished the spectators, and the flight of an elephant before a rhinoceros drew jeers. Such fights would slowly fade out in the seventeenth century with the spread of the menagerie and their appropriation by the commoners. The tradition of keeping big cats as pets would last into the nineteenth century, at which time it was seen as highly eccentric.<ref>[[#Baratay|Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier]], pp. 24<U+2013>28.</ref>

The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger, or more difficult to transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than [[giant panda]]s.<ref>[[#Baratay|Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 122.</ref> Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation.<ref>[[#Baratay|Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier]], pp. 114, 117.</ref> The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.<ref>[[#Baratay|Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 113.</ref> Explorers and hunters exploited a popular [[Manichaeism|Manichean]] division of animals into "good" and "evil" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures.

Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.<ref name="Blunt208">[[#Blunt|Blunt]], p. 208.</ref> Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when [[Carl Hagenbeck]] designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both [[Melbourne Zoo]] and Sydney's [[Taronga Zoo]], among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos.<ref name="dc69">[[#Courcy|de Courcy]], p. 69.</ref> In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of [[mesh|wire mesh]] or [[laminated glass]] instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of [[Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden|Oklahoma City Zoological Park]].<ref name="zoos_encyclopedia"/> Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions' needs, highlighting the need for dens in separate areas, elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam. There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual, such as the lioness [[Elsa the Lioness|Elsa]], who was raised by [[George Adamson]] and his wife [[Joy Adamson]] and came to develop a strong bond with them, particularly the latter. The lioness later achieved fame, her life being documented in a series of books and films.

Lion-baiting is a [[blood sport]] involving the [[animal-baiting|baiting]] of lions in combat with other animals, usually dogs. Records of it exist in ancient times through until the seventeenth century. It was finally banned in [[Vienna]] by 1800 and England in 1835.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hone |first= William |editor= Kyle Grimes|title= The Every-Day Book |origyear=1825<U+2013>1826 |url=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |accessdate=25 January 2011|year=2004 |publisher=University of Alabama at Birmingham |page=26 |chapter=July |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080624080642/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/207-july26.html |archivedate= 24 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blaisdell |first=Warren H. |date=November 1997 |title= How A Lion Fight Caused England To Stop The Breeding Of Both Ring And Pit Bulldogs|journal=American Bulldog Review |volume=3 |issue=4 |url=http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424001716/http://www.american-bulldog.com/how_a_lion.htm |archivedate=24 April 2008 |accessdate=5 September 2007}}</ref>

Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established [[circus]] or as an individual act, such as [[Siegfried & Roy]]. The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards, and [[cougar]]s. The practice was pioneered in the first half of the nineteenth century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American [[Isaac A. Van Amburgh|Isaac Van Amburgh]] who both toured widely, and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.<ref name = "baratay187"/> Van Amburgh performed before [[Queen Victoria]] in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a [[pantomime]] titled ''Les Lions de Mysore'' ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed [[equestrianism]] acts as the central display of circus shows, but truly entered public consciousness in the early twentieth century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.<ref name="baratay187">[[#Baratay|Baratay & Hardouin-Fugier]], p. 187.</ref> The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by placing his head in the lion's mouth. The now iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American [[Clyde Beatty]] (1903<U+2013>1965).<ref>{{Cite book| first=David | last=Feldman | authorlink=David Feldman (author) | year=1993 | title=How Does Aspirin Find a Headache? | publisher=HarperCollins | isbn= 0-06-016923-0 }}</ref>

The lion has been an icon for humanity for thousands of years, appearing in cultures across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Despite incidents of attacks on humans, lions have enjoyed a positive depiction in culture as strong and noble. A common depiction is their representation as "[[Monarchy|king]] of the jungle" or "king of beasts"; hence, the lion has been a popular symbol of royalty and stateliness,<ref name="Garai73">{{Cite book|last = Garai |first=Jana |title=The Book of Symbols |year=1973 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |isbn = 0-671-21773-9}}</ref> as well as a symbol of bravery; it is featured in several [[Aesop's Fables|fables]] of the sixth century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] storyteller [[Aesop]].<ref>{{Cite book| author = Aesop | editor-last = Gibbs | editor-first = L |title= Fables |series=Oxford World's Classics |year=2002 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn= 0-19-284050-9}}</ref>

Representations of lions date back to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]]. The [[lion man|lioness-headed]] ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the [[Swabian Alb]] in southwestern Germany, dubbed ''L<U+00F6>wenmensch'' (lion-human) in German.

In the [[Talmud]], [http://halakhah.com/pdf/kodoshim/Chullin.pdf ''Chullin'' 59b], Rabbi [[Joshua ben Hananiah]] tells Emperor [[Hadrian]] about the giant lion of the forest of Bei Ilai called the ''[[Jewish mythology#The Keresh and the Tigris of the Bei Ilai|Tigris]]'', a lion so huge that the space between its ears measures 9 [[cubit]]s. The emperor asks the rabbi to call forth this lion. He reluctantly agrees. At a distance of 400 [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Length and distance|parasangs]] from Rome it roars, and all pregnant women [[Miscarriage|miscarry]] and all the walls of Rome fall down. Then it comes to 300 parasangs and roars, and all the front teeth and molars of Roman men fall out, and even the emperor himself falls from his throne. He begs the rabbi to send it back. The rabbi prays and it returns to its place.
