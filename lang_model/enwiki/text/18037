The '''Cinema of [[Albania]]''' had its start in the years [[1911]]-[[1912]]. 

==Early years==
The first public showings began in the [[List of cities in Albania|cities]] of [[Shkod<U+00EB>r]] and [[Kor<U+00E7><U+00EB>]]; these showings were of foreign films. The first Albanian films were mostly [[documentaries]], the first film being about the [[Manastir Congress]] that sanctioned the [[Albanian alphabet]] in [[1908]]. 

==The Communist period==

After [[World War II]], the [[communist state|communist government]] of the state founded the [[Albanian Film Institute]] in [[1945]], which became [[Kinostudia Shqip<U+00EB>ria e Re]] in [[1952]]. This was followed by the first Albanian epic film, ''[[Sk<U+00EB>nderbeu (movie)|Sk<U+00EB>nderbeu]]'', a cooperation with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists chronicling the life and fight of Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg]]. The film won an award from the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Two other known films from the time are ''[[F<U+00EB>mij<U+00EB>t e saj]]'' (Her sons) and ''[[Tana (movie)|Tana]]''.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

In the [[1960s]], films concentrated mostly on the subject of the [[World War II]] occupation of Albanian by [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] armies and the fight for liberation. The movies had strong positive connotation towards the communist [[partizans]] and bad connotation toward the forces of [[Balli Komb<U+00EB>tar]], and they are viewed as state propaganda. Some of the directors of the time were [[Dhimit<U+00EB>r Anagnosti]], [[Viktor Gjika]], [[G<U+00EB>zim Erebara]], and [[Piro Milkani]].

In the [[1970s]], there was a drastic reduction in the number of imported movies as a result of the cultural and political isolationist campaign by the state. This resulted in an increase of production in movies to five or six a year early on and up to 8 or 10 a year by the end of the decade, peaking at 14 movies a year in the [[1980s]]. The genre of movies was also diversified to include dramatic as well as family and children movies. Two the movies of the time were ''[[Beni ec<U+00EB>n vet<U+00EB>]]'', directed by [[Xhanfize Keko]] in [[1975]], and the comedy ''[[Kapedani]]'', directed by [[Fehmi Hoshafi]] and [[Muharrem Fejzo]] in [[1972]]. A new cadre of directors of the time was composed by [[Rikard Ljarja]], [[Sajmir Kumbaro]], [[Ibrahim Mu<U+00E7>aj]], [[Kristaq Mitro]], and [[Esat Mysliu]]. This period also marked the start of artistic and made-for-TV movies such as ''[[Udha e shkronjave]]'', a movie directed by V. Prifti in [[1978]].

Some of Albanian movies made during the [[1980s]] were ''[[Ball<U+00EB> p<U+00EB>r ball<U+00EB>]]''; directed by [[Kujtim <U+00C7>ashku]] and Pirro Milkani in [[1979]]; ''[[Dora e ngroht<U+00EB>]]'', directed by Kujtim <U+00C7>ashku in [[1983]]; ''[[Agimet e stin<U+00EB>s s<U+00EB> madhe]]'', directed by [[Albert Minga]] in [[1981]]; ''[[Koh<U+00EB> e larg<U+00EB>t]]'', directed by [[Spartak Pecani]] in [[1983]]; and ''[[Tela p<U+00EB>r violin<U+00EB>]]'', directed by [[Bujar Kapexhiu]] in [[1987]]. 

In the [[1970s]] and [[1980s]], there were also 20-40 documentaries produced that dealt in cultural elements as well as propaganda. This period also saw the birth of animated films, with ''[[Zana dhe Miri]]'' by [[V. Droboniku]] and [[T. Vaso]] in [[1975]]; animated films numbered around 16 a year.

These cinematic works were the result of a great cooperative effort by the [[Kinostudia]], various directors, writers, composers, actors as well as influences by the state that formed an entire industry. By [[1990]], about 200 movies had been produced. By the end of the 1980s, Albania had over 450 theaters. However, most of the equipment was aging and disintegrating.

==Postcommunist films==
During the [[1990s]], the change of the [[communist state|communist form of government]] to a more democratic one led to a big change in the Albanian cinema. The big conglomerate Kinostudia of old was broken up into several smaller studios, movies started to be produced in private studios by the old directors and even some foreign ones, but in conjunction with the new [[National Center of Cinematography]] (''Qendra Komb<U+00EB>tare e Kinematografis<U+00EB>''). 

Although new movies are being produced, many Albanians have returned to watching and enjoying the old movies, now shown on the various private television stations. The old propagandistic elements are now more a source of comedy than hate, and the early style is much appreciated.

Some of the most acclaimed recent movies include ''[[Kolonel Bunker]]'', ''[[Slloganet]]'', ''[[Dasma e Sakos]]'', ''[[Tirana Year Zero]]'', and ''[[Porta Eva]]''.

In the late 1990s, many new cinema theaters were built, especially in the bigger cities (such as MILLENEUM in the capital city of [[Tirana]]) that mostly show [[Western countries|western]] and more prominently [[United States|American]] movies.
