== History ==
[[Image:Submersible named Star III in front of Scripps Institution of Oceanography.JPG|thumb|left|Star III, in front of Scripps Institution of Oceanography]]
When the [[Regents of the University of California]] originally authorized the San Diego campus in 1956, it was planned to start as a graduate school of science and engineering comparable in quality to [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Citizens of San Diego enthusiastically supported the idea, voting the same year to transfer to the university {{convert|59|acre|m2}} of mesa land on the coast near the Scripps Institute. [[General Dynamics|General Dynamics Corporation]] donated a large sum of money to be used for recruiting a distinguished founding faculty.

In 1957, an undergraduate curriculum was planned as part of the general science curriculum, and [[Roger Revelle]], Director of Scripps, was named dean of the new school. UC San Diego was the first general campus of the UC to be designed "from the top down" in terms of curricular and research emphasis. Stellar faculty were recruited as they became available as opposed to the dictates of a pre-planned curriculum or academic schedule. The graduate division of the school opened in 1960, when it had 20 faculty in residence, with instruction offered in the fields of [[physics]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]] and [[earth science]]. Classes initially met in the Scripps Institute.

Before the selection of San Diego was made final, however, the Regents requested an additional gift of {{convert|550|acre|km2}} of undeveloped mesa land northeast of Scripps, as well as 500 acres (2&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) in [[Camp Calvin B. Matthews|Camp Matthews]], a [[United States Marine Corps]] rifle range adjacent to the site. The city voted in agreement to its part in 1958, and the UC, convinced that all its other conditions would be met, approved construction of the new campus in 1960. [[Herbert York]] was designated its first chancellor, and he worked out the planning of the main campus according to the "[[Oxbridge]]" model, relying on many of Revelle's ideas.

By 1963, new facilities on the mesa been finished for the School of Science and Engineering, and new buildings were under construction for Social Sciences and Humanities. Ten additional faculty in those disciplines were hired, and the whole site was designated the First College of the new campus. The campus accepted its first undergraduate class of 181 freshman in 1964, and was designated Revelle College the next year.<ref>Stadtman, Verne A.

In 2007, UC San Diego became the first university in the western region to top $1 billion in their fundraising campaign.<ref>http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/06-081BillionFundraisingLM-.asp</ref> To date, more than $1.01 billion dollars in private support has been designated to the university.<ref>http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/general/06-081BillionFundraisingLM-.asp</ref>

In 2009, UCSD mistakenly sent Admit Day welcome emails to all its 47,000 freshmen applicants, instead of just the 17,000 who had been admitted. However, school officials quickly realized the mistake and sent an apology email within two hours.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-ucsd-reject1-2009apr01,0,7943711.story</ref><ref name="guardapp">http://www.ucsdguardian.org/news/campus-e-mail-mistakenly-welcomes-all-applicants-1.1640689</ref> Chancellor Fox later joked about the incident, saying: <U+201C>It<U+2019>s generated a little bit of interest in the mail coming in, but I say that you can<U+2019>t buy advertisement like that.<U+201D><ref name="guardapp"/>

=== Undergraduate colleges ===
Undergraduates may major in any discipline offered at UC San Diego, but general education and core writing requirements vary according to a residential college system. Undergraduate housing is organized around a [[residential college|system of residential colleges]] modeled after those at the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Cambridge]], and somewhat similar to the systems at [[Princeton University]].  The colleges each have their own campuses, places of residence, and offices. Each college issues unique undergraduate diplomas and holds an individual commencement ceremony.

UC San Diego's six colleges are:
#[[Revelle College]], founded in 1964 as First College, has highly structured requirements.
#[[John Muir College]], founded in 1967 as Second College, emphasizes a "spirit of self-sufficiency and individual choice" and offers loosely structured general-education requirements.
#[[Thurgood Marshall College]], founded in 1970 as Third College, emphasizes "scholarship, social responsibility and the belief that a liberal arts education must include an understanding of [one's] role in society".
#[[Earl Warren College]], founded in 1974 as Fourth College, requires students to pursue a major of their choice while also requiring two "programs of concentration" in disciplines unrelated to each other and to their major "toward a life in balance".
#[[Eleanor Roosevelt College]], founded in 1988 as Fifth College, which focuses its core education program on a cross-cultural interdisciplinary course sequence entitled "Making of the Modern World".
#[[Sixth College]], founded in 2002 with a focus on  "historical and philosophical connections among culture, art and technology."

== Student life ==
[[File:Ucsdtriton.jpg|thumb|The statue of the UCSD Triton]]   [[Image:Price Center, UCSD.jpg|thumb|[[Price Center]]]]
The campus's undergraduate population is represented by a formal [[student government]], known as the [http://as.ucsd.edu Associated Students] (A.S.).  The Associated Students also funds three quarterly [[festival]]s during the year: FallFest, WinterFest, and Sun God. The [[Sun God Festival]], named after the [[Sun God (statue)|statue]] created by [[art]]ist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], is the best-known of the three festivals. During the event, there are day long series of concerts, performances, free items, and celebration before the final free concert takes place in the evening.

The main student hub is the [[Price Center]] located in the center of campus, just south of [[Geisel Library]]. The Price Center offers a variety of services, places, and spaces geared to the needs of students including restaurants, the central bookstore, movie theater, and various student organizations. In the Spring of 2003 a Student Referendum was passed to expand the Price Center to nearly double the original size. The [[Price Center]] East expansion was officially opened to the public on May 19, 2008. <ref>http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/thisweek/2008/05/19_pce-launch.asp</ref>

[[Image:Watermelon Drop UCSD.jpg|left|thumb|The June 2007 Watermelon Drop, an annual tradition at Revelle College]]
Two other popular campus events include the Pumpkin Drop and the Watermelon Drop, which take place during [[Halloween]] and at the end of the third (Spring) [[Academic quarter (year division)|academic quarter]], respectively. The Watermelon Drop is one of the campus's oldest traditions, famously originating in 1965 from a physics exam question centering on the velocity on impact of a dropped object. A group of intrigued students pursued that line of thought by dropping a watermelon from the top floor of Revelle's Urey Hall to measure the size of the resulting splat. A variety of events surround the Watermelon Drop, including a pageant where an occasionally male but generally female "Watermelon Queen" is elected.  In 1979 the Queen rode to Urey Hall in a theatrical-prop sedan chair that had been knocking around the Revelle dorms for years. The Pumpkin Drop is a similar event celebrated by the dropping of a large, candy-filled pumpkin from 11-story Tioga Hall, the tallest residential building on the Muir college campus.

Each of the undergraduate colleges focuses on enhancing student life through various programs and organizations as well as through residential life programs.  Upon admission to UC San Diego, each undergraduate student is assigned to a college.  Currently there are six colleges&mdash;Revelle, Muir, Marshall, Roosevelt, Warren, and Sixth College (not yet named).  The college a student is assigned to determines their General Education requirements.  Each college also has a unique college specific writing class that all students must take. Each college has its own college council ([[student council]]) as well.

The campus's graduate population is represented by a separate formal [[student government]], known as the [http://gsa.ucsd.edu Graduate Student Association] (GSA). The Association's membership comprises representatives from each of the graduate departments. The number of representatives is proportional to the number of graduate students within that particular department. Additionally, graduate students who serve as teaching or research assistants are represented by the UC-wide union of Academic Student Employees, [[UAW]] Local 2865.

There are also three campus centers that cultivate a sense of community among faculty, staff, and students: the [[multiculturalism|Cross-Cultural]] Center, the [[Gender|Women's Center]] and the [[LGBT]] Resource Center.  UC San Diego was the last UC campus to have such centers.  All three centers, especially the Cross-Cultural Center that was created first, were founded in the mid-1990s and were the result of student movements that demanded change despite opposition by the campus administration.<ref>http://ccc.ucsd.edu/About.asp</ref>

One of the more controversial aspects of student life at UCSD is the student-run comedy paper, [[The Koala]], a satirical paper often criticized for its provocative articles and drawings, which is also funded by the A.S.<ref>[http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/72.html FIRE - Student Humor Magazine Prosecuted for Parody at UCSD: University Decision Expected This Week<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2005, the student council made national news over a controversy regarding [[pornography]] broadcast over the A.S.-funded [[television]] station by members of [[The Koala]].

The campus newspaper, operated independent of student funds, is the [[UCSD Guardian]]. The campus also hosts a small independent radio station, [[KSDT Radio|KSDT]], which no longer broadcasts over the airwaves, but still operates online. There is a music venue on the campus grounds of some fame called The [[Che Cafe]], a collective organization serving multiple functions as an underground music venue, vegan food collective, center for grassroots organizations such as [[Food Not Bombs]], and similar groups and activities. Prominent local San Diego bands such as [[The Locust]] and [[Pinback]], and national tours such as [[Mates of State]] and [[Dillinger Escape Plan]] have given the [[Che Cafe]] some fame and praise as a radical vegan collective despite its small size (it fits a few hundred people) and limited sound equipment.

More than a dozen public art projects, part of the [[Stuart Collection]], decorate the campus. Perhaps the most famous of these is the [[Sun God (statue)|Sun God]], a large winged creature located near the Faculty Club. Other Stuart Collection art includes a collection of [[Stonehenge]]-like stone blocks, a large coiling snake path, a building that flashes the names of vices and virtues in bright neon lights, and three metallic [[Eucalyptus]] trees, the Music Tree, the Literary Tree and the Third Tree commonly referred to as the Silent Tree. One of the newest additions to the collection is Tim Hawkinson's giant teddy bear made of six boulders located in between the newly constructed [[Calit2]] buildings.<ref name= "Calit2"/> Another notable campus sight are the graffiti tunnels of Mandeville Hall, a series of corridors that have been tagged with [[graffiti]] by generations of students over decades of use. Students in the university's visual arts department also often create temporary public art installations as part of their coursework. The university is also sponsoring a $56,000 [[performance art]] project to develop a sense of community at the sprawling campus.<ref>

Until the 2007-2008 school year, UC San Diego was the only DII school that did not offer athletic [[scholarship]]s. In 2005, the NCAA created a rule that made it mandatory for DII programs to award athletic grants; a measure was proposed to begin offering $500 "grants-in-aid" to all 600 intercollegiate athletes in order to meet this requirement. In February 2007, a $78 fee [[referendum]] was passed in the largest vote in UC San Diego history. This fee increase put the UCSD athletic department budget on par with rival DII schools for the first time since the transition.<ref>
