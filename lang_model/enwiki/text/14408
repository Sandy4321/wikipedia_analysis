'''Yaonian Yanmujin''' (<U+9059><U+8F26><U+5DD6><U+6BCD><U+65A4>) or '''Xiao Yanmujin''' (<U+856D><U+5DD6><U+6BCD><U+65A4>) (died December 18, 933<ref name=HL3>''[[History of Liao]]'', [[:zh:s:<U+907C><U+53F2>/<U+5377>3|vol. 3]].</ref><ref name=AS>[http://sinocal.sinica.edu.tw/ [[Academia Sinica]] Chinese-Western Calendar Converter].</ref>), formally '''Empress Xuanjian''' (<U+5BA3><U+7C21><U+7687><U+540E>), was an [[empress dowager]] of the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]].  She was the mother of Liao's founder [[Emperor Taizu of Liao]] (Yel<U+00FC> Abaoji) and the wife of his father Yel<U+00FC> Saladi (<U+8036><U+5F8B><U+85A9><U+524C><U+7684>).  During the reign of Emperor Taizu's son [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Emperor Taizong]], she was grand empress dowager.

== Background and marriage to Yel<U+00FC> Saladi ==
It is not known when Yaonian Yanmujin was born.  (She is referred to in traditional historical sources (such as the ''[[History of Liao]]'') as Xiao Yanmujin because, according to the ''History of Liao'', [[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Emperor Taizu]] greatly admired [[Emperor Gao of Han]], and so referred to his own Yel<U+00FC> clan by the name of [[Liu]] as well, while he had the names of the traditional wife clans of Yel<U+00FC> chieftains <U+2014> the most prominent of whom included the Yishi (<U+4E59><U+5BA4>) and Bali (<U+62D4><U+88CF>) clans <U+2014> change their names to [[Xiao (surname)|Xiao]], and thus almost all Liao empresses, both actual and posthumously honored ones, were known by the surname of Xiao.)  Yaonian Yanmujin was of the Yaonian clan, and was a daughter of the chancellor Yaonian Tila (<U+9059><U+8F26><U+5254><U+524C>).<ref name=HL71>''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:<U+907C><U+53F2>/<U+5377>71|vol. 71]].</ref>

At some point, Yaonian Yanmujin married the Yel<U+00FC> chieftain Yel<U+00FC> Saladi.  She bore him six children <U+2014> five of his six sons, including his oldest son Yel<U+00FC> Abaoji, and one daughter.<ref name=HL71/><ref>''History of Liao'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a21/064.htm vol. 64].</ref>

== As empress dowager ==
After Yel<U+00FC> Abaoji succeeded Yel<U+00FC> Saladi as the Yel<U+00FC> chief, he conquered the other Khitan tribes by force, and by [[872]], he had declared himself the emperor of a new [[Liao Dynasty|Khitan Empire]] (which would later become known as Liao) as its Emperor Taizu.  He honored his mother Yaonian Yamujin as [[empress dowager]].<ref name=HL1>''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:<U+907C><U+53F2>/<U+5377>1|vol. 1]].</ref>  Still, despite her honored title, her daughter-in-law [[Empress Shul<U+00FC> Ping]], because of Empress Shul<U+00FC>'s own battlefield accomplishments, refused to bow to her (or Empress Shul<U+00FC>'s own mother) and instead made them bow to herself, stating, "I only bow to Heaven, not to humans."<ref>''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:<U+8CC7><U+6CBB><U+901A><U+9451>/<U+5377>269|vol. 269]].</ref>

In [[874]], while Emperor Taizu was away at Lu River (<U+8606><U+6C34>), he believed that there would be a joint rebellion by his brothers Yel<U+00FC> Diela (<U+8036><U+5F8B><U+8FED><U+524C> (whom he had made the King of the [[Kumo Xi|Xi]])) and Yel<U+00FC> Anduan (<U+8036><U+5F8B><U+5B89><U+7AEF>), and therefore arrested them.  When another brother, Yel<U+00FC> Lage (<U+8036><U+5F8B><U+524C><U+845B>) heard this, Yel<U+00FC> Lage then arrived at the Khitan headquarters with an army, apparently planning to declare himself emperor.  It was at Empress Dowager Yaonian's orders that he departed from the headquarters.  His army subsequently pillaged the headquarters but were repelled by Emperor Taizu's wife [[Empress Shul<U+00FC> Ping]]'s army, and they subsequently departed.<ref name=HL1/>

In [[875]], on an occasion when Emperor Taizu was attacking the Wugu Tribe (<U+70CF><U+53E4>), he heard that Empress Dowager Yaonian was ill, and therefore returned to headquarters to attend to her.  He resumed the Wugu campaign once she recovered.<ref name=HL2>''History of Liao'', [[:zh:s:<U+907C><U+53F2>/<U+5377>2|vol. 2]].</ref>

== As grand empress dowager ==
In [[927]], Emperor Taizu died and was succeeded by his son [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Yel<U+00FC> Deguang]] (as Emperor Taizong).  Emperor Taizong honored Empress Dowager Yaonian as grand empress dowager.  She died in 933.<ref name=HL3/>
