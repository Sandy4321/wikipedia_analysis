'''''Shrek''''', an [[Academy Award]] winning animated feature [[film]], by  DreamWorks Animation debuted in 2001, and is based upon [[William Steig]]'s [[1990]] [[fairy tale]] picture book entitled ''[[Shrek!]]'' It was directed by [[New Zealand]]er [[Andrew Adamson]] and Los Angeles artist [[Vicky Jenson]] and animated by [[DreamWorks Animation SKG]]. ''Shrek'' was the first film to win an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], a category introduced in 2001. It was released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] on [[November 7]] [[2001]].

The film features the voices of [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] as a large, strong, solitude-loving, grumpy [[ogre]] named [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (from the [[German language|German]] word "schreck" meaning "terror" or [[Yiddish]] word <U+05E9><U+05E8><U+05E2><U+05E7>, meaning "fear"), [[Cameron Diaz]] as the beautiful but very down-to-earth and feisty [[Princess Fiona]], [[Eddie Murphy]] as a talkative [[donkey]] named [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], and [[John Lithgow]] as the villainous [[Lord Farquaad]]. 

It was critically acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humor to appeal to children. It made notable use of pop music&mdash;the soundtrack includes music by [[Smash Mouth]], [[Joan Jett]], [[The Proclaimers]], [[Jason Wade]], [[The Baha Men]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].

The film was extremely successful on release in 2001 and it helped establish [[DreamWorks]] as a prime competitor to [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in the field of feature film animation, particularly in computer animation. Furthermore, Shrek was made the [[mascot]] for the company's animation productions.

This film is third on [[Bravo (television network)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies".{{Fact|date=December 2007}} ''Shrek'' was also ranked second in a Channel 4 poll of the 100 greatest family films, losing out on the top spot to ''[[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]''{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

==Plot==
The story begins with Shrek peaceably enjoying life within his home: a swamp. This is shattered when he inadvertently rescues the stubborn and talkative [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] (voice of [[Eddie Murphy]]) from soldiers sent by ruthless ruler of the Kingdom of Duloc, [[Lord Farquaad]] (voice of [[John Lithgow]]). Farquaad is obsessed with ruling a "perfect kingdom", without any fairy tale creatures, and uses the [[Snow White|Magic Mirror]] to select a princess bride he can marry in order to become a king. He chooses [[Princess Fiona]] (voice of [[Cameron Diaz]]), who is held captive in a castle surrounded by lava and guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. 

Much to Shrek's chagrin, Lord Farquaad has relocated all the fairy tale creatures to his swamp. Shrek and Donkey head off to the Kingdom of Duloc so they can complain to Farquaad and Shrek can get his swamp back. When Shrek and Donkey get to the Kingdom, they interrupt a tournament Farquaad is holding in order to select a knight worthy of rescuing Princess Fiona. Lord Farquaad then sends the knights to kill Shrek. Shrek fights the knights, with some help from Donkey, and defeats them. Lord Farquaad, getting an idea, proclaims Shrek the winner of the tournament and agrees to remove the fairy tale creatures from the swamp if Shrek rescues Fiona.

When they get to the castle Shrek and Donkey split up to search for Fiona. As Shrek, after putting on the helmet of a fallen knight finds the princess, Donkey runs into the fire-breathing dragon, which he gets cornered by, and begins to give compliments to her to stop her from killing him. Dragon takes these compliments seriously and she subsequently takes Donkey away to her chambers.

After escaping, Fiona orders Shrek to remove his helmet so they can share true love's first kiss. Shrek refuses her request at first, but then shows her his true face. Upon realizing that he is an ogre and not her true love, she angrily refuses to go with Shrek back to Duloc so Shrek takes Fiona by force instead, picking her up and throwing her over his shoulder. The three set off back to Duloc.

On their way through the woods, Fiona insists that they should stop and make camp as sunset comes. Fiona sleeps in a little rock cave while Shrek and Donkey talk under the stars.

The next night, Shrek and Fiona are about to kiss when Donkey reminds them of the sun setting. Surprised, Fiona rushes into the old windmill near which they are camping. Donkey now thinks that Shrek and Fiona are beginning a romantic liking towards one another, to which Shrek realises that he and Fiona could never be and storms off.

Donkey enters the windmill, but finds an ogress instead of Fiona. He instantly starts screaming and yelling, until he realizes that the ogress ''is'' Princess Fiona. She then explains that she was cursed by an enchantment: human by day, ogress by night, until she receives her true love's kiss and takes "love's true form". Donkey brings up Shrek's name, saying that the two of them have a lot in common. Meanwhile, Shrek is outside the door waiting to tell Fiona how he feels about her, but overhears the conversation between Donkey and Fiona, thinking that Fiona is calling him a horrible monster. Shrek leaves, angry and heartbroken, without listening to the rest of the exchange: Fiona requests Donkey not to reveal the secret to anyone. Before Fiona has the chance to tell Shrek, the sun rises, turning Fiona into her human form. Fiona tries to tell him, but he is too angry about what he heard last night. As she still does not understand why he was upset about it, Shrek repeats what she said, "who could love a beast so hideous?" Unfortunately, Fiona misunderstands this as Shrek saying even ''he'' thinks she was hideous. Farquaad and his knights then simultaneously appear to escort Fiona back to Duloc, which Fiona gladly accepts. Farquaad gives Shrek his deed to his swamp and he begins to head off. Farquaad takes Fiona back to Duloc and begins the preparations for the marriage, while Donkey rushes to Shrek, telling him to stop Farquaad from taking Fiona. Shrek refuses to listen to him and sets off for his swamp, leaving an upset Donkey behind him.

Shrek goes home to return to his normal life. Donkey returns to Shrek's swamp to make up for being annoying to Shrek and tells him that Fiona was talking about somebody else rather than him. Shrek wants to end the wedding before it is too late, but would not be able to make it in time. Donkey then whistles and Dragon appears offering to take them. Upon arriving, Shrek storms in and objects to the wedding. 

Shrek tells Fiona that Farquaad only wants to marry her so that he can be king and that he is not her true love. Farquaad then realizes that Shrek has fallen in love with the princess. He and the rest of the citizens begin to laugh before he reminds Fiona that they are one kiss away from their happily ever after. Fiona then shows Shrek her ogre form. Farquaad, disgusted, orders his knights to kill Shrek and lock Fiona back in her tower. Shrek whistles and Dragon smashes through a stained glass window and swallows Farquaad. Shrek tells Fiona that he truly loves her and they share a kiss that turns Fiona into an ogress all the time. She is initially confused, as she was expecting to become beautiful permanently, but Shrek assures her that she ''is'' beautiful, in the ogrish way.

At the end, the two get married and set off on their honeymoon in an onion carriage.

==Production== 
[[Robin Williams]], who had worked for Katzenberg before in ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'' and had had a bitter falling out with him and [[The Walt Disney Company]] after going back on the deal they had (which can be explained in the ''Aladdin'' page), has hinted in an interview that he has refused a role in this film, because it would mean working for Jeffrey Katzenberg again. He would not state which role he refused<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000245/news Robin Williams (I) - News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

[[Chris Farley]] was originally going to do the voice for Shrek and did at least half of the audio for the voice, but died before the project was completed. Dreamworks then re-cast the voice role to [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]]. After Myers had completed providing the voice for the character and the movie was well into production, he asked to be allowed to ''re-''record all of his lines in a [[Scottish English#Phonology|Scottish accent]] similar to the one his mother had used when she told him bedtime stories. Myers had also employed this character voicing for a skit during his ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' tenure, and also for the character Stuart MacKenzie in the motion picture ''[[So I Married an Axe Murderer]]'' and [[Fat Bastard]] in ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]].''

Donkey was modeled after Pericles, a real miniature donkey from Barron Park, [[Palo Alto, California]].<ref>http://www.rosettastoneinc.com/california/donkeys/index.html</ref>
