<!-- Walter Francis O'Malley (1903-1979)--> 
<!-- Social Security Number 090249001 -->
'''Walter Francis O'Malley''' ([[October 9]], [[1903]] &ndash; [[August 9]], [[1979]]) was an [[United States|American]] sports executive who owned the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers]] team in [[Major League Baseball]] from {{by|1950}} to {{by|1979}}.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Walter O'Malley |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9057075/Walter-OMalley |quote=Walter Francis O'Malley, American lawyer who was the principal owner of the National League Brooklyn Dodgers professional baseball team (from 1958 the Los Angeles Dodgers). As owner of the Dodgers, he played a role in two of the key events in the history of both the club and the major leagues: Jackie Robinson's breaking of the colour barrier in {{by|1947}} and the expansion of the major leagues to the West Coast. |publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] |date= |accessdate=2007-09-25 }}</ref> In 1958 he brought major league baseball to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], moving the Dodgers from [[Brooklyn]] to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=WO/><ref name=move/> 

O'Malley<U+2019>s Irish father was politically connected and O<U+2019>Malley was well-educated.  O'Malley, who was born and raised in {{city-state|New York|New York}}, leveraged the combination of his family connections, his personal contacts, and both his educational and vocational skills to rise to prominence.  First, he became an [[entrepreneur]] involved in [[public works]] contracting and then he became an executive with the Dodgers.  He progressed from team [[lawyer]] to team owner and president, and he eventually made the business decision to relocate the Dodger franchise.  He eventually passed control of the team to his son.

==Early years==
Walter O'Malley was the only child of [[Edwin O'Malley|Edwin Joseph O'Malley]] (1883-1955), who worked as a [[cotton]] goods [[salesman]] in the [[Bronx]] in 1903. Edwin O<U+2019>Malley would later become the [[Commissioner of Public Markets]] for [[New York City]]. Walter's mother was Alma Feltner (1882-1940).<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Walter in Wonderland |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868429,00.html |quote=The man with the ample jowls swiveled happily in his seat. Cigar ash dribbled over his shirt front, and his several chins bobbled as his tight little mouth widened into a smile. Everywhere he looked he saw money. There in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were 78,672 paying customers for the first home game of the Los Angeles Dodgers; no larger crowd had ever watched a single regular-season baseball game anywhere. So far as the Dodgers' President Walter Francis O'Malley was concerned, his team had already conquered Southern California. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)]] |date= |accessdate=2007-02-14 }}</ref>

O'Malley attended the [[Jamaica High School (New York City)|Jamaica High School]] in [[Queens]] and then the [[Culver Academies|Culver Academy]] in [[Indiana]].<ref name=nytobit/> Then, he attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and graduated in 1926. O<U+2019>Malley originally enrolled at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], but after his family lost their money in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], he switched to night school at [[Fordham University]]. He completed his [[Juris doctor|law degree]] in 1930 at [[Fordham University School of Law|Fordham Law]], and then worked as an assistant engineer for the [[New York City Subway]]. He then worked for Thomas F. Riley who owned the Riley Drilling Company, and they formed the partnership of Riley and O'Malley. With the help of Walter's father's political connections, the company received contracts from the [[New York Telephone Company]] and the [[New York City Board of Education]] to perform [[geological survey]]s. Subsequently, Walter started the Walter F. O'Malley Engineering Company and published the ''[[Subcontractors Register]]'' with his uncle, Joseph O'Malley (1893-1985).<ref name=WO/>

On [[September 5]], [[1931]], he married Katherine Elizabeth Hanson (1907-1979), whom he had dated since high school, at [[Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Manhattan]]. They had two children: Theresa O'Malley Seidler (1933- )<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Daughter to Mrs. W.F.

Ed O<U+2019>Malley was the third oldest, became a dry goods merchant and later was appointed the New York City Commissioner of Public Markets. Walter was a baseball fan of the New York Giants as a youngster, frequenting the old Polo Grounds with his uncle Clarence Feltner. | accessdate=2007-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Kay O'Malley, 72, Wife of Dodgers Owner, Dies |url= |quote=Kay O'Malley, wife of board chairman Walter F.

==Dodgers==
In 1933, Walter met [[George V. McLaughlin]], president of the Brooklyn Trust Company. It was through George that Walter was brought into the financial arrangements for [[Ebbets Field]] in 1940.<ref name=WO/>  In 1942, he was appointed the attorney for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and he became the president and chief stockholder ([[owner]]) on [[October 26]], [[1950 in sports|1950]].  O<U+2019>Malley assumed the title of president from [[Branch Rickey]], who is considered a trailblazer in baseball both for instituting the [[minor league baseball|farm system]] and for breaking the racial barrier with [[Jackie Robinson]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=O'Malley Elected To Succeed Rickey As Dodger President. Rickey Congratulates His Successor.  |url= |quote=Branch Rickey, baseball's 69 year-old wizard, "resigned" the presidency of the Brooklyn Dodgers yesterday and Walter F. O'Malley, 47-year-old Brooklyn lawyer, was elected to succeed him. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=[[October 27]], [[1950]] |accessdate=2007-02-14 }}</ref>

After the ownership transfer, the Dodgers remained successful under O'Malley: they won the National League pennants in {{by|1952}}, {{by|1953}}, {{by|1955}}, and {{by|1956}}.  In [[1955 in sports|1955]], the team won the [[World Series]] for the first time in their history.  Attendance declined from a peak of 1.7 million in {{by|1946}} and {{by|1947}} to just over one-million per year in the mid 1950s.  O'Malley tried to raise money and get the political backing to build a [[Brooklyn Dodgers proposed domed stadium|new ballpark]] elsewhere in Brooklyn. The one person whose backing he needed was [[Robert Moses]]. Moses influenced development in New York through the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]]. O'Malley had wanted to build a new Brooklyn Dodger stadium at [[Flatbush Avenue (Brooklyn)|Flatbush]] and [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]], but Moses  wanted the Dodgers to move to Queens and play in [[Flushing Meadows Park]], which is the [[stadium]] where the [[New York Mets]] play today. Ultimately, O'Malley decided to leave Brooklyn for Los Angeles.<ref name=WO/><ref name=move>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Baseball Club Holds Edge in Chavez Ravine Test. |url= |quote=The proposal to give the Dodgers a 300-acre baseball stadium site in Chavez Ravine appeared to be winning in Los Angeles' municipal election tonight. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=[[June 4]], [[1958]], Wednesday |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Dodgers Settle Down at Last in Chavez Ravine |url= |quote=[[Los Angeles]], [[April 9]], [[1962]] ([[United Press International]]) Eager citizens, proud civic leaders and jubilant baseball dignitaries today joined to dedicate the Los Angeles Dodgers' new multimillion-dollar 56,000-seat stadium in Chavez Ravine. |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=[[April 10]], [[1962]], Tuesday |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref>

===Move to Los Angeles===
Following the [[1957 in baseball|1957 Major League Baseball season]]<!--Switch link to [[1957 Major League Baseball season]] when available-->, he moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles. Also, he was influential in getting the rival [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] to move west to become the San Francisco Giants. He needed another team to go with him, for had he moved out west alone, The [[St. Louis Cardinals]] - {{convert|1600|mi|km|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} away -<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aatimetable.com/aa.pdf|title=Worldwide Timetable|publisher=American Airlines|accessdate=2007-11-24|date=[[2007-11-01]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcome.warnercnr.colostate.edu/class_info/nr502/lg1/map_projections/latitude_longitude.html|title=Identifying Locations|publisher=colostate.edu|accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref> would have been the closest National League team if the Giants had not also moved west. O'Malley met with Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] - who was considering moving the Giants to Minnesota - and convinced Stoneham to join him on the west coast at the end of the '57 campaign. The moves broke the hearts of New York's fans but ultimately were successful for both franchises - and for Major League Baseball as a whole. In the years following the move of the New York clubs, Major League Baseball expanded to include three other California based teams, two in Texas, Minnesota, Colorado, Arizona and Seattle. O'Malley was given {{convert|352|acre|sqkm|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} in [[Chavez Ravine]] by the Los Angeles city government and built the 56,000 capacity [[Dodger Stadium]] for [[U.S. Dollar|$]]12 million. The Dodgers temporarily took up residence in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], while they awaited the completion of Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers were soon drawing more than two-million fans a year.  They remained successful on the field as well, winning the World Series in [[1959 World Series|1959]], [[1963 World Series|1963]], and [[1965 World Series|1965]]. The [[Los Angeles Angels]] also played in [[Dodger Stadium]] from 1962 to 1965.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mayor Is Blamed For Dodger Move; City Administration Scored By G.O.P.

===Retire from presidency===
On [[March 17]], [[1970 in sports|1970]], Walter turned over the presidency of the team to his son Peter, remaining as Chairman until his death in 1979. [[Peter O'Malley]] held the position until 1998 when the team was sold to [[Rupert Murdoch]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Peter O'Malley, 30-year old son of the president, Walter F.

Forty years after his father removed the family business to L.A. from [[Brooklyn]], [[Peter O'Malley]] announced that he was selling the firm -- namely, the Dodgers. By transplanting the beloved Bums to California in 1958, the unsentimental Walter O'Malley had ushered the era of Big Business into baseball; last week Peter claimed that the current game's corporate-scale economics were forcing him to sell. Something about the sins of the father leaped to the minds of people whose hearts are still in Brooklyn. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)]] |date=Monday, [[January 20]], [[1997]]   |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref>

==Death==
Walter O'Malley was diagnosed with [[cancer]], and he sought treatment at the [[Mayo Clinic]] in {{city-state|Rochester|Minnesota}}. He died of [[congestive heart failure]] on [[August 9]], [[1979]] and was buried at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Walter F.

Despite the long-standing animosity of Brooklyn fans and their supporters in baseball, O'Malley was posthumously [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|elected]] to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] on [[December 3]] [[2007]] by the minimal number of "yea" votes necessary for acceptance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071203&content_id=2315876&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|accessdate=2007-12-08|title=O'Malley family rejoices in Hall election|date=[[2007-12-03]]|publisher=MLB Advanced Media, L.P. |author=Gurnick, Ken}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
O'Malley was mentioned several times in [[Danny Kaye]]'s 1962 song tribute, "The D-O-D-G-E-R-S Song (Oh, Really? No, O'Malley!)," which spins a tale of a fantasy game between the Dodgers and the Giants. At one point, the [[umpire]]'s call goes against the home team:
:''Down in the dugout, [[Walter Alston|Alston]] glowers''
:''Up in the booth, [[Vin Scully]] frowns;''
:''Out in the stands, O'Malley grins...''
:''Attendance 50,000!''
:''So ....what does O'Malley do? CHARGE!!

Just before the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] began a series of games against the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium, in [[1963 in baseball|1963]], the [[Los Angeles Times]] published a large cartoon, drawn by artist [[Pete Bentovoja]], modeled on the movies about the [[Germany|German]] [[submarine]] captain. The captain is Cards' manager [[Johnny Keane]]; his "lieutenant" is [[Stan Musial]]. They wear Cardinal uniforms with naval officers' caps bearing the "St.L" emblem. While Keane and Musial are speaking, other crew members load bats, like [[torpedoes]], into torpedo tubes; the bats have players' faces (and names and batting averages) drawn on them. Keane looks through the [[periscope]]; the [[inset]] shows a [[battleship]] with a large head of O'Malley, wearing a naval officers cap bearing the "LA" emblem and puffing a cigar.
Keane: "Achtung Shtan [Stan]! I zought ve sunk sem last year?"
Musial: "Yavohl, Mein Kommander, Ve vill blast zem vit bigger und better torpedoes zis zeazon!" (The Cards made a terrific drive for the pennant but finished the season six games back of the Dodgers.)

O'Malley was featured prominently in the [[HBO]] [[documentary film]], ''[[Ghosts of Flatbush]]'', which Chronicled his executive management of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers,.
