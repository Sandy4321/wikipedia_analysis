'''Super Typhoon Nancy''' (international designation: '''''6118''''') was a powerful [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1961 Pacific typhoon season]]. The system with possibly the strongest winds ever measured in a tropical cyclone, Nancy caused extensive damage and at least 173 deaths and thousands of injuries in [[Japan]] and elsewhere in September 1961. The destruction was so heavy that the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] gave the typhoon its own special name, one of only eight systems to have been named.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Nancy 1961 track.png}}
A tropical depression formed from a [[low pressure area|low]] near [[Kwajalein Atoll]] on September 7. It strengthened rapidly; by the time position fixes could be taken, Nancy was nearly a super typhoon. Moving gradually westward, Nancy explosively deepened and reached wind speeds equivalent to a Category&nbsp;5 ([[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]) on September 9.<ref name="Unisys Data">[http://www.weather.unisys.com/hurricane/w_pacific/1961/18/track.dat Unisys Tracking Data] accessed March 7, 2006</ref> It would maintain that intensity for the next several days.

Shortly after reaching peak intensity, Nancy approached the [[Ryukyu Islands|Ry<U+016B>ky<U+016B> Islands]] and began turning. It passed near [[Okinawa]] and over [[Haze (island)|Haze]]. The [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] steering Nancy broke down, and the typhoon turned sharply and headed towards Japan. Nancy made landfall as a strong typhoon on September 16 as it passed directly over [[Muroto Zaki]]. Nancy made a second landfall on [[Honsh<U+016B>]] near [[Osaka]]. The [[tropical cyclone|typhoon]] rapidly traveled up the length of the island as it continued accelerating, eventually reaching a forward speed of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h, 55&nbsp;[[knot (speed)|knots]]).<ref name=JTWC>[http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1961atcr/pdf/wnp/52.pdf JTWC Nancy Report] accessed March 7, 2006</ref> The typhoon quickly crossed over [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] before entering the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] as a tropical storm. Nancy went [[extratropical]] on September 17. The extratropical system eventually crossed over [[Kamchatka]] and entered the open ocean.<ref name="Typhoon List View">[http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/search_name2.pl?name=NANCY%&lang=en Digital Typhoon: Typhoon list View] accessed March 7, 2006</ref>

==Impact==
Although no monetary value of all damage is known, damage was "phenomenal"<ref name=JTWC/> in all areas where Nancy hit. There were at least 173 deaths and 19 people unaccounted for.

===Guam===
On [[Guam]], over half of all crops were destroyed by heavy winds and rain. A total of $40,000 (1961 [[United States Dollar|USD]]) worth of damage was done to roads on the island. Most of the damage was on the southern end of the island. No deaths were reported on Guam.<ref name=JTWC/>

===Minor Japanese islands===
{{Significant Typhoons with Special Names|align=right}}

On [[Okinawa]], low-lying areas experienced heavy flooding, which did significant damage to agriculture and structures. No one was killed on Okinawa.<ref name=JTWC/>

On [[Amami-o-Shima]], one person was missing and another was badly injured. A ship was sunk. Extensive flooding of crops and houses left 152 people homeless.<ref name=JTWC/>

===Japan===
In Japan, 172 persons were killed, 18 were missing, and 3,184 people were injured. These totals made Nancy the sixth-deadliest typhoon to hit Japan at the time. Timely warnings and adequate preparations were probably responsible for the relatively low death toll. The damage was "small" relative to other typhoons that impacted densely-populated areas of Japan.<ref name=JTWC/>

Hundreds of thousands of people had their lives disrupted. Super typhoon Nancy destroyed 11,539 houses, damaged 32,604 homes, and flooded 280,078 others. Although the exact number may never be known, the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' reported in late September that over 1,056 ships and fishing vessels were sunk or blown ashore and many more were damaged.<ref name=JTWC/>

Floodwaters washed away 566 [[bridge (structure)|bridges]] and caused 1146 [[landslide]]s. Roads were destroyed at a total of 2,053 locations.<ref name=JTWC/> Damages in [[Osaka]] amounted to $500&nbsp;million (1961&nbsp;USD).<ref>David Longshore ''Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones'' pg. 233</ref>

Due to Nancy's damage and death toll, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] named Nancy the "Second [[Muroto]] Typhoon". Nancy is one of only eight typhoons to receive special names in Japan.

===Lack of retirement===
Nancy's name was not retired after this typhoon. As a consequence, the name was used again in [[1966 Pacific typhoon season|1966]] and several times thereafter until [[1989 Pacific typhoon season|1989]].<ref name="Typhoon List View"/>

==Records==
A reconnaissance aircraft flying into the typhoon near its peak intensity on September 12 determined Nancy's one-minute [[sustained wind]]s to be 185&nbsp;knots (215&nbsp;mph; 345&nbsp;km/h). If these values are reliable, they would be the highest wind speeds ever measured in a tropical cyclone.<ref name=FAQ1>[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E1.html NOAA Tropical Cyclone FAQ Subject E1] accessed March 7, 2006</ref> However, it was later determined that measurements and estimations of wind speeds from the 1940s to 1960s were excessive. Thus, Nancy's winds may actually be lower than its official best-track value.<ref name=FAQ1/> If Nancy did indeed have 215&nbsp;mph winds, it would have had the fastest sustained windspeeds of any tropical cyclone by 25&nbsp;mph. [[Typhoon Tip]], [[1997 Pacific typhoon season#Super Typhoon Keith|Typhoon Keith]], [[Hurricane Allen]], [[Hurricane Camille]], [[Typhoon Vera (1959)|Typhoon Vera]], and [[1959 Pacific typhoon season|Typhoon Sarah]] all had winds of 190&nbsp;mph, the highest verified tropical cyclone windspeed.

Although the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale]] did not exist at the time, Nancy would have been a Category&nbsp;5 equivalent for a total of five and a half days (or 132 hours). This is a record for the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and more than a day longer than the next-highest system, [[Typhoon Karen|1962's Karen]].<ref name=FAQ2>[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E8.html NOAA Tropical Cyclone FAQ Subject E8] accessed March 7, 2006</ref>
