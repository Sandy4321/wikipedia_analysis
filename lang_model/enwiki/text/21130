'''New York State Route 198''', better known as the '''Scajaquada Expressway''', is an United States highway entirely within the northern section of the City of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] that carries over 31,000 cars per day.<ref>[http://www.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-respository/erietvbk.pdf NYSDOT Traffic Counts - Erie County]</ref> It takes its name from [[Scajaquada Creek]], which it parallels.

It connects the Kensington Expressway ([[New York State Route 33|NY 33]]) on Buffalo's east side with the Niagara Section of the [[New York State Thruway]], [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] in the [[Black Rock, New York|Black Rock]] neighborhood. It was constructed in the place of the former Scajaquada and Humboldt Parkways and bisects [[Delaware Park]].

New York State Route 198 is currently slated to be downgraded to a pedestrian-friendly roadway that is more in harmony with the surrounding communities.<ref>[http://www.ci.buffalo.ny.us/Home/NewsCalendar/Scajaquada_Corridor_Study Scajaquada Corridor Study]</ref>

==Route description==
NY 198, as well as the Scajaquada Expressway, begins at an [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with I-190 on the bank of the [[Niagara River]] northwest of downtown Buffalo. The route heads to the northeast initially, interchanging with [[New York State Route 265]] and [[New York State Route 266]] a meager distance east of I-190. At the Grant Street exit, NY 198 turns eastward, running along the northern edge of the [[Buffalo State College]] campus to an exit with Elmwood Avenue, which lines the eastern edge of the college.

Immediately after passing over Elmwood Avenue, NY 198 enters [[Delaware Park]]. In the western third of the park, a pair of on-ramps from Lincoln Parkway, which is separated into two segments by the park, merge with the expressway. It is not possible to travel directly from one segment to the other, however.

To the east of the parkway is an interchange with [[New York State Route 384]], Delaware Avenue, located entirely within the park. East of the interchange, NY 198 turns to the southeast for the first time as it circumvents the [[Forest Lawn Cemetery]] and proceeds to the only [[at-grade intersection]] on the Scajaquada with Parkside Avenue.

Directly southeast of Parkside Avenue, NY 198 reverts to a [[limited-access highway]] as it interchanges with [[New York State Route 5]], Main Street, before arriving at its eastern terminus at [[New York State Route 33]], which is the limited-access [[Kensington Expressway]] in this area of Buffalo. Between Parkside Avenue and NY 33, a pair of [[frontage road]]s parallel NY 198.

The highway runs past several of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]'s best-known [[landmark]]s such as [[Medaille College]], Delaware Park, the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo State College]] and the Buffalo Historical Society Museum, the only structure still standing specifically built for the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in 1901.
