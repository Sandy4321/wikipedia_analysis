"'''200'''"  is the sixth episode of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''{{'}}s [[Stargate SG-1 (season 10)|tenth season]], and the two-hundredth episode of the series overall. It is the first time original SG-1 member [[Jack O'Neill]] ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]) had been seen since the beginning of Season 9 in the episode {{sgcite|Origin}}. The episode won the 2007 Constellation Award for ''Best Overall 2006 Science Fiction Film or Television Script'',<ref name=constellation>{{cite web|url=http://constellations.tcon.ca/w.shtml/#C8|title=Constellation Awards 2007 Winners|publisher=constellations.tcon.ca|accessdate=2007-12-20|archiveurl=http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:sZe_4skFABUJ:constellations.tcon.ca/+constellation+award+2007+200&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=3&gl=us&client=safari |archivedate=2008-01-20}}<!--{{cite web|url=http://constellations.tcon.ca/w.shtml/#C8|title=Constellation Awards 2007 Winners|publisher=constellations.tcon.ca|accessdate=2007-12-20}}--></ref> and was nominated for the 2007 [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form|Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]].<ref name=hugo>{{cite web|url=http://www.nippon2007.us/hugo_nominees.php|title=Nippon 2007 Hugo Nominees|publisher=nippon2007.us|accessdate=2007-12-26}}</ref>

Unlike the more serious nature of the season's story arc, "200" is a light-hearted [[parody]] of both ''Stargate SG-1'' and other [[science fiction|sci-fi]] shows, as well as pop culture like ''[[The Wizard of Oz (movie)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  The episode received a 1.9 average household rating, one of the few episodes of the season that surpassed the average rating of ''Stargate SG-1''{{'}}s [[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)|previous season]].<ref name=boost>{{cite web|author=Sumner, Darren|date=2006-08-21|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2006/08/200_ratings_give_istargatei_need.shtml|title='200' ratings give Stargate needed boost|publisher=[[GateWorld]]|accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref> "200" also received near-universal praise for its humor and writing. Despite the strong performance of the episode, the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|SCI FI Channel]] announced soon after the episode's airing it would not be renewing the series for another season.<ref name=cancel/>

==Plot==
Martin Lloyd ([[Willie Garson]]), an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] turned writer, returns to [[Stargate Command]] looking for assistance from [[SG-1]] with his script for the movie adaptation of the television show ''Wormhole X-Treme'',<ref name="spacey">{{cite web|author=O'Hare, Kate|date=2006-08-17|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-stargatesg1at200,0,2235149.story|title='Stargate SG-1' Gets Spacey at 200|publisher=Zap2It|accessdate=2007-12-26}}</ref> mentioned earlier in the series during {{sgcite|Wormhole X-Treme!}}. The team is reluctant, especially [[Cameron Mitchell (Stargate)|Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell]] ([[Ben Browder]]), who is excited about his next off-world mission; the upcoming trip marks his 200th trip through the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]. However, when technical glitches prevent the team from setting off on their mission, they are stuck in the briefing room under the orders of [[Hank Landry (Stargate)|General Landry]] ([[Beau Bridges]]), because the Pentagon believes a successful science fiction film about intergalactic wormhole travel will serve as a [[disinformation|good cover story]] to keep the real Stargate program a secret.

However, the notes session quickly devolves into the team members pitching their own versions of a successful sci-fi film, including a [[zombie]] invasion (from Mitchell), a previously unseen mission where O'Neill became invisible (from [[Samantha Carter|Carter]]), "tributes" to ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' (from [[Vala Mal Doran|Vala]]), and [[Teal'c]] as a private investigator (from Teal'c himself). Also featured are a vignette of the team's mental image of a "younger and edgier" SG-1 (sparked by the studio's suggestion to replace the original ''Wormhole X-Treme'' cast), a suggested scene by Martin that turns out to be both scientifically inaccurate and highly derivative of ''[[Star Trek]]'', a re-imagined version of the [[Stargate (film)|original movie]] where all the characters are marionettes in the style of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', and an imagined wedding that features the return of [[Jack O'Neill|General Jack O'Neill]] ([[Richard Dean Anderson]]).

Ultimately, the planning session is all for naught, as the studio decides to cancel the movie in favor of renewing the series. At the end of the episode, the focus shifts ten years into the future, where the ''Wormhole X-Treme'' cast and crew are celebrating their 200th episode, as well as renewed plans for a movie.

==Production==
[[Executive producer]] [[Robert C. Cooper]] noted that despite the markedly different content of the episode, "200" took no longer to shoot &ndash; mainly because much of the filming took place on the briefing room set.<ref name="chicago"/> On the other hand, the episode was much more expensive than a typical one, due to the unusual sequences. For example, the [[marionette]]s used in an elaborate spoof of the series were created by Chiodo Bros, who also made the puppets for ''[[Team America: World Police]]''; each puppet cost about US$25,000, and the wires pulling each puppet had to be readded by [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in post production as they didn't show up well enough.<ref name=ac_mw/> Several existing sets were used as stand-ins; for example, the bridge of the ''[[Daedalus class battlecruiser|Odyssey]]'' was used for a ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' spoof, while a set from the sister production ''[[Stargate: Atlantis]]'' was used as the chamber of [[Wizard (Oz)|the Wizard of Oz]].<ref name=ac_mw />

In an interview about the tenth season of ''Stargate'', Cooper and Brad Wright stated that there was a fine line between the humor of regular episodes turning into [[Camp (style)|camp]]. While jokes for the joke's sake are usually limited in normal episodes, the line between humor and camp is deliberately crossed frequently in "200". The producers even talked about recreating a part of ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' that breaks the [[fourth wall]], but they could not afford the horses.<ref>{{cite news|last=McNamara |first=Mary |date=2006-08-16|title=Commanders in Chief- Anatomy of a Hit: Stargate SG-1|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|page=1 |url=http://www.multichannel.com/blog/1300000330/post/880011088.html}}</ref>

The producers made sure that the episode was well-publicized, dropping hints that Richard Dean Anderson's character O'Neill would return for the episode.<ref name=ac_mw /> Joe Mallozzi, executive producer for the series, also hinted that series fans would finally meet the [[Furling (Stargate)|Furlings]], an enigmatic race referenced in the second season episode {{sgcite|The Fifth Race}} but never seen.<ref name=ac_mw>{{cite video |people=[[Martin Wood|Wood, Martin]] |date=2006 |title= Audio Commentary for "200"|url= |format= |medium= DVD|publisher= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mallozzi, Joe |date=2005-12-22|url=http://forum.gateworld.net/showthread.php?p=4764548#post4764548|title=Ask Joe Mallozzi|publisher=[[GateWorld]]|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> Despite the outlandish scenes filmed for the episode, many of the writers' favorite moments did not make it to production due to time constraints; Cooper noted that a ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' skit was cut from the script.<ref name=ac_rcc_bw />

==Cultural references==
Most of the episode is devoted to references and allusions to other works, including the show itself. The title sequence is deliberately shorter than most other episodes, poking fun at shows like ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' as well as the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|SCI FI Channel]] itself,<ref name=ac_rcc_bw>{{cite video |people=[[Robert C. Cooper|Cooper, Robert C.]], [[Brad Wright|Wright, Brad]] |date=2006 |title= Audio Commentary for "200"|url= |format= |medium= DVD|publisher= }}</ref> which had shortened SG-1's Season 9 opening but changed it back after fan response.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2005/09/sci_fi_to_reinstate_full-length_.shtml |title=SCI FI to reinstate full-length openings |date=2005-09-01 |author=Sumner, Darren|publisher=[[GateWorld]] |accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref> When Lloyd learns that his main actor has backed out of the movie, the SG-1 team offers various suggestions about how to replace him or work around the lack of the actor, referencing [[Richard Dean Anderson]]'s lack of appearances in the eighth season of ''Stargate SG-1''.<ref name=ac_rcc_bw /> Anderson himself also pokes fun at the ending of the eighth season's {{sgcite|Moebius}}, which was intended to be the series finale before the ninth season was announced.<ref name=ac_mw /> The final scene, which features interviews with the ''Wormhole X-Treme'' cast, was added as an afterthought,<ref name=ac_mw /> and contains comments of the real cast which were taken out of context as an inside joke.<ref name=ac_mw />

[[File:SG1-10x06 star trek spoof.png|thumb|The SG-1 team as the ''[[Star Trek]]'' Crew]]
The episode also riffs on other science fiction shows. Early in the episode, Dr. Jackson asks who would make a movie out of a series that only lasted three episodes, to which Teal'c replies that it had strong [[DVD]] sales. This is a reference to the series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/news/sfw_news_20060403.html |title=SG-1 Winks At Serenity |author=Szymanski, Mike|date=2006-04-03|publisher=SciFi Weekly |accessdate=2007-07-11| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070101154552/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/news/sfw_news_20060403.html| archivedate = January 1, 2007}}</ref> which was cancelled after airing only fourteen episodes, but whose high DVD sales allowed the creation of the feature film ''[[Serenity (film)|Serenity]]''. <!-- ''Firefly'' is again referenced when Lloyd refuses to use footage from the ''Wormhole X-Treme'' series for the movie, saying that "it's a movie, not a clip show"; [[Joss Whedon]] insisted that the movie would not use footage from the original series as it is "not a [[clip show]]". --> One sequence is a parody of the original ''Star Trek'' series, with SG-1 standing in for the crew of the ''[[Enterprise (Star Trek)|Enterprise]]''.<ref name=ac_rcc_bw /> [[Brad Wright]], the co-creator of the series, fills in as the engineer [[Montgomery Scott]].<ref name=ac_mw /> The episode also takes the series ''[[Farscape]]'' to task, including its habit of inventing [[profanity|swear words]].<ref name=ac_rcc_bw /> Several other shows and movies are parodied, including telling the story of the ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' with the SG-1 team &ndash; the writers based the scene on a fan painting they had hanging in their office.<ref name=ac_rcc_bw /> Other elements make fun of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'''s "ticking clock of jeopardy",<ref name=ac_rcc_bw /> and an entire sequence with all the characters played by [[marionette]]s, in the style of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' and ''[[Team America: World Police]]''.

==Reception==
The episode won the 2007 Constellation Award for ''Best Overall 2006 Science Fiction Film or Television Script'',<ref name=constellation/> and was nominated for the 2007 [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form|Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]].<ref name=hugo/> [[Richard Dean Anderson]] also won a [[SyFy Genre Awards|SyFy Genre Award]] for his guest appearance in the episode.

The episode was generally well-received.

The highly publicized debut of the episode garnered a 1.9 average household rating, a 36% jump from the previous episode, and the first episode of the tenth season to reach or exceed the previous season's rating of 1.8;<ref name=boost/> ''Stargate SG-1'' at that point was averaging about 3.3 million viewers per regular episode in the United States.<ref name=milestone>{{cite web|author=McNamara, Mary|date=2006-05-08|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html|title=Science-Fiction Series 'SG-1' Is Cable's First to Reach Historic Milestone|publisher=multichannel.com|accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref>

===Cancellation===
Shortly after this episode was aired, [[Gateworld]] announced the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|SCI FI Channel]]'s decision to not renew their order of ''Stargate SG-1'' for the coming year.<ref name=cancel/> This was later confirmed by the Channel, along with an announcement that ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' had been picked up for another season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=37607|title=SG-1 Ends Run; Atlantis Back|accessdate=2007-12-29|date=2006-08-01|publisher=SCI FI Channel|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080504165850/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=37607|archivedate=May 4, 2008}}</ref> Many fans denounced the timing of the announcement, as it was apparently made while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode's airing.<ref name=cancel>{{cite web|author=McNamara, Mary|date=2006-08-21|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6364450.html?display=Breaking+News|title=Sci Fi<U+2019>s Stargate SG-1 Said to Be Axed|publisher=multichannel.com|accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> While ratings were not as high as previous seasons, the series was still drawing respectable audiences, including a season average of 2&nbsp;million viewers in Australia, half of them falling into the 18-49 demographic. Sci Fi responded that the cancellation was not about ratings so much as a feeling the series had run its course.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|date=2006-08-30|title=Stargate dropped into black hole|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|page=4}}</ref> Characters from ''SG-1'' would make appearances on ''Atlantis'' and in direct-to-DVD films such as ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Vanderklippe, Nathan|date=2007-03-31|title=B.C. films: The sequel; Direct-to-video production proving to be a lifeline for West Coast film industry|work=National Post's Financial Post|page=3}}</ref>
