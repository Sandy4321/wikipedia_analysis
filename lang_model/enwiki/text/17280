He is the longest serving locally elected city mayor in [[Turkey]], currently at his 5th term. Adding his 17 years as a [[Councillor|municipal councillor]], he will have served the municipality of Adana for 42 years by the end of this term. He was the president of the Municipalities Union of Turkey for 17 years and the [[<U+00C7>ukurova]] Municipalities Union for 12 years.

Ayta<U+00E7> Durak is the only politician to have run in all the municipal elections since 1973; twice as councillor, six times as mayoral candidate, losing only once in the 1989 mayoral race. He is regarded as the doyen of Turkey's local politics.

==Early life==
Ayta<U+00E7> Durak was born in [[Karaisal<U+0131>]] district of [[Adana Province]] in 1938 to a middle-class merchant family. He was the second eldest of the six siblings. He completed his primary education (Grade 1-5) at Gazipa<U+015F>a Public School, secondary education  at [[Tepeba<U+011F>]] Middle School (Grade 6-8) and at Adana Lycee for Boys (Grade 9-11). He studied [[Civil Engineering]] at [[Istanbul Technical University]] from 1957 to 1963.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://adana-bld.gov.tr/adanabld.asp?siteID=2&DilID=1&KatID=3&sayfaID=8 | title = Ayta<U+00E7> Durak Biography|author=|publisher=Greater Adana Municipality | accessdate=}}</ref>

==Career==
He started his career in 1963 at [[State Hydraulic Works (Turkey)|State Hydraulic Works(DS<U+0130>)]] as Drinking Water Chief of Adana.  In 1965, he was appointed as YSE (Road-Water-Electric Agency now called Rural Services) Director for [[Adana Province]].

At the mean time, he became the member of Adana Chamber of Commerce. He completed compulsory military service at Ankara-Mamak War Institute and Military Research and Development Agency. Later in his life, he founded a construction company (Durak <U+0130>n<U+015F>aat) with his 2 civil engineer brothers and, during the 1970s and early 1980s, he built over 2000 homes.

===Adana Municipal Councillor ===
In [[Turkish local elections, 1963|1963]], after starting his career at DS<U+0130>, he was appointed as Adana municipal councillor representing DS<U+0130>. After two terms as appointed Municipal Councillor, in [[Turkish local elections, 1973|1973 municipal elections]], he ran from [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] and elected as municipal councillor. In [[Turkish local elections, 1977|1977]] he was re-elected and also acted as the speaker of the Justice Party at the council. He served two terms as elected councillor and removed from the council by [[1980 Turkish coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] on September 12, 1980 with all the other politicians in [[Turkey]]. Municipal democracy was suspended until 1984.

During the years that he was at the council, he formed the ideas that will later revolutionize the cityscape; expanding city to north and revitalizing [[Seyhan River]] and building large recreational areas around it.

===Mayor of Adana===

At the [[Turkish local elections, 1984|municipal elections on March 25, 1984]], he was elected Mayor of Adana representing [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party(ANAP)]]. During his first term as mayor, he expanded city to north by planning a modern residential district to house 200 thousand residents. He named this district as Yeni Adana (New Adana). He constructed Adnan Menderes Boulevard along the south shores of Seyhan Reservoir and built parks, picnic areas around it. Adnan Menderes Boulevard then became the main recreational area for the city. He built Reg<U+00FC>lat<U+00F6>r K<U+00F6>pr<U+00FC> on Seyhan river south of the old town, a bridge which also acts as a regulator of river water. This caused the part of the river, that is within the city limits, to be full all year around. The river which used to partially dry and have odour in summer times, revitalized and became the core recreational area of the city. During this term, he also founded municipal-owned not-for-profit construction company which built thousands of homes for low-income residents.

Although having a successful term, at the [[Turkish local elections, 1989|municipal elections of 1989]], he lost his post to [[Selahattin <U+00C7>olak]]. This was due to the partisan municipal election system in Turkey. His party ANAP was the governing party, but became very unpopular during this time. To protest the governing party, voters chose opposition parties' candidates during the municipal elections without considering candidates' individual skills.

At the [[Turkish local elections, 1994|municipal elections of March 27, 1994]] he was re-elected as mayor of Adana again representing ANAP, this time voters focusing on candidates' skills by comparing his term to Selahattin <U+00C7>olak's term. At this term, he started building recreational pathways on both banks of Seyhan river from south end to Seyhan Reservoir. He gave special attention to '''Dilberler Sekisi''', most scenic part of the recreational pathway between the old and the new dam. He renovated Atat<U+00FC>rk Park and many other parks, built new recreational areas on the northern section of the city. He continued building infrastructure to expand city to north. The construction of Adana Metro, 13.5&nbsp;km long rapid transit system, started in 1997.

He was re-elected to the office in [[Turkish local elections, 1999|1999]] representing ANAP for the third term. At this term he started the construction of [[Adana Merkez Park|Merkez Park]], a 33-hectar [[urban park]] along Seyhan river, which is now one of the largest urban parks in Turkey. At this period, he also started building public pools for safe swimming mostly at low-income neighborhoods due the fact that nearly 100 children suffocate every year when chilling out at Seyhan river and irrigation canals during the hot and humid summers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=4096348 | title = Adana`da bu sene 3 bo<U+011F>ulma ya<U+015F>and<U+0131>. (Turkish)|author=|publisher=Cihan News Agency | accessdate=10/09/2009}}</ref> Currently city boasts 35 municipal swimming pools built only within the last 10 years.

Before the [[Turkish local elections, 2004|municipal elections of 2004]], he resigned from ANAP and joined [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party(AK Party)]]. ANAP had only 5.1% of the popular votes in [[Turkish general election, 2002|2002 General Elections]] and became a minor party after. On March 28, 2004 he was re-elected as mayor of Adana for the fourth term receiving 39% of popular votes. During this period, he completed the construction of [[Adana Merkez Park|Merkez Park]] and many other parks, thus, city became much greener. The construction of Adana Metro was suspended during this period due to financial reasons. Construction resumed in 2008 and expected to be completed by the end of 2009. Metro that is under construction for 12 years is the major headache for Ayta<U+00E7> Durak.

In late 2008, AK Party decided not to make Ayta<U+00E7> Durak their candidate for [[Turkish local elections, 2009|2009 municipal elections]]. Following immediately, Durak resigned from AK Party and joined [[Nationalist Movement Party|Nationalist Movement Party (MHP)]]. This election was one of his most difficult elections and although being a candidate of the third popular party, his high profile helped him win the elections with only 1,500 vote margin against governing AK Party candidate. For his 5th term, Durak promised to complete urban redevelopment projects for Sinanpa<U+015F>a, G<U+00F6>l and Fatih neighborhoods, and building the second line for Metro which will extend from Sinanpa<U+015F>a to [[<U+00C7>ukurova University]].

On March 17, 2010 Ayta<U+00E7> Durak resigned from MHP until being cleared from allegations for fortune building by raising the land value of his family property.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.milliyet.com.tr/aytac-durak-istifa-etti-/siyaset/sondakika/17.03.2010/1212790/default.htm | title = Ayta<U+00E7> Durak istifa etti (Turkish)|author=|publisher=Milliyet | accessdate=2010-03-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100322192032/http://www.milliyet.com.tr/aytac-durak-istifa-etti-/siyaset/sondakika/17.03.2010/1212790/default.htm| archivedate= 22 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> On March 28, Ayta<U+00E7> Durak is suspended from mayoral duties by Ministry of Internal Affairs for two months.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetay&ArticleID=988248&Date=28.03.2010&CategoryID=78 | title = Ayta<U+00E7> Durak a<U+00E7><U+0131><U+011F>a al<U+0131>nd<U+0131>.(Turkish)|author=|publisher=Radikal | accessdate=2010-03-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100331175600/http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?aType=RadikalDetay&ArticleID=988248&Date=28.03.2010&CategoryID=78| archivedate= 31 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===President of Municipalities Union of Turkey (TBB)===

In 1987, he was elected the president of TBB, an agency to build co-operation among municipalities. He left this position in 1989, due to not being re-elected as mayor of Adana. After his election as [[Adana]] mayor in 1994, he was elected again as the president of the Union of Municipalities of Turkey. He held the title until April'09, when he was removed from the post by Ministry of Internal Affairs. Durak and his party [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]] protested removal, stating that  presidency ends naturally at Union's Directors' Elections by not being re-elected.

During his presidency of TBB, he went to court for the unequal municipal taxation law. With the old municipal tax law, the corporates used to pay municipal taxes at the location of their headquarters which are mainly in [[Istanbul]] and [[Ankara]]. This caused lack of revenue for other cities. The court found municipal taxation system was not fair and the parliament changed the law, which made a better distribution of municipal revenue among cities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.idealistgazetesi.com/Man%C5%9Fet%20Haberler/manset-haberler/463-ankaraanin-icrasina-adanaadan-itiraz.html | title = Ankara'n<U+0131>n icras<U+0131>na Adana'dan itiraz. (Turkish)|author=|publisher=<U+0130>dealist Gazetesi | accessdate=2009-08-29}}</ref>

One of his major concerns as TBB president was the partisan municipal election system. He criticized the current system for creating dependency to national politics. Almost all the time, mayor of a municipality is chosen among one of the candidates of the national parties. Independent candidacy is possible, but very difficult to succeed; the only independent winner of a city in 2009 was E<U+015F>ref Fak<U+0131>baba of [[<U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa]]. Before 2009 elections, Durak lobbied at the national level for change in the municipal election system. He proposed an election system where all the candidates have to run independently without representing any political party; a system that is used in many western countries.

===President of <U+00C7>ukurova Municipalities Union (<U+00C7>BB)===

[[<U+00C7>ukurova]], a geographical, economical and cultural region, is separated with high mountains from other regions and resembles more like a state of its own. Although, the economical and cultural issues that communities in [[<U+00C7>ukurova]] face are similar, interrelations among the communities were poor. Durak with other mayors of the region wanted to improve co-operation among the communities of [[<U+00C7>ukurova]]. <U+00C7>ukurova Municipalities Union was incorporated in 1997 to be a voice of the local governments in the region. Durak was elected the first president of <U+00C7>BB.

Ayta<U+00E7> Durak focused on improving the municipal governing skills of all the municipal staff in [[<U+00C7>ukurova]]. Regular internal education seminars are held throoughout the region. Organized with the support of the municipalities, region-wide cultural events became common. <U+00C7>ukurova Art Days is a four-day festival that takes place throughout [[<U+00C7>ukurova]] since 2007.

After 12 years as the president of <U+00C7>BB, Durak did not run again in the 2009 General Assembly. Mayor of [[Mersin]], [[Macit <U+00D6>zcan]], is elected the second president of <U+00C7>BB.

==Personal life==
He is married to T<U+00FC>rkan Durak and has two children. His son, G<U+00F6>khan Durak, who is also a Civil Engineer, runs a local television (<U+00C7>ukurova TV) in Adana. His daughter has a degree in Landscape Architecture.

Durak likes spending his summer leisure times with  his grand children at his cottage in K<U+0131>z<U+0131>lda<U+011F> plateau of [[Karaisal<U+0131>]]. He regularly goes to [[5 Ocak Stadium]] to watch the football games of [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]]. He frequently attends theaters and music concerts.

Ayta<U+00E7> Durak is famed in [[Turkey]], for avoiding kissing men when greeting. In greeting traditions of [[Turkey]], men shake hands and kiss each other from both cheeks. During the long greeting ceremonies of political parties, Durak considered kissing each other is not healthy and time consuming. He rathered just shaking hands.
