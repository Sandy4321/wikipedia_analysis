The UK '''Port Marine Safety Code''' (PMSC) was developed in 2000 and offers a national standard for [[port]] safety in the [[UK]] with the aim to "improve safety for those who use or work in ports, their ships, passengers and cargoes, and the environment"<ref> [http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/shippingports/ports/pmsc/portmarinesafetycode Keith Hill, MP, Minister for Shipping, Department for Transport website]</ref>.  All [[Harbour Authorities]] must comply with the code which, while not law, is not compulsory<ref> [http://www.marineenforcement.co.uk/pmsc.html Marine Enforcement website] </ref>.  It can be found here: [http://www.coastms.co.uk/PortsandtheEnvironment/Advice%20Encyclopedias%20CD/Port%20Marine%20Safety%20Code.pdf].

The Code reported on the ''[[Dieppe ship|Dieppe]]'' which grounded at [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] in December 2005.
