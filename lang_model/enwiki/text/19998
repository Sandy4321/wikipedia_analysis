'''Lucy No<U+00EB>l Martha (No<U+00EB>lle), Countess of Rothes''' (25 December 1878 <U+2013> 12 September 1956) was the wife of the [[Norman Leslie, 19th Earl of Rothes|19th Earl of Rothes]]. A noted philanthropist and social leader, she was a heroine of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] disaster, famous for taking the tiller of her lifeboat and later helping row the craft to the safety of the rescue ship ''[[RMS Carpathia|Carpathia]]''.<ref>''New York Times'', 20 April 1912.</ref> The countess was for many years a popular figure in London society, known for her blonde beauty, bright personality, graceful dancing and the diligence with which she helped organize lavish entertainments patronized by English royalty and members of the nobility.<ref>''The Bystander'' (London), 27 November 1907, p. 408; ''The Times'', 13 June 1911, p. 12; and 21 November 1912, p. 8.</ref> She was long involved in charity work throughout the U.K., most notably assisting the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|Red Cross]] with fundraising and as a nurse for the Coulter Hospital in London during [[World War I]].<ref>''Tatler'' (London), 24 July 1918, p.95.</ref> Lady Rothes was also a leading benefactor of the [[Queen Victoria School]] and The Chelsea Hospital for Women, known today as [[Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/countess.html A Matter of Course : The Story of Noelle Rothes, Titanic's "Plucky Little Countess" by Randy Bryan Bigham]; ''The Times'', 6 May 1914, p. 4; and 16 December 1916, p. 11.</ref>

==Childhood and married life==
Born in Kensington, London, "No<U+00EB>lle," as she spelled her forename of choice, was the only child of Thomas and Clementina Dyer-Edwardes. She was brought up at Prinknash Park, Gloucestershire, and Chateau de Retival, Caudebec-en-Caux, Normandy.<ref>''The Sketch'' (London), 20 December 1916, p. 243.</ref> No<U+00EB>lle Dyer-Edwardes married Norman Leslie, Earl of Rothes (pronounced "Roth-ez") on [[Primrose Day]], 19 April 1900 at [[St Mary Abbots]], Kensington, London.<ref>''The Sketch'' (London), 25 April 1900, p. 8.</ref>

The countess' husband headed one of the oldest peerages in the United Kingdom, dating to before 1457, and was elected a [[Representative peer]] for Scotland, a position he held between 1906 and 1923. The Leslie family earldom was also one of the few which recognized the right of descent through female heirs. The [[Clan Leslie]] motto is "Grip Fast." Lord Rothes was a captain in the Fife [[Royal Garrison Artillery]] Militia, a lieutenant in the [[Royal Highland Regiment]], known as the Black Watch, and a lieutenant-colonel in the Highland Cyclist Battalion.

The Leslies resided in England until 1904 when they took possession of the 10,000-acre family seat in Scotland, Leslie House in [[Leslie, Fife]].<ref>''The Bystander'' (London), 27 November 1907, p. 408.</ref> Although the couple kept homes in England, including a townhouse in [[Chelsea, London]], they lived most of each year at their Scottish estate. The earl and countess shared a wide range of sporting interests, from hunting to cricket, and were active socially, attending royal and other society functions. They were frequently mentioned in the daily press, and No<U+00EB>lle Rothes, in particular, was often photographed in the illustrated weeklies in London.<ref>''Tatler'' (London), 28 September 1910; ''The Bystander'' (London), 28 September 1910, p. 631; ''The Times'', 16 May 1903; 30 July 1908; and 13 June 1910; ''Tatler'' (London), 24 July 1918, p. 95; ''The Sketch'', 28 July 1920, p. 3.</ref>

Lord and Lady Rothes had two children:
* [[Malcolm Leslie, 20th Earl of Rothes|Malcolm George Dyer-Edwardes Leslie, Lord Leslie]] (later 20th Earl of Rothes) (1902<U+2013>1975), married Beryl Violet Dugdale, daughter of Captain James Lionel Dugdale and Maud Violet Woodroffe, on 17 July 1926 and had issue.
* The Honourable John Wayland Leslie (1909<U+2013>1991). He had issue.

In 1916 the earl was wounded in action in France during the First World War and recovered at the Coulter Hospital in London. He ascended to the rank of [[colonel]] in 1918.

==Philanthropy, society and politics==
No<U+00EB>lle Rothes became well known for her prolific charitable work in England and Scotland. One of her first projects was helping arrange the [[Royal Caledonian Ball]] which annually benefited the [[Royal Caledonian School]]s. The countess was also active for a number of years in fundraising for the Queen Victoria School, the Randolph Wemyss Memorial Hospital and the Chelsea Hospital for Women.

In addition, she served on the organizing or fundraising committees for such agencies as the The Princess Mary Scholarship at Cedars College for Blind Girls, the YMCA Bazaar, The Children's Guild, the Deptford Fund and the Village Clubs Association.<ref>''The Times'', 11 September 1922; 2 November 1920; 10 July 1907; and 1 November 1921.</ref> She also assisted [[Millicent Leveson-Gower, Duchess of Sutherland|the Duchess of Sutherland]] in planning costume balls and garden parties in aid of the National Milk Hostels which provided "wholesome milk for poor families."<ref>''The Times'', 10 April 1919, p. 18; and 25 June 1920.</ref> No<U+00EB>lle was joined in her charity work by other leading figures in London society, including [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]], [[Evelyn Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|the Duchess of Devonshire]], [[Consuelo Vanderbilt|the Duchess of Marlborough]] and Lady Juliet Duff.<ref>''The Times'', 21 June 1911,p. 13; and 21 November 1912, p. 8.</ref>

In 1911 No<U+00EB>lle began her long association with the Red Cross, establishing a branch in Leslie and endowing it with three ambulances. This led to a larger ambulance corps serving Fife, called the Countess of Rothes Voluntary Aid Detachment. That year she also underwent training herself as a nurse. Despite her busy work for national charities, No<U+00EB>lle remained devoted to the welfare of local citizens. Along with holding village Christmas parties in Leslie, she established a club for young girls employed in Falkland factories, funded a clinic in the parish of Kinglassie and planned parties for the 2nd Battalion of the [[Highland Light Infantry]].<ref name="encyclopedia-titanica.org">[http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/countess.html A Matter of Course : The Story of Noelle Rothes, Titanic's "Plucky Little Countess" by Randy Bryan Bigham]</ref>

No<U+00EB>lle's success as a patroness of philanthropic causes owed to her energetic personality and organizational skills but also to her popularity as a hostess, her beauty and her friendships with members of the [[British Royal Family]] and aristocracy, including H.R.H. [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] and [[Dorothy Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington|the Duchess of Wellington]]. She was an exceptionally adept dancer and amateur actress which she demonstrated at the entertainments she either hosted or organized for charity. Among these were a 1910 pageant at Falkland Palace, which she not only directed but appeared in; the "Tally Ho!" Ball the following year at Edinburgh's Musical Hall, where she danced in a special quadrille reel named for her; and the Coronation Garden Party later in 1911 at Devonshire House where she performed in a minuet that opened the festivity.

The countess was politically active. Although a Conservative, she supported the suffrage cause as a member of the [[Conservative and Unionist Women's Franchise Association|Women's Unionist Association]], chairing local chapters of the group at [[Markinch]] and in Leslie. She also opposed socialist initiatives and the proposed reform of Irish [[Home Rule]].

Perhaps her finest achievement in service to others was nursing soldiers during World War I, first at Leslie House, a wing of which she converted into a hospital for troops invalided out of the conflict, and then at the Coulter Hospital in London. There she nursed her own husband after he was wounded in battle in 1916. She found the work fulfilling and stayed on for two years.<ref>''Tatler'' (London), 24 July 1918, p. 95.</ref> During her time with the Coulter Hospital, No<U+00EB>lle helped produce the Hurlingham Fete, Fair and Sports, benefiting wounded soldiers, in 1918.<ref>''The Sketch'' (London), 10 July 1918, p. 40.</ref>

==''Titanic'' disaster==
No<U+00EB>lle Rothes is best known as a heroine of the 1912 [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] tragedy, helping to command her lifeboat, in concert with Able Seaman Thomas William (Tom) Jones. No<U+00EB>lle handled the tiller of the boat, steering it clear of the sinking liner, and later assisted in rowing it to the rescue ship, all the while encouraging other survivors with her calm decisiveness and optimism.<ref name="isbn978-0-307-98470-8">{{cite book |author=Brewster, Hugh |title=Gilded Lives, Fatal Voyage |publisher=Crown Publishers |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-307-98470-8 |oclc= |pages=217<U+2013>218, 288}}</ref> She embarked at [[Southampton]] on 10 April with her parents, Thomas and Clementina Dyer-Edwardes, her husband's cousin [[Gladys Cherry]], and her maid Roberta Maioni.<ref>''New York Herald'', 10 April 1912, p. 3.</ref> Her parents disembarked at [[Cherbourg]], while the others continued, en route for New York and possibly [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] to meet the Earl of Rothes who was visiting the U.S. and Canada on business. Before the ''Titanic'' left Southampton, No<U+00EB>lle granted an interview to a London correspondent for ''The New York Herald'' in which she explained she was going to the U.S. to join her husband who was at that time touring the west coast. She admitted they were also personally interested in purchasing an orange grove there. Asked by the reporter how she felt about "leaving London society for a California fruit farm," No<U+00EB>lle replied, "I am full of joyful expectation."<ref>''New York Herald'', 11 April 1912, p. 1; London ''Daily Graphic'', 20 April 1912, p.9.</ref>

While No<U+00EB>lle and Gladys were originally installed in a basic first class cabin, C-37, it is believed they upgraded to a more commodious suite, C-77. In an American press interview, Rothes was quoted as saying she and Cherry occupied stateroom B-77.<ref name="New York Herald 1912, p. 1">''New York Herald'', 22 April 1912, p. 1.</ref> The women were in their beds when the ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. on the night of 14 April. The pair was awakened by the crash and went up on deck to investigate. There they were instructed by [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Captain E.J. Smith]], the ''Titanic'''s commander, to return to their cabin and don lifejackets.<ref name="New York Herald 1912, p. 1"/>

No<U+00EB>lle, Gladys and No<U+00EB>lle's maid were rescued in [[Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic#Boat 8 (port)|lifeboat 8]], which was lowered at approximately 1:00 a.m., over an hour after the collision. The boat was launched simultaneously with Lifeboat 6 but reached the water first, making it the first lifeboat afloat on the port side of the ship. Tom Jones, the Able Seaman placed in charge of the boat by Captain Smith, later said Rothes "had a lot to say, so I put her to steering the boat," a roundabout compliment to her leadership abilities.<ref name="isbn0-03-027615-2">{{cite book |author=Lord, Walter |title=A Night to Remember |publisher=Holt, Rinehart & Winston |location=New York |year=1955 |isbn=978-0-307-98470-8 |oclc= |page=125}}; ''New York Times'', 20 April 1912</ref> She took charge of the tiller, steering for over an hour before asking Gladys to take over while she stopped to comfort a young Spanish newlywed, Mar<U+00ED>a de Soto y Pe<U+00F1>asco, whose husband was lost in the sinking. There she remained for the duration of the night, rowing all the while and helping to boost the morale of other women until their lifeboat was picked up by the {{RMS|Carpathia}} early the next morning.

When the ''Carpathia'' was sighted, cheers went up and several in their boat started to sing the [[Philip Bliss]] hymn "Pull for the Shore." Afterwards, No<U+00EB>lle suggested "[[Lead, Kindly Light]]": "Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom/Lead thou me on!/The night is dark, and I'm far from home/Lead thou me on!"

Once aboard the rescue vessel, she devoted herself to the care of steerage women and children from the ''Titanic''.<ref name="isbn0-684-85710-3">{{cite book |author=Lehrer, Stanley; McMillan, Beverly |title=Titanic: Fortune & Fate |publisher=Simon & Schuster |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-684-85710-3 |oclc= |page=96}}</ref>  As an account in the London ''Daily Sketch'' would record: "Her Ladyship helped to make clothes for the babies and became known amongst the crew as the 'plucky little countess.'" The newspaper added that a stewardess told No<U+00EB>lle, "You have made yourself famous by rowing in the boat," to which she replied, "I hope not. I have done nothing." <ref>London ''Daily Sketch'', 30 April 1912.</ref>

No<U+00EB>lle did not welcome the publicity that proclaimed her a heroine, insisting it was the cool-headed leadership of Seaman Jones and the combined aid of her cousin-in-law and other occupants in the boat that night that deserved praise. As a token of her esteem, she presented Jones with an inscribed silver pocket watch; she also gave one to Steward Alfred Crawford in recognition for his assistance at the oars, rowing "doggedly for five hours." Jones later returned the largesse by gifting her the brass number plate from their lifeboat. No<U+00EB>lle wrote to Jones every Christmas, and the two maintained a correspondence until her death.<ref name="isbn978-0-307-98470-8">{{cite book |author=Brewster, Hugh |title=Gilded Lives, Fatal Voyage |publisher=Crown Publishers |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-307-98470-8 |oclc= |page=288}}</ref> The number plate is now in the possession of the Countess' grandson Alastair Leslie. The family also re-acquired Jones' watch when it was auctioned by his family after his death.

The Royal Naval Lifeboat Institute's Fraserburgh Lifeboat, introduced to service in 1915, was christened ''Lady Rothes''. The lifeboat was provided as a gift from Thomas Dyer-Edwardes, the countess' father, in gratitude for his daughter's rescue from the ''Titanic''.<ref name="encyclopedia-titanica.org"/>

In 1918 an exhibition at the Grafton Galleries in London, benefiting the Red Cross, included a pair of pearls from the 300 year old heirloom necklace No<U+00EB>lle wore when she escaped the ''Titanic''.

==Later life and second marriage==
After Norman Rothes died in March 1927, No<U+00EB>lle remarried on 22 December 1927, to Colonel Claud Macfie, DSO, in London. The countess retained her title. The couple had no children. While No<U+00EB>lle and Claud maintained a home in Sussex, they lived most of the year at the Macfie estate, Fayre Court at [[Fairford]], Gloucestershire.

In her last years No<U+00EB>lle was interviewed by author [[Walter Lord]] for his epic account of the ''Titanic'' disaster, ''[[A Night to Remember (book)|A Night to Remember]]'', which brought her compelling story to a new generation on its publication in 1955.

No<U+00EB>lle, Countess of Rothes died in [[Hove]], Sussex, on 12 September 1956, having suffered for some time from heart disease. A memorial plaque was erected in her honor on the west wall of the chancel of [[Fairford|St Mary's Church]] in Fairford. It reads: "No<U+00EB>lle, Widow of the 19th Earl of Rothes, and Beloved Wife of Col. Claud Macfie D.S.O. of Fayre Court, Fairford, At Rest 12 Sept. 1956. Holiness is an infinite compassion for others. Greatness is to take the common things of life and walk truly among them. Happiness is a great love and much serving."<ref name="isbn978-1-84868-951-0">{{cite book |author=Lewis-Jones, June |title=Around Fairford: Through Time |publisher=Amberley Publishing |location=Gloucestershire |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-84868-951-0 |oclc= |page=37}}</ref>

==Legacy==

No<U+00EB>lle was portrayed in the 1979 television movie ''[[SOS Titanic]]'' by Kate Howard; in [[James Cameron]]'s 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' by Rochelle Rose; and in [[Julian Fellowes]]'s 2012 mini-series ''[[Titanic (2012 miniseries)|Titanic]]'' by Pandora Colin. She is also mentioned in the first episode of the British TV series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' as having spent some time with the Crawley family shortly before boarding the ''Titanic.'' Upon hearing of the disaster, the character of Cora, Countess of Grantham remarks; "Isn't this terrible? When you think how excited Lucy Rothes was at the prospect.'"

The bestselling 2012 e-book ''Lifeboat No. 8'', by Elizabeth Kaye, focused on the countess' experiences in the ''Titanic'''s sinking.
