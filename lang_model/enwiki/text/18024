==Geography==
[[Image:Beograd_Sat.png|250px|thumb|left|Satellite view of Belgrade]]
Belgrade lies 116.75 [[metre|m]] above [[sea level]], at [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] 44<U+00B0>49'14" North 20<U+00B0>27'44" East. The historical core of Belgrade (today's [[Kalemegdan]]) is on the right bank of [[Sava river|Sava]] and [[Danube]] rivers. However, as the city grew, it expanded over the Sava river, so that now it includes [[Novi Beograd|New Belgrade]] and [[Zemun]], both on Sava's left bank. The city is located at the [[confluence]] of the Danube and Sava rivers. The city has an urban area of 359.96 [[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]], while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3222.68 km<U+00B2>. Belgrade, like many other cities, is considered a crossroads between the [[Western world|West]] and [[the Orient]].<ref>[http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201029 City of Belgrade - Geographical Position]</ref>

Singidunum experienced occupation by successive invaders of the region<U+2014>[[Huns]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]]<U+2014>before the arrival of the [[Slavic peoples|Slav]]s ([[Serbs]]) around 630 AD. The first record of the Slavic name ''Beograd'' dates back to 878 AD, during the rule of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. For about four centuries the city remained a subject of warfare between [[Byzantium]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Royal Hungary]] and the First Bulgarian Empire.<ref name="bhistory">[http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201243 City of Belgrade - History (Byzantine Empire)]</ref> It finally passed to Serbian rule as a part of the [[Kingdom of Syrmia]] in 1284. The first [[List of Serbian monarchs|Serbian king]] to rule over Belgrade was [[Stefan Dragutin|Dragutin]] (1276<U+2013>1282), the ruler of the Kingdom of Syrmia, who received it as a gift from his [[father-in-law]], the Hungarian king [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislav IV]].<ref name="MSH">[http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201247 City of Belgrade - History (Medieval Serbian Belgrade)]</ref>

Following terrible losses at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] of 1389, the [[Serbian Empire]] began to crumble, the south being conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046112/Battle-of-Kosovo Encyclopaedia Britannica: Battle of Kosovo]</ref> However, the north resisted in the form of the [[Serbian Despotate]], which had Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under [[Despot]] [[Stefan Lazarevi<U+0107>]], son of the famous Serbian ruler [[Prince Lazar|Lazar Hrebljanovi<U+0107>]]. Its ancient walls were refortified, along with its castles, harbours and churches, which helped the Despotate to avoid surrender to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] for almost 70 years. At that time Belgrade became a haven for many Balkan peoples escaping Ottoman control. It is thought that the city had a population of some 40-50,000 at this time. During the reign of [[George, Prince of Rascia|<U+0110>ura<U+0111> Brankovi<U+0107>]], most of the Serbian Despotate fell to the Ottomans, but Belgrade itself invited in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian kings]] for protection.<ref name="MSH">source</ref> The Ottomans, however, wanted to conquer Belgrade as it presented an obstacle to their further advance into [[central Europe]]. They attacked in 1456, leading to the famous [[Siege of Belgrade]] where the [[Christendom|Christian]] army under [[John Hunyadi]] successfully defended the city from the Ottomans.<ref>[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3030796.html Ottoman-Hungarian Wars: Siege of Belgrade in 1456 by Tom R.

===Turkish conquest===
Under [[Suleyman the Magnificent]], on [[28 August]] [[1521]], the fort was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The city was largely razed to the ground by the conquering Ottomans. For the next 150 years or so it was a peaceful town, and the seat of the district ([[sanjak]]). It attracted new traders and inhabitants - [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], [[Ragusa]]n traders, and others. It is thought that the city's population was around the 100,000 mark in the [[17th century]]. It became more of an [[Oriental]] town, with [[Ottoman architecture]] and many new [[mosque]]s.<ref name="imperialrule">[http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201251 City of Belgrade - History (Turkish and Austrian Rule)]</ref> It was affected by a major Serb rebellion in [[1594]] (the [[Banat Uprising]]), which was crushed by the Turks, who burned churches and the relics (mortal remains) of [[Saint Sava]] on the [[Vra<U+010D>ar plateau]], an event the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] was built to commemorate in more recent times.<ref>[http://www.mitropolija.cg.yu/dvavoda/knjige/aradovic-hram_l.html <U+0414><U+0443><U+0445><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0438> <U+0441><U+043C><U+0438><U+0441><U+0430><U+043E> <U+0445><U+0440><U+0430><U+043C><U+0430> <U+0421><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+043E><U+0433> <U+0421><U+0430><U+0432><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0412><U+0440><U+0430><U+0447><U+0430><U+0440><U+0443> - <U+0410><U+043C><U+0444><U+0438><U+043B><U+043E><U+0445><U+0438><U+0458><U+0435> <U+0420><U+0430><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>, <U+0415><U+043F><U+0438><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043F> <U+0431><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0442><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438>]</ref>

Thrice occupied by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] (1688-1690, 1717-1739, 1789-1791), it was recaptured and substantially razed each time by the Ottomans.<ref name="imperialrule">src</ref> During this period, the city was affected by the two [[Great Serbian Migrations]], in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by their [[Patriarch of Serbia|patriarchs]], retreated together with the Austrians into the Habsburg Empire in 1690 and 1737-39, settling in today's [[Vojvodina]] and [[Slavonia]].<ref>[http://www.suc.org/culture/library/Oci/tajne-poruke-svetoga-save-16-03-03.html <U+0421><U+0440><U+043F><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438> <U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0433><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441> <U+0443><U+0458><U+0435><U+0434><U+0438><U+045A><U+0435><U+045A><U+0430> - <U+0422><U+0430><U+0458><U+043D><U+0435> <U+043F><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+043A><U+0435> <U+0421><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+043E><U+0433> <U+0421><U+0430><U+0432><U+0435>]</ref> During the [[First Serbian Uprising]] the Serbian rebels held the city from [[January 8]] [[1806]] to [[1813]], when it was retaken by the Ottomans.<ref name="bglib">[http://www.beograd.org.yu/cms/view.php?id=201255 City of Belgrade - History (Liberation of Belgrade)]</ref> In [[1817]] it became the capital of the autonomous [[Principality of Serbia]] (except in the period from [[1818]]<U+2013>[[1841]], when [[Kragujevac]] was the country's capital).<ref>[http://www.kragujevac.org.yu/upoznajte_grad/istorija.htm <U+0413><U+0440><U+0430><U+0434> <U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+0433><U+0443><U+0458><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430><U+0446> - <U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430> (<U+041F><U+0440><U+0432><U+0430> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043D><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0434><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+0435> <U+0421><U+0440><U+0431><U+0438><U+0458><U+0435>)]</ref>

===After independence===
[[Image:Knez stara.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Knez Mihailova street at the beginning of the 20th century]]
The capital was moved from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade by [[Mihailo Obrenovi<U+0107> III, Prince of Serbia|Prince Mihailo Obrenovi<U+0107>]], following the departure of the town's Turkish garrison in 1867.

After the occupation by Austro-Hungarian and [[German Empire|German]] troops in 1915-1918 during the First World War, Belgrade experienced faster growth and significant modernisation as the capital of the new [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during the [[1920s]] and [[1930s]], growing in population to 239,000 by 1931 with the incorporation of the western suburb of Zemun, formerly on the Austro-Hungarian bank of the river. By 1940, the population had reached about 320,000. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.<ref name="stan">src</ref>
[[Image:Terazije 1928.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Terazije|Terazije square]] in 1928]] 
On [[March 25]] [[1941]], the government signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], joining the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] in an effort to stay out of the [[Second World War]]. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]. Consequently, the city was [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II#German bombing|heavily bombed]] by the [[Luftwaffe]] on [[April 6]]-[[April 7|7]], [[1941]], killing thousands of people. [[Yugoslavia]] was [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany|German]], [[Italian fascism|Italian]], [[Hungary between the two world wars|Hungarian]] and [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgarian]] forces and the western suburbs were incorporated into a Nazi [[puppet state]], the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II#Allied bombing|The city was bombed]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] as well, on [[April 16]]-[[April 17|17]] [[1944]]. Both bombings happened to fall on [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] [[Easter#Eastern Christianity 2|Easter]]. Most of the city remained under German occupation until [[October 20]] [[1944]], when it was liberated by communist [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Partisans]] and the [[Red Army]]. In the post-war period Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|renewed Yugoslavia]], developing as a major industrial centre.<ref name="20c">src</ref>
In March 1972, Belgrade was at the centre of [[1972 outbreak of smallpox in Yugoslavia|the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe]].

[[Image:IM000487 resize.JPG|thumb|250px|The building of the [[National Bank of Serbia]], near [[Slavija (Belgrade)|Slavija Square]]]]
Belgrade is the most [[Economy of Serbia|economically developed]] part of Serbia. More than 30% of Serbia's GDP is generated by the city, which also has more than 30% of Serbia's employed population.<ref>[http://www.kombeg.org.yu/privredabg/privreda.htm <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0432><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+043D><U+0430> <U+041A><U+043E><U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0430> <U+0411><U+0435><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0434><U+0430> - <U+041F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0432><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0430> <U+0411><U+0435><U+043E><U+0440><U+0433><U+0430><U+0434><U+0430>]</ref> The city's economy has been growing strongly since [[2000]]. During the 1990s the city was severely affected, like the rest of Serbia, by an internationally imposed trade embargo. The hyperinflation of the [[Yugoslav dinar]], the highest ever recorded in the world, also decimated the city's economy. The [[National Bank of Serbia]] is located in the city. Major companies based in Belgrade include [[Jat Airways]], [[Telekom Srbija]], [[Telenor Serbia]], [[Delta Holding]], and many others.

As of October [[2006]], the average [[Gross income|gross salary]] in Belgrade amounted to 41,006 [[Serbian dinar]]s (about 530 [[euro]]s, 675 [[United States dollar|US dollars]], or 355 [[Pound sterling|British pounds]]) the highest of any district in Serbia. The average [[Net pay|net salary]] was 28,090 Serbian dinars (about 365 euros, 465 US dollars, or 245 British pounds).<ref>[http://webrzs.statserb.sr.gov.yu/axd/en/dokumenti/zp14102006.pdf Republic of Serbia - Statistical Office of the Republic: Salaries and wages per employee, October 2006]</ref>

Weekend visitors<U+2014>particularly from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]<U+2014>consider Belgrade more of a metropolis than the capitals of their own countries, due to what they see as the friendly atmosphere, great clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, and the lack of restrictive night life regulation.<ref name="slovenci">[http://www.b92.net/srbija2020/info.php?yyyy=2006&mm=03&nav_category=182&nav_id=192870&fs=1 B92: Slovenci dolaze u <U+201C>grad koji ne spava<U+201D>]</ref><ref name="hrvati">[http://www.vecernji-list.hr/newsroom/news/international/453911/print.do;jsessionid=889A73725B957E5D93A2063D490A6E5F.2 Ve<U+010D>ernji list: U Beograd na vikend-zabavu]</ref>

===Architecture===

{{seealso|Religious architecture in Belgrade|Architectural projects under construction in Belgrade|List of notable buildings in Belgrade|List of notable streets and squares in Belgrade}}

Various parts of Belgrade have wildly varying [[architecture]], from the centre of [[Zemun]], which is that typical of a [[Central Europe]]an town, from the few still remaining Turkish-styled buildings located throughout the city, to the more modern architecture and spacious layout of [[Novi Beograd|New Belgrade]]. The 19th century architecture of much of the city was heavily influenced by architectural trends in the then neighbouring empire of [[Austria-Hungary]]. Under [[communism]], much housing was built quickly and cheaply to house the huge influx of people from the countryside following the Second World War, resulting in the [[brutalist architecture]] of the [[blokovi]] (blocks) of New Belgrade.

The city's Main Railway Station connects Belgrade with other European capitals, as well as with many of towns in Serbia. However, more popular in Serbia is travel by coach, and the capital is well served with daily connections to all major and minor towns in the country, as well as in the region. The motorway system provides for easy access by car to [[Novi Sad]] to the north, [[Ni<U+0161>]] to the south, and [[Zagreb]], the capital of Croatia, to the west. As a city situated at the confluence of two major rivers, the Danube and the Sava, Belgrade has many bridges - the two main ones are ''Branko's Bridge'' and the ''Gazela'', both of which connect the core of the city to New Belgrade. The [[Port of Belgrade]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''<U+041B><U+0443><U+043A><U+0430> "<U+0411><U+0435><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0434>"'' or ''Luka "Beograd"'') is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river.<ref>[http://www.port-bgd.co.yu/sr/istorijat.htm <U+041B><U+0443><U+043A><U+0430> "<U+0411><U+0435><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0434>" - <U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0458><U+0430><U+0442> <U+0438> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0436><U+0430><U+0458>]</ref> The city is served by [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport]] ([[IATA airport code|IATA]]: '''BEG'''), a few kilometres west of the city centre. At its peak in 1986, almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.vazduhoplovnivodic.co.yu/sr/letelista.htm <U+0412><U+0430><U+0437><U+0434><U+0443><U+0445><U+043E><U+043F><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0438> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0434><U+0438><U+0447> - <U+0410><U+0435><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+043C> "<U+0411><U+0435><U+043E><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0434>"]</ref> Following growth since 2000, the number of passengers reached about 2 million in 2004 and 2005.<ref>[http://www.danas.co.yu/20050520/ekonomija1.html <U+0414><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0441> - <U+0420><U+0435><U+0433><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0430><U+043B><U+043D><U+0438> <U+0446><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0430><U+0440> <U+043F><U+0443><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+0447><U+043A><U+043E><U+0433> <U+0438> <U+043A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0441><U+0430><U+043E><U+0431><U+0440><U+0430><U+045B><U+0430><U+0458><U+0430>], 20 May 2005</ref> In 2006, 2 million passengers passed through the airport by mid-November.<ref>[http://www.beg.aero/code/navigate.php?Id=63Belgrade "Nikola Tesla" Airport received its two millionth passenger ]</ref>
