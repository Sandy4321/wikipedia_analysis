'''Cory Gibbs''' (born [[January 14]], [[1980]] in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[soccer]] player, who currently plays central [[defender (football)|defender]] for [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in the [[FA Premier League]].

Gibbs played [[college soccer]] at [[Brown University]], joining the team in [[1997]]. During his career Brown won three Ivy League Championships and participated in the NCAA Tournament all four years. In [[2000]], Gibbs led Brown to an [[Ivy League]] championship and the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. He was named Ivy League Player of the Year, and a [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|First-Team All-American]]. He was also one of three Brown soccer players, including Matt Cross (Kansas City) and Scott Powers (Columbus), to be drafted in the 2001 MLS superdraft.

After graduating from Brown in [[2001]], Gibbs decided not to play in the MLS and joined [[FC St. Pauli]] of the [[Bundesliga (football)|Bundesliga]]. He played 25 games for St. Pauli that season, becoming the youngest American to score a goal in the Bundesliga with a goal against [[1. FC K<U+00F6>ln|FC Cologne]]. St. Pauli was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after the 2001-02 season, and Gibbs played an equally important role with the team in his second season as in his first. St. Pauli, however, was relegated again after the 2002-03 season, this time to the [[Regionalliga Nord]], the German third division. Gibbs remained with the team, being moved from central defense to [[defensive midfielder]]. 

Gibbs decided to leave St. Pauli during 2003 due to the low level of play and lack of exposure needed to secure a spot on the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]]. After a move to [[Jahn Regensburg]] of the 2. Bundesliga fell through, Gibbs decided to return to the [[United States]] and play in [[Major League Soccer]], where he would be easily visible and available for international matches. Although the [[Columbus Crew]] initially tried to acquire Gibbs, he eventually ended up with the [[FC Dallas|Dallas Burn]], a team coming off one of the worst seasons in league history. In his stint with Dallas, Gibbs was a starter in every game that he was available for.

Gibbs's return to the U.S. helped his national team career, as he has received frequent callups for {{wc|}} [[2006 FIFA World Cup (qualification CONCACAF)|Qualifiers]]. Gibbs solidified his position as one of USA's top central defenders. Since making his first full international appearance [[June 8]], [[2003]], in the [[Confederations Cup 2003|2003 Confederations Cup]] against [[New Zealand national soccer team|New Zealand]], Gibbs has received 19 [[cap (football)|caps]].

On [[January 20]], [[2005]], Dutch giants [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] agreed on a transfer with MLS, and Gibbs signed a 4<U+00BD>-year contract with the club. In his first season, he made 15 appearances and scored one goal. 

After injuring his knee in a U.S. national team friendly against [[England national football team|England]] on [[May 28]], [[2005]], Gibbs rehabbed (under the direction of Dr. Daniel Kalbac in Miami, Florida) and came back from his injury on [[January 19]], [[2006]]. On [[January 24]], [[2006]], Feyenoord loaned Gibbs to [[ADO Den Haag]] for the remainder of the season. 

Gibbs signed a pre contract agreement with English [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] side Charlton Athletic in May 2006 despite the fact that the club were without a manager at the time.

Gibbs was initially a part of the 2006 United States [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup Team]], but reinjured his right knee in a friendly with Morocco on [[23 May]], [[2006]] and was replaced by [[Gregg Berhalter]]. Following surgery to repair cartilage in his knee, Gibbs is expected to be out until November.
