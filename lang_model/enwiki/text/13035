'''Professor Peter J. Barnes''', MA, [[Doctor of Medicine|DM]], [[Doctor of Science|DSc]], [[Royal College of Physicians|FRCP]], [[American College of Chest Physicians|FCCP]], [[Academy of Medical Sciences|FMedSci]], [[Royal Society|FRS]] (born October 29, 1946) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Pulmonary scientist|respiratory scientist]] and [[clinician]], internationally recognized for his research into the mechanisms and treatment of [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=z5PuQ_0AAAAJ&hl=en/|title=Peter Barnes|work=Google scholar|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}</ref> He is currently Professor of Thoracic Medicine at the National Heart & Lung Institute,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/p.j.barnes.html|title=Curriculum vitae}}</ref> Head of Respiratory Medicine at [[Imperial College]] and Honorary Consultant Physician at the [[Royal Brompton Hospital]] London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbht.nhs.uk/healthprofessionals/consultants/barnes/|title=Professor Peter Barnes|work=For healthcare professionals|publisher=Royal Brompton Hopsital|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Peter Barnes was born in [[Birmingham]] and went to school at [[Leamington College]]. He won an Open Scholarship to [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's College]] [[University of Cambridge]] where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Natural Sciences (first-class honours) in 1969. He moved to the Clincal School [[University of Oxford]] where he was a Scholar and graduated [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|BM, BCh]] in 1972.

==Medical career==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
After qualifying in medicine in 1972, Barnes undertook early clinical training at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] Oxford, followed by training posts in London at [[Brompton Hospital]], [[National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery|Queen Square]] and [[University College Hospital|UCH]]. In 1978 he moved to the [[Royal Postgraduate Medical School]] to undertake research in respiratory pharmacology (particularly [[asthma]]) and was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine]](DM) from the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1981 he spent a year continuing this research at the Cardiovascular Research Institute [[University of California San Francisco|UCSF]] Medical Center. Returning to London, he worked as a Senior Registrar at [[Hammersmith Hospital]] and in 1982 was appointed as Consultant Physician and Clinical Senior Lecturer at [[Royal Postgraduate Medical School|RPMS]]. He then took up the newly created Chair of Clinical Pharmacology at the NHLI in 1985, which was subsequently incorporated as a postgraduate institute into [[Imperial College]] and became an Honorary Consultant Physician at [[Royal Brompton Hospital]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbht.nhs.uk/healthprofessionals/consultants/barnes/|title=Professor Peter Barnes|work=For healthcare professionals|publisher=Royal Brompton Hopsital|accessdate=December 7, 2012}}</ref>

. In 1987 he was appointed to the established Chair of Thoracic Medicine at NHLI and became Head of Respiratory Medicine at [[Imperial College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/p.j.barnes.html|title=Curriculum vitae}}</ref>

==Research==
His research initially focussed on adrenergic regulation of the airways, the role of endogenous [[catecholamines]] (particularly [[adrenaline|epinephrine]]), [[adrenergic receptors]] and the role of [[cholinergic]] neural mechanisms in [[asthma]]. He was the first to map the distribution of receptors in the lung using [[radioligand]] [[autoradiography]].<ref>Barnes PJ, Basbaum CB, Nadel JA, Roberts JM. Localization of <U+00DF>-adrenoceptors in mammalian lung by light microscopic autoradiography. Nature 1982; 299:444-447. PMID 6289123</ref> His group investigated the role of [[neuropeptides]] in [[asthma]] and he proposed the [[axon reflex]] mechanism of [[asthma]]<ref>Barnes PJ. Asthma as an axon reflex. Lancet 1986;i:242-245.PMID 2418322</ref>  Their investigation into the role of inflammatory mechanisms in asthma and the role of [[inflammatory mediators]], lead to an understanding of how [[transcription factors]], such as [[nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B|NF-<U+03BA>B]], regulate the expression of multiple inflammatory genes in the airways and how [[glucocorticosteroids]] suppress inflammation by switching off these transcriptional mechanisms.<ref>Barnes PJ, Karin M. Nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B: a pivotal transcription factor in chronic inflammatory diseases. N Engl J Med 1997;336:1066-1071.PMID 9091804</ref> His research explored mechanisms of severe asthma and in particular steroid-resistance in asthma, identifying several molecular mechanisms. He also investigated how <U+03B2><sub>2</sub>-agonists and corticosteroids interact as these are the most commonly used drug therapies for asthma. His research group has also investigated inflammatory mechanisms in [[COPD]], using the same approaches that had been used in asthma.<ref>Barnes P. J. "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease". ''New Engl J Med'' 2000;343:269-280</ref>  An important achievement was to elucidate the molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticosteroids in asthma through the recruitment of [[histone deacetylase 2]](HDAC2) to activated inflammatory genes, thereby reversing the histone acetylation that is involved in inflammatory gene activation.<ref>Ito K, Barnes P J, Adcock I M. "Glucocorticoid receptor recruitment of histone deacetylase 2 inhibits IL-1<U+03B2>-induced histone H4 acetylation on lysines 8 and 12". ''Mol Cell Biol'',   2000:20:6891-6903 PMID 10958685</ref>  His research also investigated why glucocorticosteroids are ineffective in suppressing inflammation in COPD, demonstrating that this is due to decreased activity and expression of [[HDAC2]]<ref>Ito K, Ito M, Elliott W M, Cosio B, Caramori G, Kon O M, Barczyk A, Hayashi M, Adcock I M, Hogg J C, Barnes P J. "Decreased histone deacetylase activity and severity of chronic obstuctive pulmonary disease". ''New Engl J Med'', 2005;352:1967-1976. PMID 15860753</ref> as a result of [[oxidative stress]] through tyrosine nitration and [[phosphorylation]] via [[phosphoinositide-3-kinase|PI3K]]-<U+03B4>. He also showed that [[theophylline]] was able to restore HDAC2 and reverse steroid resistance in COPD by selectively inhibiting oxidant-activated PI3K<U+03B4>.<ref>To M, Ito K, Kizawa Y, Failla M, Ito M, Kusama T, Elliot M, Hogg J C, Adcock I M, Barnes P J. "Targeting phosphoinositide-3-kinase-<U+03B4> with theophylline reverses corticosteroid insensitivity in COPD". ''Am J Resp Crit Care Med'' 2010;182:897-904. PMID 20224070</ref>  He also pioneered the use of non-invasive markers to monitor inflammation in the airways and particularly exhaled nitric oxide, which is increased in asthma and reduced by steroid therapy.<ref>Kharitonov S A, Yates D, Robbins R A, Logan-Sinclair R, Shinebourne E, Barnes P J. "Increased nitric oxide in exhaled air of asthmatic patients". ''Lancet'' 1994;343:133-135. PMID 7904001</ref>  His research has had a major impact on current understanding of asthma and COPD mechanisms and how current therapies for these diseases work. This has identified several novel targets for therapy.

As a result of his research on steroid-resistance he co-founded (together with Garth Rapeport and Kazuhiro Ito) a [[spin-out]] company within [[Imperial College]] called RespiVert in 2007,<ref>http://www.respivert.com/</ref> which has discovered novel inhaled therapies that are now in clinical development for treatment of severe asthma and COPD since the company was acquired by [[Johnson & Johnson]] in 2010.<ref>http://www.pharmatimes.com/Article/10-06-01/J_J_buys_UK_biotech_RespiVert.aspx</ref>

==Publications==
Barnes is the author of over 1,000 publications in peer reviewed journals<ref>http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/p.j.barnes/publications/ Publication List</ref> and is one of the most highly cited scientists in the world.<ref>http://highlycited.com/</ref> He has edited or co-edited over 50 books on asthma, COPD and respiratory pharmacology.

==Family life==
He married Olivia Harvard-Watts, a [[psychotherapist]], in 1976 and they have 3 sons: Adam (born 1978), Toby (born 1983) and Julian (born 1988).<ref>http://www.ukwhoswho.com/public/home.html</ref>
