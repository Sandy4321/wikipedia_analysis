The [[Inuit]] live across the northern sections of [[Canada]], especially in [[Nunavut]], [[Nunavik]], [[Nunatsiavut]] and [[Northwest Territories]], as well as in [[Alaska]] and [[Greenland]].  Traditional '''Inuit music''' has been based around [[drums]] used in dance music as far back as can be known, and a vocal style called [[Inuit throat singing|katajjaq]] has become of interest in Canada and abroad.

Traditionally [[Inuktitut]] did not have a word for what a European-influenced listener or ethnomusicologist's understanding of ''music'', "and ethnographic investigation seems to suggest that the ''concept'' of music as such is also absent from their culture." The closest word, ''nipi'' {{ref_label | nipi | 1 | b}}, includes music, the sound of speech, and noise. (Nattiez 1990:56)

Until the advent of commercial recording technology, Inuit music was usually used in spiritual ceremonies to ask the spirits (see [[Inuit mythology]]) for good luck in [[hunting]] or [[gambling]], as well as simple [[lullaby|lullabies]].  Inuit music has long been noted for a stoic lack of [[work songs|work]] or [[love song]]s.  These musical beginnings were modified with the arrival of [[Europe]]an sailors, especially from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].  Instruments like the [[accordion]] were popularized, and dances like the [[jig]] or [[reel (dance)|reel]] became common.  [[Scots-Irish]] derived [[United States|American]] [[country music]] has been especially popular among Inuit in the [[20th century]].

Nettl (1956, p.107) list the following characteristics of Inuit music: recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.

The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] has been [[broadcasting]] music in Inuit communities since [[1961]], when [[CFFB (AM)|CFFB]] was opened in [[Iqaluit|Frobisher Bay]], Northwest Territories.  [[Charlie Panigoniak]] was the best-known of the early Inuit recording stars, and he remains a popular [[guitarist]].  The most famous Inuit performers, however, are [[Susan Aglukark]] and [[Tanya Tagaq Gillis]].  In Greenland, there is an Inuit [[hip hop music|hip hop]] crew called [[Nuuk Posse]], which formed in [[1985]] and raps in the [[Kalaallisut language]].[http://www.milkycat.com/reviews/nuukrvw.html]

==Katajjaq==
[[Inuit throat singing|Katajjaq]] (also pirkusirtuk and nipaquhiit) is a type of traditional competitive song, considered a game, usually held between two women.  It is one of the world's few examples of [[throat-singing]], a unique method of producing sounds that is otherwise best-known in [[Tuvan throat-singing]].  When competing, two women stand face-to-face and sing using a complex method of following each other, thus that one voice hits a strong accent while the other hits a weak, melding the two voices into a nearly indistinguishable single sound.  They repeat brief motifs at staggered intervals, often imitating the sounds of [[goose|geese]], [[caribou]] or other wildlife, until one runs out of breath, trips over her own tongue, or begins laughing, and the contest is then over. "The old woman who teaches the children corrects sloppy intonation of contours, poorly meshed phase displacements, and vague rhythms exactly like a Western vocal coach." (Nattiez 1990:57)
