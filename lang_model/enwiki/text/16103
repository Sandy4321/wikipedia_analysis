'''North Texas Regional Airport''' / '''Perrin Field'''<ref name="Airport" /> {{airport codes|PNX|KGYI|GYI}} is a county-owned public use [[airport]] in [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson County]], [[Texas]], [[United States]]. It is located between the cities of [[Sherman, Texas|Sherman]] and [[Denison, Texas|Denison]].<ref name="FAA" /> Formerly known as '''Grayson County Airport''', the airport was renamed in November 2007.<ref name="Airport" /> It is used entirely for general aviation purposes.  Several of the buildings are occupied by businesses, Grayson County government agencies, as well as [[Grayson County College]].

Although most U.S. airports use the same three-letter [[location identifier]] for the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]], this airport is assigned '''GYI''' by the FAA and '''PNX''' by the IATA<ref>[http://gc.kls2.com/airport/PNX Great Circle Mapper: PNX / KGYI - Sherman/Denison, Texas - Grayson County Airport]</ref> (which assigned '''GYI''' to an airport in [[Gisenyi]], [[Rwanda]]<ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/airport/airport.php?id=GYI Aviation Safety Network: GYI / HRYG - Gisenyi Airport, Rwanda]</ref>).

As a general aviation reliever airport, unconfirmed reports suggest that the airport might potentially (in the distant future) serve as a third airport for the [[Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex]] to handle travelers from its growing northern suburbs.  If this occurs, commercial traffic would be focused on regional jet airline operations.  A planned extension of [[Texas State Highway 289|State Highway 289]] would pass the airport on the west side.

== History ==
{{For|usage of airport before 1971|Perrin Air Force Base}}
The airport is located on the site of the former '''Perrin Air Force Base''', which was built in 1941 and closed in 1971.<ref>[http://www.northtexasregionalairport.com/content/?page=18 North Texas Regional Airport: History]</ref> Since the closure, a small group of local Sherman and Denison citizens have held the memory of Perrin together, hosting nine Perrin Field reunions since the early 1980s. The Perrin AFB Research Foundation was established in 1998.  Today, in addition to serving as a general aviation airport, several businesses, as well as a juvenile detention center/boot-camp and adult probation center are built upon former barracks and nearby areas.  There is a small museum dedicated to the former Perrin Air Force Base at the airport and [[Grayson County College]] uses several of the buildings for its course offerings.  The college also operates the former base [[golf course]].

After seeing the fighters take off from here, a young [[Chesley Sullenberger]] became interested in flying.<ref name="nyt">{{Cite news|last=Rivera|first=Ray|title=A Pilot Becomes a Hero Years in the Making|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 16, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/nyregion/17pilot.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&hp|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref name="aarp">{{cite web|last=Kaufmann|first=Carol|title=Hudson River Hero|work=AARP Today|publisher=American Association of Retired Persons|date=January 16, 2009|url=http://bulletin.aarp.org/yourworld/gettingaround/articles/hudson_river_hero.html|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}</ref>

== Facilities and aircraft ==
The airport covers an area of {{convert|1,410|acre|ha|lk=on}} at an [[elevation]] of 749 feet (228 m) above [[mean sea level]]. It has two [[runway]]s: 17L/35R is 9,000 by 150 feet (2,743 x 46 m) with an asphalt/concrete surface; 13/31 is 2,277 by 60 feet (694 x 18 m) with an asphalt surface.<ref name="FAA" />

It originally had three runways, but one 8,000'(2,438m) runway is closed and is used solely as a [[taxiway]]. The airport has an operational Category I [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) to Runway 17L.  The former USAF control tower resumed operations in mid-2008.

For the 12-month period ending April 30, 2007, the airport had 53,300 aircraft operations, an average of 146 per day: 98% [[general aviation]], 2% [[military aviation|military]] and <1% [[air taxi]]. At that time there were 169 aircraft based at this airport: 73% single-[[aircraft engine|engine]], 11% multi-engine, 11% [[jet aircraft|jet]], 4% [[helicopter]] and 1% [[ultralight]].<ref name="FAA" />
