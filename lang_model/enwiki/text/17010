'''Cetirizine hydrochloride'''  ({{pronEng|s<U+025B><U+02C8>t<U+026A>r<U+0268>zi<U+02D0>n}}), an [[antihistamine]], is a major [[metabolite]] of [[hydroxyzine]], and a [[racemic]] [[histamine H1 receptor|selective H<sub>1</sub> receptor]] [[inverse agonist]] used in the treatment of [[allergies]], [[hay fever]], [[angioedema]], and [[urticaria]]. The structural similarity of cetirizine to [[hydroxyzine]], and its derivation from [[piperazine]], attribute  similar [[adverse drug reaction|adverse reactions]] and properties to other piperazine derivatives.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Formerly prescription-only in the US and Canada, cetirizine is now available [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] in both countries as '''Zyrtec''' and '''Reactine''' respectively. Zyrtec was the top new non-food product of 2008 in the US, generating sales of $315.9 million.<ref>{{cite news |first= Stuart|last= Elliott|coauthors= |title=A Strategy When Times Are Tough: "It's New!" |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/business/media/25adco.html |work= |page= |newspaper= [[The New York Times]]|date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=26 March 2009 |quote= }}</ref> It is also available as a [[generic drug]]. In Australia, Zyrtec is available over-the-counter in pharmacies and in the UK cetirizine can be sold in limited quantities off-the-shelf in any outlet and is often available in supermarkets. In India, '''Zyrtec''' and '''Cetzine''' are popular antihistamines and are available without prescription.

Cetirizine crosses the [[blood-brain barrier]] only slightly, eliminating the sedative side-effect common with older antihistamines; however it still causes mild drowsiness.<ref name="blood-brain">

}} </ref> [[Cetirizine]] contains L and D [[stereoisomer]]s.  Chemically, [[levocetirizine]] is the active L [[enantiomer]] of cetirizine. In a recent study of airway epithelial cells the following was observed: Levocetirizine inhibits the production of intercellular adhesion molecule [[ICAM-1]] and secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, which may have beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic changes related to human rhinovirus ([[rhinovirus |HRV]]) infection. Levocetirizine treatment inhibited the HRV-induced increase in ICAM-1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as the HRV-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA and protein levels. Viral titer, as measured by culture in MRC-5 cells, was reduced by levocetirizine. Levocetirizine treatment also reduced the increased nuclear factor-kappa B ([[NF-<U+03BA>B]]) expression seen with HRV infection. Levocetirizine inhibited the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 ([[TLR 3|TLR3]]) mRNA and protein levels. These findings indicate that, in HNEC and [[A549 cell|A549]] cells, levocetirizine inhibits HRV replication and HRV-induced upregulation of ICAM-1, IL-6, and IL-8, TLR3 expression and NF-<U+03BA>B activation. The results of this study suggest that levocetirizine may have a possible clinical application in the treatment of airway inflammation caused by HRV infection.<ref name="pmid19110001">

=== Kimura's disease ===
Cetirizine is an effective agent in treating the symptoms of [[Kimura's disease]], which mostly occurs in young Asian men, affecting the lymph nodes and soft tissue of the head and neck in the form of tumor-like lesions. Cetirizine's properties of being effective  both in the treatment of [[pruritus]] (itching) and as an anti-inflammatory agent make it suitable for the treatment of the pruritus associated with these lesions.<ref name="kimura">
