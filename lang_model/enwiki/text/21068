'''U.S. Route&nbsp;4''' ('''US&nbsp;4''') is a part of the [[U.S. Highway System]] that runs from [[East Greenbush, New York]], to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]], US&nbsp;4 extends {{convert|79.75|mi|2}} from an intersection with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]] in East Greenbush to the [[Vermont]] state line northeast of [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall]]. While the remainder of US&nbsp;4 east of New York is an east<U+2013>west route, US&nbsp;4 in New York is signed north<U+2013>south due to the alignment the route takes through the state. The portion of the route between [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]] and Whitehall is part of the [[Lakes to Locks Passage]], an [[All-American Road]].

The route runs along the [[Hudson River]] from Troy to [[Hudson Falls, New York|Hudson Falls]] and the [[Champlain Canal]] from [[Fort Ann (village), New York|Fort Ann]] to [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall]]. It passes through several riverside and canalside communities, including two cities (Troy and [[Mechanicville, New York|Mechanicville]]) and seven villages. US&nbsp;4 crosses several major east<U+2013>west highways as it proceeds north, such as [[Interstate 90 (New York)|Interstate&nbsp;90]] (I-90) in East Greenbush, [[New York State Route&nbsp;7]] (NY&nbsp;7) in Troy, [[New York State Route 29|NY&nbsp;29]] in [[Schuylerville, New York|Schuylerville]], and [[New York State Route 149|NY&nbsp;149]] in Fort Ann. It also [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s with the north<U+2013>south [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] for {{convert|6|mi|0}} from [[Comstock, New York|Comstock]] to Whitehall and with [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]] for a total of {{convert|16|mi|0}} between Waterford and Bemis Heights and from Schuylerville to [[Northumberland, New York|Northumberland]].

US&nbsp;4 was assigned in 1926 and initially extended from [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]] to the Vermont border near Whitehall by way of Hudson Falls. The route utilized part of [[New York State Route 6 (1924<U+2013>1927)|NY&nbsp;6]] and [[New York State Route 30 (1924<U+2013>1930)|NY&nbsp;30]], two highways assigned in 1924. US&nbsp;4 was extended southward to its present terminus in East Greenbush as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]]. Much of US&nbsp;4 south of Hudson Falls initially [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped with other routes; most of the overlaps were gradually eliminated during the 1940s and 1950s as the concurrent routes were eliminated or truncated. At one time, US&nbsp;4 overlapped with NY&nbsp;32 from Waterford to Northumberland with no interruption in between. The concurrency was split into two shorter overlaps when US&nbsp;4 was realigned in the 1950s to follow its current alignment between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville.

==Route description==
[[Image:US4WesternBegin.jpg|left|thumb|US&nbsp;4 begins here at US&nbsp;9 and US&nbsp;20 in East Greenbush.]]
The portion of US&nbsp;4 between [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]] in [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]] and [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] in [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall]] is the southernmost part of the [[Lakes to Locks Passage]], an [[All-American Road]] that begins in Waterford and heads north through eastern [[New York]] to [[Rouses Point, New York|Rouses Point]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/repository/2009%20tour-bk.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Description of Highway Touring Routes, Bicycling Touring Routes, Scenic Byways, & Commemorative/Memorial Designations in New York State |author=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |month=January |year=2009 |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref> Additionally, the segment of US&nbsp;4 between the northern city line of [[Mechanicville, New York|Mechanicville]] and the eastern village line of Whitehall is designated as the Turning Point Trail.<ref>{{cite web |author=[[New York State Legislature]] |url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYTYPE=LAWS+&QUERYDATA=$$HAY342-DD$$@TXHAY0342-DD+&LIST=LAW+&TARGET=VIEW |title=New York State Highway Law <U+00A7> 342-DD |accessdate=May 30, 2010}}</ref>

===East Greenbush to Schuylerville===
US&nbsp;4 begins at the concurrency of [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]] in [[East Greenbush (CDP), New York|East Greenbush]]. Heading northward, it has an interchange with [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]], continuing northward into [[Troy, New York|Troy]]. In Troy, it passes by [[Hudson Valley Community College]] as well as the headquarters of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]]. US&nbsp;4 then heads downhill, passing the historic [[South End Tavern]] as Burden Avenue, named for the historic [[Burden Iron Works]]. Later, US&nbsp;4 assumes Fourth Street, which splits into parallel one-way streets (Third Street handles southbound traffic from downtown). At Congress Street, in the middle of the [[Central Troy Historic District]] with [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Troy, New York)|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] on the corner, it intersects [[New York State Route 2|NY&nbsp;2]]. Once through downtown, the streets meet and pass by the [[Green Island Bridge]], later passing under the [[Collar City Bridge]] and into [[Lansingburgh, New York|Lansingburgh]].<ref name="nymap07">{{cite map |title=1977<U+2013>2007 I Love New York State Map |year=2007 |publisher=[[I Love New York]]}}</ref>

After Lansingburgh, US&nbsp;4 turns left to cross the [[Hudson River]] on the [[Troy<U+2013>Waterford Bridge]], entering [[Waterford (village), New York|Waterford]], joining with [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]] to head north together west of the Hudson. After [[Mechanicville, New York|Mechanicville]], US&nbsp;4 and NY&nbsp;32 split, and US&nbsp;4 passes by the [[Saratoga Battlefield]] and the [[Gerald B. H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery|Saratoga National Cemetery]]. NY&nbsp;32 joins again to pass through [[Schuylerville, New York|Schuylerville]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

===Schuylerville to Vermont line===
Route&nbsp;4 begins to run along the [[Champlain Canal]] after Schuylerville, passing through the hamlets of Northumberland and Starks Knob. At a crossing over the Hudson River, Routes&nbsp;4 and the concurrent Route&nbsp;32 split in different directions. Route&nbsp;4, which is now on the other side of the Hudson, continues northward through Fort Miller, and crosses the River once more. The route then enters [[Fort Edward, New York|Fort Edward]], where it becomes concurrent with [[New York State Route 197|NY&nbsp;197]].<ref name="nymap07"/>

[[File:US 4 in Troy NY.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;4 northbound at 106th Street in Troy. At left is the Hudson River, which US&nbsp;4 follows from Troy to Hudson Falls.]]
With the Hudson River to its west, Route&nbsp;4 heads northward once again, leaving Route&nbsp;197 behind. Not far after Fort Edward, the highway enters [[Hudson Falls, New York|Hudson Falls]], where it turns into a local road. There, it heads through downtown, intersecting with [[New York State Route 196|NY&nbsp;196]], and soon afterwards, [[New York State Route 254|NY&nbsp;254]]. Route&nbsp;4 makes a sudden curve to the northeast, heading through the rural regions for the rest of its length.<ref name="nymap07"/>

There is one final intersection with Route&nbsp;32, but they do not become concurrent and Route&nbsp;4 heads to the northeast. The route passes through Kingsbury and soon after, becomes concurrent with [[New York State Route 149|NY&nbsp;149]]. The two routes head into [[Fort Ann (village), New York|Fort Ann]], where they split, with Route&nbsp;149 heading westward. After passing Battle Hill, Route&nbsp;22 merges in from [[Comstock, New York|Comstock]]. There are several hills before the intersection where the two roads split in [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall]]. Route&nbsp;4 continues along its final stretch after Route&nbsp;22, passing fields and such to the state line, where it continues into Vermont.<ref name="nymap07"/>

==History==
===Origins and assignment===
In 1911, the [[New York State Legislature]] created Route&nbsp;43, an unsigned [[legislative route]] extending from the southern village line of [[Stillwater (village), New York|Stillwater]] to the western village line of [[Schuylerville, New York|Schuylerville]] via the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Quaker Springs.<ref name="1918book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ffqwAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA73 |author=New York State Legislature |title=Laws of the State of New York passed at the One Hundred and Forty-First Session of the Legislature |chapter=Tables of Laws and Codes Amended or Repealed |year=1918 |publisher=J.

At the same time, Route&nbsp;44 was extended southwest from Stillwater to [[Clifton Park, New York|Clifton Park]] via [[Mechanicville, New York|Mechanicville]] and west from Schuylerville to [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga Springs]].<ref name="1921book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6pE4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA42 |author=New York State Legislature |title=Laws of the State of New York passed at the One Hundred and Forty-Fourth Session of the Legislature |chapter=Tables of Laws and Codes Amended or Repealed |year=1921 |publisher=J.

The first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. Two of the routes assigned at this time were [[New York State Route 6 (1924<U+2013>1927)|NY&nbsp;6]], a north<U+2013>south route extending from the [[New York City]] line to the [[Canada <U+2013> United States border|Canadian border]], and [[New York State Route 30 (1924<U+2013>1930)|NY&nbsp;30]], another north<U+2013>south route connecting NY&nbsp;6 in [[Mechanicville, New York|Mechanicville]] to the [[Vermont]] state line west of [[Fair Haven, Vermont|Fair Haven]].<ref>{{cite news |title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 21, 1924 |page=XX9}}</ref> NY&nbsp;6 left [[Albany, New York|Albany]] on modern [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]] and followed it to Mechanicville, where NY&nbsp;6 veered westward on what is now [[New York State Route 67|NY&nbsp;67]] and NY&nbsp;30 picked up the current alignment of NY&nbsp;32. NY&nbsp;30 continued north on modern NY&nbsp;32 to [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]], at which point it went east to [[Hudson Falls, New York|Hudson Falls]] via Warren and River Streets. It headed northward from there to Vermont on modern US&nbsp;4. From Mechanicville to Schuylerville, NY&nbsp;30 utilized the alignment of legislative Route&nbsp;44. By 1926, NY&nbsp;30 was rerouted north of [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall]] to continue north toward the Canadian border. The old alignment of NY&nbsp;30 between Whitehall and Vermont was not assigned a new number. Meanwhile, an alternate route of NY&nbsp;6 on the east side of the [[Hudson River]] between [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] (now [[U.S. Route 20 (New York)|US&nbsp;20]]) in [[East Greenbush, New York|East Greenbush]] and NY&nbsp;6 in [[Waterford, New York|Waterford]] was designated as NY&nbsp;6B by 1926.<ref>{{cite map |title=Official Map Showing State Highways and other important roads |year=1926 |publisher=[[State of New York Department of Public Works]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref>

[[File:Entering New York on US 4.jpg|thumb|left|Entering New York on US&nbsp;4 southbound]]
In the original plans for the [[U.S. Highway System]], the north<U+2013>south highway along the western bank of the Hudson River was designated as [[U.S. Route 9 (New York)|US&nbsp;9]] while the highway on the eastern bank was assigned [[U.S. Route 109|US&nbsp;109]]. The two routes were concurrent from Albany to Mechanicville, where US&nbsp;9 went west to follow NY&nbsp;6 while US&nbsp;109 continued north on NY&nbsp;30. The designations met again south of Glens Falls, where US&nbsp;109 ended at US&nbsp;9. Also in the original plans was US&nbsp;4, which was assigned to all of NY&nbsp;30's original alignment between Glens Falls and the Vermont state line.<ref name="1926map2">{{cite map |url=http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/Midatlantic/NewYork/unitedstates1926ra_009.html |title=Rand McNally Auto Road Atlas (eastern New York) |publisher=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1926 |accessdate=December 27, 2009}}</ref> In the final system alignment approved on November&nbsp;11, 1926, the routing of US&nbsp;9 was altered to follow its modern alignment between Albany and Glens Falls while US&nbsp;109 was reconfigured to use NY&nbsp;6B between East Greenbush and Waterford.<ref name="1926map1">{{cite map |title=[[:File:1926us.jpg|United States System of Highways]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |date=November 11, 1926}}</ref>

===Southward extension and overlaps===
When U.S. Highways were first posted in New York in 1927, US&nbsp;9 was restored to its originally planned alignment between Albany and Glens Falls (via Waterford and Mechanicville) while the US&nbsp;109 designation went unassigned. The portion of US&nbsp;109's alignment south of Waterford became [[U.S. Route 9E|US&nbsp;9E]] instead. US&nbsp;4 was assigned as planned in 1926, [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ping NY&nbsp;30 between Glens Falls and Whitehall. The NY&nbsp;6 designation was completely removed at this time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Automobile Blue Book |publisher=Automobile Blue Book, Inc |location=Chicago |edition=1927 |year=1927 |volume=1}} This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927.</ref> In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]], US&nbsp;9 was realigned to follow its modern routing between Albany and [[Round Lake, New York|Round Lake]]. The portion of US&nbsp;9's former routing between Waterford and Mechanicville as well as all of US&nbsp;9E north of US&nbsp;20 became a southward extension of US&nbsp;4, which left its original alignment in Hudson Falls and followed a previously unnumbered riverside highway south to [[Northumberland, New York|Northumberland]]. In between Northumberland and Mechanicville, it utilized the former routing of NY&nbsp;30, which was reassigned to [[New York State Route 30|another highway]] as part of the renumbering.<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931).

[[File:US 4-NY 32 split in Northumberland.jpg|thumb|North end of the northern US&nbsp;4&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;32 overlap in Northumberland]]
Virtually all of US&nbsp;4 south of Hudson Falls initially overlapped other routes, all of which were assigned as part of the renumbering. In between Hudson Falls and Northumberland, US&nbsp;4 overlapped [[New York State Route 32B|NY&nbsp;32B]], which began in Glens Falls and followed US&nbsp;4's former routing east to Hudson Falls. From Northumberland to [[Schuylerville, New York|Schuylerville]] and from Bemis Heights to Waterford, US&nbsp;4 was part of [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]]. The segment from Schuylerville to Bemis Heights was designated [[New York State Route 32A (1930 <U+2013> early 1940s)|NY&nbsp;32A]]. Lastly, the part of US&nbsp;4 south of Northern Drive (then-[[New York State Route 40|NY&nbsp;40]]) in [[Troy, New York|Troy]] was concurrent to NY&nbsp;40.<ref name="1930map">{{cite map |title=Road Map of New York |year=1930 |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company of New York]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> By 1932, NY&nbsp;40 was rerouted through Troy to follow a more easterly alignment through the city. The realignment moved the northern end of the overlap southward to the junction of US&nbsp;4 and Winter Street in [[North Greenbush, New York|North Greenbush]].<ref>{{cite map |title=Texaco Road Map <U+2013> New York |publisher=[[Texas Oil Company]] |year=1932 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref>

Most of the overlaps were eliminated as time went on. In the early 1940s, NY&nbsp;32A was reassigned to [[New York State Route 32A|another highway]] in the [[Catskill Mountains]] while NY&nbsp;32B was truncated to end in Hudson Falls. The former routing of NY&nbsp;32A became a realignment of NY&nbsp;32, creating an uninterrupted overlap between US&nbsp;4 and NY&nbsp;32 from Waterford to Northumberland.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York Info-Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil Company]] |year=1940 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Pictorial Guide |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1942 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> In the mid-1950s, work began on a project to upgrade a pre-existing riverside highway between Bemis Heights and Schuylerville.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]] |edition=1955<U+2013>56 |year=1954}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]] |edition=1957 |year=1956}}</ref> The project was completed by 1958, at which time the roadway became part of a realigned US&nbsp;4.<ref name="1958map">{{cite map |title=New York with Special Maps of Putnam<U+2013>Rockland<U+2013>Westchester Counties and Finger Lakes Region |publisher=[[Esso]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]] |edition=1958 |year=1958}}</ref> The overlap with NY&nbsp;40 was eliminated in the late 1950s when NY&nbsp;40 was truncated to begin at the junction of US&nbsp;4 and Winter Street.<ref name="1958map" /><ref>{{cite map |title=New York and New Jersey Tourgide<!--sic--> Map |publisher=[[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]] |year=1960}}</ref>
