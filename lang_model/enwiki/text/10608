On 18 March 2014, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] signed a treaty with representatives of Crimea and Sevastopol to admit them as provisional members of the Russian Federation effective immediately.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/18/world/europe/ukraine-crisis/|agency=CNN|title=Kremlin: Crimea and Sevastopol are now part of Russia, not Ukraine|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=18 March 2014}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Crimea'' derives from the name of the city of Q<U+0131>r<U+0131>m (today's ''[[Stary Krym]]''), which served as a capital of the Crimean province of the [[Golden Horde]]. The name Krim thus traces to the Tatar word for 'steppe, hill' ([[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]]: ''q<U+0131>r<U+0131>m'' - <U+2018>my steppe, hill<U+2019>, from [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]], [[Middle Turkic languages|Middle Turkic]] ''q<U+0131>r'' <U+2018>mountain top, mountain ridge; steppe, desert, level ground<U+2019>).<ref>[http://www.nisanyansozluk.com/?k=k%C4%B1r1&lnk=1 <U+201C>k<U+0131>r<U+201D>] in ''Ni<U+015F>anyan Dictionary'' (Turkish Etymological dictionary)</ref><ref>[http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi?single=1&basename=%2fdata%2falt%2fturcet&text_number=1013&root=config&encoding=utf-eng <U+201C>*K<U+0268>r<U+201D>] in [[Sergei Starostin]], [[Vladimir Dybo]], Oleg Mudrak (2003), ''Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages'', Leiden: Brill Academic Publishers</ref> Russian ''Krym'' is a Russified form of Q<U+0131>r<U+0131>m. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] called Crimea ''[[Tauris]]'' (later ''[[Taurica]]'', <U+03A4><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> in [[Ancient Greek]]), after its inhabitants, the [[Tauri]]. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] accounts for the name by asserting that [[Heracles]] plowed that land using a huge ox ("Taurus"). Herodotus also refers to a nearby region called ''Cremni''<ref>Herodotus IV.20.</ref> or 'the Cliffs{{'"}}, which may also refer to the Crimean peninsula, notable for its cliffs along what is otherwise a flat northern coastline of the Black Sea.

In English, Crimea was often referred to with the [[definite article]], as '''the Crimea''', until well into the 20th century.

==History==
{{main|History of Crimea}}
Formerly annexed by the [[Russian Empire]], Crimea was reoccupied by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1921 and was granted the status of autonomous republic. After the [[World War II]] in 1945 the Soviet authorities [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|deported]] the indigenous population of [[Crimean Tatars]] and the autonomous status of the region was stripped. In 1954, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] the region to Ukraine. Ukraine restored Crimea's [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous status]] in 1991 and allowed all Crimean Tatars to return. Crimea's autonomous status was further reiterated in 1996 with the ratification of Ukraine's [[Constitution of Ukraine|current constitution]], which declared Crimea to be the "Autonomous Republic of Crimea", but also an "inseparable constituent part of Ukraine."<ref name="Wikisource">{{cite web|title=Constitution of Ukraine, 1996|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine,_1996|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>

On March 11, 2014, amidst the [[2014 Crimean crisis]], the [[Supreme Council of Crimea|Crimean parliament]] and the [[Sevastopol]] City Council [[Declaration of Independence of Crimea and Sevastopol|issued a letter of intent]] to [[unilateral declaration of independence|unilaterally declare independence]] from Ukraine.<ref name="KrimRada">{{cite web|title=<U+041F><U+0430><U+0440><U+043B><U+0430><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442> <U+041A><U+0440><U+044B><U+043C><U+0430> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+043D><U+044F><U+043B> <U+0414><U+0435><U+043A><U+043B><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+044E> <U+043E> <U+043D><U+0435><U+0437><U+0430><U+0432><U+0438><U+0441><U+0438><U+043C><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438> <U+0410><U+0420><U+041A> <U+0438> <U+0433>. <U+0421><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+044F>|url=http://www.rada.crimea.ua/news/11_03_2014_1|publisher=<U+0413><U+043E><U+0441><U+0443><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0421><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442> <U+0420><U+0435><U+0441><U+043F><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438> <U+041A><U+0440><U+044B><U+043C>|accessdate=18 March 2014|date=11 March 2014}}</ref> The document specifically mentioned [[Kosovo independence precedent|Kosovo as a precedent]] in the lead part.<ref name="KrimRada" />

The declaration was done in an attempt to legitimize [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|a referendum on the status of Crimea]] where citizens were to vote on whether Crimea should apply to join Russia as a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject of the Russian Federation]], or remain part of Ukraine.

===Referendum===
{{main|Crimean referendum, 2014}}
On March 16, 2014, a large majority (reported as 95% of those who voted) voted in favour of independence of Crimea from Ukraine and joining Russia as a federal subject.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26606097 BBC News - Crimea referendum: Voters 'back Russia union'<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/16/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140316 Crimeans vote over 90 percent to quit Ukraine for Russia | Reuters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The BBC reported that most of the Crimean Tatars that they interviewed were boycotting the vote.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Prime Minister [[Sergey Aksyonov]] stated that 40% of Crimean Tatars took part in the referendum, and according to Russian state media, polling data showed a majority of Tatars in Sevastopol voted to join Russia, with a turnout of over 50% in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=About 40% of Crimean Tatars take part in Crimean referendum <U+2013> Prime Minister|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/world/723832|accessdate=March 16, 2014|newspaper=ITAR-TASS|date=March 16, 2014}}</ref> The [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] condemned the vote as illegal.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/17/ukraine-crisis-japan-idUST9N0M101J20140317 Japan does not recognise Crimea vote - govt spokesman | Reuters<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

After the referendum, Crimean lawmakers formally voted both to secede from Ukraine and ask for membership in the Russian Federation. The Sevastopol City Council, however, requested the port's separate admission as a [[federal cities of Russia|federal city]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/world/europe/european-union-ukraine.html?hpw&rref=world&_r=0|agency=The New York Times|title=Lawmakers in Crimea Move Swiftly to Split From Ukraine|date=17 March 2014|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>

===International recognition===
{{main|International recognition of the Republic of Crimea}}
As of 18 March, only one UN and three non-UN states have recognized the Republic of Crimea's independence: [[Russia]], [[Abkhazia]], [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]], and [[South Ossetia]].

On 18 March 2014, Russia and Crimea have signed treaty of accession of the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol in the Russian Federation following President Putin<U+2019>s address to the Parliament. During the transition period which will last till January 1, 2015, both sides will resolve the issues of integration of the new subjects <U+201C>in the economic, financial, credit and legal system of the Russian Federation.<U+201D><ref name=annexation>{{cite news| url=http://rt.com/news/putin-include-crimea-sevastopol-russia-578/ | work=Russia Today | title=Treaty to accept Crimea, Sevastopol to Russian Federation signed | date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Crimea}}
[[File:Relief map of Crimea.jpg|thumb|Relief map of the Crimean peninsula]] 
Crimea is located on the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]] and on the western coast of the [[Sea of Azov]], bordering [[Kherson Oblast]] from the North. There are two rural communities of [[Henichesk Raion]] in Kherson Oblast that are physically located on the peninsula, on the smaller peninsula [[Arabat Spit]], Shchaslyvtseve and Strilkove. Although located in the southwestern part of the Crimean peninsula, the city of [[Sevastopol]] has a special but separate [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine#Municipalities|municipality status]] within [[Ukraine]]. Crimea's total land area is {{convert|26100|km<U+00B2>|sqmi|sp=us|0|abbr=on}}.

Crimea is connected to the mainland by the {{convert|5|<U+2013>|7|km|mi|sp=us|1}} wide [[Isthmus of Perekop]]. At the eastern tip is the [[Kerch Peninsula]], which is directly opposite the [[Taman Peninsula]] on the Russian mainland. Between the Kerch and Taman peninsulas, lies the {{convert|3|<U+2013>|13|km|mi|sp=us|1}} wide [[Strait of Kerch]], which connects the waters of the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov. The peninsula consists of many other smaller peninsulas such as Arabat Spit, [[Kerch peninsula]], [[Herakles peninsula]], [[Tarhan Qut peninsula]] and many others. Crimea also features other headlands such as [[Cape Priboiny]], [[Cape Tarhan Qut]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Sarych]], [[Nicholas Cape]], [[Cape Fonar]], [[Cape Fiolent]], [[Kazantyp|Qazan Tip]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Cape Aq Burun]], and many others.

Geographically, the peninsula is generally divided into three zones: steppes, mountains and southern coast.

The southeast coast is flanked at a distance of {{convert|8|<U+2013>|12|km|mi|sp=us|1}} from the sea by a parallel range of mountains, the [[Crimean Mountains]].<ref>The [[Crimean Mountains]] may also be referred to as the Yayl<U+00E2> Da<U+011F> or Alpine Meadow Mountains.</ref> These mountains are backed by secondary parallel ranges. Seventy-five percent of the remaining area of Crimea consists of semiarid [[prairie]] lands, a southward continuation of the [[Pontic steppes]], which slope gently to the northwest from the foot of the Crimean Mountains. The main range of these mountains shoots up with extraordinary abruptness from the deep floor of the [[Black Sea]] to an altitude of {{convert|600|<U+2013>|750|m|ft|sp=us|0}}, beginning at the southwest point of the [[peninsula]], called [[Cape Fiolente]]. It was believed that this cape was supposedly crowned with the temple of [[Artemis]], where [[Iphigeneia]] is said to have officiated as priestess.<ref>See the article "Crimea" in the [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].</ref>

[[Uchan-su (waterfall)|Uchan-su]] [[waterfall]] on the south slope of the mountains is the highest in Crimea.

Numerous [[kurgan]]s, or [[burial mound]]s, of the ancient [[Scythia]]ns are scattered across the Crimean steppes.

The terrain that lies beyond the sheltering Crimean Mountain range is of an altogether different character. Here, the narrow strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are smothered with greenery. This "riviera" stretches along the southeast coast from capes [[Cape Fiolente|Fiolente]] and [[Cape Aya|Aya]], in the south, to Feodosiya, and is studded with summer sea-bathing resorts such as [[Alupka]], [[Yalta]], [[Gurzuf]], [[Alushta]], [[Sudak]], and [[Feodosiya]]. During the years of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, the resorts and [[dacha]]s of this coast served as the prime perquisites of the politically loyal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}<sup>why here? and ref?</sup> In addition, vineyards and fruit orchards are located in the region. Fishing, mining, and the production of essential oils are also important. Numerous [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] villages, [[mosque]]s, [[monastery|monasteries]], and [[palace]]s of the Russian imperial family and nobles are found here, as well as picturesque ancient Greek and medieval castles.

The Crimean coastline is broken by several bays and harbors. These harbors lie west of the [[Isthmus of Perekop]] by the [[Bay of Karkinit]]; on the southwest by the open [[Bay of Kalamita]], with the ports of [[Yevpatoria]] and [[Sevastopol]];{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}<sup>(not Sevastopol)</sup> on the north by the [[Bay of Arabat]] of the Isthmus{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}<sup>(nonsense)</sup> of [[Yenikale]] or [[Kerch]]; and on the south by the [[Bay of Caffa]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}<sup>(name?)</sup> or [[Feodosiya]], with the port of Feodosiya. The natural borders between the Crimean peninsula and the Ukrainian mainland serve the saline [[Lake Syvash]] (a unique shallow system of estuaries and bays).

===Climate===
{{must include|section|a table tabulating Crimea's minimum, average, and maximum temperatures and rain fall|date=March 2014}}
Most of Crimea has a temperate continental climate, except for the south coast where it experiences a humid{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} subtropical climate, due to warm influences from the Black Sea. Summers can be hot ({{convert|28|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|disp=or}} Jul average) and winters are cool ({{convert|-0.3|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|disp=or}} Jan average) in the interior, on the south coast winters are milder ({{convert|4|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|disp=or}} Jan average) and temperatures much below freezing are exceptional. Precipitation throughout Crimea is low, averaging only {{convert|400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} a year. Because of its climate, the southern Crimean coast is a popular beach and sun resort for Ukrainian and Russian tourists.

==Government and politics==
{{main|Politics of Crimea}}
The legislative body is a 100-seat parliament, renamed the [[State Council of Crimea]].<ref>http://www.vsarc.ru/en/news/17_03_2014_2</ref>

The executive power is represented by the [[Council of Ministers of Crimea|Council of Ministers]], headed by a [[Chairman of the Supreme Council of Crimea|Chairman]]. The authority and operation of the Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of Crimea are determined by the [[Constitution of Crimea]] and other Crimean laws, as well as by regular decisions carried out by the Council.<ref name = "CMU"/>

Justice is administered by courts.<ref name = "CMU"/>

While not an official body controlling Crimea, the [[Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People]] is a representative body of the Crimean Tatars, which address grievances to the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Crimean parliament]], the Prime Minister, and international bodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0220/p09s02-coop.html |title= A lesson in stifling violent extremism |accessdate=March 26, 2007 |author= |last=Ziad |first=Waleed | coauthors=Laryssa Chomiak |date=February 20, 2007 |work=[[CS Monitor]] }}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
Crimea is subdivided into 26 regions: 14 [[raion]]s ([[district]]s) and 12 city municipalities, officially known as ''territories governed by city councils''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/pls/z7502/A005?rdat1=24.02.2007&rf7571=2 |title=Infobox card&nbsp;<U+2013> Avtonomna Respublika Krym |accessdate=February 23, 2007 |work=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] |language= Ukrainian}}</ref>

===Tourism===
The development of Crimea as a holiday destination began in the second half of the 19th century. The development of the transport networks brought masses of tourists from central parts of [[Russia]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, a major development of palaces, villas, and dachas began<U+2014>most of which remain. These are some of the main attractions of Crimea as a tourist destination. There are many [[Crimean legends]] about famous touristic places, which attract the attention of tourists.

A new phase of tourist development began when the Soviet government realized the potential of the healing quality of the local air, lakes and therapeutic muds. It became a "health" destination for Soviet workers, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet tourists visited Crimea. Nowadays Crimea is more of a get-away destination than a "health-improvement" destination. The most visited areas are the south shore of Crimea with cities of Yalta and Alushta, the western shore - Eupatoria and Saki, and the south-eastern shore - Feodosia and Sudak.

Crimea possesses significant historical and natural resources and is a region where it is possible to find practically any type of landscape; mountain ranges and plateaus, grasslands, caves. Furthermore, Saki poses unique therapeutic mud and Eupatoria has vast empty beaches with the purest quartz sand.<ref name=tourism>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimea.org.ua|title=Crimea Travel Guide|publisher=CrimeaTravel|accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>
