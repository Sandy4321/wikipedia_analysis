The '''''Nassau'' class''' were a group of four German [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built for the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial Navy]]. They were the German response to the introduction of the "all big gun" British [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']].<ref name="Conways145">Gardiner and Gray, p. 145</ref> The class was composed of {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, {{SMS|Rheinland||2}}, {{SMS|Posen||2}}, and {{SMS|Westfalen||2}}. All four ships were laid down in mid-1907, and completed between May and September 1910. Compared to their British contemporaries, the ''Nassau''-class ships were lighter and had a wider [[Beam (nautical)|beam]]. However, they were two knots slower, due to the fact that the German ships retained [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|triple-expansion engines]] as opposed to the high-power turbine engines adopted by the British. The ships also carried smaller main guns<U+2014>11-inch (280&nbsp;mm) guns rather than the 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns mounted on the British ships.<ref>Gardiner and Gray, pp. 144<U+2013>145</ref>

After their commissioning into the German fleet, all four ships served as a unit: the II Division of I&nbsp;Battle Squadron. Two of the ships, ''Nassau'' and ''Posen'', took part in the inconclusive [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in 1915, during which they engaged the Russian [[pre-dreadnought]] ''[[Russian battleship Slava|Slava]]''. The ''Nassau'' class ships took part in the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May and 1 June 1916 as the II&nbsp;Battle Squadron; they suffered only a handful of secondary battery hits and limited casualties. At the end of the [[First World War]], the four ships were seized as war prizes by the victorious Allied powers and sold for scrapping.

==Design==
===Development===
In 1906, the launch of the "all big gun" {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} made all other battleships then in existence obsolete. The First Naval Amendment to the 1900 German [[German Naval Laws|Naval Law]] was passed in 1906 prior to the launch of ''Dreadnought''; Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] had originally requested six new [[battleship]]s and six [[armored cruiser]]s,<ref group=A>[[Pre-dreadnought|Battleships]] of the day carried heavy armor and a main battery of four large-caliber guns, typically 11&nbsp;in (280&nbsp;mm) or larger. [[Armored cruisers]] were smaller, faster ships that carried a thinner armored belt and smaller guns.</ref> along with a number of miscellaneous smaller craft. The launch of the revolutionary ''Dreadnought'' meant that any future battleships that could compete with her would be significantly more expensive than the older [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s. Opposition to budget increases in the [[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]] forced Tirpitz to reduce his request to six armored cruisers<U+2014>one of which was to have been placed in reserve<U+2014>and 48 torpedo boats, dropping his request for new battleships completely; the reduced proposal was voted through on 19 May 1906. However, a week after the amendment was passed, funds for two 18,000-ton battleships and a 15,000-ton armored cruiser were allocated to the Navy. Funds were also provided to widen the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]] and enlarge dock facilities to accommodate the larger ships.<ref name="Conways134">Gardiner and Gray, p. 134</ref>

A debate ensued in the ''Reichsmarineamt'' (Navy Office) over the construction of the new ships. Tirpitz favored following the [[Royal Navy]] by building [[dreadnought battleship]]s and [[battlecruiser]]s as well. Tirpitz saw it as an opportunity to break Britain's commitment to the "two power standard".<ref group=A>Britain had committed to building a navy that was larger than the next two closest rivals combined. See: Gardiner and Gray, p. 134</ref> Tirpitz also intended to use the funds that had been allocated for armored cruisers to build battlecruisers instead, although they were still to be classified as armored cruisers.<ref name="Conways134"/>

''Nassau'' and ''Westfalen'' were the first dreadnoughts ordered under the 1906<U+2013>07 program; the armored cruiser {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher||2}} was ordered along with them.<ref name="Conways145"/><ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 150</ref> The Second Naval Amendment to the 1900 Naval Law was passed on 27 March 1908; this amendment included a budget of 1&nbsp;billion [[German gold mark|marks]], and provisions that reduced the lifespan of battleships from 25&nbsp;years to 20. This had the effect of necessitating the replacement of the [[coastal defense ship]]s of the ''Siegfried'' and ''Oldenburg'' classes, as well as the pre-dreadnoughts of the {{sclass|Brandenburg|battleship|4}}.<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 135</ref> The {{Sclass|Sachsen|armored frigate|2}}s (first put into service in the late 1870s) also needed replacement, as they were already obsolete, even under the 25-year standard. The four ''Sachsen''{{'}}s were to be replaced by the ''Nassau'' class. The second pair of ships in the ''Nassau'' class, ''Posen'' and ''Rheinland'', were ordered under the 1907<U+2013>08 building program.<ref name="Conways145"/>

===General characteristics===
The ships were {{convert|146.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|26.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, and had a draught of {{convert|8.9|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The ships had a length to width ratio of 5.45, which was somewhat "stubby" compared to contemporary designs. To some extent, the greater than normal width was due to the four wing turrets, which necessitated a wider hull.<ref name="Janes">Ireland, p. 30</ref> They displaced 18,570&nbsp;tons with a standard load, and 21,000&nbsp;tons fully laden. The ships had 19 [[watertight compartment]]s, with the exception of ''Nassau'', which only had 16. All four ships had a [[double bottom]] for 88&nbsp;percent of the [[keel]]. The ships carried a number of boats, including a picket boat, 3 admiral's barges, 2 [[Launch (boat)|launches]], 2 [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], and 2 [[Dinghy|dinghies]].<ref name="Groner23">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 23</ref>

As designed, the ships did not handle particularly well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, due to the weight of the wing turrets.<ref>Friedman, p. 63</ref> The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large [[metacentric height]], which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell.<ref>Lyon, pp. 100&ndash;101</ref> [[Bilge keel]]s were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the ''Nassau''-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70&nbsp;percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.<ref name="Groner23"/>

===Propulsion===
Unlike the British ''Dreadnought'', the ships of the ''Nassau'' class retained 3-shaft [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|triple expansion engines]] instead of more advanced [[turbine]] engines.<ref name="Groner23"/> The main artillery layout greatly restricted the space available to the power plant; however, this had the benefit of dividing the machinery into three compartments, which increased survivability.<ref name="Janes"/> Each shaft powered a 3-bladed [[Propeller|screw]] that was 5&nbsp;m (5.46&nbsp;yd) in diameter. The triple expansion engines were rated at 22,000&nbsp;[[Horsepower#Indicated horsepower|ihp]], but could actually be driven significantly higher; in the case of ''Posen'', her engines could produce up to 28,100&nbsp;ihp. The engines were designed to provide a top speed of 19&nbsp;[[knots]], but in practice delivered up to 20&nbsp;knots. By comparison, ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s steam turbines provided a rated speed of 21&nbsp;knots.<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 21</ref> The ships carried 2,700&nbsp;tons of coal, and were later modified to carry an additional 160&nbsp;tons of oil that was to be sprayed on the coal, to increase its burn rate.<ref group=A>Due to the wartime situation, Germany had limited access to high quality coal, but was able to acquire lower-grade coal for its ships. The higher quality coal was generally reserved for the smaller craft, whose crews were less able to clean the boilers at the increased rate demanded by the low-quality coal. As a result, German capital ships were often supplied with poor coal, in the knowledge that their larger crews were better able to perform the increased maintenance. After 1915, the practice of spraying oil onto the low-quality coal was introduced, in order to increase the burn rate. See: Philbin, p. 56</ref> The power plant was divided into three engine rooms, which contained a total of 12 Marine-type boilers, each of which had 2 fireboxes, for a total of 24. The ships had eight turbo-generators, which produced 1,280&nbsp;kW at 225&nbsp;V.<ref name="Groner23"/>

===Armament===
Each ship carried twelve {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/45<ref group=A>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (Schiffskanone) denotes that the gun is emplaced on a ship, while the L/45 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/45 gun is 45 [[Caliber#Caliber as measurement of length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 45 as times long as it is in diameter.</ref> guns in an unusual hexagonal configuration;<ref group=A>The contemporary British dreadnoughts carried three of their five turrets on the centerline of the ship, while the other two were on the "wings". American and Japanese dreadnoughts carried all of their guns on the centerline.</ref> two twin [[Gun turret|turrets]] were mounted fore and aft (one on each end), and two were mounted on each flank of the ship.<ref name="Conways140"/> Firing directly forward and aft, the ships could bring 6 guns to bear, and 8 on the [[broadside]]; this was the same theoretical capability as ''Dreadnought'', but the ''Nassau'' class ships required two additional guns to achieve it.<ref name="Janes"/> The main guns on the flank were placed in Drh LC/1906 mounts, as were the centerline guns on the first two ships of the class, ''Nassau'' and ''Westfalen''. ''Posen'' and ''Rheinland'' carried their centerline guns in Drh LC/1907 mounts, which had a longer trunk that the LC/1906 design.<ref name="Conways140"/> The Drh LC/1906 mounts and 11-inch SK/L45 guns were designed specifically for the new German dreadnoughts in 1907. Both mountings allowed for elevation up to 20&nbsp;degrees, but the LC/1907 mounts could depress an additional two degrees, down to <U+2212>8.<ref name="Navweaps">{{cite web| last = DiGiulian| first = Tony| title = German 28 cm/45 (11") SK L/45| url = http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_11-45_skc07.htm| publisher = Navweaps.com| date = 19 April 2007| accessdate = 7 March 2009}}</ref> The main [[Artillery battery|battery]] [[propellant]] [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] were placed above shell rooms, with the exception of the centerline turrets of ''Nassau'' and ''Westfalen''.<ref name="Conways145"/> These guns fired 666&nbsp;lb shells, with a 57&nbsp;lb (26&nbsp;kg) fore propellant charge in silk bags and a 174&nbsp;lb (79&nbsp;kg) main charge in a brass case.<ref name="Navweaps"/> The guns fired the shells at a [[muzzle velocity]] of 2,805&nbsp;ft/s (855&nbsp;m/s), and had a maximum range of 22,400&nbsp;yards (20,500&nbsp;m).<ref name="Conways140">Gardiner and Gray, p. 140</ref> At a range of 13,100&nbsp;yards (12,000&nbsp;m), the 11&nbsp;in shells would penetrate up to 7.9&nbsp;in (200&nbsp;mm) of belt armor.<ref name="Navweaps"/>

The ships' secondary armament consisted of twelve {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/45 guns, which were mounted in [[casemate]]s. The guns fired 99.9&nbsp;lb shells at a muzzle velocity of 2,740&nbsp;ft/s (835&nbsp;m/s). The guns could be elevated to 19&nbsp;degrees, which provided a maximum range of 16,350&nbsp;yards (14950&nbsp;m). The ships also carried sixteen {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/45 guns, also in casemates. These guns fired a 22-lb projectile at 2,133&nbsp;ft/s (650&nbsp;m/s), and could be trained up to 25&nbsp;degrees for a maximum range of 10,500&nbsp;yards (9,600&nbsp;m).<ref name="Conways140"/> After 1915, two 8.8&nbsp;cm guns were removed and replaced by two 8.8&nbsp;cm Flak guns, and between 1916 and 1917, the remaining twelve 8.8&nbsp;cm casemated guns were removed.<ref name="Groner23"/> These anti-aircraft guns fired a slightly lighter 21.2&nbsp;lb shell at 2,510&nbsp;ft/s (765&nbsp;m/s). They could be elevated to 45&nbsp;degrees and could hit targets 12,900&nbsp;yards (11,800&nbsp;m) away. The ''Nassau''-class ships were also armed with six {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on}} submerged [[torpedo tube]]s. One tube was mounted in the bow, another in the stern, and two on each broadside, on either ends of the [[torpedo bulkhead]].<ref name="Conways140"/>

===Armor===
[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-37, Linienschiff "SMS Rheinland".jpg|thumb|right|''Rheinland''; note the torpedo nets along the side of the ship]]
The ''Nassau''-class ships were equipped with [[Krupp]] armor. The ships had an armored belt that was {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick at its strongest, where it protected the ship's vitals in the center, and as thin as {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} in less critical areas, such as the bow and stern. Behind the main belt was a [[torpedo bulkhead]] {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick<ref name="Groner23"/>; there was some difficulty mounting the torpedo bulkhead, due to the four wing turrets and their barbettes.<ref name="Janes"/> The ships' decks were armored, between 5.5<U+2013>8&nbsp;cm (2.1<U+2013>3.1&nbsp;in) thick. The forward [[conning tower]] had a roof that was {{convert|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and sides {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The aft conning tower was less well protected, with a {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick roof and {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} sides. The main battery turrets had roofs that were {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} sides. The casemated secondary battery had {{convert|16|cm|in|abbr=on}} worth of armor protection, and 8&nbsp;cm thick gun shields. The ships were also fitted with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed after 1916.<ref name="Groner23"/>

==Construction==
Four ships of the class were ordered, under the provisional names ''Ersatz Bayern'', ''Ersatz Sachsen'', ''Ersatz W<U+00FC>rttemburg'', and ''Ersatz Baden'', as replacements for the four old [[Sachsen class armored frigate|''Sachsen''-class armored frigates]].<ref group=A>The German navy orders a ship under a provisional name that indicates which obsolete unit of the fleet the new ship will replace. Upon completion, the ship is christened with the intended name. In this case, ''Ersatz Bayern'' was intended to replace {{SMS|Bayern|1878|6}}, and once the ship was finished, she was christened ''Nassau''.</ref> The first ship of the class, {{SMS|Nassau||2}}, was laid down on 22 July 1907 at the ''[[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|Kaiserliche Werft]]'' in [[Wilhelmshaven]], launched on 7 March 1908, and commissioned into the fleet on 1 October 1909. {{SMS|Westfalen||2}} was laid down less than a month later, on 12 August 1907 at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]]. The ship was launched on 1 July 1908, and commissioned on 16 November 1909.<ref name="Groner23-24">Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 23<U+2013>24</ref><ref name="Conways145"/>

{{SMS|Rheinland||2}}, the third ship of the class, was actually the first to be laid down, on 1 June 1907 in the [[AG Vulcan Stettin|AG Vulcan]] shipyard in [[Stettin]]. Construction of ''Rheinland'' proceeded slower than ''Nassau'' and ''Westfalen'', and so the ship was launched later, on 26 September 1908. ''Rheinland'' joined the fleet on 30 April 1910. {{SMS|Posen||2}}, the last ship of the class, was laid down at the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]] on 11 June 1907. The ship was not launched until 12 December 1908, and did not join her sisters until 31 May 1910.<ref name="Conways145"/><ref name="Groner24">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 24</ref>

==Service history==
[[File:SMS Westfalen LOC 25466u.jpg|thumb|right|''Westfalen'' underway prior to 1917]]
The ''Nassau''-class ships operated as a unit in the [[High Seas Fleet]]: the II&nbsp;Division of the I&nbsp;Battle Squadron. The ships of the class participated in a number of fleet operations in the [[North Sea]], including the action on 31 May 1916 that resulted in the [[Battle of Jutland]]. The ships also saw limited service in the [[Baltic Sea]], including the abortive [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915.

===Battle of the Gulf of Riga===
{{Main|Battle of the Gulf of Riga}}
In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the [[Gulf of Riga]], in order to facilitate the capture of [[Riga]] by the German army. To do so, the German planners intended to drive off or destroy the Russian naval forces in the gulf, which included the pre-dreadnought ''[[Russian battleship Slava|Slava]]'' and a number of gunboats and destroyers, and lay a series of minefields in the northern entrance to the gulf. The fleet that assembled to assault the gulf included the four ''Nassau''-class ships, the four {{sclass|Helgoland|battleship|2}}s, and the battlecruisers {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}}, and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}. The eight battleships were to provide cover for the forces engaging the Russian flotilla. The first attempt on 8 August was unsuccessful, as it had taken too long to clear the Russian minefields to allow the minelayer {{SMS|Deutschland|1914|2}} to lay a minefield of her own.<ref>Halpern, pp. 195<U+2013>197</ref>

On 16 August, a second attempt was made to enter the gulf: ''Nassau'' and ''Posen'', four light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats breached the defenses to the gulf.<ref>Halpern, p. 197</ref> On the first day of the assault, the German minesweeper ''T 46'' was sunk, as was the destroyer ''V 99''. On 17 August, ''Nassau'' and ''Posen'' engaged in an artillery duel with ''Slava'', resulting in three hits on the Russian ship that prompted her withdrawal. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the gulf the following day.<ref>Halpern, pp. 197<U+2013>198</ref>

===Battle of Jutland===
{{main|Battle of Jutland}}
The ships took part in the inconclusive Battle of Jutland on 31 May <U+2013> 1 June 1916. For the majority of the battle, the I&nbsp;Battle Squadron formed the center of the [[line of battle]], behind Rear Admiral Behncke's III&nbsp;Battle Squadron, and followed by Rear Admiral Mauve's elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the II&nbsp;Battle Squadron. ''Posen'' served as the division flagship, under the command of Rear Admiral W. Engelhardt.<ref>Tarrant, p. 286</ref>

At around midnight on 1 June, ''Nassau'' came in contact with the British destroyer {{HMS|Spitfire|1912|2}}, and in the confusion, attempted to ram her. ''Spitfire'' tried to evade, but could not maneuver away fast enough, and the two ships collided. ''Nassau'' fired her forward 11-inch guns at the destroyer, but they could not depress low enough for ''Nassau'' to be able to score a hit. Nonetheless, the blast from the guns destroyed ''Spitfire''{{'}}s bridge. At that point, ''Spitfire'' was able to disengage from ''Nassau'', and took with her a 20-foot (6&nbsp;m) portion of ''Nassau''{{'}}s side plating. The collision disabled one of her 5.9-inch guns, and left an 11.5-foot (3.5&nbsp;m) gash above the waterline; this slowed the ship to 15&nbsp;knots until it could be repaired.<ref>Tarrant, p. 220</ref> At approximately the same time, ''Posen'' accidentally rammed the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Elbing||2}} and holed her below the waterline. ''Elbing'' was damaged so severely that her engine room was completely flooded and she was unable to move; the captain of the ship ordered ''Elbing'' be scuttled to prevent her capture by the British.<ref>Tarrant, p. 250</ref>

Shortly after 01:00, ''Nassau'' and {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} encountered the British armored cruiser {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|2}}. ''Th<U+00FC>ringen'' opened fire first, and pummeled ''Black Prince'' with a total of 27 heavy-caliber shells and 24 shells from her secondary battery. ''Nassau'' and {{SMS|Ostfriesland||2}} joined in, followed by {{SMS|Friedrich der Grosse|1911|2}}.<ref name="Tarrant225">Tarrant, p. 225</ref>
{{Quote|[''Black Prince''] presented a terrible and awe-inspiring spectacle as she drifted down the line blazing furiously until, after several minor detonations, she disappeared below the surface with the whole of her crew in one tremendous explosion.<ref name="Tarrant225"/>}}
The wreck of the ship was directly in the path of ''Nassau''; to avoid it, the ship had to steer sharply towards the III&nbsp;Battle Squadron. It was necessary for the ship to steam at full speed astern in order to avoid a collision with {{SMS|Kaiserin||2}}. ''Nassau'' then fell back into a position between the pre-dreadnoughts {{SMS|Hessen||2}} and {{SMS|Hannover||2}}.<ref name="Tarrant225"/>

Following the return to German waters, ''Nassau'', ''Posen'', and ''Westfalen'', along with the ''Helgoland''-class battleships {{SMS|Helgoland||2}} and ''Th<U+00FC>ringen'', took up defensive positions in the [[Jadebusen|Jade]] [[roadstead]] for the night.<ref>Tarrant, p. 263</ref> The ''Nassau''-class ships suffered only a handful of [[Battleship secondary armament|secondary battery]] hits from the opposing [[Grand Fleet]]; ''Nassau'' was hit twice, ''Westfalen'' and ''Rheinland'' each once, and ''Posen'' escaped completely unscathed. Not a single ship of the four was struck by a heavy-caliber shell.<ref>Tarrant, p. 296</ref>

===Later operations===
[[File:High Seas Fleet 1st and 2nd battleship squadrons HD-SN-99-02145.JPG|thumb|I and II Battle Squadrons in Kiel harbor]]
Less than three months after Jutland, ''Westfalen'' was torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|E23||2}} on 19 August 1916, but suffered minimal damage and was soon repaired.<ref name="Hore67">Hore, p. 67</ref> In 1918, ''Westfalen'' and ''Rheinland'' were detached from the High Seas Fleet and ordered into the [[Baltic Sea]]. Finland was [[Finnish Civil War|revolting against Russian rule]], and the two ships were to aid the Finns in the civil war.<ref name="Hore67"/> On 11 April at approximately 07:30, ''Rheinland'' ran aground off the [[<U+00C5>land Islands]]; the ship was disarmed, armor was cut away, and much of the ship's coal was removed in order to lighten her enough to be refloated, which was not accomplished until 9 July.<ref name="Groner24"/> ''Rheinland'' was never repaired, and instead saw the remainder of her service as a barracks ship in Kiel.<ref name="Hore67"/>

Following the end of the First World War in 1918, eleven battleships of the {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|5}}, {{sclass|Kaiser|battleship|5}}, and {{sclass|Bayern|battleship|5}} classes and all five battlecruisers, along with a number of light cruisers and destroyers, were interned in [[Scapa Flow]], while their fate was determined in the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]].<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 139</ref> The ''Nassau''- and ''[[Helgoland class battleship|Helgoland]]''-class battleships were left in Germany. Following the [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow|scuttling of the German fleet]] in June 1919, all four ships were allotted to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the scuttled ships.<ref name="Hore67"/> ''Nassau'' was given to Japan, Britain received ''Westfalen'' and ''Posen'', and ''Rheinland'' was sold directly to the breakers in [[Dordrecht]]. Ultimately, all four ships were scrapped in Dordrecht between 1920 and 1924.<ref name="Groner23-24"/>
