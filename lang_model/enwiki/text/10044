The '''least weasel''' (''Mustela nivalis''), or simply '''[[weasel]]''' in the UK,<ref name=SOED>{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-19-920687-2|page=3804}}</ref> is the smallest member of the [[genus]] ''[[Mustela]]'' and of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mustelidae]] (as well as the smallest of the [[Carnivora]]), native to [[Eurasia]], [[North America]] and [[North Africa]], though it has been introduced elsewhere. It is classed as being of [[Least Concern]] by the [[IUCN]], due to its wide distribution and presumed large population.

Least weasels from various parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and elongated and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating the boundary between the two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and in the northern part of its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.

Small rodents form the largest part of the least weasel's diet, but it also kills and eats rabbits and other mammals, and occasionally birds, birds' eggs, fish and frogs. Males mark their territories with [[Territory (animal)#Scent marking|olfactory signals]] and have exclusive home ranges which may include several female ranges. Least weasels use pre-existing holes to sleep, store food and raise their young. Breeding takes place in the spring and summer, and there is a single litter of about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female. Due to its small size, fierce nature and cunning behaviour, the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The least weasel was given its scientific name ''Mustela nivalis'' by Carl Linnaeus in his [[12th edition of Systema Naturae]] in 1766. The [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]] was [[Westrobothnia]] in Sweden. As an animal with a very wide distribution, the morphology of the least weasel varies geographically. The species was reviewed by Reichstein in 1957 and again by van Zyll de Jong in 1992 and Reig in 1997. Youngman (1982) placed it in the subgenus ''Mustela'' while Abramov (1999) considered it should be included in the subgenus ''Gale''. Based on skull characteristics, Reig (1997) proposed that the [[taxon]] should be split into four species, ''M. subpalmata'', ''M. rixosa'', ''M. vulgaris'' and ''M. eskimo''. Abrimov and Baryshinikov (2000) disagreed, recognising only ''M. subpalmata'' as a separate species.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mammal Species of the World: A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference, Volume 12 |last=Wilson |first=Don E. |last2=Reeder |first2=DeeAnn M. (eds.) |year=2005 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8221-0 |pages=616<U+2013>617 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JgAMbNSt8ikC&pg=PA1601 }}</ref>

Within the genus ''Mustela'', the least weasel is a relatively unspecialised form, as evidenced by its [[pedomorphism|pedomorphic]] skull, which occurs even in large subspecies.<ref name="s972">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=972}}</ref> Its direct ancestor was ''Mustela praenivalis'', which lived in Europe during the [[Middle Pleistocene]] and [[Villafranchian]]. ''M. praenivalis'' itself was probably preceded by ''M. pliocaenica'' of the [[Pliocene]]. The modern species probably arose during the [[Late Pleistocene]].<ref name="k102">{{Harvnb|Kurt<U+00E9>n|1968|pp=102<U+2013>103}}</ref> The least weasel is the product of a process begun 5<U+2013>7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The weasel's ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source. The least weasel throve during the [[Ice Age]], as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. It probably crossed to North America through the [[Bering land bridge]] 200,000 years ago.<ref name="mac205">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1992|p=205}}</ref>

===Subspecies===
[[File:MSU V2P1b - Mustela nivalis subspecies painting.png|thumb|Various least weasel subspecies; (from left to right) ''M. n. pygmaea'', ''M. n. nivalis'', ''M. n. pallida'', ''M. n. vulgaris'', ''M. n. boccamela'', ''M. n. heptneri'']]
The least weasel has a high geographic variation, a fact which has historically led to numerous disagreements among biologists studying its systematics. Least weasel subspecies are divided into 3 categories:<ref name="s975">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=975<U+2013>978}}</ref>

* The '''pygmaea<U+2013>rixosa''' group (small weasels): Tiny weasels with short tails, [[Neoteny|pedomorphic]] skulls, and pelts that turn pure white in winter. They inhabit northern [[European Russia]], [[Siberia]], the [[Russian Far East]], [[Finland]], northern [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], [[Mongolia]], northeastern [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[North America]].<ref name="s975"/>
* The '''boccamela''' group (large weasels): Very large weasels with large skulls, relatively long tails and lighter coloured pelts. Locally, they either do not turn white or only partially change colour in winter. They inhabit [[Transcaucasia]], from western [[Kazakhstan]] to [[Semirechye]] and in the flat deserts of [[Middle Asia]]. They are also found in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.<ref name="s975"/>
* The '''nivalis''' group (average weasels): Medium-sized weasels, with tails of moderate length, representing a transitional form between the former two groups. They inhabit the middle and southern regions of European Russia, [[Crimea]], [[Ciscaucasus]], western Kazakhstan, southern and middle [[Urals]] and montane parts of Middle Asia, save for [[Koppet Dag]].<ref name="s975"/>

{{As of|2005|uc=on}},<ref>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id =14001438}}</ref> 18 subspecies are recognised.

==Physical description==
[[File:Frenataermineanivalis.png|thumb|Skulls of a [[long-tailed weasel]] (top), a [[stoat]] (bottom left) and least weasel (bottom right), as illustrated in [[Clinton Hart Merriam|Merriam]]'s ''Synopsis of the Weasels of North America'']]
The least weasel has a thin, greatly elongated and extremely flexible body with a small, yet elongated, blunt-muzzled head which is no thicker than the neck. The eyes are large, bulging and dark coloured. The legs and tail are relatively short, the latter constituting less than half the body length. The feet are armed with sharp, dark-coloured claws, and the [[sole (foot)|sole]]s are heavily haired.<ref name="s967">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=967<U+2013>969}}</ref> The skull, especially that of the small ''rixosa'' group, has an infantile appearance when compared with that of other members of the genus ''Mustela'' (in particular, the stoat and [[Siberian weasel|kolonok]]). This is expressed in the relatively large size of the [[cranium]] and shortened facial region.<ref name="s969">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=969}}</ref> The skull is, overall, similar to that of the stoat, but smaller, though the skulls of large male weasels tend to overlap in size with those of small female stoats.<ref name="h468"/> There are usually four pairs of nipples but these are only visible in females. The [[baculum]] is short, {{convert|16|to|20|mm|1|abbr=on}}, with a thick, straight shaft. [[Fat]] is deposited along the spine, kidneys, gut mesentries and around the limbs. The least weasel has muscular anal glands under the tail, which measure {{convert|7|by|5|mm|1|abbr=on}}, and contain sulphurous volatiles, including [[thietane]]s and dithiacyclopentanes. The smell and chemical composition of these chemicals are distinct from those of the stoat.<ref name="h468">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=468}}</ref> The least weasel moves by jumping, the distance between the tracks of the fore and hind limbs being {{convert|18|to|35|cm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="s991">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=991}}</ref>

[[File:Weaselskeleton.jpg|left|thumb|Skeleton, as illustrated in [[Richard Lydekker|Lydekker]]'s ''The New Natural History'']]
Dimensions vary geographically, to an extent rarely found among other mammals. Least weasels of the ''vulgaris'' group, for example, may outweigh the smaller races by almost four times. In some large subspecies, the male may be 1.5 times longer than the female. Variations in tail length are also variable, constituting from 13<U+2013>30% of the length of the body. Average body length in males is {{convert|130|to|260|mm|0|abbr=on}}, while females average {{convert|114|to|204|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The tail measures {{convert|12|to|87|mm|1|abbr=on}} in males and {{convert|17|to|60|mm|1|abbr=onconvert|}} in females. Males weigh {{convert|36|to|250|g|1|abbr=on}}, while females weigh {{convert|29|to|117|g|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="s970">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=970<U+2013>972}}</ref>

[[File:Mustela winter.jpg|thumb|right|The winter coat is conspicuous when there is no snow on the ground.]]
The winter fur is dense, but short and closely fitting. In northern subspecies, the fur is soft and silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot at the corner of the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is  never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.<ref name="s969"/><ref name=Collins>{{cite book |title=Mammals |last=Konig |first=Claus |year=1973 |publisher=Collins & Co. |isbn=978-0-00-212080-7 |page=167 }}</ref>

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Reproduction and development===
The least weasel mates in April<U+2013>July and there is a 34- to 37-day [[gestation period]]. In the [[northern hemisphere]], the average litter size consists of 6 kits and these reach [[sexual maturity]] in 3 to 4 months. Males may mate during their first year of life, though this is usually unsuccessful. They are [[fecund]] in February<U+2013>October, though the early stages of [[spermatogenesis]] do occur throughout the winter months. [[Estrous cycle#Anestrus|Anestrus]] in females lasts from September until February.<ref name="h474">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=474}}</ref>

The female raises its kits without help from the male. They are {{convert|1.5|to|4.5|g|2|abbr=on}} in weight at birth. Newborn kits are born pink, naked, blind and deaf, but gain a white coat of downy fur at the age of 4 days. At 10 days, the margin between the dark upper parts and light under parts becomes visible. The [[milk teeth]] erupt at 2 to 3 weeks of age, at which point the young start to eat solid food, though lactation can last 12 weeks. The eyes and ears open at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and by 8 weeks, killing behaviour is developed. The family breaks up after 9 to 12 weeks.<ref name="h474"/> There is a single litter each year and least weasels can live for 7 or 8 years.<ref name=Collins/>

===Territorial and social behaviours===
[[File:Mustela_nivalis_%28two,_fighting%29.jpg|thumb|left|Two least weasels fighting]]
The least weasel has a typical mustelid territorial pattern, consisting of exclusive male ranges encompassing multiple female ranges. The population density of each territory depends greatly on food supply and reproductive success, thus the social structure and population density of any given territory is unstable and flexible.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Erlinge, S. |year=1974 |title=Distribution, Territoriality and Numbers of the Weasel ''Mustela nivalis'' in Relation to Prey Abundance |journal=Oikus |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=308<U+2013>314 |jstor=3543948 }}</ref>  Like the stoat, the male least weasel extends its range during spring or during food shortages. Its [[scent marking]] behaviour is similar to that of the stoat; it uses [[faeces]], [[urine]] and anal and dermal gland secretions, the latter two of which are deposited by anal dragging and body rubbing. The least weasel does not dig its own den, but nests in the abandoned burrow of another species such as a mole or rat.<ref name="h471">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=471<U+2013>472}}</ref> The burrow entrance measures about 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in) across and leads to the nest chamber located up to 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) below ground. The nest chamber (which is used for sleeping, rearing kits and storing food) measures 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) in diameter, and is lined with straw and the skins of the weasel's prey.<ref name="m277">{{Harvnb|Merritt|Matinko|1987|p=277}}</ref>

The least weasel has four basic vocalisations; a guttural hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters between males and females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing aggression is similar to that of the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.<ref name="h471"/>

===Diet===
[[File:Donnola vs lepre.JPG|thumb|right|Taxidermy exhibit showing a least weasel attacking a [[European hare]], in the Natural History Museum of Genoa]]
The least weasel feeds predominantly on [[mouse]]-like [[rodent]]s, including mice, [[hamster]]s, [[gerbil]]s and others. It usually does not attack adult hamsters and [[rat]]s. [[Frog]]s, [[fish]], small [[bird]]s and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It can deal with adult [[pika]]s and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome [[brown rat]]s and [[souslik]]s. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as [[capercaillie]], [[Hazel Grouse|hazel hen]] and [[hare]]s.<ref name="s987">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|pp=987<U+2013>988}}</ref> In England, a favoured prey item is the [[field vole]] (''Microtus agrestis''). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel's diet. In years of scarcity, birds form a greater proportion of the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tapper, Stephen |year=1979 |title=The Effect of Fluctuating Vole Numbers (''Microtus agrestis'') on a Population of Weasels (''Mustela nivalis'') on Farmland |journal=Animal Ecology |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=603<U+2013>617 |jstor=4182 }}</ref>

Despite its small size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable of killing a [[rabbit]] five to ten times its own weight.<ref name="mac208">{{Harvnb|Macdonald|1992|p=208}}</ref> Although they are commonly taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take a higher proportion of rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.<ref name="h472">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|pp=472<U+2013>473}}</ref>

The least weasel forages undercover, to avoid being seen by foxes and birds of prey. It is adapted for pursuing its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open.<ref name="h472"/> The least weasel kills small prey, such as [[vole]]s, with a bite to the [[occiput|occipital]] region of the skull<ref name="s987"/> or the neck, dislocating the [[cervical vertebrae]]. Large prey typically dies of [[blood loss]] or [[Shock (circulatory)|circulatory shock]].<ref name="h472"/> When food is abundant, only a small portion of the prey is eaten, usually the [[brain]]. The average daily food intake is {{convert|35|g|0|abbr=on}}, which is equivalent to 30<U+2013>35% of the animal's body weight.<ref name="s987"/>

===Predators and competitors===
[[File:Weaselsvsstoat.png|thumb|Least weasels driven from a [[mountain hare]] carcass by a [[stoat]], as illustrated in [[Gerald Edwin Hamilton Barrett-Hamilton|Barrett-Hamilton]]'s ''A History of British Mammals'']]
The least weasel is small enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators.<ref name="h475">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=475}}</ref> Least weasel remains have been found in the excrement of [[red fox]]es, [[sable]]s, [[steppe polecat|steppe]] and [[European Polecat|forest polecat]], [[stoat]]s, [[eagle owl]]s and [[buzzard]]s.<ref name="s992">{{Harvnb|Heptner|Sludskii|2002|p=992}}</ref> The [[owls]] most efficient at capturing least weasels are [[barn owl|barn]], [[barred owl|barred]], and [[great horned owl]]s. Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include [[Broad-winged Hawk|broad-winged]] and [[rough-legged buzzard]]s. Some [[snake]] species may prey on the least weasel, including the [[black rat snake]] and [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]].<ref name="m277"/> Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.<ref name="h475"/>

In areas where the least weasel is [[Sympatry|sympatric]] with the stoat, the two species compete with each other for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.<ref name="h469">{{Harvnb|Harris|Yalden|2008|p=469}}</ref>

=== Diseases and parasites ===
[[Ectoparasite]]s known to infest weasels include the [[louse]] ''Trichodectes mustelae'' and the [[mite]]s ''[[Demodex]]'' and ''Psoregates mustela''. The species may catch [[flea]]s from the nests and burrows of its prey. Flea species known to infest weasels include ''Ctenophthalmus bisoctodentatus'' and ''Palaeopsylla m. minor'', which they get from moles, ''P. s. soricis'', which they get from shrews, ''Nosopsyllus fasciatus'', which they get from rodents and ''Dasypsyllus gallinulae'' which they get from birds.<ref name="h475"/>

[[Helminth]]s known to infest weasels include the [[trematode]] ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', the [[nematode]]s ''[[Capillaria (genus)|Capillaria]]'', ''Filaroides'' and ''[[Trichinella]]'' and the [[cestode]] ''[[Taenia (genus)|Taenia]]''.<ref name="h475"/> Least weasels are commonly infected with the [[nematode]] ''[[Skrjabingylus nasicola]]'', adults of which are found in the nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested  animals.<ref>{{cite journal |author=King, Carolyn M. |year=1977 |title=The effects of the nematode parasite ''Skrjabingylus nasicola'' on British weasels (''Mustela nivalis'') |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=182 |issue=2 |pages=225<U+2013>249 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04157.x }}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Alaska_Weasel.jpg|thumb|right|Alaskan weasel ''Mustela n. eskimo'']]
The least weasel has a [[circumboreal]], [[Holarctic]] distribution, encompassing much of [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], [[Asia]] and parts of northern [[North America]], where it occurs mainly in places where the stoat isn't found, though it has been introduced in [[New Zealand]], [[Malta]], [[Crete]], the [[Azore Islands]] and also [[Sao Tome]] off west Africa. It is found throughout Europe and on many islands, including the Azores, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] (but not [[Ireland]]), and all major [[Mediterranean]] islands. It also occurs on [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]] islands in [[Japan]] and on [[Kunashir]], [[Iturup]], and [[Sakhalin]] Islands in [[Russia]].<ref name="iucn"/>

The least weasel occupies a similar type of habitat as the stoat but it less often frequents wet places. It can be found in fields, open woodland, bushy or rocky areas, parks and gardens, and at altitudes of up to about {{convert|3000|m}}.<ref name=Collins/>

==Conservation status==
The least weasel has a very wide circumboreal range and a large total population and is therefore listed by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as being of "[[least concern]]". Its chosen habitat is in areas of coarse vegetation and in some regions its numbers may be decreasing because of changes in agricultural practices, but altogether its population trend is thought to be steady. It is relatively common in Eurasia but less abundant in North America and is thought to be rare in the southeastern United States. It is subject to considerable variations in numbers in areas where its main rodent prey is liable to large population fluctuations. In years of rodent population booms, the least weasel numbers may rise by up to ten-fold, only to slump again as prey becomes scarce again in the following years.<ref name="iucn"/>

== In folklore and mythology ==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - The basilisk and the weasel.jpg|thumb|17th century print of a weasel confronting a [[basilisk]]]]
The [[Ancient Macedonians]] believed that to see a least weasel was a good omen. In some districts of [[Macedon]], women who suffered from headaches after having washed their heads in water drawn overnight would assume that a weasel had previously used the water as a mirror, but they would refrain from mentioning the animal's name for fear that it would destroy their clothes. Similarly, a popular superstition in southern [[Greece]] had it that the least weasel had previously been a [[bride]], who was transformed into a bitter animal which would destroy the wedding dresses of other brides out of jealousy.<ref>Abbott, G. A. (1903), ''Macedonian Folklore'', pp. 108<U+2013>109, Cambridge University Press</ref> According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the least weasel is the only animal capable of killing the [[basilisk]];

<blockquote>To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Natural History|author=Pliny the Elder, eds. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]] (translators)|year=1855|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137;query=chapter%3D%23358;layout=;loc=8.32 |accessdate=2009-06-10}}</ref></blockquote>

The [[Chippewa]] believed that the least weasel could kill the dreaded [[wendigo]] giant by rushing up its anus.<ref>Barnouw, Victor (1979) ''Wisconsin Chippewa Myths & Tales: And Their Relation to Chippewa Life'', pp. 53, University of Wisconsin Press, ISBN 0-299-07314-9</ref> In [[Inuit mythology]], the least weasel is credited with both great wisdom and courage, and whenever a mythical [[Inuit]] hero wished to accomplish a valorous task, he would generally change himself into a least weasel.<ref>Dufresne, Frank (2005), ''Alaska's Animals and Fishes'', pp. 109, Kessinger Publishing, ISBN 1-4179-8416-3</ref> According to [[Matthew Hopkins]], a witch hunter general during the [[English Civil War]], least weasels were the [[Familiar spirit|familiar]]s of [[witch]]es.<ref>Summers, Montague (2005) ''Geography of Witchcraft'', pp. 29, Kessinger Publishing, ISBN 0-7661-4536-0</ref>
