The [[memorial]] is adjacent to the [[Archives<U+2013>Navy Memorial<U+2013>Penn Quarter (Washington Metro)|Archives<U+2013>Navy Memorial<U+2013>Penn Quarter]] station and the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] building.

==History==
For America<U+2019>s sea services, The United States Navy Memorial is the triumph of a centuries-old dream.  In the early days of America<U+2019>s national independence, architect [[Pierre L'Enfant]] envisioned a memorial in the Nation<U+2019>s Capital "to celebrate the first rise of the Navy and consecrate its progress and achievements."{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  But it was only in the twentieth century that L<U+2019>Enfant<U+2019>s vision of a Navy Memorial in Washington, D.C. was realized.

Pennsylvania Avenue, <U+201C>America<U+2019>s Main Street,<U+201D> the boulevard that links the U.S. Capitol and White House, the scene of so many parades, pageants, and national memories, was chosen to be the location.

After President John F. Kennedy <U+2013> himself a Navy war hero <U+2013> inspired the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue, another Navy war hero, Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]], proclaimed in 1977 that <U+201C>we have talked long enough about a Navy Memorial and it's time we did something about it."{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

In the Spring of 1977, Burke <U+2014> World War II war hero and former three-term [[Chief of Naval Operations]] <U+2014> started to recruit a group to form the private, non-profit U. S. Navy Memorial Foundation. The following year, the Foundation, led by Rear Admiral William Thompson, USN (Ret.), started to work on the five steps necessary in the building of a memorial in Washington: enabling legislation, design, site selection, fund raising, and construction and maintenance.

Congress authorized the Memorial in 1980, with the stipulation that funding come solely from private contributions. In March 1980, President [[Jimmy Carter]] signed Public Law 96-199, which authorized the Memorial as a part of a larger Department of the Interior bill.

Although a number of sites in Washington, DC, were possible, the Foundation teamed up with the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation to use Market Square as the site for the Memorial. The Foundation and the Corporation jointly selected Conklin [[James Rossant|Rossant]] of New York as architects.

[[File:Fountains - United States Navy Memorial.JPG|thumb|left|Navy Memorial]]
By December 1985, the Foundation had raised enough funds to warrant a go-ahead approval from the Secretary of the Interior, and construction got underway the following month. (The Foundation staff and Board of Directors had raised $18-million by opening day of the Visitors Center, and fund raising continues today, to retire remaining construction debt and support educational programs undertaken by the Foundation.)

By August 1987, Stanley Bleifeld completed work on the ''[[The Lone Sailor]]'' statue as construction of the Memorial neared completion at the site.

The Memorial was dedicated on October 13, 1987.

From late 1987 to mid-1990, two  buildings were constructed on the Memorial's northern perimeter. The eastern of the two buildings was selected for the Memorial's Visitors Center. The building's shell was sufficiently completed by September 1989 to allow construction to begin for the interior of the Visitors Center. The Visitors Center opened in June 1991 and was formally dedicated on October 12, 1991.

During the summer of 2006, the water in the fountains of the Navy Memorial was colored blue due to the presence of chemicals added to the water to fight algae growth.<ref name="Algae 1">{{cite web

The United States Navy Memorial is home to the Memorial Plaza, which features Stanly Bleifield's famous statue, ''The Lone Sailor''. ''The Lone Sailor'' <U+2014> a tribute to all personnel of the sea services <U+2014> overlooks the Granite Sea, an exact replication of the world's oceans. Surrounding the Granite Sea are two fountain pools, honoring the personnel of the American Navy and the other navies of the world. The southern hemisphere of the Granite Sea is surrounded by 26 bronze [[bas-relief]]s commemorating events, personnel, and communities of the various sea services.

Adjacent to the Memorial Plaza is the Naval Heritage Center, which features the Arleigh Burke Theater, several rotating exhibits about the sea services, and several Navy Log kiosks, for easy registration on the Navy Log. The Naval Heritage Center also features daily screenings of the films ''At Sea'' and ''A Day in the Life of the Blue Angels''. The Media Resource Center provides a library of printed, audio and video historical documents on the Navy. The Navy Log room has touch-screen kiosks to register and search for Sea Service members and [[veteran]]s.
