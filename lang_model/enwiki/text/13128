=== Biography ===
Jonathan Garb  was born in 1967 in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], and immigrated to [[Israel]] in 1973. In the 1980<U+2019>s, Garb studied [[Talmud]] and Kabbalah in the [[Yeshiva|Lithuanian Yeshiva world]], where he also studied [[Mussar]] with R. [[Shlomo Wolbe]] and R. [http://ravleuchter.com/ Reuven Leuchter]. He earned his [[B.A.]], [[M.A.]], and [[Ph.D]]. degrees at the Hebrew University between the years 1990 to 2001, his M.A. and Ph.D. dissertations were advised by Prof. [http://www.nyutikvah.org/fellows/moshe_idel.html Moshe Idel]. He was a post-doctoral fellow at [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]]. He served as a guest lecturer at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences|L<U+2019><U+00C9>cole des hautes <U+00E9>tudes en sciences sociales]] in [[Paris]]. In 2010, Garb received the Israeli President<U+2019>s Prize for Outstanding Researcher (Ben Porat/Pollack Family Foundation). During the academic year 2011-2012, he is a fellow at the [http://www.nyutikvah.org/ Tikvah Center for Law and Jewish Civilization] at [[New York University]].<ref>http://www.nyutikvah.org/fellows/fellows_11_12/jonathan_garb.html</ref>  
=== Scholarship ===
Garb<U+2019>s research interests cover rabbinic thought, modern and contemporary Kabbalah, and the comparative study of mystical techniques and experiences, particularly [[Shamanism]] and [[Trance]]. From a geographical point of view, Garb<U+2019>s scholarship has focused on [[Jerusalem]], [[North Africa]], and [[Prague]]. Recently, he focuses on [[Italy]], particularity on the circle of R. [[Moshe Hayyim Luzzatto]]. He claims that other members of the circle may have written many texts attributed to Luzzatto.<ref>Jonathan Garb, <U+201C>The Authentic Kabbalistic Writings of R. Moses Hayyim Luzzatto.<U+201D> ''Kabbalah: Journal for the Study of Jewish Mystical Texts'' 25 (2011).</ref>
His research strongly draws from [[Post-modernism|post-modern theory]], especially the work of [[Michel Foucault]] and its antecedents.<ref>http://www.huji.ac.il/dataj/controller/ihoker/MOP-STAFF_LINK?sno=9728061&Save_t=</ref>   
Following the phenomenological approach of his main teacher, Jonathan Garb is considered one of the leading student<U+2019>s of Moshe Idel.<ref>See Boaz Huss, "The New Age of Kabbalah Research: Book Review of Ron Margolin, The Human Temple; Melila Hellner-Eshed, A River Issues Forth from Eden; Jonathan Garb, Manifestations of Power in Jewish Mysticism,<U+201D> ''Theory and Criticism'' 27 (2005), pp. 246-253 and Zvi Leshem<U+2019>s Review <U+201C>Demystifying Kabbalah,<U+201D> ''Jerusalem Post'', 11/26/2009 (http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Article.aspx?id=161505 ).</ref>  As such, he has been critiqued <U+2014> among others by [[Peter Sch<U+00E4>fer]] <U+2014> as using <U+201C>academic scholarship and its results as building blocks for a new, postmodern mystical Jewish religion.<U+201D><ref>Peter Sch<U+00E4>fer, ''The Origins of Jewish Mysticism''. Princeton and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2009, 26 and n 93. For Sch<U+00E4>fer<U+2019>s discussion on Idel<U+2019>s phenomenological approach, see also idem., 25-26. </ref>  
Garb<U+2019>s monographic studies significantly exceed the dominant philological-historical approach in the study of Jewish mystical texts applied by [[Gershom Scholem]] and his followers.
In his ''Manifestations of Power in Jewish Mysticism'', Garb offers a Foucauldian reading of rabbinic thought and earlier Kabbalah. ''The Chosen Will Become Herds'' <U+201C>examines twentieth-century Kabbalah in its Israeli and global context, drawing from an impressive range of [[Hasidic]], [[Lithuanian]], Oriental-[[Sephardic]], and [[Religious Zionist]] sources.<U+201D><ref>http://www.amazon.com/Chosen-Will-Become-Herds-Twentieth-Century/product-reviews/0300123949/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1</ref>  It is considered as one of the most comprehensive studies of modern and contemporary Kabbalah to date.<ref>See Shaul Magid, <U+201C>Mysticism, History, and a "New" Kabbalah: Gershom Scholem and the Contemporary Scene.<U+201D> ''Jewish Quartely Review'' 101/4 (2011): 513.</ref>  Garb<U+2019>s third monograph, ''Shamanic Trance in Modern Kabbalah'', offers an [[Ericksonian Hypnosis|Ericksonian]] reading of sixteenth century Kabbalistic writings and Hasidic literature.
In dozens of articles, he has discussed issues such as [[gender]], [[language]], [[antinomianism]], [[poetics]], [[magic]], and [[sainthood]].<ref>For an overview of Garb<U+2019>s articles, see http://huji.academia.edu/JonathanGarb.</ref>  Besides his academic writing, Garb has published essays in [[Hebrew]] on social critique,<ref>http://www.acheret.co.il/?cmd=articles.144&act=read&id=586</ref>  the [[New Age]],<ref>http://www.zeek.net/604garb/</ref>  and the contemporary [[Haredi]] world.<ref>http://www.acheret.co.il/?cmd=articles.124&act=read&id=366</ref>
