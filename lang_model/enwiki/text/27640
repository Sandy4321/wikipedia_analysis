'''Gamma-ray bursts''' ('''GRBs''') are flashes of [[gamma ray]]s associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. They are the [[Luminosity|brightest]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] events known to occur in the [[universe]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gamma Rays|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays.html|work=NASA}}</ref>  Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes. The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived "afterglow" emitted at longer wavelengths ([[X-ray]], [[ultraviolet]], [[visible spectrum|optical]], [[infrared]], [[microwave]] and [[radio waves|radio]]).<ref>[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne & Atteia 2009]]</ref>

Most observed GRBs are believed to consist of a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a [[supernova]] or [[hypernova]] as a rapidly rotating, high-mass star collapses to form a [[neutron star]], [[quark star]], or [[black hole]]. A subclass of GRBs (the "short" bursts) appear to originate from a different process. This may be the merger of [[binary star|binary]] [[neutron stars]]. The cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be due to the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision, causing the entire crust of the star to shatter.<ref>{{cite article |title=Resonant Shattering of Neutron Star Crust |author=Tsang, David and Read, Jocelyn S. and Hinderer, Tanja and Piro, Anthony L. and Bondarescu, Ruxandra |year=2012 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=108 |pages=5 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.011102}}</ref>

The sources of most GRBs are billions of [[light year]]s away from [[Earth]], implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the [[Sun]] will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years<ref name="rates">[[#Podsiadlowski|Podsiadlowski 2004]]</ref>).  All observed GRBs have originated from outside the [[Milky Way galaxy]], although a related class of phenomena, [[soft gamma repeater]] flares, are associated with [[magnetar]]s within the Milky Way. It has been hypothesized that a gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way, pointing directly towards the Earth, could cause a [[mass extinction]] event.<ref name="Melott2004">[[#Melott|Melott 2004]]</ref>

GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela satellites]], a series of satellites designed to detect [[Partial Test Ban Treaty|covert nuclear weapons tests]].  Hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts in the years following their discovery, such as collisions between [[comet]]s and [[neutron star]]s.<ref>[[#HurleyBib|Hurley 2003]]</ref> Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their [[redshift]]s using optical [[spectroscopy]], and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and [[supernova]]e associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs. These facts definitively placed them in distant galaxies and also connected long GRBs with the explosion of massive stars, the only possible source for the energy outputs observed.

On November 21, 2013, [[NASA]] released detailed data about a gamma-ray burst, designated [[GRB 130427A]], that was observed on April 27, 2013.<ref name="NASA-20131121">{{cite web |author=Staff |title=NASA Sees 'Watershed' Cosmic Blast in Unique Detail |url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-sees-watershed-cosmic-blast-in-unique-detail/index.html |date=November 21, 2013 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=November 21, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="AP-20131121">{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |title='Monster' cosmic blast zipped harmlessly by Earth |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20131121/DAA77ED80.html |date=November 21, 2013 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=November 21, 2013 }}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of gamma-ray burst research}}
Gamma-ray bursts were first observed in the late 1960s by the U.S. [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] satellites, which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space. The United States suspected that the [[USSR]] might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the [[Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] in 1963. On July 2, 1967, at 14:19 [[UTC]], the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature.<ref name="FlashVela"/> Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent, the team at the [[Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]], led by [[Ray Klebesadel]], filed the data away for investigation. As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments, the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma-ray bursts in their data. By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites, the team was able to determine rough estimates for the [[Star position|sky positions]] of sixteen bursts<ref name="FlashVela">[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p.12<U+2013>16</ref> and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin.  The discovery was declassified and published in 1973 as an ''[[Astrophysical Journal]]'' article entitled "Observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts of Cosmic Origin".<ref>{{cite journal|bibcode=1973ApJ...182L..85K |title=Observations of Gamma-Ray Bursts of Cosmic Origin |author=Klebesadel R.W., Strong I.B., and Olson R.A. |year=1973 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=182 |pages=L85 |doi=10.1086/181225}}</ref>

[[Image:BATSE 2704.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Positions on the sky of all gamma-ray bursts detected during the BATSE mission.  The distribution is [[isotropic]], with no concentration towards the plane of the Milky Way, which runs horizontally through the center of the image.]]
Many theories were advanced to explain these bursts, most of which posited nearby sources within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. Little progress was made until the 1991 launch of the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer ([[CGRO#Instruments|BATSE]]) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector. This instrument provided crucial data indicating that the distribution of GRBs is [[Isotropy|isotropic]]<U+2014>not biased towards any particular direction in space, such as toward the [[galactic plane]] or the [[galactic center]].<ref>[[#Meegan|Meegan 1992]]</ref>  Because of the flattened shape of the Milky Way Galaxy, sources within our own galaxy would be strongly concentrated in or near the galactic plane.  The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way.<ref name="Vedrenne p. 16-40">[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne & Atteia 2009]], p. 16-40</ref><ref>[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p.36<U+2013>37</ref><ref>[[#Pac95|Paczy<U+0144>ski 1999]], p. 6</ref><ref name="Piran92">[[#Piran92|Piran 1992]]</ref>  However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.<ref name="Vedrenne p. 16-40"/><ref name="Lamb">[[#Lamb|Lamb 1995]]</ref>

=== Counterpart objects as candidate sources ===
For decades after the discovery of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including [[white dwarf]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[supernova]]e, [[globular cluster]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[Seyfert galaxies]], and [[BL Lac object]]s.<ref name="spatial">[[#HurleyConf|Hurley 1986]], p. 33</ref>  All such searches were unsuccessful,<ref group="nb" name="790305b">A notable exception is the [[GRB 790305b|5 March event]] of 1979, an extremely bright burst that was successfully localized to supernova remnant [[N49 (astronomy)|N49]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. This event is now interpreted as a [[magnetar]] [[Gamma-ray burst progenitors#Magnetar giant flares|giant flare]], more related to [[soft gamma repeater|SGR]] flares than "true" gamma-ray bursts.</ref> and in a few cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies.<ref>[[#Pedersen|Pedersen 1987]]</ref><ref>[[#Hurley92|Hurley 1992]]</ref>  Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.<ref name="CFishman"/>

[[Image:BeppoSAX.jpg|thumb|The Italian-Dutch satellite [[BeppoSAX]], launched in April 1996, provided the first accurate positions of gamma-ray bursts, allowing follow-up observations and identification of the sources.]]

=== Afterglow ===
Several models for the origin of gamma-ray bursts postulated<ref>[[#Pac93|Paczynski 1993]]</ref> that the initial burst of gamma rays should be followed by slowly fading emission at longer wavelengths created by collisions between the burst [[ejecta]] and interstellar gas. This fading emission would be called the "afterglow."  Early searches for this afterglow were unsuccessful, largely due to the difficulties in observing a burst's position at longer wavelengths immediately after the initial burst. The breakthrough came in February 1997 when the satellite [[BeppoSAX]] detected a gamma-ray burst ([[GRB 970228]]<ref group="nb" name="grbnames">GRBs are named after the date on which they are discovered: the first two digits being the year, followed by the two-digit month and two-digit day and a letter with the order they were detected during that day. The letter 'A' is appended to the name for the first burst identified, 'B' for the second, and so on. For bursts before the year 2010 this letter was only appended if more than one burst occurred that day.</ref>) and when the X-ray camera was pointed towards the direction from which the burst had originated, it detected fading X-ray emission.  The [[William Herschel Telescope]] identified a fading optical counterpart 20 hours after the burst.<ref>[[#Paradijs|van Paradijs 1997]]</ref> Once the GRB faded, deep imaging was able to identify a faint, distant host galaxy at the location of the GRB as pinpointed by the optical afterglow.<ref name="Vedrenne p. 90">[[#VedrenneAtteia|Vedrenne & Atteia 2009]], p. 90 <U+2013> 93</ref><ref>[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p. 102</ref>

Because of the very faint luminosity of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years.  Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, [[GRB 970508]]. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The [[absorption spectrum|spectrum]] of the object revealed a [[redshift]] of ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.835, placing the burst at a distance of roughly 6 billion&nbsp;[[light year]]s from Earth.<ref>[[#Reichart|Reichart 1995]]</ref> This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies.<ref name="Vedrenne p. 90"/><ref>[[#Schilling|Schilling 2002]], p. 118<U+2013>123</ref> Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, [[GRB 980425]] was followed within a day by a coincident bright supernova ([[SN 1998bw]]), indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue about the nature of the systems that produce GRBs.<ref name="98bw">[[#Galama|Galama 1998]]</ref>

[[Image:Swift spacecraft.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift Spacecraft]] launched in November 2004]]
BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory|CGRO]] (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the revolution in the study of gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion.  The first such mission, [[High Energy Transient Explorer|HETE-2]],<ref>[[#HETE|Ricker 2003]]</ref> launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period.  One of the most successful space missions to date, [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]], was launched in 2004 and as of 2013 is still operational.<ref>[[#NASA2008|McCray 2008]]</ref><ref>[[#Gehrels04|Gehrels 2004]]</ref>  Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically [[Slew (spacecraft)|slewed]] to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi]] mission was launched carrying the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor|Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor]], which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's [[Fermi LAT|Large Area Telescope]].  Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the [[Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network]]. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.<ref>[[#ROTSE|Akerlof 2003]]</ref><ref>[[#Akerlof99|Akerlof 1999]]</ref>

New developments over the past few years include the recognition of short gamma-ray bursts as a separate class (likely due to merging neutron stars and not associated with supernovae), the discovery of extended, erratic flaring activity at X-ray wavelengths lasting for many minutes after most GRBs, and the discovery of the most luminous ([[GRB 080319B]]) and the former most distant ([[GRB 090423]]) objects in the universe.<ref name="Bloom">[[#Bloom|Bloom 2009]]</ref><ref>[[#090423|Reddy 2009]]</ref> The most distant known GRB, [[GRB 090429B]], is now the most distant known object in the universe.

==Classification==
[[Image:GRB BATSE 12lightcurves.png|thumb|200px|left|Gamma-ray burst light curves]]
While most astronomical transient sources have simple and consistent time structures (typically a rapid brightening followed by gradual fading, as in a [[nova]] or [[supernova]]), the [[light curve]]s of gamma-ray bursts are extremely diverse and complex.<ref>[[#Katz|Katz 2002]], p. 37</ref>  No two gamma-ray burst light curves are identical,<ref>[[#Marani|Marani 1997]]</ref> with large variation observed in almost every property: the duration of observable emission can vary from milliseconds to tens of minutes, there can be a single peak or several individual subpulses, and individual peaks can be symmetric or with fast brightening and very slow fading. Some bursts are preceded by a "precursor" event, a weak burst that is then followed (after seconds to minutes of no emission at all) by the much more intense "true" bursting episode.<ref name="Lazzati">[[#Lazzati|Lazatti 2005]]</ref> The light curves of some events have extremely chaotic and complicated profiles with almost no discernible patterns.<ref name="CFishman">[[#CFishman|Fishman & Meegan 1995]]</ref>

Although some light curves can be roughly reproduced using certain simplified models,<ref>[[#Simic|Simi<U+0107> 2005]]</ref> little progress has been made in understanding the full diversity observed. Many classification schemes have been proposed, but these are often based solely on differences in the appearance of light curves and may not always reflect a true physical difference in the progenitors of the explosions.  However, plots of the distribution of the observed duration<ref group="nb" name="T90">The duration of a burst is typically measured by T90, the duration of the period which 90 percent of the burst's [[energy]] is emitted.  Recently some otherwise "short" GRBs have been shown to be followed by a second, much longer emission episode that when included in the burst light curve results in T90 durations of up to several minutes: these events are only short in the literal sense when this component is excluded.</ref> for a large number of gamma-ray bursts show a clear [[bimodal distribution|bimodality]], suggesting the existence of two separate populations:  a "short" population with an average duration of about 0.3 seconds and a "long" population with an average duration of about 30 seconds.<ref name="Kouveliotou">[[#Kouveliotou|Kouveliotou 1994]]</ref>  Both distributions are very broad with a significant overlap region in which the identity of a given event is not clear from duration alone. Additional classes beyond this two-tiered system have been proposed on both observational and theoretical grounds.<ref name="Horvath98">[[#Horvath98|Horvath 1998]]</ref><ref name="Hakkila">[[#Hakkila|Hakkila 2003]]</ref><ref name="Chattopadhyay">[[#Chattopadhyay|Chattopadhyay 2007]]</ref><ref name="Virgili">[[#Virgili|Virgili 2009]]</ref>

===Long gamma-ray bursts===
Most observed events have a duration of greater than two seconds and are classified as long gamma-ray bursts. Because these events constitute the majority of the population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows, they have been studied in much greater detail than their short counterparts. Almost every well-studied long gamma-ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation, and in many cases to a [[core-collapse supernova]] as well, unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars.<ref name="Woosley06">[[#Woosley06|Woosley & Bloom 2006]]</ref> Long GRB afterglow observations, at high redshift, are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star-forming regions.<ref name="Pontzen">[[#Pontzen|Pontzen et al 2010]]</ref> 

A unique gamma ray emission event, [[GRB 110328A]], lasting more than two and a half months was observed starting March 28, 2011, originating from the center of a small galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. The event is interpreted as a [[supermassive black hole]] devouring a star, most likely a white dwarf,<ref>[[#KrolikPiran|Krolick & Piran 11]]</ref> and emitting its beam of radiation towards Earth. It could thus be viewed as a temporarily active [[blazar]] (a type of [[quasar]]).<ref>[[#Daily|Science Daily 2011]]</ref><ref name = "Levan11">[[#Levan11|Levan 2011]]</ref><ref name = "Bloom11">[[#Bloom11|Bloom 2011]]</ref>

===Short gamma-ray bursts===

[[File:Hubble captures infrared glow of a kilonova blast.jpg|thumb|Hubble captures infrared glow of a [[kilonova blast]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble captures infrared glow of a kilonova blast|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1329a/|work=Image Gallery|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> ]]

Events with a duration of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins.<ref name=r1>[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/short_burst_oct5.html In a Flash NASA Helps Solve 35-year-old Cosmic Mystery]. NASA (2005-10-05) The 30% figure is given here, as well as afterglow discussion.</ref> Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] and the central regions of large [[galaxy cluster]]s.<ref>[[#Bloom06|Bloom 2006]]</ref><ref>[[#Hjorth|Hjorth 2005]]</ref><ref>[[#Berger07|Berger 2007]]</ref><ref>[[#Gehrels05|Gehrels 2005]]</ref>  This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.<ref name = "Zhang">[[#Zhang09|Zhang 2009]]</ref> 

The true nature of these objects (or even whether the current classification scheme is accurate) remains unknown, although the leading hypothesis is that they originate from the mergers of binary neutron stars<ref>[[#Nakar07|Nakar 2007]]</ref> or a neutron star with a [[black hole]]. The mean duration of these events of 0.2 seconds suggests a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms: less than 0.2 light-seconds (about 37,000 miles<U+2014>four times the Earth's diameter and 5% of the Sun's diameter.) This alone suggests a very compact object as the source. The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole in less than two seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally-disrupted neutron star material (no longer [[neutronium]]) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, over a longer period of time.<ref name=r1/> A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from [[soft gamma repeaters]] in nearby galaxies.<ref name="Frederiks">[[#Frederiks|Frederiks 2008]]</ref><ref>[[#Hurley05|Hurley 2005]]</ref>

==Energetics and beaming==
[[Image:GRB080319B illustration NASA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Artist's illustration of a bright gamma-ray burst occurring in a star-forming region. Energy from the explosion is beamed into two narrow, oppositely directed jets.]]
Gamma-ray bursts are very bright as observed from Earth despite their typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a [[bolometric magnitude|bolometric]] flux comparable to a bright star of our galaxy despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. [[GRB 080319B]], for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a [[visible magnitude]] of 5.8,<ref name="Racusin">[[#Racusin08|Racusin 2008]]</ref> comparable to that of the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the [[Mass-energy equivalence|rest-mass energy]] of the [[Sun]] (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).<ref name="Bloom">[[#Bloom|Bloom 2009]]</ref>

No known process in the Universe can produce this much energy in such a short time. However, gamma-ray bursts are thought to be highly focused explosions, with most of the explosion energy collimated into a narrow [[relativistic jet|jet]] traveling at speeds exceeding 99.995% of the [[speed of light]].<ref>[[#Rykoff|Rykoff 2009]]</ref><ref>[[#Abdo|Abdo 2009]]</ref>  The approximate angular width of the jet (that is, the degree of beaming) can be estimated directly by observing the achromatic "jet breaks" in afterglow light curves: a time after which the slowly decaying afterglow abruptly begins to fade rapidly as the jet slows down and can no longer [[relativistic beaming|beam]] its radiation as effectively.<ref name="Sari99">[[#Sari99|Sari 1999]]</ref><ref>[[#Burrows|Burrows 2006]]</ref>  Observations suggest significant variation in the jet angle from between 2 and 20 degrees.<ref name="Frail">[[#Frail|Frail 2001]]</ref>

Because their energy is strongly beamed, the gamma rays emitted by most bursts are expected to miss the Earth and never be detected. When a gamma-ray burst is pointed towards Earth, the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter than it would have been were its energy emitted spherically.  When this effect is taken into account, typical gamma-ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 10<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;J, or about 1/2000 of a [[Solar mass]] energy equivalent<ref name="Frail"/> -- which is still many times the mass energy equivalent of the Earth (about 5.5x10<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;J).  This is comparable to the energy released in a bright [[Typr Ib supernova|type Ib/c]] [[supernova]] and within the range of theoretical models. Very bright supernovae have been observed to accompany several of the nearest GRBs.<ref name="98bw"/>  Additional support for strong beaming in GRBs has come from observations of strong asymmetries in the spectra of nearby [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|type Ic supernova]]<ref>[[#Mazzali|Mazzali 2005]]</ref> and from radio observations taken long after bursts when their jets are no longer relativistic.<ref>[[#Frail2000|Frail 2000]]</ref>

Short GRBs appear to come from a lower-redshift (i.e. less distant) population and are less luminous than long GRBs.<ref name="SHBhosts">[[#Prochaska|Prochaska 2006]]</ref> The degree of beaming in short bursts has not been accurately measured, but as a population they are likely less collimated than long GRBs<ref>[[#Watson|Watson 2006]]</ref> or possibly not collimated at all in some cases.<ref>[[#Grupe|Grupe 2006]]</ref>

==Progenitors==
{{Main|Gamma-ray burst progenitors}}
[[Image:Wolf rayet2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] image of [[Wolf<U+2013>Rayet star]] [[WR 124]] and its surrounding nebula.  Wolf<U+2013>Rayet stars are candidates for being progenitors of long-duration GRBs.]]
Because of the immense distances of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, identification of the progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is particularly challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae and the fact that their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the [[Hypernova|collapsar]] model,<ref>[[#Mac99|MacFadyen 1999]]</ref> in which the core of an extremely massive, low-[[metallicity]], rapidly rotating star collapses into a [[black hole]] in the final stages of its [[stellar evolution|evolution]]. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density [[accretion disk]]. The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of [[relativistic jet]]s out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed [[magnetar]],<ref>[[#Metzger|Metzger 2007]]</ref> although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.

The closest analogs within the Milky Way galaxy of the stars producing long gamma-ray bursts are likely the [[Wolf<U+2013>Rayet star]]s, extremely hot and massive stars which have shed most or all of their hydrogen due to [[radiation pressure]].  [[Eta Carinae]] and [[WR 104]] have been cited as possible future gamma-ray burst progenitors.<ref>[[#Plait|Plait 2008]]</ref>  It is unclear if any star in the Milky Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma-ray burst.<ref name="Stanek">[[#Stanek|Stanek 2006]]</ref>

The massive-star model probably does not explain all types of gamma-ray burst. There is strong evidence that some short-duration gamma-ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and where no massive stars are present, such as elliptical galaxies and [[galaxy halo]]s.<ref name="SHBhosts" /> The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma-ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars.  According to this model, the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other due to the release of energy via [[gravitational radiation]]<ref>[[#Abbott|Abbott 2007]]</ref><ref>[[#Kochanek|Kochanek 1993]]</ref> until the neutron stars suddenly rip each other apart due to [[tidal forces]] and collapse into a single black hole. The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy, analogous to the collapsar model. Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma-ray bursts, including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole, the accretion-induced collapse of a neutron star, or the [[black hole evaporation|evaporation]] of [[primordial black hole]]s.<ref>[[#Vietri|Vietri 1998]]</ref><ref>[[#Mac2006|MacFadyen 2006]]</ref><ref>[[#Blinnikov|Blinnikov 1984]]</ref><ref name="cline">[[#Cline|Cline 1996]]</ref>

An alternative explanation proposed by [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] is that in the course of a gravitational collapse and in reaching the event horizon of a black hole, all matter disintegrates into a burst of gamma radiation of what has been called a [[Firewall (physics)|black hole firewall]].<ref>Winterberg, Friedwardt (2001 Aug 29).

The means by which gamma-ray bursts convert energy into radiation remains poorly understood, and as of 2010 there was still no generally accepted model for how this process occurs.<ref>[[#Stern|Stern 2007]]</ref> Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma-ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light-curves, spectra, and other characteristics.<ref>[[#GFishman|Fishman, G. 1995]]</ref> Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions: some gamma-ray bursts may convert as much as half (or more) of the explosion energy into gamma-rays.<ref>[[#FanPiran|Fan & Piran 2006]]</ref> Recent observations of the bright optical counterpart of [[GRB 080319B]], whose light curve was correlated with the gamma-ray light curve,<ref name="Racusin"/> has suggested that [[Compton scattering|inverse Compton]] may be the dominant process in some events.  In this model, pre-existing low-energy [[photons]] are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion, augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma-rays.<ref>[[#Wozniak09|Wozniak 2009]]</ref>

The nature of the longer-wavelength afterglow emission (ranging from [[X-ray]] through [[radio waves|radio]]) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself takes the form of matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding [[interstellar gas]], it creates a [[relativistic speed|relativistic]] [[shock wave]] that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as [[synchrotron]] emission across most of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref>[[#Meszaros|Meszaros 1997]]</ref><ref>[[#Sari98|Sari 1998]]</ref> This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.<ref>[[#Nousek|Nousek 2006]]</ref>

==Rates and potential effects on life on Earth==
All the bursts astronomers have recorded so far have come from distant galaxies far from the solar system and have been harmless to Earth. However, if a burst occurred within the Milky Way galaxy and were aimed straight at Earth, the effects could be devastating for the planet. Currently-orbiting satellites detect an average of about one gamma-ray burst per day. The closest known GRB so far was [[GRB 031203]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/04_releases/press_080404.html|title=Chandra Contributes to ESA's Integral Detection of Closest Gamma-Ray Burst|work=chandra.harvard.edu|date=2004-08-04}}</ref>  

Measuring the exact rate is difficult, but for a galaxy of approximately the same size as the [[Milky Way]], the expected rate (for long GRBs) is about one burst every 100,000 to 1,000,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21082617|title=Gamma-ray burst 'hit Earth in 8th Century'|publisher=BBC|work=Rebecca Morelle|date=2013-01-21|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref> Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rates of short GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.

Gamma-ray bursts are thought to emerge mainly from the poles of a collapsing star. This creates two oppositely-shining beams of radiation shaped like narrow cones. Planets not lying in these cones would be comparatively safe; the chief worry is for those that do.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44823014/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.Tqoe10K5PvI | title=Can gamma-ray bursts destroy life on Earth? | publisher=MSN | author=Welsh, Jennifer  | date=2011-07-10 | accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref>

Depending on distance, a gamma flash and its [[ultraviolet radiation]] could damage even the most radiation resistant organism known, the bacterium ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]''. These bacteria can endure 2,000 times more radiation than humans. Life surviving an initial onslaught would have to contend with a potentially lethal aftereffect, depletion of the atmosphere's protective ozone layer by the burst.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world-science.net/exclusives/070226_grb-life.htm |title=Death from across the galaxy |publisher=World-science.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref>

=== Hypothetical effects of gamma-ray bursts in the past  ===
GRBs close enough to affect life in some way might occur once every five million years or so <U+2013> around a thousand times since life on Earth  began.<ref>New Scientist print edition, 15 December 2001, p 10). John Scalo and Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas at Austin</ref>

The major [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction event]] of 450 million years ago may have been caused by a GRB. The [[late Ordovician]] species of [[trilobite]] that spent some of its life in the plankton layer near the ocean surface was much harder hit than deep-water dwellers, which tended to stay put within quite restricted areas. Usually it is the more widely spread species that fare better in extinction, and hence this unusual pattern could be explained by a GRB, which would probably devastate creatures living on land and near the ocean surface, but leave deep-sea creatures relatively unharmed.<ref name="Melott2004"/>

A case has been made [[774%E2%80%93775_carbon-14_spike]] that the cause of the carbon 14 (and Be 10) spike in 774 or 775 was the result of a short GRB.

=== Hypothetical effects of gamma-ray bursts in the future ===
The greatest danger is believed to come from [[Wolf<U+2013>Rayet stars]], regarded by astronomers as likely GRB candidates. When such stars transition to supernovae, they may emit intense beams of gamma rays, and if Earth were to lie in the beam zone, devastating effects may occur.  Gamma rays would not penetrate Earth's atmosphere to impact the surface directly, but they would chemically damage the [[stratosphere]].<ref name="Melott2004"/>

For example, if [[WR 104]] were to hit Earth with a burst of 10 seconds duration, its gamma rays could deplete about 25 percent of the world's [[ozone layer]].  This would result in [[mass extinction]], food chain depletion, and starvation.  The side of Earth facing the GRB would receive potentially lethal [[Ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]], which can cause radiation sickness in the short term, and in the long term result in serious impacts to life due to ozone layer depletion.<ref name="Melott2004"/>

=== Effects after exposure to the gamma-ray burst on Earth's atmosphere ===
Longer-term, gamma ray energy may cause chemical reactions involving [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] [[molecules]] which may create [[nitrogen oxide]] then [[nitrogen dioxide]] gas, causing [[photochemical smog]]. The GRB may produce enough of the gas to cover the sky and darken it. Gas would prevent sunlight from reaching Earth's surface, producing a [[cosmic winter]] effect, and may even further deplete the [[ozone layer]], thus exposing the whole of the Earth to all types of [[cosmic radiation]].<ref name="Melott2004"/>
