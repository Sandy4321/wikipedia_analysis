'''Robert Paisley''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (23 January 1919 <U+2013> 14 February 1996) was an [[England|English]] [[Association football|footballer]] and [[Manager (association football)|manager]] who spent almost fifty years with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] as a [[right-back]], [[Physiotherapy|physiotherapist]], [[coach (sport)|coach]], and finally [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. His time and achievements as Liverpool manager has led to Paisley being regarded as one of the greatest football managers of all time, and he remains to date the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winning managers#Managers with multiple titles|only manager in football history]] to have won three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]].

Born in [[County Durham]], Paisley spent his youth playing for [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]] before he signed for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 1939, although the [[Second World War]] prevented him from playing until 1946. In 1947, he broke into the first-team as Liverpool won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title for the first time in 24 years. In 1951, he was made [[Captain (association football)|club captain]], and he remained with Liverpool until he retired from playing in 1954.

He stayed with Liverpool after retiring, becoming the reserve team coach, as well as serving as the club's physiotherapist. By this time, Liverpool had been relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and their facilities were in decline. In December 1959, [[Bill Shankly]] was appointed Liverpool manager, and he promoted Paisley to work with him as an assistant, along with [[Joe Fagan]] and [[Reuben Bennett]]. Under their leadership, the fortunes of Liverpool turned around dramatically as they were promoted back to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].

In 1974, Shankly retired as manager, and Paisley was quickly appointed as his successor. Paisley went on to lead Liverpool to a period of unprecedented [[English football|domestic]] and [[European football|European dominance]], winning 20 honours in 9 years <U+2013> six [[Football League First Division|League Championship]]s, three [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s, six [[FA Charity Shield|Charity Shield]]s, three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]], one [[UEFA Cup 1975-76|UEFA Cup]] and one [[UEFA Super Cup]]. He also won the [[LMA Manager of the Year|Manager of the Year Award]] a record six times, before retiring in 1983, when he was awarded an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]].

==Early life==
Paisley was born in [[Hetton-le-Hole]] in [[County Durham]], the second-oldest of four brothers. His father, Sam, was a [[miner]], and his mother, Emily, a [[housewife]]. After leaving school at the age of 13, Paisley initially worked alongside his father at the pit. He later trained to become a bricklayer, but was spotted by talent scouts and began to play football professionally.<ref>http://www.bobpaisley.com/article/2295</ref>

After spending his youth playing for [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]], Paisley was signed by [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in May 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/team/past_players/managers/paisley/ |title=Bob Paisley OBE MSc [Hon]: Player (1945-54) and Manager (1974-83) |work=www.liverpoolfc.tv |publisher=Liverpool FC |date= |accessdate=18 August 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050425003832/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/team/past_players/managers/paisley/ |archivedate=25 April 2005}}</ref> However, as with so many of his generation, the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] delayed the start of Paisley's career. He saw active service in [[Italy]], and played a part in the [[liberation of Rome]] from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].

==Playing career==
He eventually made his debut on 5 January 1946 in Liverpool's first post-war competitive match, which was an [[FA Cup]] 3rd round, 1st leg away match at [[Sealand Road]], the home ground of [[Chester City F.C.|Chester]]. Liverpool won the game 2-0. Paisley's first goal didn't come until the 1 May 1948 in a League game at [[Anfield]], against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Paisley's 22nd-minute strike along with a [[Jack Balmer]] goal in the 80th were enough to help the Reds win 2-1.

In the first full season after the war, 1946<U+2013>47, he helped Liverpool to their first league title in 24 years, making 34 appearances in the 42-match season. He remained a fixture in the side, appearing in 30+ matches in 1947/48 and 1948/49 and 28 in 1949/50, a season of both highs and lows for Paisley who scored the opening goal of a 2-0 FA Cup semi-final win over [[Merseyside]] rivals [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] only to be dropped for the Final against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], the club's first appearance at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Paisley later said that the experience stood him in good stead when it came to telling players they were not going to play in big games as he knew how they felt. Paisley became club captain the following season.

==Coaching career==
After retiring as a [[one-club man]] in 1954, he joined the back room staff as self-taught [[Physiotherapist]] and had a knack of being able to diagnose a player's injury just by looking at them. He later became a coach for the reserves. The arrival of [[Bill Shankly]] as manager in December 1959 transformed the fortunes of the club. Shankly utilised [[The Boot Room]] for a second purpose, a room for coaches' meetings. Paisley was one of Shankly's founder members of the boot room staff along with [[Joe Fagan]] and [[Reuben Bennett]]. Under Shankly's management Liverpool won three league titles, two FA Cups and a UEFA Cup over the next fifteen years.<ref name = "rb">{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=610 |title=Reuben Bennett |publisher=Qosfc.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
Following victory in the [[1974 FA Cup Final]], [[Bill Shankly]] suddenly announced his retirement. In the wake of the shock announcement, the directors of Liverpool turned to the unassuming Paisley as his replacement, in the hope of maintaining continuity.<ref name = "rb" /><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/billshankly.htm |title=Hall of Fame 2006 |work= |publisher=The National Football Museum |first=Robert |last=Galvin|accessdate=18 August 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223211613/http://www.nationalfootballmuseum.com/pages/fame/Inductees/billshankly.htm |archivedate=23 December 2007}}</ref>

Paisley would prove to be a huge success at Liverpool, winning at least one trophy in eight of his nine years as manager. Hugely disappointed by finishing second in his first season as manager, the team went on to win the title in 1976. This period marked the beginning of Liverpool's dominance of English and European football, as the team went on to become Champions on six occasions - finishing second twice - as well as winning three [[Football League Cup|League Cups]], one [[UEFA Cup]], one [[UEFA Super Cup]], six [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]]s and, most significantly, three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]s.<ref name = "rb" />

Liverpool's dominance of the era in English and European football was primarily challenged by [[Nottingham Forest]] under [[Brian Clough]], and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] under [[Ron Saunders]] and [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]]. Paisley remains the only man in history to manage three European Cup-winning sides.<ref name = "rb" /> He also won an unprecedented six Manager of the Year Awards. The only trophy that Paisley failed to win as manager was the [[FA Cup]], although Liverpool would be runners-up in [[1977 FA Cup Final|1977]].

He was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in 1977 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] on board a coach in central London.

==Retirement and death==
Paisley retired as Liverpool manager at the end of the [[1982-83 in English football|1982-83 season]], having spent 44 unbroken years at the club in different capacities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/1417739.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; LIVERPOOL &#124; Liverpool legend Fagan dies |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-07-02 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-football.co.uk/story/0,19239,11035_2840818,00.html |title=Football / Features / Fidelity In Football |publisher=Itv-football.co.uk |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> He was replaced by [[Joe Fagan]], his assistant, who would go on to win Liverpool their fourth [[European Cup]].

He worked informally as a consultant and advisor to [[Kenny Dalglish]] for two years after the latter's appointment as player-manager in 1985, before being appointed as a club director. In early 1986, then aged 66, he was interviewed by the [[Football Association of Ireland]] with a view to taking charge of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland football team]]. [[Jack Charlton]] was eventually given the job instead however.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G-JAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=36YMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2563,7070663&dq=bob-paisley&hl=en Evening Times]</ref>

He continued to serve Liverpool as a director until he retired in early 1992 due to ill health, having been diagnosed with the early stages of [[Alzheimer's Disease]], something which had become apparent in his early seventies when he was unable to remember his way home when driving back from [[Anfield]].<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|last=Shea |first=Julian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/4753743.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; FA Cup &#124; FA Cup flashback |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

He died on 14 February 1996 at the age of 77, and after his death was honoured by the club with the opening of the Paisley Gates at one of the entrances to Anfield, complementing the existing Shankly Gates.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaysun/100northeastheroes/tm_headline=&method=full&objectid=18737755&siteid=50081-name_page.html Sunday Sun - Bob Paisley - 100 North East Heroes]</ref> He was buried in the churchyard of St Peter's Church in [[Woolton]], [[Liverpool]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=8677458 |title=Bob Paisley (1919 - 1996) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Paisley married his wife Jessie, a school teacher, in 1946, and they had two sons, Robert and Graham, and a daughter, Christine.<ref>[http://www.shankly.com/webs/billshankly/default.aspx?aid=2295 Bill Shankly]</ref> He lived with his family in [[Liverpool]] until his death in 1996.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://icnewcastle.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaysun/100northeastheroes/tm_headline=&method=full&objectid=18737755&siteid=50081-name_page.html Sunday Sun - Bob Paisley - 100 North East Heroes]</ref> His wife Jessie died in the early hours of 8 February 2012 as the result of a heart infection, aged 96.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2012/02/08/jessie-paisley-wife-of-legendary-liverpool-fc-manager-bob-passes-away-aged-96-100252-30291261/ Jessie Paisley] Liverpool Local News - Liverpool Echo</ref>
