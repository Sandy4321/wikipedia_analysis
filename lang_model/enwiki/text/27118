'''Black Country Communion''' (abbreviated '''BCC''') was an English-American [[hard rock]] band based in Los Angeles, California. Formed in 2009, the band was a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] composed of bassist and vocalist [[Glenn Hughes]], guitarist and vocalist [[Joe Bonamassa]], drummer [[Jason Bonham]], and keyboardist [[Derek Sherinian]]. Originally formed by Hughes and Bonamassa with the help of producer [[Kevin Shirley]], the group released its [[Black Country Communion (album)|self-titled debut album]] in September 2010. Second album ''[[2 (Black Country Communion album)|2]]'' followed in June 2011, which was promoted on a European tour later in the year. The band released its third and final album ''[[Afterglow (Black Country Communion album)|Afterglow]]'' in October 2012.

Following a performance together in Los Angeles, Hughes and Bonamassa started the side project in November 2009, recruiting Bonham and Sherinian on the advice of Shirley to finalise the lineup of the band. The name Black Country Communion is derived from the term [[Black Country]], which refers to the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] area of England where Hughes and Bonham grew up. The group's sound is intentionally reminiscent of popular [[classic rock]] groups of the 1970s, reflecting the previous work of frontman Hughes as well as the link between Bonham and his father [[John Bonham|John]]'s band [[Led Zeppelin]].

In March 2013, after months of public tensions within the band, Bonamassa announced that he was no longer a member of Black Country Communion, with the question over whether the group would continue with another guitarist unclear. Days later, Hughes confirmed that the band was officially over, hinting that he would continue working with Bonham and Sherinian under a new collective name. Sherinian later joined Bonamassa's touring band, and Hughes and Bonham formed [[California Breed]] with guitarist Andrew Watt.

==Style and songwriting==
As a supergroup, Black Country Communion's style is often described as a mix of various different sounds and influences. Particular significance is attributed to the band's mix of [[blues rock]] (attributed primarily to Bonamassa's sound and influences) and [[classic rock]] (originating from Hughes' previous work with Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, and Bonham's tie with Led Zeppelin),<ref name="mojo"/> with some critics going as far as claiming the group's sound is based on "the vintage Deep Purple template".<ref name="allmusic"/> In reviews for the band's second album ''2'', a number of critics compared the sound of the group to that of drummer Bonham's father's band Led Zeppelin <U+2013> Eduardo Rivadavia of website [[AllMusic]] noted that the album "sounds like the baby of drummer Jason Bonham",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/2-mw0002143032 |title=2 <U+2013> Black Country Communion |author=Eduardo Rivadavia |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}</ref> while Paul Cole of newspaper ''[[Sunday Mercury]]'' claimed it is "haunted by the spirit of Zeppelin".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sundaymercury.net/entertainment-news/pop-music-news/cd-reviews/2011/06/12/black-country-communion-black-country-communion-2-66331-28857621/ |title=Black Country Communion: Black Country Communion 2 |author=Paul Cole |work=[[Sunday Mercury]] |date=June 12, 2011 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}</ref> Speaking about how he intended the style of the band to appear, Hughes has proclaimed that BCC "are a [[rock and roll]] band in the true sense of the word".<ref name="nightwatcher">{{cite web |url=http://houseofrockinterviews.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/fate-karma-and-throwing-down-that-rock.html |title=Fate, Karma And Throwing Down That Rock and Roll Gauntlet : An Exclusive Interview with Glenn Hughes Of Black Country Communion |publisher=Nightwatcher's House of Rock Interviews |date=September 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 11, 2014 }}</ref>

Traditionally the writing processes for BCC's albums have been led by Hughes, who wrote the majority of the lyrics for both ''Black Country Communion'' and ''2''.<ref name="bcnotes">{{cite AV media notes |title=Black Country |titlelink=Black Country (album) |others=Black Country Communion |year=2010 |publisher=J&R Adventures }}</ref><ref name="2notes">{{cite AV media notes |title=2 |titlelink=2 (Black Country Communion album) |others=Black Country Communion |year=2011 |publisher=J&R Adventures }}</ref> The majority of the music on ''Black Country Communion'' was composed by Hughes and Bonamassa, with Shirley increasing his composition presence for the second album.<ref name="bcnotes"/><ref name="2notes"/> Noting the extensive touring commitments of Bonamassa, Hughes has claimed that he was "left as the keeper of the keys to write [the band's] albums", noting that for each record <U+2013> which have been continuations of their predecessors <U+2013> he has had more and more time to write material (six weeks for ''Black Country Communion'', four months for ''2'', and six months for ''Afterglow'').<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=175109 |title=Black Country Communion to Begin Work on New Album This Weekend |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]] |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}</ref> Talking about the writing of the first album, Hughes has compared the approach of himself and Bonamassa to such songwriting duos as [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]] of Led Zeppelin, [[Jagger/Richards|Mick Jagger and Keith Richards]] of [[The Rolling Stones]], and [[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] of [[Aerosmith]].<ref name="nightwatcher"/>
