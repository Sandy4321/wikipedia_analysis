'''New York State Route&nbsp;118''' ('''NY&nbsp;118''') is a north<U+2013>south [[state highway]] that extends for {{convert|10.71|mi|2}} in [[Downstate New York]] in the United States. Much of the highway is located within [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]; however, a small portion of the route near the northern terminus is situated in [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]]. The southern terminus of the route is at an intersection with [[New York State Route 100|NY&nbsp;100]] in the town of [[Yorktown, New York|Yorktown]]. Its northern terminus is at a junction with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;6]] (US&nbsp;6) in the town of [[Carmel, New York|Carmel]]. NY&nbsp;118 passes through the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]]s of [[Yorktown Heights, New York|Yorktown Heights]] and Amawalk, where it [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s with [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] and [[New York State Route 35|NY&nbsp;35]]. The route was assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]]; however, it was initially routed on the portion of modern NY&nbsp;100 and US&nbsp;202 between the [[New Croton Reservoir]] and [[Croton Falls, New York|Croton Falls]]. It was moved onto its current alignment in the late 1930s.

NY&nbsp;118 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 100|NY&nbsp;100]] north of [[New Croton Reservoir|Croton Lake]] in the town of [[Yorktown, New York|Yorktown]]. It heads westward as Saw Mill River Road, following the northern edge of the reservoir for {{convert|1|mi|1}} to an intersection with [[New York State Route 129|NY&nbsp;129]]. Here, the northern lake perimeter road becomes Croton Dam Road and continues west as NY&nbsp;129 while Saw Mill River Road and NY&nbsp;118 turn northward, passes through mostly residential areas as it heads toward the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Yorktown Heights, New York|Yorktown Heights]]. In the center of the hamlet, NY&nbsp;118 enters a large commercial district based around NY&nbsp;118's junction with [[New York State Route 35|NY&nbsp;35]] and [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]].<ref name="yahoo">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=41.287515&lon=-73.76561&zoom=13&q1=41.232048%2C-73.767261&q2=41.255754%2C-73.787527&q3=41.344987%2C-73.757015 |title=overview map of NY 118 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref>

NY&nbsp;118 joins US&nbsp;202 and NY&nbsp;35 here, forming a three-way [[overlap (road)|overlap]] that extends northeasterly into the town of [[Somers, New York|Somers]]. At the hamlet of Amawalk, NY&nbsp;35 splits off to the east on Amawalk Road while US&nbsp;202 and NY&nbsp;118 continue northeastward along the western edge of the [[Amawalk Reservoir]] on Tomahawk Street. The overlap between US&nbsp;202 and NY&nbsp;118 ends at the northern edge of the reservoir, at which point US&nbsp;202 leaves to the east on Lincolndale Road. NY&nbsp;118, meanwhile, continues northward through residential neighborhoods into [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]]. Just past the county line, NY&nbsp;118 makes a 90-degree turn to the west onto Baldwin Place Road, then crossing the Putnam County Rail-Trail. The route ends {{convert|0.25|mi|2}} later at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] in the [[Carmel, New York|Carmel]] hamlet of Baldwin Place.<ref name="yahoo" />

==History==
The roadways that makeup NY&nbsp;118 through [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] and [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam counties]] was taken over and constructed between 1903 and 1907. The first two segments, unsigned State Highway&nbsp;148 (SH&nbsp;148), which was NY&nbsp;118 between a point north of [[New York State Route 129|NY&nbsp;129]] to Allan Avenue in [[Yorktown Heights, New York|Yorktown Heights]] along with a segment along the [[New Croton Reservoir]] and SH&nbsp;149, which went from Allan Avenue all the way to [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]] in [[Baldwin Place, New York|Baldwin Place]], were both contracted for improvement on June 16, 1903. The contract on SH&nbsp;148, {{convert|3.48|mi|km}} long, was completed August 5, 1905 at the cost of $34,272.91 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|34272.91|1907|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), half paid by the state. The contract on SH&nbsp;149, {{convert|6.62|mi|km}} long, cost $51,232.71 (1905&nbsp;USD) and was completed on October 28, 1904. The other portion of NY&nbsp;118, SH&nbsp;405, made up part of [[New York State Route 100|NY&nbsp;100]], was contracted on September 20, 1907 at the cost of $17,605 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|17605|1907|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). This portion of NY&nbsp;118 and NY&nbsp;100 was completed and accepted into the state highway system on November 21, 1908.<ref name="1922book">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lhlbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80 |author=State of New York Commission of Highways |title=Tables Giving Detailed Information and Present Status of All State, County and Federal Aid Highways |year=1922 |publisher=J.

NY&nbsp;118 was assigned as part of the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]]; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY&nbsp;118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY&nbsp;100 and [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] to a terminus at [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] in [[Croton Falls, New York|Croton Falls]] while all of what is now NY&nbsp;118 was part of NY&nbsp;100. At the time, NY&nbsp;100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US&nbsp;6 near [[Mahopac Falls, New York|Mahopac Falls]].<ref name="1930map">{{cite map |title=Road Map of New York |year=1930 |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company of New York]] |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref> In June 1934, the portion of NY&nbsp;118 between [[Somers, New York|Somers]] and Croton Falls became [[overlap (road)|concurrent]] to US&nbsp;202, a new interstate route extending from [[Delaware]] to [[Maine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us202.cfm |title=U.S. 202 <U+2013> Maine to Delaware |last=Weingroff |first=Richard |date=January 9, 2009 |work=Highway History |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide <U+2013> New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> The alignments of NY&nbsp;100 and NY&nbsp;118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped {{circa|1939}}, placing NY&nbsp;118 on its modern alignment.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York Road Map for 1938 |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1938 |cartography=General Drafting}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Standard Oil Company]] |year=1939 |cartography=General Drafting}}</ref> NY&nbsp;118 initially continued north to [[New York State Route 6N|NY&nbsp;6N]] over NY&nbsp;100's original alignment;<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=Esso |year=1940 |cartography=General Drafting}}</ref> however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Pictorial Guide |publisher=Esso |year=1942 |cartography=General Drafting}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Pennsylvania |publisher=[[Texas Oil Company]] |year=1946 |cartography=Rand McNally and Company}}</ref>
