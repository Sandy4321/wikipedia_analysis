'''Newport RUFC''' are an [[England|English]] [[Rugby union|rugby]] team that play at the Old Showground, just outside the town of [[Newport, Shropshire|Newport]], [[Shropshire]]. They currently play in the [[National League 3 Midlands]], a fifth tier league in the [[English rugby union system]].

==History==
The earliest recorded rugby being played in Newport was in 1871 when [[Adams' Grammar School]] (located in Newport) started playing the game, and this led to a game being played between the school and a town team, on Chetwynd End. In 1876 the town team played their first game representing the town against [[Stafford]], which resulted in a loss. The team played various games over the next few years, in either Newport or [[Shifnal]], before breaking due to the World Wars.

After the wars an ex-[[Torquay]] player '''Roy <U+201C>Squash<U+201D> Lemon''' settled in Newport and set about reforming the team, which came about in 1947, with the start of the Newport (Salop) Rugby Union Football Club. ("Salop" being an alternative name for the county.)

Newport have gone on to become the most successful and highest-ranking team in Shropshire.
