'''HMAS ''Vampire'' (D68/I68)''' was a [[V and W class destroyer|V class]] destroyer of the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) and [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). Launched in 1917 as HMS ''Wallace'', the ship was renamed and commissioned into the RN later that year. ''Vampire'' was loaned to the RAN in 1933, and operated as a depot tender until just before World War II. Reactivated for war service, the destroyer served in the Mediterranean as part of the [[Scrap Iron Flotilla]], and was escorting the British warships {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} during [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|their loss to Japanese aircraft]] in the South China Sea in December 1941. ''Vampire'' was sunk on 9 April 1942 by Japanese aircraft while sailing with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} from Trincomalee.

==Construction==
The destroyer was one of five [[V and W class destroyer#Admiralty V class leaders|Admiralty V class]] [[flotilla leader]]s ordered by the RN in the 1916<U+2013>17 construction program.<ref name=Cassells143>Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', p. 143</ref> Originally, there were to be differences in design between the V class leaders and the rest of the V class destroyers, but in order to save time in designing the destroyers, changes were limited to the layout of the bridge and accommodation areas.<ref name=Cassells143/>

''Vampire'' had a standard [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] of 1,188 tons, and a deep load displacement of 1,489 tons.<ref name=Cassells142.3/> She was {{convert|312|ft|0.75|in}} in [[length overall]] and {{convert|300|ft}} long [[between perpendiculars]], with a beam of {{convert|29|ft|6.25|in}}, and a maximum draught of {{convert|13|ft|8.75|in}}.<ref name=Cassells142.3/> Propulsion machiney consisted of three White Forster boilers supplying two Brown-Curtis steam turbines, which provided {{convert|27,000|shp}} to the destroyer's two propellers.<ref name=Cassells142.3/> Maximum speed was {{convert|34|kn}}, and ''Vampire'' could sail {{convert|3500|nmi}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.<ref name=Cassells142.3/> The standard ship's company was made up of 6 officers and 113 sailors.<ref name=Cassells142.3/>

Main armament for a V class destroyer consisted of four [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4}} Mark V guns]].<ref name=Cassells142.3/> This was supplemented by a [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder gun]] (with a second installed in January 1942), two twin [[Lewis gun]] mountings, a single Lewis gun (later replaced by a 4-barrel Vickers .303 gun), and two torpedo tube sets (initially 3-tube, later replaced by 4-tube sets).<ref name=Cassells142.3/> Four depth charge chutes were fitted during construction, with two depth charge throwers installed later; the destroyer could carry up to 50 charges.<ref name=Cassells142.3/>

The ship was laid down as HMS ''Wallace'' by [[J. Samuel White|J. Samuel White & Co Ltd]] at [[Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] on 10 October 1916, and was launched on 21 May 1917.<ref name=Cassells142.3/> In July 1917, the ship was renamed ''Vampire'', and was commissioned into the RN on 22 September 1917.<ref name=Cassells142.3>Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', pp. 142<U+2013>3</ref>

==Operational history==
===RN service===
On entering service, ''Vampire'' was initially assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla.<ref name=Mason>{{cite web |url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-09VW-Vampire.htm |title=Australian destroyer HMAS Vampire |last=Mason |first=Geoffrey B. |date=12 June 2011 |work=Service histories of Royal Navy warships in World War 2 |publisher=NavalHistory.net |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> After the end of World War I, the destroyer saw service in British waters and the Mediterranean.<ref name=Mason/>

===Transfer to RAN===
In 1933, it was decided to replace the five [[S class destroyer (1916)|S class destroyers]] (HMA Ships {{HMAS|Stalwart|H14|2}}, {{HMAS|Success|H02|2}}, {{HMAS|Swordsman||2}}, {{HMAS|Tasmania||2}}, and {{HMAS|Tattoo||2}}) and the flotilla leader ({{HMAS|Anzac|1917|6}}) on loan to the RAN with newer ships.<ref name=Cassells143/> ''Vampire'', along with three sister ships (the V class destroyer {{HMAS|Vendetta|D69|2}} and the W class destroyers {{HMAS|Voyager|D31|2}} and {{HMAS|Waterhen|D22|2}}) and the [[Scott class flotilla leader|''Scott'' class flotilla leader]] {{HMS|Stuart|D00|6}} were selected by the [[Admiralty]] for loan to Australia as a flotilla.<ref name=Cassells143/>

The five vessels were paid off from RN service at [[Portsmouth, England]] on 11 October 1933, and were commissioned into the RAN on the same day.<ref name=Cassells143/> Less than a week later, the ships left for Australia, arriving in Sydney on 21 December.<ref name=Cassells143/> ''Vampire'' was paid off into reserve on 31 January 1934, but was recommissioned for three days in mid-July to be sailed down to [[Flinders Naval Depot]] for use as a tender.<ref name=Cassells143/> The destroyer remained in "reserve commission" until 11 May 1938, when she was recommissioned for full service.<ref name=Cassells143/>

===World War II <U+2013> Mediterranean===
''Vampire'' operated in Australian waters until the start of World War II, and on 14 October 1939, joined her sister ships and ''Stuart'' (a force nicknamed the "[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]") as they were deployed to the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]].<ref name=Cassells143/> From her arrival until April 1940, ''Vampire'' was primarily assigned to convoy escort duties between Malta and Marseilles.<ref name=Cassells143/> The destroyer operated as an escort and anti-submarine patrol ship from the end of April, and escorted the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}} during the [[Battle of Calabria]] on 9 July.<ref name=Cassells143/> The only damage sustained by ''Vampire'' was the result of near misses and splinters caused by Italian aircraft bombing ''Eagle'': an RN torpedo gunner aboard the destroyer became the first fatality of the war aboard a RAN ship when he died three days later from splinter wounds.<ref name=Cassells143/>

[[File:HMAS Vampire (AWM 012563).jpg|thumb|left|HMAS ''Vampire'', circa 1940]]
After repairs in Alexandria, ''Vampire'' resumed escort and patrol duties, and on several occasions was unsuccessfully used in attempts to lure the Italian fleet to where they could be engaged by the Allies.<ref name=Cassells143/> In late October and early November, the early phases of the [[Battle of Greece]], the destroyer escorted convoys in Greek waters, before being deployed to aid the [[Western Desert Campaign]] as an escort.<ref name=Cassells143/> On 20 December, ''Vampire'' stripped her engines, forcing the destroyer to dock for repairs.<ref name=Cassells143/> These were completed on 8 January 1941, and ''Vampire'' was sent back to Greece, where she operated until May, aiding in the Allied reinforcement ([[Operation Lustre]]) and evacuation ([[Operation Demon]]).<ref name=Cassells144>Cassells, ''The Destroyers'', p. 144</ref> She was then deployed back to the Western Desert Campaign, operating as part of the "[[Tobruk Ferry Service]]"; ships transporting supplies and reinforcements to the Allied-controlled, [[Siege of Tobruk|besieged town of Tobruk]].<ref name=Cassells144/> However, after two trips, the destroyer had to be removed from service because further engine problems were causing the ship to vibrate excessively at speeds over {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}.<ref name=Cassells144/> The ship sailed to Singapore for major repairs, which lasted until late 1941.<ref name=Cassells144/>

===World War II <U+2013> British Eastern Fleet===
In December 1941, she joined to the [[British Eastern Fleet]] at [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]]. In the first week of December, the battlecruiser {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} started on a trip to Australia with ''Vampire'' and {{HMS|Tenedos|H04|6}} as escorts, but the force was recalled.<ref>Middlebrook & Mahoney, ''Battleship'', p. 102</ref> Early in the morning of 8 December (Singapore time), Singapore came under attack by Japanese aircraft. ''Repulse'' and the British battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}}, which were in the harbor at the time, shot back with anti-aircraft fire; no planes were shot down, and the ships sustained no damage. After receiving the reports of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and invasions of [[Siam]] by the Japanese, Force Z (consisting of ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'', escorted by ''Vampire'', {{HMS|Electra|H27|2}}, {{HMS|Express|H61|2}}, and ''Tenedos'') put to sea at 1730 hours on 8 December.<ref>Middlebrook & Mahoney, ''Battleship'', pp. 99<U+2013>113</ref>

At 20:55 hours, Admiral Philips cancelled the operation, and ordered the force to return to Singapore. On the way back, they were spotted and reported by [[Japanese submarine I-58]]. The next morning, 10 December, they received a report of Japanese landings at [[Kuantan]], and ''Express'' was sent to investigate the area, finding nothing. That afternoon, ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'' were [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|attacked and sunk]] by 85 Japanese aircraft off Kuantan aircraft from the [[22nd Air Flotilla]] based at [[Saigon]].<ref>Middlebrook & Mahoney, ''Battleship'', pp. 145<U+2013>267</ref> ''Vampire'' rescued 225 of the ships' 2,081 survivors from the sea, and transported them to Singapore.<ref name=Cassells144/>

On 26 January 1942, following reports that an unescorted group of Japanese troopships were sailing near [[Endau]], Malaya, ''Vampire'' and {{HMS|Thanet|H29|6}} were [[Battle off Endau|ordered to intercept]].<ref name=Cassells144/> Reaching the Japanese convoy at 0200 the next morning, the two destroyers found the troopships were protected by the cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Sendai|''Sendai'']] and six destroyers.<ref name=Cassells144/> The allied destroyers attempted to escape: ''Vampire'' was successful, but ''Thanet'' was sunk.<ref name=Cassells144/>

On 11 February, ''Vampire'' was attached to Eastern Fleet forces operating in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Cassells144/> At the start of April, ''Vampire'' was ordered to escort the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}} from Ceylon, as the Japanese presence in the area was likely to overpower the area.<ref name=Cassells144/>

==Loss==
[[File:HMS Hermes and HMAS Vampire under air attack 1942.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Hermes'' and HMAS ''Vampire'' under attack by Japanese aircraft]]
Following the Japanese Fast Carrier Task Force's [[Indian Ocean raid#Attack on Colombo, Ceylon|attack on Colombo]] in early April, ''Hermes'' and ''Vampire'' were ordered to depart Trincomalee to avoid a follow-up strike.<ref name=Cassells144/> Sailing on April 8, the two ships avoided the aerial bombing of the port early the next morning, but were spotted and attacked by Japanese carrier aircraft at 10:35.<ref name=Cassells144/>

''Hermes'' was lost within twenty minutes, and after the aircraft left, those aboard ''Vampire'' thought they had been spared.<ref name=Cassells144/> However, the aircraft had returned to the carriers to rearm, and on their return bombed the destroyer heavily.<ref name=Cassells144/> ''Vampire'' shot down at least one aircraft before breaking in half and sinking: her [[ensign]] the last to submerge.<ref name=Cassells144/> Despite the ferocity of the attack, ''Vampire''{{'}}s commanding officer and eight sailors were the only fatalities.<ref name=Cassells144/> The survivors from both ''Hermes'' and ''Vampire'' were recovered by the hospital ship ''Vita''.<ref name=Mason/>

''Vampire'' was awarded five battle honours for her wartime service: "Calabria 1940", "Libya 1940<U+2013>41", "Greece 1941", "Crete 1941", and "Indian Ocean 1941<U+2013>42".<ref name=newhonours>{{cite news |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |title=Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110613184920/http://www.navy.gov.au/Navy_Marks_109th_Birthday_With_Historic_Changes_To_Battle_Honours |archivedate=13 June 2011 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=honourslist>{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |title=Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours |date=1 March 2010 |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110614064156/http://www.navy.gov.au/w/images/Units_entitlement_list.pdf |archivedate=14 June 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>
