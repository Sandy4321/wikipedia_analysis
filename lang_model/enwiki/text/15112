'''Survivor Series (1994)''' was the eighth annual [[Survivor Series]] [[pay-per-view]] [[professional wrestling]] event produced by the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). It took place on [[Thanksgiving]] Eve, November 23, 1994 at the [[Freeman Coliseum]] in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]]. It was also the last Survivor Series to take place on the traditional Thanksgiving/Thanksgiving Eve date the show had always occupied since its inception; the [[Survivor Series (1995)|following Survivor Series]] and all subsequent shows have taken place on Sunday nights.

Two main event matches were held; in the first, [[Bob Backlund]] won the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] from [[Bret Hart]] in a [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]] match after Bret's brother [[Owen Hart|Owen]] convinced their mother to throw in a towel to end the match. In the other main event, [[The Undertaker]] defeated [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|casket match]].

The event also featured three [[Survivor Series#Survivor Series matches|elimination matches]] and two singles matches. [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]] led The Bad Guys against [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]'s team of The Teamsters. Ramon won the match for his team after all members of the other team were counted out. [[Doink the Clown]] teamed with three [[midget]]s to form Clowns R' Us in a match against The Royal Family, composed of [[Jerry Lawler]] and three midgets. The Royal Family won the match, but all seven other competitors attacked Lawler after the match. [[Lex Luger]] led Guts and Glory against the [[Million Dollar Corporation]] team, which was managed by [[Ted DiBiase]]. DiBiase's team won after Luger, the last wrestler from his team, was pinned.

[[Shawn Michaels]] and Diesel, the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champions]] going in to the event, began feuding after Michaels accidentally kicked Diesel during the match. They vacated their title and began a feud that led to a match at [[WrestleMania XI]]. Three days after Survivor Series, Diesel won the WWF Championship by defeating Backlund. The rivalry between Backlund and Bret Hart continued, and they also faced each other at WrestleMania XI.

==Background==
[[Image:Owen Hart.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Owen Hart]] was feuding with his brother-in-law [[Davey Boy Smith]] and his brother [[Bret Hart]] leading up the event.]]
Several storylines formed the background for the opening match, which saw the [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] team of The Bad Guys ([[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], the [[Sean Waltman|1-2-3 Kid]], [[Davey Boy Smith]] and [[The Headshrinkers]]) square off against the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] team of The Teamsters ([[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Owen Hart]] and [[Jim Neidhart]]). Razor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since September 1993 when Ramon won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]]. Michaels, the former champion, had been stripped of the belt. [[Professional wrestling authority figures#President|WWF President]] [[Jack Tunney]] scheduled a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], in which Ramon and [[Rick Martel]] were the final participants remaining. They faced each other on [[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]], and Ramon won the match and was awarded the title.<ref name=razor1/> Michaels claimed that he was the rightful holder of the belt and refused to acknowledge Ramon as the champion.<ref name=razor1>{{cite web|title=History of the Intercontinental Championship: Razor Ramon's first reign|work=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322472|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref><ref name=nash3233>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Ross|title=Kevin Nash|pages=32<U+2013>33|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0823934926}}</ref> Diesel was serving as Michaels' bodyguard but soon became an active wrestler and carried on Michaels' feud with Ramon.<ref name=nash33>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Ross|title=Kevin Nash|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0823934926|page=33}}</ref><ref name=nash37>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Ross|title=Kevin Nash|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0823934926|page=37}}</ref> In the months leading up to Survivor Series, Ramon had also developed a feud with Jeff Jarrett, and the two faced each other several times with the Intercontinental Championship on the line.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeff Jarrett|work=SLAM!

Although [[Jerry Lawler]] and [[Doink the Clown]] had a storyline rivalry that dated back to when Doink [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned]] on Lawler by dumping a bucket of water on him following [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam 1993]],<ref name=wwf93>{{cite web|title=Ring Results: 1993|work=The History of WWE|url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/93.htm|accessdate=2008-03-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216080431/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/93.htm |archivedate = February 16, 2008}}</ref> the feud had rarely been mentioned since then. On the September 10, 1994 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'', however, Lawler provoked Doink by popping balloons carried by Doink's [[midget]] sidekick [[Claude Giroux (wrestler)|Dink]].<ref name=toa112194>{{cite web|title=WWF Raw: November 21, 1994|work=The Other Arena|url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw112194 |accessdate=2008-03-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071215125729/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1994/raw112194 |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}</ref> The rivalry soon led to Lawler introducing a midget named Queasy, who dressed like Lawler.<ref name=toa112194/> Doink and Lawler then introduced several more midgets over the following weeks.<ref name=toa112194/> An elimination match was booked for Survivor Series, with Lawler, Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy facing Doink, Dink, Wink and Pink.<ref name=toa112194/>

[[Bret Hart]]'s [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Bob Backlund]] dated back to the July 30, 1994 episode of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling''. Backlund believed that he had won the match and the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund turned on him and performed the [[Professional wrestling holds#Crossface chickenwing|crossface chickenwing]] on Hart.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shields|first=Brian|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2006|isbn=1416532579|page=108}}</ref> Following the match, Backlund acted quite differently than he had when he portrayed a face. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]], Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to the [[Iron Sheik]]'s [[Professional wrestling holds#Camel clutch|camel clutch]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Pro Wrestling: From Carnivals to Cable TV|last=Greenberg|first=Keith Elliot|publisher=Lerner Publications|year=2000|isbn=0822533324|page=53}}</ref> A submission match was booked between Hart and Backlund for Survivor Series with the stipulation that the match could only end when a wrestler's [[cornerman]] threw a towel in to the ring. Hart's cornerman was his real-life brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith. Backlund's cornerman was Bret's brother Owen Hart, who had a long rivalry with Bret since turning on him during a [[tag team]] match at the 1994 Royal Rumble.<ref name=davies69>{{cite book|title=Bret Hart|last=Davies|first=Ross|isbn=0823934942|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2001|page=69}}</ref>

[[Image:LexLuger.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Lex Luger]] was feuding with the [[Million Dollar Corporation]] leading in to Survivor Series.]]
The central feud in the match between Guts & Glory and The Million Dollar Team was between [[Lex Luger]] and [[Ted DiBiase]]'s [[Million Dollar Corporation]]. During 1994, DiBiase had "purchased" the contracts of several wrestlers to form a heel [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Among the members to join were [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and [[King Kong Bundy]].<ref name=dibiase>{{cite web|title=Ted DiBiase|work=SLAM!

Bigelow attacked his opponent, a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]], before the match. DiBiase then claimed that the company was not providing suitable competition, and he challenged any wrestler to face Bigelow. Bomb responded, and the two brawled briefly.<ref name=wwf94/> Leading up to Survivor Series, Bomb and Bigelow faced each other at several [[house show]]s.<ref name=wwf94/> [[The Heavenly Bodies]] were not members of DiBiase's stable, but they competed on behalf of the group. At the time, they were involved in a feud with [[The Smokin' Gunns]] as a result of a match on the September 3 episode of ''Superstars of Wrestling''. The Heavenly Bodies attacked the Gunns prior to the match and stole the Gunns' cowboy hats. They put on the hats to mock the Gunns and then threw them on the ground and stomped on them. To get revenge, the Gunns stole The Heavenly Bodies' ring robes and tore the wings off them.<ref name=wwf94/>

The feud between [[The Undertaker]] and [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] began at [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series 1993]]. During an elimination match, Yokozuna was unable to injure The Undertaker, despite slamming The Undertaker's head into the ring steps and performing the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Seated senton|Banzai drop]] on him.<ref name=toass93>{{cite web| title=Survivor Series '93|work=The Other Arena|url=http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1993/wwf112493 | accessdate=2008-05-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20030610140745/http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1993/wwf112493 |archivedate = 2003-06-10}}</ref> A match was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] for [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble 1994]], in which The Undertaker would challenge WWF Champion Yokozuna for the title in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Casket match]]. During the match, which featured a no-[[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] clause, [[Mr. Fuji]], Yokozuna's manager, hired nine other wrestlers to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf. Yokozuna won the match after opening The Undertaker's [[urn]], which, according to the storyline, contained the secret to The Undertaker's powers. After the match, The Undertaker appeared on the video screen and vowed to return to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] one day.<ref name=under>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|publisher=ECW Press|last=Baer|first=Randy|coauthors=R.D.

The first match of the event saw The Bad Guys, which consisted of [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], the [[Sean Waltman|1-2-3 Kid]], the [[Davey Boy Smith]], and [[The Headshrinkers]] ([[Sione Vailahi|Sionne]] and [[Solofa Fatu|Fatu]]) versus The Teamsters, composed of [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Owen Hart]], and [[Jim Neidhart]].

The match between [[Jerry Lawler]]'s team, known as The Royal Family (with Queasy, Sleazy, and Cheesy), and [[Doink the Clown|Doink]]'s Clowns R' Us team (with Dink, Wink, and Pink) consisted of comedic action for much of the first ten minutes.<ref name=oww>{{cite web|title=Survivor Series: November 23, 1994|work=Online World of Wrestling|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/survivorseries94.html|accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref> Eventually, Doink attempted a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving crossbody|crossbody]], but Lawler reversed the move.<ref name=oo>{{cite web|last=Gutschmidt|first=Adam|title=Survivor Series 1994 Re-Revued|work=Online Onslaught|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20040812.shtml|accessdate=2008-03-08}}</ref> He was able to pin Doink and eliminate him from the match.<ref name=oww/> Lawler remained involved in the match and played a role in the elimination of two more members of Doink's team.

Dink performed a crossbody on Sleazy and attempted to pin him.<ref name=wwf94/> Queasy rolled the wrestlers over so that Sleazy was on top, however, and the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] made the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Three count|three count]] and awarded the match to The Royal Family.<ref name=wwf94/><ref name=hoff/> As Queasy, Sleazy and Cheesy celebrated after the match, Lawler criticized them for taking credit for the victory.<ref name=oww/> All six midgets turned against Lawler and chased him away from the ring.<ref name=hoff/> As Lawler tried to escape, Doink returned and hit him in the face with a pie.<ref name=oo/>

The next match was the [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]] match between champion [[Bret Hart]] and challenger [[Bob Backlund]].

The team of Guts and Glory, consisting of [[Lex Luger]], [[Bryan Clark|Adam Bomb]], [[Nelson Frazier, Jr.|Mabel]], and [[The Smoking Gunns]] ([[Monty Sopp|Billy]] and [[Mike Polchlopek|Bart Gunn]]), faced The Million Dollar Team, made up of [[Chris Chavis|Tatanka]], [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], [[King Kong Bundy]], and [[The Heavenly Bodies]] ([[Tom Prichard]] and [[Jimmy Del Ray]]) in the next match.

Diesel and [[Shawn Michaels]] began a feud as a result of the events at Survivor Series. After Michaels won a WWF Championship match at WrestleMania XI by winning the [[Royal Rumble (1995)|1995 Royal Rumble]] match, he faced his former bodyguard for the title.<ref name=m42>{{cite book|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the World's Greatest Professional Wrestlers|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2004|isbn=1582618178|page=42}}</ref> Diesel won the match after [[Sid Eudy|Sid]], Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Ross|title=Kevin Nash|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0823934926|page=48}}</ref> Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his services would not be required during the rematch.

[[Lex Luger]]'s feud with the [[Million Dollar Corporation]] did not continue, as the Corporation targeted [[The Undertaker]].
