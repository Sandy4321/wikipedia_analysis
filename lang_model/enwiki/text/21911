'''James Ussher''' (sometimes spelled '''Usher''') ([[4 January]], [[1581]]&ndash;[[21 March]], [[1656]]) was [[Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland) | Archbishop of Armagh]] and [[Primate of All Ireland]] between 1625<U+2013>1656. He was a prolific scholar, who most famously published a [[Ussher chronology|chronology]] that purported to time and date [[Creation (theology)|Creation]] to the night preceding [[October 23]], [[4004 BC]].

==Education==
Ussher was born in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], into a well-to-do [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] family of Norman descent. His grandfather, James Stanihurst, had been speaker of the Irish parliament, and his father was a clerk in chancery. Ussher's younger, and only surviving, brother, Ambrose, became a distinguished scholar of [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]].  According to his chaplain and biographer, [[Nicholas Bernard]], the elder brother was taught to read by two blind, spinster aunts.  

Ussher was a gifted [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], entering Dublin Free School and then the newly-founded (1591) [[Trinity College, Dublin]] on 9 January, 1594, at the age of thirteen (not an unusual age at the time). He had received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree by 1598, and was a fellow and MA by 1600 (though Bernard claims he did not gain his MA till 1601). In May of 1602, he was ordained in the Trinity College Chapel as a deacon in the [[Protestant]], [[state religion|established]], [[Church of Ireland]] (and possibly priest on the same day) by his uncle Henry Ussher, the Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.  

Ussher went on to become [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]] of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]] in 1605 and Prebend of [[Finglas]].  He became Professor of Theological Controversies at Trinity College and a Bachelor of Divinity in 1607, Doctor of Divinity in 1612, and then [[Vice-Chancellor]] in 1615 and vice-provost in 1616. In 1613, he married Phoebe, daughter of a previous [[Vice-Provost]], [[Luke Challoner]], and published his first work.  In 1615, he was closely involved with the drawing up of the first [[confession of faith]] of the Church of Ireland.

==Early career==
In 1619, Ussher travelled to England, where he remained for two years.  His only child, [[Elizabeth Tyrrell (nee Ussher)|Elizabeth]], was born in London in 1619.  He became prominent after meeting [[James I of England|James I]].  In 1621, James nominated him [[Bishop of Meath]].  He also became a national figure in Ireland, becoming [[Privy Councillor]] in 1623 and an increasingly substantial scholar.  From 1623 until 1626, he was again in England and was excused from his episcopal duties in order to study church history. He was nominated [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of All Ireland and [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] in 1625 and succeeded his uncle.

==Primate of All Ireland==
[[Image:Jacobus_ussher.gif|thumbnail|left|Archbishop James Ussher (1581-1656)]]
After his consecration in 1626,  Ussher found himself in turbulent political times.  Tension was rising between England and Spain, and  to secure Ireland [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] offered Irish Catholics a series of concessions, including religious toleration, known as the Graces, in exchange for money for the upkeep of the army.  Ussher was a convinced [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and viewed with dismay the possibility that people he regarded as anti-Christian papists might achieve any sort of power. He called a secret meeting of the Irish bishops in his house in November of 1626, the result being the "Judgement of the Arch-Bishops and Bishops of Ireland".  This begins:

<blockquote><blockquote>The religion of the papists is superstitious and idolatrous; their faith and doctrine erroneous and heretical; their church in respect of both, apostatical; to give them therefore a toleration, or to consent that they may freely exercise their religion, and profess their faith and doctrine, is a grievous sin.</blockquote></blockquote>

The Judgement was not published until it was read out at the end of a series of sermons against the Graces given at Dublin in April 1627.  In the end, the Graces were not confirmed by the Irish parliament.  

During a four-year interregnum between Lord Deputies from 1629 on, there was an increase in efforts to impose religious conformity on Ireland.  In 1633, Ussher wrote to the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[William Laud]], in an effort to gain support for the imposition of recusancy fines on Irish Catholics.  [[Thomas Wentworth]], who arrived as the new Lord Deputy in Ireland in 1633, deflected the pressure for conformity by stating that firstly, the Church of Ireland itself would have to be properly resourced, and he set about its re-endowment.  He also settled the long-running primacy dispute between the sees of [[Armagh]] and [[Dublin]] in Armagh's favour.  

Ussher soon found himself at odds with the rise of [[Arminianism]] and Wentworth and Laud's desire for conformity between the [[Church of England]] and the more Calvinistic Church of Ireland.  Ussher resisted this pressure at a [[convocation]] in 1634, ensuring that the English [[Thirty-Nine Articles|Articles of Religion]] were adopted as well as the Irish articles, not instead of them, and that the Irish [[Canon law|canons]] had to be redrafted based on the English ones rather than replaced by them.  

In 1634, Ussher lost a battle to block the appointment of an Arminian as provost of Trinity College; by 1635, it was apparent that Ussher had lost ''de facto'' control of the church to [[John Bramhall]], Bishop of [[Derry]], in everyday matters, and to Laud in matters of policy.  

The traditional view of Ussher is of a slightly-unworldly scholar, who was, at best, a mediocre politician and administrator:  in fact he was an effective bishop and archbishop, and politically important;<ref>Abbott, W. M. (1990). "James Ussher and "Ussherian" episcopacy, 1640<U+2013>1656: the primate and his Reduction manuscript." ''Albion'' xxii: 237-59.</ref> however, he was reactive and sought conciliation rather than confrontation.<ref>''James Ussher'', [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (2004)]]</ref>  The story that he successfully opposed attempts to reintroduce the [[Irish language]] for use in church services by [[William Bedell]], the Bishop of [[Kilmore]], has been refuted <ref>O'Sullivan, W. S. (1968). "Review of R.B.Knox, James Ussher Archbishop of Armagh." ''Irish Historical Studies'' xvi: 215<U+2013>19.</ref><ref>Leerssen, J. (1982<U+2013>3). "Archbishop Ussher and Gaelic culture." ''Studia Hibernica'' xxii<U+2013>xxiii: 50<U+2013>58.</ref>.  

Ussher certainly preferred to be a scholar when he could be.  He engaged in extensive disputations with Roman Catholic theologians, and even as a student he challenged a [[Jesuit]] relative, Henry Fitzsimon (Ussher's mother was Roman Catholic), to dispute publicly the identification of the [[Pope]] with the [[Antichrist]].  However, Ussher also wrote extensively on theology and ecclesiastical history, and these subjects gradually displaced his anti-Catholic work.  As well as by his learning, he was also distinguished by his charity and good temper.

Ussher left Dublin for his episcopal residence at [[Drogheda]], where he concentrated on his archdiocese and his research.  In 1631, he published a ''Discourse on the Religion Anciently Professed by the Irish'', a ground-breaking study of the early Irish church, which sought to demonstrate how it differed from Rome and was, instead, much closer to the later Protestant church.  In 1639, he published the most substantial history of Christianity in Britain to that date, ''Britannicarum ecclesiarum antiquitates''.  This account of the early Celtic church in Britain and Ireland was respected into the Twentieth Century.

==English Civil War==
In 1640, Ussher left Ireland for England for what turned out to be the last time.  In the years before the [[English Civil War]], his reputation as a scholar and his moderate Calvinism meant that his opinion was sought by both King and Parliament.  After Ussher lost his home and income through the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|Irish uprising]] of 1641, Parliament voted him a pension of <U+00A3>400 while the King awarded him the income and property of the vacant [[See of Carlisle]].  Despite his Calvinism, Ussher was a royalist, who supported the King and Wentworth (now Earl of Strafford) in the events leading up to the latter's execution, and a defender of the episcopacy.  In the face of attacks on the institution of bishops by [[Puritans]], he wrote or edited five books to demonstrate their existence since the earliest days of the church.  The last two, treatises on the [[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatian]] epistles were particular scholarly achievements that have largely survived modern scrutiny.  

During the Civil War, Ussher committed himself to the King and remained loyal, turning down an invitation to join the [[Westminster Assembly]] in 1643.  He moved to [[Oxford]], [[Bristol]], [[Cardiff]], and then to [[St Donat's Castle|St Donat's]].  In June of 1646, he returned to London under the protection of his friend, the Countess of [[Peterborough]], in whose houses he stayed from then on. He became a preacher at [[Lincoln's Inn]] early in 1647, and despite his royalist loyalties was protected by his friends in Parliament.  He watched the execution of Charles I from the roof of the Countess of Peterborough's London house but fainted before the axe fell.

==Ussher's Chronology==
{{main|Ussher chronology}}
Ussher now concentrated on his research and writing and returned to the study of chronology and the [[church fathers]]. After a 1647 work on the origin of the [[Creed]]s, Ussher published a treatise on the calendar in 1648.  This was a warm-up for his most famous work, the ''[[Annales veteris testamenti, a prima mundi origine deducti]]'' ("Annals of the Old Testament, deduced from the first origins of the world"), which appeared in 1650, and its continuation, ''[[Annalium pars postierior]]'', published in 1654. In this work, he calculated the date of the [[Creation]] to have been nightfall preceding [[23 October]], [[4004 BC]]. (Other scholars, such as [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] academic, [[John Lightfoot]], calculated their own dates for the Creation.) The time of the [[Ussher chronology]] is frequently misquoted as being 9 a.m., noon or 9 p.m. on 23 October. See the related article on the chronology for a discussion of its claims and methodology.

Ussher's work is sometimes, and often mockingly, associated with [[Young Earth Creationism]], which holds that the universe was created several millennia ago.  But while calculating the date of the Creation may seem an eccentric activity today, given the knowledge produced by modern [[geology]] and [[palaeontology]] and the fact that the Earth is now being dated by the scientific community at about 4.6 billion years old -- with the universe nine billion years older than that <U+2014> in Ussher's time such a calculation was still regarded as an important task, one previously attempted by many [[Renaissance]] scholars, such as [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]]. 

Ussher's chronology actually represented a considerable feat of literary scholarship if not science. It required the Bible to be firmly anchored in history, which demanded great depth of learning in what was then known of ancient history, including the rise of the Persians, Greeks and Romans. Constructing a biblical chronology also required expertise in biblical languages and in-depth knowledge of the [[Bible]] itself. Ussher's account of historical events for which he had multiple sources other than the Bible is usually in close agreement with modern accounts; for example, he placed the death of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] in 323 BC and that of [[Julius Caesar]] in 44 BC. On the other hand, the period of time between the [[Creation (theology)|Creation]] and the [[Noah|Flood]] depended on the version of the [[Old Testament]] that was used: [[Tanakh|Hebrew]] (1656 years); [[Samaritan]] [[Pentateuch]] (1307 years); or the [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] text (2262 years).  Ussher favoured the Hebrew version.  

''Annals'' has recently been republished in modern English.

==Death==
In 1655, Ussher published his last book, ''De Graeca Septuaginta Interpretum Versione'', the first serious examination of the [[Septuagint]], discussing its accuracy as compared with the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.  In 1656, he went to stay in the Countess of Peterborough's house in [[Reigate]], [[Surrey]].  On [[19 March]], he felt a sharp pain in his side after supper and took to his bed.  He died at one o'clock on [[21 March]] at the age of 75.  His last words were reported as ''O Lord forgive me, especially my sins of omission''.  His body was embalmed and was to have been buried in Reigate, but at [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell's]] insistence he was given a state funeral on [[17 April]] and buried in the chapel of St Erasmus in [[Westminster Abbey]].
