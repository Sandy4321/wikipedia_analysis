'''Alexander Geringas''' (* [[March 2]] [[1971]] in [[Moskow]]) is a [[music producer]], [[songwriter]], [[composer]] and [[lyricist]] based in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]].

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Alex Geringas was born in Moscow. His parents pianist Tatiana and cellist [[David Geringas]] left the [[Soviet Union]] in 1975. The Family first found refuge with relatives in [[New York]], then moved to [[Italy]] and after a short stay in [[Berlin]] settled in [[Hamburg]], which became the home base for his father's international career. After high school, Alex studied acting at the renown Otto-Falkenberg-School in Munich before graduating from the Hamburg School for Music and Theater.
While Alex quickly started his career as an actor in Theater, Film and Television, he was always was drawn to music. Having formed bands as early as his school years, he was looking for a way to combine his passions and talents. He ultimately found this way by not only performing in but writing, composing, producing  musical theater. His obvious talent as a lyricist quickly caught the attention of the pop music scene and jump started his subsequent success as a spearhead in the early years of German language rap and earned him his first number one hits, golden records.
Since then Alex has continued to expand his work as lyricist and composer and soon became one of Germany's most successful pop music producers starting and promoting the careers of many artist and involved in a broad palette of projects including film and television with partners and collaborators all over the world. While his work makes him chase from city to city and town to town, Alex continues to have his base in his home town of [[Hamburg]], where he not only owns and runs Lexland Studios but more importantly finds his inspiration and strong backing in his wife actress Katharina Mittermeier and their two young daughters.

=== Career in Theater and Film ===
Fresh out of acting school, Alex worked in stage productions at the Theater Lubeck and joined the ensemble cast of the Volktheater Rostock. But even during this time he sought to expand his horizons. Forming the comedy act "Peter Alexander Show" with fellow actor Peter Jordan proved to be a surprise success and quickly attracted offers for their own television program. But Alex never wanted to be pigeon holed, he turned down the offers and instead continued to develop his craft and his projects. When he was cast by the Hamburger Kammerspiele to star alongside renown theater stars [[Ulrich Tukur]], [[Gerd Wameling]] and [[Peter Fitz]], he quickly convinced the Theater to produce his musical "The Red Corsar" (1996) that proved to be a breakout success and was followed up with three other productions "The Secret of the Red Hand" (1998), "The red Kings Game" (2000) and "The Red String" (2002), co-written with Marc Letzig. During this period he continued to perform with his comedy act and in many stage plays and event, both musical as well as dramatical in many venues including the Thalia Theater, the Ernst Deutsch Theater and the national festival at the Ruhrfestpiele and wrote the music for a number of stage productions as well as films and television. The Hamburger Kammerspiele continued to produce his commercially successful and critically acclaimed productions of "Grandios Loosers" and it's follow-up "Grandios Christmas" both of which he also directed and co-wrote with Peter Jordan.
As an actor, alex also starred in numerous films and television series, most notably in the [[Costa Gavras]] film "[[Amen. (film)]]" alongside [[Ulrich Tukur]] ([[Solaris]]) and [[Ulrich M<U+00FC>he]] ([[The Lives of Others]]).

== Music and Lyrics ==
Alex claims "I only started to write lyrics because nobody else wanted the job"{{Fact|date=February 2009}}.While this is clearly and understatement, his talent with words quickly made him a trailblazer for German language rap. His work with the act "Die Dritte Generation" not only brought him his first number one hit, two more top ten songs and several golden records but also gave him the opportunity to follow his passion for hooky melodies, string arrangements (clearly influence by his upbringing in classical music) and first and foremost his love for fat beats. Having written all of three records with the band, he became one of the head writers for the "popstars"- winner girl Act  "No Angels" and spread out to many more including "Bro'Sis" and Christina St<U+00FC>rmer all of which resulted in number one or top ten singles. He started to expand his responsibilities, realizing that all of his talents could best be applied as a topliner , arranger and producer. He started developing new artists and producing tracks for many major acts and labels and co-writing with the likes of [[Winston Sela]], [[Charlie Mason]], [[Peter-John Vettese]] and [[Amy Powers]]. In 2008 he was music director of the TV show ''Popstars - Just for Girls'', a German version of [[American Idol]].
