'''Caterina Benedicta Grazianini''' (''fl.'' early-18th century) was an Italian composer of oratorios in [[Vienna]]. She was among the female composers of oratorios in Vienna who, according to Wellesz, were regular [[canonesses]], rather than employed at the court. This group included [[Maria de Raschenau]], [[Maria Margherita Grimani]], and [[Camilla de Rossi]].<ref>Raschenau</ref> Grazianini is known only through her two surviving works, the [[oratorio]]s ''S Gemignano vescovo e protettore di Modena'' (performed 1705 and 1715) and ''S Teresa''. On one of these is a note to the effect that it was performed for the ladies of [[Modena]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], and was very well received.<ref>Jackson</ref> Her works are in two sections and an Italian overture, for four soloists and string orchestra.<ref>Grazianini</ref>
