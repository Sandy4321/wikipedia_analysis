'''Deddington Castle''' was a [[Castle|medieval fortification]] in the village of [[Deddington]], [[Oxfordshire]]. It was built on a wealthy former [[Anglo-Saxon]] estate by Bishop [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Odo of Bayeux]] following the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066. Odo constructed a large castle with two earthwork [[Bailey (fortification)|bailey]]s and a central [[motte]], intending that the castle administer his property in the region and provide a substantial military base in the event of an Anglo-Saxon revolt. Odo's estates in England were seized following a failed rebellion against [[William II of England|William II]] in 1088, and Deddington Castle was taken back into royal control. The Anglo-Norman lord [[William de Chesney]] acquired the castle in the 12th century and rebuilt it in stone, raising a stone [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] around a new inner bailey, complete with a defensive tower, [[gatehouse]] and domestic buildings.

After de Chesney's death, his descendants fought for control of the castle in the royal courts, and it was temporarily seized several times by King [[John of England|John]] at the start of the 13th century. Deddington Castle was confirmed in the ownership of the de Dive family, who held it for the next century and a half. In 1281, the castle was stormed by a group of men who broke down the doors, and in 1312 the [[royal favourite]] [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]] may have been captured at the castle by his enemies, shortly before his execution. From the 13th century onward, Deddington Castle fell into disrepair, and contemporaries soon described it as "demolished" and "weak". It was bought by the [[Canons of Windsor]] in 1364, who began to sell off its stonework. The remains of the castle were reportedly used by both [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces during the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century.

In the 19th century Deddington Castle was adapted for use as a sporting facility by the local [[gentry]]. It was sold to Deddington's [[Parish councils in England|parish council]], who attempted to build tennis courts in the inner bailey in 1947. Following the discovery of medieval remains and a subsequent [[Archaeology|archaeological investigation]], these plans were abandoned and the western half of the castle became a local park. In the 21st century, [[English Heritage]] manage the inner bailey, the eastern half remaining in use for farming, and the site as a whole is protected under UK law as a [[scheduled monument]].

==History==

===11th century===
Deddington Castle was built by Bishop [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Odo of Bayeux]] in the village of Deddington, shortly after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066.<ref name="Ivens 1983 35">{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=35}}</ref> Deddington was then one of the largest settlements in the county of Oxfordshire, and the site of the castle had been previously occupied by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], who may have used the location to administer one of their landed estates.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=61}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}</ref> Odo was the half-brother of [[William the Conqueror]], who granted the bishop vast lands in England after the invasion, spread across 22 different counties.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=101}}</ref> Deddington was one of the richest of Odo's new [[manor]]s and was at the centre of his Oxfordshire and [[Buckinghamshire]] estates.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=108}}</ref> The castle was probably built to act as the ''[[caput]]'', or administrative centre, of his lands in the region, and may have also been intended to quarter a large military force in the event of an Anglo-Saxon revolt.<ref name="Ivens 1984 113<U+2013>114">{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|pp=113<U+2013>114}}; {{harvnb|Creighton|2005|p=37}}</ref>

The castle was positioned on the east side of the main part of the settlement at the time, at the opposite end of the village to the church, on a spur overlooking a nearby stream.<ref name=BritHisListing>{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1014749 | title=List Entry Summary: Deddington Castle | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> Odo erected earthworks to enclose two large [[Bailey (fortification)|bailey]]s of around {{convert|3.4|hectare}} each, with a large raised [[motte]] positioned in between.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|pp=111, 113}}; {{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1014749 | title=List Entry Summary: Deddington Castle | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> The western bailey was around {{convert|170|m}} by {{convert|240|m}}, protected by a bank of earth {{convert|5|m}} tall from the base of the {{convert|15|m}} wide ditch.<ref name=Listing>{{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1014749 | title=List Entry Summary: Deddington Castle | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=English Heritage}}</ref> The top of the earthworks formed a rampart {{convert|2.5|m}} across.<ref name=Listing/> The western bailey had an entrance on the west side and in the north-east corner.<ref name=Listing/> The eastern bailey stretched down the hill to the stream, and may have held two fishponds.<ref name=Listing/> Another fishpond called "the Fishers", further along the stream to the south-east of the castle, was also probably linked to the castle site.<ref name=BritHisListing/> Around this time, an "L"-shaped stone hall was constructed near the motte, in the western bailey.<ref name=Ivens1984P111>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=111}}</ref>

The castle's layout was unusual for the region during this period, where the fortifications built by the Normans were typically smaller [[ringwork]] designs, and it highlighted both the strategic importance of the location and the power of its builder.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|pp=113<U+2013>114}}</ref> In scale and design it was similar to the initial version of [[Rochester Castle]], another major fortification built by Odo in England.<ref name="Ivens 1984 113<U+2013>114"/>

Odo unsuccessfully rebelled against [[William II of England|William II]] in 1088 and in the aftermath was stripped of his lands.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=114}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1994|p=61}}</ref> His manors across Oxfordshire were taken back into royal control and broken up to be granted to sub-tenants, although it is unclear who was initially granted Deddington Castle; it is possible that the powerful Anglo-Norman baron [[Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], the [[Earl of Leicester]], controlled it in 1130.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|pp=114<U+2013>115}}</ref>

In the early 12th century, additional earthworks were thrown up to divide the western half of the castle into an outer bailey of around {{convert|3|hectare}} and an inner bailey on the east end, comprising around {{convert|0.4|hectare}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=111}}</ref> The earthworks pushed up against the older hall, and partially buried its western walls.<ref name=Ivens1984P111/> It is uncertain exactly why the new earthworks were constructed, but it may have been to strengthen the fortification in response to either the threatened invasion of Duke [[Robert Curthose|Robert of Normandy]] in 1101, or alternatively to the sinking of the ''[[White Ship]]'' and the subsequent dynastic crisis in 1120.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|pp=112<U+2013>115}}</ref>

By 1157, the castle was owned by [[William de Chesney]], an Anglo-Norman lord who had supported King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] in the region during the civil war of [[the Anarchy]], and then [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] after the peace in 1154.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=112}}</ref> William rebuilt much of the castle, constructing a strong stone [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] around the inner bailey, {{convert|2|m}} thick and made from mortared [[ironstone]] rubble.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=37}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=111}}</ref> The wall was cut through the motte, the inner part of the mound being dug away to make room for the wall.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=37}}</ref>

William also began to reconstruct the inside of the inner bailey, a programme of work that was continued by his descendants over the next few decades.<ref name=Ivens1984P111/> The work included a chapel, a hall and [[Solar (room)|solar]], and various service buildings.<ref name=Ivens1984P111/> An open-backed square tower was built in stone along the wall on top of the motte; this tower was later rebuilt, possibly because of pressure on it from the motte earthworks, and the top of the motte was relaid with flagstones to form pathways around the top.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|pp=37<U+2013>39}}</ref> A stone [[gatehouse]] was built on the west side of the wall, leading from the outer bailey.<ref name=Ivens1984P111/>

William died between 1172 and 1176, and the castle was then granted the Crown to Ralph Murdac, William's nephew and a favoured supporter of Henry II.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=115}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}</ref> Ralph was unpopular, however, with Henry's successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], and Ralph's relatives Guy de Dive and Matilda de Chesney took the opportunity to sue him in the royal courts, each claiming a third of William's estate.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=115}}</ref> The lands around the castle were granted to Guy and, renamed the "Castle Manor", remained in his family line until the mid-14th century.<ref name="british-history.ac.uk">{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=117}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}</ref> When King [[John of England|John]] took the throne, however, he seems to have seized Deddington.

Both the village and the castle of Deddington fell into decline during the 13th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=117}}</ref> Although the village had grown to become a [[borough]], with new, planned streets spreading westwards away from the castle, it was eclipsed economically by the nearby, newer centre of [[Banbury]].<ref name=BritHistory/> The castles in the Thames Valley region that lacked substantial defences were mostly abandoned during this period and Deddington Castle was no exception.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|2006|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=117}}</ref> By 1277 contemporaries described it as "an old demolished castle".<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|2006|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=117}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}</ref> In 1281, Robert of Aston and a group of men were able to break down the doors to the castle and enter it.<ref name=BritHistory/> The castle was considered to be "weak" in a report of 1310 and no further repairs were carried out on the property after this time.<ref name=BritHistory/>

In 1312, the [[royal favourite]] [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]], may have been captured at Deddington Castle.<ref name=BritHistPettifer/> Gaveston was a close friend of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] but he had many enemies among the major barons, and had surrendered to them on the promise that he would be unharmed.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=74<U+2013>75}}</ref> He was taken south by [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer de Valence]], the [[Earl of Pembroke]], who imprisoned Gaveston at Deddington on 9 June while he left to visit his wife.<ref name=BritHistory/> Gaveston is often stated to have been kept in Deddington Castle, although he may have alternatively been lodged in the rectory house in the village.<ref name=BritHistPettifer>{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}; {{harvnb|Pettifer|2002|p=204}}</ref> [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Guy de Beauchamp]], the [[Earl of Warwick]], had a particular dislike of Gaveston and the next morning took the opportunity to seize him and take him back to [[Warwick Castle]], where Gaveston was subsequently tried and killed by his enemies.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=75<U+2013>76}}</ref>

During the 14th century the interior of the castle continued to be inhabited, but in a manner that archaeologist Richard Ivens likens to "squatting": the upper levels of the tower were abandoned and wood burnt along the inside of the walls in a crude fireplace.<ref name=Ivens1983P39>{{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=39}}</ref> In 1364, the [[Canons of Windsor]] bought the castle, park and former fishponds from Thomas de Dive; the Canons rented the farmlands out, but retained the right to operate and profit from the castle's [[manorial court]].<ref name="british-history.ac.uk"/> The tower was demolished around this time, possibly linked to the sale of stonework from the castle walls in 1377 to the [[Canons of Bicester]].<ref name=Ivens1983P39/> By the 16th century, the visiting antiquarian John Leland only noted that "there hath bene a castle at Dadintone".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=118}}</ref>

The village of Deddington was extensively involved in the [[English Civil War]] between 1641 and 1645, owing to its location on the route between Banbury and Oxford.<ref name=BritHistory/> The late 19th-century historian James Mackenzie recorded that the castle was used as a temporary fortress by both [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] forces during the conflict and that a Royalist garrison was besieged there by Parliamentary troops in 1644.<ref>{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1896|p=155}}</ref> During the 17th and 18th centuries, the castle site was used for grazing animals and timber farming.<ref name=BritHistory/>

In the 19th century, the castle site was used as club by the local [[gentry]] for recreation, including cricket and archery.<ref name=BritHistory/> A small lodge was built at the entrance to house a [[Coach (sport)|professional coach]], and a "pavilion building" - a combination of a [[ballroom]] and a [[cafe]] - was built within the grounds.<ref name=BritHistory/> In 1886, the ownership of the site passed from the Canons of Windsor to the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=BritHistory/> The pavilion was demolished at the start of the 20th century.<ref name=BritHistory/> Stonework continued to be taken from the remains of the castle up until the 1940s, for use in local buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Ivens|1984|p=112}}</ref>

The castle site was then sold by the Commissioners to Deddington's [[Parish councils in England|parish council]].<ref name=BritHistory/> The parish council intended to build tennis courts in the inner bailey of the castle in 1947 but, when work began, medieval pottery and roof tiles began to be unearthed by the builders.<ref>{{harvnb|Jope|Threlfall|1946<U+2013>47|p=167}}</ref> Construction work was halted and the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]] sponsored an [[Archaeology|archaeological investigation]] by Edward Jope and Richard Threlfall that continued until 1953.<ref>{{harvnb|Jope|Threlfall|1946<U+2013>47|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Ivens|1983|p=35}}</ref> The plans for the tennis courts were dropped in light of the findings, and the site was instead used as a park.<ref>{{harvnb|Jope|Threlfall|1946<U+2013>47|p=167}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101855 | title=Parishes: Deddington', A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 11: Wootton Hundred (Northern Part) (1983), pp. 81<U+2013>120 | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=15 December 2013 |publisher=Victoria County History}}</ref> A further phase of archaeological investigation of the castle was carried out between 1977 and 1979, sponsored by the [[Queen's University Belfast]] and led by Richard Ivens.<ref name="Ivens 1983 35"/>
