'''Botulism''' ([[Latin]], ''botulinus'', "sausage") (pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|b|<U+0252>|t<U+0283>|<U+0289>||l|I|z|<U+0259>m|}})  is, in humans, a rare and sometimes fatal [[paralytic]] illness. ''Foodborne botulism'' is an intoxication caused by consuming food contaminated with the [[botulinum toxin]]; it is not passed on from person to person  when the skin is intact. ''Infant botulism'' is a toxico-infection where the gastro-intestinal tract is colonized by spores prior to the  protective intestinal bacterial flora having developed and ''wound botulism'' is found most often among substance abusers when spores enter a wound under the skin, and, in the absence of oxygen are activated and release toxin.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/delibepidemics/botulismqa.pdf It is important to distinguish between  infection and intoxication.  In most cases, botulism results from ingestion of the toxin  (intoxication).  In other cases (e.g. infant botulism, wound botulism), the disease results  from the ingestion of spores or infection of an open wound with spores which then  germinate and produce the bacterial cells that release the toxin. ''Questions and Answers on Botulism''  ([[WHO]]])</ref>

==General Information==

The toxin is a protein produced under anaerobic conditions (where there is no oxygen) by the bacterium ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', and affects a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds and fish.<ref name="whodestroy">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs270/en/</ref> In domestic fowl, such as ducks, chickens, etc. as well as in birds in the wild, the disease is known as ''Limberneck''.<ref>[http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/poultry/botulism_limberneck_western_duck_sickness/overview_of_botulism_in_poultry.html Merck Manual of Veterinary Medicine]</ref>

''Clostridium botulinum'' is a large anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus that forms subterminal [[endospores]].<ref name="ic.ucsc.edu">[http://ic.ucsc.edu/~flegal/etox80e/SpecTopics/botulism.html University of California, Santa Cruz Environmental toxicology <U+2013> Botulism]</ref>

There are seven serological  varieties of the bacterium denoted by the letters A to G. The toxin from all of these acts in the same way and producing similar symptoms: acetylcholine is prevented from being released from the motor nerve endings causing flaccid paralysis and symptoms of blurred vision, ptosis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or constipation, cramps, respiratory difficulty.

Botulinum toxin is broken into 8 neurotoxins (labeled as types A, B, C [C1, C2], D, E, F, G & H), which are [[antigenic variation|antigenically]] and [[serological]]ly distinct but structurally similar. Human botulism is caused mainly by types A, B, E, and (rarely) F. Types C and D cause toxicity only in other animals.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/325451-overview Divakara Kedlaya, MBBS ''Botulinum Toxin''  medscape]</ref>

In October of 2013, scientists released the discovery of type H; the eighth botulism neurotoxin found for the first time in forty years. However, further information about type H has been disclosed because of its potential lethality, lack of a known antitoxin and fear of abuse as a bioweapon.
<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/17/worlds-deadliest-substance-botulinum-toxin-video_n_4108396.html#slide=246116</ref> 

Some types produce a characteristic putrefactive smell and digest meat (types A and some of B and F); these are said to be [[proteolytic]]; type E and some types of B, C, D and F are nonproteolytic and can go undetected because there is no strong odour associated with them<ref name="ic.ucsc.edu"/>

When the bacteria are under stress, they develop spores, which are inert. Their natural habitats are in the soil,  in the silt that comprises the  bottom sediment of streams, lakes and coastal waters and in the ocean, while some types are  natural inhabitants of mammalian (e.g., human, cattle, horses) intestinal tracts, and are present in their excreta. The spores can survive in their inert form for many years.<ref>[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC546991/pdf/applmicro00233-0171.pdf B. Q. Ward, B. J. Carroll, E. S. Garrett, G. B. Reese.  (Technological Laboratory, U.S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, Pascagoula, Mississippi 39567)  ''Survey of the U.S. Gulf Coast for the Presence of  Clostridium botulinum''  Applied Microbiology,  Vol. 15, No. 3; May 1967, pp. 629<U+2013>636]</ref>

Toxin is produced by the bacteria when environmental conditions are favourable for the spores to replicate and grow,  but the gene that encodes for the toxin protein is actually carried by a virus or [[bacteriophage|phage]] that infects the bacteria. Unfortunately, little is known about the natural factors that control phage infection and replication within the bacteria.<ref>[http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/field_manual/chapter_38.pdf US government publications ''Field Manual of Wildlife Diseases <U+2013> Chapter 38: Avian Botulism'']</ref>

The spores require warm temperatures, a protein source and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment and moisture in order to become active and produce toxin. In the wild, decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin that may affect feeding birds and other animals. Spores are not killed by boiling; however botulism is uncommon because special, rarely obtained conditions are necessary for botulinum toxin production from C. botulinum spores, including an anaerobic, low-salt, low- acid, low-sugar environment at ambient temperatures.<ref>International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods. Clostridium botulinum. In: Micro-organisms in foods 5: characteristics of microbial pathogens. London, UK: Blackie Academic & Professional; 1996:68<U+2013>111. quoted in [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6139.pdf Botulism From Drinking Prison-Made Illicit Alcohol <U+2013> Utah 2011 CDC <U+2013> Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) / October 5, 2012 / Vol. 61 / No. 39 Bottom of p 783 ]</ref>

The toxins enter the human body in one of three ways: by colonization of the digestive tract by the bacterium; in children (infant botulism){{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} or adults (adult intestinal toxemia), by ingestion of toxin from foods (foodborne botulism) or by contamination of a wound by the bacterium (wound botulism).<ref name=Sobel>{{cite journal |author=Sobel J |title=Botulism |journal=Clin. Infect. Dis. |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=1167<U+2013>73 |year=2005 |month=October |pmid=16163636 |doi=10.1086/444507}}</ref> Person to person transmission of botulism does not occur. Improperly preserved food is the most common form of foodborne botulism. Fish that has been pickled without the salinity or acidity of the brine (that contains acetic acid and high sodium levels) and smoked fish stored at too high a temperature present a risk, as does improperly canned food. Infants under one year should not be fed honey, a natural source of botulinum bacteria, as bacteria in the gut is not sufficiently developed.

Botulinum inhibits the release of acetylcholine within the nervous system, the chemical that produces a bridge across synapses, where nerve cell axons and dendrites connect with each other. All forms lead to [[paralysis]] that typically starts with the muscles of the face and then spreads towards the limbs.<ref name=Sobel/> In severe forms, it leads to paralysis of the breathing muscles and causes [[respiratory failure]]. In light of this life-threatening complication, all suspected cases of botulism are treated as medical emergencies, and public health officials are usually involved to prevent further cases from the same source.<ref name=Sobel/>

==Signs and symptoms==
The muscle weakness of botulism characteristically starts in the muscles supplied by the [[cranial nerves]]. A group of twelve nerves controls [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]], the [[facial muscles]] and the muscles controlling [[chewing]] and [[swallowing]]. [[Diplopia|Double vision]], [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping of both eyelids]], loss of facial expression and swallowing problems may therefore occur, as well as [[dysarthria|difficulty with talking]]. The weakness then spreads to the arms (starting in the shoulders and proceeding to the forearms) and legs (again from the thighs down to the feet).<ref name=Sobel/> 

Severe botulism leads to reduced movement of the [[muscles of respiration]], and hence problems with [[gas exchange]]. This may be experienced as [[dyspnea]] (difficulty breathing), but when severe can lead to [[respiratory failure]], due to the buildup of unexhaled [[carbon dioxide]] and its resultant depressant effect on the brain. This may lead to [[coma]] and eventually death if untreated.<ref name=Sobel/>

In addition to affecting the [[Somatic nervous system|voluntary muscles]], it can also cause [[Dysautonomia|disruptions in the autonomic nervous system]]. This is experienced as [[xerostomia|a dry mouth and throat]] (due to decreased production of saliva), [[postural hypotension]] (decreased blood pressure on standing, with resultant lightheadedness and risk of blackouts), and eventually [[constipation]] (due to decreased [[peristalsis]]).<ref name=Sobel/> Some of the toxins (B and E) also precipitate [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].<ref name=Sobel/>

Clinicians frequently think of the symptoms of botulism in terms of a classic triad: [[bulbar palsy]] and descending paralysis, lack of fever, and clear senses and mental status ("clear sensorium").<ref name=outreakid>http://www.outbreakid.com/bioterrorism.htm</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=July 2011}}

===Infant botulism===
Infant botulism (also referred to as [[floppy baby syndrome]]) was first recognized in 1976, and is the most common form of botulism in the United States. There are 80 to 100 diagnosed cases of infant botulism in the United States each year.  Infants are susceptible to infant botulism in the first year of life, with more than 90% of cases occurring in infants younger than six months.<ref name="SSAIBchap">Arnon SS [http://www.infantbotulism.org/readings/ibchap.pdf Infant Botulism] In Feigin RD, CherryJD, Demmler GJ, Kaplan SL., eds. ''Textbook of Pediatric Infectious Diseases.'' 5th edition Philadelphia, PA: WB Saunders; 2004:1758<U+2013>1766</ref>  Infant botulism results from the ingestion of the [[Clostridium botulinum|''C. botulinum'']] spores, and subsequent colonization of the small intestine.  The infant gut may be colonized when the composition of the [[gut flora|intestinal microflora]] (normal flora) is insufficient to competitively inhibit the growth of [[Clostridium botulinum|''C. botulinum'']] and levels of bile acids (which normally inhibit clostridial growth) are lower than later in life.<ref name=Caya2004>{{cite journal |author=Caya JG, Agni R, Miller JE |title=Clostridium botulinum and the clinical laboratorian: a detailed review of botulism, including biological warfare ramifications of botulinum toxin |journal=Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. |volume=128 |issue=6 |pages=653<U+2013>62 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15163234 |doi=10.1043/1543-2165(2004)128<653:CBATCL>2.0.CO;2 |url=http://www.archivesofpathology.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/1543-2165(2004)128%3C653:CBATCL%3E2.0.CO;2}}</ref>

The growth of the spores releases [[botulinum toxin]], which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and taken throughout the body, causing paralysis by blocking the release of acetylcholine at the [[neuromuscular junction]].  Typical symptoms of infant botulism include constipation, lethargy, weakness, difficulty feeding and an altered cry, often progressing to a complete descending [[flaccid paralysis]].  Although constipation is usually the first symptom of infant botulism, it is commonly overlooked.

[[Honey]] is the only known dietary reservoir of [[Clostridium botulinum|''C. botulinum'']] spores linked to infant botulism.  For this reason honey should not be fed to infants less than one year of age.<ref name=Caya2004/> Other cases of infant botulism are thought to be caused by acquiring the spores from the natural environment.  ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'' is a ubiquitous soil-dwelling bacterium.  Many infant botulism patients have been demonstrated to live near a construction site or an area of soil disturbance.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Infant botulism has been reported in 49 of 50 US states,<ref name="SSAIBchap"/> and cases have been recognized in 26 countries on five continents.<ref name="globalIB">Koepke R, Sobel J and Arnon SS [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/reprint/122/1/e73 Global Occurrence of Infant Botulism, 1976<U+2013>2006] ''Pediatrics'' 2008;122;e73-e82</ref>

===Complications===
Infant botulism has no long-term side effects, but can be complicated by [[nosocomial]] adverse events. The [[case fatality]] rate is less than 1% for hospitalized infants with botulism.

Botulism can result in death due to [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] failure. However, in the past 50 years, the proportion of patients with botulism who die has fallen from about 50% to 7% due to improved supportive care. A patient with severe botulism may require [[mechanical ventilation]] (breathing support through a ventilator) as well as intensive medical and nursing care, sometimes for several months. Patients who survive an episode of botulism poisoning may have [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] and shortness of breath for years and long-term therapy may be needed to aid their recovery.

==Cause==
''[[C. botulinum]]'' is an [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram positive]], spore-forming rod. [[Botulinum toxin]] is one of the most powerful known toxins: about one [[microgram]] is lethal to humans. It acts by blocking [[nerve]] function ([[neuromuscular blockade]]) through inhibition of the excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetyl choline]]'s release from the [[presynaptic]] membrane of [[neuromuscular junction]]s in the [[somatic nervous system]]. This causes paralysis. Advanced botulism can cause [[respiratory failure]] by paralysing the muscles of the chest; this can progress to [[respiratory arrest]].

In all cases illness is caused by the botulinium toxin produced by the bacterium ''[[C. botulinum]]'' in anaerobic conditions, and not by the bacterium itself. The pattern of damage occurs because the toxin affects nerves that fire (depolarise) at a higher frequency first.<ref>Oxford Textbook of Medicine, 4th Ed., Section 7.55</ref>

Four main modes of entry for the toxin are known. The most common form in Western countries is ''infant botulism''. This occurs in small children who are [[Colonisation (biology)|colonized]] with the bacterium during the early stages of their lives. The bacterium then releases the toxin into the intestine, which is absorbed into the bloodstream. The consumption of [[honey]] during the first year of life has been identified as a risk factor for infant botulism; it is a factor in a fifth of all cases.<ref name=Sobel/> The adult form of infant botulism is termed ''adult intestinal toxemia'', and is exceedingly rare.<ref name=Sobel/>

''Foodborne botulism'' results from contaminated foodstuffs in which ''C. botulinum'' spores have been allowed to germinate in anaerobic conditions. This typically occurs in home-canned food substances and fermented uncooked dishes.{{dubious|date=February 2013}}  Given that multiple people often consume food from the same source, it is common for more than a single person to be affected simultaneously. Symptoms usually appear 12<U+2013>36 hours after eating, but can also appear within 6 hours to 10 days.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Facts About Botulism | url = http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/botulism/factsheet.asp |work=Emergency Preparedness and Response | publisher =[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]  | date =Oct 14, 2001  | accessdate = Jul 2 2011 }}</ref>

''Wound botulism'' results from the contamination of a wound with the bacteria, which then secrete the toxin into the bloodstream. This has become more common in [[Intravenous drug use (recreational)|intravenous drug users]] since the 1990s, especially people using [[black tar heroin]] and those [[skin popping|injecting heroin into the skin]] rather than the veins.<ref name=Sobel/>

Isolated cases of botulism have been described after [[inhalation]] by laboratory workers and after cosmetic use of inappropriate strengths of [[botulinum toxin|Botox]].<ref name=Sobel/>

==Diagnosis==
For infant botulism, diagnosis should be made on clinical grounds.  Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by testing of a [[stool test|stool]] or [[enema]] specimen with the mouse [[bioassay]].

Physicians may consider diagnosing botulism if the patient's history and physical examination suggest botulism. However, these clues are often not enough to allow a diagnosis. Other diseases such as [[Guillain-Barr<U+00E9> syndrome]], [[stroke]], and [[myasthenia gravis]] can appear similar to botulism, and special tests may be needed to exclude these other conditions. These tests may include a [[brain scan]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] examination, nerve conduction test ([[electromyography]], or EMG), and an [[edrophonium]] chloride (Tensilon) test for [[myasthenia gravis]]. A definite diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the food, stomach or intestinal contents, vomit or feces. The toxin is occasionally found in the blood in [[peracute]] cases. Botulinum toxin can be detected by a variety of techniques, including [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]]s (ELISAs), [[electrochemiluminescent]] (ECL) tests and mouse inoculation or feeding trials. The toxins can be typed with neutralization tests in mice. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism can be cultured from tissues. On egg yolk medium, toxin-producing colonies usually display surface iridescence that extends beyond the colony.<ref>Weber,J.T. "Botulism" In Infectious Diseases, 5th ed. Edited by P. D. Hpeprich, [[J. B. Lippincott & Co|J. B. Lippincott Company]], 1994, pp. 1185<U+2013>1194.</ref>

=== In animals ===
In cattle, the symptoms may include drooling, restlessness, uncoordination, urine retention, dysphagia, and sternal recumbency. Laterally recumbent animals are usually very close to death. In sheep, the symptoms may include drooling, a serous nasal discharge, stiffness, and incoordination. Abdominal respiration may be observed and the tail may switch on the side. As the disease progresses, the limbs may become paralyzed and death may occur.
Phosphorus-deficient cattle, especially in southern Africa, are inclined to ingest bones and carrion containing clostridial toxins and consequently suffer ''lame sickness'' or ''lamsiekte''.

The clinical signs in horses are similar to cattle. The muscle paralysis is progressive; it usually begins at the hindquarters and gradually moves to the front limbs, neck, and head. Death generally occurs 24 to 72 hours after initial symptoms and results from respiratory paralysis. Some foals are found dead without other clinical signs.

[[Domestic dog]]s may develop systemic toxemia after consuming C. botulinum type C exotoxin or spores within bird carcasses or other infected meat<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetbook.org/wiki/dog/index.php/Botulism |title=Dogs / Botulism |publisher=http://vetbook.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page |date=2012-08-12 |accessdate=2013-08-23}}</ref> but are generally resistant to the more severe effects of Clostridium botulinum type C.
Symptoms include flaccid muscle paralysis; dogs with breathing difficulties will require more intensive care monitoring.  Muscle paralysis can lead to death due to cardiac and respiratory arrest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/poultry/botulism_limberneck_western_duck_sickness/overview_of_botulism_in_poultry.html |title=Overview of botulism in poultry |publisher=http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/index.html |date=2012-03-31 |accessdate=2013-08-23}}</ref>

Pigs are relatively resistant to botulism. Reported symptoms include anorexia, refusal to drink, vomiting, pupillary dilation, and muscle paralysis.<ref>"Botulism." In the Merck Veterinary Manual, 8th ed. Edited by S.E. Aiello and A. Mays. Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck and CO., 1988, pp. 442<U+2013>444.</ref>

In poultry and wild birds, [[flaccid paralysis]] is usually seen in the legs, wings, neck and eyelids. Broiler chickens with the toxicoinfectious form may also have diarrhea with excess urates.

==Prevention==
Although the botulinum toxin is destroyed by thorough cooking over the course of a few minutes,<ref name=whodestroy/> the spore itself is not killed by the temperatures reached with normal sea-level-pressure boiling, leaving it free to grow and again produce the toxin when conditions are right.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2008/02/21/couple_suing_over_tainted_juice.html Toronto Star 2008''Couple suing over tainted juice'']</ref><ref>[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Juice/ucm072481.htm FDA Guidance for Industry: ''Refrigerated carrot juice and other refrigerated low acid juices'']</ref>

A recommended prevention measure for infant botulism is to avoid feeding honey to infants less than 12 months of age. In older children and adults the normal intestinal bacteria suppress development of ''C. botulinum''.<ref name="honey-risk">{{cite journal |title=Honey and other environmental risk factors for infant botulism |journal=[[The Journal of Pediatrics]] |date=February 1979 |author=Stephen S. Arnon ''et al.'' |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=331<U+2013>336 |pmid=368301 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(79)80863-X}}</ref>

While commercially canned goods are required to undergo a "botulinum cook" in a pressure cooker at {{convert|121|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} for 3 minutes, and so rarely cause botulism, there have been notable exceptions such as the 1978 Alaskan salmon outbreak and the 2007 [[Castleberry's Food Company]] outbreak. Foodborne botulism is the rarest form though, accounting for only around 15% of cases (US)<ref name="cdc.gov"/> and has more frequently been from [[Home canning|home-canned]] foods with low acid content, such as [[carrot juice]], [[asparagus (vegetable)|asparagus]], green [[bean]]s, [[beet]]s, and [[maize|corn]]. However, outbreaks of botulism have resulted from more unusual sources. In July 2002, fourteen [[Alaska]]ns ate ''muktuk'' ([[whale meat]]) from a [[beached whale]], and eight of them developed symptoms of botulism, two of them requiring [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Outbreak of botulism type E associated with eating a beached whale <U+2013> Western Alaska, July 2002 |journal=MMWR Morb.

Other, but much rarer sources of infection (about every decade in the US<ref name="cdc.gov"/>) include [[garlic]] or herbs<ref name="Infusions">[http://www.ext.colostate.edu/safefood/newsltr/v2n4s08.html Oil Infusions and the Risk of Botulism], Colorado State University Cooperative Extension, Safefood new <U+2013> Summer 1998 <U+2013> Vol. 2 / No. 4</ref> stored covered in [[Cooking oil|oil]] without acidification,<ref>{{cite journal |author= |title=Update: international outbreak of restaurant-associated botulism <U+2013> Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada |journal=MMWR Morb.

When canning or preserving food at home pay attention to hygiene, pressure, temperature, refrigeration and storage.
When making home preserves bottle only acidic fruit such as apples, pears, stone fruits and berries. Tropical fruit and tomatoes are low in acidity and must have some acidity added before they are bottled<ref>[http://www.public.health.wa.gov.au/2/594/2/botulism_fact_sheet.pm Government of Western Australia. Department of Health. Public Health  ''Botulism Fact Sheet''] </ref>

Oils infused with fresh garlic or herbs should be acidified and refrigerated. Potatoes which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulism toxin is destroyed by high temperatures, home-canned foods are best boiled for 10 minutes before eating.<ref>{{cite web|last=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|title=Bad Bug Book: Foodborne Pathogenic Microorganisms and Natural Toxins Handbook Clostridium botulinum|url=http://www.fda.gov/food/foodsafety/foodborneillness/foodborneillnessfoodbornepathogensnaturaltoxins/badbugbook/ucm070000.htm|accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref> Metal cans containing food in which bacteria, possibly botulinum, are growing may bulge outwards due to gas production from bacterial growth; such cans should be discarded. 

Any container of food which has been heat-treated and then assumed to be airtight which shows signs of not being so, e.g., metal cans with pinprick holes from rust or mechanical damage, should also be discarded. Contamination of a canned food solely with ''C. botulinum'' may not cause any visual defects (e.g. bulging). Only sufficient thermal processing during production should be used as a food safety control.

Wound botulism can be prevented by promptly seeking medical care for infected wounds, and by avoiding punctures by unsterile things such as needles used for street drug injections. It is currently being researched at [[USAMRIID]] under BSL-434.

==Treatment==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=February 2013}}
Most infant botulism patients require supportive care in a hospital setting.  The only drug currently available to treat infant botulism is Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous-Human (BIG-IV or BabyBIG). BabyBIG was developed by the Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program at the California Department of Public Health.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Brook I |title=Infant botulism |journal=J Perinatol |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=175<U+2013>80 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17314986 |doi=10.1038/sj.jp.7211651}}</ref>

The respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe botulism may require a patient to be on a ventilator for weeks, plus intensive medical and nursing care. After several weeks, the [[paralysis]] slowly improves. If diagnosed early, foodborne and wound botulism can be treated by inducing [[passive immunity]] with a horse-derived [[antitoxin]], which blocks the action of toxin circulating in the blood.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shapiro RL, Hatheway C, Swerdlow DL |title=Botulism in the United States: a clinical and epidemiologic review |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=221<U+2013>8 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9696731 |doi= 10.1059/0003-4819-129-3-199808010-00011|url=}}</ref> 

This can prevent patients from worsening, but recovery still takes many weeks. Physicians may try to remove contaminated food still in the stomach by inducing vomiting or by using [[enema]]s. Wounds should be treated, usually surgically, to remove the source of the toxin-producing bacteria. Good supportive care in a hospital is the mainstay of therapy for all forms of botulism.<ref>Brook I. Botulism: the challenge of diagnosis and treatment. Rev Neurol Dis. 2006;3:182-9.</ref>

Furthermore each case of food-borne botulism is a potential public health emergency in that it is necessary to identify the source of the outbreak and ensure that all persons who have been exposed to the toxin have been identified, and that no contaminated food remains.

There are two primary botulinum antitoxins available for treatment of wound and foodborne botulism. Trivalent (A,B,E) botulinum antitoxin is derived from equine sources utilizing whole [[Antibody|antibodies]] (Fab & Fc portions). This antitoxin is available from the local health department via the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]]. The second antitoxin is [[Heptavalent botulism antitoxin|heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) botulinum antitoxin]] which is derived from "despeciated" equine [[IgG]] antibodies which have had the Fc portion cleaved off leaving the F(ab')2 portions. This is a less immunogenic antitoxin that is effective against all known strains of botulism where not contraindicated. This is available from the [[US Army]]. On 1 June 2006 the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]] awarded a $363 million contract with Cangene Corporation for 200,000 doses of heptavalent botulinum antitoxin over five years for delivery into the [[Strategic National Stockpile]] beginning in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.hhs.gov/news/press/2006pres/20060601.html |title=HHS Awards BioShield Contract For Botulism Antitoxin |date=June 1, 2006 |work=HHS Archive |publisher=Department of Health and Human Services |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
{{Contradict|section|date=September 2012|about=the U.S. death rate: is it 2% or 7.5%?}}
Infant botulism has no long-term side effects, but can be complicated by [[nosocomial]] adverse events. The [[case fatality]] rate is less than 1% for hospitalized infants with botulism.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Between 1910 and 1919 the death rate from botulism was 70% in the United States, dropping to 9% in the 1980s and 2% in the early 1990s, mainly because of the development of artificial respirators. Up to 60% of botulism cases are fatal if left untreated.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that the current mortality rate is 5% (type B) to 10% (type A).{{clarify|date=February 2009|reason="type a" and "type b" not discussed in article}} Other sources report that, in the U.S., the overall mortality rate is about 7.5%, but the mortality rate among adults over 60  is 30%. The mortality rate for wound botulism is about 10%. The infant botulism mortality rate is about 1.3%.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Death from botulism is common in waterfowl; an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 birds die of botulism annually. In some large outbreaks, a million or more birds may die. Ducks appear to be affected most often. Botulism also affects commercially raised poultry. In chickens, the mortality rate varies from a few birds to 40% of the flock. Some affected birds may recover without treatment.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Botulism seems to be relatively uncommon in domestic mammals; however, in some parts of the world, epidemics with up to 65% mortality are seen in cattle. The prognosis is poor in large animals that are recumbent. Most dogs with botulism recover within 2 weeks.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Epidemiology==
Between 1990 and 2000, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported 263 individual 'cases' from 160 foodborne botulism 'events' in the United States with a case-fatality rate of 4%. Thirty-nine percent (103 cases and 58 events) occurred in Alaska, all of which were attributable to traditional Alaska aboriginal foods. In the lower 49 states, home-canned food was implicated in 70 (91%) events with canned asparagus being the most numerous cause. Two restaurant-associated outbreaks affected 25 persons. The median number of cases per year was 23 (range 17<U+2013>43), the median number of events per year was 14 (range 9<U+2013>24). The highest incidence rates occurred in Alaska, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. All other states had an incidence rate of 1 case per ten million people or less.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sobel |first=Jeremy |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |date= September 2004 |title=Foodborne Botulism in the United States, 1990<U+2013>2000 |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no9/03-0745.htm |accessdate=September 29, 2010 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The number of cases of food borne and infant botulism has changed little in recent years, but wound botulism has increased because of the use of [[black tar heroin]], especially in [[California]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Passaro DJ, Werner SB, McGee J, Mac Kenzie WR, Vugia DJ |title=Wound botulism associated with black tar heroin among injecting drug users |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=11 |pages=859<U+2013>63 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9516001 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.11.859}}</ref>

==Outbreaks==

Clostridium botulinum has been associated with one outbreak linked to venison jerky. The investigation done of this outbreak showed that toxin could be repeatedly demonstrated in the jerky, but the organism was only isolated once.  It was never isolated from any of the raw materials used to make the jerky and no conclusions were drawn as to how the organism came to produce toxin within the product.

===Outbreak in the US of type B botulism from home canned jalape<U+00F1>o peppers===

Between March 31 and April 6, 1977, 59 individuals developed type B botulism. All ill persons had eaten at the same Mexican restaurant and all had consumed a hot sauce made with improperly home-canned jalape<U+00F1>o peppers, either by adding it to their food, or by eating a nacho that had had hot sauce used in its preparation. 
The full clinical spectrum (mild symptomatology with neurologic findings through life-threatening ventilatory paralysis) of type B botulism was documented.

===Outbreak in the UK from hazelnut yoghurt===
The largest recorded outbreak of foodborne botulism in the United Kingdom occurred in June 1989. A total of 27 patients were affected; one patient died. Twenty-five of the patients had eaten one brand of hazelnut yoghurt in the week before the onset of symptoms. This yoghurt contained hazelnut conserve sweetened with [[aspartame]] rather than sugar. Control measures included the cessation of all yoghurt production by the implicated producer, the withdrawal of the firm's yoghurts from sale, the recall of cans of the hazelnut conserve, and advice to the general public to avoid the consumption of all hazelnut yoghurts.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2271776/]

===Baked potato  in El Paso, Texas===
In April 1994, the largest outbreak of botulism in the United States since 1978 occurred in El Paso, Texas. Thirty persons were affected; 4 required mechanical ventilation. All ate food from a Greek restaurant. The attack rate among persons who ate a potato-based dip was 86% (19/22) compared with 6% (11/176) among persons who did not eat the dip (relative risk [RR] <U+00C5> 13.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.6<U+2013>25.1). The attack rate among persons who ate an eggplant-based dip was 67% (6/9) compared with 13% (24/189) among persons who did not (RR <U+00C5> 5.2; 95% CI, 2.9<U+2013>9.5). Botulism toxin type A was detected from patients and in both dips. Toxin formation resulted from holding aluminum foil <U+2013> wrapped baked potatoes at room temperature, apparently for several 
days, before they were used in the dips. Food handlers should be informed of the potential hazards caused by holding foil-wrapped potatoes at ambient temperatures after cooking.<ref>*[http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/178/1/172.full.pdf ''A Large Outbreak of Botulism: The Hazardous Baked Potato''  Frederick J.

===Castleberry's Food Company outbreak===
{{Main|Castleberry's Food Company}}
Beginning in late June 2007, 8 people contracted botulism poisoning by eating canned food products produced by [[Castleberry's Food Company]] in its [[Augusta, Georgia]] plant. It was later identified that the Castleberry's plant had serious production problems on a specific line of retorts that had under-processed the cans of food. These issues included broken cooking alarms, leaking water valves and inaccurate temperature devices, all the result of poor management of the company.

All of the victims were hospitalized and placed on mechanical ventilation. The Castleberry's Food Company outbreak was the first instance of botulism in commercial canned foods in the United States in over 30 years.

===Bon Vivant incident===
{{Main|1971 Bon Vivant botulism case}}
On July 2, 1971, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) released a public warning after learning that a New York man had died and his wife had become seriously ill due to botulism after eating a can of Bon Vivant [[vichyssoise]] soup.

===US annual botulism statistics===
All data regarding botulism antitoxin releases and laboratory confirmation of cases in the US are recorded annually by CDC [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]
and published on their [http://www.cdc.gov/nationalsurveillance/botulism_surveillance.html website]

==In other species==
Botulism can occur in many [[vertebrate]]s and [[invertebrate]]s. Botulism has been reported in rats, mice, chicken, frogs, toads, goldfish, [[aplysia]], squid, crayfish, [[drosophila]], leeches, etc.<ref name="pmid10865130">{{cite journal |author=Humeau Y, Doussau F, Grant NJ, Poulain B |title=How botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins block neurotransmitter release |journal=Biochimie |volume=82 |issue=5 |pages=427<U+2013>46 |year=2000 |month=May |pmid=10865130 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9084(00)00216-9 |url=}}</ref>
