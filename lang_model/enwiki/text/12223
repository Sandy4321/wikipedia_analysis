Four years later, Samuelsson attracted media attention after being left off the Swedish roster for the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics]]. He told reporters, "I pretty much have one comment and maybe I'll regret it. But they (Team Sweden officials) can go fuck themselves," adding that he was not interested in being later added to the roster in the event of an injury.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Samuelsson outraged by Olympic hockey snub|url=http://www.thelocal.se/24104/20091229/|accessdate=2010-01-04|date=2009-12-29|publisher=''[[The Local]]''}}</ref> His omission was highly publicized by Swedish media as he was in the midst of a career season with the Canucks (he went on to record the second-highest goals total among Swedish NHLers that season in [[2009<U+2013>10 NHL season|2009<U+2013>10]] with 30).<ref>{{citeweb|title=Player Stats - 2009-10 - Regular Season - All Skaters - SWE - Summary - Total Goals|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/playerstats.htm?fetchKey=20102ALLSASSWE&sort=goals&viewName=summary|accessdate=2010-04-27|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]}}</ref> Sweden went on to lose to [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovakia]] in the quarterfinal, failing to medal.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Tournament Progress|url=http://stats.iihf.com/og2010/IHM400100_76B_16_0.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-14|publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]]|format=PDF}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Samuelsson's primary offensive attribute is his shot. Rather than relying on stickhandling in the offensive zone, his primary tendency is to direct the puck towards the net, hoping for a rebound.<ref>{{citenews|title=Samuelsson scores from his favourite spot against Blackhawks in Game 1|url=http://www.mlive.com/redwings/index.ssf/2009/05/red_wings_mikael_samuelsson_sc.html|accessdate=2010-12-14|date=2009-05-17|publisher=Michigan Live}}</ref> Before becoming an offensive threat later in his career, he established himself first as a defensively repsonsible forward in the NHL, earning time on the penalty kill and against opposing team's top players.<ref name=defence/> Strong on his skates,<ref>{{citenews|title=Olympic snub drives Samuelsson to greater heights|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=513712|accessdate=2010-12-14|publisher=[[National Hockey League]]|date=2010-01-15}}</ref> he is also noted to play aggressively, as well.
