'''Constance of France''' (1078 - 14 September 1126<ref>{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/CAPET.htm#Constancedied1126 |title-date= |title= Medlands Proyect: CAPET|date=August 2012}}</ref>) was the daughter of King [[Philip I of France]] and [[Bertha of Holland]]. She was a member of the [[House of Capet]] and was princess of [[Antioch]] from her second marriage and Countess of [[Champagne, France|Troyes]] from her first marriage. She was regent during the minority of her son.

==Family==
Her mother was repudiated by her father for [[Bertrade de Montfort]]. It caused the displeasure of the church and an [[interdict]] was placed on France several times as a result. Constance was the eldest of five children and was the only daughter of her father from his first marriage. Constance's brother was [[Louis VI of France]].

Her maternal grandparents were [[Floris I, Count of Holland]] and his [[Gertrude of Saxony]]. Constance's paternal grandparents were [[Henry I of France]] and his second wife [[Anne of Kiev]].

==First marriage==
[[File:Filip1 berta Ludvik Konstance.jpg|thumb|left|Philip, Bertha, Louis (with Philip) and Constance (with Bertha)]]

Between 1093 and 1095 Philip I had his daughter, Constance married to [[Hugh, Count of Champagne|Hugh I, Count of Troyes]].<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p10520.htm#i105199 Constance of France, thePeerage.com]</ref> Philip's purpose with this marriage was to influence Hugh's family, the powerful [[House of Blois]], to offset the opposition of Count [[Fulk IV of Anjou]] since Philip had stolen Fulk's wife, Bertrade. But this union was made much too late, Hugh's brother, [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]], holder of most counties of the House of Blois was married. Stephen had married [[Adela of Normandy]], daughter of [[William I of England]], and their marriage had produced children. This marriage was not beneficial to Constance's father in any way now but Constance remained married to Hugh. Constance and Hugh had a son, Manasses, who died young around 1102.<ref>{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/CHAMPAGNE%20NOBILITY.htm#HuguesITroyesdied1126 |title-date= |title= Medlands Proyect: CHAMPAGNE NOBILITY|date=August 2012}}</ref> 

After ten years, Constance demanded an annulment of their marriage, for unknown reasons.<ref>In a charter dated 1102 under which "''Constantia, Philippi regis Francorum filia<U+2026>Hugonis comitis Trecensium coniux legitima''" donated property to the Abbey of Molesme, the suggestion being that the reference to "''coniux legitima''" indicates that her husband may have had another "unofficial" relationship at this time. Medlands Proyect: CAPET</ref> Constance obtained a divorce at [[Soissons]] on 25 December 1104, under grounds of consanguinity.<ref>Ivo of Chartes, ''Epistol<U+00E6>'', in Migne, J. P. (ed.) ''Patrologi<U+00E6> cursus completes, serie Latina CLXII'', pp. 163-4 ep. 158, cited in Chibnall, Vol. VI, p. 70 footnote 5.</ref> Four years later (1108) King Philip I died and her brother Louis VI became [[King of France]]. Louis VI successfully restored the royal authority and tamed the unruly vassals. Constance could never expect help from her indolent father during her separation but she could from her brother.<ref>[[:fr:Constance de France, fille de Philippe Ier|Translation from French Wikipedia]]</ref>

==Second marriage==
[[File:Marriage.jpg|thumb|right|Marriage of Bohemond and Constance]]
Constance went to the court of Adela, wife of Stephen. She was acting as [[regent]] since Stephen was killed in the [[Holy Land]]. Adela was well educated and all seemed to be well at the Court. It appeared that Adela used all her power to help Constance get a divorce from Hugh, who later left to fight in the [[Holy Land]].

At the same time, [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] was just released by the [[Turkish people|Turks]]. He returned to [[Europe]] to obtain relief for the Crusaders in the Holy Land. The regency of the Principality of [[Antioch]] was assured by Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee]]. Bohemond now needed a wife. He impressed audiences across France with gifts of relics from the Holy Land and tales of heroism while fighting the Saracens, gathering a large army in the process. [[Henry I of England]] famously prevented him from landing on English shores, so great was his influence expected to be on the English nobility. His new-found status won him the hand of Constance. Of this marriage wrote Abbot Suger:

<blockquote>Bohemond came to France to seek by any means he could the hand of the Lord Louis' sister Constance, a young lady of excellent breeding, elegant appearance and beautiful face. So great was the reputation for valour of the French kingdom and of the Lord Louis that even the [[Saracens]] were terrified by the prospect of that marriage. She was not engaged since she had broken off her agreement to wed Hugh, count of Troyes, and wished to avoid another unsuitable match. The prince of Antioch was experienced and rich both in gifts and promises; he fully deserved the marriage, which was celebrated with great pomp by the bishop of Chartres in the presence of the king, the Lord Louis, and many archbishops, bishops and noblemen of the realm.</blockquote>

The marriage was celebrated in the cathedral of [[Chartres]] between 25 March and 26 May 1106, and the festivities were held at the court of Adela, who also took part in negotiations. The groom took the opportunity to encourage the nobility to fight in the Holy Land, and also negotiated for a marriage between Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee]] and Constance's half-sister [[Cecile of France]].

Pleased by his success, Bohemond resolved to use his army of 34,000 men, not to defend [[Antioch]] against the Greeks, but to attack [[Alexios I Komnenos]]. He did so; but Alexius, aided by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], proved too strong, and Bohemond had to submit to a humiliating peace, (the Treaty of Devol in 1108).

After her marriage, Constance accompanied her husband to [[Apulia]], where she gave birth to their first son, [[Bohemond II of Antioch|Bohemond]], future Prince of Antioch, between 1107 and 1108. A second son, John, was also born in Apulia between 1108 and 1111, but died in early infancy, ca. 1115-1120.<ref>Suger, ''Vita Ludovici Grossi Regis'', vol. IX, p. 31.</ref> Bohemond became the vassal of Alexius, consented to receive his pay, with the title of ''sebastos'', and promised to cede disputed territories and to admit a Greek [[patriarch]] into Antioch. Henceforth Bohemond was a broken man. He died without returning to the East, and was buried at [[Canosa]] in Apulia, in 1111.

==Widowhood==
Constance acted as regent of the duchies of [[Calabria]] and [[Apuleius]] on behalf of her son <ref>{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/CAPET.htm#Constancedied1126 |title-date= |title= CAPET, Medieval Lands|date=August 2012}}</ref> and took the title of Queen as a daughter of the King of France, but she was imprisoned by [[Grimoald Alferanites]], who proclaimed himself [[Lord of Bari]]. Constance was released in 1120 on the intervention of King [[Roger II of Sicily]] and the [[Pope]],<ref name="Constance Cap<U+00E9>tiens">[http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en;i=517122 Constance (Cap<U+00E9>tiens)]</ref> but in exchange for her release, Constance had to give up the regency over her son.

She died on 14 September 1126, and Bohemond II then went to take over his principality of Antioch.

Constance's granddaughter, also called [[Constance of Antioch|Constance]], became Princess of Antioch. Her children included: [[Maria of Antioch|Maria, Byzantine Empress]], [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] and [[Agnes of Antioch|Agnes, Queen of Hungary]].
