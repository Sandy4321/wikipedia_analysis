'''''Voroshilov''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0412><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0448><U+0438><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432>}}) was a Project 26 {{sclass|Kirov|cruiser}} of the [[Soviet Navy]] that served during [[World War II]] and into the [[Cold War]]. She bombarded German troops during the [[Siege of Odessa]] before being badly damaged in November 1941 by German bombers. Upon her return from repairs in March 1942 she supported Soviet troops during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941<U+2013>1942)|Siege of Sevastopol]], the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941<U+2013>1942)#The Soviet landing at Kerch|Kerch-Feodosiya Operation]] and the amphibious landings at [[Malaya Zemlya|Novorossiysk]] at the end of January 1943. Her active participation in the war ended in October 1943 when three destroyers were lost to air attack and Joseph Stalin forbid missions using large ships without his permission. Postwar she was converted to a missile test ship before being sold for [[scrap]] in 1973.

==Description==
''Voroshilov'' was {{convert|191.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|17.66|m|ftin|sp=us}} and had a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|6.15|m|ftin|sp=us}}. She displaced {{convert|7890|t|LT|0|lk=on|sp=us}} at standard load and {{convert|9436|t|LT|sp=us}} at full load.<ref>Yakubov and Worth, p. 84</ref> Her two [[steam turbine]]s proved to be more powerful than anticipated, producing a total of {{convert|122500|shp|kW|lk=on}}. This was almost enough to achieve the ship's designed speed of 37 knots during her [[sea trial]]s, reaching {{convert|36.72|knots|lk=on}} despite being over {{convert|650|t|LT|sp=us}} overweight.<ref name=y4>Yakubov and Worth, p. 90</ref>

''Voroshilov'' carried nine {{convert|180|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 57-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] B-1-P guns in three electrically powered MK-3-180 triple turrets.<ref name=y4/> Her secondary armament consisted of six single {{convert|100|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 56-caliber B-34 [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns fitted on each side of the rear funnel. The ship's light AA guns consisted of six semi-automatic [[45 mm anti-aircraft gun (21-K)|{{convert|45|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 21-K]] AA guns and four [[DShK|DK]] {{convert|12.7|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} machine guns.<ref name=y67>Yakubov and Worth, pp. 86<U+2013>7</ref> Six {{convert|533|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} 39-Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings.<ref name=y8>Yakubov and Worth, p. 88</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
When war broke out in 1941, ''Voroshilov'' was not equipped with any radars, but she received a number of British [[Lend-Lease]] radars by 1944. One [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 284|Type 284]] and two [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 285|Type 285]] radars were used for main battery fire control. One [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 291|Type 291]] was used for air search, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 282|Type 282]] radars.<ref name=y8/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_Radar.htm|title=British Naval Radar Equipment of World War II|accessdate=9 August 2009|publisher=navweaps.com}}</ref>

==Service==
''Voroshilov'' was laid down at the [[Black Sea Shipyard|Marti South shipyard]] in [[Mykolaiv|Nikolayev]] on 15 October 1935; the second of the Project 26, to use their industrial designation, ''Kirov''-class cruisers. She was launched on 28 June 1937, but she had to wait for her Soviet-built machinery to be delivered before she was completed on 20 June 1940. On 23 June 1941 ''Voroshilov'' covered Soviet [[destroyer]]s bombarding [[Constanta]], after the [[Operation Barbarossa|Germans attacked the Soviet Union]], and was slightly damaged by a mine exploded by the destroyer [[Soviet destroyer Soobrazitelny|''Soobrazitelny'']]'s [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]]. She bombarded German troops near [[Odessa]] on 19 September with 148 180&nbsp;mm shells, but was transferred to [[Novorossiysk]] shortly afterwards.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 82<U+2013>3, 101</ref> On 2 November the ship was bombed in harbor by [[Junkers Ju 88]] bombers of [[Kampfgeschwader 51]]. She was hit twice; one hit started a fire in #3 [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] that was extinguished by water flooding in from the second hit.<ref name=Y92>Yakubov and Worth, p. 92</ref> ''Voroshilov'' had to be towed to [[Poti]] for repairs, which lasted until February 1942. She shelled Axis positions near [[Feodosiya]] on 19 March and 3 April 1942, but was damaged by fragments from bombs from Ju 88s on 10 April and had to return to [[Batumi]] for minor repairs.<ref name="bsf">{{cite web|url=http://flot.sevastopol.info/ship/cruiser/voroshilov.htm|title=Cruiser Voroshilov|language=Russian|accessdate=9 August 2009|publisher=Black Sea Fleet}}</ref>

On 8 and 11 May she provided fire support for Soviet troops around [[Kerch]] and the [[Taman Peninsula]]. On the 27 May one of her turbines broke down, while helping to transfer the 9th Naval Infantry Brigade from Batumi to [[Sevastopol]], and required repairs lasting until 24 July 1942. On 29 November 1942 she was damaged by nearby [[Naval mine|mine]] explosions while bombarding [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|Feodonisi]] with 46 180&nbsp;mm and 57 100&nbsp;mm shells, but managed to return to Poti under her own power. Just after her repairs were completed she assisted Soviet forces landing behind German lines at [[Malaya Zemlya]] with 240 180&nbsp;mm shells at the end of January 1943. On 17 February the ship transferred from Poti to Batumi.<ref name=Y92/>

''Voroshilov'' was withdrawn from active operations, however, after the loss of three destroyers that were attempting to interdict the German evacuation of the Taman Bridgehead to air attack on 6 October 1943. This loss caused [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission which was not granted during the rest of the war.<ref>Whitley, p. 211</ref> The ship was transferred to Novorossiysk on 18 August 1944 and to Sevastopol on 5 November.<ref name=Y92/> She was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] on 8 July 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sovnavy-ww2.by.ru/cruisers/typ_kirov.htm|title=Type Kirov|language=Russian|accessdate=8 August 2009|publisher=sovnavy-ww2.by.ru}}</ref>

==Postwar==

''Voroshilov'' was inspected in 1946 and found unsatisfactory, but she was given routine servicing.<ref name=Y92/> She began her postwar modernization in April 1954, but the Navy reevaluated the scope of the work in 1955 and deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship. Unlike her [[sister ship|half-sister]] {{ship|Soviet cruiser|Maxim Gorky||2}}, she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956. The conversion process was prolonged, as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts. She consequently was not recommissioned as ''OS-24'' until 31 December 1961. The ship was modernized under Project 33M from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965. Her final conversion was to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972 and she was redesignated as ''PKZ-19''. ''Voroshilov'' was sold for scrapping on 2 March 1973.<ref>Yakubov and Worth, pp. 91<U+2013>2</ref> ''Voroshilov''{{'}}s 14-ton [[propeller]] and 2.5-ton stop [[anchor]] are on display at the Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol on Sapun Mountain in [[Sevastopol]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol|title=Sapun Mountain Guide|publisher=PoliPRESS Publisher|location=Simferopol|date=2006|page=140|language=Russian}}</ref>
