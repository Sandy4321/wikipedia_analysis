==High School Years==

Since his departure from NIU, two records (rushing yards and touchdowns) have been broken by [[Garrett Wolfe]].

==NFL career==
The Chargers [[NFL draft|drafted]] Turner in the fifth round in the [[2004 NFL Draft]]. As a rookie, he played mostly on [[special teams]], but started and ran for 87 yards in the regular-season finale against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].

Turner has again spent most of [[2005]] on the bench as backup to [[Pro Bowl]] starter [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]. But in the [[December 18]] game against the undefeated [[Indianapolis Colts]], Turner came off the bench to run for 113 yards, including a game-clinching 83-yard touchdown. 

Since his career started he has rushed for 716 yards and 4 touchdowns on 118 carries (as of Oct. 19, 2006). He also has 4 catches for eight yards. As of the end of the 2005-2006 season Turner's 5.7 yards per carry average is the highest among active players.

Turner becomes eligible for [[restricted free agency]] at the end of the 2006-2007 season. 

During the [[2007]] off season, Chargers General manager A.J. Smith stated that the Chargers would be willing to trade Turner in exchange for both a first and third round draft pick.<ref>SignOnSanDiego [http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/chargers/20070330-1744-fbn-chargers-turner.html]</ref>
