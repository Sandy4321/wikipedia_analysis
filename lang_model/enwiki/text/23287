'''Kylie Ann Minogue''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|a<U+026A>|l|i<U+02D0>|_|m|<U+0268>|<U+02C8>|n|o<U+028A>|<U+0261>}}; born 28 May 1968), often [[Mononymous person|known simply as]] '''Kylie''', is an Australian singer-songwriter and actress, working and living in London. After beginning her career as a child actress on Australian television, she achieved recognition through her role in the television soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', before beginning her career as a recording artist in 1987.

Minogue has achieved worldwide record sales of more than 70 million,<ref name=KylieMillions>{{cite web|title=Kylie Minogue To Be Honored With Australia's Top Live Entertainment Award|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1568570/kylie-minogue-to-be-honored-with-australias-top-live-entertainment-award|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=23 November 2013|date=28 June 2013}}</ref> and has received notable music awards, including multiple [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA]] and [[Brit Awards]] and a [[Grammy Award]]. She has mounted several successful and critically acclaimed concert world tours and received a [[Mo Award]] for "Australian Entertainer of the Year" for her live performances. She was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 2008 "for services to music". In the same year she was appointed by the French Government as a Chevalier (knight) of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]], the junior grade of France's highest cultural honour, for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2011 her hit single "[[I Should Be So Lucky]]" was added to the [[National Film and Sound Archive]] of Australia's [[Sounds of Australia]] registry.<ref>National Film and Sound Archive: 'I Should Be So Lucky' on the [http://nfsa.gov.au/collection/sound/sounds-australia/ Sounds of Australia registry]</ref><ref>National Film and Sound Archive: [http://aso.gov.au/titles/music/i-should-be-so-lucky/ 'I Should Be So Lucky'] on [http://aso.gov.au/ australianscreen online]</ref> The same year, Minogue was awarded an honorary [[Doctor of Health Science]] (D.H.Sc.) degree by [[Anglia Ruskin University]] in the United Kingdom for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. In November 2011, on the 25th anniversary of the [[ARIA Music Awards]], Minogue was inducted by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]].<ref>''Daily Telegraph'' (Australia). [http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/prime-minister-julia-gillard-to-honour-pop-princess-kylie-minogue/story-e6frewyr-1226205421573 "Prime Minister Julia Gillard to honour pop princess Kylie Minogue"]</ref>

Her first single, "[[The Locomotion (Kylie Minogue song)|The Loco-Motion]]", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles chart and became the highest-selling single of the decade in Australia. This led to a contract with the British songwriters and [[record producer|producers]] [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock, Aitken & Waterman]]. Her debut album, ''[[Kylie (album)|Kylie]]'' (1988), and the single "[[I Should Be So Lucky]]", both performed well on international charts, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom. Initially presented as a "[[girl next door]]", Minogue attempted to convey a more mature style in her music and public image. Her singles were well received, but after four albums her sales were declining, and she left Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992 to establish herself as an independent performer. Her next single, "[[Confide in Me]]", reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with [[Nick Cave]], "[[Where the Wild Roses Grow]]", brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997).

Minogue returned to prominence in 2000 with the single "[[Spinning Around]]" and the dance-oriented album ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'', and she performed during the closing ceremonies of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]]. Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed. "[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]" reached number one in more than 40 countries, and the album ''[[Fever (Kylie Minogue album)|Fever]]'' (2001) was a hit in many countries, including the US, a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition. In 2005, in the middle of a concert tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, forcing her to cancel the tour. After treatment, she resumed her career in 2006 with the ''[[Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour]]''. In 2009, she embarked upon her ''[[For You, For Me]]'' tour, her first concert tour of the US and Canada.

In 2014, Minogue released her 12th album ''Kiss Me Once'', while also appearing as a judge on the [[The Voice UK (series 3)|third series]] of ''[[The Voice UK]]'' and the third series of ''[[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]]''. Minogue later confirmed that she would not be returning to ''The Voice UK'' for the fourth series due to the dates clashing with her tour.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s154/the-voice-uk/news/a564029/the-voice-uk-kylie-minogue-confirms-exit-blames-tour-dates.html</ref>

The Minogue sisters began their careers as children on Australian television.<ref name="WhyweloveKylie"/> From the age of 11, Kylie appeared in small roles in soap operas such as ''[[The Sullivans]]'' and ''[[Skyways (TV series)|Skyways]]'', and in 1985 was cast in one of the lead roles in ''[[The Henderson Kids]]''.<ref name="onscreen">{{Cite news| last = Wearring| first = Miles| title = Kylie's life on screen | work = Herald Sun | date = 28 May 2008| url = http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,26278,23769961-10388,00.html| accessdate =26 July 2009}}</ref> Interested in following a career in music, she made a [[demo (music)|demo tape]] for the producers of the weekly music programme ''[[Young Talent Time]]'',<ref name="20yearson">{{Cite news| last = Adams| first = Cameron| title = Kylie Minogue&nbsp;<U+2013> 20 years on | work=Herald Sun| date = 2 August 2007| url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22171653-2902,00.html| accessdate =27 July 2009}}</ref> which featured Dannii as a regular performer.<ref>Smith, p. 16</ref> Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast.

''Neighbours'' achieved popularity in the UK, and a [[story arc]] that created a romance between [[Scott Robinson and Charlene Mitchell|her character]] and the character played by [[Jason Donovan]], culminated in a [[Episode 523 (Neighbours)|wedding episode]] in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20&nbsp;million British viewers.<ref name="celebrates40thbirthday">{{Cite news| last = Simpson| first = Aislinn| title = Kylie Minogue celebrates 40th birthday |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | date = 27 May 2008| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2036175/Kylie-Minogue-celebrates-40th-birthday.html| accessdate =26 July 2009}}</ref>

Her popularity in Australia was demonstrated when she became the first person to win four [[Logie Award]]s in one event, and the youngest recipient of the "[[Gold Logie]]" as the country's "Most Popular Television Performer", with the result determined by public vote.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Logies | publisher=TelevisionAU | url = http://www.televisionau.com/logies.htm | accessdate =26 January 2006}}</ref>

===1987<U+2013>89: ''Kylie'' and ''Enjoy Yourself''===
During a [[Fitzroy Football Club]] benefit concert with other ''Neighbours'' cast members, Minogue performed "[[I Got You Babe]]" as a duet with the actor [[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]], and "The Loco-Motion" as an encore, and was subsequently signed to a recording contract with [[Mushroom Records]] in 1987.<ref>Smith, p. 18</ref> Her first single, "[[The Locomotion (Kylie Minogue song)|The Loco-Motion]]", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and it became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite news| last = Maley| first = Jacqueline| title = 20 years at the top: she should be so lucky |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 5 August 2007| url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/she-should-be-so-lucky/2007/08/04/1185648204390.html| accessdate =26 July 2009}}</ref> She received the [[ARIA Award]] for the year's highest-selling single.<ref>{{cite web| title = 1988: 2nd Annual ARIA Awards| url = http://www.ariaawards.com.au/history/year/1988| publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]| accessdate =5 June 2012}}</ref> Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers [[Stock, Aitken & Waterman]].

Minogue's debut album, ''[[Kylie (album)|Kylie]]'' was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of [[dance-pop|dance-oriented pop tunes]] and it spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one.<ref name="Britishcharts">Brown, Kutner, Warwick, pp. 673<U+2013>674</ref> The album went gold in the United States, and the single, "The Loco-Motion", reached number three on the US ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart,<ref name="billboardhot100chart">{{cite web| title = Kylie Minogue, Chart History, Hot 100| url = {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=kylie minogue|chart=all}}|work=Billboard | accessdate =25 July 2009}}</ref> and number one on the [[Canadian Singles Chart]].

Minogue also collaborated with [[Jason Donovan]] for the song "[[Especially for You]]". It peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and sold almost one million copies. Minogue was sometimes referred to as "the Singing [[Budgerigar|Budgie]]" by her detractors over the coming years,<ref>{{cite web| last = Coorey| first = Madeleine| title = Kylie costumes thrill fans|work=The Standard |location=Hong Kong| date = 2006-03-0| url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=18&art_id=13262&sid=6891429&con_type=1| accessdate =2 September 2006}}</ref> however Chris True's comment about the album ''Kylie'' for [[AllMusic]] suggests that Minogue's appeal transcended the limitations of her music, by noting that "her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable".<ref>{{cite web| last = True| first = Chris | title = Kylie Review| publisher=AllMusic| date = 13 July 2005| url = http://music.yahoo.com/library/default.asp?m=content&add=review&i=14177772&| accessdate =25 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Minogue's second album ''[[Enjoy Yourself (Kylie Minogue album)|Enjoy Yourself]]'' was released in October 1989. The album was a success in the United Kingdom, Europe, New Zealand, Asia and Australia. The album spawned number one singles "[[Hand on Your Heart]]" and "[[Tears on My Pillow]]".<ref name="Britishcharts"/> However, the album failed to sell well throughout North America, and Minogue was dropped by her American record label [[Geffen Records]]. She then embarked on her first concert tour, the [[Enjoy Yourself Tour]], in the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and Australia in February 1990. She was also one of the featured vocalists on the remake of "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]".<ref name="Smith220">Smith, p. 220</ref>

Her debut film, ''[[The Delinquents (1989 film)|The Delinquents]]'' was released in December 1989. The movie was poorly received by critics but it proved popular with audiences. In the UK it grossed more than [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]200,000,<ref>{{cite web| title =Australian films earning over <U+00A3>200,000 gross at the UK box office, 1979&nbsp;<U+2013> March 2006| publisher=[[Australian Film Commission]]|date=April 2006| url =http://www.afc.gov.au/gtp/mrboxuk.html| accessdate =21 January 2007}}</ref> and in Australia, it was the fourth-highest grossing local film of 1989 and the highest grossing local film of 1990.<ref>{{cite web| title =Top five Australian feature films each year, and gross Australian box office earned that year, 1988<U+2013>2005| publisher=[[Australian Film Commission]]| date =31 December 2005| url =http://www.afc.gov.au/GTP/mrboxausttop5.html| accessdate =21 January 2007}}</ref>

===1990<U+2013>92: ''Rhythm of Love'' and ''Let's Get to It''===
Minogue's third album, ''[[Rhythm of Love (Kylie Minogue album)|Rhythm of Love]]'' was released in November 1990. The album presented a more sophisticated and adult style of dance music and also marked the first signs of her rebellion against her production team and the "girl-next-door" image.<ref>Baker and Minogue, p. 29</ref> Determined to be accepted by a more mature audience, Minogue took control of her music videos, starting with "[[Better the Devil You Know]]", and presented herself as a sexually aware adult.<ref>Baker and Minogue, p. 32</ref> Her relationship with [[Michael Hutchence]] was also seen as part of her departure from her earlier persona.<ref>{{Cite news| last =McLuckie| first =Kirsty| title =Dating Danger|work=The Scotsman |location=UK| date =23 January 2003| url =http://news.scotsman.com/kylieminogue/Call-it-chemistry-Kylie-Minogue.2293601.jp| accessdate =26 January 2006}}</ref> The singles from ''Rhythm of Love'' sold well in Europe and Australia. She then later embarked on the [[Rhythm of Love Tour]] in February 1991.

Minogue's fourth album, ''[[Let's Get to It]]'' was released in October 1991 and it reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart. It was her first album to fail to reach the top ten.<ref name="Britishcharts" /> While the first single from the album, "[[Word Is Out (song)|Word Is Out]]" became her first single to miss the top ten of the UK Singles Chart,<ref name="Britishcharts" /> though subsequent singles "[[If You Were with Me Now]]" and "[[Give Me Just a Little More Time]]" reached the top five respectively.<ref name="Britishcharts" /> In support of the album, she embarked on the [[Let's Get to It Tour]] in October. She had fulfilled the requirements of her contract and elected not to renew it.<ref name="WhyweloveKylie" /> She later expressed her opinion that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, and said, "I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right."<ref name="Shuker164">Shuker, p. 164</ref>

Minogue's first ''[[Greatest Hits (Kylie Minogue album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album was released in August 1992. It reached number one in the United Kingdom<ref name="Britishcharts"/> and number three in Australia.<ref>{{cite web| title = Kylie Minogue: Greatest Hits (album)| publisher=Media Jungen| url = http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kylie+Minogue&titel=Greatest+Hits&cat=a| accessdate =26 July 2009}}</ref> The singles from the album, "[[What Kind of Fool (Heard All That Before)|What Kind of Fool]]" and her cover version of [[Kool & the Gang]]'s "[[Celebration (Kool & the Gang song)|Celebration]]" both reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart.<ref name="Britishcharts"/>

===1993<U+2013>98: ''Kylie Minogue'' and ''Impossible Princess''===
Minogue's signing with [[Deconstruction Records]] was highly touted in the music media as the beginning of a new phase in her career. Her fifth album ''[[Kylie Minogue (album)|Kylie Minogue]]'' was released in September 1994 which sold well in Europe and Australia. It was produced by dance music producers the [[Brothers In Rhythm]], namely [[Dave Seaman]] and [[Steve Anderson (musician)]] who had previously produced [[Finer_Feelings]], her last single with [[PWL]]. Anderson remains Minogue's [[musical director]] to this day.  The lead single "[[Confide in Me]]" spent four weeks at number one on Australian singles chart.<ref>{{cite web| title = Kylie Minogue: Confide In Me (song)| publisher=Media Jungen| url = http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kylie+Minogue&titel=Confide+In+Me&cat=s| accessdate =26 July 2009}}</ref> The next two singles from the album "[[Put Yourself in My Place (Kylie Minogue song)|Put Yourself in My Place]]" and "[[Where Is the Feeling?]]" reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart,<ref name="Britishcharts"/> while the album peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart,<ref name="Britishcharts"/> eventually selling 250,000 copies.<ref>Sutherland and Ellis, p. 51</ref>

During this period, Minogue made a guest appearance as herself, in an episode of the comedy ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]''. Director [[Steven E. de Souza]] was intrigued by Minogue's cover photo in Australia's ''[[Who (magazine)|Who Magazine]]'' as one of "The 30 Most Beautiful People in the World", and offered her a role opposite [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] in the film ''[[Street Fighter (film)|Street Fighter]]''.<ref name="Smith152">Smith, p. 152</ref> The film was a moderate success, earning US$70&nbsp;million in the US,<ref name="Smith152"/> but received poor reviews with ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s Richard Harrington calling Minogue "the worst actress in the English-speaking world". She then co-starred with [[Pauly Shore]] and [[Stephen Baldwin]] in the 1996 film ''[[Bio-Dome]]''. She also appeared in the 1995 short film, ''[[Hayride to Hell]]'' and in the 1996 film ''Diana & Me''.

In 1995, Minogue collaborated with Australian artist [[Nick Cave]] for the song "[[Where the Wild Roses Grow]]".

In musical terms, Minogue has worked with many genres in [[pop music|pop]] and [[dance music]]. However, her signature or suitable music has been contemporary [[disco]] music.<!-- No such ref<ref name="aphroditereview"/>--> Her first studio album's with Stock, Aitken, and Waterman present a more bubblegum pop influence where many critics had compared her to American recording artist [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

AllMusic.</ref> At the time of her third studio album, "She began to trade in her cutesy, bubblegum pop image for a more mature one, and in turn, a more sexual one." Chris True stated that when she had her relationship with [[Michael Hutchence]], "her shedding of the near-virginal fa<U+00E7>ade that dominated her first two albums, began to have an effect, not only on how the press and her fans treated her, but in the evolution of her music."<ref name="allmusicbio">[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093 Kylie Minogue >> Overview].

However, Minogue's work on her sixth studio album ''[[Impossible Princess]]'', her songwriting and musical content started to change.

Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not "paid her dues" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on ''Neighbours''.<ref name=Shuker164/> Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, "if you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go."<ref name="ThinWhiteDame"/>

In 1993, [[Baz Luhrmann]] introduced Minogue to the photographer [[Bert Stern]], notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism.<ref>Baker and Minogue, p. 50</ref> During her career Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new "look" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' to the more traditionally sophisticated ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', making the Minogue face and name known to a broad group of people. Stylist [[William Baker (fashion designer)|William Baker]] has suggested that this is part of the reason she has entered in the mainstream [[pop culture]] of Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.<ref name="lalala165">Baker and Minogue, p. 165</ref>
