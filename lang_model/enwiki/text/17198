[[Image:The Whiskers.jpg|thumb|350px|The Whiskers, the stars of ''Meerkat Manor''. Flower, the dominant female for the first three series is the meerkat wearing a tracking collar around her neck.]]
This is a '''list of the major meerkats''' featured in the [[United Kingdom|British]] documentary [[television]] series '''''[[Meerkat Manor]]''''' produced by Oxford Scientific Films for [[Animal Planet|Animal Planet International]].  The series documents the antics of [[meerkat]]s being studied by the [[Kalahari Meerkat Project]]. The meerkats live in [[matriarchal]] groups lead by a dominant couple, who have exclusive mating and breeding rights.  The remainder of the group is usually comprised of the offspring and relatives of the dominant couple.

In the first three series, five major groups of meerkats were regularly shown, however the show's primary focus is on a group called the [[#Whiskers|Whiskers]], one of the largest and oldest of the research groups.  Other groups featured are neighbouring rival groups of the Whiskers, or groups that were formed by former Whiskers members. During the first series, a group called the [[#Lazuli|Lazuli]] are the main ones shown as the Whisker rivals, with occasional appearances by the smaller [[#Minor groups|Gattaca]] group.  In the second series, a group called the [[#Commandoes|Commandoes]] were introduced as one of the toughest rivals the Whiskers had ever faced. In the third series, the Whiskers, having been forced to move by the Commandoes, acquired two new neighbouring groups, the [[#Zappa|Zappa]], with whom they would have frequent confrontations, and the short-lived [[#Starsky|Starsky]] that was formed by a trio of evicted Whiskers females. 

The meerkat families and individuals are listed in order of appearance with the official names and spellings from the original broadcast of the series used for their primary identification.  Differences in the American or Australian broadcasts are noted as necessary, and meerkats which only appear in one or two episodes, are unnamed, or otherwise have no significance in the overall series are not included.  

<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: Please check list carefully before adding any meerkats to prevent double-listing. Please do not list meerkats with no name, that only appear in a few episodes, or that are not notable.  If you are not sure if a meerkat meets the notability requirements, ask on the talk page.  Please make sure to follow the format established below of: meerkat name as a level three header, followed by a description in past tense for dead meerkats, or present tense for those still alive.  Anything added MUST be properly cited, either from episodes or from sources that meet the Wikipedia reliability guidelines.  Any unsourced additions will be removed.

'''Dominant female:''' Rocket Dog<br />
'''Dominant male:'''  Zaphod

The Whiskers, the "stars" of ''Meerkat Manor'', formed in 1998 and are one of the oldest meerkat groups among the Kalahari Meerkat Project. Having swelled to fifty members at one point, they are considered one of the area's most successful meerkat groups.<ref name="CurrentGroups" /> Researchers selected the Whiskers as the show's primary group because they were well-established, with the individual meerkats and their personalities well known among the researchers to help the film crew with easier identification.<ref name="KMPFAQ" /> The Whiskers have been a part of the show since the first episode, at which point they controlled a {{convert|3|sqmi}} [[Territory (animal)|territory]] that contained over fifty burrows and [[bolt holes]].<ref name="CurrentGroups">{{cite web |title=Current Groups |publisher=Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project |date=2007-11-20 |url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/index.php?id=meerkat-groups0 |accessdate=2007-12-10 }}</ref><ref name="Ep1.1" /> During the series, the Whiskers experienced multiple "burrow moves" during which the entire family would shift from using one burrow to another, with adults carrying any pups too young to safely make the journey to the new burrow. Flower, their leader, assumed the role of dominant female of the group in 2002.  Between the second and third series, the Whiskers lost their territory to their rivals, the [[#Commandoes|Commandoes]], and were forced to move to a new location.<ref name="Ep3.1" /> Throughout the third series, they managed to increase the size of their new land by taking over territory from their smaller neighbours the [[#Zappa|Zappa]].<ref name="Ep3.2" /> Despite losing several adults and pups to death throughout the first three series, the Whiskers grew from having twenty-nine members in the first episode to forty in the last episode of series three.<ref name="Ep1.1" /><ref name="Ep3.13" />  Towards the end of the third series, Flower died, making her daughter Rocket Dog the group's dominant female.

In addition to ''Meerkat Manor'', the Whiskers are the focus of the 2007 book by Professor Tim Clutton-Brock entitled ''Meerkat Manor: The Story of Flower of the Kalahari'', and will be the central focus of the upcoming ''Meerkat Manor'' feature film ''Flower: Queen of the Kalahari''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Meerkat Manor - The Story of Flower of the Kalahari |last=Clutton-Brock |first=Tim |year=2007 |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location=London |isbn=0-297-84484-9 }}</ref> Both media including extensive information and coverage of the Whiskers' lives before ''Meerkat Manor'' started, including showing Flower's early life and her rise to leader.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/27/AR2007072700731_pf.html | title=March of the Cuddly-Wuddly Documentaries | first=Desson | last=Thomson | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=[[2007-07-29]] | accessdate=2007-07-29 }}</ref>

===Flower===
Born in 2000, Flower became the fearless and formidable leader of the Whiskers in 2002.<ref name="Obit" /><ref name="APLiveChat">{{cite web |title=Transcript from September 28's Live Chat with Mick Kaczorowski the senior executive producer of the US version of ''Meerkat Manor'' |publisher=Discovery Channel | work=Meerkat Manor Fan Site |url=http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/meerkat/flower/transcript.html |accessdate=2007-12-10 }}</ref> During the course of the series, Flower gave birth to numerous litters of pups, and is believed to have delivered seventy pups over the course of her lifetime.<ref name="APLiveChat" /> As the dominant female, Flower had the right to kill any pups born to other females in the group, but she did not exercise that right when her daughters Tosca and Mozart had pups at the same time early in the first series.<ref name="Ep1.3" />  Seven weeks after the pups were born, however, she evicted both daughters and forced them to leave their pups behind.<ref name="Ep1.5" /><ref name="Ep1.6" />  Flower allowed Mozart back into the group, but evicted her permanently after two more temporary evictions during the first and second series.<ref name="Ep2.5" />  Twice, Flower initiated [[burrow]] moves that would force a female who had given birth to choose between their new pups or their family.  Flower's daughter Daisy left her pups to die and rejoined her family, while Mozart accepted eviction and being alone to stay with her pups.<ref name="Ep1.9" /><ref name="Ep2.13" /> 

Though Flower was known for ruling with an "iron paw",<ref name="Obit" /> She was a devoted mother, affectionate with her family, and gentle with pups including her daughters.<ref name="Obit">{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/meerkat/flower/obituary.html |title=Gone But Not Forgotten |accessdate=2008-01-29 |publisher=Animal Planet }}</ref><ref name="Ep1.3" /> When her young pups were lost in Zappa territory early in the third series, Flower risked a war with their neighbours to find them.<ref name="Ep3.2" /> She also accepted Axle, an abandoned pup from the rivalling Zappa, into the Whiskers clan, where normally he would have been killed on sight.<ref name="Ep3.8" /> Flower's five-year reign ended late in the third series when she died after being bitten in the face by a [[Cape Cobra]] while protecting a litter of newborn pups.<ref name="Ep3.8" />

Flower's death caused a backlash against the ''Meerkat Manor'' producers, with fans wondering why the film crew and researchers did not attempt to save the meerkat.<ref name="KMPFAQ" /><ref name="NewYorkTimes" />  The producers and researchers argued that doing so would violate the agreement under which ''Meerkat Manor'' was filmed, and that the primary purpose of the Kalahari Meerkat Project is to study "...the breeding success and survival of individuals and ... the factors that effect reproduction and survival."<ref name="KMPFAQ" /> As such, interfering in the natural processes would render the research results invalid; the purpose of the show is to truly present a realistic view into the meerkats lives including their deaths.<ref name="KMPFAQ" />  After the announcement of Flower's death, the news wire service [[United Press International]] released a obituary-like news story, while fans eulogised the late meerkat in letters, poems, memorial videos on [[YouTube]], and numerous postings to fan sites and fan web forums.<ref name="NewYorkTimes">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/arts/television/10bell.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |title='The Desert Has Lost Its Favorite Rose': Death Comes to the Whiskers Family |accessdate=2007-10-28 |last=Bellafante |first=Ginia |authorlink=Ginia Bellafante |date=2007-10-11 |publisher=The New York Times }}</ref> The US Animal Planet web site added a memorial section to their ''Meerkat Manor'' site, offering visitors a copy of Flower's obituary, a video tribute, information about the upcoming film, and access to a discussion board and a live chat with the US producer of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/meerkat/flower/flower.html |title=In Memory of Flower |accessdate=2008-01-29 |publisher=Animal Planet }}</ref>

===Zaphod===
Zaphod, named after [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] from the ''[[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', was Flower's devoted partner and the dominant male of the Whiskers.<ref name="Ep1.1" /><ref name="KMPFAQ" /> As Zaphod assumed both roles by usurping his younger brother, Yossarian, he tends to be edgy if Yossarian gets too close to Flower.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news | url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/arts/television/29meer.html | author=Virginia Heffernan | publisher=[[NY Times]] | date=2006-09-29 | title=Meerkat Manor- Television - Review | accessdate=2008-01-09 }}</ref><ref name="Ep1.3" />  Being one of the largest meerkats in the group earned him the description of a "[[bruiser]]", ready and willing to lead the charge against any Whiskers rivals, or rival males trying to get too close to any of the Whiskers females.<ref name="APMeet">{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/meerkat/meet/whiskers.html |title=Meet the Meerkats | publisher=Animal Planet | accessdate=2008-01-09 |format=Flash }}</ref> After Flower's death in the third series, Zaphod continued to perform the duties as the group's dominant male and would chase off any roving males trying to reach new dominant female Rocket Dog.  But as meerkats will not mate with first generation relatives, he eventually left the group and became a roving male.<ref name="Ep3.10">{{cite episode |title=Farewell My Lovely |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.10 }}</ref>  He returned after two episodes and still acted as the group's dominant male as of the end of series three.<ref name="Ep3.12">{{cite episode |title=The Graduate |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.12 }}</ref>

===Yossarian===
Zaphod's younger brother, Yossarian is named after the main character in ''[[Catch 22]]'' and has a [[scar]] across his left eye, possibly from when he was dropped on his head by a bird of prey as a pup. Yossarian was once Flower's mate and the dominant male of the Whiskers, but Zaphod dethroned him before the series started.<ref name="Ep1.3" />  Noted as having "some social problems"<ref name="Ep1.3" /> and being a trouble-maker, Yossarian initiated two burrow moves while babysitting twice in the first series, but both were badly handled.<ref name="Ep1.3">{{cite episode |title=Some Like It Hot |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.3 }}</ref> The first attempt resulted in a lot of confusion amongst the babysitters, resulting in the eight newborn pups Yossarian dragged out of the burrow being partially trampled and almost left to die in the desert sun.<ref name="Ep1.3" /> One of the other babysitters was able to restore order and get the pups to the burrow. A few days later he tried again.  This time the babysitters joined him, but as they carried the newborn pups to a new burrow, they passed the main group and Flower and Zaphod ran after them. To avoid Flower's wrath, Yossarian dropped the pup of Mozart that he was carrying and slunk off. The pup died as a result and the rest of the Whiskers temporarily ostracised Yossarian for the havoc wrought by these moves.<ref name="Ep1.4">{{cite episode |title=Revolution |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.4 }}</ref> Yossarian's attempt to help Daisy by carrying her newborn pups to the Whiskers burrow separated him from the family.<ref name="Ep1.9">{{cite episode |title=Daisy's Choice |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.9 }}</ref> He also rescued one of Flower's pups in the second series after the young pup had wandered too far from the safety of the burrow.<ref name="Ep2.10" />

During the second series, Yossarian began a more concerted effort at finding a mate of his own, and possibly taking over leadership in another group. He made three unsuccessful attempts to reach Cazanna, the dominant female of the [[#Lazuli|Lazuli]], after the death of her mate Big Si.<ref name="Ep2.1" /><ref name="Ep2.2">{{cite episode |title=The Three Amigos |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.2 }}</ref><ref name="Ep2.8">{{cite episode |title=The Enemy Within |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.8 }}</ref> Nevertheless, he was able to successfully mate with evicted Lazuli female Pancake.<ref name="Ep2.1" /> Late in the second series, Yossarian left the Whiskers to become a full-time roving male.<ref name="Ep3.4">{{cite episode |title=The Death of Romance |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.4 }}</ref>  He has not appeared in the series since.

===Shakespeare===
Shakespeare, named after the famous [[William Shakespeare|playwright]], was one of Flower's sons.<ref name="KMPFAQ" />  Billed as "courageous" in the opening sequence of series one, he was bitten in the lower jaw and in the thigh by a [[puff adder]] in the first episode.<ref name="Ep1.1">{{cite episode |title=A Family Affair |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.1 }}</ref>  He recovered, however, and continued to be a strong contributer to the Whiskers group.<ref name="KMPFAQ">{{cite web| title=KMP meerkats FAQ | date=[[2007-11-11]] |publisher=Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project |url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/index.php?id=faq_kmp-meerkats | accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> Near the end of series one, he was the lone babysitter protecting Flower's most recent pups when the Lazuli group found the burrow, and  Shakespeare put himself between the pups and Big Si, the Lazuli's dominant male at the time.<ref name="Ep1.12">{{cite episode |title=The Calm Before the Storm |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.12 }}</ref>  When the Whiskers returned and dispatched the Lazuli, the pups were alive but Shakespeare could not be found.<ref name="Ep1.13">{{cite episode |title=Moving On |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.13 }}</ref>  

At the start of series two, Shakespeare was still missing and believed dead.<ref name="Ep2.1" /> Thomas Flower of the Kalahari Meerkat Project explained the lack of certainty by noting that "...meerkats are often killed defending pups, Shakespeare was a babysitter the day before and Lazuli were in the area. However it is equally possible that he was killed by a predator, dispersed to another group, or was killed by another group whilst trying to join them, we just weren't there on that particular day."<ref>{{cite news| title=Ask the Reality TV Expert: Alas, poor Shakespeare on Meerkat Manor | first=Andy | last=Denhart | date=[[2006-11-01]] | year=2006 | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15392433/ | accessdate=2007-10-17}}</ref> More recent articles discussing Flower's death refer to Shakespeare's death and reiterate that his body has never been found.<ref>{{cite news| title=Meerkats Mourning Lady of the Manor | first=Natalie | last=Finn | date=2007-09-28 | publisher=[E!] |work=E!

===Tosca===
Tosca was one of Flower's oldest daughters, described as "rebellious" in the first series opening sequence.<ref name="Ep1.1" /> Her research name, given to her by the Kalahari Meerkat Project researchers, is actually Baddiel.<ref name="KMPFAQ" /> In the first episode, Tosca showed signs of pregnancy.<ref name="Ep1.1" /> When the pups were born two episodes later, Flower declined to exercise her right to kill them and allowed them to be accepted into the family.<ref name="Ep1.2" />  Three episodes later, while the pups were only seven weeks old, Flower evicted Tosca from the Whiskers, forcing the new mother to leave her pups behind.<ref name="Ep1.6">{{cite episode |title=Boys Will Be Boys |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.6}}</ref> When the Whiskers were temporarily split into two groups in the next episode, Tosca found the Splinters group and took over leadership from her sister Daisy. Believing the split would be permanent, Tosca was then fitted with a radio collar by the project researchers.<ref name="Ep1.7" /> However, the two groups reunited, and after Flower resumed her role as dominate female of the group, she permanently and viciously evicted Tosca.<ref name="Ep1.8">{{cite episode |title=The Good, The Bad, And The Desperate |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.8}}</ref>

Tosca's attempts to rejoin the Whiskers after the separation from her mother were fiercely rebuffed.<ref name="Ep1.10">{{cite episode |title=Flower Power |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.10}}</ref> Tosca mated with roving male Carlos in the last episode of the first series, but he left her alone and made no motions to work on starting a new group with her.<ref name="Ep1.13">{{cite episode |title=Moving On |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.13}}</ref>  When the show returned for the second series, Tosca was missing. She is believed to have died during the harsh winter.<ref name="Ep2.1" />

===Daisy===
Daisy is another of Flower's daughters and the first to be impregnated by roving Lazuli male Carlos.<ref name="Ep1.2" /> When the Whiskers were temporarily split into two groups after a [[goshawk]] attack in the middle of the series, Daisy assumed the role of dominant female of the splinter group, but lost the role when her evicted sister Tosca found the group and took control.<ref name="Ep1.7">{{cite episode |title=Divided Loyalties |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=7 }}</ref><ref name="Ep1.8" /> When the splinter group rejoined the main Whiskers, Flower discovered Daisy's pregnancy but allowed her to remain in the group.<ref name="Ep1.8" /> Daisy gave birth in an empty burrow, and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real burrow.  The next day, Flower initiated a burrow move.  In order to remain with her family, Daisy left the pups behind to die in the abandoned burrow.<ref name="Ep1.9" />

In a very rare event in meerkat society, Daisy was evicted from the Whiskers by her sister Mozart late in the second series. After Flower reasserted her dominance over the group, Flower allowed Daisy to return and permanently evicted Mozart.<ref name="Ep2.10" /> Daisy was the babysitter on duty during both a Commandoes attack on the burrow at the end of the second series, and a Zappa attack early in the third.  In both cases, she was able to successfully protect the pups until the remaining Whiskers could return to help.<ref name="Ep2.13" /><ref name="Ep3.3" />  Daisy was impregnated by a roving Zappa male early in the third series, but new dominant female Rocket Dog did not evict her.<ref name="Ep3.5" /> Daisy successfully gave birth to the litter in the last episode of the series.<ref name="Ep3.13" />

===Mitch===
When the series first started, three-week old Mitch was taken from the burrow by his teenage siblings as a game, and then abandoned in the desert.  His brother Shakespeare found him and safely returned him to the family.<ref name="Ep1.1" />  Later, he almost died after stealing a poisonous insect from one of the adults and eating it.<ref name="Ep1.6" /> As he grew into adulthood over the second and third series, Mitch was given the "hero" label once applied to the late Shakespeare.  When Mitch was lost in Zappa territory with Sophie, Jogu, and three of Flower's pups early in the third series, he attempted to find the Whiskers group on his own so he could lead them back to the pups.<ref name="Ep3.2" />  

In the middle of the third series, he tried to help Flower's two pups, Ren and Stumpy, who were being neglected by the temporary Splinters group being lead by Rocket Dog.<ref>Note: in the US broadcast, Ren and Stumpy's names are changed to Len and Squiggy, respectively.</ref> However, Ren was killed by a bird-of-prey, and Mitch was eventually forced to abandon Stumpy and rejoin the family.<ref name="Ep3.5">{{cite episode |title=Tale of Ren and Stumpy |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.5}}</ref> Late in the series, Mitch found Axle, a pup abandoned during a failed raid attempt by the Zappa, and took him back to the Whiskers where &ndash; in an unexpected event within meerkat society &ndash; he was adopted into the family.<ref name="Ep3.8" />

===Rocket Dog===
Rocket Dog is one of Flower's many daughters and would later became the dominant female of the Whiskers group.<ref name="Ep3.8">{{cite episode |title=Journey's End |series=Meerkat Manor |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |season=3 |number=3.8}}</ref>  When the Whiskers group temporarily split into two groups during a drought and food shortage in the third series, Rocket Dog assumed the leadership of the splinter group.<ref name="Ep3.5" /> She mated with a roving Zappa male in the middle of the third series,<ref name="Ep3.5" /> but her pups died in a premature birth caused by the strain of her new-found leadership.<ref name="Ep3.7" /> When the splinter group was reunited with the Whiskers, Rocket Dog returned to being a subordinate female under her mother without any fuss.<ref name="Ep3.7" /> After Flower's death near the end of the series, Rocket Dog permanently assumed leadership of the entire Whiskers group, and moved the group to a new burrow.<ref name="Ep3.9" /> Wilson, a roving male from the Commandoes, attempted to mate with Rocket Dog, but was chased off by Zaphod, Flower's former partner and still dominant male.<ref name="Ep3.12" />  In the last episode of the third series, Maybelline rebelled against her sister's rule, but Rocket Dog was able to maintain leadership, causing Maybelline to leave the Whiskers and start her own group.<ref name="Ep3.13" />

===Axle===
Born in the third series, male pup Axle was abandoned by the Zappa during one of their unsuccessful attacks on the Whiskers burrow.  Mitch found the pup and rather than kill the pup as one would normally expect, the Whiskers adopted him into the family.<ref name="Ep3.8" /> As he adjusted to his new family, Axle tended to follow Mitch around. Although the narration refers to Axle as a Zappa pup, the research number he was assigned by the Kalahari Meerkat Project indicates that he is actually from the research group the Young Ones, which is often used to film Zappa footage.<ref name="ListOfNames">{{cite web |url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/fileadmin/files/LH_reports/List_Meerkat_names_2007.pdf |publisher=Kalahari Meerkat Project |title=List of Meerkat names, ID codes and birth dates - Year 2007 |format=pdf |accessdate=2008-01-18 }}</ref> Axle, along with his sister Rose, appear to have been named after the [[Guns 'n Roses]] front man [[Axl Rose]].<ref name="KMPFAQ" />

===Maybelline===
<!-- when series 4 starts, Maybelline will be moved to a new table for Aztecs along with any notable Whiskers that stayed with her, once we see if MM will include the Aztecs in Series 4 and/or change any names -->
Rocket Dog's sister, Maybelline, is one of three Whiskers females to get pregnated by roving Zappa males while they are part of a temporarily splinter group lead by Rocket Dog.<ref name="Ep3.5" /> Maybelline gave birth just before Flower's death, and as Flower had no litter of her own at the time, the Kalahari Meerkat Project believes it was Maybelline's newborn pups that Flower was protecting when she was killed by a snake.<ref name="Ep3.8" /><ref name="ListOfNames" /> When Rocket Dog initiated a burrow move, Maybelline at first refused to move her young pups but later gave in.  When her pups were older, Maybelline rebelled against Rocket Dog's leadership. Unable to depose her sister, Maybelline left the Whiskers with her pups and a couple of adults at the end of the third series to form a new group, the Aztecs.<ref name="Ep3.8" />

==Lazuli==
'''Dominant female:''' Cazanna<br />
'''Dominant male:''' JD

Formed in 1995, the Lazuli group is three years older than the Whiskers, with whom they regularly battle for territory. Before appearing on ''Meerkat Manor'', the Lazuli were the focus of a thirty-minute 2001 [[National Geographic]] special television title ''Walking with Meerkats: Meerkat Madness''.<ref name="CurrentGroups" />  This programme, produced by [[Big Wave TV]], documented the daily life of the Lazuli under the leadership of the group's first dominant couple, Bulgarian and Zyzyphus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigwavetv.com/productions.html |publisher=Big Wave |title=productions |accessdate=2008-01-20}}</ref>  Led by dominant male Big Si, the Lazulis had their first ''Meerkat Manor'' appearance in the second episode, where they lost their first fight with the Whiskers. This appearance also set a trend of Lazuli males seeking out Whiskers females, with the roving male Carlos being the first, and most frequent, visitor.<ref name="Ep1.2" /> In the middle of the first series, the Whiskers took over part of the Lazuli territory and later invaded a Lazuli burrow, killing the Lazuli's pups.<ref name="Ep1.5" /><ref name="Ep1.10" />

In the second series, the death of Big Si made the Lazuli less of a threat to the Whiskers. The Lazuli males continued their roving ways, with males from the group regularly visiting Whiskers females. Some of the Whiskers male followed suit and attempted to make with Cazanna and take Big Si's place.<ref name="Ep2.1" /><ref name="Ep2.2" /><ref name="Ep2.8" /> The Lazuli faced new competition with the arrival of the Commandoes, who introduced themselves by invading a Lazuli burrow, killing a pup, and wounding the babysitter.<ref name="Ep2.3" /> In the third series, the Lazuli are barely seen or mentioned, except for the occasional visit to the Whiskers burrow by a roving male from the group.

It is unknown as to whether ''Meerkat Manor'' will continue to mention the Lazuli in the fourth series.  Between the filming of the third and forth series, however, the dominant female Cazanna died of disease, leaving the group under the leadership of one of her daughters.  As Cazanna's son JD was already the dominant male, it leaves the group with a dominant couple that can not mate with one another.<ref name="CurrentGroups" />

===Big Si===
First introduced as "the biggest, meanest meerkat in the territory", Big Si was the dominant male of the Lazuli who regularly lead the various war parties against the Whiskers.<ref name="Ep1.7" />  At the end of the first series, Big Si lead the attack against a Whiskers burrow where Shakespeare was the sole babysitter on duty.  Though the Lazuli were forced to flee before they could kill the pups, the series producers and the project researchers believe Big Si killed Shakespeare during this attack, as Shakespeare was last seen putting himself between Big Si and the pups to protect them.<ref name="Ep1.12" /><ref name="Ep1.13" />  Between the first and second series, Big Si contracted [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Ep2.1">{{cite episode |title=Cold Comfort |series=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.1}}</ref> While the researchers and camera crew normally do not interfere with the lives, or deaths, of the meerkats, they had to [[Animal euthanasia|euthanise]] Big Si in order to prevent an outbreak that would have been devastating to the both the meerkat populations and the local livestock.<ref name="APLiveChat" />

===Cazanna===
At the time the Lazuli first appeared in ''Meerkat Manor'', Cazanna was the dominant female of the group. After the death of her partner Big Si between the first and second series, her son JD took over as dominant male. Without a dominant male she could mate with, Yossarian and various other roving males from the Whiskers made valiant attempts to mate with her, but none were successfully, due to the diligent protection of her son and the other Lazuli males.<ref name="Ep2.1" /><ref name="Ep2.2" /> Cazanna evicted her daughter Pancake, who was pregnant by Yossarian, but Cazanna allowed her to rejoin the family.<ref name="Ep2.3">{{cite episode |title=Young Blood |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.3 }}</ref>  After filming for series three concluded, Cazanna died from disease and her daughter assumed the leadership of the group.<ref name="CurrentGroups" />

===JD===
JD is the son of Cazanna and Big Si.  After his father's death between the first and second series, JD assumed the position of dominant male and handled chasing off roving males and leading fights.  He could not, however, mate with his mother, leaving his leadership in peril from any roving male that can win Cazanna's acceptance.<ref name="Ep2.1" /> After Cazanna's death between after the filming of the third series, JD's position remains insecure as the new dominant female is one of his sisters.<ref name="CurrentGroups" />

==Commandoes==
'''Dominant female:''' Nikita<br />
'''Dominant male:''' Hannibal

Early in the second series of ''Meerkat Manor'', a new group named the Commandoes infiltrated one of the Lazuli burrows and killed a pup.<ref name="Ep2.3" />  Led by the tough dominant pair Nikita and Hannibal, this twenty-four member-strong gang quickly became one of the Whiskers most dangerous rivals.  Their size enabled them to stand up to the Whiskers where smaller rivals, such as the Lazuli, could not.  Between the second and third series, the Commandoes defeated the Whiskers in a fight and took over the Whiskers former territory.<ref name="Ep3.1" /><ref name="Ep2.7" />

Though the Commandoes group had lost some of their adults through disease by the start of the third series, they remained formidable opponents.<ref name="CurrentGroups" /> With their shift in territories, the Whiskers' only major altercation with the Commandoes came when a drought sent the Whiskers back to their old territory in desperation for water. The Whiskers were chased off, and the Commandoes held on to their new territory.<ref name="Ep3.7">{{cite episode |title=Heavy the Crown |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.7 }}</ref>  On the other hand, their border neighbours of smaller sizes, the Zappa and Starsky groups, are easy targets for the Commandoes. When the Starsky sisters risked entering their territory in search of food and mates, the Commandoes attacked the trio and possibly killed De la Soul, who has not been seen again after the other two escaped.<ref name="Ep3.12" />

Though there is a research group named the Commandos, the Commandoes group depicted in ''Meerkat Manor'' features the dominant couple and story of the Vivian research group, with only mob scenes of the Commandoes using footage of the real Commandos group.<ref name="KalahariFP">{{Citation | title=Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project: Friends packages | date=2007-10-14 | url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/index.php?id=105 | accessdate=2007-10-15}}</ref>  In the US broadcast of the series, the Commandoes' name is changed to the American spelling of Commandos, which is also the spelling used for the real Commandos group.<ref name="APMeet" /><ref name="KalahariFP" />

===Hannibal===
The one-eyed Hannibal is a "just plain mean bully no one wants to see,"<ref name="Ep3.1" /> and rivals Zaphod as one of the largest meerkats in the Kalahari.<ref name="Ep3.1" /><ref name="APMeet" />  As dominant male of the Commandoes, Hannibal is a force to be reckoned with, showing no hesitation in confronting rival groups of meerkats.<ref name="APMeet" /> In addition to leading multiple attacks against the Whiskers, Lazuli, and Zappa, Hannibal is responsible for giving Carlos a face wound that would eventually kill him.<ref name="Ep3.4" />

===Nikita===
The dominant female of the Commandoes, Nikita is as tough as her partner, and can be just as vicious.<ref name="APMeet" /> During the raid on the Lazuli burrow, Nikita aided in the killing of a Lazuli pup.<ref name="Ep2.3" /> She also led the group in the killing of Mozart's newborn pups in the last episode of the second series, after Mozart had been permanently evicted from the Whiskers.<ref name="Ep2.13" />

===Wilson===
Wilson, a son of Hannibal and Nikita, is a roving male who attempts to mates with females from various other ''Meerkat Manor'' groups throughout the third series.  He visited the Zappa burrows without success, and later tried to mate with new Whiskers dominant female Rocket Dog before Zaphod chased him off.<ref name="Ep3.10" /><ref name="Ep3.11" /> Towards the end of the series, Wilson met Mozart, the last surviving member of the Starsky group.  When an approaching [[brush fire]] separated them, he went back to her burrow in the morning only to find her dead from a predator attack.<ref name="Ep3.12" />

==Zappa==
'''Dominant female:''' Punk<br />
'''Dominant male:''' Houdini

Named after musician [[Frank Zappa]], the Zappa group formed in 2001, but did not appear in ''Meerkat Manor'' until the third series when the Whiskers became their new neighbours.<ref name="CurrentGroups" /><ref name="KMPFAQ" /><ref name="Ep3.1" /> Billed in the opening credits as "the neighbours from hell," the fourteen-members-strong Zappa have multiple run-ins with the Whiskers throughout the series.<ref name="APMeet" />  Lead by dominant pair Lola and Frank, the Zappa have a quick fight with the Whiskers in the first episode of the third series, but are forced to flee from the much larger group.<ref name="Ep3.1">{{cite episode |title=On Dangerous Ground |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.1 }}</ref> When the Whiskers invaded the Zappa territory in search of Flower's missing pups, they ended up confiscating a Zappa burrow, claiming the part of the land as their territory.<ref name="Ep3.2" />  The Zappa repeatedly tried to retake the stolen burrow, but all attempts ended in failure.<ref name="Ep3.8" /><ref name="Ep3.3" /> In the middle of the series, while Lola was recovering from an injury, her sister Punk took over as dominant female.  The same day, Frank was disposed by Houdini and forced out of the group.<ref name="Ep3.6">{{cite episode |title=The House of Zappa |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.6 }}</ref> Punk proved to be a greater risk taker than Lola, and again lead the Zappa in a futile attack against the Whiskers.<ref name="Ep3.8" /><ref name="APMeet" /> After Flower's death, the Zappa tried to commandeer a burrow that the Whiskers had just moved in, but the Zappa were again defeated and chased off.<ref name="Ep3.9">{{cite episode |title=A New Day |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.9 }}</ref>

While there is a group named the "Zappa" within the Kalahari Meerkat Project, the Zappa shown in ''Meerkat Manor'' are primarily filmed using footage from a second research group called the Young Ones.<ref name="KalahariFP" /> However, scenes of the dominant couple are from the real Zappa group, as are the stories told about group as a whole.<ref name="CurrentGroups" />

===Lola===
Lola, the dominant female of the Zappa at the beginning of the third series, regularly commandeered food from her subordinates.<ref name="APMeet" /><ref name="Ep3.6" /> Lola disappeared from the group for two days after being bitten by a [[puff adder]].  After she struggled to make her way home, her younger sister Punk took advantage of her weakened state and took over as dominant female.<ref name="Ep3.6" />  Though Lola recovered from the snake bite, she continued to accept Punk as the new leader. When the Zappa later ran from a confrontation with the Whiskers, Lola left behind a pup she was carrying, Axle, who was adopted by the Whiskers.<ref name="Ep3.8" /> Zaphod once visited the Zappa burrow and almost mated with Lola, but was chased off by Houdini.<ref name="Ep3.10" /> Lola was instrumental in defending Punk's newborn pups during an attack by the newly formed Aztec group.<ref name="Ep3.13" />

In the sixth episode of the third series, ''Meerkat Manor'' indicates that Lola has been the leader of the Zappa for three years. However, the Kalahari Meerkat Project records show that she was born in March 2005.  This would make the narration inaccurate, as the third season was filmed between November 2006 through April 2007.<ref name="APLiveChat" /><ref name="ListOfNames" />

===Frank===
Like the Zappa group, Frank was named after [[Frank Zappa]].<ref name="KMPFAQ" />  Frank, an older male, was a formidable leader who showed no fear of leading his much smaller group against the Whiskers massive mob.<ref name="APMeet" /><ref name="Ep3.3" /> After Punk took over the group, Houdini returned from a roving trip and challenged Frank for dominance in a vicious fight.  Unable to defeat the younger meerkat, Frank was deposed and forced into exile.<ref name="Ep3.6" />  He has not been seen in the series since.

===Punk===
Punk is Lola's littermate, and the current dominant female of the group as of the end of the third series.<ref name="ListOfNames" /> More aggressive than her sister, Punk grew increasing rebellious under Lola's leadership.  When Lola was weakened by a snake bite, Punk took over as dominant female. Later that day, when Houdini returned to the group and defeated dominant male Frank, Punk quickly accepted him as her new partner.<ref name="Ep3.6" />

During the third series, Punk regularly led the Zappa into grab-and-go foraging runs into the Whiskers territory, but the smaller size of the group forced them to flee from direct confrontations.<ref name="Ep3.8" /> Towards the end of the series, a pregnant Punk started stealing food form her subordinates just as her sister once did.<ref name="Ep3.10" />  The Zappa came under attack from the newly formed Aztec group in the last episode of the series, but were able to escape.  Punk's pups were saved through the efforts of Lola.<ref name="Ep3.13" />

===Houdini===
Named after the [[Harry Houdini|magician]], Houdini is Frank's younger brother. After Carlos settled down, Houdini took over the role of Kalahari Casanova and troublemaker. He managed to mate with Flower, the dominant female of the Whiskers, before her partner Zaphod noticed his presence and chased him off.<ref name="Ep3.4" />  He also successfully mated with Maybelline, Flower's daughter, in the middle of the third series.<ref name="Ep3.5">{{cite episode |title=Tale of Ren and Stumpy |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.5 }}</ref>  The moment he returned to the Zappa after his extended roving trip, Houdini attacked Frank and deposed him.<ref name="Ep3.6" /> Taking over as dominant male of the group, Houdini began to protect the Zappa females from the efforts of the now mate-less Zaphod and from Commandoes rover Wilson.<ref name="Ep3.10" />

==Starsky==
The Starsky was a small group of seven meerkats that formed between the filming of the second and third series.  The group first appeared in the second episode of the third series. Mozart and Kinkajou, two of three evicted Whiskers sisters in the group, competed for the position of dominant female, while Carlos, the former roving male from the Lazuli, was secure in his position as dominant male.<ref name="Ep3.2" /> The group struggled to survive from the start. They were plagued with problems, such as Carlos having a fatal face injury, keeping litters alive, and their small territory having little food.<ref name="Ep3.2" /><ref name="Ep3.3" /><ref name="LostGroups" />  After Carlos died from an infection in his wound, the remaining meerkats began dying from starvation, disease, and [[predation]]. By the eleventh episode of the third series, only the three sisters, Kinkajou, Mozart, and De la Soul, remained.  The last of the group, Mozart, was killed by a [[jackal]] in April 2007, bringing the short life of the Starsky group to an end.<ref name="Ep3.12" /><ref name="LostGroups">{{cite web | url=http://friends.kalahari-meerkats.com/index.php?id=lost_groups |publisher=Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat Project |title=Lost Groups | accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref>

===Mozart===
A daughter of Flower, Mozart was originally a member of the Whiskers group.  Referred to as "the caring" one in the first series credits, Mozart was always ready to lend a helping hand for the family.<ref name="Ep1.1" /><ref name="APMeet" />  When her littermate Shakespeare was bitten by a puff adder in the first episode, she stayed at his side and kept him company until he recovered.<ref name="Ep1.2">{{cite episode |title=Love Thy Neighbour |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.2 }}</ref>  Mozart was temporarily exiled from the Whiskers group several times for having pups.  Her first eviction came part way through the first series and lasted only one episode.<ref name="Ep1.5">{{cite episode |title=Childhood's End |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=1 |number=1.5 }}</ref><ref name="Ep1.6" />  Her second eviction in the next series was ended by her miscarrying.<ref name="Ep2.5">{{cite episode |title=There's No Place Like Home |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.5 }}</ref><ref name="Ep2.7">{{cite episode |title=United We Stand |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.7 }}</ref> Near the end of the second series, Mozart again became pregnant, and then made the unusual move of evicting her sister Daisy from the Whiskers.<ref name="Ep2.10">{{cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.10 }}</ref> Flower led the Whiskers to a new home and left Mozart alone at the burrows with her newborn pups, effectively evicting her.<ref name="Ep2.12">{{cite episode |title=The Godmother |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.12 }}</ref>  The Commandoes killed Mozart's pups in the next episode while Mozart was on the search for food.<ref name="Ep2.13">{{cite episode |title=The Killing Fields |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.13 }}</ref>

When Mozart returned in the third series, she competed with her sister Kinkajou, also evicted from the Whiskers, for leadership of a new group, the Starsky, which she had founded with roving male Carlos.<ref name="Ep3.2">{{cite episode |title=The Mission |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.2 }}</ref>  Kinkajou eventually took over as dominant female, asserting her dominance by killing Mozart's newborn pups.<ref name="Ep3.3">{{cite episode |title=Something's Gotta Give |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.3 }}</ref> Carlos' death left the Starsky females without a mate or a potential for new pups, and the remaining members of the group died. Mozart at last lost her sisters in the eleventh episode.  Shortly after, Mozart met a roving Commandoes male, Wilson, who seemed primed to help her revive the group, but Mozart was killed outside of her burrow by a [[jackal]] the next day.<ref name="Ep3.12">{{cite episode |title=The Graduate |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.12 }}</ref><ref name="LostGroups" />

Mozart's death, having come less than a month after the death of her mother, was reported in national newspapers, including the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Denver Post]]''. Saddened fans posted various [[tributes]] online, including poems, songs, and videos.<ref name="NYTimes_Death">{{cite news | title=Death Stalks the Meerkats Yet Again |publisher=[[New York Times]] | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/arts/television/27meer.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1193682159-5Debl9To+tAUiraafyy7GA | author=Joanne Ostrow | date=2007-10-24 |accessdate=2008-01-10 }}</ref><ref name="DenverPost">{{cite news | title=Death Strikes 'Meerkat Manor' Again |publisher=[[Denver Post]] | url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_7270406 | author=Edward Wyatt | date=2007-10-28 |accessdate=2008-01-10 }}</ref>

===Carlos===
Carlos, whose research name was JD, made regular appearances in the series starting with the second episode.<ref name="Ep1.2" /><ref name="LostGroups" /> A rather amorous fellow who was billed as the Kalahari's "[[Casanova]]",<ref name="APMeet" /><ref name="Ep1.13" /> he impregnated at least three Whiskers females during the first series  including Daisy, Mozart, Tosca, and Kinkajou.<ref name="Ep3.1" /><ref name="Ep1.6" /><ref name="APMeet" /><ref name="Ep1.13" /><ref name="Ep1.2" /> Despite his roving ways, the show producers referred to him as Mozart's "long-time love" due to their frequent matings.<ref name="APMeet" />

In the third series, Carlos put aside his roving ways and became the dominant male of the Starsky, with both Kinkajou and Mozart pregnant with his pups.<ref name="Ep3.2" /> Carlos' was bitten in the face during a fight with Commandoes dominant male, Hannibal. An infection set into the wound, eventually killing Carlos and leaving the Starsky without a dominant male.<ref name="Ep3.4" />

===Kinkajou===
Kinkajou was the younger half-sister of Mozart and appeared sporadically throughout the programme. In the first series, a teenage Kinkajou took her younger brother Mitch from the burrow and left him alone in the desert after she got bored with watching him.<ref name="Ep1.1" /> She became a more reliable babysitter as she grew older, but followed in her mother Flower's footsteps with an unauthorised pregnancy in the second series.<ref name="Ep2.4">{{cite episode |title=Iron Lady |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=2 |number=2.4 }}</ref> As Kinkajou was evicted between the second and third series, it remains unanswered how she was reunited with her sisters Mozart and De la Soul.<ref name="Ep3.1" /> 

At the start of the third series, Kinkajou was pregnant by Carlos and determined to become the dominant female of the group.  She started her quest for leadership by leading the group on their foraging trips and then initiating a burrow move. As a final assertion of dominance, she demonstrated her right to be the only female in the group with pups by killing Mozart's newborn pups.<ref name="Ep3.3" />  She held her position as dominant female until the group, down to only the three sisters, had a disastrous run-in with the Commandoes near the end of the series.  After fleeing for their lives, only Kinkajou and Mozart remained. They found a burrow for the night during a storm, but weakened from starvation, Kinkajou died in her sleep.<ref name="Ep3.11">{{cite episode |title=Three Degrees of Separation |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.11 }}</ref><ref name="LostGroups" />

==Minor groups==
===Gattaca===
The Gattaca, named after the [[Gattaca|1997 SciFi movie]], was a minor group of approximately ten members that appeared briefly in the first series.<ref name="LostGroups" /> The small group first appeared in episode seven when the Whiskers accidentally crossed over into their territory. The meeting ended without incident as the Whiskers willingly returned to their own land.<ref name="Ep1.7" /> Risca, a former dominant female of the Whiskers, lead the Gattaca.<ref name="LostGroups" />  Acting as minor rivals of the Whiskers, the Gattaca received little story attention until they quietly disappeared from the show before the end of the series. In reality, the group died out from disease and predation.<ref name="LostGroups" />

===Aztecs===
The Aztecs are a small group of seven adult meerkats that was formed by Maybelline in the final episode of the third series when she broke away from the Whiskers.<ref name="Ep3.13">{{cite episode |title=A Family at War |episodelink=List of Meerkat Manor episodes |series=Meerkat Manor |serieslink=Meerkat Manor |season=3 |number=3.13 }}</ref> Until the fourth series airs in 2008, it is unknown whether the Aztecs will become a major group on the programme.
