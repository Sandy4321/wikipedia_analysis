'''Lloyd Kenyon, 1st Baron Kenyon''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]], [[Serjeant-at-law|SL]], [[King's Counsel|KC]] (5 October 1732 &ndash; 4 April 1802) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] politician and [[barrister]], who served as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], [[Master of the Rolls]] and [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]]. Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in [[Hanmer]] before moving to [[Ruthin School]] aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the [[Middle Temple]] in 1750 and being [[called to the Bar]] in 1776. Initially almost unemployed due to the lack of education and contacts which a university education would have provided, his business increased thanks to his friendships with [[John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton|John Dunning]], who, overwhelmed with cases, allowed Kenyon to work many, and [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Lord Thurlow]] who secured for him the  [[Chief Justice of Chester|Chief Justiceship of Chester]] in 1780. He was returned as the [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]] the same year, serving repeatedly as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] under [[William Pitt the Younger]]. He effectively sacrificed his political career in 1784 to challenge the ballot of [[Charles James Fox]], and was rewarded with a barony; from then on he did not speak in the House of Commons, despite remaining an MP.

on 27 March 1784 he was appointed [[Master of the Rolls]], a job he dedicated himself to once he ceased to act as an MP. He had previously practised in the [[Court of Chancery]], and although unfamiliar with Roman law was highly efficient; Lord Eldon said "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all".<ref name=cam33/> On 9 June 1788, Kenyon succeeded [[Lord Mansfield]] as [[Lord Chief Justice]], and was granted a barony. Although not rated as highly as his predecessor, his work "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law".<ref name=cam29/> He remained Lord Chief Justice until his death in 1802.

==Early life and education==
Kenyon was born on 5 November 1732 in Gredington, [[Flintshire]] to Lloyd Kenyon, a country gentleman and [[Justice of the peace|Justice of the Peace]],<ref>Townsend (1846) p.33</ref> and his wife Jane Eddowes. He was initially educated at a school in [[Hanmer]] - it was written that "no man ever set out on his career with fewer advantages" than Kenyon.<ref>Phillips (1807) p.578</ref> When he was 12 he was sent to [[Ruthin School]], where he learnt French and Latin, and was considered one of the best students at the school.<ref>Kenyon (1990) p.9</ref> His knowledge of Greek was non-existent, and his scientific training minor; "he was said to have believed to his dying day that the sun goes around the earth".<ref>Campbell (2006) p.19</ref> As a second son, he had initially considered joining the clergy, but instead decided on the law and spent 5 years working as a clerk to Mr W.J. Tomkinson, an attorney.<ref>Chalmers (1815) p.328</ref> He proved to be an excellent clerk, becoming a "rapid and accurate conveyancer".<ref>Kenyon (1990) p.13</ref> Originally happy with the idea of being a simple attorney, after the death of his older brother it was instead assumed he would become a barrister, and Kenyon joined the [[Middle Temple]] in November 1750.<ref>Campbell (2006) p.21</ref> In February 1775 he left Tomkinson's practice and moved to London, where he was [[called to the Bar]] on 10 February 1776.<ref>Kenyon (1990) p.14</ref>

==Career as a barrister==
Without the education or connections that a university education would have provided he was almost entirely unemployed for several years.<ref>Phillips (1807) p.579</ref> Kenyon instead lived off an <U+00A3>80 allowance from his father, and money from his richer relatives, spending the time watching [[Lord Mansfield]] conduct cases at the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]].<ref>Kenyon (1990) p.15</ref> His early business was almost entirely [[conveyancing]], and to make extra money he began to attend the Welsh Circuit, where Tomlinson's contacts allowed him to pick up some small cases. After several years of this he also began attending quarter sessions at Oxford, Stafford and Shrewsbury, "where he was more successful".<ref>Kenyon (1990) p.19</ref> While his work slowly began to increase, his main rise was due to his friendship with [[John Dunning, 1st Baron Ashburton|John Dunning]], at the time a similarly near-unemployed barrister. In 1762 one of the leaders of the Northern Circuit died, and his work was given to Dunning; as he found himself with too many cases, he gave many to Kenyon. In 1767, for example, Kenyon dealt with 20 of Dunning's cases. As a result of his speedy and efficient work attorneys began to employ him directly, and within 10 years he was making <U+00A3>3,000 a year just from [[Legal opinion|opinions]].<ref>Kenyon (1990) p.25</ref>

Kenyon's next rise came about as a result of his introduction to the [[Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]], who was struggling with [[Sir James Lowther, 4th Baronet|James Lowther]] for the control of several Parliamentary constituencies. Kenyon went with Richmond to [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]] and [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]] as his lawyer, and secured the constituencies for Richmond; as a result, Richmond chose to employ Kenyon as his lawyer from then onwards.<ref>Kenyon (1990) p.26</ref> In 1780 he successfully defended [[Lord George Gordon]] for high treason, assisted by [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]], and the resulting fame was enough to propel him further up the ranks of his profession and within the political sphere.<ref>Chalmers (1815) p.329</ref> At the same time he became friends with [[Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow|Lord Thurlow]], and when the holder of the [[Chief Justice of Chester|Chief Justiceship of Chester]] died that year, Thurlow ensured that it was given to Kenyon.<ref>Campbell (2006) p.25</ref> The rise of Kenyon's work in the [[Court of Chancery]] was also attributed to his frienship with Thurlow, who as [[Lord Chancellor]] was the head of the Court.<ref>Phillips (1807) p.580</ref>

==Political career==
When Parliament was dissolved in 1780, Thurlow ensured that Kenyon was returned as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]].<ref>Campbell (2006) p.27</ref> In April 1780, on the formation of the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Rockingham government]], Kenyon was made [[Attorney-General for England and Wales]],<ref>Chalmers (1815) p.330</ref> despite having never sat in the lower office of [[Solicitor-General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] or spoken in Parliament.<ref>Townsend (1846) p.43</ref> As Attorney General he spoke on only one subject, on 18 June 1782, in regards to the amount of money owed to the [[Exchequer]] by the [[Paymaster General]].<ref>Campbell (2006) p.33</ref> On the death of Rockingham Kenyon continued in his post under the next administration, but after the government underwent significant changes he was replaced by [[James Wallace (MP)|James Wallace]] on 18 June 1783. He instead allied himself with [[William Pitt the Younger]], leading the opposition to the first Act of the new government and strongly supporting an opposition bill to reform the [[Exchequer]].<ref>Campbell (2006) p.36</ref> When the new government was dismissed on 19 December and Pitt took control, Kenyon was again confirmed as Attorney-General. He again took the lead on the issue of the Paymaster General, and commanded that he "do deliver to the House an account of the balance of all public money remaining in his hands on the 13th day of November last", something the Paymaster complained was against common practice.<ref>Campbell (2006) p.37</ref>

In 1784 [[Thomas Sewell]] died, and, as was tradition, Kenyon succeeded him as [[Master of the Rolls]] on 27 March.<ref>Foss (1843) p.137</ref> Initially intending to withdraw from Parliament, Kenyon was persuaded to remain as an MP and Attorney General to increase Pitt's majority. Having purchased the seat of [[Tregony (UK Parliament constituency)|Tregony]] he "was resolved to go the whole hog", and became one of the strongest and most visible supporters of Pitt. With his contacts in Wales, he secured votes for several ministerial candidates in Welsh constituencies.<ref>Campbell (2006) p.40</ref> In an attempt to have [[Charles James Fox]] removed as an MP he had Fox's ballot challenged; while this backfired,<ref>Campbell (2006) p.43</ref> he was awarded with a baronetcy for the effective sacrifice of his political career.<ref>Townsend (1846) p.48</ref> As a result of this controversy he stated that "legislation was a task to which he had by no means thought himself equal", and stayed silent in Parliament for the rest of his life.<ref>Campbell (2006) p.46</ref>

==Judicial career==
Having withdrawn from politics, Kenyon instead switched his focus to his job as [[Master of the Rolls]]. As a judge of the [[Court of Chancery]] he was required to deal with cases of [[equity (law)|equity]]; though he was almost entirely unfamiliar with the Roman law it was based on, he had previously practised in the Chancery.<ref>Campbell (2006) p.46</ref> He was not considered as good as his successor, [[William Grant (British politician)|Sir William Grant]], but Lord Eldon wrote that "I am mistaken if, after I am gone, the Chancery Records do not prove that if I have decided more than any of my predecessors in the same period of time, Sir Lloyd Kenyon beat us all". With the retirement of [[Lord Mansfield]] as [[Lord Chief Justice]], Kenyon succeeded him on 9 June 1788, and was made Baron Kenyon of Gredington, in the county of [[Flintshire|Flint]].<ref name=cam33>Campbell (2006) p.50</ref>

Kenyon's appointment was initially greeted with caution by his fellow [[barrister]]s, who worried that, as he had practised in a court of equity rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]]. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an "excess of zeal" in moral issues.<ref>Phillips (1807) p.582</ref> One of his flaws was his defective education; he was too proud to avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say "My Lord... it would be well if you would stick to your good law and leave off your bad Latin".<ref>Campbell (2006) p.58</ref> As a judge, Kenyon overruled the principles that a court of law could not consider [[English trusts law|trusts]] or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law".<ref name=cam29>Campbell (2006) p.61</ref> After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/15431?docPos=1|title=Oxford DNB article: Kenyon, Lloyd (subscription needed)|last=Hay|first=Douglas|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1773 he married his cousin, Mary Kenyon, with whom he had three sons; Lloyd, who predeceased him, [[Baron Kenyon|George]], and Thomas.<ref>Townsend (1846) p.41</ref> Kenyon was noted by [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell]] as "a man of wonderful quickness of perception, of considerable intellectual nimbleness, of much energy of purpose, and of unwearied industry",<ref>Campbell (2006) p.17</ref> although Campbell noted that, thanks to Kenyon's lack of a university education, he knew only "the corner of jurisprudence which he professionally cultivated; he had not even the information generally picked up by the clever clerk of a country attorney". He was noted as arrogant, despising things he did not understand and condemning any opinions he disagreed with regardless of his knowledge of them. He never attempted to reform the judicial system, and "his habits of sordid parsimony brought discredit on the high station which he filled".<ref>Campbell (2006) p.18</ref> Despite this, as a judge he was seen as "profound in legal erudition, patient in judicial discrimination, and of the most determined integrity".<ref>Foss (1843) p.138</ref>
