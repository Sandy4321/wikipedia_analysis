{{Campaignbox Camden Expedition}}

The '''Battle of Jenkins' Ferry''' was fought April 30, 1864, in [[Grant County, Arkansas|Grant County]], [[Arkansas]] during the [[American Civil War]]. It was the climactic battle of the [[Camden Expedition]], which was a part of the [[Union Army|Union Army<U+2019>s]] failed [[Red River Campaign]].

==Campaign leading to the battle==
===Red River campaign===
In March 1864, the [[Union Army]] in [[Louisiana]] under the command of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and the [[Union Navy]] operating on the [[Mississippi River]] under the command of [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[David Dixon Porter]] launched the [[Red River Campaign]], with the immediate objective of capturing [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport, LA]]. Shreveport was the headquarters of [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy<U+2019>s]] [[Trans-Mississippi Department]], the temporary capital of Confederate Louisiana, a major supply depot and a gateway to [[Texas]]. An incidental objective of the campaign was to purchase cotton, which was in short supply in the northern States, and thereby possibly to win the loyalty of planters along the river for the Union and to expand Confederate [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in Louisiana.<ref>McPherson, James, M., ed., ''The Atlas of the Civil War'', p. 148.

Since [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] had approved the Red River Campaign plan before [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] and General-in-Chief, Grant felt he could not stop the campaign, although he tried to hurry its execution. Grant would have preferred to use a 10,000-man force which was diverted to the campaign to reinforce [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William T. Sherman]] in his drive from north Georgia to [[Atlanta Campaign|Atlanta, GA]]. He also would have liked to have pinned down more Confederate troops in Alabama with an attack on the Confederate stronghold at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile, AL]].<ref>Foote, 1974. p. 25;  ISBN 0-394-46512-1 (v. 3).</ref>

Union Major General Banks had a force of at least 20,000 men available near [[New Orleans]] for the campaign.<ref>Foote, 1974, p.28</ref> He was to be joined by 10,000 men of Sherman's army from [[Vicksburg]], MS under the command of [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Andrew J. Smith]]. Smith's force accompanied Porter's [[flotilla]] up the [[Red River]] and initially they were successful in capturing [[Fort DeRussy]] to open passage up the Red River.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1616.</ref> Banks also was supposed to be joined by approximately 14,000 men commanded by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Frederick Steele]]. Steele's forces were to move against Shreveport from their bases at [[Little Rock]], [[Fort Smith]], and [[Pine Bluff]], AR to the north.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 28.</ref>

===Camden expedition===
====To Camden====
Steele's part in the campaign was called the [[Camden Expedition]]. Steele later said its objective was to reach and occupy [[Camden, Arkansas|Camden, AR]] and to draw Confederate [[cavalry]] away from Shreveport in support of Banks<U+2019>s effort to take the city. Nonetheless, Banks obviously planned for Steele to join him in the attempt to take Shreveport, not just to occupy Camden temporarily. In fact, even Grant sent a telegram to Steele that told him a demonstration was insufficient support of Banks.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 64.</ref> After Banks<U+2019>s forces were repulsed in their march toward Shreveport at the [[battle of Mansfield]], LA by outnumbered forces led by Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[Richard Taylor]], Banks had paused his retreat at [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria, LA]]. Still thinking he could renew the campaign, Banks communicated to Steele his desire for Steele<U+2019>s reinforcements in order to make another attempt to take Shreveport.<ref>Foote, 1974, pp. 61<U+2013>62.</ref>

Steele, with 8,000 men, first marched southwest from Little Rock to [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia, AR]] on his way to Camden, AR and presumably eventually toward Shreveport. Steele planned to meet a Union column of 4,000 men from Fort Smith, AR, led by [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[John Milton Thayer|John Thayer]] at Arkadelphia.<ref>Foote, 1974, p.65.</ref> A Federal cavalry force of about 2,000 from Pine Bluff, AR was supposed to keep watch on the Confederate garrison at Camden, divert attention from Steele<U+2019>s movement and eventually join up with Steele.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 65</ref> Even though Steele was three weeks behind schedule, he did not find Thayer at Arkadelphia when his forces arrived there on March 29, 1864. Steele<U+2019>s men had marched for the last three days in the rain on already reduced rations. The poor country along the route of the march was destitute and there was little food or forage to be had.<ref>Josephy, Jr., Alvin M., ''The Civil War in the American West'', p. 211. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York, 1991. ISBN 0-304-56482-0.</ref> After waiting until April 1, 1864, with his supplies being further depleted and no word from Thayer, Steele moved southwest toward [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington, AR]], the temporary capital of Confederate Arkansas.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 211.</ref> He eventually united with Thayer near [[Elkins' Ferry]] on the [[Little Missouri River]] on April 9, 1864. Thayer brought few supplies, however, and the combined force then found itself short of supplies.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 67.</ref>

Steele succeeded in aiding Banks only to the extent of keeping the five Confederate cavalry brigades in the region from joining the forces opposing Banks. Two Confederate infantry divisions from Arkansas and Missouri under the overall command of [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[Sterling Price]] were sent from the Camden area to support the forces opposing Banks. Under the command of [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[John S. Marmaduke]] and the overall command of Price, who remained in command in Arkansas, 3 of the 5 cavalry brigades harassed Steele's force as it moved from Arkadelphia but could not stop its slow progress. The opposing forces fought a small battles at [[Elkins' Ferry]] on the [[Little Missouri River]] on April 3, 1864, where Steele's forces stymied Marmaduke's attempt to prevent them from crossing the Little Missouri River, and at [[Battle of Prairie D'Ane|Prairie D'Ane, AR]] on April 10, 1864.<ref>McPherson, 2005, p.150-151.</ref> On April 12, Steele feinted toward Washington, where Price had moved to resist him, and sidestepped the Confederates with a move to Camden, which was out of the way for a march to Shreveport.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 211</ref> After brushing aside Marmaduke<U+2019>s cavalry 14 miles from Camden, Steele's force occupied Camden on April 15, 1864.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 69.</ref> Price had earlier evacuated that fortified town in order to defend Washington, AR.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 67.</ref>

====At Camden, Poison Spring and Marks' Mill====
Price, who had been joined by two Texas cavalry brigades under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Samuel B. Maxey]], appeared at Camden soon after Steele<U+2019>s occupation of the town. With the 7 cavalry brigades, Price besieged the entrenched Steele, even though Steele still outnumbered him.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 67-69.</ref>

Steele had hoped to be resupplied from depots at Little Rock and Pine Bluff and to collect provisions from the countryside.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 211</ref> He was denied significant resupply when Confederate cavalry forces of 1,700 troopers under Brigadier General [[John S. Marmaduke]] and 1,600 additional troopers under Brigadier General [[Samuel B. Maxey]] overwhelmed what appeared to be a successful Union foraging expedition under the command of Colonel James M. Williams before it could return to Camden.<ref>Eicher, David J., ''The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War,'' p. 653. Simon and Schuster Paperbacks, Inc., New York, 2001, first paperback edition 2006. ISBN 978-0-684-84945-4.</ref> The Confederates captured 170 wagons and teams and destroyed the rest from a 198-wagon supply train. One source stated the Confederates killed or captured "most" of its escort of 1,170 infantry and cavalry and four artillery pieces at the [[Battle of Poison Spring|battle of Poison Spring, AR]] on April 18, 1864.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 212.</ref> Another source states that the Union forces lost 301 men, mostly killed or missing.<ref>Foote, 1974, P. 70.</ref><ref>Eicher, 2001, p. 653 says Union casualties at Poison Spring were 204 killed and missing and 97 wounded, with 117 of the dead being African-Americans. He does not give a separate number of captured Union soldiers. He states that Confederate losses totaled 114.</ref> The Confederates killed some African-American soldiers in this escort as they tried to surrender according to reports from the field.<ref>Eicher, 2001, p. 653 bases this statement in part on Colonel Williams<U+2019>s report from eyewitnesses.</ref> About the time the remnants of the Union force who were not killed or captured at Poison Spring stumbled back into Camden, Steele learned that General Banks had turned back in his drive toward Shreveport after being defeated at the [[battle of Mansfield]], LA (also known as Pleasant Grove or Sabine Cross Roads), about 40 miles from Shreveport, on April 8, 1864.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 70; Faust, Patricia L., ed., ''Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War''p. 305. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., New York, NY, 1986. ISBN 0-06-181261-7.</ref>

Banks had won a tactical victory and inflicted more casualties (1,626) than his forces sustained (1,369) at the [[battle of Pleasant Hill]] the day after the battle of Mansfield. His force also outnumbered the Confederate force, but Banks thought otherwise and continued his retreat toward Alexandria, LA.<ref>McPherson, 2005, p. 148.</ref> Meanwhile, Admiral Porter had to retreat down the Red River and back toward the Mississippi River while under near constant Confederate fire from the river banks. Porter had to return not only because of Banks<U+2019>s retreat, but because his flotilla was in danger of being stranded by uncommonly low water levels in the Red River. Although the boats were freed from the Red River by May 13 through skillful engineering and damming of the river, Banks had to wait at Alexandria, LA during the time Porter's boats were bottled up in order to protect it from Confederate attack from the shore before he could move in any direction.<ref>Faust, 1986, p. 620; Foote, 1974, p. 61.</ref>

On April 23, 1864, when Steele received the dispatch from Banks asking that he join Banks so they could move again on Shreveport, Steele responded that he was in no position to join Banks. He also noted that he now faced not only Confederate cavalry but infantry under Sterling Price and additional infantry under Kirby Smith, who had joined Price with some of the infantry which had been with Taylor at Pleasant Hill. [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas J. Churchill]]<U+2019>s Arkansas division and [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Mosby Parsons]]'s Missouri division returned to Price's command, followed by [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[John G. Walker]]<U+2019>s larger Texas division with Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had decided that Steele was a bigger threat, and a bigger prize, than Banks when Banks continued to retreat after the battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, 1864.  Kirby Smith thought he could destroy Steele's force and perhaps still turn back and trap Banks later.<ref>McPherson, 2005, p. 148; Foote, 1974, pp. 53<U+2013>54.</ref> Taylor vehemently disagreed with this decision and wanted to attack Banks immediately. Nonetheless, Taylor could not convince Kirby Smith to change his plan. As Banks appeared to be waiting for the naval force at Alexandria, LA, Kirby Smith became even more certain that his decision was correct.<ref>Foote, 1974, pp. 53-54.</ref>

On April 25, 1864, in an action called the [[Battle of Marks' Mill]], two (2) Confederate cavalry brigades under the overall command of [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[James Fagan]], operating under Price, captured a foraging train of between 211 and 240 wagons and 1,300 of the escort which Steele had sent to seek supplies from Pine Bluff. Only about 150 of the 1,400 to 1,700<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 72; Faust, 1986, p. 395; Josephy, 1991, p. 213; and Eicher, 2001, p. 654 all give brief accounts of this action. They differ somewhat on the number of Federal soldiers engaged. Most of them give the 240-wagon number.</ref> Federal soldiers escaped after a five-hour fight.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 212. Eicher, 2001, p. 654 states that numerous prisoners were captured but also says Union losses were 100 killed, 250 wounded, 100 captured. Confederate losses were 41 killed, 108 wounded, 144 missing.</ref> Fagan had about 300 casualties in the engagement. Reports showed his men killed wounded African-American Union soldiers at the end of the battle, for which the Confederates in turn would pay at Jenkins' Ferry.<ref>McPherson, 2005, p. 150.</ref>

====Retreat from Camden====
Steele was now desperately short of supplies, outnumbered and in danger of being surrounded at Camden. After his senior officers agreed with him that he had no other reasonable choice, Steele ordered a night withdrawal toward Little Rock on April 26 and the early morning of April 27, 1865, which the Confederates did not detect. Steele's forces used a pontoon bridge which they had carried on the campaign to cross the [[Ouachita River]]. They gained a head start on the Confederates who pursued the Union forces as soon as they realized that Steele had withdrawn from Camden. First, the Confederates had to get across the swollen, and bridgeless, Ouachita River on the morning of April 28 by constructing a raft bridge.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1068.</ref> This delay allowed Steele to get a further head start, although rain soon slowed him down.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1068.</ref> The Confederates struggled through the rain, as well, but they did not have as many wagons or as much equipment to slow down their pursuit.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 75.</ref>

Meanwhile, on April 28, Price sent Samuel Maxey's division of two (2) cavalry brigades back to Oklahoma and Texas to attend to reported threats to that territory by another Union force.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 213.</ref> Brigadier General Fagan, who had commanded the victorious Confederate forces at Marks Mill, took off on independent operations but did not fulfill his orders which permitted this movement but stated some objectives. He failed in his first objective to destroy the Federal supply depot at Pine Bluff, probably because he could not cross the swollen Saline River. Fagan also failed to occupy a position across Steele's supply and communication lines between Camden and Little Rock, as Price had ordered, probably because he was looking for food and forage for his own force.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 213.</ref> Fagan was not in immediate communication with Price and not in a position to know Steele's recent movements but Price realized on April 29 that Fagan was not blocking the Union retreat. Fagan and his 3,000 troopers would arrive at Jenkins<U+2019> Ferry on April 30, 1865 too late to take part in the battle.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 76</ref>

Steele moved due north out of Camden by way of Princeton, AR. His force was harassed by Confederate cavalry as Marmaduke's men caught up to the Union column on their approach to the [[Saline River]]. When Steele's forces reached Jenkins' Ferry on the swollen river, they had to stop to construct their [[pontoon bridge]] again to get across. The remaining 10,000 Confederates under Kirby Smith and Price then caught up to Steele, who also had about 10,000 men remaining, and brought on a battle on April 30, 1864.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 74.</ref> Steele<U+2019>s cavalry had been able to cross the Saline overnight on April 29. Now Steele had to fight off Kirby Smith's army before his infantry forces could finish their efforts to get their wagons, artillery and remaining troops over the river crossing.<ref>Foote, 1974, pp. 73<U+2013>73.</ref>

==Battle of Jenkins' Ferry==
===Battle===
When Union [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Frederick Steele| Frederick Steele's]] forces reached Jenkins<U+2019> Ferry, AR on the Saline River at 2:00 p.m. on April 29, 1864 in their retreat from Camden, AR to their base at Little Rock, AR, the river was swollen by heavy rain. The rain continued in torrents on April 29 and the riverbank and approaches had become a quagmire of mud and standing water.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> The tired and famished Federals could not construct their pontoon bridge and get their wagons and artillery out of the mud and over the river during the night, although the Union cavalry forces did get across. Since the Federals realized that Kirby Smith's Confederate forces were rushing to catch up to them, a Union Army rear guard built breastworks and took a formidable defensive position to oppose the Confederates on the morning of April 30. With Steele continuing to supervise the river crossing, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Frederick C. Salomon|Frederick (Friedrich) C. Salomon]] should have commanded the rear guard action against the pursuing Confederates but he left the task to [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Samuel Rice]] and 4,000 of the Union infantry.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref>

Before dawn on April 30, 1864, Marmaduke<U+2019>s Confederate cavalry troopers had arrived near Jenkins<U+2019> Ferry, dismounted and were skirmishing with Steele's force about 2 miles from the river crossing.<ref>Faust. 1986, p.395.</ref> Rice had placed the Union forces behind the breastworks, [[abatis]] and rifle pits.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> Rice's lines were protected by Cox Creek, sometimes shown as Toxie Creek on the right. While some accounts have stated that the Union position was bordered by an impassable cane swamp on one side and thick, rain-drenched timber on the other,<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> other sources state that the left flank was vulnerable and after efforts to turn his left flank, Rice extended his left until it rested on a steep wooded slope.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref> The difficult approach to the Union position was only about four hundred yards wide<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> and would allow at most only 4,000 Confederate infantry to attack at one time.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 75; Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref> In the event, the Confederates attacked in an even more piecemeal manner.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref>

Price committed the infantry first under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Thomas J. Churchill]] and then under [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brigadier General]] [[Mosby M. Parsons]] to the battle as soon as they arrived. They made little headway because the Confederates had no cover for an attack and the approach to the Federal position was ankle to knee deep in mud and pools of water. These divisions were sent in piecemeal, brigade by brigade.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214; Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref>

Gunpowder smoke added to a blanket of fog soon after the battle began. This made it nearly impossible for the opposing forces to see each other except by crouching down low, which only served to help the defenders more since they were mainly lying behind their works and not attempting to get to them through the mud as were the Confederate attackers. They also could simply fire into a narrow area where the Confederates had to attack.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 75; Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> The mud and standing water prevented cavalry and artillery from participating much in the battle. In fact, the Confederates lost three artillery pieces to a charge from their fortified positions by the 2d Kansas Colored and the 29th Iowa Infantry regiments.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref>

After Price<U+2019>s forces under Brigadier Generals Churchill and Parsons had made little progress, Kirby Smith came up with the large Texas infantry division under [[Major General (CSA)|Major General]] [[John G. Walker]], who carried on the attack, again, brigade by brigade.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> All three Confederate brigade commanders were wounded in these attacks.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 75</ref> Two of them, Brigadier General [[William Read Scurry]] and Colonel [[Horace Randal]] were mortally wounded. Union Brigadier General [[Samuel Rice]] also was mortally wounded in the final Confederate assault at Jenkins' Ferry.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref> After taking about 1,000 casualties in their repeated attacks against the well-fortified Federals while inflicting only about 700, including capturing stragglers, the Confederates gave up the piecemeal attacks on the Union position.<ref>Foote, 1974, P. 75; Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> Before leaving the field, some African-American soldiers of the 2d Kansas Colored regiment shot Confederate wounded near Rice<U+2019>s line in retaliation for the shooting of African-American soldiers who were trying to surrender at Poison Spring and the killing of wounded African-American soldiers at Marks<U+2019> Mill.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref>

===Withdrawal, results and casualties===
By about 3:00 p.m., the Union forces finally crossed the Saline with all their remaining men and the artillery and supply wagons which were not irretrievably stuck in the mud and burned.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> Steele's forces were compelled to abandon many more wagons in the swamp north of the Saline.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 215.</ref> The Confederates did not renew the attack as Steele's men crossed the pontoon bridge on the afternoon of April 30. Not only were the Confederates exhausted from the morning<U+2019>s battle, but the Union forces had set up artillery and infantry on the opposite side of the river to protect the remaining Federal forces as they crossed.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214.</ref> After crossing the Saline River, Steele's forces cut and burned the pontoon bridge, which they would not need for the remainder of their march, so that the Confederates could not follow them.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref> By not trapping Steele's force at Camden or cutting them off before they reached the Saline River, the Confederates under Kirby Smith lost a good chance to destroy Steele's army, which was the major portion of Union forces in Arkansas.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref> After crossing the river and three days' further march, Steele<U+2019>s forces regrouped within the fortifications of Little Rock.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 77; Faust, 1986, p. 107.</ref>

Considering the numbers engaged and percentage of casualties, the battle of Jenkins' Ferry was one of the Civil War's bloodiest battles.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref> Both armies paid dearly for the engagement. The Confederates officially reported 86 men killed, 356 wounded, and one missing for a total of 443 casualties. The numbers would doubtless have been much higher, perhaps 800 to 1,000, if Walker's Texas division's losses were known. Walker filed no report on the battle. Officially reported but incomplete Union casualties were 63 killed, 413 wounded, and 45 missing, a total of 521 casualties.<ref>Eicher, 2001, p. 654 gives lower numbers and a more even distribution of casualties: Union 64 killed, 378 wounded, 86 missing; Confederate 86 killed 356 wounded, 1 missing, without mentioning the incomplete reports.</ref> The Union total casualty figure was incomplete because Brigadier General John Thayer filed no report. As noted above, in view of the incomplete or missing casualty reports, historians [[Shelby Foote]] and Gregory J. W. Urwin in the Heidlers' ''Encyclopedia of the American Civil War'' used 1,000 and 700 as the best estimate of total Confederate and Union casualty figures, respectively, for this battle.<ref>Foote, 1974, p. 75; Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref>

The Battle of Jenkins' Ferry may be counted as a Union victory, at least tactically.<ref>The National Park Service battle summary calls it a "Union victory in retreat." http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/ar016.htm.</ref> Not only did the Confederates sustain more casualties, but Steele's Federal forces successfully held back the attacking Confederates. This allowed the Union forces time and space to move most of their remaining wagons, artillery and infantry across the Saline River and to escape back to the safety of Little Rock. Yet, Steele's victory was hollow from a strategic viewpoint. Kirby Smith<U+2019>s forces held the battlefield, prevented Steele from joining with or further assisting Banks and forced Steele's continued retreat back to Little Rock. In the campaign overall, Steele had lost 3,000 men to Smith<U+2019>s loss of 2,000, many of them lightly wounded. Steele had lost 10 artillery pieces to balance with 3 captured. He also lost 635 wagons, 2,500 mules, enough horses to mount a cavalry brigade and a long list of captured material, including ammunition, food and medical supplies.<ref>Foote, 1974, p.76. McPherson, 2005, p. 150 gives slightly different overall casualty figures, stating that Steele had lost almost 2,500 soldiers while the Confederates lost about half that many.</ref>

Kirby Smith's last hope to destroy Steele's army outside of his well-fortified base at Little Rock was dashed as a result of the mismanaged and disjointed attacks at Jenkins' Ferry, in which the Confederate infantry was pushed in piecemeal instead of in a concentrated attack. Although the Union position and weather conditions limited Confederate options, a more concentrated effort appears to have been possible. The Confederates also failed to concentrate on the Union's more vulnerable left flank at the outset, choosing instead to pursue frontal assaults across Kelly's field, where the Southern lines of infantry were devastated by Union fire. Assuming Rice had left this weak spot in or just beyond his defenses, this early Confederate missed opportunity allowed Rice to see the possible vulnerability and to extend and protect the Union left. After the Union left flank was closed off, any opportunity for a successful Confederate attack at that point and any realistic chance Kirby Smith and Price might have had to trap most of Steele's force was gone.<ref>Josephy, 1991, p. 214; Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 1069.</ref>

==Aftermath==
After his situation had become hopeless at Camden, [[Frederick Steele|Steele]] gave up all thoughts of uniting with Major General [[Nathaniel Banks]] on the Red River in a campaign to take Shreveport and realized that he had to save his army. The battle of Jenkins' Ferry showed that Steele's force indeed was in danger at Camden and southwest of the Saline River and his decision to retreat to Little Rock was a good one. Banks in turn had to give up any hope of renewing his campaign against Shreveport. His major problems in renewing the campaign did not include an insufficient number of men, however, because he was reinforced in late April by forces under Major General [[John McClernand]]. He also had logistical problems and would not have gunboat transport and support because of [[David Dixon Porter|Porter<U+2019>s]] inability to operate in the unusually low water of the Red River. In fact, Banks had to protect Porter<U+2019>s fleet at Alexandria, LA until it could be freed from the Red River on May 13 before he could move in any direction.<ref>Faust, 1986, p. 620; Foote, 1974, pp. 61, 84. Foote states that Banks and his forces left Alexandria on May 13, the day after Porter was able to get past the rapids, which allowed his flotilla to make it back to the Mississippi River.</ref>

Despite some Confederate disappointment in not destroying, through casualties or capture, most of the Union forces engaged in the [[Red River Campaign]], the Confederates had a considerable tactical victory. The Federals lost over 8,000 men in the Red River Campaign, including the [[Camden Expedition]], and returned to their starting points at the end of it. The Confederates lost about 6,500. The Confederates captured 57 artillery pieces, about a thousand wagons, most of them loaded, and 3,500 horses and mules.<ref>Foote, 1974, p.91</ref>

As Shelby Foote noted, the Confederates also gained a strategic victory in the Red River Campaign.<ref>Foote, 1974, p.91</ref> They were able to delay the return of [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Andrew J. Smith|Andrew Smith<U+2019>s]] 10,000-man force to [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William T. Sherman|Sherman's]] army for use in the [[Atlanta Campaign]]. Also, about 20,000 Confederate soldiers from Alabama were able to reinforce [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Joseph E. Johnston|Joe Johnston]] in his campaign against Sherman. These forces otherwise might have been engaged in Alabama had Banks attacked [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile, AL]], as [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] would have preferred, rather than attempt to take Shreveport under [[Henry Halleck|Halleck<U+2019>s]] plan.<ref>As Shelby Foote noted, in fairness to Banks, even he would have preferred to move against Mobile rather than Shreveport.</ref> The Union tied up significant forces in the Red River Campaign and lost significant numbers of artillery pieces, wagons, mules and supplies that could have been used in the more decisive campaigns further east. Yet, [[Edmund Kirby Smith|Kirby Smith]] could not get his forces back to Alexandria, LA in time for a further attempt to capture or destroy Banks's force. The disruption and retreat of Union forces in Arkansas also cleared the way for [[Price's Raid|Price's 1864 invasion of Missouri]]. Ultimately that campaign provided no long term benefit to the Confederates, who were driven out of Missouri again after the [[Battle of Westport]] and an offensive by Union cavalry under Major General [[Alfred Pleasonton]], which defeated the Confederates in 4 battles in 5 days following the battle of Westport.<ref>Heidler and Heidler, 2000, p. 2093.</ref>
