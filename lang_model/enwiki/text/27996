{{Keith and Dufftown Railway (GNoSR)}}
The '''Keith and Dufftown Railway''' is an historic railway in [[Scotland]] that ran between [[Dufftown]] and [[Keith, Moray|Keith]]. The company was formed in 1857, the line was opened in 1862, and it was absorbed by the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] in 1866.

==History==

The [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] (GNoSR) opened its main line in stages; the section between {{stnlnk|Huntly}} and {{stnlnk|Keith}} was opened on 10 October 1856.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=30}} Keith remained the terminus for less than two years; on 18 August 1858, the [[Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway]] (I&AJR) opened the last section of their line, between {{stnlnk|Elgin}} and Keith,{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=31}} and it was now possible to travel between [[Aberdeen Waterloo railway station|Aberdeen]] and {{stnlnk|Inverness}} by rail.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=32}} The I&AJR had an end-on junction with the [[Inverness and Nairn Railway]] at {{stnlnk|Nairn}}, and these two companies amalgamated in 1861, soon amalgamating with others, to form the [[Highland Railway]].{{sfn|Vallance|Clinker|Lambert|1985|pp=28<U+2013>29}} Although the GNoSR owned shares to the value of <U+00A3>40,000 in the I&AJR, it did not become part of the Highland Railway, but were instead bought out; the GNoSR then remained independent of the I&AJR until their respective successors were nationalised in 1948.{{sfn|Vallance|Clinker|Lambert|1985|pp=22<U+2013>23}}

The GNoSR wished to have its own route west of Keith, with [[Grantown-on-Spey]] as an objective - here they hoped to meet any possible line between Perth and Inverness.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=33}} To this end, they invested in the Keith and Dufftown Railway (K&DR); this company was incorporated on 27 July 1857, but progress was slow because of lack of money.{{sfn|Awdry|1990|p=140}}
{{sfn|Vallance|1991|pp=33,53<U+2013>54}} Powers for a longer, but cheaper, route between the two towns were secured on 25 May 1860, and this line was opened on 21 February 1862.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=54}} The revised route included steeper gradients than those planned in 1857; the maximum gradient was now 1 in 60 (1.667%) instead if 1 in 70 (1.429%).{{sfn|Vallance|1991|pp=53<U+2013>54}} There was a viaduct over the Fiddich of two spans, and there were three intermediate stations: {{stnlnk|Earlsmill}} (renamed {{stnlnk|Keith Town}} in 1897), {{stnlnk|Botriphnie}} (renamed {{stnlnk|Auchindachy}} in 1862) and {{stnlnk|Drummuir}}.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=54}} From the start, the trains were worked by the GNoSR under an agreement dating back to the formation of the company.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=33}}

The line became a through route with the opening of the first section of the [[Strathspey Railway (GNoSR)|Strathspey Railway]] between Dufftown and {{stnlnk|Abernethy}} on 1 July 1863;{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=55}} at {{stnlnk|Craigellachie}} there was a junction, where the line was met by a short extension of the [[Morayshire Railway]] (MR) from {{stnlnk|Dandaleith}}, which opened the same day.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=45}} The MR had already opened between {{stnlnk|Elgin}} and Dandaleith in 1862,{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=43}} so there was now a route between Keith and Elgin independent of the I&AJR.{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=45}}

On 30 July 1866, the GNoSR obtained an Act of Parliament authorising it to amalgamate with several associated railways, including the K&DR and the Strathspey Railway; this took place on 1 August 1866.{{sfn|Awdry|1990|p=140}}{{sfn|Vallance|1991|p=65}}
