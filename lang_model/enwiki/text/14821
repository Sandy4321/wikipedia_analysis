'''Irvin Mayfield, Jr.''' (born {{Birth date|1977|9|7}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[jazz]] [[trumpeter]], [[organist]] and [[bandleader]], who was born and is based in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and is best known for co-founding and co-leading the [[Latin jazz]] group [[Los Hombres Calientes]] with Bill Summers. Mayfield has released ten albums since 1998, and has played at prominent Jazz Festivals during his career. 

In [[September]] of [[2003]], Mayfield was unanimously bestowed with the title of [[Cultural Ambassador]] for the [[City of New Orleans]] by the [[United States Senate]] and other governmental bodies. His performance at the [[Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert (album)|Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert]] gained national attention in syndication. 

==Early life==

'''Irvin Mayfield, Jr''' was born on {{Birth date|1977|9|7}} in [[New Orleans]] to Irvin Mayfield, Sr and Joyce Alsanders.<ref>{{cite book| last = Yanow| first = Scott| authorlink = Scott Yanow| title = Trumpet Kings: The Players Who Shaped the Sound of Jazz Trumpet| publisher = Backbeat Books| date = 2001| pages = 250| doi = | isbn = 0879306084 }}
</ref> His mother was a [[school teacher]] at a school in the Upper [[Ninth Ward]] and is still living. He is the youngest of 5 brothers, and has 3 half-brothers and 1 half-sister from his mother's previous marriage. Growing up, he resided in several sections of New Orleans, including the Ninth Ward. His father, a military man, was once a [[drill sergeant]] in the [[United States Army]] and also a [[boxer]].<ref>"Ibid"; Berry, Jason</ref>

Mayfield received his first [[trumpet]] when he was in the [[4th grade]], asking his father for one after seeing the success a friend of his was having with girls by playing the instrument. Mayfield's father<U+2014>who had played trumpet in high school<U+2014>encouraged him to practice and improve as much as he could. The first song Mayfield learned to play was '''Just A Closer Walk With Thee'', which he performed at the [[Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert (album)|Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert]]<U+2014>one day before he learned that his father had died in the flood after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Early in his [[public school]] education, Mayfield befriended fellow schoolmate [[Jason Marsalis]]. Jason is the son of [[jazz pianist]] [[Ellis Marsalis]], and brother to fellow jazz musicians [[Branford Marsalis]], [[Wynton Marsalis]] and [[Delfeayo Marsalis]]. Mayfield grew close to the entire family. Mayfield also played [[organ (instrument)|organ]] at his church sometimes.<ref>{{cite web

==Career==

[[Image: Irvin_Mayfield2.jpg|thumb|left|Mayfield playing the trumpet - courtesy Basin Street Records]]
Mayfield began his musical career during the latter half of the [[1980s]], playing with the Algiers Brass Band, a traditional New Orleans based street act. His early work with the band was educational for him. In the late 1990s he shared an apartment in [[New York City]] with Wynton Marsalis for a brief period. Wynton was already an accomplished recording artist at the time.<ref>"Ibid"; Berry, Jason</ref>

In [[1998]] he co-found the [[Los Hombres Calientes]] band, an act which incorporates Latin music with New Orleans jazz. Shortly after forming, the band signed with Basin Street Records, a [[New Orleans]]-based [[jazz]] [[record label]],<ref>{{cite book| last = Yanow| first = Scott| authorlink = Scott Yanow| title = Afro-Cuban Jazz| publisher = [[Backbeat Books]]| date = 2000| pages = 65| doi = | isbn = 087930619X }}</ref> His recording debut with Los Hombres Calientes was a success, and Mayfield gained national recognition as a result. Though the band has not released a studio album since [[2005]], they still remain active.<ref>{{cite web| last = | first = | last= | title = Hombres featured at last <U+2018>Jazz Notables<U+2019> concert| url=http://www.theadvertiser.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070430/NEWS01/70430015| accessdate = 2007-05-27 }}</ref> On [[June 26]], [[2006]], in commemoration of ''Black Music Month'', Mayfield held a performance at the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with fellow musician Ronald Markham.<ref>{{cite web

As a young man he attended and graduated from [[NOCCA]], acquiring a [[college scholarship|scholarship]] to the famous [[Juilliard School of Music]] based in [[New York City]]. Instead of accepting the scholarship, at the behest of [[Ellis Marsalis]], he decided to attend [[University of New Orleans]] instead (where Ellis ran the jazz studies department). In spite of being an educational experience for him, he left within his first year.<ref>"Ibid", Berry, Jason</ref>

In [[2005]] he joined [[Wynton Marsalis]] and a host of other musicians at the [[Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert (album)|Higher Ground Hurricane Relief Benefit Concert]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. [[New York Times]] jazz [[critic]] [[Jon Pareles]] wrote in an article on the event, "The concert's most touching moment was a performance by the New Orleans trumpeter Irvin Mayfield. His father, he said, is still among the missing. He played "Just a Closer Walk with Thee," the hymn that becomes both dirge and celebration at New Orleans funerals."<ref>{{cite web

===New Orleans Jazz Orchestra===
In [[December]] of 2002 Mayfield founded the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, of which he still serves as artistic director, a [[jazz ensemble]] that is a [[non-profit]] national organization dedicated to education in the performing arts.<ref>{{cite web

===Strange Fruit===

[[Image:Strange Fruit (Irvin Mayfield).jpg|thumbnail|right|The cover of the album "Strange Fruit", with the Dillard University choir and his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra.]]

The idea for Mayfield's "Strange Fruit", a 90-minute opus based in 1920s Louisiana, came about on a visit to a photographic exhibit in [[Atlanta]] called ''Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography In America'' in 2002. The exhibit features photographs from the book of the same name by Hilton Als and James Allen. With him was then president of [[Dillard University]] and current head of the [[United Negro College Fund]] [[Michael Lomax]]. Lomax encouraged him to develop a way to express this American story through music. 

Photographs from this exhibit can be viewed at [http://www.withoutsanctuary.org/ withoutsanctuary.org]. The piece was commissioned by [[Dillard University]], and Mayfield has brought it to a number of [[Historically black colleges and universities]]. The music combines jazz elements with [[negro spirituals]] and [[classical music]]. <ref>{{cite web| last = Smiley| first = Tavis| title = Irvin Mayfield's 'Strange Fruit' Opus| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1499418| accessdate = 2007-05-28 }}</ref> 

The composition follows the lives of three main characters named Charles, Mary Anne and Leroy. Charles is a 25 year old white man from a family of bankers, just back from college and ready to start a family. Leroy is a young black man in his early 20s from a well-to-do black family and son of a preacher, off for the summer and ready for college. 
Mary Anne is a young white woman courted by Charles, but who falls in love with Leroy. When Charles discovers what has happened while he was away at college, he beats Mary Anne and reports to the sherriff that Leroy beat and raped her. The town forms a [[lynch mob]] and the governer is set to attend. Feeling some remorse for what he had brought about, Charles confesses to the sherriff that he had beaten Mary Anne and that she never had been raped. The sherriff, unwilling to cancel due to the visit of the governer, allowed the lynching to proceed anyway. The show premiered at Dillard in [[2003]].<ref>"Ibid"; Smiley, Tavis</ref>

===Jazz Festivals===

''Jazz festivals Mayfield has performed at:''

* [[Newport Jazz Festival]] 
* Atlanta Jazz Festival 
* [[Clifford Brown Jazz Festival]]
* French Quarter Festival
* New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival
* New Orleans Mardis Gras celebrations<ref>"Ibid"; Basin Street Records</ref>

==Other endeavors==

''In addition to his role as Cultural Ambassador, Mayfield also holds positions both at the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce and the Champions Group of the New Orleans Museum of Art. He is also Artistic Director for the Chandler Jazz Festival in [[Arizona]].''

===Culural Ambassador===

{{Quote box|width=300px|quote=The only things that could make New Orleans moreso of a cultural Mecca, is if the consitution was written there. But the music, the constitution of the music, was created. That's where jazz was born. Jazz is the music of America, and really jazz is the manifestation of democracy in the music.|source='''Irvin Mayfield'''|[[NPR]] [[Morning Edition]] ([[September 2]], [[2005]])}}

Mayfield was made Cultural Ambassador of the City of New Orleans by state and local governments in [[September]] of 2003.<ref>{{cite web

*The Louisiana Rebirth Advisory Board
*The Bring New Orleans Back Commission Cultural Sub-Committee
*The Hyatt New Orleans District Rebirth Advisory Board

<u>'''Thoughts on Mardis Gras'''</u>

According to Mayfield, there are not as many musicians at [[New Orleans Mardi Gras|Mardi Gras]] as there once were in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. People are still relocating back to the area and moving back in town, but the sense of loss is still felt very much by musicians and residents like Mayfield. Whole portions of the town that once held their own celebrations during the festival no longer exist, and the community seems fractured still.<ref>{{cite web

<u>'''Rebuilding New Orleans'''</u>

Mayfield supports plans for a 20-acre "National Jazz Center" to be built in New Orleans, a complex  that would use both public and private money for funding ([[Hyatt]] being one funder). The proposition has stirred debate among musicians and residents of New Orleans, and the price has raised some eyebrows. The idea is to create something similar to [[Millennium Park]] in [[Chicago]]. The plan is attracting entrepreneurial interests that reside outside of the area, which gives some local residents cause for concern.<ref>{{cite web

===Institute of Jazz Culture===

In the fall of [[2002]] Mayfield founded the Institute of Jazz Culture at [[Dillard University]], having been an artist-in-residence there since [[1995]].<ref>"Ibid"; Basin Street Records Bio</ref> The mission of the Institute is to combine several educational approaches toward jazz music, offering courses which combine music with [[Political science|politics]] and [[Cultural studies|culture]]. Affiliated with the Institute is [[Dr. Michael White]], holder of the Keller Chair of the Humanities at nearby [[Xavier University (New Orleans)|Xavier University]] (a fellow recording artist for the Bason Street Records label, also). Much of the inspiration for founding the Institute came from Mayfield's time spent living with Marsalis as Artistic Director of [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]] in [[New York]], wondering why New Orleans did not have such a place.<ref>{{cite web
