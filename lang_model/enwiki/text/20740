'''Fake denominations of United States currency''' have been created by individuals as [[practical joke]]s and do not assert that they are legal tender.  The bills often have images of their enemies or other people.  The bills usually have "THIS IS NOT LEGAL TENDER FOR ANY DEBTS, THE PUBLIC, OR PRIVATE".  The [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] declares them legal to print as long as they are not used as genuine currency.

Although both the colony of Massachusetts <ref>[http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/42400/42499/pm_ma_1780_42499.htm Educational Technological clearinghouse--Paper Money, Three Dollar Bill, 1780]</ref> and the [[United Colonies of America|United Colonies]]<ref>[http://www.awesomestories.com/assets/three-dollar-bill United Colonies Currency - Three Dollar Bill - Awesome Stories]</ref> ''did'' print $3 bills the United States never issued one (though they did issue a [[Three-dollar piece|$3 coin]] from 1854 to 1889).

Legitimate three-dollar bills were also produced by various banks in the early days of the United States and by the [[Confederacy]].<ref>http://threes.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2395&Itemid=39</ref> Prior to the creation of the [[Federal Reserve System]], individual banks offered their own currencies.<ref>Common Place vol. 4 no. 4, Stephen Mihm. http://www.common-place.org/vol-04/no-04/mihm/2.shtml</ref> 

Various fake $3 bills have been released over time, generally poking fun at politicians or celebrities such as: [[Richard Nixon]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[George W. Bush]],[[Bill Clinton]], and [[Hillary Clinton]], in reference to the idiomatic expression "queer as a three-dollar bill" or "phony as a three dollar bill". In the 1960s, ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine printed a three-dollar bill that featured a portrait of [[Alfred E. Neuman]] and read: "This is not legal tender<U+2014>nor will [[Meat tenderizer|tenderizer]] help it."<ref>''The MAD World of William M. Gaines,'' by [[Frank Jacobs]], 1972; [[Lyle Stuart]]</ref>

In 2001, a man purchased $99 worth of merchandise at a [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]] [[Charming Shoppes|Fashion Bug]] with a $200 bill featuring then-President [[George W. Bush]]. The man was later charged with forgery, theft by deception and receiving stolen property.<ref name="$200">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5890269/|title=In Anything We Trust|accessdate=2009-01-30|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=2004-09-01|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040902072028/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5890269/|archivedate=2004-09-02}}</ref> A man in [[Kentucky]] passed a similar counterfeit bill at a local [[Dairy Queen]], receiving $198 in change.<ref name="$200"/>

Many businesses print million dollar bills. They are sold as novelties, and do not assert that they are legal tender. The [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] has declared them legal to print or own and does not consider them [[counterfeit]] because no genuine million dollar bill exists or ever has existed.  At least one vendor printed the bills using the same intaglio printing process and cotton rag stock as actual currency, using the American Bank Note Company as their printing contractor.

In March 2004, Alice Regina Pike attempted to use a $1,000,000 bill with a picture of the [[Statue of Liberty]] on the front to purchase $1671.55 in goods from a [[Wal-Mart]] in [[Covington, Georgia]], for which she was arrested.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4489683/Woman says she thought $1 million bill was real], AP, via MSNBC.com, March 11, 2004.</ref>

In November 2007, Alexander D. Smith tried to open a bank account in [[Aiken County, South Carolina]], by depositing a $1,000,000 bill. The bank employee refused to deposit the bill and called the police. Smith was immediately arrested on a charge of forgery.<ref>[http://www.nbcaugusta.com/news/local/11852036.html Fake Million Dollar Bill Lands Man in Jail]</ref>

The [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] makes an annual tradition of handing out informational fliers made to look like $1,000,000 bills on April 15 to draw attention to its anti-[[income tax]] platform.

Though not meant to be used as actual legal tender, [[Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Ray Comfort]]'s ministry, [[The Way of the Master#Living Waters Publications|Living Waters Publications]], produces a fake $1,000,000 bill <U+2013> resembling an amalgam of the [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|series 1996 $100 bill]] and the [[United States ten-dollar bill|series 2004 $10 bill]], and featuring [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] <U+2013> which is in reality a [[Tract (literature)|Christian gospel tract]], with the gospel message printed on the reverse. They have printed other designs in the past, including one featuring [[Grover Cleveland]], based on the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|series 2004 $20 bill]]. All versions have included one or more links to the ministry's websites and the statement "This is NOT legal tender for all debts, public and private." After someone attempted to deposit one of the fake bills in [[North Carolina]], the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raided The Great News Network, a sister ministry to LWP based in [[Denton, Texas]], on June 2, 2006. The Secret Service told workers at GNN they would locate and seize all of the million dollar bills at LWP's [[Bellflower, California]], headquarters. Comfort has been advised by his lawyers to refuse such an action, and no warrants yet appear to have been issued for the tracts.<ref>[http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50495 Feds seize 'millions' in gospel tracts<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref><ref>[http://worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=50497 Christians to battle Feds on 'million-dollar' tracts<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> However, in a precautionary move, LWP also temporarily produced an enlarged "Secret Service version".<ref>[http://www.livingwaters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=217 Darwin $10,000 bill: Living Waters Store<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref>

''[[The Mad Magazine Game]]'' features a $1,329,063 bill that serves as an [[Old maid (card game)|Old Maid]] in the game, in which the players compete to lose all their money. The bill features a portrait of [[Alfred E. Neuman]].

==$1,000,000,000==
In March 2006, agents from [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|ICE]] and the Secret Service seized 250 notes, each bearing a denomination of $1,000,000,000 (one billion USD) from a [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] apartment.<ref>[http://communitydispatch.com/Department_of_Homeland__Security_63/HOMELAND_SECURITY_AGENTS_SEIZE__BILLION_DOLLAR__BO_4175.shtml Homeland Security Agents Seize "Billion Dollar" Bogus Federal Reserve Notes]</ref> The suspect had previously been arrested on federal charges for attempting to smuggle more than $37,000 in currency into the U.S. following a trip to [[Korea]] in 2002.

In July 2006, Ray Comfort's ministry developed and began printing a $1,000,000,000 bill (one billion USD) similar to its fake $1,000,000 bill. Its color scheme more closely resembles the [[United States ten-dollar bill|series 2004A $10 bill]], although the background resembles the series 2004 $20 bill (like their "million-dollar bill"). The tract contains a similar gospel message and features to the million-dollar tract, but the picture is instead that of 19th century [[Great Britain|British]] evangelist [[Charles Spurgeon]], whose portrait obscures the last two zeros on the upper-left corner of the "bill".<ref>[http://www.livingwaters.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=262 Billion dollar bill: Living Waters Store<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> There have yet to be any repercussions from the Secret Service regarding this new tract.
