He appeared in only one start, a 7-6 loss against the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref name="firstgame">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN195909260.shtml|title=Sep 26, 1959, Pirates at Reds Play by Play and Box Score|work=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC.|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> He pitched seven innings, giving up five earned runs, including home runs to [[Johnny Temple]], [[Frank Thomas (outfielder)|Frank Thomas]] and [[Buddy Gilbert]], while striking out three.<ref name="stats"/> Umbricht left the game in position for the win, as the Pirates were leading 6-5, but reliever [[Don Gross (baseball)|Don Gross]] gave up two earned runs in the ninth inning for the blown save and the loss.<ref name="firstgame"/>

According to former teammate and roommate [[Ken Johnson (right-handed pitcher)|Ken Johnson]], Umbricht was used by the Colts mainly to control damage caused by a starting pitcher after they were removed from the game. In his five-year Major League Baseball career, Umbricht compiled a 9-5 win<U+2013>loss record, while recording 133 [[strikeout]]s, three [[save (baseball)|saves]] and a 3.06 earned run average in 88 games.<ref name="stats"/>

==Cancer and early death== 
=== Cancer diagnosis and 1963 season ===
At the beginning of spring training [[1963 Houston Colt .45s season|1963 season]], Umbricht noticed that he had a small black lump in his leg, near the thigh area while playing golf with Richards.<ref name=Zimniuch134/> He originally ignored it, but the lump was growing at a rapid pace and Richards told Umbricht to have it checked by a doctor back in Houston.<ref name=Zimniuch134/> The doctors confirmed it was a [[melanoma]] tumor, which had spread to his groin area.<ref name=Zimniuch134/> He underwent a six-hour surgery to remove the tumor from the leg in March 1963 and soon learned that he had a slim chance of survival and kept it a secret outside his immediate family.<ref name="obit2"/><ref name=Zimniuch135/> Umbricht was persistent to return to pitch for the Colt .45s and was in uniform by opening day.<ref name="obit2"/> The surgery took a toll on his leg: he required over 100 [[Surgical suture|stitches]] and blood was coming out from the wound while he pitched at times.<ref name=Zimniuch135/> That year Umbricht posted a 4-3 won-loss record and a 2.61 earned run average in 35 games.<ref name="stats"/> He played his last game on September 29, 1963, the final day of the regular season.<ref name="stats"/> By that time, Umbricht's cancer had started to spread throughout his body and he had to be sedated at times from the pain of the cancer.<ref name="obit"/> In November Umbricht learned that the cancer was incurable, and was given a few months to live.<ref name=Zimniuch135/> He was released by the Colts on December 16.<ref name="stats"/> His battle with cancer made national headlines. Several sportswriters named Umbricht as the "Most Courageous Athlete" of the year.<ref name=Zimniuch135/>

=== Final months and death ===
By early 1964, Umbricht was going in and out of the hospital on a constant basis for further treatment. He returned to the hospital permanently on March 16, where his health steadily declined.<ref name="obit"/> During his final hospital stay, the Colts' management, his family and the hospital staff agreed not to release any further details about his illness, though word had leaked that he was dying.<ref name="obit2"/> Umbricht succumbed to the disease on April 8, 1964 in the [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]].<ref name="obit2"/> Umbricht's death came on the eve of the 1964 season for the Colts. Several members of the team attended the funeral, with manager [[Harry Craft]] and teammate [[Dick Farrell]] among the six pallbearers.<ref name="obit"/> Teammate [[Russ Kemmerer]] gave the eulogy during the service, and Umbricht's body was cremated.<ref name="armband"/> Construction of the [[Reliant Astrodome|Astrodome]], the Colts' future ballpark had just started when Umbricht died. Umbricht's family decided to spread his ashes on the future stadium, so "it could be his headstone".<ref name=Zimniuch135/> His brother Ed flew over the construction site right after the funeral service and scattered his ashes throughout its grounds.<ref name=Zimniuch135/>

== Aftermath and legacy==
The day after his death the Colts decided to honor their teammate by wearing black wristbands for the entire 1964 season.<ref name="armband"/> Umbricht uniform number (32) was immediately [[retired number|retired]] by the team; the first time the club retired a uniform number, and only the ninth time in Major League history a number was ever by a team.<ref name=Zimniuch135/> In the Colts' opening day match against the Cincinnati Reds, starting pitcher Ken Johnson dedicated his victory in Umbright's memory. In 1965, the Houston Colt .45s became known as the Houston Astros. The Astros' MVP award was also named in his honor.<ref name="retirednumber2006">{{cite news|title=Playing the (jersey) numbers game|last=Estelle|first=Bob|date=June 25, 2006|work=Post-Tribune (IN).|publisher=Sun-Times News Group ([[HighBeam Research]])|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> The back of Umbricht's 1964 [[Topps]] baseball card was updated to mention his death right before printing.<ref name="retirednumber2006"/> Umbricht's number retirement had their share of critics however. Former teammate [[Jimmy Wynn]] mentioned in his autobiography that [[Walt Bond]], a former Astros player who was African-American, died from [[leukemia]] while he was still active.

Umbricht's death from melanoma helped alert the general public about the disease. Former [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] linebacker [[Jack Pardee]] credited Umbricht's battle with melanoma for saving his life in 1965.<ref name="Pardee">{{cite news|title=Off NFL merry-go-round, Pardee enjoys life on the ranch.|last=Buck|first=Ray|date=September 5, 2003|work=Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service|publisher=McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via [[HighBeam Research]]|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Pardee, a [[Pro Bowl]] linebacker, had been ignoring a mole on his armpit for a while.
