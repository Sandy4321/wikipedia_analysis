'''Idries Abutahir Shah''' (16 June, 1924&ndash;23 November, 1996) ({{lang-fa|'''<U+0627><U+062F><U+0631><U+06CC><U+0633> <U+0634><U+0627><U+0647>'''}}), also known as '''Idris Shah''', n<U+00E9> '''[[Sayyid]] Idris [[Hashemite|Hashimi]]''' (Arabic: '''<U+0633><U+064A><U+062F> <U+0625><U+062F><U+0631><U+064A><U+0633> <U+0647><U+0627><U+0634><U+0645><U+064A>'''), was an author and teacher in the [[Sufism|Sufi]] tradition who wrote over three dozen critically acclaimed books on topics ranging from psychology and spirituality to travelogues and culture studies. 

Born in India, the descendant of a family of [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] nobles, Shah grew up mainly in England. His early writings from the mid 1950s centred on travel and the history and anthropology of [[magic]] and [[witchcraft]]. In 1960 he founded a publishing house, Octagon Press, publishing translations of Sufi classics and those of his own titles that by then were out-of-print. His most seminal work was ''[[The Sufis]]'', first published by W H Allen in 1964 and well-received internationally. In 1965, Shah founded the [[Institute for Cultural Research]], a London-based educational charity devoted to the study of human behaviour and culture. A similar organization, the [[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge]] (ISHK), exists in the United States, under the directorship of [[Stanford University]] psychology professor [[Robert Ornstein]], whom Shah appointed as his deputy in the U.S.

In his writings, Shah presented [[Sufism]] as a universal form of wisdom that predated [[Islam]]. Emphasizing that Sufism was not static, but always adapted itself to the current time, place and people, he framed his teaching in Western psychological terms. Shah made extensive use of traditional [[teaching stories]] and [[parable]]s, texts containing multiple layers of meaning designed to trigger insight and self-reflection in the reader. He is perhaps best known for his collections of humorous [[Nasreddin|Mulla Nasrudin]] stories. 

Shah was at times criticized by orientalists who questioned his credentials and background. His role in the controversy surrounding a new translation of the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]], published by his friend [[Robert Graves]] and his older brother [[Omar Ali-Shah]], came in for particular scrutiny. But he also had many notable defenders, chief among them the novelist [[Doris Lessing]]. Shah came to be recognized as a spokesman for Sufism in the West and lectured as a visiting professor at a number of Western universities. His works have played a significant part in presenting the essence of Sufism as a non-confessional and individualistic distillation of spiritual wisdom.

===Graves controversy===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Shah came under attack over a controversy surrounding the [[Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam#Robert_Graves_and_Omar_Ali-Shah|1967 publication of a new translation]] of [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat]], by Robert Graves and Shah's older brother, [[Omar Ali-Shah]].<ref name="OISTI" /><ref name="DLES" /> The translation, which presented the Rubaiyat as a Sufic poem, was based on an annotated "[[Crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]", supposedly derived from a manuscript that had been in the Shah family's possession for 800 years.<ref name="eagle">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844564,00.html|title=Stuffed Eagle - Time|publisher=www.time.com

Shah's father, the Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah, was expected by Graves to present the original manuscript to clear the matter up, but he died in a car accident in [[Tangier]] in November 1969.<ref name="Graves" /> A year later, Graves asked Idries Shah to produce the manuscript, but Shah replied in a letter that doing so would prove nothing <U+2013> the manuscript's authenticity could still be contested.<ref name="Graves" /> It was time, Shah wrote, "that we realized that the hyenas who are making so much noise are intent only on opposition, destructiveness and carrying on a campaign when, let's face it, nobody is really listening."<ref name="Graves" /> He added that his father had been so infuriated by those casting these aspersions that he refused to engage with them, and he felt his father's response had been correct.<ref name="Graves" /> Graves, noting that he was now widely perceived as having fallen prey to the Shah brothers' gross deception, and that this affected income from sales of his other historical writings, insisted that producing the manuscript had become "a matter of family honour".<ref name="Graves" /> He pressed Shah again, reminding him of previous promises to produce the manuscript if it were necessary.<ref name="Graves" /> 

Shah never did produce the manuscript, leading Graves' nephew and biographer to muse that it was hard to believe <U+2013> bearing in mind the Shah brothers' many obligations to Graves <U+2013> that they would have withheld the manuscript if it had ever existed in the first place.<ref name="Graves">{{cite book

Man is therefore invited to push his evolution ahead towards what is sometimes called in Sufism 'real intellect'."<ref name="HW" /> Shah taught that the human being could acquire new subtle sense organs in response to need:<ref name="Galin" />

{{quotation|Sufis believe that, expressed in one way, humanity is evolving towards a certain destiny. We are all taking part in that evolution. Organs come into being as a result of the need for specific organs ([[Rumi]]). The human being's organism is producing a new complex of organs in response to such a need. In this age of transcending of time and space, the complex of organs is concerned with the transcending of time and space. What ordinary people regard as sporadic and occasional outbursts of [[telepathy|telepathic]] or prophetic power are seen by the Sufi as nothing less than the first stirrings of these same organs. The difference  between all evolution up to date and the present need for evolution  is that for the past ten thousand years or so we have been given the possibility of a conscious evolution. So essential is this  more rarefied evolution that our future depends upon it.|Idries Shah, ''The Sufis''<ref name="Sufis54">{{cite book

Shah dismissed other Eastern and Western projections of Sufism as "watered down, generalized or partial"; he included in this not only Khan's version, but also the overtly Muslim forms of Sufism found in most Islamic countries.<ref name="HW" /> He portrayed himself as representing the "People of the Tradition", a remote top echelon of Sufis supposedly located in the inaccessible [[Hindukush]] of Afghanistan, and his associates produced a number of books implying that Shah was the "Grand Sheikh of the Sufis", a position of authority undercut by the failure of any other Sufis to acknowledge its existence.<ref name="HW" />

Shah and Ornstein met in the 1960s.<ref name="Westerlund53" /> Realizing that Ornstein could be an ideal partner in propagating his teachings, translating them into the idiom of [[psychotherapy]], Shah made him his deputy (''[[khalifa]]'') in the United States.<ref name="SW31" /><ref name="Westerlund53" /> Ornstein's ''The Psychology of Consciousness'' (1972) was enthusiastically received by the academic psychology community, as it coincided with new interests in the field, such as the study of [[biofeedback]] and other techniques designed to achieve shifts in mood and awareness.<ref name="Westerlund53" /> Ornstein has published more books in the field over the years.<ref name="Westerlund53" />

In their original historical and cultural setting, Sufi teaching stories of the kind popularized by Shah <U+2013> first told orally, and later written down for the purpose of transmitting Sufi faith and practice to successive generations <U+2013> were considered suitable for people of all ages, including children, as they contained multiple layers of meaning.<ref name="Galin" /> Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach: "A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone <U+2013> or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth."<ref name="Galin" /> It was in this manner that Shah invited his audience to receive the Sufi story.<ref name="Galin" /> By failing to uncover the kernel, and regarding the story as merely amusing or superficial, a person  would accomplish nothing more than looking at the peach, while others internalized the tale and allowed themselves to be touched by it.<ref name="Galin" />

===Views on culture and practical life===

Shah's concern was to reveal essentials underlying all cultures, and the hidden factors determining individual behaviour.<ref name="Makers" /> He discounted the Western focus on appearances and superficialities, which often reflected mere fashion and habit, and drew attention to the origins of culture and the unconscious and mixed motivations of people and the groups formed by them.<ref name="Makers" /> He also pointed out how both on the individual and group levels, short-term disasters often turn into blessings <U+2013> and vice versa <U+2013> and yet the knowledge of this has done little to affect the way people respond to events as they occur.<ref name="Makers" /> 

Shah did not advocate the abandonment of worldly duties; instead, he argued that the treasure sought by the would-be disciple should derive from one's struggles in everyday living.<ref name="Galin" /> He considered practical work the means through which a seeker could do self-work, in line with the traditional adoption by Sufis of ordinary professions, through which they earned their livelihoods and "worked" on themselves.<ref name="Galin" /> Shah's status as a teacher remained indefinable; disclaiming both the [[guru]] identity and any desire to found a [[cult]] or [[sect]], he also rejected the academic hat.<ref name="Makers" /> Michael Rubinstein, writing in ''Makers of Modern Culture'', concluded that "he is perhaps best seen as an embodiment of the tradition in which the contemplative and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] aspects of the mind are regarded as being most productive when working together."<ref name="Makers" />

== Reception ==
Idries Shah's books on Sufism achieved considerable critical acclaim, two of his works (''[[The Way of the Sufi]]'' and ''Reflections'') being chosen as "Outstanding Book of the Year" by the [[BBC]]'s "The Critics" programme.<ref name="DLES">{{cite news

===Critics===

The reception of Shah's movement was also marked by much controversy.<ref name="Galin" /> Some orientalists were hostile, in part because Shah presented classical Sufi writings as tools for self-development to be used by contemporary people, rather than as objects of historical study.<ref name="OISTI">{{cite news

Elwell-Sutton from Edinburgh University, Shah's fiercest critic, described his books as "trivial", replete with errors of fact, slovenly and inaccurate translations and even misspellings of Oriental names and words <U+2013> "a muddle of platitudes, irrelevancies and plain mumbo-jumbo", adding for good measure that Shah had "a remarkable opinion of his own importance".<ref name="ES">{{cite news

[[Image:Doris lessing 20060312 (jha).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Nobel-prize winner Doris Lessing was profoundly influenced by Shah.]] Another hostile critic was [[James Moore (Cornish author)|James Moore]], a Gurdjieffian who disagreed with Shah's assertion that Gurdjieff's teaching was essentially sufic in nature and took exception to the publication of a chronologically impossible, pseudonymous book on the matter (''[[The Teachers of Gurdjieff]]'' by Rafael Lefort) that was linked to Shah.<ref name="Moore" /> In a 1986 article in ''Religion Today'' (now the ''Journal of Contemporary Religion''), Moore covered the Bennett and Graves controversies and noted that Shah was surrounded by a "nimbus of exorbitant adulation: an adulation he himself has fanned".<ref name="Moore">{{cite journal

Moore questioned Shah's purported Sufi heritage and upbringing and deplored the body of pseudonymous Shah-school writings from such authors as "Omar Michael Burke Ph. D." and "Hadrat B. M. Dervish", who from 1960 heaped intemperate praise <U+2013> ostensibly from disinterested parties <U+2013> on Shah, referring to him as the "Tariqa Grand Sheikh Idries Shah Saheb", "Prince Idries Shah", "King Enoch", "The Presence", "The Studious King", the "Incarnation of Ah", and even the [[Qutub (Sufism)|Qutb]] or "Axis" <U+2013> all in support of Shah's incipient efforts to market Sufism to a Western audience.<ref name="Moore" /> He acknowledged that Shah had made a contribution of sorts in popularizing a [[humanism|humanistic]] Sufism, and had "brought energy and resource to his self-aggrandizement", but ended with the damning conclusion that Shah's was "a 'Sufism' without self-sacrifice, without self-transcendence, without the aspiration of [[gnosis]], without tradition, without the Prophet, without the [[Qur'an]], without Islam, and without God. Merely that."<ref name="Moore" /><ref name="Farouki" />

===Recognition===

Doris Lessing, one of Shah's greatest defenders,<ref name="Moore" /> stated in a 1981 interview: "I found Sufism as taught by Idries Shah, which claims to be the reintroduction of an ancient teaching, suitable for this time and this place. It is not some regurgitated stuff from the East or watered-down Islam or anything like that."<ref name="Galin" /> In 1996, commenting on Shah's death in ''The Daily Telegraph'', she stated that she met Shah because of ''[[The Sufis]]'', which was to her the most surprising book she had read, and a book that changed her life.<ref name="Lessingon">{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-10-03}}</ref> Describing Shah's <U+0153>uvre as a 
"phenomenon like nothing else in our time", she characterized him as a many-sided man, the wittiest person she ever expected to meet, kind, generous, modest ("Don't look so much at my face, but take what is in my hand", she quotes him as saying), and her good friend and teacher for 30-odd years.<ref name="Lessingon" />

[[Arthur J. Deikman]], a professor of [[psychiatry]] and long-time researcher in the area of [[meditation]] and change of consciousness who began his study of Sufi teaching stories in the early seventies, expressed the view that Western psychotherapists could benefit from the perspective provided by Sufism and its universal essence, provided suitable materials were studied in the correct manner and sequence.<ref name="Deikman">{{cite book

The Indian philosopher and mystic [[Osho]], commenting on Shah's work, described ''The Sufis'' as "just a diamond. The value of what he has done in ''The Sufis'' is immeasurable". He added that Shah was "the man who introduced Mulla Nasrudin to the West, and he has done an incredible service. He cannot be repaid. [...] Idries Shah has made just the small anecdotes of Nasrudin even more beautiful ... [he] not only has the capacity to exactly translate the parables, but even to beautify them, to make them more poignant, sharper."<ref>{{cite book

Richard Smoley and [[Jay Kinney]], writing in ''Hidden Wisdom: A Guide to the Western Inner Traditions'' (2006), pronounced Shah's ''The Sufis'' an "extremely readable and wide-ranging introduction to Sufism", adding that "Shah's own slant is evident throughout, and some historical assertions are debatable (none are footnoted), but no other book is as successful as this one in provoking interest in Sufism for the general reader."<ref name="HW250-251">{{cite book

According to [[Olav Hammer]], writing in ''Sufism in Europe and North America'' (2004), Shah's books introduced Sufism as a type of religious insight that had only a peripheral connection to the social formations and ritualized activities generally studied by scholars of Sufism.<ref name="Hammer">{{cite book

  | pages = 136<U+2013>138
  | isbn = 0415325919}}</ref> Instead, his books <U+2013> such as ''Thinkers of the East'' and ''The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin'' <U+2013> presented the core of Sufism as a form of spiritual wisdom subtly encoded in humorous anecdotes.<ref name="Hammer" /> As an example, Hammer cites a story telling of a man who has lost his key, and is desperately looking for it on the ground. Asked by a sympathetic neighbour if this is where he lost the key, the man says, "No, I lost it at home, but there is more light here than in my own house."<ref name="Hammer" /> Rightly read, this story can be understood as a parable for a spiritual quest.<ref name="Hammer" /> 

Questioning who Shah was, and what credentials he had for presenting such lore to the West, Hammer notes that during Shah's last years, when the generosity of admirers had made him truly wealthy, and he had become a respected figure among the higher echelons of British society, controversies arose due to discrepancies between autobiographical data <U+2013> mentioning kinship with the prophet [[Muhammad]], affiliations with a secret Sufi order in [[Central Asia]], or the tradition in which Gurdjieff was taught <U+2013> and recoverable historical facts.<ref name="Hammer" /> Quite possibly there may have been a link of kinship with the prophet [[Muhammad]], but after 1300 years, the number of people sharing such a link would be at least one million.<ref name="Hammer" /> Other elements of Shah's autobiography, however, appeared to have been pure fiction.<ref name="Hammer" /> Even so, Hammer noted that Shah's books have remained in public demand, and that he has played "a significant role in representing the essence of Sufism as a non-confessional, individualistic and life-affirming distillation of spiritual wisdom."<ref name="Hammer" />

When Elizabeth Hall interviewed Shah for ''[[Psychology Today]]'' in July 1975, she asked him: "For the sake of humanity, what would you like to see happen?" Shah replied: "What I would really want, in case anybody is listening, is for the products of the last 50 years of psychological research to be studied by the public, by everybody, so that the findings become part of their way of thinking (...) they have this great body of psychological information and refuse to use it."<ref>{{cite journal
