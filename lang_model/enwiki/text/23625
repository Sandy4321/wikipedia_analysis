'''''Little Lord Fauntleroy''''' is a [[1936 in film|1936]] [[drama film]] based on the 1886 [[Little Lord Fauntleroy|novel of the same name]] by [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]. The film stars [[Freddie Bartholomew]] as Cedric 'Ceddie' Errol, [[Dolores Costello]] as his mother, 'Dearest', and [[C. Aubrey Smith]] as his grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt. The film was critically well received and is now in the [[public domain]].

==Plot==
'Ceddie' Erroll (Freddie Bartholomew) and his widowed mother 'Dearest' (Dolores Costello) struggle to make ends meet in 1880s [[Brooklyn]] after the death of his father. Ceddie's prejudiced English grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt (C. Aubrey Smith), had disowned his son for marrying an American. However, the wealthy earl has Ceddie brought to England as his heir. Dearest  accompanies her son, but is not allowed to live at Dorincourt castle. For Ceddie's happiness, she does not tell him it is because of his grandfather's bigotry.

Ceddie is uncomfortable as an English aristocrat, but soon wins the hearts of his stern grandfather and everyone else. Then, a woman named Minna Tipton (Helen Flint) shows up, claiming to be the widow of the earl's eldest son, and that therefore her son Tom ([[Jackie Searl]]) is the real heir. Heartbroken, the earl agrees. Fortunately for Ceddie, his American friend Dick Tipton ([[Mickey Rooney]]) reads about the affair in the newspaper and recognizes his sister-in-law. He takes his brother, Minna's husband, to England to disprove Minna's story. Vastly relieved, the earl agrees to Ceddie's plea to reconcile with his mother.

==Critical reception==
Frank S. Nugent reviewed the film for the ''[[New York Times]]'' on April 3, 1936: "There is a benign aura about the photoplay, a mellow haze of things long past which should lull even the most adamant anti-Fauntlerite into a state of restful receptivity. This may be due to the period settings which have been contrived so handsomely, or to the performance of a perfectly attuned cast, or to Hugh Walpole's adaptation, or to John Cromwell's sentient direction. Whatever the cause, and it probably was the combination of all four, the picture has a way with it and, unless we are very much in error, you will be pleased."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=9E0CE7D7123FEE3BBC4B53DFB266838D629EDE|title=Little Lord Fauntleroy, a Pleasant Film Version of the Familiar Novel, at the Music Hall|accessdate=2009-01-28|author=Frank S.
