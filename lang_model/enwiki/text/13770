The '''1946 New Zealand general election''' was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the [[Parliament of New Zealand]]'s [[28th New Zealand Parliament|28th term]]. It saw the governing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] re-elected, but by a substantially narrower margin than in the three previous elections. The [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] continued its gradual rise.

==Background==
The [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] had been in government since winning the [[New Zealand general election, 1935|1935 elections]], and had been re-elected twice. However, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] had managed to overcome the internal problems which had once troubled it, and now presented a credible threat to Labour. National's leader, [[Sidney Holland]], was proving more effective than his predecessor, while the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]], [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]], was weary and in poor health. The after-effects of [[World War II]], including ongoing shortages, were having an impact on the government's popularity.

The next [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|census]] was scheduled for 1946, but the government brought it forward to September 1945, so that the results could be used for the 1946 electoral redistribution prior to the planned 1946 election.<ref>{{cite web |title=Politics brought the 1946 Census forward to 1945 |url= http://www.statisticsnz.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/intro-to-nz-census/history/did-you-know/politics-affected-1946-census.aspx |publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]] |accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref> The 1946 electoral redistribution had to take ten years of population growth and movements into account. The [[North Island]] gained a further two electorates from the [[South Island]] due to faster population growth. The abolition of the [[country quota]] through the ''Electoral Amendment Act, 1945'' reduced the number and increased the size of rural electorates. None of the existing electorates remained unchanged, 26 electorates were abolished, 19 electorates were created for the first time, and six former electorates were re-established.{{sfn|McRobie|1989|pp=91<U+2013>96}}

==The election==
The date for the main 1946 elections was 27 November, a Wednesday. Elections to the four [[M<U+0101>ori electorates]] were held the day before. 1,081,898 people were registered to vote, and there was a [[voter turnout|turnout]] of 93.5%. This turnout was the highest ever recorded at this point. The number of seats being contested was 80, a number which had been fixed since 1902.<ref name="General elections 1853-2005">{{cite web|title=General elections 1853-2005 - dates & turnout |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/elections/resultsdata/elections-dates-turnout.html |publisher=Elections New Zealand|accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref>

The outcome of the election was probably affected by the abolition of the country quota the previous year.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} This had required rural electorates to be smaller than urban electorates, thus increasing the importance of the rural vote. Since National was more popular than Labour in rural areas, the change may have cost National the election.

==Election results==

===Party standings===
The 1946 election saw the governing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] retain office by a four-seat margin, winning forty-two seats to the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]'s thirty-eight. In the popular vote &mdash; Labour won 51.3% and National won 48.4%. No other parties won any significant share of the vote, and no independents were elected &mdash; only 0.3% of voters did not support one of the two major parties. After [[Harry Atmore]] of Nelson died, no candidate who was not from the two main parties managed to enter Parliament until the [[New Zealand general election, 1966|1966 elections]], when the [[Social Credit Party (New Zealand)|Social Credit Party]] won its first seat.
