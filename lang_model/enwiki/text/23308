'''Elizabeth Stamatina''' "'''Tina'''" '''Fey''' (born May 18, 1970) is an American actress, writer, [[comedienne]], and [[Television producer|producer]]. She has received six [[Emmy Awards]], three [[Golden Globe Awards]], three [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and four [[Writers Guild of America Awards]]. She was singled out as the performer who had the greatest impact on culture and entertainment in 2008 by the [[Associated Press]], who gave her their AP Entertainer of the Year award.<ref name="abc news" />

After graduating from the [[University of Virginia]] in 1992, Fey moved to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to take classes at the improvisational comedy group [[The Second City]], where she became a featured player in 1994. Three years later, Fey became a writer for the sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''). She was promoted to the position of [[head writer]] in 1999. The following year, Fey was added to the cast of ''SNL''. During her time there, she was co-anchor of the show's ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment. After leaving ''SNL'' in 2006, she created her own television series called ''[[30 Rock]]'', a situation comedy loosely based on her experiences at ''SNL''. In the series, Fey portrays the head writer of a fictional sketch comedy series.

In 2004, Fey made her film debut as writer and co-star of the teen comedy ''[[Mean Girls]]''. In 2008, she starred in the comedy film ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'', alongside [[Amy Poehler]]. The following year, Fey won an Emmy Award for her satirical portrayal of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] vice presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] in a guest appearance on ''SNL''.

==Early life==

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduating from the University of Virginia, Fey originally had plans to do graduate work in drama at [[DePaul University]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]], but "I just got this feeling like it wasn't going to work out&nbsp;...

It was all about blind focus. I was so sure that I was doing exactly what I'd been put on this earth to do, and I would have done anything to make it onto that stage. Not because of ''SNL'', but because I wanted to devote my life to [[improvisation|improv]]. I would have been perfectly happy to stay at Second City forever."<ref name="believerint"/>

In 1994, she joined the cast of The Second City, where she performed eight shows a week, for two years.<ref name="believerint" /> She was also in the [[revue]]s ''Citizen Gates'' (1996)<ref name="wsj"/> and ''Paradigm Lost'' (1997),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mobile.suntimes.com/suntimes/db_9562/contentdetail.htm%3Bjsessionid=F78D0B835912E324CF5C828C189F4A17?contentguid=ltZq3XfP&full=true|title=Tina Fey borrows from Chicago in '30'|last=Jevens|first=Darel|date=2008-11-06|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref> where she performed alongside [[Scott Adsit]], Kevin Dorff, [[Rachel Dratch]], Jenna Jolovitz, and [[Jim Zulevic]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=Darel|last=Jevens|title=Second City Makes Another Splash With 'Citizen Gates'|date=1996-05-22|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|page=42}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Tom|lsat=Valeo|title=Second City dreams up an original|date=1997-04-18|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)]]|page=24}}</ref> Improvisation became an important influence on her initial understanding of what it means to be an actress, as she noted in an interview for ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'' in November 2003:<ref name="believerint"/>
{{quote|When I started, improv had the biggest impact on my acting. I studied the usual acting methods at college <U+2013> Stanislavsky and whatnot. But none of it really clicked for me. My problem with the traditional acting method was that I never understood what you were supposed to be thinking about when you're onstage. But at Second City, I learned that your focus should be entirely on your partner. You take what they're giving you and use it to build a scene. That opened it up for me. Suddenly it all made sense. It's about your partner. Not what you're going to say, not finding the perfect mannerisms or tics for your character, not what you're going to eat later. Improv helped to distract me from my usual stage bullshit and put my focus somewhere else so that I could stop acting. I guess that's what method acting is supposed to accomplish anyway. It distracts you so that your body and emotions can work freely. Improv is just a version of method acting that works for me.}}

While in Chicago, Fey also made what she later described as an "amateurish" attempt at [[stand-up comedy]].<ref name="avclub">{{Cite web | first= Noel |last=Murray| title = Interviews: Tina Fey | accessdate = 2007-11-17 | date = 2006-11-01 | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/54729 |work=[[The A.V.

Fey has a scar a few inches long on the left side of her chin and cheek. Responding to questions about its origin, Fey was quoted in the November 25, 2001, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article as saying: "It's a childhood injury that was kind of grim. And it kind of bums my parents out for me to talk about it".<ref name="witchel"/> But in an interview with Fey and Richmond in the January 2009 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Richmond revealed the scar resulted from a slashing incident, which happened when she was five.
