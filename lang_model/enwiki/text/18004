'''Akechi Mitsuhide''' (<U+660E><U+667A> <U+5149><U+79C0> ''Akechi Mitsuhide'', [[1528]]? &ndash; [[July 2]], [[1582]] Japanese calendar 6th month 13th day), nicknamed '''J<U+016B>bei''', was a [[samurai]] who lived during the [[Sengoku period]] of [[Feudal Japan|Feudal]] [[Japan]].

Mitsuhide was a general under [[daimyo]] [[Oda Nobunaga]], although he later betrayed Nobunaga and caused him to commit [[seppuku]].

Born in [[Mino province]] (now [[Gifu prefecture]]) as a descendant of the [[shugo]] [[Toki clan]], Mitsuhide began serving Nobunaga after Nobunaga's conquest of Mino province in [[1566]] and received [[Sakamoto]] (in [[Omi]], 100,000 [[koku]]) in [[1571]]. Although Nobunaga rarely put too much trust in his retainers, he particularly trusted [[Katsuie Shibata]], [[Hideyoshi Hashiba]] and Mitsuhide Akechi. After Mitsuhide received Sakamoto he moved to pacify the Tamba region by defeating several clans such as the Isshiki of Tango.

In [[1579]], he captured [[Yakami Castle]] from [[Hatano Hideharu]] by promising Hideharu peace terms. This accomplished Mitsuhide's goal, although Nobunaga betrayed the peace agreement and had Hideharu executed. Naturally this did not make the [[Hatano clan|Hatano family]] happy and a short while later several of Hideharu's retainers murdered Akechi Mitsuhide's mother.  The situation was fueled through several public insults Nobunaga had directed at Mitsuhide, that even drew the attention of some Western observers.  Mitsuhide blamed Nobunaga for his mother's death and the [[Incident at Honn<U+014D>ji|attack at Honn<U+014D>ji]] on [[June 21]], [[1582]] (Japanese: 6th month 2nd day) Mitushide exacted his revenge. 

He has been credited with killing Oda Nobunaga; while Mitsuhide did not execute Nobunaga personally, he did force him to commit seppuku for his betrayal and subsequent murder of Mitsuhide's mother.  When they found out about the assassination, both [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] rushed to be the first to avenge Nobunaga and take his place. Hideyoshi got to Mitsuhide first, and Mitsuhide's allies such as [[Hosokawa Fujitaka]], who was related to Mitsuhide through a marriage, betrayed him.  Mitsuhide survived for 13 days, until he was defeated by Hideyoshi at the [[Battle of Yamazaki]]. Mitsuhide is rumored to have been killed by a peasant warrior with a bamboo spear by the name of [[Nakamura (Bandit)|Nakamura]] (some say such an ignominious death was but karmic reward for killing his lord). However, there were also rumors that he was not killed, but rather started a new life as a priest called Tenkai.

The Akechi family was able to trace their heritage to the [[Toki]] and from there to the [[Minamoto]].

==Akechi Mitsuhide in fiction==
Akechi Mitsuhide is featured in various fictional works, mostly as a hero, since Oda Nobunaga himself is often portrayed as a villain. He is featured in [[Capcom]]'s [[Onimusha]] as Samanosuke's uncle/relative, as well as [[Onimusha Tactics]] as a playable character. Mitsuhide is also one of the playable characters in [[Koei]]'s [[Samurai Warriors (video game)|Samurai Warriors]]. He wields a katana and is portrayed to have a very close relationship with [[Ranmaru Mori]]. He is voiced by [[Hikaru Midorikawa]] in the Japanese version, and [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] in the English version. He is also featured as a playable character in [[Sengoku Basara]], whereas instead of being a good guy, he is portrayed as a sadistic psychopath who wields dual scythes, and enjoys killing his opponents. For some reason, he is able to attack his allies without damaging them. He is voiced by [[Sho Hayami]] in the said game. In [[Devil Kings]] his name is changed into Reaper, but he becomes unplayable. 

In ''[[Hikaru no Go]]'' a character named Yuki Mitani plays as Mitsuhide in a school play.
