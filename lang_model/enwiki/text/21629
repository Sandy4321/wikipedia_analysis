''Belostoma flumineum'' is commonly known as the Giant Waterbug.  Due to its large size they are a common predator in ponds and wetlands. What makes this species interesting is that they are  one of the few species in the animal kingdom that exhibits exclusive post copulatory [[paternal care]].<ref name="Gilgetall2003">Gilg, M.R., Kruse, K.C. (2003). Reproduction Decreases Life Span in the Giant Waterbug (''Belostoma <U+FB02>umineum''). The American Midland Naturalist, 149, 306-319.</ref> Exclusive paternal care has been the focus of many studies done on this species.  Also studies have been done on [[food webs]] and predation pressure using this species because they are an apex predator in their preferred habitats.        
== Morphology ==
Ovoid-elongate in body shape that is dorsoventrally flattened and brown in coloration.  They can range between 20-25 cm in length.<ref name="Arnett">Arnett, R.H. (2000). American Insects: A Handbook of the Insects of America North of Mexico. CRC press, 2, 284.</ref>  ''B.flumineum'' are insects so naturally have six legs although the front two are strong [[raptorial]] legs for catching and holding prey in a vice grip.<ref name="Otoole2009">O<U+2019>Toole, C. (2009). Belostomatinae. In The New Encyclopedia of Insects and their Allies. Oxford University Press Print, 3,??-??.</ref>  The other four legs are slightly flattened and used for swimming.  The mouth parts consist of a stout syringe-like rostrum or beak and long piercing stylets that were once [[mandibles]] and [[maxillae]].<ref name="Otoole2009" />  They also have retractable strap like appendages that allow for snorkeling while under water which are located on the posterier end of the [[abdomen]].<ref name="Otoole2009" />  They have large eyes but lack oceli which are light detecting sensory organs.<ref name="Otoole2009" />            
== Habitat and Ecology  ==
''Belostoma flumineum'' are commonly found in wetlands, marshes and ponds throughout [[North America]]. They live among weeds and like ponds with muddy bottoms which are good for over wintering in.<ref name="Arnett" />  Common species that ''B. flumineum'' prey upon are back-swimmers, water-boatmen, dragonfly [[nymphs]], and univalve [[snails]]. <ref name="Severin"> Severin, H. P., & Severin, H. C. (1911). Habits of ''Belostoma'' (=Zaitha) ''flumineum'' Say and ''Nepa apiculata'' Uhler, with Observations on Other Closely Related Aquatic Hemiptera. Journal Of The New York Entomological Society, (2), 99.</ref>  While they do not regularly participate in [[cannibalism]] they will attack smaller individuals of the same species.<ref name="Severin" />  [[Reproduction]] in this species has 2 phases, a fall cycle and a spring cycle, where in the fall they are young breeders and in spring they are over wintered adults.<ref name="Kight2000" />
== Paternal Care ==
''Belostoma flumineum'' females lay their eggs on the backs of their mates and from this point onward it is the males job to care for them until they hatch in 7-14 days.<ref name="Gilgetall2003" /> Males can carry up to 100 eggs on their backs at once.<ref name="Crowl1988">Crowl, T.A., Alexander Jr, J.E. (1988). Parental care and foraging ability in male water bugs (''Belostoma flumineum''). Canadian Journal of Zoology, 67, 513-515.</ref>  Males care for their eggs by making sure the eggs get enough oxygen and protection from predators.  Since the eggs are so large they can not stay submerged underwater and use [[diffusion]] to absorb oxygen available in the water.<ref name="Tallomy2001">Tallamy, D.W. (2001). Evolution of Exclusive Paternal Care in Arthropods. Annu. Rev. Entomol, 46,139<U+2013>65.</ref>  The Males must remain at the air-water interface so that the eggs are provided with enough oxygen, this behavior is called air brooding.<ref name="Tallomy2001" />  Brood pumping and brood stroking are another behaviour males do to increase the water flow over the eggs for better oxygen access.<ref name="Tallomy2001" />  Even though males care for the eggs they will still discard them depending on the egg pad size, age of the male and the presence of females.<ref name="Kight2011">Kight, S.L., Tanner, A.W., Coffey, G.L. (2011). Termination of Parental Care in Male Giant Waterbugs, ''Belostoma flumineum'' Say (Heteroptera: Belostomatidae) is Associated with Breeding Season, Egg Pad Size, and Presence of Females. Invertebrate Reproduction & Development, 55, 197-204.</ref>  It has also been found that Males with small egg pads have a temperature dependent discard rate because cooler temperatures mark the end of breeding season so at cool temperature they are less likely to discard a small egg pad compared to warmer temperatures.<ref name="Kight2000">Kight, S.L, Batino, M., Zhang, Z. (2000). Temperature-Dependent Parental Investment in the Giant Waterbug ''Belostoma flumineum'' (Heteroptera: Belostomatidae). Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 93, 340-342.</ref>   
    
== Research == 
As mentioned before there have been a number of studies done using this species of water bug.  Food web and habitat studies such as Tarr and Babbit, used ''B. flumineum'' as the predation pressure for tadpoles and observed the difference between vegetated areas and non vegetated ares when looking at the survival rate of tadpoles.  They found that the tadpoles survived better in highly vegetated area even though those areas tended to have more predators in them.<ref name="Tarr2002">Tarr, T.L., Babbit, K.J. (2002). Effects of habitat complexity and predator identity on predation of Rana clamitans larvae. Amphibia-Reptilia, 23,13-20.</ref>  Chase Also used ''B. flumineum'' as a predation pressure on snails to see if they would change their susceptibility though [[ontogeny]].<ref name="chase1999">Chase, J.M. (1999). To Grow or to Reproduce? The Role of Life-History Plasticity in Food Web Dynamics. The American Naturalist. 154, 571-586.</ref>  Another study was done  using ''B. flumineum'' as a stress inducer on amphibians to see if that would make them more susceptible to disease and <ref name="Haislip2012">Haislip, N.A., Hoverman, J.T., Miller, D.L., and Gray, M.J. (2012). Natural Stressors and Disease Risk: Does the Threat of Predation Increase Amphibian Susceptibility to Ranavirus?. Canadian Journal of Zoolology, 90, 893-902.</ref> The other main area of research done using this species was on factors that influence paternal care.  Crowl and Alexander studied the potential costs of males brooding, specifically if brooding effected their ability to forage for food.  They did get results that suggested that brooding males could not catch faster prey such as small fish as well as females or non brooding males could and thus it does have a foraging effect.<ref name="Crowl1988" />  Gilg and Kruse wanted to test if reproduction decreased life span and they chose ''B. flumineum'' because both the female and male have relatively high costs of reproduction.  The females require a lot of energy to make such large eggs and then the males spend energy brooding eggs and are more exposed to predators.  They did find statistically significant differences between the life spans of virgin and breeding in both males and females.<ref name="Gilgetall2003" />  Those are just the main areas of research done on or using this species of insect there are still other possibilities for future research.
