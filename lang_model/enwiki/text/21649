According to Batley, Sarah relies on people too much for support and was "man-crazy" in her early years. Sarah's final storyline is her death in a skydiving accident, which was a first for a British soap opera. The storyline aired in the second series of ''[[Hollyoaks Later]]'' and was devised by producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]].

==Development==

===Craig's affair===
In 2007, Sarah discovered fianc<U+00E9> [[Craig Dean]]'s ([[Guy Burnet]]) affair with best friend [[John Paul McQueen]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]), in the storyline dubbed "McDean". The storyline reached its climax as the truth is revealed "dramatically" at her engagement party.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hollyoaks actor returning to soap?|url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/Hollyoaks-actor-returning-soap/article-186229-detail/article.html|work=[[Gloucestershire Echo]]|publisher=([[Northcliffe Media]])|accessdate=2011-03-02|date=10 June 2008<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wszrlgTw|archivedate=2 March 2011 -->}}</ref> Sarah walked in on the pair kissing, A ''Hollyoaks'' spokesperson stated in an interview with ''Digital Spy'', "John Paul's sick of all the lies and decides enough is enough.

Craig more so, though. He absolutely destroyed her happiness and belief in men. Her relationship with Craig was going to be her life and she put so much effort into it, emotionally and physically, and it completely destroyed her."<ref name="final"/> Batley said Sarah could not handle the fact he cheated on her with another man. She opined this was the reason her storyline with Zoe and Lydia worked well.<ref name="final"/> However John Paul's betrayal also had impact on Sarah's life because he was one of her best friends. Batley said: "John Paul was her confidante and she thought they were best friends - it's hard to say which part made more of an impact on her. It was all just one horrible experience. It was the betrayal from both of them."<ref name="final"/>

===Sexuality===
{{Quote_box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote="At first I thought it was crazy because Sarah hops from boy to boy and has always been man-crazy.

Sexuality continued to be a focal point in Sarah's storyline. The new plot featured Sarah questioning her sexuality after a one-night-stand with Zo<U+00EB>. Speaking to ''Digital Spy'', Batley said Sarah and Zoe always been close. Zoe is the best friend she has ever had because in her life people have always let her down, whereas Zoe has been "her rock"; despite their fall outs.<ref name=fhs/> Batley felt this to be the reason why they share a mutual friendly love for one another. In comparison, Sarah's feeling intensified and Batley commented: "For Sarah it's something more - she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well."<ref name=fhs>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a179996/hollyoaks-duo-reflect-on-lesbian-plot.html|title='Hollyoaks' duo reflect on lesbian plot|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref> Whilst filming the raunchy scenes, there was a nervous atmosphere on set.<ref name=fdshh>{{cite web|last=Bolger|first=Keeley|title=Sexy star feared lesbian kiss|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/article2086125.ece|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=([[News International]])|accessdate=2011-03-02|date=1 January 2009<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wsxNRXr4|archivedate=2 March 2011 -->}}</ref>

Sarah then embarked on her first full relationship with a woman, with Lydia. The pair have a series of "misunderstandings" until Sarah admits her feelings for Lydia and comes out.<ref name=comout/> Batley spoke of the storyline during an interview with ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' branding her relationship with Lydia as serious compared to her fling with Zoe.<ref name="weird">{{cite web|last=Sam-Daliri|first=Nadia|title=Loui: Lesbian role was 'weird'|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/2655206/Loui-Batley-says-lesbian-scenes-were-weird.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=([[News International]])|accessdate=2011-01-07|date=25 September 2009<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vZENDqid|archivedate=18 December 2010 -->}}</ref> The rocky relationship led to Lydia being jealous of Sarah and Zo<U+00EB>'s friendship, and eventually Sarah's death within the show.

When asked if she thought Sarah had come to terms with the fact she is a lesbian, Batley said: "I don't know because from the beginning, Sarah was always boy crazy, so for her, I don't think it's about being one way or the other <U+2014> I think she's just very clingy.<ref name="f"/> Batley also gave her views on how Sarah should have to developed, opining it would have been good for her to spend more time on her own, be herself and learn who she really is. She felt that Sarah had to often clung on to people and believing that ultimately it would make her happy. Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though. Maybe she was more bisexual than anything."<ref name="f">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/interviews/a179312/loui-batley-and-zoe-lister-hollyoaks-later.html|title=Loui Batley and Zo<U+00EB> Lister ('Hollyoaks Later')|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M<U+00E9>dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]] |first=Kris|last=Green|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=2009-11-02}}</ref>
