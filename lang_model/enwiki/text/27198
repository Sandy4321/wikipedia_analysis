The '''Togo women's national football team''' is a [[FIFA]]-recognised team that represents [[Togo]] in international football competition. Togo have played five FIFA-recognised matches, all in 2006, and are currently [[FIFA Women's World Rankings|unranked]]. They have not competed in major regional and international tournaments. While the country has under-17 and under-20 national sides, further development of the team and the sport in Togo faces challenges common to African countries, as well as country-specific problems such as the sport's lack of domestic popularity.
