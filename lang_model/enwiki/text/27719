==Route Description==
===Fayette County===
US 119 enters [[Pennsylvania]] from [[Monongalia County, WV]] just south of [[Point Marion, PA]].  Known as [[Morgantown, WV|Morgantown]] Rd. for most of its route south of [[Uniontown, PA|Uniontown]], it travels north through Point Marion.  The highway leaves the [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] upon crossing the [[Cheat River]] at its [[confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the [[Monongahela River]].  Route 119 then turns toward the east-northeast and heads toward [[Smithfield, PA|Smithfield]].  To the northeast of Smithfield, Morgantown Rd. intersects with Big Six Rd., which provides access to [[PA 43]] at exit 8.  This begins a section of the highway that runs parallel to two other highways, PA 43 and [[PA 857]], till their termini at the Uniontown bypass in [[South Union Township, PA|South Union Township]].

US 119 merges with [[US 40 (PA)|US 40]] to form part of the [[George C. Marshall]] Parkway, which bypasses the [[city]] of Uniontown to the west and north.  Exits along the US 119 section of the bypass include Walnut Hill Rd.; [[McClellandtown, Pennsylvania|McClellandtown]] Rd. ([[PA 21]]); Main St. (US 40 West and US 40 Bus), the north end of concurrency with US 40; [[Pittsburgh]] St. ([[PA 51]]); N. Gallatin Ave.; and [[Connellsville, PA|Connellsville]] Rd.  Shortly after the Connellsville Rd. exit, US 119 passes [[Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus]].

Eleven miles northeast of Uniontown and six miles north of Penn State, US 119 enters the city of Connellsville.  Route 119 becomes a [[one-way pair]] of 8th and 9th Sts. in western Connellsville. After intersection [[PA 201]]/[[PA 711]] (W. Crawford Ave.), US 119 crosses the [[Youghiogheny River]] via the Memorial Bridge, one of two bridges in Connellsville.  The highway leaves Connellsville as Memorial Blvd and heads to the north intersecting with the southern terminus of [[PA 982]] (Pleasant Valley Rd.).

North of Pleasant Valley Rd. is a [[trumpet interchange]] with [[Everson, PA|Everson]] Valley Rd.  Just north of this intersection, US 119 leaves Fayette County.  US 119 spends 38 miles in Fayette County.<ref>{{cite map|title=US 119 in Fayette County|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=Morgantown+Rd%2FUS-119&daddr=40.112739,-79.555779&hl=en&geocode=FUIXXgId2qc8-w%3B&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=13&sll=40.084639,-79.542046&sspn=0.099422,0.153809&ie=UTF8&ll=39.965543,-79.749756&spn=0.796759,1.230469&z=10|accessdate=2008-10-17|publisher=Google Maps}}</ref>

===Westmoreland County===
The highway enters [[Westmoreland County, PA|Westmoreland County]] in [[East Huntingdon Township, PA|East Huntingdon Township]].  US 119 continues north between the boroughs of [[Scottdale, PA|Scottdale]] and [[Mount Pleasant, PA|Mount Pleasant]].  East of Scottdale, US 119 has an exit with [[PA 819]] signed for the two communities, and then west of Mount Pleasant is an interchange with [[PA 31]], which also provides access to [[PA 981]].  

Five and a half miles north of Mount Pleasant, just west of [[Youngwood, PA|Youngwood]], US 119 traffic must exit the expressway at a full [[cloverleaf interchange]] with the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], [[I-70 (PA)|I-70]] West, and [[PA 66]] North.  After leaving the expressway, US 119 enters Youngwood as Hellman St., which becomes the one-way pair of 3rd and 4th Sts.

Shortly after leaving Youngwood, US 119 intersects the [[Lincoln Highway]] ([[US 30 (PA)|US 30]]), which bypasses [[Greensburg, PA|Greensburg]] to the west and south.  Route 119 becomes Main St. at this point and travels through [[downtown]] Greensburg.  At [[PA 130]], Pittsburgh St., US 119 turns to the right and leaves Greensburg as Harvey Ave and heads to the northeast toward the historical [[Hannastown, Pennsylvania|Hannastown]].  Once leaving Greensburg US 119 becomes predominantly a two-lane road again for the first time since joining the Uniontown bypass nearly 40 miles south.

After passing Hannastown, US 119 continues to the northeast to merge with the [[William Penn Highway]]] ([[US 22 (PA)]]).  The concurrency runs to the east-northeast toward [[Blairsville, PA|Blairsville]] where US 119 leaves Westmoreland County after spending 35 miles in the county.<ref>{{cite map|title=US 119 in Westmoreland County|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=US-119%2FUS-22&daddr=US-119+to:US-119+to:40.112509,-79.55477&hl=en&geocode=FTwIaQId_GdG-w%3BFXl_ZwIdxsxC-w%3BFS5QZgIdSuJB-w%3B&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=3&sz=16&via=1,2&sll=40.109572,-79.549899&sspn=0.012423,0.019226&ie=UTF8&ll=40.301523,-79.409866&spn=0.396417,0.615234&z=11|accessdate=2008-10-17|publisher=Google Maps}}</ref>

===Indiana County===
US 119 enters [[Indiana County, PA|Indiana County]] in the borough of [[Blairsville, PA|Blairsville]] after crossing the [[Conemaugh River]].  US 119/US 22 bypasses the borough to the north and heads to the end of the concurrency in [[Burrell Township, IN County, Pennsylvania|Burrell Township]].  US 119 now takes a more northerly path as the [[Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway]].

Seven miles north of the William Penn Highway, US 119 enters [[Homer City, PA|Homer City]], merges with [[PA 56]] and becomes a four-lane road again north of the borough after being a two-lane road for nearly 30 miles.  PA 56 leaves US 119 when the highway intersects the [[Benjamin Franklin Highway]] ([[US 422]]) south of [[Indiana, PA|Indiana]].  US 119 then becomes an eastern bypass of the borough.  The only exit on the bypass is the Philadelphia St. exit at [[PA 286]].

Immediately after passing Indiana, the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway becomes a two-lane road again north of an interchange with [[PA 110]] and continues to [[Home, PA|Home]].  In Home, US 119 is the eastern terminus of PA 85.  US 119 the continues north through rural northern Indiana County before leaving the county in [[North Mahoning Township, PA|North Mahoning Township]] after travelling 86 miles in the county.<ref>{{cite map|title=US 119 in Indiana County|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=40.437933,-79.272194&daddr=Route+119%2FUS-119&hl=en&geocode=%3BFUg6cAIdj4VK-w&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=0&sz=14&sll=40.427153,-79.25786&sspn=0.04946,0.076904&ie=UTF8&ll=40.710833,-79.153748&spn=0.788006,1.230469&z=10|accessdate=2008-10-17|publisher=Google Maps}}</ref>

===Jefferson and Clearfield Counties===
US 119 enters [[Jefferson County, PA|Jefferson County]] in [[Young Township, Jefferson County, PA|Young Township]].  Just north of the Jefferson County border, US 119 intersects [[PA 436]].  After entering [[Punxsutawney]], the home of [[Punxsutawney Phil]], the route merges with [[PA 36]] at Mahoning St. US 119 is concurrent with PA 36 for four blocks before making a left turn on Hampton Ave.  Route 119 leaves Punxsatawney shortly thereafter as Ridge Ave. and heads east toward [[Big Run, Jefferson County, PA|Big Run]].  Before reaching Big Run, US 119 passes the Punxsutawney Municipal Airport in [[Bell Township, Jefferson County, PA|Bell Township]].  After passing through Big Run as Main St., the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway turns to the north-northeast toward [[Sykesville, PA]].  

Shortly after leaving Sykesville, US 119 leaves Jefferson County and enters [[Clearfield County, PA|Clearfield]] in [[Sandy Township, PA|Sandy Township]] south of [[Dubois, PA|Dubois]].  After an intersection with [[US 322 (PA)|US 322]], US 119 ends at [[US 219 (PA)|US 219]] just south of Dubois.

US 119 spends 18 miles in Jefferson County and less than 3 miles in Clearfield County. <ref>{{cite map|title=US 119 in Jefferson and Clearfield Counties|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=Blinker+Pkwy%2FUS-119&daddr=40.909426,-79.002278&hl=en&geocode=FUwCcwIdogVO-w%3B&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=16&sll=40.90954,-79.000347&sspn=0.012276,0.019226&ie=UTF8&ll=41.002703,-78.884583&spn=0.392273,0.615234&z=11|accessdate=2008-10-17|publisher=Google Maps}}</ref>

==Route History==
U.S. Route 119 was originally signed in 1926.  Until 1927 it ran from West Virginia to [[New York]].  Originally, instead of ending a US 219 in Sandy Township, it followed US 219's current alignment for 44 miles north to [[Wilcox, PA|Wilcox]].  It then followed the present-day [[PA 321]] to [[Kane, PA|Kane]] where it ran concurrent to [[US 6 (PA)|US 6]] to [[Smethport, PA|Smethport]], 26 miles to the northeast.  In Smethport, US 119 travelled the current alignment of [[PA 46]] to [[Bradford, PA|Bradford]] where it turned north to New York via US 219's current alignment.  In 1927, US 119 terminated at its current location south of Dubois.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the highway was widened in several places, the most notable include:  a 1940 widening from New Stanton to Greensburg; a 1948 widening in Connellsville; a 1956 widening in Uniontown.  In 1965, an expressway was completed from [[PA 819]] to PA 31, and in 1966, it was completed from [[Pennsville, PA|Pennsville]] to PA 819.  This expressway runs between Mount Pleasant and Scottdale.

In 1972, the Uniontown (started in 1971) and Indiana (started in 1969) bypasses were completed.  In 1978 an expressway from PA 31 to the PA 66 interchange was completed, which finished the current 11-mile expressway from Pennsville to the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  In 1993 an expressway from the southern end of the Uniontown bypass to Big Six Road in [[Georges Township, PA|Georges Township]] was built parallel to US 119.  This is currently part of PA 43 but is the only free section of the [[Mon-Fayette Expressway]].  In 2000, US 119 was widened along its concurrency with US 22 in Westmoreland County.  Many of the latest improvements have been controversial, but improvements continue to be made. <ref name="pah">{{cite web}}</ref>
