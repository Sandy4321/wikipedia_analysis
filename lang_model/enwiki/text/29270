The '''Family Foundation School''' is a [[private school|private]], [[co-educational]], [[college preparatory school|college preparatory]], [[therapeutic boarding school]] located in [[Hancock, New York|Hancock]], [[New York]].<ref>New York State Department of Education, Administrators Listing for Public and Non-Public Schools and School Districts [http://www.nysed.gov/admin/120906/999098.html]</ref> It was founded in 1984.

==History==
The school was founded in the 1980s by Tony and Betty Argiros, who were recovering [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]s following a [[twelve-step program]]. As a part of their own final step in the program, they took into their home young people who were recovering from substance abuse. They became [[foster parents]] to many of these adolescents and provided some with [[homeschooling]] education. After the number of foster children began to exceed the allowable limit for [[New York State]], they sought and obtained legal status for their home as a licensed school.<ref name=FamilyLight>{{cite web|url=http://www.familylight.com/link3/3.03/3.032/DEF/familyfoundation.htm|title=Profile of The Family Foundation School|publisher=FamilyLight, a service of Thomas J. Croke & Associates, Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref>

Over time, the school grew beyond the Argiros home into a [[campus]] that includes a main school building, boys' and girls' [[dormitory|dormitories]], a chapel, and a barn that houses [[livestock]], in addition to food service, art and athletic facilities.

In 2000, the Argiros children assumed control over the day-to-day operations of the school.<ref name=Argiros1>{{cite web|url=http://thefamilyschoolleadership.com/2009/11/12/an-open-letter-about-sex-at-the-family-foundation-school/ |title=An Open Letter About Sex At The Family Foundation School|publisher=Family Foundation School |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-08|last=Argiros|first=Rita}}</ref>

==Program==
The Family Foundation School program is based upon three core goals: maximize [[Education|academic potential]]; develop [[Spirituality|spiritually]] and [[emotionally]] through a 12-step program of recovery; grow and mature [[psychologically]] through the 12-Step program as well as [[Group therapy|group]] and [[Individual therapy|individual]] therapies. Students at the school are divided into "families" of roughly 30 students and 6 staff members. The family groups eat together, during which time "Table Topics" serve as an opportunity for the group to address any negative issues presented by individual students.<ref name=Woodbury_Visit>{{cite web|url=http://www.strugglingteens.com/artman/publish/FamilyFoundationSchoolVR_071211.shtml|title=Visit Reports: The Family Foundation School|publisher=Woodbury Reports|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref>

==Congressional hearings==
The Family Foundation School was one of several residential programs for special-needs adolescents that were discussed in [[United States Congress]] [[Committee on Education and Labor]] hearings in 2007 and 2008.<ref name=USCCEL>[http://republicans.edlabor.house.gov/hearingsMarkup_details.aspx?NewsID=528 "Child Abuse and Deceptive Marketing by Residential Programs for Teens"], U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor, Full Committee Hearing on HR 5876, April 24, 2008</ref><ref name=NewPaltz>Emily Canty, ''Allegations Against at-risk Youth Programs Made Before Chairman of Committee on Education and Labor'', The New Paltz Oracle, Volume 79 Issue 7, November 1, 2007 [http://oracle.newpaltz.edu/article.cfm?id=3317 ]</ref>
In testimony at an April 24, 2008 committee hearing, a former student testified that during the period 1995 through 1997 members of the school's faculty had engaged in various forms of [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse|verbal abuse]], imposed [[forced labor]], and used inhumane forms of [[physical restraint]].<ref name=JMC-transcript>{{cite web|url=http://edlabor.house.gov/testimony/2008-04-24-JonMartinCrawford.pdf |title=Written transcript of testimony of Jon Martin-Crawford |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> 

The school responded by stating "We will not dispute his testimony. His experiences are his own and will always remain so, regardless of anything anyone says or does. Rather, we wish to unequivocally state: we deeply regret that anyone who has come through our program feels in any way damaged by their experience."  The school also declared support for the efforts of the committee to keep children safe from harm, adding that the school had since modified its crisis-management methods to meet the standards of both the [[New York State Department of Education]] and the [[Therapeutic Crisis Intervention]] (TCI) program developed by [[Cornell University]]. The school also stated that since 1999, all school faculty and staff are required to be trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention techniques.<ref name=FFS-response>The Family Foundation School Responds to the Recent Hearings by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor.

==Activism against==

Since 2007, [[Community Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Youth]] (CAFETY) has conducted an ongoing campaign against the Family Foundation School. In October 2009, a local newspaper reported that CAFETY had sent a letter to residents of [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]], claiming abusive conditions at the school, including excerpts from former student testimonials.  The letter directed residents to an anti-school website for more information about the alleged abusive conditions. Delaware County law enforcement, social services officials, and the school stated that the allegations in letter were based on past issues that had been corrected by the school. CAFETY disputes this claim, saying that its concerns about alleged abuse are based on written complaints by students who attended the school as recently as 2008.<ref name="DailyStar" /> 
CAFETY members have also taken part in rallies in other areas of the country, where experiences at the school were addressed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20091022/ARTICLES/910229884/1002?Title=Rally-for-teens-rights-held-at-downtown-plaza |title=Teen rights rally, Bo Diddley Community Plaza, downtown Gainesville|publisher=Gainesville.com (''The Gainesville Sun'' website)|date=October 22, 2009 |accessdate=2009-10-23|last=Ford|first=Andrew}}</ref>
