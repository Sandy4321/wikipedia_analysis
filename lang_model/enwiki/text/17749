'''Samuel "Sammy" Lee''' (born [[February 7]] [[1959]] in [[Liverpool]]) was a diminutive but skilful midfield player in the great [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] team of the early [[1980s]], who played for [[England national football team|England]] 14 times. He is currently the manager of [[Premier League]] side [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]  following the resignation of [[Sam Allardyce]] on [[April 29]], [[2007]].

==Playing career==

Lee rose through the ranks at [[Anfield]] after joining on an [[apprentice]]ship in September 1975, making his first team debut on [[8 April]] [[1978]] as a 6th minute sub for [[David Johnson (footballer born 1951)|David Johnson]]. [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at [[Anfield]] were the opponents; Lee managed to find the net in the 56th minute of the 3-2 victory. A year earlier he had been put in the squad for a huge [[European Cup]] semi-final and although he didn't play, manager [[Bob Paisley]] said he would have had no qualms about using him if required.

Lee became a regular from 1980 onwards and, although small in stature, he established a reputation as a sharp-passing and strong-running midfield player who could also hit a decent shot.

In the 1981 [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] final, Lee was at the centre of a controversial incident which left opponents [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] feeling slightly cheated. Lee had ventured forwards in an attack and ended up flat out on the turf following a challenge. The West Ham defence pushed out of their area to leave Lee in an obvious [[offside]] position but when Liverpool full back [[Alan Kennedy]] scored with a follow-up shot, the goal stood. The rules about "interfering with play" were still vague back then, and there is no doubt that a similar goal now would also be allowed to stand without complaint. West Ham did equalise but Liverpool won the replay with Lee in the side.

In that year's [[European Cup]] semi-final against [[Bayern Munich]], Lee was unusually asked to do a man-marking job on [[Paul Breitner]], the strong and skilful [[West Germany|West German]] player. It was the first instance Liverpool players recall of worrying at all about an opponent, normally preferring to let the opposition do the worrying, but Lee did the marking job to perfection and Liverpool went through to the final against [[Real Madrid]], which they won 1-0 with Lee again in the side.

Lee got this first [[Football League First Division|League title]] medal in 1982 and also helped Liverpool retain the League Cup; the same applied in 1983 and 1984, the latter of which was also the year of their fourth European Cup triumph - Lee played in every game en route to the final and scored a clinching goal of the 1st leg at [[Anfield]] against [[Dinamo Bucharest]] in the semi-final.

[[Bobby Robson]] gave Lee the first of his 14 [[England national football team|England]] caps during this period, he again scored on his debut in the 3-0 [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] qualifier victory over [[Greece national football team|Greece]] on [[17 November]] 1982.

Injuries took their toll in 1985 and Lee struggled to regain his previous form. With [[Jan M<U+00F8>lby]] in the side, there was no longer a place for Lee at Liverpool. He left during the August of 1986 joining [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]].

Spells at [[CA Osasuna]], [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] followed before he retired from playing.

Lee remains a favourite amongst [[Koppites|Liverpool supporters]] and was included in the 2006 poll [[100 Players Who Shook The Kop]]. Over 110,000 Liverpool fans worldwide voted in the [http://liverpoolfc.tv official Liverpool Football Club web-site]poll for their 100 favourite players of all-time with Lee finishing 47th.

==Coaching career==

His former Liverpool captain, [[Graeme Souness]], invited Lee to join his Anfield coaching staff in 1993 and he did so with relish and respect to the extent that both [[Roy Evans]] and [[G<U+00E9>rard Houllier]] kept him on the payroll after Souness left, gaining promotion from reserve team coach to first team coach under Houllier.

Lee became a part-time coach under [[Sven-G<U+00F6>ran Eriksson]] with England in 2001,<ref>{{cite news

This was to be a role that he would remain in for a year, but in June 2005 he made a return to league football with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton]] as the assistant-[[coach (sports)|manager]] to [[Sam Allardyce]] following the departure of [[Phil Brown (football)|Phil Brown]] to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. In August 2006 he was offered the full-time role of [[England national under-21 football team|England U-21]] [[manager (football)|manager]] (held by [[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] who divides his time between [[Crystal Palace F.C.]] and England), but Lee turned it down; he also stepped down from his [[England national football team|England]] role to concentrate full time on his club commitments with Bolton.<ref>{{cite news
