'''George Weber''' (March 23, 1961<ref name=nypost /> <U+2013> March 20, 2009) was an  [[United States|American]] [[radio personality]] on the [[ABC Radio Network]] doing hourly news updates.  For several years he was on the [[WABC (AM)|WABC 77]] morning show, with [[Curtis Sliwa]] and [[Ron Kuby]] in [[New York City]]. He did periodic news updates throughout the morning, as well as joining in conversation with the hosts about those news stories. He was murdered in his home on March 20, 2009, at the age of 47.

==Career==
Born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], Weber began his radio career at WBUX (AM) in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He then went on to [[WAEB (AM)|WAEB]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], where he worked for two and a half years as a reporter and news anchor. After contacting [[Phil Boyce]], then news director at Denver station [[KIMN]], he received an offer to be a street reporter and anchor with that station. Two and a half years later (after KIMN's demise) Weber went to crosstown rival [[KOA (AM)|KOA]], where he began a new career as the host of a night-time talk show.

Some other important stops on his way to a full-time job with WABC were [[KGO (AM)|KGO]], [[KOGO]], [[KTLK (AM)|KTLK]], and [[KMPC]].<ref name=official >{{cite web

Weber was terminated by WABC at the same time as [[John R. Gambling]] in February 2008. Financial problems at ABC, coupled with the fact that ABC's new morning show ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' had its own newsman, [[Charles McCord]], led to his dismissal.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2008/02/29/2008-02-29_wabc_fires_john_gambling_brings_in_sliwa.html| title=WABC Fires John Gambling|publisher=''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' | first=David | last=Hinckley | date=March 1, 2008}}</ref>  In April 2008, Weber obtained a new assignment doing news updates for the [[ABC Radio Network]].

{{Quotation|Hey it's George Weber, the news guy. For more than a decade, I've been on the airwaves in New York city radio, most of that time at 77 WABC. Currently, I'm a radio anchor at ABC NEWS. I started in broadcasting at the tender young age of 16 at tiny WBUX in Doylestown, Pennyslvania{{sic|?}}. For the next 25 years, I hopscotched the country working at great radio stations like KIMN, KOA and KTLK in Denver, KMPC and KABC in Los Angeles, KGO in San Francisco and KOGO in San Diego. Depending on the day and the year, I was either doing talk radio or news. I love them both.|George Weber|Personal Blog<ref name=plog >

==Personal life==
A number of Weber's stories and investigations were based around experiences in his private life. He often reported about his neighborhood in New York and his two dogs featured in some of his stories. The last story on his website was published on the same day he died, March 20, 2009, and described an outbreak of [[bed bugs]] around his Carroll Gardens neighborhood.<ref name=official /><ref name=window >{{cite newspaper|url=http://content.usatoday.net/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=thejournalnews&sParam=30436109.story|publisher=The Associated Press State & Local Wire|date=2009-03-27|title=Slain newsman's blog a window into Brooklyn life|author=Richard Pyle|quote=Subjects often came from the day's news or other postings on the Internet. Some were commentaries on life in Carroll Gardens, a neighborhood of 19th century brownstone row houses once known for its [[Mafia]] connections and now an upscale area where some people know each other only by their dogs' names ... As one who earned his living speaking proper English, Weber was offended by messages on [[Craigslist]] and other Web sites written in youth [[argot]] he called "ghetto speak." Among examples he cited said on Feb. 1, the "most outlandish" was "a little ditty from a gay kid trying to find another guy to have sex with."}}</ref>

{{Quotation|''Extract from letter to dog Noodles after death of his other dog Romer:''<br>
Don't bite me, Noodles, if I hug you a little more these days or if I squeeze you too tight. That's how humans show how much we love each other and comfort each other in times of grief. And someday when you get old and frail, like Romer, I promise I will be by your side in the autumn of your life. You won't be as playful or agile but you will be wiser in your elder years. You'll be able to reflect on all the things you learned, all the friends you made and most of all, little buddy, you will continue to be my best friend well after you take your last nap. I Love You.

==Death==
On March 20, 2009, George Weber was killed in his [[Brooklyn]] apartment. His colleagues became concerned when he didn't attend work for two days, so in the early morning of March 22, police were dispatched to Weber's apartment. However, they noticed nothing amiss and left.<ref name="nydnGendar ">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/03/23/2009-03-23_george_webers_killer_left_blood_at_wabc_.html|title=George Weber's killer left blood at WABC newsman's home, police say|last=Gendar|first=Alison|coauthors=Jonathan Lemire|date=March 24, 2009|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=New York}}</ref>

Returning several hours later, police entered the apartment and discovered Weber's body, with his hands and feet bound. Weber had been stabbed more than 50 times in the neck, chest and arms, and his apartment had been ransacked.<ref name=nypost>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03222009/news/regionalnews/brooklyn/george_weber_slain_160819.htm|title=George Weber Killed|last=Schram|first=Jamie|coauthors=Rosario, Frank; Celona, Larry|date=2009-03-22|publisher=''New York Post''|accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref><ref name="wcbstv">{{cite news|url=http://wcbstv.com/local/john.katehis.george.2.968347.html|title=Queens Teen Pleads Not Guilty To Weber Murder|last=wcbstv|coauthors=Hazel Sanchez |date=March 26, 2009|work=wcbstv|publisher=CBS Broadcasting Inc.|accessdate=2009-08-31}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Authorities said there was no sign of forced entry at Weber's Carroll Gardens house.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/03/22/2009-03-22_wabc_radio_newsman_george_weber_found_st-2.html|title=WABC radio newsman George Weber found stabbed to death at home |coauthors=David Hinkley, Caitlin Millat, Edgar Sandoval|date=March 23, 2009|work=NY Daily News|publisher=NYDailyNews.com|accessdate=2009-08-31 | location=New York}}</ref>

Katehis allegedly told police that he and Weber had met through a  personal ad Weber had posted on [[Craigslist]].<ref name=craigslist >{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/services/content/metro/stories/2009/04/04/craigslist0404.html?cxtype=ybuzz|publisher=''The Atlanta Journal''|date=2009-04-04|title=Craigslist Ads Linked To Crimes Against Potential Dekalb Buyers|author=Jeffry Scott|page=6B}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://gothamist.com/2009/03/25/teen_murderer_of_radio_newsman_left.php|publisher=''Gothamist''|date=2009-03-25|title=Teen Murderer of Radio Newsman Has Haunting Web Trail|author=Billy Parker|quote=Katehlis has also left extensive material behind on both MySpace and YouTube: In his MySpace profile, he says, "I'm a big risk taker and like to live life on the edge.

He also has photo sets with his knives and swords, posts a fair share of satanic material.}}</ref> This led to the media referring to the accused Katehis as a [[Craigslist killer]].<ref name="advocate033009">
