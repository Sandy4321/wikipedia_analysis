'''Bermuda''' ({{pron-en|b<U+025C>r<U+02C8>mju<U+02D0>d<U+0259>}}; officially, the '''Bermuda Islands''' or the '''Somers Isles''') is a [[British overseas territory]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]]. Located off the [[east coast of the United States]], its nearest [[landmass]] is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], about 1,030 kilometres (640&nbsp;mi) to the west-northwest. It is about 1,373&nbsp;km (853&nbsp;mi) south of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and 1,770&nbsp;km (1,100&nbsp;mi) northeast of [[Miami]], [[Florida]].  Its [[Capital (political)|capital city]] is [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]].

Bermuda is the oldest and most populous remaining British overseas territory, settled by England a century before the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Bermuda's first capital, [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]], was settled in 1612 and is the oldest continuously inhabited English town in the Americas.<ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite web|title=Bermuda - History and Heritage|date=November 6, 2007|publisher=Smithsonian.com|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html|accessdate=December 3, 2008}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Bermuda}}
=== Pre-settlement ===
Bermuda was discovered in 1503 by a Spanish explorer Juan de Bermudez.<ref name="US State Department">{{cite web|title=Bermuda|date=May, 2008|publisher=[[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5375.htm|accessdate=December 3, 2008}}</ref> It is mentioned in ''Legatio Babylonica'', published in 1511 by [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], and was also included on Spanish charts of that year. Both [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ships used the islands as a replenishment spot for fresh meat and water, but legends of [[spirit]]s and devils, now thought to have stemmed only from the callings of raucous birds (most likely the [[Bermuda Petrel]], or ''Cahow''), also the loud noise heard at night from wild hogs and of perpetual, storm-wracked conditions (most early visitors arrived under such conditions) and a surrounding ring of treacherous reefs kept them from attempting any permanent settlement on the '''Isle of Devils'''.

Berm<U+00FA>dez and Gonzalo Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Oviedo ventured to Bermuda in 1515 with the intention of leaving a breeding stock of hogs on the island as a future stock of fresh meat for passing ships. However, the inclement weather prevented them from landing.

Some years later, a Portuguese ship on the way home from [[Santo Domingo]] wedged itself between two rocks on the reef. The crew tried to salvage as much as they could and spent the next four months building a new hull from [[Bermuda cedar]] to return to their initial departure point.

=== Settlement by the English ===
[[Image:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|[[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith]] wrote one of the first [[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles|Histories of Bermuda]] (in concert with [[Virginia]] and [[New England]])]]
For the next century, the island is believed to have been visited frequently but not permanently settled. The first two English colonies in Virginia had failed, and a more determined effort was initiated by King [[James I of England]] (James VI of Scotland), who granted a Royal Charter to the [[Virginia Company]]. In 1609, a [[flotilla]] of ships left England under the Company's Admiral, Sir [[George Somers]], and the new Governor of Jamestown, Sir Thomas Gates, to relieve the colony of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], settled two years before. Somers had previous experience sailing with both Sir [[Francis Drake]] and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. The flotilla was broken up by a storm, and the flagship, the ''[[Sea Venture]]'', was wrecked off Bermuda (as depicted on the territory's [[coat of arms of Bermuda|coat of arms]]), leaving the survivors in possession of a new territory. (William Shakespeare's play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'' is thought to have been inspired by [[William Strachey]]'s account of this shipwreck.) The island was claimed for the English Crown, and the charter of the Virginia Company was extended to include it. St George's was settled in 1612 and made Bermuda's first capital. It is the oldest continually inhabited English town in the [[New World]].<ref name=Smithsonian />

In 1615, the colony was passed to a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]] (''The Somers Isles'' remains an official name for the colony, named after Admiral Somers, just as Gate's Bay and Fort Gates are named after Sir Thomas Gates), formed by the same shareholders. The close ties with Virginia were commemorated even after Bermuda's separation by reference to the archipelago in many Virginian place names, such as [[Hopewell, Virginia|Bermuda City]], and [[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]]. The first British coins in America were struck here.

Most of the survivors of the ''Sea Venture'' had carried on to Jamestown in 1610 aboard two Bermuda-built ships. Among them was [[John Rolfe]], who left a wife and child buried in Bermuda, but in Jamestown would marry [[Pocahontas]], a daughter of [[Chief Powhatan|Powhatan]]. Intentional settlement of Bermuda began with the arrival of the ''Plough'', in 1612.

=== Company colony ===
Because of its limited land area, Bermuda has had difficulty with over-population. In the first two centuries of settlement it relied on steady human emigration to keep the population manageable. It is often claimed that, before the [[American War of Independence|American Revolution]] more than ten thousand Bermudians (over half of the population) emigrated, primarily to the [[Southern United States|American South]], where Great Britain was displacing [[Spain]] as the dominant European imperial power. A steady trickle of outward migration continued. With seafaring being the only real industry, by the end of the 18th century at least a third of the island's manpower was at sea at any one time.

The archipelago's limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the [[New World]]. In 1616 and 1620 acts were passed banning the hunting of certain birds and young tortoises.<ref>Meggs, Martin - Planner (Information Systems, Department of Planning - "Developing a small Island GIS: the Bermuda Experience," Bermuda.</ref>

In 1649, the [[English Civil War]] raged and King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was beheaded in Whitehall, London. The execution resulted in the outbreak of a Bermudian civil war; it was ended by militias. This created a strong sense of devotion to the crown for the majority of colonists and it forced those who would not swear allegiance, such as [[Puritan]]s and independents, into exile in [[the Bahamas]].<ref>Forbes, Keith: [http://www.bermuda-online.org "About Bermuda Online"], The Royal Gazette Ltd. Retrieved September 22, 2007.</ref>
[[Image:Bermuda Gazette - 12 November 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Bermuda Gazette of 12 November 1796, calling for privateering against Spain and its allies, and with advertisements for crew for two privateer vessels.]]
In the 17th century the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding, as it needed Bermudians to farm in order to generate income from the land. Agricultural production met with only limited success, however. The Bermuda cedar boxes used to ship tobacco to England were reportedly worth more than their contents.{{Citation needed|Jan 2008|date=January 2008}} The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the Company's charter in 1684; the Company itself being dissolved.

=== Maritime economy ===
After the dissolution of the Somers Isle Company, Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', also called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the whole island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade that would become the world's largest, and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century.
Bermudian sailors would turn their hands to far more trades than supplying salt, however. Whaling, [[privateering]], and the merchant trade were all pursued vigorously. Vessels would sail the normal shipping routes, but had to engage an enemy vessel no matter the size or strength, and as a result many ships were destroyed.
The [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability. In fact, it was the Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}}, one of the fastest vessels in the [[Royal Navy]], that brought the news of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] back to England.

=== Fortress Bermuda ===
After the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours and built the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|large dockyard]] on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]], in the west of the chain, as its principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes. During the [[War of 1812|American War of 1812]], the British attacks on [[Burning of Washington|Washington, D.C. and the Chesapeake]], that would result in the writing of ''[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]'', were planned and launched from Bermuda, the Royal Navy's 'North American Station'. [[Image:BVRC-Great-War-Contingent 1914.jpg|thumb|The First [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]] Contingent, raised in 1914. By the war's end, the two Bermuda contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength.]]It was here that the British soldiers assembled before being sent to attack [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. In 1816, James Arnold, the son of famed U.S. traitor [[Benedict Arnold]], fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible U.S. attacks.<ref>Howes, James: [http://www.atlascom.us/keys.htm "Attack on Baltimore Launched from Bermuda in 'War of 1812'"] 2005</ref> Today, the [http://www.bmm.bm/ "Maritime Museum"] occupies the [[Keep]] of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artifacts of the base's military history.

As a result of Bermuda's proximity to the southeastern U.S. coast, it was regularly used by [[Confederate States]] [[blockade runners]] during the [[American Civil War]] to evade Union naval vessels and bring desperately needed war goods to the South from England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as a museum open to the public.

=== Economic and political development ===
[[Image:Bermuda harbour 1926.jpg|thumb|Bermuda mid-1920s]]
In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for wealthy American, Canadian and British tourists arriving by frequent steamship service. In addition, the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] enacted by the United States against its trading partners in 1930, cut off Bermuda's once-thriving agricultural export trade (primarily lilies and fresh vegetables to the U.S.), spurring the overseas territory to develop its tourist industry. In the late 1930s, [[Imperial Airways]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] began operating scheduled flying-boat airline services from [[New York City|New York]] and [[Baltimore]] to [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda]]. In 1948, regularly scheduled commercial airline service by land-based airplanes began to [[Kindley Air Force Base|Kindley Field]] (now [[Bermuda International Airport]]), helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s<U+2013>1970s. By the end of the 20th century, international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy (see "Economy", below).

The Royal Naval Dockyard and the attendant military garrison continued to be an important component of Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in [[World War II]], U.S. military installations also were located in Bermuda (see "Military" section, below, and [[Military of Bermuda]]).

Universal adult suffrage and the development of a two-party political system occurred in the 1960s. Before universal suffrage, adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967, voting was based on property ownership (see "Politics" section, below, and [[Politics of Bermuda]]). On March 10, 1973, then-Governor of Bermuda [[Richard Sharples]] was assassinated by local [[Black Power]] militants during a period of civil unrest in the 1970s.

== Geography ==
[[File:Bermuda topographic map-en.png|thumb|250px|Topographic map of Bermuda]]
{{Main|Geography of Bermuda}}
Bermuda is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, near the western edge of the [[Sargasso Sea]], roughly 580 [[nautical miles]] (1070&nbsp;km, 670&nbsp;mi) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras on the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] and roughly 590 nautical miles (1100&nbsp;km, 690&nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. The island lies due east of [[Fripp Island]], [[South Carolina]]. It has 103&nbsp;km (64&nbsp;mi) of coastline. There are two [[Corporation|incorporated]] [[Municipal government|municipalities]] in Bermuda: the [[Hamilton, Bermuda|City of Hamilton]] and the [[St. George, Bermuda|Town of St George]]. Bermuda is divided into various "parishes," in which there are some localities called "villages," such as [[Flatts Village, Bermuda|Flatts Village]], [[Tucker's Town, Bermuda|Tucker's Town]] and [[Somerset, Bermuda|Somerset Village]].

Although usually referred to in the singular, the territory consists of approximately 138 islands, with a total area of 53.3 square kilometres (20.6&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The largest island, ''Main Island,'' is sometimes itself called ''Bermuda.'' Compiling a list of the islands is often complicated, as many have more than one name (as does the entire archipelago, which has also been known historically as ''La Garza'', ''Virgineola'', and the ''Isle of Devils''). Despite its small land mass, there has been a tendency for place names to be repeated; there are, for example, two islands named ''Long Island,'' and ''[[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's Town]]'' is located on ''[[St. George's Island, Bermuda|St George's Island]]'' within ''[[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St George's Parish]]'' (each known as ''St George's'').

== Climate ==
{{Main|Climate of Bermuda}}
Although Bermuda's latitude is similar to that of [[Savannah, Georgia]], it is warmer in winter, and slightly cooler in summer. Its [[humid subtropical climate]]<ref name=climate /><ref>{{cite web|last=Ritter|first= Michael E. |title=The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]]|url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/climate_systems/humid_subtropical.html|accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> is warmed by the nearby [[Gulf Stream]], thanks to the [[westerlies]], which carry warm, humid air eastwards over Bermuda, helping to keep winter temperatures above freezing. The climate is humid and, as a result, the summertime heat index can be high, even though mid-August temperatures rarely exceed 30 <U+00B0>C (86 <U+00B0>F). Winters are mild, with average daytime temperatures in January and February around 20 <U+00B0>C (68 <U+00B0>F), although [[cold front]]s, which dominate the local weather for most of the year, bring Arctic [[air mass]]es that can result in rapid temperature drops. Atlantic winter storms, often associated with these cold fronts, can produce powerful, gusting winds and heavy rain. Factoring in the [[wind chill]], the [[felt air temperature]] in winter can fall below freezing, 0 <U+00B0>C (32 <U+00B0>F), even though the actual temperature rarely drops below 10 <U+00B0>C (50 <U+00B0>F). The lowest recorded temperature in Bermuda as of 2003 is 7.2 <U+00B0>C (45 <U+00B0>F).<ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Summary for January 2003|publisher=[[Bermuda Weather Service]]|date=4 February 2003|url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2003-01.html|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>

Bermuda is very susceptible to [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]]. Its position along the [[Gulf Stream]] means that it is often directly in the path of hurricanes recurving in the [[westerlies]], although they have usually begun to weaken as they approach the island. It is often affected by these hurricanes, although the island's small size means that direct [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] are rare. The last hurricane to cause significant damage to the islands was [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 3]] [[Hurricane Fabian]] on September 5, 2003. Its eastern eyewall hit the territory and four people were killed.

The only source of fresh water in Bermuda is rainfall, which is collected on roofs and catchments (or drawn from underground lenses) and stored in tanks. Each dwelling usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation.

The Constitution of Bermuda came into force on June 1, 1967 and was amended in 1989 and 2003. The head of government is the [[Premier of Bermuda|premier]]. A cabinet is nominated by the premier and appointed officially by the governor. The legislative branch consists of a [[bicameral parliament]] modelled on the [[Westminster system]]. The [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]] is the upper house consisting of eleven members appointed by the governor on the advice of the premier and the leader of the opposition. The [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]], or lower house, has thirty-six members elected by the eligible voting populace in secret ballot to represent geographically defined constituencies. [[Elections in Bermuda|Elections]] must be called at no more than five-year intervals. The [[Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda)|Progressive Labour Party]] won the most recent general election held on December 18, 2007, winning 22 of 36 seats in the House of Assembly.<ref>{{cite web | title=Sweet Victory for Brown as Dunkley Out | publisher=[[The Royal Gazette]] | date=December 19, 2007 | url=http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/index.jsp | accessdate=2007-12-19 }}</ref>

Following his victory over former Premier [[William Alexander Scott|Alex Scott]] at the Progressive Labour Party delegates' conference in October 2006, the current premier is [[Ewart Brown]]. The [[United Bermuda Party]] serves in [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].
The Progressive Labour Party leadership favours independence from the United Kingdom, although polls have indicated that this is not supported by the population. While a referendum in 1995 on independence was defeated by a substantial margin, the [[Bermuda Industrial Union]] and the Progressive Labour Party (then in the Opposition) had called for a boycott of the referendum, having an unquantified impact on the result.

There are few accredited diplomats in Bermuda. The United States maintains the largest diplomatic mission in Bermuda, comprising both the United States Consulate and the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Services at the [[Bermuda International Airport]]. The current U.S. Consul General is Grace Shelton, who replaced [[Gregory W. Slayton]] as the U.S. Chief of Mission in Bermuda in August 2009. Given that the United States is by far Bermuda's largest trading partner (providing over 71% of total imports, 85% of tourist visitors, and an estimated $163 billion of U.S. capital in the Bermuda insurance/re-insurance industry alone, and the fact that an estimated 5% of Bermuda residents are U.S. citizens, which represents 14% of all foreign-born persons), American diplomatic presence is seen as an important element in the Bermuda political landscape.

A [[General Election]] must be held in Bermuda every five years. Following the PLP's re-election in 2007, the next election must be held no later than 2012.

== Parishes and municipalities ==

{{Main|Military of Bermuda}}
[[Image:Rembrance Day Parade Bermuda.jpg|thumb|Remembrance Day Parade, Hamilton, Bermuda]]

Once known as ''the Gibraltar of the West'', the defence of Bermuda remains the responsibility of the British government. Until the [[American Revolutionary War]], following which Bermuda became the Royal Navy's Western Atlantic headquarters, the Bermuda government had maintained [[militia]] for the defence of the colony. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, these militias became superfluous and were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony did raise [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the military garrison.

Due to its strategic location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval and air base (during the [[Second World War]]).

In May 1940, the U.S. requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.</ref> In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the United Kingdom granted the U.S. base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received in exchange. However, one of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the U.S. Army was to build in Bermuda would be used jointly by the U.S. and the U.K. (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5.8&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (2<U+00BC>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi, 1,400 acres) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[U.S. Air Force]] transport and refueling aircraft and by [[U.S. Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Germans|German]] and, later, [[Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the U.S. Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.

The original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a seaplane base until the mid-1960s, became the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex and provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting [[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S. Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size.. An additional U.S. Navy compound known as Naval Facility Bermuda (NAVFAC Bermuda), a [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility. Although leased for 99 years, U.S. forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].

Canada, which had operated a war-time naval base, ''[[HMCS Somers Isles]]'', on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head, in the ''West End'' of the islands during this time.

In the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small [[Royal Navy]] supply base, [[HMS Malabar]], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.
[[Image:HMS Ambuscade in Bermuda.jpg|thumb|[[HMS Ambuscade (F172)|HMS ''Ambuscade'']] at the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]]]]
In both World War I and World War II, Bermudians served in the British armed forces. Amongst the latter was Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest ranking soldier. After the war, he was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and children of Bermudians had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey, who, when promoted to that rank at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.

Today, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription in which balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part time, once they turn eighteen.

== Role in international relations ==
As an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom, Bermuda has no seat in the [[United Nations]] and is represented by the UK in foreign affairs. Bermuda's close proximity to the United States has made it the site of past summit conferences between British Prime Ministers and U.S. Presidents. The first summit was held in December 1953, at the insistence of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], to discuss relations with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Participants at the conference included Churchill, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and French Premier [[Joseph Laniel]]. In 1957, a second summit conference was held; this time British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] arrived earlier than President Eisenhower, to make it clear that they were meeting on British territory, as tensions were still high regarding the previous year's conflict over the [[Suez Canal]]. It was said the two discussed the general situation of the world. Macmillan would return in 1961 for the third summit with President [[John F. Kennedy]], who was familiar with Bermuda, having made numerous personal visits. The meeting was called to discuss [[Cold War]] tensions arising from construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. The most recent summit conference in Bermuda between the two powers occurred in 1971, when British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] met U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Keith Forbes | title= Bermuda's distinguished visitors over the years | publisher=Royal Gazette | url= http://www.bermuda-online.org/specialvisitors.htm | accessdate= 2007-09-22 }}</ref>

Direct meetings between the [[President of the United States]] and the [[Premier of Bermuda]] have been rare. The most recent meeting was held on June 23, 2008, between Premier [[Ewart Brown]] and President [[George W. Bush]].  Prior to this, the leaders of Bermuda and the United States had not met at the White House since a 1996 meeting between Premier David Saul and President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name=rg>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Kent|title=Premier meets the President | url=http://www.royalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?articleId=7d86c3730030004&sectionId=48|work= [[The Royal Gazette]] |publisher= |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

The four men were among 22 Uyghurs who claimed to be refugees, who were captured in 2001 in Pakistan after fleeing the [[American aerial bombardment of Afghanistan]]. They were suspected of training to assist [[Taliban]]'s military. They were cleared as safe for release from Guant<U+00E1>namo in 2005 or 2006. But U.S. domestic law prohibited deporting them back to [[China]], their country of citizenship, because it was deemed by the U.S. government that China was likely to abuse their human rights.

In September 2008 the men were cleared of all suspicion, and Judge Ricardo Urbina in Washington ordered their release. However domestic opposition to their admittance to the United States was very strong,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and, until Bermuda and [[Palau]] agreed to accept them in June 2009, the U.S. had failed to find a home for them.

The secret bilateral discussions leading to the transfer of prisoners between the U.S. and the devolved Bermuda government sparked diplomatic ire from the government of the [[United Kingdom]], which was not consulted on the move despite Bermuda's being a British territory. The British Foreign Office issued the following statement: "We've underlined to the Bermuda Government that they should have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue, for which the Bermuda Government do not have delegated responsibility. We have made clear to the Bermuda Government the need for a security assessment, which we are now helping them to carry out, and we will decide on further steps as appropriate."

[[Image:Bermuda 2006 circulating coins.jpg|thumb|Coins circulating in 2006]]
[[File:Bermudian-dollars-$50.jpg|thumb|Bermudian $50 Banknote]]
Since switching from the [[Bermudian pound]] in 1970, Bermuda's currency has been the [[Bermudian dollar]], which is [[Fixed exchange rate|pegged]] to the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with Bermudian notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy a small exchange rate for the purchase of US dollars with Bermudian dollars.<ref>[http://www.butterfieldbank.bm/Rates/Foreign_Exchange/home.htm] Bank of Butterfield Exchange Rate Page</ref> Bermudian notes carry the image of [[HM Queen Elizabeth II]]. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins, as well as being responsible for the regulation of financial institutions. There is a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins at the Royal Naval Dockyard Museum.

Bermuda's per capita income is approximately 50% higher than that of the United States; according to the Bermuda Government's Economic Statistics Division, Bermuda's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] was $5.85 billion in 2007, or $91,477 per-capita, giving Bermuda the highest GDP per capita in the world.<ref name="Gazette17Dec08" />

The affordability of housing has become a prominent issue over the past few years. The [[CIA]] [[World Factbook]] lists the average cost of a house in June 2003 as $976,000,<ref name="cia" /> while real estate agencies have claimed that this figure had risen to $1.6 million by 2006,<ref>[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?sectionId=60&articleId=7d7151330030077 "Average cost of houses hits $1.6m"], Jonathan Kent, ''The Royal Gazette'', January 10, 2007</ref> and to $1.845 million by early 2007,<ref>[http://www.bermudasun.bm/main.asp?SectionID=24&SubSectionID=270&ArticleID=34741&TM=49374.21 "Average family home now $1.8m"], Meredith Ebbin, ''Bermuda Sun'', August 2, 2007</ref> though such high figures have been disputed.<ref>[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/siftology.royalgazette/Article/article.jsp?sectionId=65&articleId=7d7161330030116 "$1.6m average house price?

Bermuda is an [[offshore financial centre]], which results from its low direct [[taxation]] on personal or corporate income. The local tax system is based upon import duties, payroll taxes and [[consumption tax]]es. The legal system is derived from that of the United Kingdom, with recourse to English courts of final appeal.

As the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy; it is a [[financial export]]er of financial services, primarily [[insurance]], [[reinsurance]], [[investment fund]]s and [[special purpose vehicle]]s (SPV). Finance and international business now constitute the largest sector of Bermuda's economy.<ref name=Smithsonian /> However in September 2009, it was reported that a growing number of companies were moving from Bermuda to Ireland as part of a search for "a more stable environment".<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent.ie |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/world/willis-moves-tax-base-here-ahead-of-us-curbs-1892709.html |title=Willis moves tax base here ahead of US curbs - World, Business |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

Large numbers of leading international insurance companies are based in Bermuda making the territory one of the world's largest reinsurance centres.<ref>[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2006/10/25/73563.htm] Insurance Journal</ref> Those internationally owned and operated businesses that are physically based in Bermuda<U+2014>of which there are around four hundred<U+2014>are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies (ABIC). In total, over 1,500 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the [[Registrar of Companies]] in Bermuda.

Thanks to its favourable tax regime and a highly reactive regulatory framework Bermuda is the domicile of choice for the implementation of insurance-related innovative solutions also known as [[Alternative Risk Transfer]] (ART). ART includes [[captive insurance]]s, [[Finite Risk insurance]] and insurance [[securitisation]] such as [[Cat bonds]].

The [[Bermuda Stock Exchange]] (BSX), established in 1971, is now the world's largest fully electronic offshore securities market, with a current market capitalisation (excluding mutual funds) in excess of US$330 billion{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. There are four hundred securities listed on the stock exchange, of which almost three hundred are offshore funds and alternative investment structures attracted by Bermuda's regulatory environment. The Exchange specialises in listing and trading of capital market instruments such as equities, debt issues, funds (including hedge fund structures) and depository receipt programmes.

The BSX is a full member of the [[World Federation of Exchanges]] and is located in an [[OECD]] member nation. It also has Approved Stock Exchange status under Australia's Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) taxation rules and Designated Investment Exchange status by the UK's Financial Services Authority.

Tourism is Bermuda's second largest industry, with the island attracting over one-half million visitors annually, of whom more than 80% are from the United States. Other significant sources of visitors are from Canada and the United Kingdom. Tourists arrive either by cruise ship or by air at [[Bermuda International Airport]], the only airport on the island.<ref>[http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070111/NEWS/101110129 Tourism in 2006, ''Royal Gazette'', Jan. 11, 2007]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref>

== Education ==
The Bermuda Education Act 1996 requires that only three categories of schools can operate in the Bermuda Education system:

* ''aided school'', has all or a part of its property vested in a body of trustees or board of governors and is partially maintained by public funding or, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, has received a grant-in-aid out of public funds.

* ''maintained school'', has the whole of its property belonging to the Government and is fully maintained by public funds.

* ''private school'', not maintained by public funds and has not, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, received any capital grant-in-aid out of public funds. The private school sector consists of 6 traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys<U+2019> school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s and in 1996, one of the maintained public schools became a private school.

Prior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated and when the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formally maintained "white" schools and both single gender schools opted to become private schools. The rest became part of the public school system and were either aided or maintained.

At present there are 26&nbsp;schools in the Bermuda Public School System, eighteen of which are primary schools, five are middle schools, two senior schools and one special school. There is also an Alternative Programme provided for students with behavioural challenges who cannot function in the public mainstream. There are two aided primary schools, two aided middle schools and one aided senior school.

For higher education, the [[Bermuda College]] offers various [[associate degrees]] and other certificate programmes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bermuda College |url=http://www.bercol.bm/ |accessdate=2008-02-10 }}</ref> Bermuda does not have any four-year colleges or universities.

In May 2009, Bermudian Government's application  was approved to become a contributory member of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI).  Bermuda's membership is slated to allow Bermudian students to enter the University at an agreed upon subsidized rate possibly as early as the 2009/2010 school year.  UWI also agrees that their Open Campus (online degree courses) would become open to Bermudian students in future with Bermuda becoming the 13th country to have access to the Open Campus.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bermuda joins the UWI Family |url=http://cavehill.uwi.edu/news/releases/release.asp?id=132 |accessdate=2009-06-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/article.php?news_id=17279 |title=Bermuda joins UWI |accessdate=2009-07-05 |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2009-06-25 |month=06 |work=CaribbeanNetNews |pages= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

== Sightseeing and attractions ==
[[Image:BDA Bermuda.jpg|thumb|One of Bermuda's pink sand beaches, at Astwood Park]]
Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, [[cerulean]] blue ocean waters are popular with tourists and many of Bermuda's hotels are located along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a designated [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers can explore numerous [[shipwreck|wrecks]] and [[coral reefs]] in relatively shallow water (typically {{convert|30|-|40|ft|0|disp=s|abbr=on}} in depth) with virtually unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by [[snorkelling|snorkellers]], especially at [[Church Bay, Bermuda|Church Bay]].

Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is the Royal Naval Dockyard, which includes the Bermuda Maritime Museum. Other attractions include the [[Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bamz.org |title=Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo |publisher=Bamz.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref> Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens, lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with its impressive [[stalactites]] and underground saltwater pools.

It is not possible to rent a car on the island; however, visitors can hire [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] for use as private transport, or use public transport.

== Arts and culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Bermuda}}
Bermuda's culture is a mixture of the various sources of its population, though little trace remains of the various Native American, Spanish-Caribbean, African, Irish or Scots cultures that would have been evident in the 17th century, with [[Anglo-Saxon]] culture becoming dominant. Today, the only language other than English that is spoken by any substantial part of the population is actually Portuguese, following one hundred and sixty years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]). There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]]. A second wave of immigration from the [[West Indies]] has been sustained throughout the 20th century, although, unlike the Africans who immigrated to that area as indentured servants (or who were imported as slaves) in the 17th century, the more recent arrivals have mostly come from English speaking countries (albeit, most of the West Indian islands whose populations now speak English were then part of the [[Spanish Empire]]). This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[Calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post Second World War aviation. While Calypso music appealed more to the visitors than to the locals, [[Reggae]] has been embraced since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaican]] immigration.
[[Image:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gombey]] dancers in Bermuda]]
Bermuda's literary history was largely limited to non-Bermudian writers commenting on the island. In the 20th century, a large number of books were written and published locally, though few were aimed at a wider market than Bermuda (most of these being scholarly reference books, rather than creative writing). One Bermudian novelist, Brian Burland, has achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally, although the first (and undoubtedly the most important, historically) notable book credited to a Bermudian was the ''History of Mary Prince'', a slave narrative by a Bermudian woman, [[Mary Prince]], which helped to end slavery in the [[British Empire]]. Bermuda's proximity to the United States means that many aspects of US culture are reflected or incorporated into Bermudian culture. Many non-Bermudian writers have also made Bermuda their home, or have had homes here, including [[A.J. Cronin]] and [[F. Van Wyck Mason]], who wrote on Bermudian subjects.

Dance and [[Music of Bermuda|music]] are important in Bermuda. The dances of the colourful ''Gombey Dancers'', seen at many events, were influenced by imported [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[African]] slaves.

Bermuda has produced, or been home, to actors (such as [[Earl Cameron (actor)|Earl Cameron]], [[Diana Dill]], and most famously, [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]). Noted musicians have included local icons [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], who performed for many decades in both Bermuda and The United States (and appearing on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s televised variety show), jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]], pop singer [[Heather Nova]] and more recently dancehall artist [[Collie Buddz]]. In 1979, [[Gina Swainson]] was crowned "[[Miss World]]".

Every year Bermuda hosts an international film festival, which shows many independent films. One of the festival's founders is film producer and director [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], co-founder of the [[Rankin/Bass]] production company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bermudafilmfest.com/ |title=index.html |publisher=Bermudafilmfest.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

Bermuda water colours painted by local artists are sold at various galleries and elaborately hand-carved cedar sculptures are another specialty. One such {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} sculpture created by Bermudian artisan Chesley Trott is on display at the airport's baggage claim area. Local artwork may also be viewed at several galleries around the island. Alfred Birdsey was one of the more famous and talented water colourists, his impressionistic landscapes of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] and the surrounding sailboats, homes, and bays of Bermuda are world-renowned.

Every Easter, Bermudians of all ages build kites, usually of a traditional Bermudian type, which are flown to symbolise Christ's ascent. A [[Bermuda kite|Bermudian kite]] is made to geometric designs, quite colourful, and is an art form as much as a recreational tool. Despite this, Bermudian kites are very airworthy, holding world records for altitude and duration of flight.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Sport is a popular pastime in Bermuda, especially [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[sailing]], [[golf]] and [[rugby union]].

[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a 130&nbsp;kg (290&nbsp;lbs, 20<U+00BD> stone) police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. Bermuda's team holds the world record for conceding the highest number of [[Run (cricket)|runs]] ever in the history of the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]]. They conceded 413 runs in a 50 overs, one-day international, game against India. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], who is a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual "Cup Match" cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and [[Somerset]] in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday.

Bermuda has the world's highest acreage of golf courses as a percentage of its total landmass. In 2007 Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on October 16<U+2013>17, 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season ending tournament is between only four golfers - the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda again in 2008 and 2009.

The Government announced in 2006 that it will provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and [[Bermuda national football team|football]] teams. Bermuda's most prominent footballers include [[Clyde Best]], [[Reggie Lambe]] and [[Shaun Goater]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team in order to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team plays in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]].

[[Sailing]], [[fishing]], and [[equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport<U+2013>Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year old tradition. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |date= |accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

At the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games.  Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, [[Clarence Hill (boxer)|Clarence Hill]], who won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also recently competed in Men's [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] (head first luge) at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. Patrick Singleton placed 19th, with a final time of 1:59.81. Bermuda also competes in the biennial [[International Island Games Association|Island Games]], which it will host in 2013.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Bermuda}}
A July 2005 estimate put Bermuda's population at 65,365. The ethnic makeup of Bermuda is 54.8% black, 34.1% white, and 6.4% [[multiracial]]. The islands have a small but growing Asian community. A significant segment of the population is also of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ancestry (10%), the result of immigration from Portuguese-held islands (especially the [[Azores]]) during the past 160 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~portwestind/diaspora/waves_of_migration.htm |title=The Portuguese of the West Indies |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=2001-07-31 |accessdate=2010-06-20}}</ref>

Some islanders, especially in [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St David's]], trace their ancestry to Native Americans. Hundreds were shipped to Bermuda, possibly from as far as [[Mexico]]. The best known examples were the [[Algonquian peoples]] who were exiled from the [[New England]] colonies and sold into slavery in the 17th century, notably in the aftermaths of the [[Pequot War]], and [[King Philip's War]].

Several thousand [[expatriate]] workers, principally from the UK, Canada, the West Indies, South Africa and the U.S., also reside in Bermuda, primarily engaged in specialised professions such as accounting, finance, and insurance. Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, and landscaping services. Of the total workforce of 38,947 persons in 2005, government employment figures state that 11,223 (29 percent) are non-Bermudians.<ref>Bermuda ''Sun'', April 4, 2007.</ref>

== Fauna ==
The only indigenous [[mammal]]s of Bermuda are five species of [[bat]]s, all of which also occur in the eastern United States<U+2014>''[[Lasionycteris noctivagans]]'', ''[[Lasiurus borealis]]'', ''[[Lasiurus cinereus]]'', ''[[Lasiurus seminolus]]'', and ''[[Perimyotis subflavus]]''.<ref>Grady, F.V. and Olson, S.L. 2006.
