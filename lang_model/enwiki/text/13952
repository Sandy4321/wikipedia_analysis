'''Henry of France''' ([[1121]] &ndash; [[13 November]] [[1175]]), [[Bishop of Beauvais]] (1149&ndash;1162), then [[Archbishop of Reims]] (1162&ndash;1175), was a son of [[Louis the Fat]], [[King of France]] and his second wife [[Ad<U+00E9>laide de Maurienne]].

Destined for a place in the church from an early age, Henry was [[tonsure]]d at the age of thirteen and [[ordained]] two years later. He was advanced by stages through the church hierarchy with a view to preparing him for a position of the highest rank, befitting the son of a king. In 1146, however, he entered [[Clairvaux Abbey]] and became an ordinary monk.

In 1149, with the death of Bishop Odo III of Beauvais, the [[cathedral chapter]], persuaded by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], elected Henry to the bishopric. Henry was ill-prepared for the political reponsibilities of his new office, and came into conflict with the burghers of [[Beauvais]]. King Louis backed the town, while Henry was supported by brother [[Robert I of Dreux|Robert]], [[Count of Dreux]]. The conflict was finally settled by [[Pope Eugenius III]] in 1151.

In 1162 Henry became Archbishop of Reims, succeeded at Beauvais by [[Bartholomew of Montcornet]]. Henry organised a church counsil at Reims in 1164. He again found himself in conflict with the town, but was supported by his brother [[Louis VII of France|Louis]], now King as Louis VII. The revolt was suppressed and Archbishop Henry devoted himself to beautifying [[Reims]].
