'''Hurricane Alice''' was a [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1]] [[hurricane]] that struck extreme northern [[Mexico]] and southern [[Texas]] in June 1954, causing at least 55&nbsp;deaths. It formed in the Bay of Campeche on June&nbsp;24, and maintained its intensity as it progressed inland between Texas and Mexico. Alice is most remembered as causing the worst [[flooding]] ever seen along the [[Rio Grande]],<ref name="TexasClimate">

</ref> estimated at a one in 2000&nbsp;year event. The [[Pecos River]] crested at {{convert|96.24|ft|m|abbr=on}}, which joined with the Rio Grande to produce significant flooding. The floodwaters destroyed bridges and [[Dike (construction)|dike]]s and flooded many cities along the inner reaches of the river. Damage was heaviest in [[Ozona, Texas]], where the floods killed 15&nbsp;people and caused $2&nbsp;million in damage (1954&nbsp;USD). Rainfall peaked at over {{convert|24.07|in|mm|abbr=on}}, most of which fell in a 24&nbsp;hour period. The hurricane was one of two storms named Alice that year.

==Meteorological history==
Alice is estimated to have formed as a tropical storm on June&nbsp;24 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] about halfway between the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] and [[Tamaulipas]]. It quickly strengthened as it moved northwestward, and by the morning of June&nbsp;25, it had reached hurricane strength as it approached the coastline at the [[United States<U+2013>Mexico border]]. Shortly thereafter, it made [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] just south of the border in the [[Mexican state]] of Tamaulipas with winds of 70&ndash;80&nbsp;mph (120&ndash;130&nbsp;km/h). The storm approximately followed the [[Rio Grande]] after moving inland, passing over [[Laredo, Texas]] late on June&nbsp;25 as it weakened. The storm dissipated early on June&nbsp;26 over southern Texas.<ref name="MWR">

The peak rainfall occurred in a small area centered near the [[Pecos River]].

In addition, some locals in western Texas experienced rainfall from Alice that exceed yearly averages. This contributed to significant flooding along the Pecos River, reaching a flood stage of {{convert|55|ft|m|abbr=on}} in Pandale.

==Aftermath==
The disastrous flooding caused by Hurricane Alice along the [[Rio Grande]] accelerated the joint US-Mexico [[Amistad dam project]], a series of [[flood control]] [[dam]]s designed to prevent similar catastrophes in the future. The project, in the planning stages for decades before the storm, was finally begun in 1960.<ref name="DelRio">

Leftover waters from the storm led to an increase in mosquitoes in Texas, which prompted a widespread application of larvicide via airplane. On July&nbsp;1, the flood areas of southern Texas were declared a major disaster area. This followed a delivery of 2&nbsp;flood specialists, 20&nbsp;laborers, 2&nbsp;portable water treatment plants, 7&nbsp;trucks, and a quantity of insecticides and water treatment tablets.<ref name="pub"/> Residents in Laredo, Texas provided citizens of its neighboring city Nuevo Laredo, Mexico with food and water. The Mexican government provided temporary homes for the affected citizens of the flood. American officials distributed typhoid vaccinations, water purification tablets, and insecticides to the American cities along the Rio Grande. Safe water was eventually restored to Laredo, Texas on July&nbsp;12. All emergency work related to the disaster was finished by September&nbsp;3.<ref name="pub"/>

Members of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Army flew 21&nbsp;helicopters with over 81&nbsp;tons of relief supplies to the affected people of Mexico and Texas, including food, water, medicine, and clothing.<ref name="mil"/>
