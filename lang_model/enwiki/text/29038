'''Fergus M<U+00F3>r mac Eirc''' ([[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Fergus M<U+00F2>r Mac Earca'') was a legendary king of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]]. He was the son of [[Erc of Dalriada|Erc]]. 

While his historicity may be debatable, his posthumous importance as the founder of [[Scotland]] in the [[national myth]] of Medieval and Renaissance Scotland is not in doubt. Rulers of Scotland from [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin<U+00E1>ed mac Ailp<U+00ED>n]] until the present time claim descent from Fergus M<U+00F3>r.

==Fergus M<U+00F3>r in early sources==
The historical record, such as it is, consists of an entry in the [[Annals of Tigernach]], for the year 501, which states: ''Feargus Mor mac Earca cum gente Dal Riada partem Britaniae tenuit, et ibi mortuus est.'' (Fergus M<U+00F3>r mac Eirc, with the people of D<U+00E1>l Riata, held part of Britain, and he died there.) However, the forms of Fergus, Erc and D<U+00E1>l Riata are later ones, written down long after the 6th century. The record in the Annals has given rise to theories of invasions of Argyll from Ireland, but these are not considered authentic.<ref>"[S]tories of Dalriadic origins cannot be held to be worthy of acceptance as history", Sally Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', p. 9, quoting [[David Dumville]]. See also Ewan Campbell, "Were the Scots Irish ?".</ref>

Fergus is also found in the king lists of D<U+00E1>l Riata, and later of Scotland, of which the [[Senchus Fer n-Alban]] and the [[Duan Albanach]] can be taken as examples. The Senchus states that Fergus M<U+00F3>r was also known as Mac Nisse M<U+00F3>r. These sources probably date from the 10th and 11th centuries respectively, between 30 and 40 generations after Fergus may have lived. 

The Senchus and the Duan name Fergus's father as Erc son of Eochaid Muinremuir. A Middle Irish genealogy of the kings of [[kingdom of Alba|Alba]] gives an extensive genealogy for Fergus: [Fergus] m. h-Eircc m. Echdach Muinremuir m. <U+00D3>engusa Fir m. Feideilmid m. <U+00D3>engusa m. Feideilmid m. Cormaicc, and a further forty-six generations here omitted.<ref>The early part of Fergus's ancestry is shared with that given for Sen<U+00E1>n son of Gerrgenn in the ''Betha Shen<U+00E1>in meic Geirginn'' from the [[Book of Lismore]]; compare Rawlinson B. 502 <U+00B6>1696 Genelach R<U+00ED>g n-Alban and the ''Betha Shen<U+00E1>in'', at line 1792 and after.</ref>

These sources, while they offer evidence for the importance of Fergus M<U+00F3>r in Medieval times, are not evidence for his historical career. Indeed, only one king in the 6th century in Scotland is known from contemporary evidence, [[Ceretic of Alt Clut]], and even this identification rests upon a later gloss to [[Saint Patrick]]'s ''Letter to Coroticus''. The first kings of D<U+00E1>l Riata whose existences are reasonably sure are Fergus's grandsons [[Gabr<U+00E1>n mac Domangairt]] and [[Comgall mac Domangairt|Comgall]], or perhaps his great-grandson [[<U+00C1>ed<U+00E1>n mac Gabr<U+00E1>in]].

==Fergus M<U+00F3>r in later accounts==
[[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s early 15th century ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' says that Fergus was the first Scot to rule in Scotland, and that Cin<U+00E1>ed mac Ailp<U+00ED>n was his descendant. In addition, he writes that Fergus brought the [[Stone of Scone]] with him from Ireland, that he was succeeded by a son named D<U+00FA>ngal. A list of kings follows which is corrupt but bears some relation to those found in earlier sources.<ref>See chapters xliv and liv.</ref>

If Wyntoun's account adds little to earlier ones, at the end of the 16th century [[George Buchanan (humanist)|George Buchanan]] in his ''[[Rerum Scoticarum Historia]]'' added much, generally following [[John of Fordun]]. In this version, the Scots had been expelled from Scotland when the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] under one Maximus conquered all of Britain. His father Eugenius had been killed by the Romans, and Fergus, '''Fergusius II''' according to Buchanan's count, was raised in exile in [[Scandinavia]].  He later fought with the [[Franks]], before eventually returning to Scotland and reconquering the Scottish lands. He was killed in battle against Durstus, king of the [[Picts]], and was succeeded by his son Eugenius.<ref>Aikman's edition, pp. 202&ndash;218.</ref>

Buchanan's king, [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]], shared the scholar's view of the origins of his line, describing himself in one of many verses written to his wife [[Anne of Denmark]], as the "happie Monarch sprung of Ferguse race". Nor was James VI the last ruler to share this belief. The Great Gallery of the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] in [[Edinburgh]] was decorated with eighty-nine of [[Jacob de Wet]]'s portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus to [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]], produced to the order of James's grandson.
