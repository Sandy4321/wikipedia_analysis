'''''Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs''''', usually referred to as '''''Animaniacs''''', is an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]], distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and produced by [[Amblin Entertainment]]. The cartoon was the second animated series produced by the collaboration of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Warner Bros. Animation]] during the [[Modern animation of the United States|animation renaissance]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The studio's first series, ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', was a success among younger viewers, and a series that attracted a sizable number of adult viewers. The ''Animaniacs'' writers and animators, led by senior producer [[Tom Ruegger]], used the experience gained from the previous series to create new animated characters that were cast in the mold of [[Chuck Jones]] and [[Tex Avery]]'s creations.<ref name="Spielberg1">{{cite web| last =Carugati| first =Anna| title =Interviews: Steven Spielberg| work =World Screen | publisher =WSN Inc.|date=October 2006| url =http://www.worldscreen.com/interviewscurrent.php?filename=Spielberg1006.htm| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2007-05-08}}</ref>

The comedy of ''Animaniacs'' was a broad mix of old-fashioned wit, [[slapstick]], [[pop culture]] references, and cartoon violence and wackiness. The show featured a number of educational segments that covered subjects such as history, math, geography, science, and social studies.  ''Animaniacs'' itself was a [[variety show]], with short [[skit]]s featuring a large cast of characters. While the show had no set format, episode structure varied to suit the needs of the segments included; the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini-episodes, each starring a different set of characters, and bridging segments.

''Animaniacs'' first aired on "[[FOX Kids]]" from 1993 until 1995 and later appeared on [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] from 1995 to 1998 as part of its "[[Kids' WB]]" afternoon programming block. The series had a total of 99 episodes and one film, titled ''[[Wakko's Wish]]''. Like other animated series, it continued to appear on television through [[Television syndication|syndication]] long after its original airdate. As of [[June 19]], [[2007]], the first 75 episodes have been released in three [[DVD]] boxsets. The release of volume four is still undetermined.

==Background==
===Premise===
The [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|Warner siblings]] and the other ''Animaniacs'' characters lived in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]].<ref name="creation"/>  However, characters from the series had episodes in various places and periods of time. The ''Animaniacs'' characters interacted with famous persons and creators of the past and present as well as mythological characters and characters from modern television. Andrea Romano, the voice director and caster for Animaniacs, said that the Warner siblings functioned to "tie the show together," by appearing in and introducing other characters' segments.<ref name= "dvdint1"/>  ''Animaniacs'' segments ranged in time, from bridging segments less than a minute long to episodes spanning the entire show length, and each episode usually consisted of two or three cartoon shorts.<ref name = "airdate1"/>  Writer Peter Hastings said that the varying episode lengths gave the show a "sketch comedy atmosphere."<ref name= "dvdint2"/>

===Characters===
{{seealso|List of Animaniacs characters}}
''Animaniacs'' had a large cast of characters. The large cast was separated into separate segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warners, [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot]], were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s, when they escaped.<ref name="creation">{{cite episode | title = Newsreel of the Stars | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-09-13 | season = 1 | number = 1}}</ref> [[Pinky and the Brain]] were two genetically altered laboratory mice that continuously plotted and attempted to take over the world.<ref name="pinkyandthebrain">{{cite episode | title = Win Big | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-09-14 | season = 1 | number = 2}}</ref> [[Slappy Squirrel]] was an aged cartoon star that would easily outwit antagonists and educate her nephew, [[Skippy Squirrel]], about cartoon techniques.<ref name="Slappy">{{cite episode | title = Slappy Goes Walnuts | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-09-15 | season = 1 | number = 3}}</ref> Additional principal characters included [[Rita and Runt]], [[Buttons and Mindy]], [[Chicken Boo]], [[Flavio and Marita]] (The Hip Hippos), [[Katie Ka-Boom]], a trio of pigeons known as The [[Goodfeathers]] and [[Minerva Mink]].

===Creation and inspiration===
The general premise of ''Animaniacs'' and the Warner siblings were created by Tom Ruegger, who also came up with the concept and characters for [[Pinky and the Brain]]. Ruegger was also the senior producer and creative leader of the show. Writer Deanna Oliver contributed ''The Goodfeathers'' scripts and the character ''Chicken Boo''.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Producer and writer Sherri Stoner contributed heavily to ''Slappy Squirrel'' and ''Pinky and the Brain''.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Nicholas Hollander's ''Katie Kaboom'' was based on his teenage daughter.<ref name = "dvdint2"/> The ''Animaniacs'' cast of characters had a variety of inspiration, from celebrities to writer's family members to other writers. Executive Producer Steven Spielberg said that the ''Animaniacs'' cast was inspired by the irreverence in [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons.<ref name="Spielberg1"/>

Senior Producer Tom Ruegger modeled the Warners<U+2019> personalities heavily after those of his three sons.<ref name= "origin1">{{Citation|author =| title=TV Production: What a Character! Part II of a series: The Evolution of Animaniacs |magazine=Animation Magazine |pages=12|year=1995 |date=July 1995}}</ref>  Because the Warners were portrayed as cartoon stars from the early [[The Golden Age of American animation|1930s]], Ruegger and other artists for ''Animaniacs'' made the images of the Warners similar to cartoon characters of the early 1930s.<ref name= "origin1"/> Simple black and white drawings were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s, including [[Bosko]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], [[Bimbo (Fleischer)|Bimbo]], and the early version of [[Mickey Mouse]].

Tom Ruegger created [[Pinky and the Brain]] after being inspired by the personalities of two of his ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' colleagues, Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton. Ruegger thought of the premise of ''Pinky and the Brain'' when he wondered what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world.<ref name= "pinkyorigin">{{Citation|last =Will| first= Ed |title= BRAIN POWER: Pinky, genius pal to resume plotting in 1997|newspaper= The Denver Post |year=1996 |date=June 11, 1996}}</ref>

Slappy Squirrel was created by Sherri Stoner, when another writer and friend of Stoner, John McCann, made fun of Stoner<U+2019>s career in TV movies playing troubled teens. When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teens when she was fifty years old, Sherri developed the idea of Slappy's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager.<ref name= "dvdint2"/> Sherri Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and "have the dirt on [them]."<ref name= "dvdint1"/>

==Production==
===Producers===
[[Steven Spielberg]] was the executive producer during the entire run, Tom Ruegger was the senior producer, Jean MacCurdy was the executive in charge of production, and Rich Arons, Sherri Stoner, Peter Hastings, Rusty Mills, and Liz Holzman were producers of the show. The producers of the show usually had other jobs on the series; Tom Ruegger, Rich Arons, and Sherri Stoner all served as writers, and Spielberg was very involved in the show<U+2019>s writing, checking every script for the series.<ref name = "airdate1"/> Voice director Andrea Romano said that Spielberg also came up with story ideas, read storyboards, and came to recording sessions.<ref name= "dvdint1">{{cite video| people = Maurice LaMarche, ''et al.'' | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 1. Special Features: Animaniacs Live! | medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Home Video | date = 2006 }}</ref>

===Writers===
Writers for ''Animaniacs'' included writers [[Tom Ruegger]], [[Sherri Stoner]] and [[Paul Rugg]],  [[Deanna Oliver]], [[John McCann]], Nicholas Hollander, Peter Hastings, Charlie Howell, Gordon Bressack, Earl Kress, [[Tom Minton]], and Randy Rogel. Writers Hastings, Rugg, Stoner, McCann, Howell, and Bressack were involved in sketch comedy.<ref name= "dvdint2"/>  Other writers for the series came from cartoon backgrounds, including Kress, Minton, and Randy Rogel.<ref name= "dvdint2"/>

The writing for ''Animaniacs'' was not only comprised of made-up stories, as writer Peter Hastings said: 
"We weren<U+2019>t really there to tell compelling stories(...)  [As a writer] you could do a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial(...) you could do all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up."<ref name= "dvdint2"/>  Writers for the series wrote into ''Animaniacs'' stories that happened to them; the episodes "Ups and Downs," "Survey Ladies," and "I Got Yer Can" were episodes based on true stories that happened to Paul Rugg,<ref name= "dvdint3a"/> Deanna Oliver, and Sherri Stoner,<ref name= "dvdint2"/> respectively. Another episode, "Bumbi<U+2019>s Mom," was both an episode that parodied the film ''Bambi'' and a story based on Stoner<U+2019>s childhood reaction to the film.<ref name= "dvdint1"/> 

In an interview, writers for the series said that the writing for ''Animaniacs'' was non-restrictive and open.<ref name= "dvdint2"/>  Writer Peter Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because ''Animaniacs'' segments could widely vary in both time and subject.<ref name= "dvdint2"/>  Writer Sherri Stoner said that the ''Animaniacs'' writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story, as was the case in the episode "The Three Muska-Warners".<ref name= "dvdint2"/>  Writers Rugg, Hastings and Stoner said that the ''Animaniacs'' writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about and parody subjects that would not be touched on other series.<ref name= "dvdint2"/>

===Voicing===
The ''Animaniacs'' voice cast came from ''Animaniacs'' predecessor, ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', including the voices of Yakko and Dot, [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Tress MacNeille]], respectively. Andrea Romano, the voice director and caster for ''Animaniacs'', said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko: "We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko." Palsen also played the roles of Pinky and Dr. Scratchansniff.<ref name = "airdate1"/>  Romano said that the casters had "no trouble" choosing the role of Dot: "Tress MacNeille was just hilarious (...) And yet [she had] that edge."<ref name= "dvdint1"/> The voice of Wakko, [[Jess Harnell]], on the other hand, was not from ''Tiny Toons'', and said that before Animaniacs, he had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for [[Disney]] which he "fell into."<ref name= "dvdint1"/> Harnell said that at the audition for the show, he did a [[John Lennon]] [[impressionist (entertainment)|impression]] and the audition "went great."<ref name= "dvdint1"/>  Slappy the Squirrel was played by producer and writer [[Sherri Stoner]], who said that, when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg, Spielberg said she should fill the role.<ref name= "dvdint1"/>  The voice actress who played the voice of Rita, [[Bernadette Peters]], is a professional singer and was wanted for the role by Romano herself.<ref name= "dvdint1"/> Other voice actors included [[Maurice LaMarche]], the voice of the Brain and the belching segments "The Great Wakkorotti" (although Jess Harnell is commonly mistaken for the role);<ref name= "dvdint1"/> [[Frank Welker]], the voice of Runt; and Jeff Bennet. Tom Ruegger's three sons also played roles on the series. Nathan Ruegger voiced Skippy Squirrel, nephew to Slappy, throughout the duration of the series; Luke Ruegger voiced ''The Flame'' in historical segments on ''Animaniacs''; and Cody Ruegger voiced Birdie from ''Wild Blue Yonder''.

===Animation===
In order to speed up the production of episodes, different studios, both American and international, simultaneously animated Animaniacs over the course of the show<U+2019>s production. The animation companies included [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha]], [[StarToons]], [[Wang Film Productions]], [[Freelance Animators New Zealand]], and [[AKOM]], and most Animaniacs episodes frequently had animation from different companies in each episode's respective segments.<ref>Credits from various ''Animaniacs'' episodes.</ref>  While these companies animated and colored Animaniacs, the background layouts were done by a domestic studio.  

Animaniacs was made with a higher production value than standard television animation. Rich Aarons, an ''Animaniacs'' director and producer, said that ''Animaniacs'' had a higher [[cel]] count than most television animation. Aarons said that ''Animaniacs'' was unique in that characters moved more fluently, and did not simply pose, stand still, and speak, as in other television cartoons.<ref name= "dvdint3a">{{cite video| people = Tom Ruegger, ''et al.'' | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 3.

===Music===
{{seealso|Animaniacs Title Sequence|Yakko's World|Wakko's America}}
''Animaniacs'' was a very musical cartoon, with every episode featuring at least one original score. The idea for an original musical score in every episode came from Steven Spielberg.<ref name= "music">{{Citation| last=Schmuckler | first=Eric| year=1995 | date =April 17,1995 | title= The new face in toontown. (Kids WB chief Jamie Kellner) (Special Report: Kids TV). | periodical=MEDIAWEEK | volume=5 | issue=16 | pages=22}}</ref>  For its music, Animaniacs used a 40-piece orchestra, with music composed by [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]] and assistant composers Steve and Julie Bernstein.<ref name= "dvdint1"/>  The use of the large orchestra in modern Warner Bros. animation began with ''Animaniacs'' predecessor, ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', but Spielberg pushed for its use even more in ''Animaniacs''.<ref name= "dvdint1">{{cite video| people = Maurice LaMarche, ''et al.'' | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 1. Special Features: Animaniacs Live! | medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Home Video | date = 2006 }}</ref>  Although the outcome was a very expensive show to produce, every episode was given an original score, as "the sound sets us apart from everyone else in animation," said Jean MacCurdy, the executive in charge of production for the series.<ref name= "music"/>  Assistant composers Steve and Julie Bernstein said that not only was the ''Animaniacs'' music written in the same style as that of ''Looney Tunes'' composer Carl Stalling, but that the music used the same studio and piano that Carl Stalling used.<ref name= "dvdint1"/>  Senior producer Tom Ruegger said that writers Randy Rogel, Nicholas Hollander, and Deanna Oliver wrote "a lot of music" for the series.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  

''Animaniacs'' had a variety of music types. Many ''Animaniacs'' songs were parodies of classical or folk music with an educational twist, such as "[[Wakko's America]]", which listed all the states in the [[United States|U.S.]] and their capitals to the tune of [[Turkey in the Straw]].<ref name="America">{{cite episode | title = Wakko<U+2019>s America | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-10-11 | season = 1 | number = 25}}</ref> Another song, titled "[[The Presidents (song)|The Presidents]]", named every US president to the tune of the [[William Tell Overture]].<ref name="presidents">{{cite episode | title = The Presidents | series = Animaniacs | network = Kids' WB | airdate = 1995-11-11 | season = 3 | number = 75}}</ref> Non-educational songs included songs that were simply parodies of other songs, like the segment "Slippin' on the Ice", a parody of "[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]";<ref name="slipping">{{cite episode | title = Slippin' on the Ice Song | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-11-29 | season = 1 | number = 50}}</ref> songs mocking things in everyday life, such as the song "Be Careful What You Eat" that made fun of all the ingredients in junk food;<ref name="whatyoueat">{{cite episode | title = Be Careful What You Eat (Song) | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-10-15 | season = 1 | number = 23}}</ref> and songs making fun of celebrities and other media, such as the song "Video [[Revue]]", which listed movie stars and films.<ref name="review">{{cite episode | title = Video Revue | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-11-23 | season = 1 | number = 47}}</ref>  Most of the show's songs were sung by the Warners. Pinky and the Brain occasionally had songs, and the most complicated songs in the series usually went to Rita, voiced by singer [[Bernadette Peters]]. Most of the groups of characters even had their own theme songs for their segment on the show.  

The song "[[Yakko's World]]," with lyrics by Randy Rogel, is perhaps the series' most famous. Other songs include "Yakko's Universe", "[[United Nations|U.N.]] Me", and "[[Schnitzelbank]]", among others. The [[Animaniacs Title Sequence|''Animaniacs'' series theme song]], which was sung by the Warners, was a very important part of the show. The [[theme song]] had a variety of alternate endings and in the series' first season won an [[Emmy Award]] for best song.<ref name="emmyaward1">{{cite web|url=http://wba.toonzone.net/archives/94.html|title=Warner Bros. Animation Chronology: 1994| last =O'Dell| first = Ron| work =The Warner Bros. Animation Archive|publisher=Toon Zone|accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref>  The music for the title sequence was composed by [[Richard Stone (composer)|Richard Stone]], and the lyrics were written by [[Tom Ruegger]]. Several ''Animaniacs'' albums and Sing-along VHS tapes were released, including the CDs ''Animaniacs'', ''Yakko<U+2019>s World'', and ''Variety Pack'', and the tape ''Animaniacs Sing-Along: Yakko's World''.

==Hallmarks and humor==
The humor of ''Animaniacs'' varied in type, ranging from parody to cartoon violence.  ''Animaniacs'' made parodies of television shows and films, one of which being a parody of a large ''Animaniacs'' competitor, [[Power Rangers]].<ref name="Spielberg2">{{Citation| last = Closs| first = Larry| title = Spielberg Toons In: Moviemaker extraordinaire Steven Spielberg reveals he<U+2019>s also an animaniac at heart| periodical = TV Guide| pages = 33<U+2013>36| date = October 28, 1995| url = http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/berg951.html}}</ref>  In an interview, Spielberg defended the "irreverence" of ''Animaniacs'', saying that the ''Animaniacs'' crew has "a point of view" and does not "sit back passively and play both sides equally."<ref name="Spielberg2"/>  Spielberg also said that ''Animaniacs''' humor of social commentary and irreverence were inspired by the Marx Brothers<ref name="Spielberg2"/> and [[Looney Tunes]] cartoons.<ref name="Spielberg1"/>  ''Animaniacs'', among other Spielberg-produced shows, had a large amount of cartoon violence. Spielberg defended the violence in ''Animaniacs'' by saying that the series had a balance of both violent humor and educational segments, so the series would never became either too violent or "benign."<ref name="Spielberg2"/> ''Animaniacs'' also made use of catchphrases, recurring jokes and segments, and "adult" humor.

===Recurring jokes and catchphrases===
Characters on ''Animaniacs'' had catchphrases, with some characters having more than one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko<U+2019>s "Goodnight, everybody!," Wakko's "Faboo!" and Dot<U+2019>s "I<U+2019>m cute!"  The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all of the Warners was "Hello-o-o, nurse!"<ref name="creation"/>  Tom Ruegger said that the "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" line was intended to be a catchphrase much like [[Bugs Bunny]]'s line, "What's up, doc?"<ref name="dvdint3a"/>   Characters Pinky and the Brain had a catchphrase where Brain would ask Pinky, "Are you pondering what I<U+2019>m pondering?" to which Pinky would always respond with a non-sequitur. At the start of all Pinky and the Brain episodes, Pinky asks "Gee Brain, what do you want to do tonight?", to which Brain answers "The same thing we do every night, Pinky... try to take over the world!"  in a segment that preceded the theme song. Also, Brain would shout "Yes!" in response to an idea that he liked.<ref name="pinkyandthebrain"/>  Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode "Win Big," and then Producer Sherri Stoner utilized them and had them put into later episodes.<ref name="dvdint2"/>  Skippy Squirrel had the catchphrase, "Spew!" which was used whenever something disgusting was brought up. Slappy had the catchphrase, "Now that's comedy!" which would be said at the end of every Slappy Squirrel cartoon.<ref name="Slappy"/>  Catchphrases were also found in the segments ''Goodfeathers'' and ''Buttons and Mindy''.

[[Running gags]] and recurring segments were very common in the show. One example is the close-up of the water tower after the closing credits; right before the end of the episode, the water tower door would open, one or more of the characters would come out, say something to the audience (usually a catchphrase or a reference to one of the episodes), and the water tower door would close.<ref name="credits">{{cite episode | title = Closing Credits | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-09-13 | season = 1 | number = 1}}</ref>  Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag, such as the segment ''The Wheel of Morality'', were good for easier production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once.<ref name= "dvdint3a"/>  ''The Wheel of Morality'' was also used to take up time in an episode that was running short.<ref name= "dvdint3a"/>  Another running gag was that characters would appear in one another<U+2019>s segments. While one set of characters would be moving along in their episode<U+2019>s plot, another set of characters would make a brief appearance, and sometimes point out that they are not in the correct episode. ''Animaniacs'' even devoted an entire episode to characters and segments being switched around.<ref name="switch">{{cite episode | title = Very Special Opening; In the Garden of Mindy; No Place Like Homeless; Katie Ka-Boo; Baghdad Cafe | series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-11-05 | season = 1 | number = 35}}</ref>  ''Animaniacs'' took this recurring joke even further, and ''Animaniacs'' characters appeared in other Spielberg shows, such as ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', ''[[Freakazoid]]'', and ''[[Histeria]]''. Characters from ''Freakazoid'' and ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' also made appearances in ''Animaniacs''. Because of Steven Spielberg's involvement in the series, a running gag was that his films were mentioned in the series and a caricature of Spielberg appeared numerous times; in the episode "Hooked on a Ceiling", Spielberg was made the "[[His Eminence|eminence]]" of the [[Sistine Chapel]], and the Warners also painted an ''[[E.T.]]'' picture on its ceiling.<ref name="ceiling">{{cite episode | title = Hooked on a Ceiling| series = Animaniacs | network = FOX Kids | airdate = 1993-09-16 | season = 1 | number = 4}}</ref>

==="Adult" humor and content===
A great deal of Animaniacs' humor and content was aimed at an adult audience. The [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] ''[[Pirates of Penzance]]'' and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' were [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan|parodied in episode 3, "HMS Yakko"]]. Furthermore, jokes and statements that are double entendres (such as Yakko<U+2019>s song of eight of the nine planets in the Solar System, after which Wakko reminds Yakko that he forgot [[Uranus]]) were used throughout the duration of the show. These jokes are signified by Yakko blowing a kiss and shouting, "Good night, everybody!", thereby ending the sketch. Some content of ''Animaniacs'' was not only aimed at an adult audience but were suggestive in nature. For example, one character, [[Minerva Mink]] had episodes that network censors considered too sexually suggestive for the show's intended audience, for which she was soon de-emphasized as a featured character.<ref name= "dvdint2">{{cite video| people = Maurice LaMarche, Tom Ruegger, ''et al.'' | title =Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs: Volume 2. Special Features:The Writers Flipped They Have No Script. | medium = DVD| publisher = Warner Home Video | year = 2006 }}</ref>  

The ''Animaniacs'' characters had personalities and character traits similar to those of film stars in movies marketed to adults. The Warners personalities were made similar to those of the Marx Brothers and Jerry Lewis, in that they, according to writer Peter Hastings, "wreak havoc," in "serious situations."<ref name="dvdint2"/>  In addition, the show's recurring [[Goodfeathers]] segment was populated with characters based on characters from the 1990 film ''[[Goodfellas]]'', an R-rated crime drama neither marketed nor intended for children.<ref name="dvdint1"/>

[[Image:AnimaniacsLewis.jpg|right|thumb|Parodies and caricatures made up a large part of ''Animaniacs''. The episode "Hello Nice Warners" introduced a [[Jerry Lewis]] caricature (left), who made frequent appearances on the series.]]

===Parodies===
{{main|Parodies in Animaniacs}}
''Animaniacs'' parodied popular TV shows and movies and caricatured celebrities.<ref name= "dvdint3a"/>  One episode, "The Please Please Please Get a Life Foundation", even made fun of ''Animaniacs'' own Internet fans.<ref name="getalife">{{cite episode | title = The Please Please Please Get a Life Foundation | series = Animaniacs | network =  Kids<U+2019> WB | airdate = 1995-09-23 | season = 3 | number = 73}}</ref> ''Animaniacs'' spoofs were multi-layered, with the episode parodying one specific subject and referencing other subjects along the way. For instance, the episode "Hooked on a Ceiling" did not only parody ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'', but it also featured [[Quasimodo]] shouting "Sanctuary! Sanctuary!", a direct reference to ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.<ref name="ceiling"/>  ''Animaniacs'' also made fun of celebrities, major motion pictures, television shows for adults, television shows for children, and trends in the US.  ''Animaniacs'' also made potshots of Disney films, creating parodies of such films as ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', ''[[Bambi]]'', and others.  ''Animaniacs'' Director Russell Calaberese said that not only did it become a compliment to be parodied on ''Animaniacs'' but that being parodied on the series would be taken as a "badge of honor."<ref name= "dvdint3a"/>

==Response==
''Animaniacs'' became a very successful show, gathering fans in both demographics of children and adults. The series received ratings higher than its competitors and won eight Daytime Emmy Awards and one Peabody Award during its run.  

===Ratings and popularity===
During its run, ''Animaniacs'' became the second-most popular children<U+2019>s show in both demographics of children ages 2<U+2013>11 and children ages 6<U+2013>11.<ref name= "mostkids">{{Citation|last =Kent| first= Milton |title= Warner Bros. is whistling a happy toon: New characters have attitude and an audience |newspaper= The Baltimore Sun |year=1994 |date=January 30, 1994}}</ref><ref name = "ratings3"/> ''Animaniacs'', along with other animated series, helped to bring "FOX Kids" ratings much larger than those of the channel<U+2019>s competitors. For instance, in November of 1993, ''Animaniacs'' and ''Tiny Toon Adventures'' almost doubled the ratings of their rival shows, ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' and ''[[Goof Troop]]'', in both the 2<U+2013>11 and 6<U+2013>11 demographics that are very important to children's networks.<ref name= "mostkids"/> On "Kids' WB", ''Animaniacs'' gathered about one-million children viewers every week.<ref name= "ratings2"/>

Although ''Animaniacs'' was popular among younger viewers (the target demographic for Warner Bros.' TV cartoons), adults also responded positively to the show; in 1995, more than 21 percent of the weekday audience (4 p.m., Monday through Friday) and more than 23 percent of the Saturday morning (8 a.m.) viewers were 25 years or older.<ref name= "mostadults">{{Citation|last =Gates| first= Annita |title= 'ANIMANIACS' IS ONE 'TOON THAT'S LOONEY AS ITS PREDECESSORS |newspaper= The Chicago Tribune|year=1995 |date=February 14, 1995}}</ref> The large adult fanbase even led to one of the first [[Internet]]-based [[fandom]] cultures.<ref name = "internetfan1">Sandler, p. 200</ref> During the show's prime, the Internet newsgroup alt.tv.animaniacs was an active gathering place for fans of the show (most of whom were adults) to post reference guides, [[fan fiction]], and fan-made artwork about ''Animaniacs''.<ref name = "internetfan2">Sandler, p. 194</ref>  The online popularity of the show did not go unnoticed by the show's producers, and twenty of the most active participants on the newsgroup were invited to the [[Warner Bros.

Furthermore, the series even gained high ratings under disadvantageous circumstances. During November 1993, the Fox-affiliate channel 33 had a three-day transmitter failure; in this time period, 11,000 homes tuned in to the blank screen during the ''Animaniacs'' timeslot, which was almost double the rating of the rival KXTX-TV children's show.<ref name="ratings1">{{cite web| url = http://www.keyframeonline.com/Animation/Animaniacs/422/| title = Animaniacs| author= Lupercal| publisher = Keyframe| accessdate = 2007-04-15}}</ref>

==History==

{{seealso|List of Animaniacs episodes}}
===Preproduction===
Before ''Animaniacs'' was put into production, various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up in order to create both the characters and premise of the series. For instance, ideas that were thrown out were [[Rita and Runt]] being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that Senior Producer Tom Ruegger had since his college years.<ref name= "dvdint3a"/>  After the characters from the series were created, they were all shown to Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, who would decide which characters would make it into ''Animaniacs'' (the characters [[Buttons and Mindy]] were chosen by Spielberg's daughter).<ref name= "dvdint3a"/>  The characters' designs came from various sources, including caricatures of other writers,<ref name="pinkyorigin"/> designs based on early cartoon characters, and characters that simply had a more modern design.<ref name= "dvdint3a"/>

The series was popular enough for Warner Bros. Animation to invest in additional episodes of ''Animaniacs'' past the traditional 65-episode marker for syndication.

===Aftermath and syndication===
After ''Animaniacs'', Spielberg collaborated with Warner Bros. Animation for a third time to produce the short-lived series ''[[Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid!|Freakazoid]]'', along with the ''Animaniacs'' spin-off series ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''. Warner Bros. also produced two additional "zany" series in the later half of the decade entitled ''[[Histeria!]]'', a series focusing on American and World history, and ''[[Detention (TV series)|Detention]]'', an animated sitcom of quirky junior high kids trying to get out of [[Detention (Academia)|after-school detention]]; both series were eventually canceled. Later, Warner Bros. cut back the size of its animation studio because the show ''Histeria!'' went over its budget,<ref name="emmyaward4"/> and most production on further Warner Bros. animated comedy series ceased.<ref name= "layoff"/>

''Animaniacs'', along with ''Tiny Toon Adventures'', continued to rerun in syndication through the 1990s into the early-2000s after production of new episodes ceased.

===Print===
An ''Animaniacs'' comic book, published by [[DC Comics]], ran from 1995 to 2000 (59 regular monthly issues, plus two specials). Initially, these featured all the characters except for Pinky and the Brain, who were published in their own comic series, though cameos were possible. Eventually, the Pinky and the Brain comic was discontinued, and was merged back into the ''Animaniacs'' series, which was then titled as ''Animaniacs! featuring Pinky and the Brain''. The ''Animaniacs'' comic series, like the show, parodied TV and comics standards, such as ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', among others.

An ''Animaniacs'' comic strip with art by Walter Carzon ran in the [[United Kingdom]], but was never printed in the [[United States]].

===Video games===
Animaniacs was soon brought into the [[video game]] industry to produce games based on the series. Early notable games include Play Zone!'s [[PC game]] ''Animaniacs Game Pack!'' (1997) and [[Konami]]'s ''[[Animaniacs (video game)|Animaniacs]]'' for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] (1993). More modern games include ''[[Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt]]'' and ''[[Animaniacs: Lights, Camera, Action!]]''. Other Games include ''[[Animaniacs (video game)|Animaniacs]]'' for [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Game Boy]]; ''[[Animaniacs: A Gigantic Adventure]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]]; ''Animaniacs: Splat Ball!'' for [[Personal computer|PC]]; ''Pinky and the Brain: World Conquest'' for [[Personal computer|PC]]; ''Animaniacs: Ten Pin Alley'' for the [[Playstation]] and ''Pinky and the Brain: The Master Plan'' for [[Game Boy Advance]] (Europe only).

===Musical collections===
Because ''Animaniacs'' had many songs, albums featuring songs from the show were produced. These albums include ''Animaniacs'' (1993), ''Yakko's World'' (1994), ''A Christmas Plotz'' (1995), ''The Animaniacs Faboo! Collection'' (1995), ''Animaniacs Variety Pack'' (1995), ''A Hip-Hopera Christmas'' (1997), ''The Animaniacs Go Hollywood'' (2003), and ''The Animaniacs Wacky Universe'' (2003).
