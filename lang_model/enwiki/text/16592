'''Luke Livingston''' (born [[November 4]], [[1982]]) is an [[Australian rules football]]er for the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]], formerly played for the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]'s [[Carlton Football Club]].

He was recruited by Carlton as the number 4 draft pick in the [[2000 AFL Draft]] from [[Kerang, Victoria|Kerang]]. He made his AFL debut for Carlton in Round 4, 2002 against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]].

"Livo" struggled for regular selection during his five seasons at Carlton. Although playing in the forward line as a junior, he was quickly shifted into the backline at Carlton, and it took him a long time to learn the craft. He played mainly for the [[Northern Bullants]] over 2005 and 2006, and was a high quality defender at [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] level, in a backline which was four goals better than any other in 2006. However, he found it difficult to adapt to [[Australian Football League|AFL]] level, and played only five games in 2006. It was at this time where he shared an apartment with Eddie Betts.

Livingston was delisted by the Blues at the end of the 2006. [http://www.afl.com.au/default.asp?pg=news&spg=display&articleid=303868]. He plays for [[Port Melbourne Football Club|Port Melbourne]] in [[2007]], and was selected at full back in the VFL representative side.
