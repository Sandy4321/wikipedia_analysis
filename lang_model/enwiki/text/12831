'''Mark Hutchings''' (born 25 May 1991) is an [[Australian rules football]]er currently listed with the [[West Coast Eagles]] in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). From [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], Hutchings captained his state at the [[2009 AFL Under 18 Championships|2009 National Under-18 Championships]], and, having originally played for {{WAFL EP}} in the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL), was selected by {{AFL StK}} in the [[2009 AFL Draft#2010 Rookie Draft|2010 Rookie Draft]]. A midfielder, he was delisted after a season at the club without having made his debut, and transferred to {{WAFL WP}} upon his return to Western Australia. Establishing himself as a regular player for the team, Hutchings was one of the competition's best players during the [[2012 WAFL season|2012 season]], playing state football, finishing second in the [[Sandover Medal]], and winning West Perth's [[best and fairest]] award. He was drafted by West Coast at the [[2012 AFL Draft#2012 National Draft|2012 National Draft]], and made his senior AFL debut during the [[2013 AFL season|2013 season]].
