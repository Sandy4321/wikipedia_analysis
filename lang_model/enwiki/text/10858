The Texas A&M Aggies compete in the Big 12 Conference and will enter their 117th year of [[college football|football]] competition in the 2011 season. Over the program's history, the Aggies have earned one national title in 1939 and 18 conference titles.<ref>[http://www.aggieathletics.com/index2.php?SID=MFB&pageID=187 A&M's Championships]</ref>  A&M has had two perfect seasons having gone undefeated and unscored upon in both 1917<ref>[http://www.aggieathletics.com/teamstats.php?YOS=1917&SID=MFB Texas A&M Athletics Stats and Boxscores<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and 1919.<ref>[http://www.aggieathletics.com/teamstats.php?YOS=1919&SID=MFB Texas A&M Athletics Stats and Boxscores<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The football program experienced a period of little success lasting from 1944 to 1971, when the Aggies won only two conference titles.  With [[Emory Bellard]] as [[head coach]] beginning in 1972, the Aggies returned to prominence with two 10 win seasons during his short tenure.  He was replaced by [[Tom Wilson (NFL)|Tom Wilson]] who had little success at Texas A&M before [[Jackie Sherrill]] took over the program.  Sherrill won three consecutive conference titles and two [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] postseason games.  His [[defensive coordinator]], [[R. C. Slocum]], replaced him as head coach in 1989.  Slocum finished in the top 25 during 10 of his 14 years at Texas A&M<ref>[http://www.aggieathletics.com/index2.php?SID=MFB&pageID=188 Aggie Football Through the Years]. Texas A&M Athletics.</ref> and won 4 conference titles, including the school's only Big 12 title in 1998.

In late 2002, [[Dennis Franchione]] left his position as head coach at the [[University of Alabama]] to take over Texas A&M's football program from Slocum.  He finished the 2003 season at 4-8.  Franchione finished the 2004 regular season with a 7-4 mark and an invitation to the Cotton Bowl Classic, a game the Aggies lost to [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]].  The 2005 team regressed to 5-6 and defensive coordinator [[Carl Torbush]] was fired, and replaced by [[Gary Darnell]].  Due to the much-needed improvements on defense, the Aggies finished the 2006 regular season with a 9-3 record and a 5-3 mark in Big 12 play, including a 12-7 victory over the Texas Longhorns in Austin, the first over the Longhorns in 6 years.  

In the 2007 season, when the Aggies finished in a three way tie for third place with Texas Tech and Oklahoma State in the Big 12 South, leading only Baylor, which finished last.  Although the team pulled out a 38-30 victory over the Longhorns on the day after Thanksgiving, coach [[Dennis Franchione]] was forced to retire. Former Green Bay Packers coach [[Mike Sherman]] was announced as his replacement three days later. Unfortunately, Sherman's first year at A&M resulted in one of the worst records in years, finishing at 4-8.<ref>http://www.aggieathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/tam-m-footbl-2008-stats.html</ref>   The 2009 season showed some improvement with a 5-2 home record and a 6-7 overall record.<ref>http://www.aggieathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/tam-m-footbl-2009-stats.html</ref> More coaching changes were made after the 2009 season and the hiring of Tim DeRuyter lead the media coverage. In 2008, DeRuyter was the defensive coordinator and safeties coach at Airforce where his defense finished 11th in the NCAA in total defense, and 5th in pass defense.<ref>http://www.aggieathletics.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/deruyter_tim00.html</ref>

The Aggie Football team was featured in the [[ESPN]] television movie, ''[[The Junction Boys]]''. The film dramatized Coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant's]] grueling football practice sessions in 1954 at [[Junction, Texas]].<ref name="junction">{{cite press release|title=The Junction Boys to Premiere Dec. 14|publisher=[[ESPN]]|year=2002|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tvlistings/story?id=1410158|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

[[File:Reed bball.jpg|right|thumb|Player introductions during the 2007 Lone Star Showdown at [[Reed Arena]]]]
Texas A&M [[college basketball|basketball]] had been dormant for much of its recent history until the mid-2000s.  The Aggies have won 11 conference championships, two conference tournament titles, and have 10 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] appearances.  Under former head coach [[Billy Gillispie]], the Aggies finished fourth in conference in 2006 only two years removed from having zero wins in conference play.  Gillispie then led the Aggies to their first NCAA tournament berth since 1987, playing as a 12 seed, and to A&M's first NCAA tournament win since 1980 over fifth seed [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]].  The Aggies were one point short of advancing to the Sweet Sixteen over fourth seed [[Louisiana State University|LSU]], with a final score of 57-58. In the 2007 season, A&M spent most of the season ranked in the top 10 of the polls and became the first Big 12 south team to win against the [[University of Kansas]] in Lawrence since the Big 12 was formed. The Aggies finished with a 27-7 record and finished 2nd in the Big 12. They earned a number 3 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made it to the sweet 16, but fell to the [[University of Memphis]] 64-65. [[Acie Law IV]] was named an All-American. Billy Gillispie left for the [[University of Kentucky]] soon after the season. [[Mark Turgeon]] was named head coach a few days later, and has amassed a 73-31 record in his first three years in College Station, along with three more NCAA tournament appearances and a 3-3 NCAA tournament record.

The women's basketball team had two NCAA tournament appearances, an NWIT title, and a Southwest Conference tournament title before entering the Big 12. The program experienced little success in the new conference until current head coach [[Gary Blair]] took over the program. Blair's teams advanced to the NCAA tournament multiple times. He led the 2011 team to the NCAA national championship.

Ground broke on the [[Cox-McFerrin Center]] in November 2006, a {{convert|68000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} expansion to [[Reed Arena]] which includes new locker rooms, meeting rooms, practice gyms, training rooms, player lounges, and reception areas.

==Director's Cup all-time final standings==
The [[NACDA Director's Cup]] is an [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|award]] given annually by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] to the colleges and universities with the most success in collegiate athletics.  Points for the NACDA Director's Cup are based on order of finish in various [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sponsored championships or in the case of [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|Division I Football]] media base polls. The award originated in 1993, and was presented to NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] schools only.  In 1995, it was extended to [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]], [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]], and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] schools as well, each division receiving its own award.

Texas A&M's yearly final standings among other Division I schools since the cup originated in 1993 are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nacda.cstv.com/directorscup/nacda-directorscup-previous-scoring.html|title=Directors' Cup Previous Scoring|publisher=NACDA Directors Cup|accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/misc/weekend/stories/070409dnspocarlton.371c16a.html|title=Raising NCAA trophies lifts outlook for other Texas A&M teams}}</ref>

==Rivalries==
Texas A&M's biggest rival is the [[Texas Longhorns]].  The university has other significant rivals but few come close to the rivalry shared between Texas A&M and the University of Texas.  The mutual respect and desire to win has given rise to the [[Lone Star Showdown]], an athletic competition that lasts year-round and encompasses all regular-season NCAA athletic events between the two schools.  Though the showdown officially began in 2004, the two teams have been competing with one another for more than a century. With Texas A&M's move to the [[SEC]], the Lone Star Showdown's final game will be played November 24, 2011. Another game between Texas and Texas A&M will not happen until at least 2018, according to Texas athletic director DeLoss Dodds. The 2011 game will mark the end of the 118-year Thanksgiving Day tradition.

Other rivals include the [[Baylor Bears]] (rivalry officially known as [[Battle of the Brazos]]), the [[Texas Tech Red Raiders]] ([[Texas A&M <U+2013> Texas Tech football rivalry]]), and the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] ([[Southwest Classic]]).

Historical rivalries that are no longer active include those from its membership in the [[Southwest Conference]] ([[Rice University|Rice]], the [[University of Houston]], [[SMU]], and [[TCU]]) and [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] (which Texas A&M played annually until the mid-90's, though A&M's 2012 move to the [[Southeastern Conference]] will most likely renew this rivalry).

Texas A&M values traditions very highly, many of which revolve around the sports in which the school competes.
A few of the athletic traditions of Texas A&M include:
*[[12th Man (Texas A&M)|The 12th Man]] &mdash; The entire student body is referred to as The 12th Man after E. King Gill stood ready to play on the sidelines in 1922.
*[[wikisource:Aggie War Hymn|The Aggie War Hymn]] &mdash; The War Hymn is played at athletic events during the game and after a win.
*[[Aggie Bonfire]] &mdash; Built and burned prior to the annual football game with the [[Texas Longhorn Athletics|University of Texas]].  Bonfire is now an off-campus event after the University cancelled it following the 1999 collapse.
*[[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]] &mdash; The Aggie Band is the largest military-style marching band in the United States and performs at halftime during the football games.
*[[Midnight Yell Practice]] &mdash; Held the night before a home game, the student body gathers at [[Kyle Field]] to excite the crowd.
*[[Yell Leaders]] &mdash; Attending many events, wearing uniforms modeled after a milkman uniform the yell leaders use hand signals to keep the crowd yelling in unison.
*[[Gig 'em]] &mdash; The slogan used by Aggie supporters, often accompanied with a thumbs-up sign, the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference.
*[[Reveille (Texas A&M)|Reveille]] &mdash; The official mascot of Texas A&M since 1931.  Since Reveille II, all A&M mascots have been collies.
*[[Maroon Out]] &mdash; One designated home football game of the year is a "maroon out" game.  All Aggies are instructed to wear maroon.
