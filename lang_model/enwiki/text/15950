The '''buildings of Nuffield College''', one of the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] of the [[University of Oxford]], are to the west of the [[Oxford|city centre]], on the former site of the largely-disused basin of the [[Oxford Canal]]. [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] was founded in 1937 after a donation to the University by the car manufacturer [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]]; he gave not only land for the college but <U+00A3>900,000 (approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|900000|1937|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) to build and endow it. The architect [[Austen Harrison]], who had worked in Greece and Palestine, was appointed by the University to design the buildings. His initial design, heavily influenced by Mediterranean architecture, was rejected by Nuffield, who called it "un-English"<ref name=Colvin174/> and refused to allow his name to be associated with it.  Harrison reworked the plans, aiming for "something on the lines of Cotswold domestic architecture",<ref name=Colvin174/> as Nuffield wanted.

Construction of the second design began in 1949 but was not finished until 1960.  Progress was hampered by post-war building restrictions, and the effects of inflation on Nuffield's donation led to various cost-saving changes to the plans. In one change, the tower, which had been planned to be ornamental, was redesigned to hold the college's library. It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years and is about {{convert|150|ft|m}} tall, including the [[fl<U+00E8>che]] on top. The buildings are arranged around two [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]]s, with residential accommodation for students and [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellows]] in one and the hall, library and administrative offices in the other.  The chapel has [[stained glass]] windows designed by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]].

The architectural historian [[Howard Colvin|Sir Howard Colvin]] said that Harrison's first design was Oxford's "most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s";<ref name=Colvin166/> it has also been described as a "missed opportunity" to show that Oxford did not live "only in the past".<ref name=Richards/> Reaction to the architecture of the college has been largely unfavourable. In the 1960s, it was described as "Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction".<ref name=NewOxford/> The tower, which contains the college library, has been described as "ungainly",<ref name=Tyack301/> and marred by repetitive windows.  The travel writer [[Jan Morris]] said that the college was "a hodge-podge from the start".<ref name=Morris205/> However, the architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]], although unimpressed with most of the college, thought that the tower helped the Oxford skyline and predicted that it would "one day be loved".<ref name=Pevsner65/> The writer [[Simon Jenkins]] doubted Pevsner's prediction, though, saying that "vegetation" was the "best hope" for the tower, and for the rest of the college too.<ref name=Jenkins/>

The history of [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield College]] dates from 16 November 1937, when the [[University of Oxford|university]] entered a Deed of Covenant and Trust with [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|Lord Nuffield]].<ref name=Loveday/> Nuffield, known as William Morris before he was raised to the peerage, was an industrialist and the founder of [[Morris Motors]], which was based in [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]], east Oxford.<ref name=Jenkins/><ref name=Loveday/> For the creation of Nuffield College and for his other donations (which included funding a chair of Spanish studies and donating <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million in 1936<ref group="n"><U+00A3>2,000,000 in 1936 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2000000|1936|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> for a school of medical research),<ref>Hibbert, p. 284</ref> he was described in 1949 by an editorial in ''[[The Times]]'' as "the greatest benefactor of the University since the Middle Ages".<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Times]]|date=22 April 1949|title=Nuffield College|page=5}}</ref> He donated land on New Road, to the west of the city centre near the mound of [[Oxford Castle]], on the site of the largely disused basin of the [[Oxford Canal]].<ref name=Tyack300>Tyack, p. 300</ref> In 1937, ''The Times'' described the half-mile between the [[Oxford railway station|railway station]] and the city (an area including the site of the proposed college) as "something between a refuse heap and a slum";<ref>{{cite news|work=The Times|date=14 October 1937|page=15|title=Lord Nuffield's College}}</ref> Nuffield had originally bought the canal basin to beautify that part of the city before he had the idea of building a college to accomplish this.<ref name=gift>{{cite news|work=The Times|date=14 October 1937|page=11|title=Lord Nuffield's Gift}}</ref> As well as the land, Nuffield gave <U+00A3>900,000<ref group="n"><U+00A3>900,000 in 1937 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|900000|1937|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> to build the college and to provide it with an endowment fund.<ref name=Loveday/>

His plan was to found a college specialising in engineering and business methods to provide a link between academia and industry, for which he initially offered the University <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million;<ref group="n"><U+00A3>1 million in 1937 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|1000000|1937|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> <U+00A3>100,000<ref group="n"><U+00A3>100,000 in 1937 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1937|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> was used for a physical chemistry laboratory (completed in 1941), of which he approved. However, although he was persuaded to put the remainder towards a college for social science studies instead, he still felt "cheated".<ref>Morrell, J. B.

==First design==
[[File:Nuffield College lower quadrangle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|alt=A long pool set in a grass lawn; stone buildings of two and three storeys on three sides|The pool in the lower quadrangle, looking east towards the upper quadrangle and the hall]]Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges ([[William Beveridge|Sir William Beveridge]] from [[University College, Oxford|University College]]; [[Alfred Brotherston Emden|Alfred Emden]] from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]]; and [[Linda Grier]] from [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]]), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work.<ref name=Colvin167>Colvin, p. 167</ref> Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including [[Louis de Soissons]], [[Vincent Harris]], [[Austen Harrison]], [[Charles Holden]], [[Edward Maufe]], and [[Hubert Worthington]]. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17&nbsp;June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified in Britain, he had practised in Greece and Palestine;<ref name=Colvin168>Colvin, p. 168</ref>  Indeed the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later [[University of Ghana]].  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; although Nuffield had agreed to Harrison's appointment, Nuffield was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work.<ref name=Colvin173>Colvin, p. 173</ref> When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the "general idea" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a "beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings".<ref name=gift/> However, this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs.

After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land, on the opposite side of Worcester Street.<ref name=Colvin168/> Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end of the main site, aligned east to west, with a tower at the west end; the upper [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], to the immediate west of the hall and aligned north to south, would have the Warden's Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end; steps would lead down from the upper quadrangle into the lower quadrangle, again aligned east to west, with the main entrance at the far east end of the lower quadrangle. The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street.<ref>Colvin, pp. 169<U+2013>170</ref> The sub-committee recommended that Harrison's plans be adopted in January 1939, and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 <U+2013> he had been abroad for much of the intervening period.<ref name=Hibbert286>Hibbert, p. 286</ref><ref name=Colvin171/>

Harrison's design had "little that was English, still less that was recognisably Oxonian", said the architectural historian [[Howard Colvin|Sir Howard Colvin]].<ref name=Colvin171/> There were no pitched roofs, battlements, or pinnacles.<ref name=Colvin173/> Instead, the proposed building had "a strongly Mediterranean character",<ref name=Colvin171/> inspired by medieval buildings in that region. White [[Portland stone]] was the chosen building material; there were to be "stark" external walls and flat roofs, and a large semi-circular doorway at the main entrance, with facetted [[voussoir]]s demonstrating the influence of the [[Muslim architecture]] of [[Kingdom_of_Sicily#Norman_kingdom|Norman Sicily]]. The tower, which was to have an internal dome and an external [[polygon]]al design, showed (in Colvin's view) influences of [[Byzantium]] and parts of southern France. In the hall, there were to be [[aisle]]s on the north and south sides of the main body of the hall, as in a [[basilica]], with the arches and columns of the aisles designed in a Greek [[Doric order|Doric style]]. The hall and its grand staircase, said Colvin, would have rivalled those of Christ Church. Although Harrison had not finished plans for the [[common room (university)|common room]]s, the initial sketches had oriental touches, including fireplaces reminiscent of the [[Topkap<U+0131> Palace]] in Istanbul. The Warden's Lodging would have been "one of the most handsome and commodious of its kind".<ref name=Colvin171/> However, Colvin thought that the chapel design was better suited to Mediterranean sunlight than Oxford gloom.<ref name=Colvin171/>

Colvin said that the "relationship between the principal buildings" was "elegantly worked out" and, "in a university of self-contained spaces", a design using two intersecting axes&nbsp;<U+2013> one from the entrance to the hall and tower, the other from the chapel to the lodging&nbsp;<U+2013> "represented an innovation in planning that was highly effective".<ref name=Colvin171>Colvin, p.171</ref> Colvin's view was that the failure to construct the college according to this "impressive"<ref name=Colvin171/> design led to it being Oxford's "most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s".<ref name=Colvin166>Colvin, p. 166</ref> Had it been built, he said, it "would have taken its place among the major architectural monuments of Oxford".<ref name=Colvin171/>

==Second design==

Financial constraints led to further changes being made during construction.]]
Nuffield was dismayed by the model of Harrison's plans, as the buildings were not in the general Oxford collegiate style that he was known to favour.<ref name=Colvin173>Colvin, p. 173</ref> After a meeting with the University's Vice-Chancellor, [[A. D. Lindsay]], Nuffield wrote to him on 15&nbsp;August 1939 to say that he felt "obliged to adhere to my adverse judgement of the plans".<ref name=Colvin174>Colvin, p. 174</ref> The design was "un-English and out of keeping with the best tradition of Oxford architecture", said Nuffield, adding that "if a building of this type were to be erected, I would not allow my name to be associated therewith".<ref name=Colvin174/>

Harrison protested that the so-called Oxford architectural tradition was a vague concept and also an accident of history: there was no uniform style uniting the buildings of the university and colleges, but instead different designs had been used, with varying modifications, over many centuries. Only a compromise would suit "a 20th century donor with an industrial background who sighs for romance, a committee of economists who are after results [and] the governing committee of a University steeped in its tradition".<ref name=Colvin174/> Nevertheless, Harrison agreed to attempt to satisfy Nuffield's desire for "something on the lines of [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]] domestic architecture",<ref name=Colvin174/> and produced a second design. The amount of accommodation provided was reduced. The main entrance was moved from the west to the south of the college, under the chapel; it was to have an arcaded vestibule, allowing the quadrangle to be seen from the street, as Nuffield wanted. The flat roofs were replaced with pitched roofs with [[gable]] ends and [[dormer window]]s. The staircase leading to the hall was removed, and the hall repositioned on ground level, without aisles but with a [[hammerbeam roof]] of oak trusses. The tower, which would now contain the common room, was moved from the area of the former hall staircase to the east end of the chapel.<ref>Colvin, pp. 174<U+2013>175</ref> When the plans were shown to Nuffield in early 1940, the only change that he requested before giving his approval was for a "more conventional" tower to replace the spire on Harrison's design.<ref name=Colvin175>Colvin, p. 175</ref>

==Construction and completion==

The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21&nbsp;April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948.<ref name=Loveday>Loveday</ref><ref name=October/> Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on [[Banbury Road]] and [[Woodstock Road]].<ref name=October>{{cite news|work=The Times|title=Building Nuffield College|date=18 October 1948|page=3}}</ref> There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation.<ref name=Colvin175/><ref>Tyack, p. 300</ref> A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was underway, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper [[fl<U+00E8>che]], or small spire.<ref name=Colvin175/><ref name=IOE/>

A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Times|title=Delay In Building Of Nuffield College|date=8&nbsp;September 1951|page=6}}</ref> Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of <U+00A3>200,000.<ref group="n"><U+00A3>200,000 in 1955 would be worth approximately <U+00A3>{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|200000|1955|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}.</ref> This money was donated to the college by the [[Nuffield Foundation]] upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation.<ref name=Hibbert286/> Until it was required for books, the [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellows]] of the college used the upper floor as a [[Senior Common Room]].<ref name=Skyline>{{cite news|work=The Times|title=Addition To Oxford Skyline|date=7 November 1955|page=4}}</ref> The tower was completed in 1956,<ref name=Colvin175/> and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park)<ref>Tyack, pp. 300<U+2013>301</ref> was finished in 1960.<ref name=Pevsner67/> Work was still underway when the college was incorporated by [[royal charter]] in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Times|page=4|date=7 June 1958|title=New Charters Presented}}</ref> The charter was presented to the college by the [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] on 6&nbsp;June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.<ref name=Hibbert286/>

Colvin commented that, apart from the fl<U+00E8>che which was similar to the 1940 plan, the college as finally built contained none of the elements that had given Harrison's first design "interest and distinction".<ref name=Colvin177>Colvin, p. 177</ref> The remaining "vestiges" of the first plan, he said, were the two main axes within the college, although "no longer focussed on major architectural incidents", and the masonry around the main doors, cut to resemble the buildings of medieval Italy rather than those of Tudor England.<ref name=Colvin177/>

The architectural writer Geoffrey Tyack has written that Nuffield College was Oxford's "most important architectural project of the immediate post-war years".<ref name=Tyack299>Tyack, p. 299</ref> Opinions about the architecture merits of the college have varied, although most have been unfavourable. The authors of a 1961 booklet on the architecture of modern Oxford said that it was "Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction".<ref name=NewOxford>Smith, p. 28</ref> The Cotswold style was "taken absurdly out of context and mercilessly stretched", and did not "harmonise with the clumsy tower", whilst the spire "[perched] uneasily&nbsp;... despite its elaborate base".<ref name=NewOxford/> An unnamed journalist wrote in ''The Times'' in 1959 that the main buildings of the quadrangles were "somewhat oddly wedded to small basins which irresistibly suggest a Lilliputian Versailles".<ref name=Newwave>{{cite news|title=New Wave Of Building At Oxford|work=The Times|date=23 October 1959|page=5}}</ref> The same writer said that the tower rose "Manhattan-wise for 10 storeys through the twentieth century, only to have a diminutive spire, escaped from the fifteenth, push through its top to steal the last laugh".<ref name=Newwave/> Peter Sager, too, thought that the "high-rise library" could "easily stand on the Hudson".<ref name=Sager/> Sir Howard Colvin said that the "utilitarian function" of the tower "accorded ill with its original ornamental purpose", and that the architects had "failed to find a satisfactory solution" to the "repetitive uniformity of fenestration".<ref name=Colvin175/>  Of the fl<U+00E8>che, Colvin said that it "makes its contribution to the Oxford skyline without any overt reference to historical precedent".<ref name=Colvin175/> Geoffrey Tyack also disliked the tower, describing it as "an ungainly structure" that was "lit by a monotonous array of windows punched out of the wall surface"; however, he thought the hall was "an effective reinterpretation of the traditional collegiate pattern".<ref name=Tyack301>Tyack, p. 301</ref> The writer Miles Jebb considered the contrast between the hall's black and white floor and red-panelled roof to be "most effective".<ref name=Jebb153/> He thought that the enclosed layout of the college was "a principal attraction", but wrote that the tower's "palpably utilitarian function detracts from its aesthetic attraction", even though it made the "emphatic addition" to the skyline of Oxford that Nuffield wanted.<ref name=Jebb153/>

The architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] compared the college unfavourably to the designs of the Danish architect [[Arne Jacobsen]]  for [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]], construction of which began in 1960 (the year that Nuffield College was completed): St Catherine's, in his view, was "the most perfect piece of architecture of 20th-century Oxford" and made Nuffield "look even more absurd".<ref name=Pevsner67>Pevsner, p. 67</ref> Nevertheless, he "proposed forgiveness" for the "mighty tower", which "positively helps the famous skyline of Oxford", adding that it has "enough identity to be sure that one day it will find affection".<ref name=Pevsner235>Pevsner, p. 235</ref> He said that the tower had something of the architect [[Edwin Lutyens]]' "felicitous manipulation of period details into a non-period whole and will, I prophesy, one day be loved", although he was less sure that this fate awaited the rest of the buildings.<ref name=Pevsner65>Pevsner, p. 65</ref> Simon Jenkins said of Pevsner's prophesy about the tower, "I doubt it"; he described it as "at best ungainly", with a "weak spire", and said that "vegetation was its best hope, as for the rest of Nuffield".<ref name=Jenkins/> The college, in his view "required a sense of humour".<ref name=Jenkins>Jenkins, p. 686</ref>

Richards]], the editor of the ''[[Architectural Review]]'', said that Nuffield was "a large-scale example of period-style architecture which has no justification whatever on grounds of consideration for the neighbours and represents missed opportunity of a really tragic kind".<ref name=Richards/> As the site was away from the "ancient colleges" of the city centre and in an area of "undistinguished nineteenth century commercial building", there had been a "rare opportunity" of building something "belonging&nbsp;... to the twentieth century, and of showing that Oxford does not live only in the past".<ref name=Richards/> He said that the "compromise between contemporary needs and what is imagined to be the English collegiate tradition is quite unworthy of the educational enterprise the new foundation represents".<ref name=Richards/> He was, however, "thankful" that the building used smooth-faced stone "in the proper Oxford style" rather than rubble facing, which he said had been used elsewhere in Oxford "with extraordinarily unpleasing results".<ref name=Richards>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=J. M.|journal=Architectural Review|title=Recent Building in Oxford & Cambridge|page=p. 75|date=August 1952|volume=CXII|number=668|location=London|publisher=The Architectural Press}}</ref>

The architectural correspondent of ''The Times'' wrote that the architecture of the college was incongruous <U+2013> it was "remarkable" that a college with connections to modern industry should be looking backwards in this way.  "That a college devoted to modern scientific studies should be dressed up [in the style of an antique Cotswold manor house] has already been the subject of puzzled comment by many foreign visitors to Oxford."<ref>{{cite news|work=The Times|date=23 April 1959|title=The Industrialist as Patron|page=3}}</ref> Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Patience Gray]] also disliked the college's design, referring to the "Cotswold dementia" of the architecture, and the college's "pokey windows and grotesque sugarloaf tower."<ref name=Gray>{{cite news|work=The Observer|date=17 April 1960|last=Gray|first=Patience|page=15|title=Students At Home}}</ref> The chapel was described by the travel writer [[Jan Morris]] as "one of the sweetest little sanctuaries in Oxford";<ref name=Morris216>Morris, p. 216</ref> "very simple, almost stern" with a contrast between the black and white pews and the "rich colour" of the stained glass.<ref name=Morris216/> However, she said that whilst Oxford colleges change in style over time as buildings are added or altered, "Nuffield was a hodge-podge from the start, with a faintly Levantine tower upon a Cotswold Gothic base".<ref name=Morris205>Morris, p. 205</ref>

In 1993, the college became a Grade II [[listed building]], a designation given to buildings of national importance and special interest.<ref name=IOE>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=246019|title=Nuffield College, New Road, Oxford|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=28 September 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref><ref name=EH>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.1373|title=Listed buildings|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=28 September 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> The kerbstones around the pool in the west quadrangle have been given their own separate Grade II listing, as an "integral part of the Nuffield College scheme".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=246020|title=Nuffield College, kerbstones surrounding pool|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=28 September 2009|dateformat=dmy}}</ref>
