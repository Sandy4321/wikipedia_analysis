'''Henri Toivonen''' ([[August 25]], [[1956]] &ndash; [[May 2]], [[1986]]) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[rallying|rally]] driver born in [[Jyv<U+00E4>skyl<U+00E4>]], the home of [[Rally Finland]]. His father, [[Pauli Toivonen]], was the 1968 European Rally Champion for [[Porsche]] and his brother, [[Harri Toivonen]], became a professional [[circuit racing|circuit racer]]. 

Toivonen took his first [[World Rally Championship]] victory with a [[Chrysler Sunbeam|Talbot Sunbeam Lotus]] at the [[1980 World Rally Championship season|1980]] [[Lombard RAC Rally]] in [[Great Britain]], when he had just turned 24&nbsp;years old. He is still the [[List of World Rally Championship records|youngest driver ever to win a world rally]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Henri Toivonen's profile | work=Rally Paradise | url=http://www.nic.fi/~globe1/rally/paradise/stat/prof_toivonen_henri.htm | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> Toivonen's next big success came with [[Lancia]]. In [[1985 World Rally Championship season|1985]], he was finally signed up for a full WRC programme, but ended up nearly paralysed early on at a rally in [[Costa Smeralda]]. He returned to rallying the same year, winning the last event of the season, the RAC Rally, as well as the [[1986 World Rally Championship season|1986 season]] opener, the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], which his father had won exactly 20&nbsp;years earlier.<ref name="Historic Racing">{{cite web | title=Henri Toivonen | work=Historic Racing | url=http://www.historicracing.com/top100.cfm?driverID=2339 | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref>

Toivonen, driving a [[Lancia Delta S4]], died in a mysterious accident on [[May 2]], [[1986]] at the [[Tour de Corse]] rally of [[Corsica]], while leading both the event and the championship. His [[United States|American]] co-driver, [[Sergio Cresto]], also died as the Delta S4 plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal accident had no witnesses and the remains of the Lancia were merely blackened [[spaceframe]], making it impossible to determine the cause of the accident.<ref name="Post 14">{{cite web | author=Maruszewska, Witolda | title=Henri Toivonen biography | work=Post 14 | url=http://www.thruxton.f9.co.uk/henri/henri_career.htm | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> Within hours of the accident, [[Jean-Marie Balestre]], the President of the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]], banned the powerful [[Group B]] rally cars from competing for the next season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.<ref name="Autosport 40th Ann">{{cite journal | title=40th Anniversary Supplement - On the death of Henri Toivonen | journal=[[Autosport]] | url=http://www.thruxton.f9.co.uk/henri/henri_print.htm | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Focus on safety in aftermath of Park death | work=[[Eurosport]] | url=http://www.eurosport.com/home/pages/v4/l0/s42/e9240/sport_lng0_spo42_evt9240_sto767434.shtml | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref>

Although Toivonen is remembered for his exuberant driving style on gravel, he started his career in circuit racing and was very competitive also on tarmac. During the 1986 [[Rally of Portugal]], he drove his Delta S4 rally car at the [[Aut<U+00F3>dromo do Estoril|Estoril]] track, and it is often reported that his fastest lap time would have qualified him in sixth position at that year's [[Formula One]] [[1986 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]].<ref name="Sligo Weekender">{{cite web | author=Cullen, John | title=Petrolheads: Too fast to stay | work=[[Sligo Weekender]] | url=http://www.sligoweekender.ie/news/story.asp?j=7119 | accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Biggs, Henry | title=Top 10: greatest-ever Lancias | work=[[MSN]] Cars UK | url=http://cars.uk.msn.com/News/Top_ten_article.aspx?cp-documentid=1397553 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> [[Eddie Jordan]], in whose [[Formula Three]] team Toivonen made a few guest appearances, claimed he was certain that Toivonen would have become a winner in Formula One and compared his performances to [[Ayrton Senna]].<ref name="VM">{{cite web | title=Flying Finn: H<U+00E4>ik<U+00E4>isev<U+00E4> Henri Toivonen | work=Vauhdin Maailma | url=http://www.vauhdinmaailma.fi/teaser.jsp?teaserid=74&mag_id=23 | accessdate=2006-11-14 | language=Finnish}}</ref> The annual [[Race of Champions]], which was originally organised in Toivonen's memory,<ref>{{cite web | author=Phillips, David | title=Who's the Best? | work=[[Speed TV]] | url=http://www.speedtv.com/commentary/14264/ | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> awards the winning individual driver the ''Henri Toivonen Memorial Trophy''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Vrignaud, St<U+00E9>phane | title=Formules de comp<U+00E9>titions | work=[[Eurosport]] | url=http://www.eurosport.fr/sportsmecaniques/race-of-champions/2006/sport_sto997542.shtml | accessdate=2006-11-14 | language=French}}</ref>

==Early career==
[[Image:Pauli and Henri Toivonen.jpg|frame|Pauli and Henri Toivonen.]]
Toivonen learnt to drive when he was five years old.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Deinel, H; Klein, R; Lizin, M; Williams, D | title=Henri Toivonen feature | journal=Rally | url=http://www.thruxton.f9.co.uk/henri/henri_print.htm | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> At that time, his father, [[Pauli Toivonen]], was becoming very successful in international rallying. Pauli Toivonen would go on to win the [[Monte Carlo Rally|Monte Carlo]], [[1000 Lakes Rally|1000 Lakes]] and [[Acropolis Rally|Acropolis]] rallies and become the 1968 European Rally Champion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Pauli Toivonen | work=The Flying Finns | url=http://www.flyingfinns.com/toiv_p.htm | accessdate=2006-11-24}}</ref> Although he was born in [[Jyv<U+00E4>skyl<U+00E4>]], the city that has hosted the [[Rally Finland]] since 1951, and his father was connected with the rallying scene, Henri Toivonen started his career in [[karting]] and continued in [[circuit racing]] in his early years. He won the Finnish Cup in [[Touring car racing|touring cars]] and then switched to Formula V. In his first year in formulae, he managed to win one round of the [[Scandinavia]]n Championship. Toivonen graduated to Formula Super-V the next year and won a round of the European Championship, also becoming the 1977 Finnish Champion in the Formula Vee class. Under pressure from his family about the safety of circuit racing, he decided to switch to rallying full time.<ref name="Post 14"/> Toivonen's [[go-kart]] was purchased by parents of a 6-year-old [[Mika H<U+00E4>kkinen]], and it became the first of its kind for the future two-time [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One World Drivers' Champion]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Gagnon, Marie-Julie | title=Le fil de Mika | work=[[Radio Canada]] | url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/Branche/v4/93/F1.htm | accessdate=2006-11-14 | language=French}}</ref>

Due to Finnish legislation on new drivers at the time, which limited the top speed on open road to 80&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour]], Toivonen could not compete in rallying until he was 19 years old.<ref name="Post 14"/> Partnered with Antero Linquist, he made his rally debut in 1975. Within the same year, he competed in his first [[World Rally Championship]] event at the [[1000 Lakes Rally]], now known as ''Neste Oil Rally Finland'', driving a privately entered [[Simca]] Rallye 2. He had to retire from the rally during the 36th special stage due to a broken [[sump]].<ref>{{cite web | title=25th 1000 Lakes Rally | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=364 | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> Two years later in only his second world rally, he managed a fifth place at [[1977 World Rally Championship season|that year's]] 1000 Lakes in a [[Chrysler Avenger]].<ref name="RallyBase">{{cite web | title=Henri Toivonen | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=profile&driverid=3524 | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> In the [[1978 World Rally Championship season|1978 season]], Toivonen started his season at the [[Arctic Rally]], the round two of both the European Rally Championship and World Rally Championship's "[[FIA]] Cup for Drivers", the unofficial World Rally Championship for Drivers. By finishing second, 3:41&nbsp;minutes behind [[Ari Vatanen]], he placed over seven minutes ahead [[Markku Al<U+00E9>n]],<ref>{{cite web | title=13th Arctic Rally | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=643 | accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> who would go on to win the Cup.<ref>{{cite web | title=1978 FIA Cup for Rally Drivers | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=standing&standingid=fiacd1978 | accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> Toivonen went on to compete in two world rallies for [[Citro<U+00EB>n]]. Although he did not finish either one of the events, his driving did not go unnoticed. Private [[Porsche]] team offered Toivonen a car for the 1000 Lakes Rally, and [[Chrysler]] did the same for the [[Lombard RAC Rally]]. At his home event, Toivonen had to retire due to an engine failure, but at the RAC Rally, he drove to a ninth place finish.<ref name="RallyBase"/> That same year, Toivonen captured his first rally win at the Nordic Rally, an event in the Finnish Rally Championship. In the [[1979 World Rally Championship season|1979 season]], he concentrated on gathering rallying experience by competing in 15 rallies in the British, Finnish and European championships. Toivonen also competed in two WRC events; at the 1000 Lakes with a [[Fiat 131|Fiat 131 Abarth]] and at the RAC with a [[Ford Escort|Ford Escort RS]], but retired in both. However, at his home event he was matching the pace of the leaders before leaving the road.<ref name="The Complete Book">{{cite book | last=Hope-Frost | first=Henry | coauthors=John Davenport | year=2004 | title=The Complete Book of the World Rally Championships: The First 30 Years | publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company | id=ISBN 0-7603-1954-5 | pages=p. 165}}</ref> These performances then led to a seat at the [[Talbot]] Competition team for the [[1980 World Rally Championship season|1980 season]].

==Works career==
===Talbot (1980-81)===
The Talbot factory team contract meant the advent of Toivonen's first "works" season, and 1980 was largely a trial year for him. He started the season by winning the [[Arctic Rally]] in January,<ref name="The Complete Book"/> but only drove his [[Talbot Sunbeam|Talbot Sunbeam Lotus]] in four selected [[World Rally Championship]] events. Due to his exuberant driving style that often led to crashes, his results were not often representative of his pace.<ref name="Autosport">{{cite journal | title=Interview with Henri Toivonen | journal=[[Autosport]] | volume=81 | issue=7 | date=[[November 13]], [[1980]] | url=http://www.thruxton.f9.co.uk/henri/henri_print.htm | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> At the [[1000 Lakes Rally]], Toivonen retired due to an accident during the 11th special stage.<ref>{{cite web | title=30th 1000 Lakes Rally | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=294 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> In hopes of better results by finding a suitable co-driver for him, the team kept trying out different co-drivers by switching Toivonen's partner between Antero Lindquist, Paul White and Neil Wilson.<ref name="Post 14"/> At the next rally in [[San Remo Rally|San Remo]] with Lindquist, Toivonen drove his Talbot to a fifth place.<ref>{{cite web | title=22<U+00BA> Rallye Sanremo | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=296 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> Later, partnered by White, who Toivonen called "Chalkie" due to his last name,<ref>{{cite web | author=Maruszewska, Witolda | title=Henri Toivonen references | work=Post 14 | url=http://www.thruxton.f9.co.uk/henri/henri_source.htm | accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> surprised both experts and spectators by winning the [[Lombard RAC Rally]] in late November, over four minutes ahead of [[Hannu Mikkola]].<ref>{{cite web | title=29th Lombard RAC Rally | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=298 | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> Neither Toivonen nor Talbot were expected to competitive in the rally.<ref>{{cite web | title=Lombard-RAC Rally 1980 | work=Sunbeam Lotus Owners Club | url=http://www.sunbeamlotus.com/Public/BodyPages/Lombard.html | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> In an interview published in [[Autosport]] three days before the rally started, even Toivonen himself did not expect to challenge for the win:

<blockquote>"I don<U+2019>t think that I have done enough events to win the rally just by driving skill, for instance. If I win, it will be because I have a little bit of luck and some of the others have trouble. I mean, Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like the back of his hand so there is no use trying to drive to beat him. You have to wait for him to have trouble. Then you are in with a chance."<ref name="Autosport"/></blockquote>

Being only 24&nbsp;years old, he was and still is the youngest driver ever to win a WRC event. [[Markku Al<U+00E9>n]] had earlier won his first world rally at 24, and later [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Duval]] achieved the same five days before his 25th birthday in [[2005 World Rally Championship season|2005]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Telstra Rally Australia - Fran<U+00E7>ois the First! | work=[[Citro<U+00EB>n]] | url=http://www.citroen.com.cn/CCW/citroen/en/News/SportNews/WRC/WRC+Australia+En.htm?channel=0 | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> When Paul White commented over twenty years after the event, he said that he still receives questions about the rally and Henri Toivonen. He noted the Talbot team, ran by Des O'Dell and 15 full-time personnel, was very small compared to others and "had to draft in 'mercenary' mechanics to help."<ref>{{cite book | last=Gardiner | first=Tony | year=2005 | title=RAC Rally Action!: From the 60s, 70s and 80s | publisher= Veloce Publishing Ltd | id=ISBN 1-903706-97-1 | pages=p. 158}}</ref> Toivonen's results led to another year in the Talbot squad. In the [[1981 World Rally Championship season|1981 season]], he was signed up for a larger WRC programme and had a new co-driver, Fred Gallagher, who would later partner [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Bj<U+00F6>rn Waldeg<U+00E5>rd]] in a [[Toyota Celica|Toyota Celica Turbo]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Fred Gallagher - WRC starts | work=World Rally Archive | url=http://www.juwra.com/gallagher_fred_starts.html | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> Toivonen's [[rear-wheel drive]] [[Group A|Group 2]] Talbot Sunbeam was now outdated compared to the new [[Group B]] cars, but with second places at [[Rally Portugal]] and San Remo, as well as a fifth place at the [[Monte Carlo Rally]], Toivonen's seven WRC outings resulted in a seventh place overall in the [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|World Rally Drivers' Championship]].<ref>{{cite web | title=1981 World Rally Championship for Drivers | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=standing&standingid=wcd1981 | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> He also competed in the last round of the British Rally Championship, Audi Sport International Rally, and won the event.<ref name="Post 14"/>

===Opel (1982-83)===
[[Image:Henri Toivonen - Opel Manta 400.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Toivonen driving the [[Opel Manta|Opel Manta 400]].]]
In the [[1982 World Rally Championship season|1982 season]], Toivonen switched to the [[Rothmans]]-sponsored [[Opel]] team and drove the [[Opel Ascona|Ascona 400]]. Opel was co-managed by [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] who had won the World Rally Championship as a co-driver for [[Ari Vatanen]] a year earlier, and would go on to form [[Prodrive]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web | author=Saward, Joe | title=David Lapworth (Prodrive) | work=GrandPrix.com | url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft17090.html | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> Toivonen's team mates were Vatanen, the 1980 World Rally Champion [[Walter R<U+00F6>hrl]] and [[Jimmy McRae]], previous year's British Rally Champion and father of future rally star [[Colin McRae]]. Toivonen had problems adopting to the new car and competed in only five WRC events, but finished on the podium twice, at the [[Acropolis Rally]] and at the [[RAC Rally]].<ref name="RallyBase"/> In the European Rally Championship, he participated in four rallies gathering a score of three podiums and one retirement. He also made a guest appearance in one round of the [[British Formula Three Championship]], and finished tenth with a [[Ralt]] RT3.<ref name="Post 14"/> 

In the [[1983 World Rally Championship season|1983 season]], Toivonen continued with Opel now driving the [[Opel Manta|Manta 400]]. Manta 400 was a [[Group B]] car, but it was underpowered against the likes of [[Audi Quattro|Audi Quattro A2]] and [[Lancia 037]], which were controlling the world rally scene at the time. Toivonen achieved a win at the Manx International Rally in the [[Isle of Man]], at his first attempt. He also finished first at the Mille Pistes rally in [[France]], but the organisers decided to ban the Group B cars halfway through the event. Toivonen and his co-driver, Ian Gindrod, were forced to settle for a consolation trophy.<ref name="Post 14"/> His best results in the World Rally Championship were a sixth place at the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] and a fourth place at the [[San Remo Rally]].<ref name="RallyBase"/> He also drove a [[Ferrari 308 GTB]] at the San Marino Rally but retired from the race. At that rally, he was co-driven by Juha Piironen for the first time. Piironen would become his main co-driver for the next two seasons, and later have a long and successful partnership with future four-time World Rally Champion [[Juha Kankkunen]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Juha Piironen | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=profile&driverid=2806 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> In late October, Toivonen competed in two [[Sportscar racing|sportscar]] races, driving a [[Porsche 956]] for Richard Lloyd Racing in the [[World Endurance Championship]]. Partnered with [[Derek Bell (auto racer)|Derek Bell]] and [[Jonathan Palmer]], he finished fourth at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] and third in the next race at [[Mugello]].<ref>{{cite web | title=European Championship - Sport 1983 | work=WSPR Racing | url=http://wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/mes/mesport1983.html | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref>

===Porsche (1984)===
After a score of ten starts, two podiums and five retirements, Toivonen left Opel Team Europe for the [[1984 World Rally Championship season|1984 season]]. He was linked to be the lead driver in the new [[Peugeot 205|Peugeot 205 T16]] for the [[Peugeot]] [[Talbot]] squad. However, he signed up to drive a [[Porsche 911]] for the [[Rothmans]]-sponsored [[Porsche]] factory team in the European Rally Championship. The team was run by [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] and his new motorsport group, [[Prodrive]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Heselwood, Jeff | title=On the fast track to success | work=[[Cargonews Asia]] | url=http://cargonewsasia.com/timesnet/data/ab/docs/ab1376.html | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> Toivonen also drove for [[Martini Racing|Lancia Martini]] who offered him a [[Lancia 037]] for three WRC events. His European season with Porsche turned out to be a success. He started with two retirements, a third and a second place, but went on to win five rallies in a row, and despite missing several events due to ill health,<ref name="Post 14"/> he finished second in the championship, narrowly losing the title to [[Italy|Italian]] Lancia driver [[Carlo Capone]].<ref>{{cite web | title=1984: Audi's revenge | work=Lancia rally 037 | url=http://www.lanciarally037.com/e-classifica84.htm | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> In the World Rally Championship, he competed in only three events. His best result was third at his home event, [[1000 Lakes Rally]].<ref>{{cite web | title=34th 1000 Lakes Rally | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=248 | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> With these results, Toivonen consolidated his reputation as one of the most talented drivers in international rallying.<ref>{{cite book | last=Henry | first=Alan | year=2005 | title=Driven Man: David Richards, Prodrive, and the Race to Win | publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company | id=ISBN 0-7603-2175-2 | pages=p. 50}}</ref> He stayed with the Lancia team for the [[1985 World Rally Championship season|1985 season]].

===Lancia (1985-86)===
[[Image:037Rallye.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lancia 037]] at the 2005 Historic Motorsport Show at Stoneleigh, West Midlands.]]
The 1985 season did not start well, as Toivonen crashed his [[Lancia 037]] into a brick wall at the Costa Smeralda Rally, an event in the European Rally Championship, causing himself a serious back injury and breaking three [[vertebrae]] in his neck.<ref name="Post 14"/> Later, Toivonen and fellow team mate [[Markku Al<U+00E9>n]] lost a friend and co-Lancia driver, when [[Attilio Bettega]] had a fatal crash during the fourth special stage at the [[Tour de Corse]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Vauhdin Maailma 1980 | work=Vauhdin Maailma | url=http://www.vauhdinmaailma.fi/vmextra.jsp?showid=11 | accessdate=2006-11-14 | language=Finnish}}</ref> After recovering from his injuries, Toivonen made a comeback at his home event, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]], in August and finished fourth.

The [[1986 World Rally Championship season|1986 season]] saw a great start for Toivonen. He took a dominant win at the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] with a new co-driver [[Sergio Cresto]].

==Death==
[[Image:Henri Toivonen - Lancia Delta S4.jpg|thumb|250px|After the accident, only the blackened space frame remained of Toivonen's [[Lancia Delta S4]].]]
The 1986 [[Tour de Corse]], a world rally around the island of [[Corsica]], began on Thursday, [[May 1]]. Toivonen had a [[sore throat]] and was suffering from [[flu]], but he insisted on driving after having his championship lead reduce in the last two rallies. According to several sources, he was also taking medicine to treat [[fever]]. Regardless of his ill health, he was taking stage win after stage win and leading the rally by a large margin.<ref name="MTV3"/> After day one, the first [[Leg (rallying)|leg]], Toivonen commented on the event:

<blockquote>"This rally is insane, even though everything is going well at the moment. If there will be trouble, I'm as good as dead." (Original [[Finnish language|Finnish]] quote: "T<U+00E4>m<U+00E4> ralli on mielet<U+00F6>n, vaikka kaikki meneekin nyt hyvin. Jos tulee ongelmia, olen mennytt<U+00E4>.")<ref name="MTV3"/></blockquote>

Toivonen was complaining about the car being too powerful for a rally like the Tour de Corse. He found it very hard to keep the car balanced on the road and admitted it was very exhausting. In a short interview before he steered his Lancia on the 18th stage, Toivonen made a comment which would remain his last words in public:

<blockquote>"We have today driven the equivalent of a full [[Rally Finland|Jysk<U+00E4>l<U+00E4>]]. It's hard to keep up with the speed." ("Me ollaan t<U+00E4>n<U+00E4><U+00E4>n jo ajettu yhden kokonaisen Jysk<U+00E4>l<U+00E4>n verran. Ei siin<U+00E4> meinaa p<U+00E4><U+00E4> pysy<U+00E4> mukana.")<ref name="VM"/></blockquote>

During the second leg, on Friday, [[May 2]], at the seventh kilometre of the 18th stage, [[Corte]] - Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia went off the side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and landed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded.<ref name="Post 14"/> The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. This incident happened within seconds and Toivonen and his co-driver, [[Sergio Cresto]] were trapped and did not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4 was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. The car's bodywork was made of [[kevlar]]-reinforced plastic composite which burnt readily.<ref name="Sligo Weekender"/> Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja and two young children; son Markus and daughter Arla. Cresto was single and had no children. 

Toivonen's accident remains a mystery to this day as it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, it proved to be impossible to determine the cause of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the accident. Toivonen's team started to expect something might have happened only after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule.<ref name="Post 14"/> The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the accident scene, they could only put down the flames, which were fanned by a breeze. Lancia engineers and technicians could not determine the cause for the accident, as the remains of the car were so charred. [[Walter R<U+00F6>hrl]] later confirmed that Toivonen was taking medicine for his flu, but the cause of the accident is still unknown.<ref name="Post 14"/>

===Aftermath===
Within hours of Toivonen's accident, [[Jean-Marie Balestre]] and the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale du Sport Automobile|FISA]] decided to ban [[Group B]] cars from competing for the 1987 season.<ref name="Autosport 40th Ann"/> The planned Group S was also cancelled and manufacturers got stuck with cars they could not race.<ref>{{cite web | title=Audi Groupe S <U+00E0> moteur central (Sport quattro RS 002) | work=Audi Passion | url=http://www.audipassion.com/univers_audi/concept_cars/groupe_s/index.php | accessdate=2006-11-15 | language=French}}</ref> [[Audi]] and [[Ford]] withdrew from Group B racing immediately, but other teams competed until the end of the season. The Tour de Corse was continued the next day and [[Bruno Saby]] took the win with his [[Peugeot 205|Peugeot 205 Turbo 16 E2]].<ref>{{cite web | title=30<U+00E8>me Tour de Corse - Rallye de France | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=219 | accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref> FISA was criticised for concentrating too much on [[Formula One]], and not noticing how fast and uncontrollable the rally cars had become.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rallying after Group B | work=MotorSportsLive | url=http://www.motorsportslive.gr/default.asp?lng=uk&pg=wrc&spg=wrc_groupbhistory | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> Toivonen's [[Lancia Delta S4]] could accelerate from 0-60&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] (96&nbsp;[[Kilometres per hour|kmh]]) in 2.3&nbsp;seconds, on a gravel road.<ref>{{cite web | author=Biggs, Henry | title=Top 10: Group B rally cars | work=[[MSN]] Cars UK | url=http://cars.uk.msn.com/News/car_news_article.aspx?cp-documentid=475269 | accessdate=2007-02-07}}</ref> A FISA investigation, later proved, that drivers' reactions were indeed too slow to keep up with the speed of the Group B cars. Drivers' eyes could not adjust their focus between the fast corners, which resulted in [[tunnel vision]].<ref name="Sligo Weekender"/> However, due to the high speed of the cars, rallying was more popular among spectators than ever. FISA had to face criticism also for overreacting to Toivonen's accident. John Davenport, former rally driver and author of ''The Complete Book of the World Rally Championship'', claimed in 2004 that "Group B could have been tamed. They were only unsafe in so much as the fuel system, which caused Toivonen's death, and the crowd control needed changing <U+2013> it wasn't the actual cars."<ref>{{cite web | title=The WRC - looking back over 30 years. | work=Crash.net | url=http://www.crash.net/news_view~cid~4~id~99842~pid~1.htm | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref> Group B cars have been described as "too fast to race."<ref>{{cite web | title=1986 Ford RS200 Evolution | work=Supercars.net | url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/3554.html | accessdate=2006-11-27}}</ref>

Toivonen's car at the Tour de Corse carried number four. A year earlier, [[Attilio Bettega]] carried the same number at the same rally at the exact same date and also died in an accident.<ref>{{cite web | title=29<U+00E8>me Tour de Corse - Rallye de France | work=RallyBase | url=http://www.rallybase.nl/index.php?type=result&rallyid=232 | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> The number was subsequently banned from cars in the Tour de Corse until it reappeared in the [[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]] event. The rally has since proved to be a tricky venue. During the 1997 event, [[Tommi M<U+00E4>kinen]] hit a cow at 150&nbsp;kilometres per hour. His [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution|Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV]] plunged into a ravine and rolled 50&nbsp;metres down a slope. Although the car was completely wrecked, both M<U+00E4>kinen and his co-driver Seppo Harjanne were unharmed. The incident, however, brought back memories from Toivonen's accident.<ref>{{cite web | title=Tour de Corse '97 | work=World Rallying | url=http://www.worldrally.net/97/corse97.html | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> M<U+00E4>kinen had another bad accident in [[2001 World Rally Championship season|2001]], when he crashed his then-new [[Mitsubishi]] into a mountain badly injuring his co-driver Risto Mannisenm<U+00E4>ki.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rallye de France | work=World Rally Archive | url=http://www.juwra.com/corsica.html | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> However, Toivonen's death is still the last fatality for drivers in the World Rally Championship.<ref>{{cite web | title= Subaru boss wants radical reforms | work=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/world_rally/4259762.stm | accessdate=2006-11-15}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Toivonen was known as a competitive driver both on gravel and tarmac surfaces, as he started in [[circuit racing]] and found it difficult to choose between circuits and [[rallying]].<ref name="VM"/> After becoming a rally driver, he still raced in some circuit racing events, competing successfully in two [[World Endurance Championship]] events and also in a few races for [[Eddie Jordan]]'s [[British Formula Three Championship]] team. Jordan called Toivonen's performances "incredible" and compared him to [[Ayrton Senna]].<ref name="VM"/> After Toivonen's death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: <blockquote>"I don't know if he would have become a champion in Formula One. It always takes a lot of luck, too, and now afterwards one can doubt if he would have been granted that. But he would have won Grands Prix &ndash; for that I'm absolutely sure." ("En tied<U+00E4>, olisiko h<U+00E4>nest<U+00E4> tullut formula ykk<U+00F6>siss<U+00E4> maailmanmestaria. Siihen tarvitaan aina paljon onneakin ja n<U+00E4>in j<U+00E4>lkik<U+00E4>teen voi ep<U+00E4>ill<U+00E4>, ett<U+00E4> sit<U+00E4> h<U+00E4>nelle ei ehk<U+00E4> ollut suotu. Mutta GP-kisoja h<U+00E4>n olisi voittanut <U+2013> siit<U+00E4> olen t<U+00E4>ysin varma.")<ref name="VM"/></blockquote>

During his [[World Rally Championship]] career, Toivonen competed in 40 world rallies, gathering three wins, 11 podium places, 183 stage wins and retiring 22 times.<ref>{{cite web | title=Henri Toivonen | work=World Rally Archive | url=http://www.juwra.com/toivonen_henri.html | accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> He died at the peak of his career, leading the championship and the [[Tour de Corse]]. With only wins and retirements in the last seven rallies, he seemed invincible in the [[Lancia Delta S4]], after finally finding a car that is both competitive and suitable for his driving style. However, Toivonen admitted having problems with the car: "I may have won the RAC Rally with Lancia, but I just did not know how to drive it. It seemed to have a mind of its own."<ref name="Motor"/> [[Lancia]] team boss, Cesare Fiorio, later claimed that Toivonen was the only driver who could really control the Delta S4.<ref name="VM"/>

In a Henri Toivonen obituary, titled ''Rebel With a Cause'', published in [[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]] five days after Toivonen's fatal accident, rally author Martin Holmes named him a "rebel driver", and proof that young drivers can be successful in rallying, a sport which had previously been dominated by older, more experienced drivers.<ref name="Motor"/> However, Toivonen could not achieve the necessary level of consistency to avoid a number of high speed accidents. Prior to the introduction of the Delta S4, he was known for his ability to make up large amounts of time in single stages.<ref name="Historic Racing"/> This led to a number of stage wins but also to several bad accidents resulting from driving mistakes. Toivonen's career almost ended in early 1985, when he was nearly paralysed due to an accident at the Costa Smeralda Rally. 1985 would have been his first full WRC season. Toivonen never did get to drive a full season and the closest one to it was 1981, when he competed in seven out of the 12 rounds. The World Rally Archive's [[Hall of Fame]] now names him an "icon for the one of the most controversial periods of rallying."<ref>{{cite web | title=Hall of Fame - So close | work=World Rally Archive | url=http://www.juwra.com/hof_so_close.html | accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

[[Image:Race of Champions.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[2005 Race of Champions]] at the [[Stade de France]].]]
Toivonen was buried in [[Espoo]], where his family moved from [[Jyv<U+00E4>skyl<U+00E4>]] when Toivonen was still very young. In [[Corsica]], a marble slab dedicated to him and Sergio Cresto was placed at the curve where Toivonen drove out. The memorial place always has an unopened bottle of [[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]], which is a reference to Toivonen's Martini-sponsored teams; [[Martini Racing]] and Lancia Martini. A local resident puts new flowers by the slab every day.<ref>{{cite web | author=Williams, Jerry | title=From the Service Park: Corsica | work=[[World Rally Championship|WRC]] | url=http://www.wrc.com/page/ServicePark/0,,10111~815664,00.html | accessdate=2006-11-15}}</ref> In 1988, former rally driver and arguably the most successful female race car driver in history,<ref>{{cite web | author=Russell, Richard | title=History of Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system | work=CanadianDriver | url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/rr/quattro.htm | accessdate=2006-11-17}}</ref> [[Mich<U+00E8>le Mouton]] organised the first [[Race of Champions]] to commemorate the death of Henri Toivonen.
