It was formed in 2001, just before the [[Sri Lankan legislative election, 2001|2001 elections]], and consists of the

*[[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]]
*[[Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front]] (A faction known as Suresh wing)

==Party manifesto and policies==
The party has come up with two party manifestos since 2001. In general the policies are based on the what is known as the [[Thimpu principles]] amongst Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists. They are 

# Recognition of the Tamils of [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Sri Lanka as a distinct nationality]].
# Recognition of an identified [[Tamil Eelam|Tamil homeland]] and guarantee of its territorial integrity.
# Based on the above, recognition of the inalienable right of [[self-determination]] of the Tamil nation.
# Recognition of the right to full citizenship and other fundamental democratic rights of all Tamils who look upon the island as their country.'

Further the party stands for 

# The immediate lifting of the economic embargo currently in force in parts of the northeast province
# The withdrawal of the residential and travel restrictions foisted on the Tamil nationality
# The immediate cessation of the war being currently waged in the northeast
# The immediate commencement of the process of negotiations with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE) with international third party involvement.<ref name=TNA/>

===Relationship to the LTTE===
The alliance recognizes the LTTE as the sole Tamil national entity that has the right to negotiate on behalf of the Tamil people with the government of Sri Lanka. The alliance fully supports the [[Interim Self Governing Authority]] (ISGA) proposal made the LTTE. The alliance in general facilitates the eventual peace talks between the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE directly over the Tamil national problem.<ref name=TNA/>
