'''Azoxy''' compounds are a group of [[chemical compound]]s sharing a common [[functional group]] with the general structure RN=N<sup>+</sup>(O<sup><U+2013></sup>)R. They are considered [[Amine oxide|N-oxides]] of [[azo compound]]s. Azoxy compounds are [[1,2-dipole]]s.

Azoxy compounds are suspected to be genotoxic.
