'''Lancashire United Transport''' (LUT) was a [[tram]], [[bus]] and [[trolleybus]] operator based at [[Howe Bridge]] in [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Atherton]], 10 miles north west of [[Manchester]]. It had the distinction of being the largest independent bus operator in the [[UK]] until its acquisition by [[Greater Manchester PTE]] in 1976.

==History==
The company was founded in 1905 as '''Lancashire United Tramways Ltd''' to assume operation of the [[South Lancashire Tramways]] [[tram]] system, which had run into financial difficulties.<ref>[[#Reference-idOgden2006|Ogden 2006]], p.13</ref> The tram system was centred on the towns of [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]] and [[Atherton, Greater Manchester|Atherton]] in South Lancashire, with lines running towards [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Wigan]], [[Bolton]] and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].

Trams continued to run under the "''South Lancashire Tramways''" fleetname, but after the [[First World War]] LUT took the opportunity to operate motorbus services using the "''Lancashire United''" fleetname. By 1926, the bus fleet had reached the total of 100 operating over 21 routes.<ref name="idOgden2006-23">[[#Reference-idOgden2006|Ogden 2006]], p.34</ref> The company changed its name in the same year to '''Lancashire United Transport and Power Company Ltd''' to reflect the widened range of business activities.<ref name="idOgden2006-23" />

The company continued to operated routes in South Lancashire until purchased by [[Greater Manchester PTE]] in 1976. LUT remained as an independent subsidiary until 1981 when the company was officially wound up and its assets transferred to Greater Manchester Transport.
