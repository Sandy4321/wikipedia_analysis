'''Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Canada|CC]] [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|CMM]] [[Order of Merit of the Police Forces|COM]] [[Canadian Forces Decoration|CD]] [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada|FRCPSC(''hon'')]]}} ({{IPA-fr|mika.<U+025B>l <U+0292><U+0251><U+0303>}}; born September 6, 1957) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] journalist and stateswoman who served as [[Governor General of Canada]], the [[List of Governors General of Canada#Governors General of Canada, 1867-present|27th]] since [[Canadian Confederation]].

Jean was a [[refugee]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/3e1eaa6d4.html |title=Jean, Micha<U+00EB>lle |publisher=The UN Refugee Agency |accessdate=2010-06-11 }}</ref> from [[Haiti]]{{mdash}} coming to Canada in 1968{{mdash}} and was raised in the town of [[Thetford Mines]], [[Quebec]]. After receiving a number of university degrees, Jean worked as a journalist and broadcaster for [[Radio-Canada]] and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC), as well as undertaking charity work, mostly in the field of assisting victims of [[domestic violence]]. In 2005, she was appointed governor general by [[Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], on the recommendation of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]], to replace [[Adrienne Clarkson]] as [[Viceroy|vicereine]], and she occupied the post until succeeded by [[David Johnston]] in 2010. Early in her tenure, comments of hers recorded in some of the film works by her husband, [[Jean-Daniel Lafond]], were construed as supporting [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]] and her holding of [[dual citizenship]] caused doubt about her loyalties. But Jean denied separatist leanings, renounced her citizenship of [[France]], and eventually became a respected vicereine. Jean was formally appointed and installed as [[Diplomatic rank#Special envoys|Special Envoy for Haiti]] for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] on November 8, 2010, for a four-year term.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/haiti_not_forgotten_michaelle_jean_taking_up_her_duties_as_unesco_special_envoy_for_haiti_on_8_november/| title=Haiti not forgotten: Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean taking up her duties as UNESCO Special Envoy for Haiti on 8 November| publisher=UNESCO| accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thespec.com/news/world/article/274046--former-governor-general-michaelle-jean-to-begin-united-nations-work-for-haiti| title=Former governor general Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean to begin United Nations work for Haiti| publisher=The Canadian Press| accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref>

Unlike all other former governors general who hadn't already been made privy councillors, Jean was not sworn into the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] following the end of her viceregal service, denying her the accordant style of ''[[The Honourable]]''; however, as a former Governor General of Canada, Jean is entitled to be styled for life with the superior form of ''[[The Right Honourable]]''.

==Early life and education==
Jean's family hails from [[Haiti]]; she was born in [[Port-au-Prince]], baptised at the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Port-au-Prince|Holy Trinity Cathedral]],<ref name=GGJean>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=41| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=Role and Responsibilities > The Governor General and Her Spouse > Governor General Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=January 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name=Panetta>{{Cite news| last=Panetta| first=Alexander| title=Governor General Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean in quake-ravaged Haiti: 'You are not alone'| publisher=Yahoo News| date=March 8, 2010| url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/100308/national/gg_haiti| accessdate=March 11, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and spent winters in that city and summers and weekends in [[Jacmel]], her mother's hometown.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Wyatt| first=Nelson| title=Canadian troops will focus aid on town with deep ties to GG Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean| newspaper=Canada East| date=January 18, 2010| url=http://www.canadaeast.com/front/article/924618| accessdate=January 20, 2010}}</ref> Though her father was the principal of and a teacher at an elite Protestant private school in Port-au-Prince, Jean was educated at home, as her parents did not want her swearing allegiance to the then Haitian president, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Duvalier]], as all Haitian schoolchildren were required to do.<ref name=CE>{{Cite book| last=Azzi| first=Stephen| contribution=The Canadian Encyclopedia| title=Biography > Governors General of Canada >  Jean, Micha<U+00EB>lle| editor-last=Marsh| editor-first=James Harley| place=Toronto| publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada| url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0009825| accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref>

With her family, Jean fled Haiti to escape Duvalier's regime, under which Jean's father was in 1965 arrested and  tortured.<ref name=CE /> Jean's father left for Canada in 1967 and Jean, her mother, and sister, arrived the following year;<ref name=CE /> the family settled together at [[Thetford Mines]], [[Quebec]].<ref name=Panetta /><ref name=CBC1>{{cite web| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/governorgeneral/michaelle_jean.html| title=Indepth > Governor General Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean| publisher=CBC| date=October 11, 2005| accessdate=February 22, 2009}}</ref> Jean's father, however, became increasingly distant and violent and her parents' marriage eventually fell apart; she, with her mother and sister, then moved to a [[basement apartment]] in [[Montreal]].<ref name=CE />
[[File:Chiostro Unicatt.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Universit<U+00E0> Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Catholic University of Milan]], where Jean studied languages and literature]]

Jean received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Hispanic languages]] and literature from the [[University of Montreal]], and, from 1984 to 1986, taught Italian studies while completing her [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degree in [[comparative literature]]. She then went on with language and literature studies at the [[University of Florence]], the [[University of Perugia]], and the [[Universit<U+00E0> Cattolica del Sacro Cuore|Catholic University of Milan]]. Besides [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], Jean is fluent in Spanish, Italian, and [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]], and can read [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=CBC1 />

Concurrent with her studies between 1979 and 1987, Jean coordinated a study on spousal abuse and worked at a [[women's shelter]],<ref name=CE /> which paved the way for her establishment of a network of shelters for women and children across Canada. She also involved herself in organisations dedicated to assisting immigrants to Canada obtain the entry they desired, and later worked for [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada|Employment and Immigration Canada]] and at the ''Conseil des Communaut<U+00E9>s culturelles du Qu<U+00E9>bec'', where Jean began writing about the experiences of immigrant women.<ref name=CBC1 /> She married French-born, Canadian filmmaker [[Jean-Daniel Lafond]], and the couple adopted as their daughter Marie-<U+00C9>den, an [[orphan]]ed child from Jacmel.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Taber| first=Jane| title=Governor-General shares grief with B.C.

==Journalism==
Jean became a reporter, filmmaker, and broadcaster for [[Television de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]] in 1988,<ref name=GGJean /><ref name=CBC1 /> hosting news and affairs programmes such as ''Actuel'', ''Montr<U+00E9>al ce soir'', ''Virages'', and ''Le Point''; she was the first person of Caribbean descent to be seen on French television news in Canada.<ref name=CE /> She then moved in 1995 to ''[[R<U+00E9>seau de l'information]]'' (RDI), Radio-Canada's all-news channel, in order to anchor a number of programmes, ''Le Monde ce soir'', ''l'<U+00C9>dition qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>coise'', ''Horizons francophones'', ''Les Grands reportages'', ''Le Journal RDI'', and ''RDI <U+00E0> l'<U+00E9>coute'', for example. Only four years later, however, she was asked by CBC's English language all-news channel, [[CBC Newsworld]], to host ''[[The Passionate Eye]]'' and ''[[Rough Cuts]]'', which both broadcast the best in Canadian and foreign documentary films. By 2004, Jean was hosting her own show, ''Micha<U+00EB>lle'', while continuing to anchor RDI's ''[[Grands reportages]]'', as well as acting occasionally as anchor of ''[[Le T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>journal]]''.<ref name=CBC1 /> 

Over the same period, Jean made several films with her husband, including the award winning ''Ha<U+00EF>ti dans tous nos r<U+00EA>ves'' ("Haiti in All Our Dreams"),<ref name=GGJean /> in which she meets her uncle, the poet and essayist [[Ren<U+00E9> Depestre]], who fled from the Duvalier dictatorship into exile in [[France]] and wrote about his dreams for Haiti, and tells him Haiti awaits his return. She similarly produced and hosted news and documentary programming for television on both the English and French services of the CBC.<ref name=CBC1 />

==Governor generalship==
Jean is Canada's first governor general of Caribbean origin; the third woman (after [[Jeanne Sauv<U+00E9>]] and [[Adrienne Clarkson]]); the fourth youngest (after [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|the Marquess of Lorne]], who was 33 years old in 1878; [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|the Marquess of Lansdowne]], who was 38 years old in 1883; and [[Edward Schreyer]], who was 43 years old in 1979); the fourth former journalist (after Sauv<U+00E9>, [[Rom<U+00E9>o LeBlanc]] and Clarkson); and the second after Clarkson to not only have neither a political nor military background, but also to be a visible minority, to break the tradition of Canadian-born governors general, and to be in an [[interracial marriage]]. Jean is also the first representative of Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to have been born during the latter's reign, and her appointment saw the first child living in [[Rideau Hall]] since Schreyer and his young family lived there in the early 1980s.

===As governor general-designate===
It was on August 4, 2005, announced from the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister of Canada]] that Queen Elizabeth II had, by commission under the [[royal sign-manual]] and [[Great Seal of Canada]], approved [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]]'s choice of Jean to succeed Adrienne Clarkson as the Queen's representative. At the time, Martin said of Jean that she "is a woman of talent and achievement. Her personal story is nothing short of extraordinary. And extraordinary is precisely what we seek in a governor generalship{{mdash}} who after all must represent all of Canada to all Canadians and to the rest of the world as well."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news.asp?id=556| last=Office of the Prime Minister| title=Announcement by Paul Martin of Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean's appointment| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=August 4, 2005| accessdate=August 8, 2005}}</ref> Almost immediately, there was speculation that Martin had been influenced by the political climate in [[Ottawa]] at the time, leading the Prime Minister to deny that rejuvenated popularity for [[Liberal Party of Canada|his party]] in Quebec was a motivating factor in his decision.

From [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]], the upcoming appointment was met with mostly favourable comments,{{#tag:ref|[[Stephen Harper]], then the [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition]] as head of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], offered his congratulations and said that Jean's life story "serves as a great example to many Canadians.

However, by August 11, 2005, reports emerged of a forthcoming piece by Ren<U+00E9> Boulanger for the [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereigntist]] publication ''[[Le Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]]'' that would reveal Jean and her husband's support for Quebec independence, citing Lafond's associations with former members of the terrorist organisation, the ''[[Front de lib<U+00E9>ration du Qu<U+00E9>bec]]'' (FLQ),<ref>{{Cite news| last=Peritz| first=Ingrid| title=Rideau Hall pick disappoints separatist hard-liners| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 11, 2005| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050811/LAFOND11/National/Idx| accessdate=August 11, 2005| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050813002909/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050811/LAFOND11/National/Idx| archivedate=August 13, 2005}}</ref> specifically [[Jacques Rose]]. Though Boulanger admitted that he was motivated to incite a rejection of Jean by Anglophone Canadians, Gilles Rh<U+00E9>aume, former president of the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]], called on the Governor General-Designate to reveal how she voted in Quebec's [[Quebec independence referendum, 1995|1995 referendum on independence]],<ref>{{Cite news| last=Wyatt| first=Nelson| title=Separatist says 'Come clean, Jean'| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 11, 2005| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050811.wjean0811| accessdate=August 11, 2005}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=GG-designate challenged on 1995 referendum vote| publisher=CTV| date=August 11, 2005| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1123796154319_119205354/?hub=Canada| accessdate=August 11, 2005}}</ref> and [[Member of Parliament#Canada|Members of Parliament]], as well as some [[Premier (Canada)|provincial premiers]], demanded that Jean and her husband clarify where their sympathies lay.<ref name=CBCPremiers>{{cite news| title=New governor general must clarify sovereignty position, premiers say| publisher=CBC| date=August 12, 2005| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/08/12/jean-sovereignty050812.html| accessdate=August 12, 2005}}</ref> Then, four days after the Prime Minister publicly explained that Jean and her spouse had both undergone thorough [[background check]]s by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]],<ref name=CBCPremiers /><ref>{{Cite news| last=LeBlanc| first=Daniel| title=Martin defends viceregal couple's loyalty| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 13, 2005| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050812.wxlafond13/BNStory/National/| accessdate=February 22, 2009}}</ref> there came to light, on August 17, the existence of a documentary in which Jean had been filmed with several hard-line Quebec separatists, all toasting "to independence" after Jean stated: "Independence can't be given, it must be taken."

It was on that day that Jean responded with a public statement, saying "I wish to tell you unequivocally that both my husband and I are proud to be Canadian and that we have the greatest respect for the institutions of our country. We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... [We] have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement," and went on to say that in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti, and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute,"<ref>{{cite press release| title=Statement by Paul Martin on the Governor General-Designate| publisher=Office of the Prime Minister| date=August 17, 2005| url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news.asp?id=564| accessdate=August 17, 2005}}</ref> though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour.<ref>{{cite news| title=Haitian community holds special church service for the governor general-designate| publisher=CBC| date=August 27, 2005| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/08/27/haitian-church-service-michaelle-jean-080527.html| accessdate=August 27, 2005}}</ref> Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalising on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.<ref name=Wherry>{{Cite journal| last=Wherry| first=Aaron| title=Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean in conversation| journal=Maclean's| issue=October 2010| publisher=Rogers Media| location=Toronto| date=Ocrober 3, 2010| url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/10/03/michaelle-jean-in-conversation/| issn=0024-9262| accessdate=October 21, 2010}}</ref> 

The Queen held [[Audience (meeting)|audience]] with Jean and her family on September 6, 2005, at [[Balmoral Castle]]. Though this type of meeting with a governor general-designate was standard, Jean's was unique in that the presence of her young daughter marked the first time in Elizabeth's reign that her designated viceroy-to-be had brought a child to an audience. Though the meeting went well, upon her return to Canada, Jean yet again became a target when the subject of her [[dual citizenship]] was raised, in particular the [[French nationality law|French variety]] she had obtained through her marriage to the French-born Lafond. A section of the [[Napoleonic code|French civil code]] forbade French citizens from holding government or military positions in other countries,{{#tag:ref|Article 23-8 of the [[Napoleonic code]] allows the French government to ask French citizens to leave the foreign service or lose French nationality in 15 days to two months.|group=n|name=Citizen}} yet Jean, as governor general, would hold a governmental position as the representative of Canada's [[head of state]], and, as such, would have a military role carrying out the duties of [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces|commander-in-chief of the Canadian Forces]], as constitutionally vested in the monarch.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Victoria| author-link=Victoria of the United Kingdom| publication-date=March 29, 1867| title=Constitution Act, 1867| series=III.15| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ca_1867.html| accessdate=February 22, 2009}}</ref> The French embassy in Ottawa stated that there was "no question" that the law would not be enforced in Jean's case, but, on September 25, two days before her swearing-in, Jean made it public that she had renounced her French citizenship "in light of the responsibilities related to the function of Governor General of Canada and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces,"<ref name=CBCForces>{{cite news| title=New governor general to give up French citizenship| publisher=CBC| date=September 25, 2005| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/09/25/jean_citizenship_20050925.html| accessdate=September 25, 2005}}</ref><ref>[[Journal Officiel de la R<U+00E9>publique Fran<U+00E7>aise]], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000447553&dateTexte= D<U+00E9>cret du 23 septembre 2005 portant lib<U+00E9>ration des liens d'all<U+00E9>geance <U+00E0> l'<U+00E9>gard de la France]</ref> thus putting the controversy to rest.

At her investiture ceremony in the [[Senate of Canada|Senate chamber]] on September 27, 2005, Jean declared in a speech described as "moving" that "the time of the [[Two Solitudes (Canadian society)|Two Solitudes]] that for too long described the character of this country is past," and called for the protection of the environment, the shielding of culture against [[globalization]], and an end to the marginalisation of young people. According to one media account, "the pomp and circumstance of Canada's most significant state function were blended with humour, passion and even tears."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Thompson| first=Elizabeth| title=Passion and Tears: Jean Sworn In| newspaper=The Gazette| date=September 28, 2005| url=http://www.canada.com/national/features/governor_general/story.html?id=78549c49-781f-43c0-908d-20f24db2ca5a| accessdate=September 28, 2005}}</ref> while ''The Globe and Mail'' columnist [[John Ibbitson]] reflected the general captivation with the new governor general in the following way:
{{Cquote2|[H]ere is this beautiful young Canadian of Haitian birth, with a smile that makes you catch your breath, with a bemused older husband by her side, and a daughter who literally personifies our future, and you look at them and you think: Yes, this is our great achievement, this is the Canada that Canada wants to be, this is the Canada that will ultimately make way for different cultural identities.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Ibbitson| first=John| author-link=John Ibbitson| title=The remarkable new Governor-General| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=September 28, 2005| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050928.wxibbitson28/BNStory/International/}}</ref>}}

Echoing her inaugural speech, the motto on the personal [[coat of arms]] created for Jean upon taking office as governor general was ''BRISER LES SOLITUDES'', which translates into "breaking down solitudes". One of her first acts as vicereine was then to launch an [[online]] chat with Canadians, as part of the larger project of creating within the Governor General's [[domain name]] a [[website]] dubbed "Citizen Voices: Breaking Down Solitudes", where users could engage each other in discussion forums and prominent individuals could post blog entries. The focus extended beyond simply the relationship between the traditional Two Solitudes of [[Francophone]]s and [[English Canadian|Anglophones]] in Canada to include relations between peoples of all racial, linguistic, cultural, and gender groups.

Over the first two years of her mandate, Jean embarked on the traditional viceregal tours of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada's provinces and territories]]. In [[British Columbia]], Jean presented the [[Grey Cup]] at the [[93rd Grey Cup|93rd Canadian Football League championship game]]; in [[Iqaluit]], [[Nunavut]], she opened the Toonik Tyme Festival, where she donated eighty books in [[Inuktitut]], French, and English to the Centennial Library in commemoration of Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday;<ref>{{cite journal| first=Micha<U+00EB>lle| last=Jean| title=Her Excellency the Right Honourable Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean Speech on the Occasion of the Opening Ceremony of the Toonik Tyme Festival| publisher=Government House| date=April 17, 2006| url=http://archive.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4728| accessdate=April 17, 2006}}</ref> and, on May 4, 2006, she became the first governor general to address the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. During these tours, Jean also focused strongly on the plight of female victims of violence, meeting with representatives of women's organisations, such as when, in 2007, she participated in a historic private discussion with aboriginal women chiefs and elders at [[Government House (Saskatchewan)|Saskatchewan's Government House]].<ref>{{cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=GG encourages dialogue to end domestic violence| publisher=CTV| date=May 16, 2007| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070516/jean_violence_070516/20070516?hub=Canada| accessdate=May 16, 2007}}</ref> In contrast to her low approval ratings prior to her appointment, crowds were large and welcoming wherever Jean went.<ref>{{cite news| title=Hundreds greet new Governor General| publisher=CBC| date=October 18, 2005| url=http://www.cbc.ca/manitoba/story/mb_gg20051018.html| accessdate=October 18, 2005}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Only as her convoy arrived at the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] for her first [[Remembrance Day#Canada|Remembrance Day]] ceremony, on November 11, 2005, were Jean and Lafond greeted with disapproval from an audience, when veterans turned their backs on the Governor General and her consort to show contempt for two people the veterans felt had worked to break up the country they had fought to defend.<ref>{{cite news| title=Canadians honour war dead in solemn ceremony| publisher=CTV| date=November 11, 2005| url=http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051111/Remembrance_Day_051111| accessdate=November 11, 2005}}</ref>

====Military duties and welcomes overseas====
The viceregal family undertook their first international trip in February 2006, journeying to [[Italy]] to attend the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremonies of the 2006 Winter Olympics]], meet [[President of the Italian Republic|Italian President]] [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] in Torino, and [[Pope Benedict XVI]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Three months later, Jean attended the investiture of [[Ren<U+00E9> Pr<U+00E9>val]] as [[List of Presidents of Haiti|President of Haiti]], Jean's first visit to her homeland in her capacity as the Queen's representative, and where she was greeted with enthusiasm in Jacmel.<ref>{{cite news| title=Governor General visits her family's hometown in Haiti| publisher=CBC| date=May 16, 2006| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2006/05/16/jean05162006.html| accessdate=May 18, 2006}}</ref> At the end of the year, between November 18 and December 11, 2006, Jean then embarked on a trip consisting of state visits to five African countries{{mdash}} [[Algeria]], [[Mali]], [[Ghana]], [[South Africa]], and [[Morocco]]{{mdash}} wherein the Governor General encouraged women's rights.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Panetta| first=Alexander| title=Jean welcomed by 'brothers and sisters'| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=November 22, 2006| url=http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&call_pageid=971358637177&c=Article&cid=1164235812148| accessdate=November 30, 2006}}</ref> She also, in a precedent-breaking move, personally explained on her Citizen Voices website the role of the governor general in undertaking such trips and the reason behind these particular tours throughout Africa,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.citizenvoices.gg.ca/en/blogs/michaelle_jean/25| last=Jean| first=Micha<U+00EB>lle| title=BLOGG > Canada and Africa| date=November 19, 2006| accessdate=November 30, 2006}}</ref> after which she continued to post her observations and feelings on her experiences on the continent. In Mali, where she arrived on November 23, 2006, Jean was greeted by tens of thousands of people lining the highway as her motorcade passed and, in the town of Benieli, she was presented with a [[goat]], replete with a [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] on its collar.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=Malis gives GG thanks, and a goat| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=November 27, 2006| url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/123644--malis-gives-gg-thanks-and-a-goat|accessdate=August 21, 2010}}</ref> Male vendors also gave Canadian journalists gifts to be passed on to Jean, provided that she also be given their telephone numbers.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Panetta| first=Alexander| title=Press in Mali gives GG thanks, and a Goat| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=November 25, 2006| url=http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&call_pageid=971358637177&c=Article&cid=1164409811440| accessdate=November 30, 2007}}</ref> Further, during the South African leg of the tour, then [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]] praised the [[Queen-in-Council]]'s decision to appoint Jean as governor general, citing it as an example to [[Europe]]an countries of how African immigrants could be treated.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Associated Press| author-link=Associated Press| title=South Africa's president praises Canada's first black governor general for setting an example for immigrants| newspaper=Herald Tribune| date=December 5, 2006| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/05/africa/AF_GEN_South_Africa_Canada.php| accessdate=March 25, 2009}}</ref>

Jean embraced her role as acting commander-in-chief, one of her first international duties being a trip, from 29<U+2013>30 October 2005, to [[France]] for the 90th anniversary of the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], just after which she returned to Canada for the arrival at [[Trenton, Ontario]], of the bodies of six Canadian soldiers killed in [[Afghanistan]]. Jean made on March 8, 2007, her first visit to [[Canadian Forces|Canadian troops]] taking part in the [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|offensive in Afghanistan]]; she had earlier expressed her desire to go, but Harper advised against such a trip on the grounds of security concerns, the relevance of which were demonstrated when two attacks were made against Canadian soldiers on the same day the Governor General landed in Kabul.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=GG visits Canadian troops| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=March 8, 2007| url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/189686| accessdate=March 15, 2007}}</ref> Jean had the arrival timed specifically for [[International Women's Day]], stating: "the women of Afghanistan may face the most unbearable conditions, but they never stop fighting for survival. Of course, we, the rest of the women around the world, took too long to hear the cries of our Afghan sisters, but I am here to tell them that they are no longer alone. And neither are the people of Afghanistan." Part of the Governor General's itinery included meeting with Afghan women, Canadian soldiers, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] teams, humanitarian workers, and diplomats.<ref>{{cite press release| title=Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada undertakes first visit to Afghanistan| publisher=Office of the Governor General of Canada| date=March 8, 2007| url=http://archive.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=4994| accessdate=March 15, 2007}}</ref>

====A "loose cannon" and a parliamentary dispute====
Still, there was by early 2007 some perception that Jean's schedule was seemingly thinner than that of her predecessors; an initial explanation of fatigue was further detailed by the [[Secretary to the Governor General of Canada|Secretary to the Governor General]] as [[thyroid]] problems, and that the vicereine's doctor had advised rest after Jean's previously hectic diary.<ref name=Thyroid>{{cite news| title=Thyroid problem forced Governor General to miss work: office| publisher=CBC| date=April 26, 2007| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/04/26/jean-govgeneral.html?ref=rss| accessdate=April 26, 2007}}</ref> At the same time, some in the Ottawa Press Gallery opined that Jean had on a few occasions in the previous year overstepped the boundaries of an office that was expected to remain non-partisan; journalist [[Chantal H<U+00E9>bert]] said that the Governor General had "been wading uncommonly deep in political territory over the past few months," citing the Jean's criticism of Quebec sovereigntists and her expressed support for [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|the mission of Canadian troops]] in [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{Cite news| last=H<U+00E9>bert| first=Chantal| author-link=Chantal H<U+00E9>bert| title=Will Jean thwart election call?; | newspaper=Toronto Star| date=September 27, 2006| url=http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1159307412136&call_pageid=968256290204&col=968350116795| accessdate=September 28, 2006}}</ref> Further, [[Michael Valpy]] penned a piece in ''The Globe and Mail'' critiquing Jean for inviting who Valpy described as "potentially politically charged individuals" to post on her Citizen Voices website.<ref name=Valpy>{{Cite news| last=Valpy| first=Michael| author-link=Michael Valpy| title='Your biggest problem is Rideau Hall,' top bureaucrat warned Harper| newspaper=Globe and Mail| date=April 24, 2007| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070424.JEAN24/TPStory/National}}</ref> Jean had also made, at the [[Roast (comedy)|roast]]-like annual National Press Gallery dinner, satirical remarks about [[Parti Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] leadership candidate [[Andr<U+00E9> Boisclair]]'s admitted [[cocaine]] use and,<ref>{{cite news| title=Governor General criticized by sister over Boisclair jokes| publisher=CBC| date=November 6, 2005| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/11/05/jean-051105.html| accessdate=November 6, 2005}}</ref> in a September 18, 2006, interview regarding a proposed subsidy for Canadians to travel domestically, she commented that Quebecers "are sometimes very disconnected from the rest of Canada" and that their isolation affected Canada's unity. Jean later clarified her opinion by adding that Canadians from all provinces were disconnected from other parts of the country<ref>{{cite news| title=Le Qu<U+00E9>bec boude le Canada, d<U+00E9>plore Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean| language=French| publisher=LCN| date=September 2006| url=http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/national/archives/2006/09/20060923-170419.html| accessdate=September 27, 2006| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060929133808/http://lcn.canoe.com/lcn/infos/national/archives/2006/09/20060923-170419.html| archivedate=September 29, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=Governor-General defends remarks on Quebec| newspaper=Globe and Mail| date=September 25, 2006| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060925.NATSTOR25/TPStory/National| accessdate=September 27, 2006}}</ref> and a September 26 editorial in the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' supported Jean's statements on the divisions between Canada's peoples, saying that supporting national unity was a part of a governor general's mandate,<ref>{{Cite news| last=Editorial| title=Exchanges bring two solitudes closer| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=September 27, 2006| url=http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1159307412210&call_pageid=968256290204&col=968350116795| accessdate=September 27, 2006}}</ref> but the ire of Quebec separatist politicians was not assauged. Further, the content of a speech by Jean to mark the 25th anniversary of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] was regarded as thinly veiled criticism of her [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]]'s decision to end the [[Court Challenges Program of Canada|Court Challenges Program]] and,<ref>{{Cite news| last=Editorial| title=Her Charter gaffe| newspaper=Globe and Mail| date=April 19, 2007| accessdate=April 20, 2007}}</ref> into 2007, it was reported that Jean's staff at [[Rideau Hall]] had been systematically removing royal portraits from the walls of the palace. All of this prompted Valpy to reveal that, early in his time as prime minister, [[Stephen Harper]] was told by [[Alex Himelfarb]], then the [[Clerk of the Privy Council]]: "Prime Minister, your biggest problem is in Rideau Hall," meaning Jean and her potential to be a "[[loose cannon]]".<ref name=Valpy />

Jean carried out the regular ceremonial duties of state, such as dedicating the new [[Royal Ontario Museum#Third expansion|Michael Lee-Chin Crystal]] at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] on June 1, 2007 (following in the footsteps of her predecessor, [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], the then governor general who opened the first expansion of the museum in 1914),<ref>{{Cite news| last=Canadian Press| title=Inside the ROM crystal| newspaper=Toronto Star| date=June 1, 2007| url=http://www.thestar.com/article/220522| accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref> and undertaking a state visit to [[Brazil]], from July 6<U+2013>15, 2007.<ref>{{Cite press release| title=Governor General to visit Salvador, Brasilia, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as part of State Visit to Brazil| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=June 27, 2007| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=12516| accessdate=November 2, 2009}}</ref> By late 2008, however, the Governor General had to return to Canada in the midst of a state visit in Europe to contend with [[2008<U+2013>2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute|a parliamentary dispute]] that endangered the stability of government, as a [[Coalition government|coalition]] of three opposition parties in [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] threatened to rescind their [[Confidence (politics)|confidence]] in the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]] under the chairmanship of Stephen Harper. Choosing to follow constitutional precedent, Jean accepted, after two hours of deliberation, her prime minister's advice to [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue]] parliament until late January 2009.<ref>{{cite news| title=GG agrees to suspend Parliament: Harper | publisher=CBC| date=December 4, 2008| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html| accessdate=December 4, 2008}}</ref> It was at the end of Jean's viceregal tenure disclosed by [[Peter H. Russell]], one of the constitutional experts from whom Jean sought advice, that the Governor General granted the prorogation on two conditions: parliament would reconvene soon and, when it did, the Cabinet would produce a passable budget. This, Russell said, set a precedent that would prevent future prime ministers from advising the prorogation of parliament "for any length of time for any reason."<ref>{{Cite news| last=Elliott| first=Louise| title=PM gave Jean pledges in prorogation crisis | publisher=CBC| date=October 2, 2010| url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/10/01/harper-jean-prorogation.html| accessdate=November 13, 2010}}</ref> Jean thus prevented the possibility of an official vote of non-confidence and a resulting situation wherein she would be required to choose between asking the coalition to form a government or dissolving parliament and [[dropping the writ]]s after having allowed an election only four months earlier.<ref>{{cite news| title=The race is on: Harper calls election for Oct. 14 | publisher=CTV| date=September 7, 2008| url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080907/election_call_080907?s_name=&no_ads=| accessdate=February 26, 2009}}</ref> Along with the subsequent prorogation of parliament in December 2009 and the earlier calling of [[Canadian federal election, 2008|an election]] in October 2008, Jean was for almost two years part of a controversy in the Canadian media that focused on the constitutional relationship between the governor general and the prime minister or the leaders of the parties in opposition.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Smith| first=David E.| title=The Crown and the Constitution: Sustaining Democracy?| periodical=The Crown in Canada: Present Realities and Future Options| page=5| publication-place=Kingston| publisher=Queen's University| date=June 10, 2010 | url=http://www.queensu.ca/iigr/conf/ConferenceOnTheCrown/CrownConferencePapers/The_Crown_and_the_Constitutio1.pdf| accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref>

During a tour of [[Nunavut]] in early 2009, the Governor General again garnered headlines when she there participated in a traditional [[Inuit]] seal feast at a community festival, gutting a seal that had been [[Seal hunting|recently killed by hunters]] and consuming a piece of the raw heart.

On May 10, 2010, [[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands]] presented Jean with a new [[tulip]] [[cultivar]] named the ''Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean tulip''; with deep maroon petals, it was designed to reflect the Governor General's personal tastes.<ref name=tulip1>{{Cite video| people=Hempstead, Doug| title=Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean Tulip unveiled| medium=Adobe Flash| publisher=Canoe| location=Ottawa| date=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name=tulip2>{{Cite news| last=Hempstead| first=Doug| title=Dutch princess visits Rideau Hall| newspaper=Ottawa Sun| date=May 12, 2010| url=http://www.ottawasun.com/news/ottawa/2010/05/12/13923666.html| accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13629| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| authorlink=Governor General of Canada| title=Her Royal Highness Princess Margriet of the Netherlands at Rideau Hall| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> This carried on the tradition of [[Canadian Tulip Festival#History|Dutch royals gifting tulips to Canada]].

Summaries of Jean's time as the Queen's representative emerged by mid-2010; Jean was regarded as having fulfilled the role in an admirable, though not perfect, fashion.

The two Simbis are water spirits in [[Culture of Haiti|Haitian culture]], who, by legend, calm rough seas and give wisdom; they stand in before a rocky terrain upon which are rooted a palm tree{{mdash}} a Haitian symbol of peace{{mdash}} and a pine tree{{mdash}} representative of the natural riches of Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&ProjectID=929&ProjectElementID=3456| last=Canadian Heraldic Authority| title=The Public Register of Arms, Flags, and Badges of Canada > Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=September 20, 2005| accessdate=September 23, 2008}}</ref>
