'''StanFlex''' (also known as '''STANFLEX''' or '''Standard Flex''') is a [[Modular design|modular]] mission payload system used by the ''Kongelige Danske Marine'' ([[Royal Danish Navy]], KDM).

Originally conceived during the 1980s as a way of replacing several [[ship class|classes]] of minor war vessel with a single class of multi-role ships, the StanFlex system consists of weapons and equipment mounted in standardised containers, which can be loaded into slots on the ships. These containers can be swapped out in a short period of time, allowing the ship to switch between roles when needed.

The success of the modular payload system led the KDM to design all new warships with StanFlex slots, and to install slots on older vessels during major refits. By 2012, nine ship classes capable of carrying StanFlex payloads will be in service.

==Development==
During the early 1980s, the KDM required replacements for three [[ship class|classes]] of minor war vessel, but could not afford to replace all 22 ships on a one-for-one basis.<ref name=ScottVersatility>Scott, ''Versatility the key to Denmark's evolving navy''</ref> Instead of building dedicated replacements for each role, the KDM came up with the idea for a single vessel design which could be modified to assume a particular role when needed.<ref name=ScottVersatility/> Equipment common to all roles would be built into the ship, while mission specific payloads would be built into modules, which could be fitted into standardised slots aboard the ship when needed.<ref name=ScottVersatility/> This modular payload system came to be known as "Standard Flex", or "StanFlex" for short.<ref name=ScottVersatility/>

Feasibility studies during 1983 and 1984 led to the design of the Standard Flex 300 vessel (later named the [[Flyvefisken class patrol vessel|''Flyvefisken'' class]]); 16 of which could replace the 22 previous vessels.<ref name=ScottVersatility/> These were {{convert|54|m|ft|adj=on}} long, 320-ton [[patrol vessel]]s, fitted with one Standard Flex slot forward and three aft.<ref name=ScottVersatility/> The modules themselves were designed by the Naval Materiel Command and Promecon A/S.<ref name=LokCSS/> Construction commenced in July 1985, with 14 vessels (2 having been cancelled in 1993) commissioned by mid-1996.<ref name=ScottVersatility/>

As other warship types were replaced, the new vessels were designed to carry StanFlex modules.<ref name=ScottVersatility/>

==Module design and use==
Stanflex modules are constructed by [[Monberg & Thorsen]].<ref name=ScottFlexing>Scott, ''Flexing a snap-to-fit fleet''</ref> Each module is housed in a stainless steel container measuring {{convert|3|m|ft}} in length, {{convert|3.5|m|ft}} in width, and {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} in height.<ref name=ScottFlexing/> Precision-machined flanges ensure that the module accurately mates up with connections for power, ventilation, communications, water, and data.<ref name=ScottFlexing/> The weapon or system is mounted on the roof of the module, while the machinery, electronics, and supporting equipment are housed within.<ref name=ScottFlexing/>

Modules are usually installed and replaced by a 15-ton capacity [[mobile crane]].<ref name=ScottFlexing/> A module can be swapped out and replaced within half an hour, and after system testing completed, the ship is ready to deploy within a few hours.<ref name=ScottFlexing/> However, refresher training for the ship's crew will take significantly longer.<ref name=ScottFlexing/> Standardised consoles are fitted in the [[combat information centre]]: the console's role is defined by the software installed, which can be quickly replaced.<ref name=ScottFlexing/><ref>Naval Studies Board, ''Technology for the United States Navy and Marine Corps, 2000-2035'', p. 30</ref> The ease of installation and use is compared by naval personnel to another Danish product: [[Lego]].<ref name=ScottFlexing/>

===Benefits and drawbacks===
* Unused modules can be stored in controlled conditions, reducing the need for preventative mainenance.<ref name=ScottVersatility/>

* Ships do not need to be taken out of service when equipment requires maintenance, and vice versa.<ref name=ScottVersatility/>

* New weapons and systems can be installed on the vessels by fitting them to a module, instead of refitting the entire ship.<ref name=ScottVersatility/>

* When a ship or class is removed from service, the modules can be reused by other vessels.<ref name=LokCSS/> Similarly, as they do not have to be built into the ship, modular weapons and systems do not have to be factored into the purchase cost of a new vessel: in 2006, a proposed 6,000-ton frigate design for the KDM was predicted to cost [[Danish krone|DKK]] 1.6 billion per ship, while similar projects in other European nations were slated to cost between DKK 2.6 billion and DKK 6.3 billion.<ref name=LokCSS/>

* The multi-role ships are slightly less efficient than a dedicated ship in a particular role, but the ability to be quickly reequipped for other roles more than makes up for this.<ref name=ScottFlexing/>

===Inventory===
As of 2001, the KDM inventory of StanFlex modules included:<ref name=ScottFlexing/>

By 2012, nine ship classes will be capable of using StanFlex modules.<ref name=LokCSS/>
