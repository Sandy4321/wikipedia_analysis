</ref> City Hall has gone through several renovations, with the most recent overhaul gutting the interior to upgrade it to modern seismic and safety standards. The original was built for $600,000, while the 1996 to 1998 renovation cost $29 million.

Located in [[downtown Portland]], City Hall sits on an entire city block along Fourth and Fifth avenues at Madison and Jefferson Streets. To the south is the [[Wells Fargo Center (Portland, Oregon)|Wells Fargo Center]], and to the north is the [[Portland Public Service Building|Portland Building]]. [[Terry Schrunk Plaza]] (named for a [[Terry Schrunk|former mayor]]) is across Fourth Avenue to the east. In addition to more than {{convert|87000|sqft|m2}} of interior space, the exterior consists of landscaped grounds. The main entrance is located on Fourth Avenue, though for a time it was located on the Fifth Avenue side.

==History==
===Late 19th century===
In 1869, the [[Oregon Episcopal School]] was founded in downtown Portland at the current site of City Hall,<ref>Franzen, Robin. Keeping the tradition. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[September 7]] [[1994]].</ref> followed by St. Helens Hall.<ref name=century/> In 1889, the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] approved a sale of $100,000 worth of bonds by the City of Portland to finance the construction of a new city hall.<ref name=construction>Bella, Rick. Portland<U+2019>s City Hall. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[November 21]] [[1993]].</ref> The city hired Henry Hefty to design the building; Hefty's design was considered similar to the [[Kremlin]].<ref name=construction/> Portland purchased the plot of land in 1891 for $100,000,<ref name=century/> and construction began in 1892, but was halted after a short time.<ref name=timeline>City Hall timeline. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[November 21]] [[1993]].</ref> After the foundation and basement of the building had been built, the city had already exceeded its $100,000 budget. The state took over the project and created a board composed of city businessman to finish the project.<ref name=construction/>

This board terminated Hefty and hired the architectural firm of [[Whidden & Lewis]] to design a new building.<ref name=construction/> Ion Lewis and William Whidden were originally from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]].<ref name=construction/> The board also persuaded the state legislature to authorize an additional $500,000 in bonds to complete the project.<ref name=construction/> Whidden & Lewis designed a four-story structure in a neo-Renaissance style that included a [[clock tower]].<ref name=construction/> Designed to be located in the center portion of the building, the tower was to rise five-stories above the rest of City Hall with a total height of 200 feet.<ref name=frozen/> Due to costs, the clock tower was never built.<ref name=construction/> A domed [[cupola]] also designed by Whidden & Lewis was never built.<ref name=king/> The original building design was praised for the details and symmetry.<ref name=construction/>

In 1893, construction at the site was re-started.<ref name=timeline/> City Hall was built with un-reinforced masonry walls and slurry concrete floors to save on costs.<ref name=renovation/> Construction on the new structure was finished in 1895 and the city government occupied the building.<ref name=timeline/> Once completed, the building was one of the first large buildings in the [[Pacific Northwest]] to have electric wiring, have [[centralized heating]], include public elevators, or be considered fire proof.<ref name=heritage>Norman, James B., and James B. Norman. ''Portland's Architectural Heritage: National Register Properties of the Portland Metropolitan Area''. Portland, Or: Oregon Historical Society Press, 1991. p. 77.</ref> [[William S. Mason]] was the first Portland mayor in the new City Hall, with a total of 34 people working in the building at opening.<ref name=construction/><ref name=king/> His successor, [[Sylvester Pennoyer]], called the new building "expensive, unseemly and unhealthful."<ref name=timeline/>

When built, the surrounding area was composed of dirt roads and private residences.<ref>Portland City Hall. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[April 6]] [[1994]].</ref> The [[Southern Pacific Railway]]'s 1868 west side rail line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the [[Multnomah County Courthouse|county courthouse]].<ref name=rail>Terry, John.

''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[August 26]] [[2007]].</ref> The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s.<ref name=rail/> In 2007, light rail lines were added on Fifth Avenue for the [[MAX Green Line]], with trains scheduled to once again run past City Hall.<ref>Rasmussen, Randy L. Putting down tracks. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[April 21]] [[2007]].</ref>

===20th century===
In 1902, two [[Port Orford cedar]] trees were planted on the east side of City Hall.<ref name=timeline/> One tree was planted on the north side and the second tree on the south side of the building to reinforce the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health.<ref>Christ, Janet. City Hall cedar gets reprieve, more care. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[April 5]] [[1999]].</ref> In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.<ref name=timeline/>

Until 1902 the [[Portland Public Library (Oregon)|Portland Public Library]], which started as a reading room for sailors and then as a subscription library, was housed in the building.<ref>Scheppke, Jim. "The origins of the Oregon State Library; Research Files". ''Oregon Historical Quarterly'', March 22, 2006, Pg. 130 Vol. 107 No. 1. ISSN: 0030-4727.</ref> In 1928, the city began one of a series of renovations on the building to increase floor space.<ref name=timeline/> That year one of the two light wells were filled in, blocking off natural light to the lower floors. The city added a new elevator in 1931.<ref name=timeline/> The next remodel started in 1933, and lasted through 1937.<ref name=timeline/> During this construction the second light well was filled in for more space, and a [[penthouse apartment]] was built on top of the roof.<ref name=timeline/>

[[Image:City Hall - Portland Oregon.png|thumb|City Hall circa 1922]]
In 1910, the city installed a large boulder on the southeast portion of the grounds.<ref name=boulder>[http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/regs/fedreg/notices/96_25145.pdf Federal Register: Vol. 61, No. 192.

In the 1960s the mayor's office was refurbished, a new roof was installed, and new trees were planted on the grounds.<ref name=timeline/> In 1964, the city remodeled the City Council chambers on the second and third floors.<ref name=timeline/> Part of the work was to install new lighting to allow television broadcasts<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/index.cfm?c=28258 City Council video feed and information].

In the early morning hours of [[November 21]] [[1970]], a dynamite fueled bomb exploded underneath the portico, doing $170,000 in damage.<ref name=timeline/><ref name=grace>Bella, Rick. A hall of fading grace. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[November 21]] [[1993]].</ref> Though no one was injured, windows were blown out, the Council Chamber (located above the blast) was damaged, all of the columns of the portico were damaged and replaced, and the Liberty Bell replica was a complete loss.<ref name=grace/> A new bell was purchased for $8,000 and later moved to [[Terry Schrunk Plaza]].<ref name=grace/> No one was ever arrested or claimed responsibility for the bombing.<ref name=grace/>

Later in the decade, Portland upgraded City Hall by adding fire sprinklers and smoke detectors.<ref name=timeline/> In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone.<ref name=timeline/> It was later learned that this process was harmful as the silicon coating sealed the moisture inside the rock.<ref name=revival>Gragg, Randy. City Hall revival. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[July 28]] [[1994]].</ref> In 1974, City Hall was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=grace/> The following year the rooftop penthouse was converted into an employee break room that included an outdoor deck.<ref name=timeline/> In 1978, the city constructed a wheelchair ramp to provide access to the handicapped.<ref name=timeline/>

The 1980s saw additional renovations. The auditor's office and the mayor<U+2019>s office were both renovated, though work on the mayor's office halted when funds were exhausted.<ref name=timeline/> The city expanded the office of the city's attorney, and in 1982 the [[Portland Building]] was finished across the street.<ref name=timeline/> This allowed the city to move many city offices into a single location.<ref name=timeline/> Work was also completed on the exterior, while a new roof was finished.<ref name=timeline/> In 1985, the building began a conversion from steam heating.<ref name=timeline/>

In January 1995, the City Council voted to remove parking from the grounds of City Hall.<ref name=parking>Portland City Hall will get its 100th birthday party. ''[[The Oregonian]]'', [[January 2]] [[1995]].</ref> Previously, the landscaped yard surrounding the building had been paved to allow the city council members to park their vehicles on site.<ref name=parking/> That month also marked the 100th birthday of the structure.

===Renovation===

Financing of the renovations came from [[Municipal bond|local bonds]], with approximately $3 million per year coming from the general fund to pay the debt off.<ref name=costoverruns/> Prior attempts at raising private funds for the project had failed.<ref name=costoverruns/> The project was named as the top public project and was an honorable mention in the renovation category for 1998 by ''Northwest Construction magazine''.<ref name=award/>
