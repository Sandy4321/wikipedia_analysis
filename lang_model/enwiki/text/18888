'For five days, nothing.

The ''Newsweek'' article, part of which was subsequently retracted, stated that allegations that [[United States|U.S.]] personnel at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] had deliberately damaged a copy of the book by flushing it in a toilet in order to torment the prison's [[Muslim]] captives had been confirmed by government sources. 

The ''Newsweek'' article stated that an official had seen a preliminary copy of an unreleased U.S. government report confirming the deliberate damage. Later on, the magazine retracted this when the (still) unnamed official changed his story.  A [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] investigation uncovered at least five cases of Qur'an mishandling by U.S. personnel at the base, but insisted that none of these were acts of desecration. The Pentagon's report also accused a prisoner of damaging a copy of the [[Qur'an]] by putting it in a toilet. In 2007, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], suing under the [[Freedom of Information Act]], secured the release of a 2002 FBI report containing a detainee's accusation of ill-treatment, including throwing a Qur'an into a toilet.<ref name=ACLU>

This specific accusation had been made on several occasions by other Guantanamo detainees since 2002; ''Newsweek'''s initial account of a government report confirming it sparked protests throughout the [[Islamic world]] and riots in [[Afghanistan]], where pre-planned demonstrations turned deadly. A worldwide controversy followed.

The ''Newsweek'' affair turned the spotlight on earlier media reports of such incidents. Accusations of Qur'an desecration as a part of U.S. interrogations at prisons in Afghanistan and [[Iraq]] as well as Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay had been made by a number of sources going back to 2002.

==History==
There were over a dozen pre-''Newsweek'' reports in the mainstream media alleging U.S. Qur'an abuse, including the following:

* Several times in 2002 and in early 2003, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] reported complaints by detainees at Guantanamo Bay prison of desecration of the Qur'an by U.S. guards in Guantanamo.<ref name=AlJazeera20050521>

* The [[BBC]] reported on December 30, 2004 that the former Guant<U+00E1>namo prisoner [[Abdallah Tabarak]] maintained that "American soldiers used to tear up copies of the Qur'an  and throw them in the toilet."
* In a book review dated January 16, 2005, the ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' reported that five [[United Kingdom|British]] detainees, after their release, claimed that they "had seen other prisoners sexually humiliated, had been hooded, and were forced to watch copies of the Koran being flushed down toilets." 
* ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' reported on January 20, 2005 that there were complaints concerning guards who had "defaced their copies of the Koran and, in one case, had thrown it in a toilet."
* ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' reported on March 6, 2005 that three Guant<U+00E1>namo captives &mdash; Fawzi al Odah, 27, Fouad al Rabiah, 45, and Khalid al Mutairi, 29 &mdash; "separately complained to their lawyer that military police threw their Qur'an  into the toilet."
* ''The Miami Herald'' also reported on March 9, 2005 that Guant<U+00E1>namo Base staff insulted [[Allah]] and "threw Qur'ans  into toilets."

== The ''Newsweek'' report ==
On April 30, 2005 ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine published an article claiming that an unnamed [[United States]] official had seen a government report supporting a "previously unreported" charge. Among the previously unreported cases, sources tell NEWSWEEK: interrogators, in an attempt to rattle suspects, flushed a Qur'an down a toilet and led a detainee around with a collar and dog leash. [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7693014/site/newsweek/] of Qur'an (Koran) desecration at [[Camp X-Ray]], a U.S. military detention facility in Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay.[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7693014/site/newsweek/] The prospect that U.S. personnel may have deliberately defaced the Qur'an provoked massive anti-U.S. demonstrations throughout the Islamic world, with at least 17 deaths during riots in [[Afghanistan]].

The ''Newsweek'' article, by reporter [[Michael Isikoff]], was one of over a dozen such reports of similar incidents that had surfaced in prior months in the U.S. and [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] media, but the first involving a U.S. government source acknowledging an inquiry into the event. The Isikoff article was later retracted by ''Newsweek,'' which nonetheless defended both its reporter and the story, stating "neither we nor the Pentagon had any idea it would lead to deadly riots." The case turned the spotlight on other reports of desecration of the Qur'an at Guant<U+00E1>namo.

The article went largely unnoticed for five days. On May 6, a popular member of the [[Pakistan]]i [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliament]], [[Imran Khan]], held a press conference. Khan, who is a sharp critic of both Islamist terrorism and of Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]], criticized his country's government, saying, "This war on terrorism is self-defeating if, on the one hand, you [Musharraf] are demanding that we help them and on the other hand, they are desecrating the book on which our entire faith is based." Khan's press conference was rebroadcast throughout the Muslim world.

The ''Newsweek'' report cited an anonymous source, said to be a senior government official, who claimed to have seen a confidential investigative report documenting the alleged incident &mdash; in which interrogators, "in an attempt to rattle suspects, reportedly flushed a Qur'an down a toilet." However, on May 16, ''Newsweek'' retracted the statement that the abuse had been uncovered by an "internal military investigation."  after the source of the story was later unable to confirm where he had seen the information. In its May 23 issue, ''Newsweek'' stated that:

: ''Our original source later said he couldn't be certain about reading of the alleged Qur'an incident in the report we cited, and said it might have been in other investigative documents or drafts. Top administration officials have promised to continue looking into the charges, and so will we. But we regret that we got any part of our story wrong, and extend our sympathies to victims of the violence and to the U.S. soldiers caught in its midst.''

''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted Isikoff as saying:

: ''Neither ''Newsweek'' nor the Pentagon foresaw that a reference to the desecration of the Qur'an  was going to create the kind of response that it did. The Pentagon saw the item before it ran, and then they didn't move us off it for 11 days afterward. They were as caught off guard by the furor as we were. We obviously blame ourselves for not understanding the potential ramifications.''

==International reaction ==

On May 10 and continuing the following week, many violent anti-American protests took place, and in some areas these turned into deadly riots. In [[Afghanistan]], demonstrations that began in the eastern provinces and spread to [[Kabul]] were reported to have caused at least seventeen deaths. The [[United Nations]], as a precautionary measure, withdrew all its foreign staff from [[Jalalabad]], where two of its guest houses were attacked, government buildings and shops were targeted, and the offices of two international aid groups were destroyed. Demonstrations also took place in [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]], [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], Pakistan and [[Indonesia]], leading to the death of at least 15 people.<ref name=Bbc29959512>

White House press secretary [[Scott McClellan]] said, "The report had real consequences, people have lost their lives. Our image abroad has been damaged." However, in a press release issued by the [[United States Department of State]] on May 12, General [[Richard B. Myers]] claimed that the ''Newsweek'' story was not a chief cause of the riots: "He has been told that the Jalalabad, Afghanistan, rioting was related more to the ongoing political reconciliation process in Afghanistan than anything else." <ref name=StateDeptDenials>

On May 27, thousands of demonstrators gathered in what ''[[The New York Times]] ''referred to as "waves of protest" in Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and the Middle East, "mostly centered on Friday prayer gatherings." The ''Times'' reported that U.S. flags were burned at some demonstrations, and that, although most of the protests were peaceful, overt calls for an "Islamic revolution" were loudly supported by the crowds in Pakistan, further complicating a difficult political situation for General Musharraf.

A [[Red Cross]] spokesperson Simon Schorno confirmed that U.S. personnel at [[Camp X-ray]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} had displayed "disrespect" to the Qur'an, and that U.S. officials knew of this activity. Delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross informed U.S. authorities, who took action to stop the alleged abuse, said Schorno. He declined to specify the nature of the incidents.

:"We're basically referring in general terms to disrespect of the Qur'an, and that's where we leave it", Schorno told The Associated Press. "We believe that since, U.S. authorities have taken the corrective measures that we required in our interventions."<ref name=LATimes20050522>

==US military findings==
On June 3, 2005, a U.S. military investigation by the base commander, Brigadier General Jay Hood, reported four (possibly five) incidents of "mishandling" of the Qur'an by U.S. personnel at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay. Hood said his investigation "revealed a consistent, documented policy of respectful handling of the Qur'an dating back almost two and a half years."<ref name=VoaNews20050603a>

[[CBC News]] reported:
:"The U.S. Pentagon confirmed Friday a list of abuses involving the Qur'an, Islam's holy book, by American personnel at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, but said the incidents were relatively minor."<ref name=Cbc20050604>

According to the Hood report:
*a soldier intentionally kicked a Qur'an; 
*an interrogator intentionally stepped on a Qur'an; 
*a guard's urine came through an air vent, unintentionally splashing a detainee and his Qur'an; 
*water balloons thrown by prison guards at one another unintentionally caused a number of Qur'ans to get wet; and 
*a two-word obscenity was written in English on the inside cover of a Qur'an (whether US personnel were responsible for this act, however, could not be confirmed). 
The report laid out the circumstances of these incidents and disciplinary actions taken.  It also stressed that such mishandling was rare, and that guards were usually respectful of the Qur'an, following strict regulations the military laid down for handling the Qur'an.<ref name=VoaNews20050603b>

The Hood report also listed 15 reported incidents of detainees mishandling their own copies of the Qur'an, including complaints made by other detainees.
One of these cases involved a prisoner "attempting to flush a Qur'an down the toilet and urinating on the Qur'an." 

The statement did not provide any explanation about why the detainees might have abused their own holy books.<ref name=Cbc20050604/>

==FBI documents and other reports==
The ''Newsweek'' article and the ensuing controversy turned the spotlight on other reports of Qu'ran desecration and spurred additional investigations by others. After a verdict by a federal court on May 25, 2005, the [[ACLU|American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) obtained documents from the [[FBI]] interrogations of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp#Detention of prisoners|Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] detainees dating back to August 2002. The documents stated that some detainees had claimed to have witnessed Qur'an desecration (including "flush[ing] a Qur'an in the toilet"), among other acts, on many occasions by their guards &mdash; in a document dated August 1, 2002. The pertinent excerpt reads as follows:

''"[P]rior to his capture, [name redacted] had no information against the United States. Personally, he has nothing against the United States. The guards in the detention facility do not treat him well. Their behavior is bad. About five months ago, the guards beat the detainees. They flushed a Koran in the toilet. The guards dance around when the detainees are trying to pray. The guards still do these things."''<ref name=AcluFbiSecret>

The ruling of the court forcing the release of this and other documents came under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N25430006.htm]

The ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, in a news release, that "The United States government continues to [[turn a blind eye]] to mounting evidence of widespread abuse of detainees held in its custody." 

The FBI declared that it could not investigate the matter, as it was up to the Defense Department to do so. For its part, the Pentagon, through its spokesman Lawrence Di Rita, appeared to have transitioned from flat denials to vagueness and unsettled syntax: "There have been instances, and we'll have more to say about it as we learn more, but where a Qur'an may have fallen to the floor in the course of searching a cell." Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, told reporters that  "past accusations have had credibility issues."

James Jaffer, an attorney working for the ACLU, was quoted by the ''New York Times'' as stating that errors in the ''Newsweek'' story had been used to discredit other investigative efforts conducted by his organization and other groups "that were not based on anonymous sources, but [on] government documents, reports written by FBI agents."

Many questioned the veracity of such accounts, noting that the FBI, in 2004, had released a [http://web.archive.org/web/20050331091340/http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/trainingmanual.htm captured Al-Qaeda training manual] which [[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[United States President|Presidency]] spokesmen claim shows that Al-Qaeda members are trained to make false accusations once captured. 
<!-- 
Actually, the manual tells readers to seek a medical examination prior to capture, to provide a "before" picture.  Arguably, this is the exact opposite of what they should do if they were going to lie about torture.  This document was written prior to 9-11, when if potential readers of the manual were captured they would be captured by countries known to make routine use of torture.

IMO Bush Presidency spin-doctors are deliberately misinterpreting this document, trusting that readers won't bother to download it and read it for themselves.

IMO the manual is not instructing it readers to lie about torture.  Rather the manual assumes its readers will face torture.
-->

==The SERE connection==

Several reports have alleged a connection between events at Guantanamo Bay and a [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]]-funded program known as [[SERE]], which stands for "Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape."

On May 16, 2005, [[Juan Cole]] published an email from a former SERE attendee who reported abuse of the Christian holy book in training.<ref name=JuanCole>

}}</ref>
The emailer had no direct knowledge of operations at Guantanamo, but noted that this tactic sounded similar to that alleged in the Newsweek story.

In July 2005, an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine suggested that the SERE program involved a number of techniques which paralleled those allegedly used at Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay, including the desecration of religious texts. The writer contacted Juan Cole's anonymous source who said that in 1999 he attended a Navy SERE program in California.[http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/articles/050711on_onlineonly01]

:So the [[Bible]] trashing happened when this guy had us all in the courtyard sitting for one of his speeches. They were tempting us with a big pot of soup that was boiling - we were all starving from a few days of chow deprivation. He brought out the Bible and started going off on it verbally - how it was worthless, we were forsaken by God, etc. Then he threw it on the ground and kicked it around. It was definitely the climax of his speech. Then he kicked over the soup pot and threw us back in the cells.

The SERE program's chief psychologist, Col. Morgan Banks, issued guidance in early 2003 for "behavioral science consultants" who helped to devise Guant<U+00E1>namo's interrogation strategy<U+2014>although Banks has emphatically denied that he advocated the use of SERE counter-resistance techniques to break down detainees.  However, General [[James T. Hill]], chief of the U.S. Southern Command, confirmed that a team from Guantanamo went "up to our SERE school and developed a list of techniques" for "high-profile, high-value" detainees.  According to an [[editorial|op-ed]] in the November 14, 2005 ''[[New York Times]]'' by M. Gregg Bloche and Jonathan H. Marks, two lawyers with no first-hand knowledge of SERE, "General Hill had sent this list -- which included prolonged isolation and sleep deprivation, stress positions, physical assault and the exploitation of detainees' phobias -- to Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who approved most of the tactics in December 2002.  Some within the Pentagon warned that these tactics constituted torture, but a top adviser to Secretary Rumsfeld justified them by pointing to their use in SERE training, a senior Pentagon official told us last month."<ref name=Nytimes20051114>
