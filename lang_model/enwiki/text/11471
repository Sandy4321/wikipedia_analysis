'''Tropical Storm Kiko''' was a strong [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical storm|tropical storm]] that capsized a boat off the western coast of Mexico, killing at least 15&nbsp;people. The 15th and final [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2007 Pacific hurricane season]], Kiko developed out of a [[tropical wave]] that formed off the coast of Africa on September 26 and traversed the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The wave crossed over [[Central America]] and entered the Pacific Ocean on October&nbsp;8, where it spawned Tropical Depression 15-E on October&nbsp;15. The depression drifted to the south over the next day before briefly being declared Tropical Storm Kiko. It subsequently weakened into a tropical depression, but later reattained tropical storm intensity. By October&nbsp;18, Kiko was forecast to make [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] along the western Mexican coastline as a moderate tropical storm. However, the cyclone turned to the west and reached its peak intensity of 70&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]] (110&nbsp;[[Kilometers per hour|km/h]]) on October&nbsp;20. The tropical storm slowly weakened to a [[Low pressure area|remnant low-pressure area]] by October&nbsp;24 and completely dissipated on October&nbsp;27 without making landfall.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Kiko 2007 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] exited the western coast of Africa on September&nbsp;26, quickly spawning an [[Low pressure area|area of low pressure]]. Upon the formation of the low, the wave split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern low quickly developed, spawning [[Tropical Storm Melissa (2007)|Tropical Depression Fourteen]] on September&nbsp;28. The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying [[tropical cyclone|tropical depression]]. It continued through the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing [[Central America]], on October&nbsp;8. A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275&nbsp;miles (440&nbsp;kilometres) south of [[Acapulco|Acapulco, Mexico]]. However, the low remained disorganized because of strong [[wind shear|upper-level winds]]. On October&nbsp;13, the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Michelle Mainelli|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Tropical Cyclone Report|date=2007-11-18|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2008-07-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-EP152007_Kiko.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The low developed enough [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] late on October&nbsp;14 to be declared ''Tropical Depression Fifteen-E'' while located about 435&nbsp;mi (705&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Colima, Colima|Colima, Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhome|title=Tropical Depression 15-E Discussion Number 1|date=2007-10-14|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref>

The depression was embedded within a broad, low-level cyclone with weak steering currents that caused Fifteen-E to drift southward for the next 30&nbsp;hours.<ref name="tcr"/> On October&nbsp;16, strong easterly [[wind shear]] exposed the center of the depression from shower and thunderstorm activity. However, a [[Rainband|curving convective band]] developed around the system, and satellites detected winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h). This prompted the [[National Hurricane Center]] to upgrade the depression to ''Tropical Storm Kiko'' as it drifted about 430&nbsp;mi (695&nbsp;km) southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Lixion Avila|Avila]]|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number 7|date=2007-10-16|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.007.shtml?}}</ref> The intensification was short-lived, and Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression six hours later when the center separated from diminishing convection.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Lixion Avila|Avila]]|title=Tropical Depression Kiko Discussion Number 8|date=2007-10-16|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.008.shtml?}}</ref> On October&nbsp;17, the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm when the low became associated with deep convection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pasch|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number 10|date=2007-10-17|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-09-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.010.shtml?}}</ref> The center remained poorly defined, and winds of tropical storm-force blew only in Kiko's southwest quadrant. Over the next few days, Kiko moved slowly towards the east-northeast as a minimal tropical storm and was forecast to either brush land or to make landfall along the Mexican coast on October&nbsp;19 or October&nbsp;20.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pasch|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number 14|date=2007-10-18|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.014.shtml?}}</ref> However, early on October&nbsp;19, Kiko turned to the northwest when a high-pressure [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] developed over Mexico.<ref name="tcr"/> Forecasters predicted that the storm would become a strong [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 1 hurricane]] as it turned away from Mexico and headed to sea.<ref>{{cite web|author=Blake/[[Lixion Avila|Avila]]|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number 17|date=2007-10-18|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.017.shtml?}}</ref>

As the ridge pushed the storm away from the coast, weaker wind shear and warm sea-surface temperatures allowed Kiko to gradually intensify. The storm reached its peak intensity of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) 991&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|mbar]] ([[Pascal (unit)|hPa]]; 29.28&nbsp;[[inch of mercury|inHg]]) late on October 20 while located around 175&nbsp;mi (280&nbsp;km) west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. As it moved away from the coast, an [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] began to form.<ref name="tcr"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Beven|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number 24|date=2007-10-20|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-07-27|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.024.shtml?}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, shear increased and began to separate the low from the deep convection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rhome|title=Tropical Storm Kiko Discussion Number 27|date=2007-10-21|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-22|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2007/ep15/ep152007.discus.027.shtml?}}</ref> By the afternoon of October&nbsp;21, the storm was poorly organized and the center was partially exposed.

==Naming and lack of retirement==
When Tropical Depression Fifteen-E was upgraded to Tropical Storm Kiko on October&nbsp;16, it was the fourth time that the name was used for a tropical cyclone in the [[Pacific hurricane|eastern Pacific basin]]. The name ''Kiko'' was submitted by the World Meteorological Organization's Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee<ref name="Committee name">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|date=2008-05-13|accessdate=2009-02-08|title=Dean, Felix, and Noel Retired From List of Storm Names|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2008/20080513_stormnames.html}}</ref> in 1979 after the list of names was changed to include male names.<ref name="naminglist">{{cite web|author=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|title=Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Names|date=2007-09-23|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-11|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml}}</ref>  The name was previously used for a tropical cyclone in 1983, 1989, and in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|title=Eastern Pacific Best Tracks, 1949-2007|year=2008|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-11-02|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2007_epa.txt}}</ref> Despite the fatalities associated with the capsized ship&mdash;the [[World Meteorological Organization]] retires names that caused significant loss of life which would make future use of the name inappropriate due to sensitivity issues<ref name="naminglist"/>&mdash;the name ''Kiko'' was not retired and is included on the list of names for the [[List of tropical cyclone names|2013 Pacific hurricane season]].<ref name="naminglist"/>
