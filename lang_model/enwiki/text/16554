''The Absolutely True Diary'' is a [[first-person narrative]] by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[adolescence|teenager]] Arnold Spirit Jr., also known as "Junior", a 14-year-old budding [[cartoonist]].<ref name="Publishers Weekly" /> The book is a [[bildungsroman]], detailing Arnold's life on the [[Spokane Indian Reservation]] and his decision, upon encouragement from a reservation high school teacher, to go to an all-white public high school in the off-reservation town of [[Reardan, Washington]].<ref name="School Library Journal">{{cite journal|title=Grades 9-12 Curriculum Connections|journal=School Library Journal|year=2008|volume=54|issue=61|page=61|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref> The novel has 65 [[comic]] illustrations by Forney, which sometimes act as punchlines while also revealing Arnold's character and furthering the plot.<ref name="Absolutely Fabulous">{{cite journal|last=Attenberg|first=Jami|title=Absolutely Fabulous|journal=Print|year=2007|volume=61|issue=5|pages=16|url=PRINTMAG.com|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>  

The novel is controversial for some of its content on issues such as alcohol, poverty, bullying, references to [[masturbation]] and physical arousal, as well as for the tragic deaths of characters and the use of [[profanity]]. As a result, some schools have [[Book censorship in the United States|banned]] the book from [[School library|school libraries]] or inclusion in curricula.<ref name="Kirkus Reviews">{{cite journal|last=McNamee|first=Gregory|title=Absolutely True Tales of Censorship|journal=Kirkus Reviews|year=2011|volume=79|issue=17|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>

==Plot==
The novel opens with Arnold's explanations of the fact that he was born with an excess of [[cerebrospinal fluid]] in his skull (an event that he describes as being "born with [[water in the brain]]"). The brain damage that resulted from this and the surgery that he underwent to remove the excess fluid left Arnold with many physical problems. Some of these problems are that he has forty-two teeth (which are pulled out to make him have the right amount), is skinny, and has an over-sized head, hands, and feet. He also suffers from poor eyesight, experiences frequent [[seizure]]s, [[stuttering|stutters]], and has a [[lisp]]. Mistreated by others on the reservation because of these problems, Arnold is regularly beaten up and given such nicknames as "retard" (for the brain damage that he has sustained) and "globe" (for his large head). His family, like the majority of the other reservation families, is incredibly poor: This point is emphasized when Arnold's adopted dog Oscar begins to suffer from intense heat exhaustion and Arnold's father is forced to shoot him to avoid having to pay the expensive veterinary treatment necessary to save him. 

Arnold's life on the reservation is brightened by his friend Rowdy, described by Arnold as being "the toughest kid on the rez". Rowdy's father abuses him and his mother, thus they are constantly and noticeably covered in bruises. Despite the hardships that he experiences and his cold, tough attitude, Rowdy stays true to his friend Arnold and tries to protect him from some of the physical abuse he is dealt. On Arnold's first day of high school, his geometry teacher, Mr. P, hands out textbooks to the students and Arnold realizes that his book has his mother's maiden name written in it. She was thirty years old when she gave birth to Arnold, thus making the textbook at least forty years older than Arnold himself. Arnold is angered and saddened by the fact that the Spokane reservation is so poor that it is unable to afford new textbooks for its high school. Because of this, Arnold violently throws the book, which ends up colliding with Mr. P's face and breaking his nose. The school subsequently suspends Arnold. During Arnold's suspension, Mr. P meets with Arnold to reveal to him his sister's dream to be a romance writer, he is not angry with him, and that "You [Arnold] have to leave this reservation".

A week into the school year, Arnold transfers to Reardan High School, a school full of rich white kids in the countryside. Arnold is the only Indian at Reardan besides the team [[mascot]].<ref name="Publishers Weekly" /> Although Arnold's mother is an ex-drunk, his father a drunk, and they are poor, they still allow him to transfer to Reardan. Despite his initial troubles adjusting to the new school, Arnold begins to enjoy Reardan, developing a crush on a white girl, Penelope, and making friends with a student named Gordy. Arnold tries to talk to Rowdy about his crush on Penelope, but their relationship is strained by Arnold's decision to go to Reardan. In contrast, Arnold and Penelope develop a closer relationship and even go to a dance together. Arnold makes the Reardan varsity basketball team and plays two games against his former school, Wellpinit, and specifically Rowdy. Before their first game begins, someone in the crowd hits Arnold with a quarter splitting open his forehead. Arnold gets Eugene to give him stitches in the lockerroom and returns to the game. Wellpinit wins after Rowdy elbows Arnold in the head and knocks him unconscious. In their second meeting, Reardan wins with Arnold guarding Rowdy and holding him to only four points. Arnold believed he wanted to win, but after seeing the Wellpinit players' faces after their defeat, he cried and felt ashamed of himself. Throughout the novel, Arnold is struck by many tragedies<U+2014>his grandmother is run over by a drunk driver, Gerald, while walking home from a [[Pow wow|powwow]], his father's best friend Eugene is shot in the face by his friend Bobby after fighting over the last drink of alcohol, and his newlywed sister and her husband die when their mobile home is accidentally set on fire after a night of heavy drinking. In the end, Arnold and Rowdy reconcile at turtle lake and resolve to correspond no matter where the future takes them, concluding the story.

Arnold was told that Mary never woke up because she was too drunk.

'''Gordy''' <U+2013> attends Reardan, wears glasses, and does everything in the name of science. He is very smart and he eventually becomes Junior's good friend, and<U+2014>in many ways<U+2014>his teacher.

"My grandmother's last act on earth was a call for forgiveness, love, and tolerance."<ref name="Alexie, p.157" group=lower-alpha>Alexie, p. 157.</ref>

== Reception ==

===Reviews===
[[Bruce Barcott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said of the novel in a 2007 review, "For 15 years now, Sherman Alexie has explored the struggle to survive between the grinding plates of the Indian and white worlds. He's done it through various characters and genres, but ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' may be his best work yet. Working in the voice of a 14-year-old forces Alexie to strip everything down to action and emotion, so that reading becomes more like listening to your smart, funny best friend recount his day while waiting after school for a ride home."<ref name=NYT/>

The New York Times opined that this was Alexie's "first foray into the young adult genre, and it took him only one book to master it."<ref name=NYT>{{Cite news | last = Barcott | first = Bruce  |  coauthors = | title = Off The Rez  |newspaper = New York Times  | location = New York City  | pages =   |language =   | publisher = New York Times  Date = November 11, 2007 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/Barcott3-t.html?ex=1352350800&en=e60df68bebea3d68&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink= | accessdate =March 9, 2011 | work=The New York Times | date=November 11, 2007}}</ref> The San Francisco chronicle praised it as "[a] great book full of pain, but luckily, the pain is spiked with joy and humor."<ref>{{Cite news | last= Reyhan | first = Harmanci | coauthors = | title = Sherman Alexie's new novel takes teen off the rez  | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle | location = San Francisco | pages =  | publisher = SFGate | date = September 30, 2007 | url =  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/09/30/RVH4S8Q4V.DTL | accessdate =March 9, 2011}}</ref>

Reviewers also commented on Alexie's treatment of difficult issues. Delia Santos, a publisher for the civilrights.org page, noted "the reality of living utter poverty, contend with the discrimination of those outside of the reservation, cope with a community, and family ravaged and often killed by alcoholism... The character focuses on words and images to depict Native American struggles... He writes to tell the injustice social system."<ref>{{cite web |  last =Santos |  first =Delia  | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian | work = | publisher = | date=October 1, 2010  | url=http://www.civilrights.org/archives/2010/10/1073-indian-diary.html = | doi = | accessdate =March 9, 2011 }}</ref> As Andrew Fersch, a publisher for Vail Daily, commented, <U+201C>most folks block out most of their teenage memory, [while] Alexie embraced it with humor."<ref>{{cite web |  last =Fersch |  first =Andrew  | coauthors = | title=Book Review: The Absolutle True diary of a Part time Indian | work =Vail Daily | publisher = | date=October 20, 2007  | url= http://www.vaildaily.com/article/2007.1020/AE/71020009  | doi = | accessdate =March 9, 2011 }}</ref>

==Controversy==
The book has been at the center of several controversies regarding the depiction of sex and violence in books written for young adults. Alexie responded to such complaints in a 2011 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' post entitled "Why the Best Kids Books Are Written in Blood", in which he argues that attempts to prevent school-aged children from learning about the harsher aspects of contemporary life are "way, way too late". He uses his own life as an example:
<blockquote>Of course, all during my childhood, would-be saviors tried to rescue my fellow tribal members. They wanted to rescue me. But, even then, I could only laugh at their platitudes. In those days, the cultural conservatives thought that KISS and Black Sabbath were going to impede my moral development. They wanted to protect me from sex when I had already been raped. They wanted to protect me from evil though a future serial killer had already abused me. They wanted me to profess my love for God without considering that I was the child and grandchild of men and women who<U+2019>d been sexually and physically abused by generations of clergy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Alexie|first=Sherman|title=Why the Best Kids Books Are Written in Blood|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/06/09/why-the-best-kids-books-are-written-in-blood/|accessdate=July 12, 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 9, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>
Alexie also points out in that post that he has visited many classrooms and received many letters and messages from students who liked the book, noting that these students have had difficult experiences similar to his own<U+2014>"depression, attempted suicide, gang warfare, sexual and physical abuse, absentee parents, poverty, racism, and learning disabilities"<U+2014>and he notes: <blockquote>"I have yet to receive a letter from a child somehow debilitated by the domestic violence, drug abuse, racism, poverty, sexuality, and murder contained in my book. To the contrary, kids as young as ten have sent me autobiographical letters written in crayon, complete with drawings inspired by my book, that are just as dark, terrifying, and redemptive as anything I<U+2019>ve ever read." </blockquote>

===Banned===

'''Stockton, Missouri'''

In April 2010, the Stockton School Board, located in Missouri, voted to remove ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' from the school library after a parent complained about its content.<ref>[http://www.stltoday.com/news/state-and-regional/missouri/article_3faa21e8-17bd-5743-8104-24b587cd4405.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}</ref> The American Library Association has asked the school board to reconsider its decision. In September 2010 the School Board decided to uphold its April decision to ban the book from the curriculum and from the library with a vote of 5<U+2013>2.<ref>Cedar County Republican, September 15, 2010.

'''Richland, Washington'''

In June 2011, the Richland School Board, in Washington, voted to prohibit the use of ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' for all grade levels. The book was subject to a pilot program, by a ninth-grade English class, prior to an Instructional Materials Committee review. Although the original vote was only about the appropriateness of the novel for freshman English students, the Committee decided to remove it from all grades, by a vote of 3<U+2013>2.<ref>Tri-City Herald, June 19, 2011.

'''Newcastle, Wyoming'''
 
In Mid-October 2010, Newcastle Middle School attempted to use the book in the 8th grade English curriculum. At first, the district allowed it under the premise that children who weren't allowed to read it would bring a signed paper allowing them to read the alternate book ''Tangerine''. About two weeks after the announcement made to the 8th graders, the school board banned it on terms of teaching it in a curriculum, but still allowed it in the library for those who wished to read it.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://weston.wy.schoolwebpages.com/education/page/download.php?fileinfo=MTAtMjctMTBfQm9hcmRfTWludXRlcy5wZGY6Ojovd3d3Ny9zY2hvb2xzL3d5L3dlc3Rvbi9pbWFnZXMvZG9jbWdyLzM2ZmlsZTQ0Ni5wZGY= | title=Weston County School District #1 | publisher=Schoolwebpages.com | accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>

== Autobiographical elements ==
''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' is semi-autobiographical.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316013692 School Library Journal]</ref>  The novel started as a section of Sherman Alexie's family [[memoir]], but after the persistance of a Young Adult editor he decided to use it as a basis for his first Young Adult novel.<ref name="Song of Myself">{{cite journal|last=Margolis|first=Rick|title=Song of Myself|journal=School Library Journal|year=2007|volume=53|issue=8|pages=29|url=http://www.slj.com|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref>  Sherman Alexie states that, "If I were to guess at the percentage, it would be about seventy-eight percent true".<ref name="Fiction And Poetry Award" />  Like Arnold, Sherman Alexie did grow up on the Spokane Reservation in Wellpinit<ref name="Bio">{{cite news |work= [[The New York Times]] |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/books/review/Barcott3-t.html |date= November 11, 2007 |first= Bruce |last= Barcott |title= Off the Rez |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref> with an alcoholic father.<ref name="About Sherman Alexie" /> He was also born with [[hydrocephalus]], like Arnold,<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/books/11435616.html StarTribune Books]</ref> but Alexie did not have any speech impediments and did not have seizures.

The only difference from Alexie's life and the novel is that Alexie threw the book against the wall and did not hit anyone.<ref name="Fiction And Poetry Award" />
