'''Hurricane Love''' was the final official [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Forming in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on October 18, the storm initially drifted westward, but soon curved eastward into the central gulf. The storm eventually peaked with winds corresponding to [[Category 1 hurricane|Category 1]] status on the modern-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Despite threatening the western coast of [[Florida]] and prompting various preparations, the storm deteroirated due to dry air and moved ashore harmlessly north of [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]].

Throughout the hurricane's track, dry air infringed on the western side of the circulation. On October 20, the storm began curving northeastward towards the coast of western Florida.
