"'''On a Night Like This'''" is a song by Australian singer [[Kylie Minogue]], taken from her seventh studio album ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]''. It was released on 11 September 2000 as the second single from the album. The album version is slightly shorter than the music video version. The song was written by Steve Torch, [[Graham Stack (record producer)|Graham Stack]], [[Mark Taylor (producer)|Mark Taylor]] and Brian Rawling and produced by Stack and Taylor. Musically, "On a Night Like This" is a [[dance-pop]] song, with elements of [[nu-disco]] and [[house music|house]] while the lyrics are about a girl who wants to share her night with a boy on a specific night together. 

The song received positive reviews from music critics, who felt it was a highlight from the album and potentially single-worthy. The accompanying music video was a concept based on the 1995 crime film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''. The song charted at one and two on the [[Australian Singles Chart]] and [[UK Singles Chart]] and fared moderately worldwide.

The song was later re-recorded in 2011 at the [[Abbey Road Studios]] for inclusion on Minogue's orchestral album ''[[The Abbey Road Sessions (Kylie Minogue album)|The Abbey Road Sessions]]''.

==Background==
Originally, the recording was first recorded by Swedish recording artist and radio hot [[Pandora (singer)|Pandora]].

For the re-released version, the song is composed as an [[orchestra]]l song. According to Kitty Empire from ''[[The Guardian]]'', the song "transforms the teenage-crush fervour of the original into a cool, big-band seduction."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/25/kylie-the-abbey-road-session-review Kylie: The Abbey Road Sessions <U+2013> review (Parlophone)].

==Reception==

===Critical response===
"On A Night Like This" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Mark Edwards from [[Stylus Magazine]] said that it, along with her duet with [[Robbie Williams]] on [[Kids (Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue song)|Kids]], "cemented her comeback, and then came the aforementioned mega-song."<ref>[http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/kylie-minogue/ultimate-kylie.htm Ultimate Kylie | Stylus Magazine Review]</ref> Jason Shawahn from [[About.com]] gave it a positive review, saying that it, along with "[[Please Stay (song)|Please Stay]]" and "[[Spinning Around]]", are "a blessing for domestic music consumers".<ref>[http://dancemusic.about.com/od/reviews/fr/KylieUltimate.htm Kylie Minogue - Ultimate Kylie] www.about.com</ref> Scott Kara from ''New Zealand Herald'' described the original "a swirling, late night club pop tune."<ref name="nz"/> Matt James from ''Popmatters'' described the song as "bedroom-eyed" and "nightclubber", while stating it's still hot enough to melt large glaciers.<ref>http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/161246-kylie-minogue-the-best-of/</ref>

The version from the ''Abbey Road Sessions'' was positive as well. Robert Corpsey from [[Digital Spy]] highlighted the song as an album standout, enjoying that the lyric content stood out.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/albumreviews/a433692/kylie-minogue-the-abbey-road-sessions-album-review.html</ref> Philip Matusavage from [[MusicOMH]] found it a "confident" highlight and "transforming the fairly-anonymous Europop of the original into a swaggering big band number which no contestant on [The X Factor] could pull off."<ref>http://www.musicomh.com/albums/kylie-minogue-6_1012.htm</ref>

Although [[Allmusic]] highlighted it as an album track, it gave it a mixed review, giving it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Nick Levine from [[Digital Spy]] said that the song is a "catchy dance-pop song". One [[NME]] reviewer compared it to [[Spiller]]'s song [[Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)|Groovejet]], writing that the song "works because it doesn't revolve awkwardly round a random disco beat".<ref>[http://www.nme.com/reviews/kylie-minogue/2942 NME]</ref> Another NME reviewer described the song as lacking passion and "unremarkable".<ref name="nme.com">[http://www.nme.com/reviews/kylie-minogue/2869 Lacking passion]</ref> [[PopMatters]] gave the album a positive review, but he was disappointed by the record label, and the public, for not releasing the single in the United States, commenting "<U+201C>On a Night Like This<U+201D>, a track that is meant to go right to number one on the Billboard Club Tracks list and while being completely ignored by the general public."<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/minoguekylie-ultimate Ultimate Kylie | PopMatters review]</ref>

===Chart performance===
In Minogue's native Australia the single debuted at number one, and spent two non-consecutive weeks there.

==Music video==
[[Image:On a Night Like This Kylie.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Minogue portrays a  bored [[gun moll|trophy wife]], in a music video which based on [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1995 crime drama movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.]] The [[music video]] for "On a Night Like This" was directed by Douglas Avery, filmed in [[Monte Carlo]], and was loosely based on [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1995 crime drama movie ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', with Kylie herself portraying a character loosely based on [[Sharon Stone]]'s bored [[gun moll|trophy wife]], and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' actor [[Rutger Hauer]] portraying her mob boss partner.<ref name="nme.com"/><ref name="lalala223">Baker and Minogue, Hodder and Stoughton, 2002. p 223.</ref>

The video starts with a mob-related scene, with the men speaking in [[French language|French]]. The video translates with subtitles "''Matters are not handled in this way/Here in Monte Carlo/Things are closely watched/The authorities are extremely vigilant/The things you ask of us/Are not so easy''". As the song starts, Minogue is on a diving board over a pool; she jumps in with while wearing an expensive [[Versace]]. After she sings the chorus, she undresses into her underwear, and looking at the mobsters, throws her dress across towards their window. As the second verse starts, she appears in another Versace costume, with expensive diamond [[jewellery]], in a [[Limousine]]. 

As the chorus arrives, she appears in a Monte Carlo [[casino]], and wins money.  She later goes home, where her mob boss lover sees her, as she comes into the hallway and smashes a green [[Vase|glass vase]]. As the song ends she steps onto a porch, undresses again, and he can only stare. The video ends with her stepping down from the porch, and fades to black. For ''The Abbey Road Sessions'', the song received a music video which was uploaded to her account.

===Video controversy===
While the video enjoyed moderate success in most of the world, it still managed to attract considerable controversy. According to reports by ''[[NME]]'', the original clip supposedly contained scenes that would have resulted in a mass banning. The Directors Cut had been noted to contain Minogue in full-frontal [[nudity]], however, NME reported that plans to release such a music video were scrapped. Despite this, the edited version still turns heads, thanks to a see-through dress sported by Kylie.<ref name="nme.com"/>
