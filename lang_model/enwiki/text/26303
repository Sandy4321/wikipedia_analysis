'''Hurricane Klaus''' was a minimal [[Atlantic hurricane]] that dropped heavy rainfall across the [[Lesser Antilles]] in October of 1990. The eleventh [[tropical cyclone]] and sixth hurricane of the [[1990 Atlantic hurricane season]], Klaus developed from a [[tropical wave]] on [[October 3]] a short distance east of [[Dominica]]. It drifted northwestward, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status on [[October 5]]. Though its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles was within 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km), the strongest winds remained to its northeast due to strong [[wind shear]], which caused Klaus to steadily weaken. After deteriorating into a tropical depression, Klaus briefly restrengthened over the [[Bahamas]] before dissipating on [[October 9]] under the influence of developing [[tropical storm]], [[Tropical Storm Marco (1990)|Marco]].

The hurricane affected many areas that were severely impacted by [[Hurricane Hugo]] in the previous year. Heavy rainfall on [[Saint Lucia]] destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on [[Martinique]], where seven casualties occurred and 1,500&nbsp;people were left homeless. The rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern [[United States]], dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; the same area was impacted with more precipitation a few days later by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the damage caused by the storm, the name Klaus was retired from the [[list of tropical cyclone names]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Klaus 1990 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on [[September 27]]. It tracked westward to the south of a [[subtropical ridge]], becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the [[Cape Verde]] islands on [[September 28]]. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the [[Lesser Antilles]] it organized further, and despite unfavorable upper-level [[wind shear]] the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on [[October 3]] while located about 115&nbsp;miles (185&nbsp;km/h) east of [[Dominica]]. Located in an area of weak [[tropical cyclone#steering winds|steering currents]], the depression drifted to the northwest, and about six hours after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the [[National Hurricane Center]] designated it with the name ''[[Klaus]]''.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1990|title=Hurricane Klaus Preliminary Report|accessdate=2007-10-31|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1990-prelim/klaus/prelim01.gif}}</ref>

Upon becoming a tropical storm, Klaus was located in an area of 29&nbsp;mph (47&nbsp;km/h) of wind shear, although concurrently it was located over warm water temperatures of 83.1<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|F]] (28.4<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Celsius|C]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark DeMaria, Jong-Jin Baik, and John Kaplan|year=1991|title=Upper-Level Eddy Angular Momentum Fluxes and Tropical Cyclone Intensity Changes|publisher=American Meteorological Society|accessdate=2007-11-01|format=PDF|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0469/50/8/pdf/i1520-0469-50-8-1133.pdf}}</ref> Tracking through a highly [[Baroclinity|baroclinic]] environment,<ref name="baro">{{cite web|author=Mukut Mather & Janene Ruess|year=1992|title=Further Evaluation of the Quasi-Lagrangian Model's Forecast Track Guidance|format=PDF|publisher=American Meteorological Society|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/121/5/pdf/i1520-0493-121-5-1514.pdf}}</ref> the storm became better organized, and at 1200&nbsp;UTC on [[October 5]] Klaus attained hurricane status about 30&nbsp;miles (50&nbsp;km) east of [[Antigua]]; shortly thereafter, it passed 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km) east of [[Barbuda]], its closest point of approach to the Lesser Antilles. Klaus reached peak winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 985&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]], though most of its deep convection and strong winds remained to its northeast due to wind shear.<ref name="tcr"/> At the time the hurricane was forecasted to continue tracking to the north-northwest. However, after weakening to a tropical storm on [[October 6]], Klaus turned westward.<ref name="baro"/>

Klaus continued tracking just north of the Lesser Antilles, and after continuing to deteriorate from the wind shear, the cyclone weakened to a tropical depression on [[October 8]] to the north of [[Puerto Rico]]. Later that day, convection redeveloped over the center, and Klaus re-attained tropical storm status as it accelerated toward the northeast [[Bahamas]]; it briefly reached winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> A low pressure area to its west over [[Cuba]] had been steadily intensifying and building toward the surface, and on [[October 9]] it developed into a tropical depression; the cyclone became the dominant system, eventually becoming [[Tropical Storm Marco (1990)|Marco]], and Klaus dissipated under the influence of the system late on [[October 9]]. The remnant moisture continued to the northwest, reaching the coast of [[South Carolina]] by [[October 11]].<ref name="tcr2">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1990|title=Hurricane Klaus Preliminary Report (Page 2)|accessdate=2007-10-31|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1990-prelim/klaus/prelim02.gif}}</ref>

==Preparations==
Early on [[October 4]], shortly after Klaus attained tropical storm status, a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] was issued for the northern [[Leeward Islands]] from [[Saint Martin]] to [[Antigua]], which was upgraded to a hurricane warning as its quick strengthening became apparent; additionally, the government of [[France]] issued a tropical storm warning for [[Guadeloupe]]. A hurricane watch was issued for the [[Virgin Islands]], though it was dropped as Klaus began to weaken.<ref name="tcr5">{{cite web|author=National Hurricane Center|year=1990|title=Hurricane Klaus Preliminary Report (Page 5)|accessdate=2007-11-03|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1990-prelim/klaus/prelim05.gif}}</ref> In Guadeloupe, officials advised citizens to transport livestock to safer areas, and also to avoid potentially flooded areas. Prior to its arrival, schools were closed in [[Martinique]],<ref name="ap104">{{cite news|author=Robert Glass|date=1990-10-04|title=Storm Klaus Bears Down on Caribbean, Hurricane Warnings Issued|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Sint Maarten]], and [[Antigua]]. The [[VC Bird International Airport]] was closed during the passage of the hurricane.<ref name="ap105"/>

Later in its duration, the government of [[The Bahamas]] issued a tropical storm warning for the central and later northern Bahamas, though it was discontinued as the cyclone dissipated.<ref name="tcr5"/>

==Impact==
Hurricane Klaus dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the [[Lesser Antilles]], potentially as high as 15&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;mm); the hurricane affected many areas struck by [[Hurricane Hugo]] in the previous year. On [[Barbados]], flooding from the rainfall blocked a few roads and forced a few families to move to safer areas; lightning from the outskirts of the storm left a portion of the island without power.<ref name="ap104"/> High winds and rainfall affected the island of [[Saint Lucia]], which destroyed about 15% of the nation's banana crop for the year; damage totaled about $1&nbsp;million (1990&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], $1.6&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD).<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Glass|date=1990-10-06|title=Klaus Weakens, Moves Over Open Atlantic Waters|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref>

The rainfall resulted in severe flooding on [[Martinique]], which accrued to almost 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m) in some locations; two sisters drowned near [[Saint-Joseph, Martinique|Saint-Joseph]] after a bridge was washed away.<ref name="ap104"/> Several [[landslide]]s were reported on the island.<ref>{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1990-10-06|title=First Snow in Rockies; Northeast Basks in Summery Weather|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> The passage of the cyclone left damaged and power and telephone systems. 750&nbsp;people evacuated their homes in [[Le Lamentin]] due to flooding,<ref name="ap104"/> and a total of 1,500&nbsp;residents were left homeless on the island.<ref name="ap105">{{cite news|author=Robert Glass|date=1990-10-05|title=Caribbean Islanders Brace for Hurricane Klaus|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Offshore, rough conditions damaged a fishing vessel, leaving its two passengers drifting on the boat for 25&nbsp;days before being rescued about 640&nbsp;miles (1035&nbsp;km) to the north-northwest of Martinique.<ref>{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1990-11-01|title=Two Fishermen Survive Hurricane After Being 25 Days Adrift|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> In all, seven people were killed on the island.<ref name="mwr">{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield & Miles Lawrence|year=1991|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1990|accessdate=2007-11-04|publisher=National Hurricane Center|url=http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0493/119/8/pdf/i1520-0493-119-8-2014.pdf}}</ref>

On [[Dominica]], winds from the hurricane damaged power lines and downed trees in the northern portion of the island.<ref name="ap104"/> High winds on [[Antigua]] damaged a few roofs, and also downed communications from two radio networks.<ref name="ap105"/> The outer rainbands of the storm dropped light rainfall on the [[United States Virgin Islands]], reaching about 1.25&nbsp;inches (32&nbsp;mm) on [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]]; wind gusts peaked at 33&nbsp;mph (53&nbsp;km/h) on [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Gloria Forthun|year=2005|title=Tropical Systems Affecting the U.S. Virgin Islands 1989-1999 as Compared to Hurricane Hugo|publisher=Southeast Regional Climate Center|accessdate=2007-11-04|format=PDF|url=http://radar.meas.ncsu.edu/projects/SERCCreport1.pdf}}</ref> Moderate rainfall continued into the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], with [[Grand Turk Island|Grand Turk]] reporting a total of 4&nbsp;inches (100&nbsp;mm) in 36&nbsp;hours.<ref name="tcr2"/>

On the east coast of [[Florida]], Klaus produced 15&nbsp;foot (4.5&nbsp;m) waves and tides of 3&nbsp;feet (1&nbsp;m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along the east coast, due to persistent westerly winds.<ref>{{cite web|author=Chris Collura|year=2007|title=Chris Colluras Storm Chase Log|accessdate=2007-11-10|url=http://www.sky-chaser.com/stlog.htm}}</ref> As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered the southeastern [[United States]], it produced heavy rainfall between 10 &mdash; 15&nbsp;inches (250 &mdash; 380&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in [[South Carolina]], with slightly lower totals in [[North Carolina]]. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people.<ref name="tcr2"/> About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered the southeastern United States, [[Tropical Storm Marco (1990)|Tropical Storm Marco]] made landfall on northwestern [[Florida]], dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2006|title=Rainfall Summary for Tropical Storm Marco/Hurricane Klaus|publisher=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|accessdate=2007-11-04|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/marcoklaus1990.html}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
{{see also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Due to its impact on [[Martinique]], the government of [[France]] requested the retirement of the name '''Klaus'''; the [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired the name from the [[list of tropical cyclone names]] in the following year and replaced it with the name '''[[Hurricane Kyle|Kyle]]'''. Klaus is one of five Category 1 hurricanes to be retired (the others were [[Hurricane Agnes|Agnes]], [[Hurricane Cesar|Cesar]], [[Hurricane Stan|Stan]], and [[Hurricane Noel|Noel]]), and was the first '''K''' name to be retired since 1954. Additionally, it was one of two hurricanes to be retired without making landfall; the other was [[Hurricane Fabian|Fabian]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=1999|title= The Retirement of Hurricane Names|accessdate=2007-11-04|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/retiram.html}}</ref>
