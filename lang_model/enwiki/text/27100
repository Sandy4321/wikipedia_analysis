The '''Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball''' team represents [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]], [[Ohio]]. The Golden Flashes compete in the [[Mid-American Conference]] East Division and last played in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] in [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]].  Founded in 1913, the team gained national attention during the [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] by advancing to the [[Elite Eight]] as a tenth seed and posted ten consecutive twenty-win seasons, from the 1998-1999 season to the 2007-2008 season.  Kent State has five total appearances in the NCAA Division I basketball tournament along with five Mid-American Conference tournament championships, five MAC overall titles, and eight MAC East division titles.

==History==
Started in 1913, the men's basketball team is Kent State's oldest collegiate team,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dept.kent.edu/ksuprovost_office/ugcat/2004/univorgn04.pdf| title= Kent State University Athletics |accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= PDF|pages= 61|work= Kent State University Catalog 2004-2005|publisher= Kent State University}}</ref> started just three years after the school was established in 1910 as the Kent State Normal School and just one year after the first classes were held in 1912.  They played their first game against [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Kent, Ohio)|Kent High School]].  The team played in what is now Cartwright Hall,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://einside.kent.edu/?type=art&id=267|title= Extensive Improvements Made to University Auditorium|accessdate=2008-02-23 |author= Sopko, Jen|date= |work= eInside|publisher= Kent State University}}</ref> which opened in 1914, until Wills Gymnasium opened in 1923.  In 1950, the team moved to their current home, known originally as the Men's Physical Education Building, later to be known as Memorial Gym (1956<U+2013>1992) and currently as the [[Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center]].  The next year, 1951, saw Kent State join the [[Mid-American Conference]].  

The team existed in relative anonymity for most of its existence.  They made their first appearance in the MAC Tournament Championship game (which began in 1980) in 1984, losing a close 42-40<ref name=tourney>{{cite web |url= http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=cbask/ctour/2008/file.aspx?f=schedule,conf=mac|title= Mid-American Conference Basketball Tournament|accessdate=2008-03-08 |format= |work=www.sportsnetwork.com|publisher=The Sports Network}}</ref> game.  They would make the title game again in 1987<ref name=tourney/> and 1989,<ref name=tourney/> losing both 64-63 and 67-65 respectively.  The Flashes made their first post-season appearance in the [[1985 National Invitation Tournament]], losing in the first round.  They returned to the NIT in 1989 and 1990, losing in the first round both times.

===Beginnings of success===
In 1996, [[Gary Waters]] was hired as head coach and began to build what would become the longest run of success in Mid-American Conference history.  In 1999 the Flashes won over 20 games and defeated the [[Miami RedHawks]] in the MAC Tournament Championship game in [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] to win their first MAC Tournament title and make their first-ever [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearance,<ref name="success"/> where they were defeated by [[Temple Owls|Temple]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/scoreboards/1999/03/12/recap.temple.kent.html|title= NCAA Tournament Recap (Kent-Temple) |accessdate=2008-02-23 |author= Ticker|date= 1999-03-13|work= cnnsi.com|publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated}}</ref> in the opening round at  the [[TD Banknorth Garden|Fleet Center]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  The following season, the Flashes again won over 20 games and finished second in the MAC East, but failed to win the conference tournament and received their first NIT invitation since 1990.  The Flashes hosted the first round game against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Rutgers]] and recorded their first-ever post-season win, a 73-62 victory.  Kent State would win their second-round match-up at [[Villanova Wildcats|Villanova]] before falling in the quarterfinals at [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]].  The 2000-2001 season saw the Flashes win their first-ever MAC East title<ref name="success"/> and their second tournament title to return to the NCAA Tournament.  The experience in the NIT proved to be valuable as Kent State scored their first win, a 77-73 <ref>{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2001/03/15/iai_kae/|title= Kent State 77, Indiana 73|accessdate=2008-02-23 |author= Ticker|date= 2001-03-16|work= cnnsi.com|publisher= CNN/Sports Illustrated}}</ref> upset over the fourth-seeded [[Indiana Hoosiers]], before falling to the [[Cincinnati Bearcats]] in the second round in [[San Diego, California]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://static.espn.go.com/ncb/ncaatourney01/bracket.html|title= Men's NCAA Tournament 2001 Bracket|date= 2001-04-03|accessdate=2009-03-09 |work= ESPN.com}} The Kent State website incorrectly lists the score of Kent State's win as 76-71</ref>  At the end of the 2000-2001 season, Waters accepted the head coaching job at [[Rutgers University]].  While at KSU, Waters overall record was 92-60.  He was succeeded at Kent State by [[Stan Heath]], setting the stage for the most memorable season in Kent State basketball history.

===2001-2002 season===
Kent State enjoyed its best season in 2001-2002, led by seniors Trevor Huffman, Andrew Mitchell, Demetric Shaw, and Eric Thomas and junior transfer (and future [[National Football League|NFL]] star) [[Antonio Gates]].  The season saw MAC records set in overall wins (30), conference wins (17), and longest winning streak (21).<ref name="success">{{cite web |url= http://www.kentstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=47654&SPID=4464&DB_OEM_ID=11400&ATCLID=1178433|title= Postseason Success|accessdate=2008-02-23 |format= |work= The Kent State Experience|publisher= Kent State University Athletic Department}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  After beginning the season a mediocre 4-4, Kent State dramatically turned their season around by winning 20 of their next 21 games.  Following their only MAC loss of the season (a 66-65 loss at [[Buffalo Bulls basketball|Buffalo]]), they proceeded to win 15-straight games to close the regular season at 24-5 with a 17-1 record in the MAC and winning their first-ever MAC regular season title.  After winning the MAC Tournament, the Flashes found themselves seeded tenth in the South regional bracket.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/2002/ncaa_tourney/brackets/south.html|title= South Regional |accessdate=2008-02-23|work= cnnsi.com|publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated}}</ref>  After scoring a mild upset of the seventh-seeded [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/14/oag_kae/|title= Kent St. 69, Oklahoma St. 61|accessdate=2008-02-23 |author= Ticker|date= 2002-03-14|work= cnnsi.com|publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated}}</ref> the Flashes gained national attention by defeating second-seeded [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] champion [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]] 71-58<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/16/aaf_kae/|title= Kent St. 71, Alabama 58|accessdate=2008-02-23 |author= |date= 2002-03-16|work= cnnsi.com|publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated}}</ref>  to advance to the [[NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship#Regional_semifinals_and_finals|Sweet Sixteen]].

The Flashes 21-game winning streak and dream season came to an end in the Elite Eight with an 81-69 loss<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/recaps/2002/03/23/iai_kae/|title= Indiana 81, Kent St. 69 |accessdate=2008-02-23 |author= Ticker|date= 2002-03-23|work= cnnsi.com|publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated}}</ref>  to [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]].  The Flashes finished the season at 30-6 and were ranked twelfth in the final ESPN/USA Today [[Coaches poll]] released after the tournament.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/polls/02polls/espn.html|title= 2001-02 ESPN/USA Today Men's Basketball Poll (Final)|accessdate=2008-02-26 |author= ESPN/USA Today|year= 2002|work= CSTV.com|publisher= CSTV}}</ref>  Following the season, [[Stan Heath]] accepted the head coaching job at the [[University of Arkansas]], leaving after just one season and a record of 30-6.  Assistant coach Jim Christian was hired later that year as the next head coach.

===Jim Christian era===

The Flashes continued their success under [[Jim Christian]], winning over twenty games every season he was coach along with MAC East titles in 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008; MAC overall titles in 2006 and 2008; and winning the MAC Tournament again in 2006 and 2008.  In both 2003 and 2004, Kent State lost in the MAC Tournament championship game and received bids to the NIT.<ref name="success"/>  Following their 2006 MAC Tournament title, they advanced to the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] as a twelfth seed where they lost in the opening round.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=264000004|title= Gray, Ramon power Pitt to easy win over Kent State

===Geno Ford===
Geno Ford took over the program in 2008 and led the team to three winning seasons, including two regular season MAC Championships in the 2009<U+2013>10 and 2010<U+2013>11 seasons.  It was the first time a team had won successive MAC regular season championships since Miami in 1991 and 1992 and the first time a team had won two consecutive outright titles since Ball State in 1989 and 1990.  In 2011, KSU appeared in their 11th MAC Tournament Championship game, but fell in overtime.  Although the team failed to advance to the NCAA Tournament during Ford's tenure, they did have three consecutive post-season appearances including the [[2009 CollegeInsider.com Tournament]] and the [[2010 National Invitation Tournament|2010]] and [[2011 National Invitation Tournament|2011 NITs]].  Kent State advanced to the second round of the 2010 NIT, winning their first post-season game since the 2002 Elite Eight run, and advanced to the quarterfinals of the 2011 NIT with two road wins. Ford left the team to take the head coaching job at [[Bradley Braves men's basketball|Bradley University]] on March 27, 2011.  Ford finished with a 68<U+2013>37 record at Kent State.<ref>{{cite news |author=Alexander, Elton |title=Kent State basketball coach Geno Ford leaving for Bradley |url=http://www.cleveland.com/sports/college/index.ssf/2011/03/post_22.html |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=March 27, 2011 |accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref>

===Retired numbers===
{{Kent State Golden Flashes men's basketball retired numbers}}

==Rivalries==
Kent State's main rivalry is with the [[Akron Zips men's basketball|Akron Zips]], who are located just 14 miles from Kent. The rivalry includes other sports within the MAC, most prominently in football, but has been most competitive between the schools' men's basketball squads in recent years. Games at campus sites usually sell out due to the schools' close proximity with each other and the stakes attached to each game. During the 2006<U+2013>07 and 2007<U+2013>08 seasons the two teams faced each other three times each season<U+2014>including back-to-back conference tournaments<U+2014>with Akron winning all three meetings in 2007 and Kent State taking all three in 2008. The Zips eliminated the Flashes from the [[2007 MAC Men's Basketball Tournament]] with a 61<U+2013>54 semifinal win in Cleveland and Kent State routed the Zips 74<U+2013>55 in the [[2008 MAC Men's Basketball Tournament|2008 MAC Championship game]] in Cleveland to gain an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament bracket after narrowly taking both meetings in the regular season.  In 2009, a 67<U+2013>63 Kent State win at the [[Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center|MAC Center]] on March 9 prevented Akron from winning its first-ever MAC regular season title.  In 2010, the teams played each other in a nationally-televised game at the [[James A. Rhodes Arena]] in Akron to conclude the season with each team coming into the game with 12<U+2013>3 conference records and tied for first place in the MAC East Division and overall MAC standings.  Kent State defeated the Zips 74<U+2013>61 to claim the overall MAC title and top seed in the [[2010 MAC Men's Basketball Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kentstatesports.com/sports/mbkb/2010-11/releases/20110302ch9qbt |title=Reliving the Kent State - Akron Rivalry Over The Past Three Years |date=March 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |publisher=Kent State University |work=KentStateSports.com}}</ref>  The Flashes repeated the feat the following season, defeating the Zips March 4, 2011 at the [[Memorial Athletic and Convocation Center|MAC Center]] 79-68 in a nationally televised game to clinch the overall MAC regular season title and top seed in the tournament.<ref>{{cite news |title=KSU's outright stuff |url=http://www.recordpub.com/news/sports_article/4993243 |author=Carducci, David |date=March 5, 2011 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |newspaper=[[Record-Courier (Ohio)|Record-Courier]]}}</ref>
