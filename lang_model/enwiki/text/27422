The '''guinea pig''' (''Cavia porcellus''), also called the '''cavy''', is a species of [[rodent]] belonging to the family [[Caviidae]] and the genus ''[[Cavia]]''. Despite their [[common name]], these animals are not in the [[suidae|pig family]], nor are they from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]. They originated in the [[Andes]], and earlier studies based on biochemistry and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] suggested they are [[domestication|domesticated]] descendants of a closely related species of cavy such as ''[[Brazilian guinea pig|Cavia aperea]]'', ''[[Shiny Guinea Pig|C. fulgida]]'', or ''[[Montane Guinea Pig|C. tschudii]]'' and, therefore, do not exist naturally in the wild.<ref name=weir/><ref name=Walker>{{cite book|last = Nowak|first = Ronald M.|title = Walker's Mammals of the World, 6th edition|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0-8018-5789-9}}</ref> Recent studies applying molecular markers,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Spotorno, A.E., Mar<U+00ED>n, J.C., Manr<U+00ED>quez, G., Valladares, J.P., Rico, E. and Rivas, C. |title=Ancient and modern steps during domestication of guinea pigs (''Cavia porcellus'' L.)|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00117.x|year=2006|journal=Journal of Zoology|pages=060606025751032<U+2013><U+2013>}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2009.00561.x|title=Molecular systematics, taxonomy and biogeography of the genus Cavia (Rodentia: Caviidae)|year=2010|last1=Dunnum|first1=Jonathan L.|last2=Salazar-Bravo|first2=Jorge|journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research|volume=48|issue=4|pages=376<U+2013>388}}</ref> in addition to studying the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals,<ref>Spotorno, A.E., Manr<U+00ED>quez, G., Fern<U+00E1>ndez L., A., Mar<U+00ED>n, J.C., Gonz<U+00E1>lez, F. and Wheeler, J. 2007.

The guinea pig plays an important role in the [[folk culture]] of many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous South American]] groups, especially as a food source, but also in [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] and in community religious ceremonies.<ref name=morales>[[#Morales|Morales]]</ref> Since the 1960s, efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America.<ref name=cbs>{{cite news|last = Vecchio|first = Rick|title = Peru Pushes Guinea Pigs as Food|publisher = [[CBS News]]|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/19/world/main650148.shtml|date = 2004-10-19|accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref>

In [[Western culture|Western]] societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household [[pet]] since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature and responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to [[Animal fancy|competitive breeding]] of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many [[Guinea pig breed|specialized breeds]] of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.

Biological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as [[model organism]]s in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the [[epithet]] "guinea pig" for a [[human subject research|test subject]], but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as [[House Mouse|mice]] and [[Brown Rat|rats]]. They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as [[diabetes mellitus type 1|juvenile diabetes]], [[tuberculosis]], [[scurvy]], and [[pre-eclampsia|pregnancy complications]].

==History==
The common guinea pig was first [[domestication|domesticated]] as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the [[Andes|Andean]] region of [[South America]] (the present-day southern part of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]]),<ref name="Morales, p. 3">[[#Morales|Morales]], p. 3.</ref> some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American [[camelid]]s.<ref>{{cite book|ref=Chazan|last = Chazan|first = Michael|title = World Prehistory and Archaeology: Pathways through Time|year = 2008|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc.|isbn = 0-205-40621-1|page=272}}</ref> [[Statue]]s dating from ''[[circa]]'' 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in [[archaeology|archaeological]] digs in Peru and Ecuador.<ref>[[#Morales|Morales]], pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art.<ref>Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum.

[[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|English]] traders brought guinea pigs to [[Europe]], where they quickly became popular as [[exotic pet]]s among the upper classes and royalty, including [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]].<ref name="Morales, p. 3"/> The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from [[Santo Domingo]]; because cavies are not native to [[Hispaniola]], the animal was earlier believed to have been introduced there by Spanish travelers.<ref name=weir>{{Cite book|last = Weir|first = Barbara J.|contribution = Notes on the Origin of the Domestic Guinea-Pig|editor-last = Rowlands|editor-first = I.

==Name==
The scientific name of the common species is ''Cavia porcellus'', with ''[[wikt:la:porcus|porcellus]]'' being [[Latin]] for "little pig". ''Cavia'' is [[New Latin]]; it is derived from ''cabiai'', the animal's name in the language of the [[Galibi]] tribes once native to [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Cavy|publisher = Oxford English Dictionary online (subscription access required)|url = http://dictionary.oed.com|accessdate = 2007-04-25}}</ref> ''Cabiai'' may be an adaptation of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''<U+00E7>avia'' (now ''savia''), which is itself derived from the [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] word ''sauj<U+00E1>'', meaning rat.<ref>{{cite web|title = Definition of cavy|publisher = Merriam-Webster Online|url = http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=cavy|accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref> Guinea pigs are called ''quwi'' or ''jaca'' in [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and ''cuy'' or ''cuyo'' (plural ''cuyes, cuyos'') in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.<ref name=diccionario>{{cite web| title = Diccionario de la Lengua Espa<U+00F1>ola|publisher = Real Academia Espa<U+00F1>ola|url = http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/|language = Spanish|accessdate = 2007-03-12}}</ref> Ironically, [[Animal fancy|breeders]] tend to use the more formal "cavy" to describe the animal, while in scientific and laboratory contexts, it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial "guinea pig".<ref name=wagner>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 2</ref>

How the animals came to be called "pigs" is not clear. They are built somewhat like [[pig]]s, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they also spend a large amount of time eating.<ref name=wagner/><ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 2.</ref> They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a 'pig pen', and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe.<ref name=wagner/>

The animal's name alludes to pigs in many European languages. The [[German language|German]] word for them is ''[[wikt:Meerschweinchen|Meerschweinchen]]'', literally "little sea pig", which has been translated into [[Polish language|Polish]] as ''<U+015B>winka morska'', into [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''tengerimalac'', and into [[Russian language|Russian]] as ''<U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0441><U+0432><U+0438><U+043D><U+043A><U+0430>''. This derives from the [[Middle High German]] name ''merswin''. This originally meant "[[dolphin]]" and was used because of the animals' grunting sounds (which were felt to be similar).<ref>Duden <U+2013> Deutsches Universalw<U+00F6>rterbuch. 4. Aufl. Mannheim 2001. [CD-ROM]</ref> Many other, possibly less scientifically based explanations of the German name exist. For example, sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the [[New World]] would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat. The [[French language|French]] term is ''[[wikt:fr:cavia|cochon d'Inde]]'' (Indian pig) or ''cobaye''; the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] call it ''[[wikt:nl:cavia|Guinees biggetje]]'' (Guinean piglet) or cavia (while in some Dutch dialects it is called ''Spaanse rat''); and in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the guinea pig is variously referred to as ''[[wikt:pt:cobaia|cobaia]]'', from the Tupi word via its Latinization, or as ''porquinho da <U+00CD>ndia'' (little Indian pig). This is not universal; for example, the common word in Spanish is ''[[wikt:es:conejillo de Indias|conejillo de Indias]]'' (little rabbit of the Indies).<ref name=diccionario/> The Chinese refer to them as Holland pigs (<U+8377><U+862D><U+8C6C>, ''h<U+00E9>l<U+00E1>nzh<U+016B>''). The Japanese word for guinea pig is "<U+30E2><U+30EB><U+30E2><U+30C3><U+30C8>" (''morumotto''), which derives from the name of another mountain-dwelling rodent, the [[marmot]]; this is what guinea pigs were called by the Dutch traders who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843.

The origin of "guinea" in "guinea pig" is harder to explain. One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], leading people to think they had originated there.<ref name=wagner/> "Guinea" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may simply be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic appeal.<ref name=dictionary>{{cite web|title = Results for "Guinea pig"|publisher = Dictionary.com|url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Guinea%20pig|accessdate = 2006-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cavy}}</ref> Another hypothesis suggests the "guinea" in the name is a corruption of "[[The Guianas|Guiana]]", an area in [[South America]], though the animals are not native to that region.<ref name=dictionary/><ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], pp. 2<U+2013>3.</ref> A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea coin]]; this hypothesis is untenable, because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and [[William Harvey]] used the term "Ginny-pig" as early as 1653.<ref>{{cite book|last = Harvey|first = William|title = Anatomical exercitations concerning the generation of living creatures to which are added particular discourses of births and of conceptions, &c|year = 1653|page = 527}}</ref> Others believe "guinea" may be an alteration of the word [[wikt:coney|coney]] (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as "pig coneys" in [[Edward Topsell]]'s 1607 treatise on [[quadrupedalism|quadrupeds]].<ref name=wagner/>

In the 1990s, a [[Rodent#Monophyly or polyphyly?|minority scientific opinion emerged]] proposing that [[caviomorpha|caviomorphs]], such as guinea pigs, [[chinchilla]]s, and [[degu]]s, are not rodents and should be [[Taxonomy (biology)|reclassified]] as a separate [[order (biology)|order]] of mammals (similar to [[lagomorpha|lagomorphs]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last = Graur|first = D., et al.|title = Is the Guinea-Pig a Rodent?|year = 1991|journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume = 351|pages = 649<U+2013>652|doi = 10.1038/351649a0|last2 = Hide|first2 = Winston A.|last3 = Li|first3 = Wen-Hsiung|pmid = 2052090|issue = 6328}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = D'Erchia|first = A., et al.|title = The Guinea Pig is Not a Rodent|year = 1996|journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume = 381|pages = 597<U+2013>600|doi = 10.1038/381597a0|last2 = Gissi|first2 = Carmela|last3 = Pesole|first3 = Graziano|last4 = Saccone|first4 = Cecilia|last5 = Arnason|first5 = Ulfur|pmid = 8637593|issue = 6583}}</ref> Subsequent research using wider sampling has restored consensus among mammalian biologists that the current classification of rodents as [[monophyly|monophyletic]] is justified.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Carleton|first = Michael D.|last2 = Musser|first2 = Guy G.|contribution = Order Rodentia|editor-last = Wilson|editor-first = Don E.|title = Mammal Species of the World|edition = 3rd|year = 2005|volume = 2|page = 745|publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn = 0-8018-8221-4|editor3-last = Reeder|editor3-first = DeeAnn M.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = Huchon|first = D., et al.|url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/104/18/7495|title = Multiple molecular evidences for a living mammalian fossil|year = 2007|journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]]|volume = 104|pages = 7495<U+2013>7499|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0701289104|pmid = 17452635|last2 = Chevret|first2 = P|last3 = Jordan|first3 = U|last4 = Kilpatrick|first4 = CW|last5 = Ranwez|first5 = V|last6 = Jenkins|first6 = PD|last7 = Brosius|first7 = J|last8 = Schmitz|first8 = J|issue = 18|pmc = 1863447}}</ref>

===Natural habitat===
[[File:Guinea pig habitat.jpg|thumb|Tri-parti-colored (white, brown and black) guinea pig in its natural habitat]]

''C. porcellus'' is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from some closely related species of [[cavia|cavies]], such as ''[[Brazilian Guinea Pig|C. aperea]]'', ''[[Shiny Guinea Pig|C. fulgida]]'', and ''[[Montane Guinea Pig|C. tschudii]]'', which are still commonly found in various regions of South America.<ref name=weir/> Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as ''[[Cavia anolaimae|C. anolaimae]]'' and ''[[Cavia guianae|C. guianae]]'', may be domestic guinea pigs that have become [[feral]] by reintroduction into the wild.<ref name=walker/> Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an [[ecological niche]] similar to that of [[cattle]]. They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females (sows), a male (boar), and the young (which in a break with the preceding [[pig|porcine]] nomenclature are called pups). They move together in groups ([[herd]]s) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food.<ref name=wagner2>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], pp. 31<U+2013>32.</ref> While they do not [[burrow]] or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by [[vegetation]].<ref name=wagner2/> They  [[crepuscular|tend to be most active during dawn and dusk]], when it is harder for predators to spot them.<ref name=terril>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 6.</ref>

===Domestic habitat===
[[Domestication|Domesticated]] guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their [[neuroendocrine]] stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.scielo.br/pdf/bjmbr/v37n6/4930.pdf |format=PDF| last = Cohn|first = D.W.H. et al.|title = Female Novelty and the Courtship Behavior of Male Guinea Pigs|journal = Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research|volume = 37|year = 2004|pages = 847<U+2013>851|doi = 10.1590/S0100-879X2004000600010|pmid = 15264028|last2 = Tokumaru|first2 = RS|last3 = Ades|first3 = C|issue = 6}}</ref> Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present.<ref>[[#Vanderlip|Vanderlip]], pp. 33<U+2013>34.</ref> Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between.<ref name=terril/> Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular [[circadian rhythm|circadian]] patterns are apparent.<ref name=terril/>

Domestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as [[bumblefoot (infection)|bumblefoot]] (ulcerative pododermatitis).<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 63<U+2013>64.</ref> "Cubes and [[Coroplast]]" (or C&C) style cages are now a common choice.<ref name=ygph>{{cite web|title = Your Guinea Pigs' Home|publisher = Guinea Pig Cages|url = http://www.guineapigcages.com|accessdate = 2006-08-29}}</ref> Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material.

Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species.

===Behavior===
Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their strongest problem-solving strategy is motion.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Charters|first = Jessie Blount Allen|title = The associative processes of the guinea pig: A study of the psychical development of an animal with a nervous system well medullated at birth|journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology|volume = XIV|issue = 4|pages = 300<U+2013>337|publisher = University of Chicago|date=July 1904|url = http://books.google.com/?id=dWcKAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA300&lpg=RA2-PA300&dq=guinea+pigs#PRA1-PA299,M2|accessdate = 2006-12-27|doi=10.1002/cne.920140402}}</ref> While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, they are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile.

[[File:Three guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) at Keswick Public Library.jpg|thumb|Guinea pigs "social groom"]]
Like many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in [[social grooming]], and they regularly self-groom.<ref>[[#Vanderlip|Vanderlip]], p. 79.</ref> A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 72.</ref> Groups of boars often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture.<ref name=harkness/> Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), [[Goose bumps|piloerection]], aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 38.</ref> Non-sexual simulated [[wikt:mount#Verb|mounting]] for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.

Guinea pig sight is not as good as that of a human, but they have a wider angle of vision (about 340<U+00B0>) and see in partial color ([[dichromacy]]). They have well-developed senses of hearing, [[olfaction|smell]], and touch.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], pp. 32<U+2013>33</ref><ref>[[#Vanderlip|Vanderlip]], p. 14.</ref> Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species.<ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 7.</ref> These are the most common sounds made by the guinea pig:<ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], pp. 7<U+2013>8.</ref>
*A "wheek" is a loud noise, the name of which is [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]], also known as a whistle. An expression of general excitement, it may occur in response to the presence of its owner or to feeding. It is sometimes used to find other guinea pigs if they are running. If a guinea pig is lost, it may wheek for assistance. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Feeding Wheek.ogg|listen}}
*A bubbling or purring sound is made when the guinea pig is enjoying itself, such as when being petted or held. It may also make this sound when grooming, crawling around to investigate a new place, or when given food. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Happy.ogg|listen}}
*A rumbling sound is normally related to dominance within a group, though it can also come as a response being scared or angry. In these cases, the rumble often sounds higher and the body vibrates shortly. While courting, a male usually purrs deeply, swaying and circling the female<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 39.</ref> in a behavior called "rumblestrutting". A low rumble while walking away reluctantly shows passive resistance. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Keep Away.ogg|listen}}
*Chutting and whining are sounds made in pursuit situations, by the pursuer and pursuee, respectively. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Angry.ogg|listen}}
*A chattering sound is made by rapidly gnashing the [[tooth|teeth]], and is generally a sign of warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this sound.
*Squealing or shrieking is a high-pitched sound of discontent, in response to pain or danger. {{Audio|Guinea Pig In Distress.ogg|listen}}
*Chirping, a less-common sound, likened to [[bird vocalization|bird song]], seems to be related to stress, or when a baby guinea pig wants to be fed. Very rarely, the chirping will last for several minutes. {{Audio|Guinea Pig Chirping.ogg|listen}}

==Breeding==
[[File:Fat Adie pictures 001.jpg|thumb|right|Pregnant sow one week before delivering three pups]]

The guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; as many as five litters can be produced per year.<ref name=walker/> The [[gestation]] period lasts from 59<U+2013>72 days, with an average of 63<U+2013>68 days.<ref name=nrc/> Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and [[eggplant]]-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other [[rodents]], which are [[altricial]] at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight;<ref name=harkness/> they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to [[breastfeeding|suckle]]. [[Litter (animal)|Litters]] yield one to six pups, with an average of three;<ref name=richardson/> the largest recorded litter size is 17.<ref>{{cite book|year = 2007|title = Guinness Book of World Records|publisher = Guinness World Records Ltd.|page = 127|isbn = 978-1-904994-12-1}}</ref>

In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during labour due to over-sized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of [[stillbirth]], but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 88.</ref> Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.<ref name=percy>{{cite book|last = Percy|first = Dean H.|last2 = Barthold|first2 = Stephen W.|title = Pathology of Laboratory Rodents and Rabbits|publisher = Iowa State University Press|edition = 2nd|year = 2001|pages = 209<U+2013>247|isbn = 0-8138-2551-2}}</ref>

Guinea pigs also practice [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]], in which a female may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behavior is common, and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant.<ref>Riedman, Marianne L. (December 1982). <U+201C>The Evolution of Alloparental Care in Mammals and Birds<U+201D>. The Quarterly Review of Biology 57 (4): 405-435</ref>

Male and female guinea pigs do not [[sexual dimorphism|differ in external appearance]] apart from general size. The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 14, 17.</ref> The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.

[[File:Guinea baby 1.jpg|thumb|Guinea pig pup at eight hours old]]
Males reach sexual maturity at 3<U+2013>5 weeks; females can be fertile as early as four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 15<U+2013>16.</ref> Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the [[pubic symphysis]], a joint in the [[pelvis]], due to calcification which may occur between six and 10 months of age.<ref name=nrc/>{{rp|73|date=November 2012}}<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 16.</ref> If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to [[dystocia]] and death as they attempt to give birth.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 25<U+2013>26.</ref> Calcification of the female's pubic symphysis (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like [[ochronosis]]. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic symphysis does not calcify.<ref name=mdo>{{cite web|url = http://www.rbej.com/content/1/1/113|title = Guinea-pig interpubic joint (symphysis pubica) relaxation at parturition: Underlying cellular processes that resemble an inflammatory response|publisher = Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 2003, 1:113 doi:10.1186/1477-7827-1-113|accessdate = 2012-10-21}}</ref>
Females can become pregnant 6<U+2013>48 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be thus constantly pregnant.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref>

[[pre-eclampsia|Toxemia of pregnancy]] is common and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia, lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to [[ketone]]s, and [[seizure]]s in advanced cases.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 20<U+2013>21.</ref> Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 20.</ref> Other serious complications of pregnancy can include a [[prolapse|prolapsed uterus]], [[hypocalcaemia]], and [[mastitis]].<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 25<U+2013>29.</ref>

==Diet==
[[File:Cavy eating grass.jpg|thumb|right|A silver agouti guinea pig eating grass]]
[[File:Guinea Pig eating apple.JPG|thumb|A short-haired guinea pig eating a piece of apple]]

[[Grass]] is the guinea pig's natural diet. Their [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] are particularly suited for grinding plant matter, and grow continuously throughout the animal's life.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 228.</ref> Most grass-eating mammals are quite large and have a long digestive tract; while guinea pigs have much longer [[Colon (anatomy)|colons]] than most rodents, they must also supplement their diet by [[coprophagia|coprophagy]], the eating of their own feces.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 50<U+2013>51.</ref> However, they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately, but produce special soft pellets, called [[cecotrope]]s, which recycle [[B vitamins]], fiber, and bacteria required for proper digestion.<ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 41</ref><ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 236.</ref> The cecotropes (or caecal pellets) are eaten directly from the anus, unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese.<ref name=terril3/> They share this behaviour with [[rabbit]]s. In geriatric boars or sows (the condition is rarer in young ones), the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus for consumption can become weak. This creates a condition known as anal impaction, which prevents the boar from redigesting cecotropes, though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 52.</ref> The condition may be temporarily alleviated by carefully expelling the impacted feces.

Guinea pigs benefit from feeding on fresh grass hay, such as [[Timothy-grass|timothy hay]], in addition to food pellets which are often based from timothy. [[Alfalfa]] is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it,<ref>[[#Morales|Morales]], p. 8</ref><ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 32.</ref> though   some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a [[legume]] rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to [[obesity]], as well as [[bladder stone (animal)|bladder stones]] due to excess [[calcium]], in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs.<ref>{{cite web|title = Health, Care, and Diet for a Guinea pig|url = http://www.lakehowellanimalclinic.com/html/guinea_pig.html|publisher = Lake Howell Animal Clinic|accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = Guinea Pigs Care Sheet|url = http://www.canyonlakevet.com/guinea-pig.htm|publisher = Canyon Lake Veterinary Hospital|accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a source for replenishment of protein, [[amino acid]]s, and fiber.<ref>{{cite book|last = Institute for Laboratory Animal Research|title = Nutrient Requirements of Laboratory Animals|edition = 4th|publisher = National Academies Press|year = 1995|page = 106|url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4758&page=106|isbn = 0-309-05126-6}}</ref><ref name="Wagner, p. 236">[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 236</ref><ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 39.</ref>

Like humans, but unlike most other [[mammal]]s, guinea pigs cannot synthesize their own [[vitamin C]] and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal [[scurvy]]. Guinea pigs require about 10&nbsp;mg of vitamin C daily (20&nbsp;mg if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 92.</ref> Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]], and [[hydrogen ion]]s; adequate amounts of vitamins [[Vitamin E|E]], [[Vitamin A|A]], and [[Vitamin D|D]] are also necessary.<ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 40.</ref> Imbalanced diets have been associated with [[muscular dystrophy]], [[metastatic calcification]], difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], pp. 237<U+2013>257</ref><ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 89<U+2013>91.</ref> Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity.<ref name="Wagner, p. 236"/><ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 88<U+2013>89.</ref> They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types.<ref name=harkness/> A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 89.</ref> Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely [[wikt:gnaw|gnaw]], lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in [[rodent]]s.<ref name=ygph/> Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.

A number of plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including [[bracken]], [[Bryonia|bryony]], [[ranunculus|buttercup]], [[sinapis arvensis|charlock]], [[atropa belladonna|deadly nightshade]], [[digitalis|foxglove]], [[hellebore]], [[conium|hemlock]], [[lily of the valley]], [[Anthemis cotula|mayweed]], [[aconitum|monkshood]], [[privet]], [[Senecio|ragwort]], [[rhubarb]], [[veronica arvensis|speedwell]], toadflax (both ''[[Linaria vulgaris]]'' and ''[[Linaria dalmatica]]''), and [[vallisneria americana|wild celery]].<ref name=richardson3>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 93.</ref> Additionally, any plant which grows from a [[bulb]] (e.g., [[tulip]] or [[onion]]) is normally considered poisonous,<ref name=richardson3/> as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.

==Health==
[[File:mvc-872s.jpg|thumb|A parti-colored guinea pig suffering from [[torticollis]], or wry neck]]

Common ailments in domestic guinea pigs include [[Lower respiratory tract infection|respiratory tract infections]], [[diarrhea]], scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), [[abscess]]es due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches), and infections by [[louse|lice]], [[mite]]s, or [[fungus]].<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], ch. 1, 4, 5, 9.</ref>

Mange mites (''Trixacarus caviae'') are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched (due to pain), and, in some instances, seizures.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> Guinea pigs may also suffer from "running lice" (''Gliricola porcelli''), a small, white insect which can be seen moving through the hair; their eggs, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as "static lice". Other causes of hair loss can be due to hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as [[ovarian cyst]]s.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 55.</ref>

Foreign bodies, especially small pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to [[corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcer]].<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 69<U+2013>70.</ref> Hay or straw dust can also cause [[sneeze|sneezing]]. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of [[pneumonia (non-human)|pneumonia]], especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by [[torticollis]] and can be fatal.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 45<U+2013>48.</ref>

Because the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, it more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat.<ref name=wagner3>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 6.</ref> Its normal [[thermoregulation|body temperature]] is 101<U+2013>104<U+00B0>F (38<U+2013>40<U+00B0>C),<ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 19.</ref>  so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human's, about 65<U+2013>75<U+00B0>F (18<U+2013>24<U+00B0>C).<ref name=wagner3/> Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of {{convert|90|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}} have been linked to [[hyperthermia]] and death, especially among pregnant sows.<ref name=wagner3/> Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts,<ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 37.</ref> and respond poorly to extremes of [[humidity]] outside of the range of 30<U+2013>70%.<ref>[[#Terril|Terril]], p. 36.</ref>

Guinea pigs are [[Predation|prey]] animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most [[antibiotic]]s, including [[penicillin]], which kill off the [[gut flora|intestinal flora]] and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 229</ref><ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], pp. 105<U+2013>106.</ref>

Similar to the inherited [[genetic disorder|genetic diseases]] of other breeds of animal (such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] in canines), a number of genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported. Most commonly, the [[roan (color)#Roan Guinea Pigs|roan]] coloration of [[Guinea pig breed#Abyssinian|Abyssinian]] guinea pigs is associated with [[congenital disorder|congenital]] eye disorders and problems with the digestive system.<ref>[[#Richardson|Richardson]], p. 69.</ref> Other genetic disorders include "waltzing disease" (deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles), [[:wikt:palsy|palsy]], and [[tremor]] conditions.<ref name=robinson>{{Cite book|last = Robinson|first = Roy|contribution = The Guinea Pig, ''Cavia Porcellus''|editor-last = King|editor-first = Robert C|title = Handbook of Genetics|volume = 4|year = 1974|pages = 275<U+2013>307|publisher = Plenum|isbn = 0-306-37614-8}}</ref>

===Handling, temperament and socialization===
If handled correctly early in life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried, and seldom bite or scratch.<ref name=harkness/> They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself.<ref name="Vanderlip, p. 20"/> Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored.

===Appearance, coat and grooming===
[[Domestication|Domesticated]] guinea pigs occur in many breeds, which have been developed since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), which have a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with  [[cowlick]]s, or [[rosette (zoology)|rosettes]]. Also popular among breeders are the [[Guinea pig breed#Peruvian|Peruvian]] and the [[Guinea pig breed#Silkie or Sheltie|Sheltie]] (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the [[Guinea pig breed#Texel|Texel]], a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Guinea Pigs: The Right Pet for You?|journal=The Humane Society of the United States|date=April 21, 2010|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/guinea_pigs/tips/guinea_pigs_as_pets.html|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref>

===Clubs and associations===
Cavy clubs and associations dedicated to the showing and breeding of guinea pigs have been established worldwide. The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the [[American Rabbit Breeders' Association]], is the governing body in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title = Constitution|url = http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html|publisher = American Cavy Breeders Association|date = 2006-09-29|accessdate = 2007-03-22}}</ref> The [[British Cavy Council]] governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council)<ref>{{cite web|url = http://cavycouncil.org.au/|title = Official Website|publisher = Australian National Cavy Council|accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref> and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Club).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.upperhuttcommunity.net/cavyclub/index.html|title = Official Website|publisher = New Zealand Cavy Club|accessdate = 2007-04-03}}</ref> Each club publishes its own standard of perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.

===Allergies to pet guinea pigs===
[[Allergy|Allergic]] symptoms, including [[rhinitis]], [[conjunctivitis]], and [[asthma]], have been documented in laboratory animal workers who come into contact with guinea pigs.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">{{cite journal|title=Severe Allergic Reactions to Guinea Pig|journal=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health|date=Oct 27, 2005|volume=Clin Mol Allergy. 2005; 3: 14|issue=2005|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1282583/|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Occupational Health and Safety for Staff with Substantial Contact with GUINEA PIGS|url=http://www.iacuc.ucsf.edu/Safe/awOhsGuineaPig.asp|website=http://www.iacuc.ucsf.edu/|publisher=University of California San Francisco|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported.<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig [[dander]].<ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/> People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pet Allergy Causes: Rodents|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pet-allergy/basics/causes/con-20028932|website=www.mayoclinic.org|publisher=Mayo Clinic|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref> [[Allergy shots]] can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although treatment can take up to 18 months.

==Cultural and media influence==
[[File:Rene the long-haired Satin Peruvian Guinea pig.jpg|thumb|right|A lilac, orange, and white Satin Peruvian guinea pig (show-length coat)]]
As a result of their widespread popularity,  especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in [[literature]] include the short story "[[Pigs Is Pigs]]" by [[Ellis Parker Butler]], which is a tale of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] incompetence. Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are "pigs" or "pets" for the purpose of determining freight charges.<ref>{{cite book|last = Butler|first = Ellis Parker|title = Pigs is Pigs|publisher = McClure, Phillips & Co|year = 1906|isbn = 0-585-07104-7}}</ref> Butler's story, in turn, inspired the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]", written by [[David Gerrold]].<ref>Star Trek: the Original Series, [[Blu-ray]] edition, Season 2, Disc 4: "The Trouble with Tribbles", CBS Home Video: Catalog No. 07176</ref> In the [[Golden Hamster Saga]] books, two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso are modern-day thespians (named after [[Enrico Caruso]]) who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, [[Freddy Auratus]], that strongly dislikes their acting antics.

===In children's literature===
''[[The Fairy Caravan]]'', a novel by [[Beatrix Potter]],<ref>{{cite book|last = Potter|first = Beatrix|title = The Fairy Caravan|year = 1929|publisher = David McKay Co|isbn = 0-7232-4044-2}}</ref> and [[Michael Bond]]'s [[Olga da Polga]] series for children,<ref>{{cite book|last = Bond|first = Michael|title = The Tales of Olga da Polga|publisher = Macmillan|year = 2001|isbn = 0-19-275130-1}}</ref> both feature guinea pigs as the central [[protagonist]]. Another appearance is in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]]: in the first (chronologically) of his ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the [[Wood between the Worlds]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Lewis|first = C.S.|title = The Magician's Nephew|publisher = Macmillan|year = 1955|isbn = 1-56179-702-2}}</ref> In [[Ursula Dubosarsky]]'s ''Maisie and the Pinny Gig'', a little girl has a recurrent dream about a giant guinea pig, while guinea pigs feature significantly in several of Dubosarsky's other books, including the young adult novel ''The White Guinea Pig'' and ''The Game of the Goose''.<ref>[http://www.penguin.com.au/contributors/523/ursula-dubosarsky Ursula Dubosarsky]. penguin.com.au</ref>

===In film and television===
Guinea pigs have also been featured in film and television. In the TV movie ''[[Shredderman Rules]]'', the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs which play a minor part in the plot.

In [[English language|English]], the term 'guinea pig' is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation, or any experiment or test in modern times. This dates back to the early 20th century; the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913.<ref>{{cite web|title = Guinea-pig|publisher = Oxford English Dictionary online (subscription access required)|url = http://dictionary.oed.com|accessdate = 2007-02-22}}</ref> In 1933, [[Consumers Research]] founders [[F.

This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists [[William Ernest Castle|W. E.

Guinea pig [[strain (biology)|strains]] used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains.

Guinea pigs are also used extensively in reproductive studies because their placental structure is similar to humans and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans. They can also develop pregnancy toxemia.<ref>Elsevier Academic Press(2012). "The Laboratory Rabbit, Guinea Pig, Hamster, and Other Rodents" p. 705 American College of Laboratory Animal Medicine.

Guinea pigs (called ''cuy'', ''cuye'', or ''cur<U+00ED>'') were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people.<ref>[[#Morales|Morales]], p. 47.</ref> It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the [[Geography of Ecuador#La Sierra (the highlands)|Sierra]]) and Colombia.<ref>[[#Morales|Morales]], pp. xxvi, 4, 32.</ref> Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional [[livestock]] and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle;<ref name=Africa>{{cite journal|last = Nuwanyakpa|first = M. et al.|title = The current stage and future prospects of guinea pig production under smallholder conditions in West Africa|journal = Livestock Research for Rural Development|date=November 1997|volume = 9|issue = 5|url = http://www.lrrd.org/lrrd9/5/gp951.htm|accessdate = 2007-04-16}}</ref> moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment.
