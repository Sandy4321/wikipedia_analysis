'''Cyclone Lam''' in 2015 was the strongest storm to strike [[Australia]]'s [[Northern Territory]] since [[Cyclone Monica]] in 2006. It formed from the [[monsoon trough]] on February&nbsp;12 in the [[Coral Sea]]. For much of its duration, the system moved westward due to a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to the south. The system crossed over the [[Cape York Peninsula]] and moved into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], whereupon it gradually organized due to warm waters and favorable conditions. On February&nbsp;16, the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM) classified it as a Category&nbsp;1 [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale]] and gave it the name ''Lam''. The storm intensified further while drifting toward the [[Wessel Islands]], developing an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and strengthening to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on February&nbsp;18. It strengthened to reach [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph) early on February&nbsp;19 before turning to the southwest, making it a Category&nbsp;4 cyclone. That day, it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on Northern Territory between [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]] and [[Elcho Island]] at peak intensity, and it rapidly weakened over land. About six hours after Lam moved ashore, [[Cyclone Marcia]] struck [[Queensland]] as a Category&nbsp;5 cyclone, marking the first time on record that two storms of such intensity struck Australia on the same day.

In its formative stages, Lam produced heavy rainfall and flooding in [[Far North Queensland]]. Later, the cyclone's rainfall set daily precipitation records in Northern Territory. However, the winds caused the most damage, with gusts estimated as high as 230&nbsp;km/h (145&nbsp;mph). The highest gust was {{convert|170|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at Cape Wessel on [[Rimbija Island]]. Lam caused considerable destruction, particularly affecting local aboriginal communities. Total damage in the Northern Territory reached at least [[Australian dollar|A$]]82.4&nbsp;million ([[United States dollar|US$]]64.4&nbsp;million).

On February&nbsp;12, the [[monsoon trough]] extended through the [[Coral Sea]], developing a weak [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|tropical low]] in the northern portion of the sea, according to the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM).<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6WKdsn9Za|archivedate=February 14, 2015|date=February 12, 2015|title=Tropical Cyclone Three Day Outlook for the Coral Sea|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDQ10810.shtml}}</ref> The system had a persistent area of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, around a consolidating [[atmospheric circulation|circulation]].
