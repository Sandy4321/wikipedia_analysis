The '''County class''' were the first and last [[heavy cruiser]]s of the [[Royal Navy]]<!--- except for the raleigh class!--->. The ships were large, at 630[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]] (192[[metre|m]]), though they had no side armour when built. The ''County class'' were built in three sub-classes, that became known as the ''Kent'', ''London'' and ''Norfolk'' classes. They were built to the constraints of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922.

The design included a requirement for effective air defence, which led to problems in the main battery as the 8 inch guns were given 70<U+00B0> elevation, despite an initial lack of any form of fire control in the anti-aircaft role. Another requirement, for high cruising speed, led to large boiler capacity, high freeboard and a flush main deck, for 32&nbsp;knots in a high sea. The vessels had a good cruising range.

Seventeen ships were planned, but the final two, ''Northumberland'' and ''Surrey'' were cancelled as the 10,000 ton, 8 inch cruiser fell out of favour with the Royal Navy.

==Sub-classes==
===Kent class===
There were seven ships of the '''''Kent'' class''' built for the Royal Navy (HMS [[HMS Berwick|''Berwick'']], [[HMS Cornwall (56)|''Cornwall'']], [[HMS Cumberland (C57)|''Cumberland'']], [[HMS Dorsetshire (40)|''Dorsetshire'']], [[HMS Kent (68)|''Kent'']], [[HMS Norfolk (78)|''Norfolk'']] and [[HMS Suffolk|''Suffolk'']]) and two ships, HMAS [[HMAS Australia (1927)|''Australia'']] and [[HMAS Canberra (1927)|''Canberra'']], built for the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. All ships were commissioned in 1928. The ''Kents'' were heavily armed, having eight 8-[[inch]] (203[[millimetre|mm]]) guns in four twin-turrets. Their secondary armament consisted of four 4&nbsp;inch (102&nbsp;mm) single guns and also had eight [[2-pounder]] [[Pom-Pom (gun)|"pom-poms"]] for [[anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] defence.

The British ''Kents'' were reconstructed in the [[1930s]], with increases in armour and the number of 2&nbsp;pounder guns increased from eight to sixteen in two octuple mounts. Their eight 21&nbsp;inch (533&nbsp;mm) [[torpedo tube]]s were also removed, except for HMS ''Kent'' who retained them. Their secondary armament was increased with the addition of two twin 4&nbsp;inch (102&nbsp;mm) guns. One twin 8&nbsp;inch (203&nbsp;mm) turret was removed in 1941. Their aircraft hangar, which had been added before the war was removed during [[World War II]].

===London class===
The second sub-class, the '''''London'' class''', also known as the '''''Devonshire'' class''', consisted of four ships (HMS [[HMS Devonshire|''Devonshire'']], [[HMS London|''London'']], [[HMS Shropshire|''Shropshire'']] and [[HMS Sussex|''Sussex'']]) and were modified from the ''Kents''. The ''Londons'' were virtually identical to the ''Kents'', but differed in that their superstructure was altered slightly and internal bulges were added to give protection from torpedoes. Additionally the number of 2&nbsp;pounder guns was increased from eight to twelve.

In the 1930s, the Londons underwent similar alterations as the ''Kents'' did, having their eight 21&nbsp;inch (533&nbsp;mm) torpedo tubes removed, and one twin 8&nbsp;inch (203&nbsp;mm) turret removed, although ''London'' retained it. One ship, ''Shropshire'', was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy in 1943 to replace ''Canberra''. ''London'' was completely rebuilt just before, and during, World War II, giving her the appearance of a [[Crown Colony class cruiser|Crown Colony-class]] cruiser.

===Norfolk class===
The third sub-class, the '''''Norfolk'' class''', also known as the '''''Dorsetshire'' class''' consisted of the two ships ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire''. There would have been four ships but ''Northumberland'' and ''Surrey'' were cancelled. They were again similar to their predecessors, having only very slight differences, such as carrying the new lighter MkII turret for their 8&nbsp;inch guns, small differences to the superstructure, and an increase in the number of 2&nbsp;pounder guns from eight to sixteen. Like the previous two sub-classes, the ''Norfolk''s underwent a number of alterations in the 1930s, having their four 4&nbsp;inch (102&nbsp;mm) single guns replaced by twin-turrets. Their 2&nbsp;pounder pom-pom armament was increased to twenty-four barrels during World War II.

==World War II==
The ''County'' class saw much service during the Second World War.  HMS ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'' were equipped with [[radar]] which was used to good advantage when they shadowed the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] during the RN's attempts to hunt her down after the sinking of [[HMS Hood|HMS ''Hood'']].

The class saw service in nearly every theatre of the war. A number of losses were suffered by the class, with ''Canberra'', ''Cornwall'' and ''Dorsetshire'' all being destroyed.

The survivors were all decommissioned by the [[1950s]], except ''Cumberland'' which was an armaments trials ship testing the automatic 6 inch and 3 inch guns that would be fitted to the [[Tiger class cruiser|''Tiger'' class]]. She was scrapped in 1959.
