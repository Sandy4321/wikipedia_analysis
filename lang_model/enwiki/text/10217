'''Tim Richmond''' ([[June 7]], [[1955]] - [[August 13]], [[1989]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[race car]] driver from [[Ashland, Ohio]]. He competed in [[IndyCar]] racing before transferring to [[NASCAR]]'s Winston Cup Series (now [[Sprint Cup Series]]). Richmond was the first driver to change from [[Open wheel car|open wheel racing]] to NASCAR [[stock car racing|stock cars]], which has since become an industry trend.<ref name="NASCARPocono">{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2008/news/opinion/06/05/maumann.retro.trichmond.pocono/index.html|title=Richmond was always a threat to win at Pocono|last=Aumann|first=Mark|date=June 5, 2008|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> He won the [[1980 Indianapolis 500]] Rookie of the Year award and had 13 victories during eight NASCAR seasons.

Richmond achieved his top NASCAR season in 1986 when he finished third in points.<ref name="NASCARBio" /> He won seven races that season, more than any other driver on the tour.<ref name="NASCARBio">{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/drivers/02/02/trichmond/|title=Tim Richmond: NASCAR Winston Cup Career: 1980-87|publisher=NASCAR|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> When he missed the season-opening [[Daytona 500]] in February 1987, media reported that he had [[double pneumonia]].<ref name="NASCARBio" /> In actuality, Richmond had acquired [[HIV]] some time earlier, and his reported illness resulted from complications related to AIDS.

Richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a fast lifestyle, earning him the nickname "Hollywood".<ref name="People01081990" /> In describing Richmond's influence in the sport of racing, [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]] president [[Humpy Wheeler]] said: "We've never had a race driver like Tim in stock car racing.

==Early life==
Richmond grew up in Ashland, Ohio. His parents, Al and Evelyn (n<U+00E9>e Warner) Richmond, met in the course of their work. Al was a [[welder]] for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager.<ref name="Poole7">Poole, pages 7-17</ref> Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe, Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway. To market this invention, he founded Richmond Manufacturing, which eventually exported machines worldwide.<ref name="Poole7" />

Tim's driving days began when he was still a toddler, when he was given a [[kart racing|go-kart]] that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn.<ref name="Poole7" /> He later raced the kart at tracks in [[Moreland, Ohio|Moreland]] and [[New Pittsburg, Ohio|New Pittsburg]].<ref name="ACSHoF">{{cite news|url=http://www.ashlandcosportshof.org/Tim_Richmond.html|title=Tim Richmond|date=1996|publisher=[[Ashland County, Ohio|Ashland County]] Sports Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>

Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes treated differently by his classmates because of that background; therefore,  his parents decided to enroll him in Miami Military Academy in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]].<ref name="Poole7" /> During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio.<ref name="Poole7" /> While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local [[drag racing|drag racer]] [[Raymond Beadle]] through lifelong friend Fred Miller.<ref name="Poole7" /> When Richmond reached the age of 16, his parents purchased a [[Pontiac Trans Am]], a speedboat and a [[Piper Cherokee]] airplane for their son for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said "Tim was lazy...", and "... I did everything for him. I ruined him, I admit it. He was my whole life."<ref name="SI07201987" />

Richmond excelled in sports; he set a conference record in [[hurdling|high hurdles]] and his high school [[American football|football]] career was stellar enough that the academy [[Squad number#Retired numbers|retired]] his [[Jersey (clothing)#In sports|sports jersey]] after his gridiron days were over.<ref name="SI07201987">{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066200/index.htm|title=Fit, Fast And Feisty|last=Moses|first=Sam|date=July 20, 1987|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> In fact, Miami Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970.<ref name="ACSHoF" /> Richmond's other interests included flying, and he earned his [[private pilot license]] at age 16.<ref name="ACSHoF" /> Following high school graduation, Richmond attended [[Ashland University]] for about one year before dropping out.<ref name="Poole7" />

==Racing career==
===Open wheel racing===
A friend of Richmond's father co-owned a [[sprint car racing|sprint car]] and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto [[Lakeville Speedway]] at [[Lakeville, Ohio]] for some practice laps.<ref name="Poole7" />
"Somebody put a stopwatch on me," Richmond said. "I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It was the first time I had ever driven a race car."<ref name="Poole7" /> Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored #98 car in [[Pennsylvania]], which was the same number and [[livery|paint scheme]] that Richmond had used on model cars when he was a child.<ref name="Poole7" /> In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest [[List_of_motorsport_terminology#H|heat]]. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an [[axle]]. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, he parked the car for the rest of the event.<ref name="Poole7" /> Later that season, they towed the car to [[Eldora Speedway]], only to have Richmond crash the car again.<ref name="Poole7" /> In response Richmond's father fired him as the driver.<ref name="Poole7" /> The next season, Al Richmond bought a [[Modified_racing#SuperModifieds|SuperModified]], which was better suited to his son's driving style.  In 1977 Tim Richmond went on to become both [[Sandusky Speedway]]'s Rookie of the Year, and the supermodified class track champion at .<ref name="Poole7" />

Richmond returned to racing sprint cars in the [[United States Automobile Club]]'s (USAC) national sprint car tour in 1978.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Competing in 12 races, he finished 30th in points as the series' Rookie of the Year.<ref name="Poole7" /> That year he attended Jim Russell's road racing school at [[Willow Springs International Motorsports Park]], setting a student course record.<ref name="Poole7" /> Richmond raced in a 1978 Mini Indy car event at [[Phoenix International Raceway]], winning the [[Formula Vee]] support event in a [[Lola T620]].<ref name="Poole7" /> The win attracted sponsors and attention from major owners like [[Roger Penske]].<ref name="Poole7" /> He also competed in USAC's [[United States Automobile Club#USAC Silver Crown Series|Silver Crown series]].<ref name="IMHoF" />

Richmond's father bought an [[Anglo American Racers|Eagle]] [[Indy Car]] chassis and an [[Offenhauser]] engine for the 1979 race at [[Michigan International Speedway]].<ref name="Poole7" /> Richmond qualified 21st fastest with a {{convert|175.768|mph|km/h|adj=on|abbr=on}} lap, significantly slower than [[Bobby Unser]]'s {{convert|203.879|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[pole position]] speed.<ref name="Poole7" /> The race ended for him when his motor blew up on the fourth lap, and he finished last (23rd).<ref name="Poole7" /> Owner [[Pat Santello]] was looking for a driver to replace [[Larry Rice]] for his [[Champ Car|CART]] team at the [[Camping World Watkins Glen Grand Prix|following race]] at [[Watkins Glen International]], so he gave Richmond a test at Willow Spring where he had previously set the student record.<ref name="Poole7" /> Santello hired Richmond who then qualified 15th fastest for the event<ref name="Poole7" /> and finished in eighth place, the best of his IndyCar career.<ref name="Poole7" /> Richmond raced in three more events that season.<ref name="Poole7" />

After crashing during the first day of qualifying for the [[1980 Indianapolis 500]], Richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> To the delight of the crowd, winner [[Johnny Rutherford]] gave him a ride back to the pits.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> He was named the 1980 [[Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year]]. "I busted up a few Indy cars right after that," he said. "Milwaukee, Mid-Ohio.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at Michigan I cut one in two. I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt. So when I got an offer to drive stock cars, I took it, and it turned out I liked driving them better."<ref name="SI07201987" />

===NASCAR career===
[[Image:TimRichmond27racecar1983.jpg|thumb|left|1983 racecar]]
[[Pocono Raceway]] owner and founder Dr. Joseph Mattioli convinced Richmond to make the change to [[stock car racing]] on the NASCAR circuit.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Richmond made his first NASCAR start two months after winning the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> He debuted at Pocono in mid-1980, finishing 12th in a [[D. K. Ulrich]]-owned Chevrolet.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> That season, he competed in five events, with two [[List of motorsport terminology#D|DNFs]] (did not finish) and three 12th place finishes.<ref name="NASCARstats" /> Overall, he finished the 1980 season 41st in points.<ref name="NASCARstats" />

Richmond raced for three teams in 1981. He started the season by competing in 15 events for Ulrich.<ref name="RacingReference1981">{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet?id=richmti01&yr=1981&series=W|title=Tim Richmond 1981 driving statistics|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> He had his first career top 10 finish, taking sixth place at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], soon followed by a seventh place finish at [[Texas World Speedway]].<ref name="RacingReference1981" /> After [[Kennie Childers]] hired him away from Ulrich mid-season, Richmond had top 10 finishes at Pocono and [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]].<ref name="RacingReference1981" /> For the final seven races of the season, he drove for [[Bob Rogers]] and had a top 10 finish at [[Dover International Speedway]].<ref name="RacingReference1981" /> Overall for the season, Richmond had six top 10 finishes to place 16th in season points.<ref name="NASCARstats" />

[[File:RaymondBeadleTimRichmond.jpg|thumb|Richmond (right) talking with car owner [[Raymond Beadle]]]]
Richmond started 1982 without a ride before getting a one-race deal to drive for [[Billie Harvey]] at the [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] track. Richmond completed 112&nbsp;laps of the 492-lap event to finish 31st, retiring from the race with engine problems.<ref name="RacingReference1982">{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet?id=richmti01&yr=1982&series=W|title=1982 Drivers statistics|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> For the following event, Richmond was hired to drive [[J. D. Stacey]]'s #2 car. In his first race for the team, Richmond earned his first career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at [[Darlington Raceway]].<ref name="RacingReference1982" /> Returning to Pocono, he finished second, before winning his first race on the [[Riverside International Raceway|road course at Riverside, California]] the following week.<ref name="RacingReference1982" /> Later that season, he earned his first [[pole position]] at Bristol.<ref name="NASCARstats" /> The tour returned to Riverside for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race, sweeping both events at the track.<ref name="RacingReference1982" /> [[Benny Parsons]] said that "watching Richmond go through the Esses was unbelievable".<ref>{{cite episode |title=[[Benny Parsons]]' commentary, ESPN 26 hour marathon for the Top NASCAR races as it turns 50 years old at [[Riverside International Raceway]] |network=[[ESPN2]] |station=[[ESPN]] |airdate=1999 |minutes=1:00}}</ref> For the season, Richmond had twelve top 10s, two wins, and one pole to finish 26th in points.<ref name="NASCARstats" />

In 1983, Richmond began racing for [[Raymond Beadle]]<ref name="IMHoF" /> whom he had known before he started racing. He returned to the [[Tri-oval|three-cornered]] Pocono racetrack, earning his first oval victory.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> During the season, he accumulated four pole positions (Darlington, Pocono, [[Lowe's Motor Speedway|Charlotte]], and [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]]), one win (Pocono), and fifteen top 10s on his way to finishing tenth in season points.<ref name="NASCARstats" /> He made his first appearance in a NASCAR Busch Series (now [[Nationwide Series]]) car, but did not finish any of the three races he entered that season.<ref name="NASCARBuschStats">{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/drivers/dps/trichmon00/bg/index.html|title=NASCAR Busch Series driver's statistics|publisher=NASCAR|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>

[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire magazine]] named Richmond as one of "the best of the new generation" in 1984.<ref name="ACSHoF" /> That year he had one win at [[North Wilkesboro Speedway]] and second place finishes at Dover, Darlington and Riverside.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/drivers/dps/trichmon00/cup/data/1984/index.html|title=Tim Richmond's 1984 Winston Cup driver's statistics|publisher=NASCAR|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref> Richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points, with 11 finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5.<ref name="NASCARstats" />

1985 was the final season that Richmond competed for Beadle.<ref name="IMHoF" /> That year his best finish was a second place run at Bristol. He ended the season 11th in points with 13 Top 10s in 28 races.<ref name="NASCARstats" /> In the Busch Series, he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered, and won the Charlotte race.<ref name="NASCARBuschStats" />

Richmond joined [[Hendrick Motorsports]] in 1986, where he teamed up with veteran [[crew chief]] [[Harry Hyde]].<ref name="IMHoF" /> It took the team until the middle of the season to gel.<ref name="IMHoF" /> Richmond had suffered a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the [[Pocono 500|Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500]] at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the "[[oversteer|push]]", the car was more to his liking.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race,<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> [[Dale Earnhardt]] made up three seconds on Richmond's five-second lead.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> With four laps to go, [[Buddy Arrington]] spun in a three-car accident.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> He had led 97 laps, including the final 30, taking his first victory in a [[Rick Hendrick]] car.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> The tour returned to Pocono a month later, and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog-shortened event.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> In the final 8-lap sprint, Richmond competed in a three-car battle with [[Geoff Bodine]] and [[Ricky Rudd]].<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Richmond crossed the finish line beside Rudd, winning the race by 0.05 seconds.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> He notched four more victories that season, and over a span of twelve races, Richmond earned three second place finishes, and six wins.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /><ref name="Richmond-1986-stats">{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet?id=richmti01&yr=1986&series=W|title=Tim Richmond 1986 Winston Cup Results|publisher=racing-reference.info|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> The [[National Motorsports Press Association]] named him Co-Driver of the Year with [[Dale Earnhardt]] after Richmond accumulated 13 top 5 finishes and 16 in the top 10.<ref name="ACSHoF" /> He had a career-best third place finish in points after winning seven events.<ref name="NASCARstats" /> 1986 was to be Richmond's final full season of competition in NASCAR.

When Richmond missed the 1987 [[Daytona 500]], his condition was reported as [[double pneumonia]].<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Media later reported that he had tested positive for [[AIDS|acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS).<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> He returned to Pocono for the [[Miller High Life 500]] during the middle of the year.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Starting third, he had the lead by the fifth lap.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Ultimately, he led 82&nbsp;laps, including the final 46, to win the race by eight car-lengths over [[Bill Elliott]].<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> In the middle of the race, Richmond's car suffered gearbox problems. Because he was able to use only fourth (high) gear,<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Richmond was emotional after the victory, saying, "I had tears in my eyes when I took the checkered flag. Then every time anyone congratulated me, I started bawling again."<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside,<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> and made his final start at [[Michigan International Speedway]]'s [[Champion Spark Plug 400]] that August, finishing 29th.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> He resigned from [[Hendrick Motorsports]] in September 1987.<ref name="HistoryChannel">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=7465|title=Tim Richmond wins first Winston Cup race|publisher=[[History Channel]]|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>

Although Richmond attempted a comeback in 1988, NASCAR suspended him for testing positive for a banned substance.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /> The substance was identified as a non-prescription over-the-counter allergy and respiratory medication.<ref name="NYTimesObit" /> In April 1988 Richmond sued NASCAR over the suspension.<ref name="NYTimesObit" /> Although he retested later that year and was reinstated by NASCAR, he was unable to find a car owner to sign him.<ref name="NYTimesObit" /> In his last public appearance in February 1988, Richmond denied that he [[drug abuse|abused drugs]] and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test.<ref name="NYTimesObit" />

==Later life and death==
During the time that Richmond was hospitalized in 1989, the television broadcasting group [[ESPN]] sent a get-well-soon card to Richmond when it aired the July NASCAR race at Pocono.<ref name="Poole5">{{cite book|last=Poole|first=David|title=Tim Richmond: The Fast Life and Remarkable Times of NASCAR's Top Gun|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|date=2005|pages=5|isbn=158261833X|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6fW22O6w1RUC&pg=PP12&lpg=PP12&dq=%22tim+richmond%22+book&source=bl&ots=WlJH_ut5DN&sig=A0XXtMgTCZ3gtJG9pNHIlJE2K8c&hl=en&ei=1j6iSfTCJJSaNYjVgc0L&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result#PPA5,M1}}</ref> The television network showed highlights of Richmond's victory at the track from three&nbsp;years earlier.<ref name="Poole5" /> "Tim had [[Hollywood]] good looks and the charisma of [[Tom Cruise]]," said his friend [[Jerry Punch|Dr. Jerry Punch]]. "There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him. It was important for the people at the hospital to see Tim the way he really was, when he was healthy and handsome and vital, not the way he was when he was as they saw him every day in the hospital."<ref name="Poole5" />

According to Punch, Richmond was hospitalized for a motorcycle accident shortly before his death.<ref name="NYTimesObit" /> He died on August 13, 1989 at [[Good Samaritan Medical Center]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], about two years after his final NASCAR race.<ref name="NASCARPocono" /><ref name="NYTimesObit">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DB1539F935A2575BC0A96F948260|title=Obituaries: Tim Richmond, 34, Auto Racer |date=August 16, 1989|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> He was buried in Ashland, Ohio.<ref name="People01081990" /> The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days.<ref name="NYTimes08241989" /> On August 23, his death was revealed to be caused by AIDS, which he had acquired from an unknown woman.<ref name="NYTimes08241989">
