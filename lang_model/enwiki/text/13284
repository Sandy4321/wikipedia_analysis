"Unruhe" earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 11.7, being watched by 19.10 million people upon its initial broadcast.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate features a man who kidnaps women and [[Lobotomy|lobotomizes]] them. The agents' only clues to catching him are distorted photos of the victims taken just before their kidnapping.

Gilligan wrote the episode after being inspired by stories of serial killers he read as a child. Other inspirations include the concept of thought-photographs, and common fears associated with dentist chairs. The episode received a generally positive reception, though critics criticized the plotline featuring Scully being kidnapped. Critical attention also expressed a positive opinion of how scary the episode was in nature. Guest actor Taylor Vince received positive reviews as the episode's antagonist. 

== Plot ==

In [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]], [[Michigan]], a young woman goes to a local pharmacy to get her passport photo taken. While waiting for it to develop, she returns to her car and finds that her boyfriend has been murdered. The hooded killer renders Lefante unconscious with a [[hypodermic needle]], then kidnaps her. Meanwhile, in the pharmacy, the elderly clerk discovers Lefante's developed photo, showing her screaming amidst a distorted background. 

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) join the case. When discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about [[Ted Serios]], who was famous for taking "thoughtographs", photos which showed what was in his mind. Mulder takes pictures using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear the same as the one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims. 

Lefante turns up alive, but appears to have been given an improperly-performed lobotomy. Another woman, Alice Brandt, is kidnapped. She wakes up bound in a dentist's chair with her kidnapper brandishing an ice pick and speaking in German. Mulder returns to [[Washington, D.C.]] to examine the photos and finds no evidence that they were doctored. By closely examining the photos, he finds the face of an old man as well as the shadow of the kidnapper. Scully, finding a construction company referenced at both crime scenes, investigates the possible lead, meeting Gerry Schnauz ([[Pruitt Taylor Vince]]), who worked near both scenes of the kidnapping. The man attempts to run by Scully pursues and catches him. The agents interrogate Schnauz, who was once [[Psychiatric hospital|institutionalized]] for beating his father with an axe handle. When questioned on the location of Brandt, Schnauz claims she is safe from the "howlers". Brandt is soon found in the woods, lobotomized. Mulder believes that Schnauz thinks he is rescuing his victims from howlers and that the photos show his nightmares.

Schnauz manages to escape police custody and then robs a nearby drug store, taking cameras, film, and an assortment of drug-related materials. While investigating the robbery, Scully is knocked unconcious and is kidnapped by Schauz. Mulder heads to the office where Schnauz's father used to work as a dentist, and finds the chair missing. Scully awakens bound to the chair with Schnauz claiming he's going to kill the howlers in her head. Schnauz takes a photo of himself, then prepares to lobotomize Scully. Mulder, having found a clue in the photo of Scully from the drugstore, finds a trailer in a cemetery and realizes it belongs to Schnauz. He manages to break in and shoot Schnauz in the nick of time. Mulder looks at the photo Schnauz took, in which he is lying dead on the floor.<ref name="offprod" /><ref>Soter (2001), p. 204</ref>

Writer [[Vince Gilligan]] was inspired to write the episode based on ''[[Time-Life]]'' mail order books he read as a child discussing the lives of serial killers.<ref name="offprod">Meisler (1998), pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref> One of the books featured mass murderer [[Howard Unruh]].<ref name="offprod" /> The episode was also inspired by [[Ted Serios]], whose thought-photographs were mentioned by [[Fox Mulder]] in the episode.<ref name="offprod" /> The use of the dentist chair where Schnauz sat his victims was included considering people's common fear of the dentist.<ref name="offprod" /> Gilligan had written the role of Schnauz with Taylor Vince in mind when he saw him in the [[Adrian Lyne]] film ''[[Jacob's Ladder (film)|Jacob's Ladder]]''.<ref name="offprod" /> Vince had been approached to be a guest star on the show in the first season but declined the role due to it being too small.<ref name="offprod" /> 

Most of the scenes featuring Schnauz on plasterer's stilts were shot using stuntmen.<ref name="offprod" /> In the scene where Scully meets Schnauz using them a safety cable was attached to Vince to keep him upright that was edited out in post-production.<ref name="offprod" /> Ken Hawryliw created the lobotomy instrument Schnauz used from scratch when he was unsuccessful with his attempts to borrow one from a doctor or hospital.<ref name="offprod" /> The title of the episode, "Unruhe", is the German word for "unrest" or "anxiety". When Scully talks in German to Schnauz, she says "Ich habe keine Unruhe" (literally "I do not have anxiety").<ref name="offprod" /><ref>Gradnitzer (1999), p. 120</ref> The episode prominently features the drug [[scopolamine]] which can cause people to quickly become unconscious, and [[twilight sleep]], which is a condition that can render people unconscious following great moments of pain.<ref name="offprod" />

Once the producers of the show knew that they would be moving to Sundays starting with the fourth episode of the season, they decided to push this episode back, feeling that it would be an excellent representative of the show for its first Sunday night episode and a better representative than the fourth episode of the season filmed, "[[Teliko]]".<ref name="offprod" />

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the episode a "C", feel that the "interesting concept" of the psychic photographs were ruined by "boilerplate Scully-in-distress shtick".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295175,00.html|title=X Cyclopdia: The Ultimate Episode Guide, Season IV|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 29, 1996|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref> Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' was more positive, grading it as a "B+". He felt that its "greatest virtue" was being terrifying and that it worked for being an "urban fairytale".

Taylor Vince's performance as Gerry Schnauz received positive critical attention.
