'''Corrado Grabbi''' (born [[July 29]], [[1975]] in [[Turin]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Association football|football]] player. He plays as a [[striker]], most recently for [[AC Bellinzona|Bellinzona]].

Grabbi began his career with [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] youth team. He was promoted to first team and scored on his debut against Lazio, in one of his total two appearances in the 1994-1995 season. Unable to break into the team, because of his young age and  
the contemporary explosion of [[Alessandro Del Piero]], he was loaned to [[A.S. Lucchese-Libertas|Lucchese]] (76 games, 88 goals) and then [[A.C. ChievoVerona|Chievo]] (18 games, 2 goals) before switching to [[Modena F.C.|Modena]]. There he found some real form, scoring 88 times in 70 appearances. This performance saw him signed by [[Ternana Calcio|Ternana]], where he played for one season before been loaned to [[Ravenna|Ravenna Calcio]] where he scored 13 goals. Back to Ternana he was again a regular scorer, with 91 goals in 84 games and became idol for the local supporters, who still remember him as the best player to ever have played for  
Ternana.

His brilliant season with Ternana saw him attract attention of various Serie A clubs, including Udinese and AC Milan. But apparently [[Luciano Moggi]] of Juventus, who had previously pressured Grabbi to change his agent and join [[GEA|GEA World]] with no success, made it impossible for Ciccio to play in Italy, so in 2001 he was signed by [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] for a record fee of <U+00A3>6.75 million in July [[2001-02 in English football|2001]], but due to injuries and sheer lack of talent he failed to repeat this progress, scoring just once in fourteen games. Grabbi's move to Blackburn is widely regarded as one of the worst transfers in the history of the English Premier League.[http://www.ave-it.net/Football%20Transfer%20flops.htm][http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article2096584.ece][http://www.soccermanager.com/blog/soccer-news/top-25-worst-transfers.html]

A loan spell back in Italy with [[F.C. Messina Peloro|Messina]] where he scored 2 goals in the final game and saved Messina from relegation, failed to reignite his form, and after a further 16 games (and 1 last minute goal in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2217083.stm]) with Blackburn, who had meantime signed ex-Manchester United strikers [[Yorke|Dwight Yorke]] and [[Cole|Andy Cole]], he was allowed to return to Italy permanently with [[A.C. Ancona|Ancona]] in 2004. 
After spending 1 year without a team, trying to recover from the injury caused by a rare form of foot disease (Leveraus Morb) which had afflicted him for the past 3 seasons, he joined [[Genoa Cricket & Football Club|Genoa]] of [[Serie C|Serie C1/A]] in September [[2005]]. With his new team, he gained promotion to Serie B on playoffs scoring 9 goals in 25 games.

Before the return playoff final, Grabbi announced he was considering retiring from football, because of his physical conditions, but later he declared he was persuaded to go on by the Genoa supporters and fellow players, as well as club president [[Enrico Preziosi]]. Preziosi though decided then that Genoa did not need Grabbi anymore, so during the 2007 winter transfer window, Grabbi signed for [[A.C. Arezzo|Arezzo]], still in [[Serie B]], after having never made a single appearance in the first half of the season for Genoa. After relegation with Arezzo, scoring no goals, Grabbi signed a contract with [[AC Bellinzona]], a team from the [[Swiss Challenge League]] (second division). Ciccio scored the winning goal (his first after more than 1 year) in the Swiss Cup game Bellinzona-Gossau: 2-1[http://corradograbbi.blogspot.com/2007/12/grabbi-goal.html].

Grabbi was also directly involved in the [[Calciopoli]] scandal of summer 2006 as a victim: It was in fact only then that Ciccio could tell the media what Luciano Moggi had done to affect his career: after Ciccio Grabbi had refused to drop his Agent in favour of Luciano  Moggi's son, Moggi told him "''you will never play football again, if not in my garden!''" Grabbi was propriety of Juventus until he was sold to Ternana.
