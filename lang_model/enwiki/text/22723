'''Franklin Delano Roosevelt''' ([[January 30]], [[1882]] &ndash; [[April 12]], [[1945]]) served as the 32nd [[President of the United States]] and was elected to four terms in office.  He served from 1933-1945, and is the only President to serve more than two terms.  A central figure of the 20th century, [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|scholarly surveys]] rank him among the three greatest U.S. Presidents.

During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of  the 1930s, Roosevelt created the [[New Deal]] to provide relief for the unemployed, recovery of the economy, and reform of the economic system. His most famous legacies include the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security system]] and the [[Securities and Exchange Commission|regulation of Wall Street]]. His aggressive use of an active federal government reenergized the Democratic party. Roosevelt built the [[New Deal coalition]] that dominated politics into the 1960s. He and his wife [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] remain touchstones for American [[liberalism]].  The [[conservative]]s fought back, but Roosevelt consistently prevailed until he tried to [[Court packing|pack the Supreme Court]] in 1937, and the [[Conservative coalition]] formed to stop New Deal expansion.   

After 1938, Roosevelt championed rearmament and led the nation away from [[isolationism]] as the world headed into [[World War II]]. He provided extensive support to [[Winston Churchill]] and the British war effort before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] pulled the U.S. into the fighting. During the war, Roosevelt and the [[United States]] provided decisive leadership against [[Nazi Germany]] and made the United States the principal arms supplier and financier of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] who defeated [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Japan]]. Roosevelt led the United States as it became the [[Arsenal of Democracy]], putting 16 million American men and women into uniform. 

On the [[Homefront-United States-World War II|homefront]] his term saw the end of unemployment, restoration of prosperity, significant new taxes and controls, 120,000 Japanese and Japanese Americans sent to relocation camps, and new opportunities opened for African Americans and women.  As the Allies neared victory, Roosevelt played a critical role in shaping the post-war world, particularly through the [[Yalta Conference]] and the creation of the [[United Nations]]. Roosevelt died on the eve of victory in World War II and was succeeded by Vice President [[Harry S. Truman]].  

Roosevelt's administration redefined [[liberalism]] for subsequent generations and [[Realigning election|realigned]] the [[History of the United States Democratic Party |Democratic Party]] based his the New Deal coalition on labor, ethnic and racial minorities, the South, big city machines, and the poor.  

==Personal life==
===Early life ===
{{see also2|Roosevelt family|Delano family}}

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on [[January 30]], [[1882]], in [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]], in the [[Hudson River]] valley in [[upstate New York|upstate]] [[New York]]. His father, [[James Roosevelt, Sr.]], and his mother, [[Sara Roosevelt|Sara Ann Delano]], were each from wealthy old New York families. Franklin was their only child. 

Roosevelt grew up in an atmosphere of privilege. Sara was a possessive mother, while James was an elderly and remote father (he was 54 when Franklin was born). Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin's early years.<ref>''Eleanor and Franklin'', Lash (1971), 111 et seq.</ref> Frequent trips to [[Europe]] made Roosevelt conversant in [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. He learned to ride, shoot, row, and play [[polo]] and [[lawn tennis]]  The fact that his family were Democrats, however, set him apart to some extent from most other members of the [[Hudson Valley]] aristocracy. 

Roosevelt went to [[Groton School]], an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] boarding school in [[Massachusetts]]. He was heavily influenced by the headmaster, [[Endicott Peabody (educator)|Endicott Peabody]], who preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service. While Roosevelt was at Harvard, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became President, and his vigorous leadership style and reforming zeal made him Franklin's role model. In 1903, he met his future wife Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, Theodore's niece, at a [[White House]] reception. (They had previously met as children, but this was their first serious encounter.) They married two years later in 1905. 

Roosevelt next attended [[Columbia University|Columbia Law School]]. He passed the [[bar exam]] and completed the requirements for a law degree in 1907 but did not attend graduation. In 1908 he took a job with the prestigious Wall Street firm of [[Carter, Ledyard and Milburn]], dealing mainly with [[corporate law]].

===Marriage and family life===
Roosevelt was engaged to his distant cousin, Eleanor, despite the fierce resistance of his mother. They were married [[March 17]], [[1905]], with Theodore Roosevelt standing in for Eleanor's deceased father [[Elliott Roosevelt I|Elliott]]. The young couple moved into a house bought for them by Roosevelt's mother, who became a frequent house guest, much to Eleanor's chagrin. Roosevelt was a charismatic, handsome, and socially active man. In contrast, Eleanor was painfully shy and disliked social life, and at first she desired nothing more than to stay at home and raise their children. They had six children in rapid succession:

*[[Anna E. Roosevelt|Anna Eleanor]] (1906&ndash;1975),
*[[James Roosevelt|James]] (1907&ndash;1991),
*Franklin Delano, Jr. (March 1909&ndash;November 1909),
*[[Elliott Roosevelt|Elliott]] (1910&ndash;1990),
*a second [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr.|Franklin Delano, Jr.]] (1914&ndash;1988), and
*[[John Aspinwall Roosevelt|John Aspinwall]] (1916&ndash;1981).

[[Image:ER FDR Campobello 1903.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eleanor and Franklin at Campobello Island in 1903.]] 

The five surviving Roosevelt children all led tumultuous lives overshadowed by their famous parents. They had among them nineteen marriages, fifteen divorces and twenty-nine children. All four sons were officers in World War II and were decorated, on merit, for bravery. Their postwar careers, whether in business or politics, were disappointing. Two of them were elected briefly to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] but none were elected to higher office despite several attempts.

Roosevelt soon found romantic outlets outside his marriage. One of these was Eleanor's social secretary [[Lucy Mercer]], with whom Roosevelt began an affair soon after she was hired in early 1914. In September 1918, Eleanor found letters in Franklin's luggage which revealed the affair. Eleanor confronted him with the letters and demanded a divorce. While the marriage survived, Eleanor established a separate house in Hyde Park at [[Valkill]], and their relationship often seemed more like that of friends and political colleagues living separate lives.

===Paralytic illness===
{{Main|Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness}}

In August 1921, while the Roosevelts were vacationing at [[Campobello Island, New Brunswick]], Roosevelt contracted an illness, at the time believed to be [[poliomyelitis|polio]], which resulted in Roosevelt's total and permanent paralysis from the waist down. For the rest of his life, Roosevelt refused to accept that he was permanently paralyzed. He tried a wide range of therapies, including hydrotherapy, and in 1926, he purchased a resort at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], where he founded a hydrotherapy center for the treatment of polio patients which still operates as the [[Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation]]. After he became President, he helped to found the [[National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis]] (now known as the [[March of Dimes]]). His leadership in this organization is one reason he is commemorated on the [[Dime (United States coin)|dime]].

At a time when media intrusion in the private lives of public figures was much less intense than it is today, Roosevelt was able to convince many people that he was in fact getting better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. Fitting his hips and legs with iron braces, he laboriously taught himself to walk a short distance by swiveling his torso while supporting himself with a cane. In private he used a wheelchair, but he was careful never to be seen in it in public. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.

In 2003, a peer-reviewed study<ref>Goldman, AS ''et al'', [http://www.rsmpress.co.uk/jmb_2003_v11_p232-240.pdf ''What was the cause of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's paralytic illness?'']. J Med Biogr. 11: 232-240 (2003)</ref> found that it was more likely that Roosevelt's paralytic illness was actually [[Guillain-Barr<U+00E9> syndrome]], not poliomyelitis.

==Early political career==
[[Image:Franklin Roosevelt Secretary of the Navy 1913.jpg|thumb|right|200px|FDR as Assistant Secretary for the Navy]]
===State Senator===
In 1910, Roosevelt ran for the [[New York State Senate]] from the district around Hyde Park, which had not elected a Democrat since 1884. The Roosevelt name, Roosevelt money and the Democratic landslide that year carried him to the state capital of [[Albany, New York]], where he became a leader of a group of reformers who opposed Manhattan's [[Tammany Hall]] machine which dominated the state Democratic Party. Roosevelt soon became a popular figure among New York Democrats. 

===Assistant Secretary of the Navy===
Roosevelt took the position as Assistant Secretary of the [[United States Navy|Navy]] under [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1912. In 1914, he was defeated in the Democratic primary for the [[United States Senate]] by Tammany Hall-backed [[James W. Gerard]]. From 1913 to 1917, Roosevelt worked to expand the Navy and founded the [[United States Navy Reserve]]. Wilson sent the Navy and [[U.S. Marines|Marines]] to intervene in [[Central America]]n and [[Caribbean]] countries. Roosevelt personally wrote the constitution which the U.S. imposed on [[Haiti]] in 1915. 

Roosevelt developed a life-long affection for the Navy. He showed great administrative talent and quickly learned to negotiate with Congressional leaders and other government departments to get budgets approved. He became an enthusiastic advocate of the submarine and also of means to combat the German submarine menace to Allied shipping: he proposed building a mine barrage across the [[North Sea]] from [[Norway]] to [[Scotland]]. In 1918, he visited Britain and France to inspect American naval facilities. During this visit he met Winston Churchill for the first time. With the end of the war in November 1918, he was in charge of demobilization, although he opposed plans to completely dismantle the Navy.

===Campaign for Vice-President===

The 1920 [[Democratic National Convention]] chose Roosevelt as the candidate for [[Vice-President of the United States]] on the ticket headed by Governor [[James M. Cox]] of Ohio, helping build a national base. The Cox-Roosevelt ticket was heavily defeated by Republican [[Warren Harding]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1920]]. Roosevelt then retired to a New York legal practice, but few doubted that he would soon run for public office again.

===Governor of New York, 1928-1932===
{{main|Franklin D. Roosevelt's terms as Governor of New York}}

By 1928, Roosevelt believed he had recovered sufficiently to resume his political career. He had been careful to maintain his contacts in the Democratic Party and had allied himself with [[Alfred E. Smith]], the current governor and the Democratic Party presidential nominee in 1928. 

To gain the Democratic nomination for the election, Roosevelt had to make his peace with Tammany Hall, which he did with some reluctance. Roosevelt was elected Governor by a narrow margin, and came to office in 1929 as a reform Democrat. As Governor, he established a number of new social programs, and began gathering the team of advisors he would bring with him to Washington four years later, including [[Frances Perkins]] and [[Harry Hopkins]].

The main weakness of Roosevelt's gubernatorial administration was the corruption of the [[Tammany Hall]] machine in [[New York City]]. Roosevelt had made his name as an opponent of Tammany, but needed the machine's goodwill to be re-elected in 1930. As the 1930 election approached, Roosevelt set up a judicial investigation into the corrupt sale of offices. In 1930, Roosevelt was elected to a second term by a margin of more than 700,000 votes, defeating Republican [[Charles H. Tuttle]].

==1932 presidential election==
Roosevelt's strong base in the largest state made him an obvious candidate for the Democratic nomination, which was hotly contested since it seemed clear that [[Herbert Hoover]] would be defeated at the [[U.S. presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]]. [[Al Smith]] was supported by some city bosses, but had lost control of the New York Democratic party to Roosevelt. Roosevelt built his own national coalition with personal allies such as newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]], Irish leader [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], and California leader [[William G. McAdoo]]. When [[Texas]] leader John Nance Garner switched to FDR, he was given the vice presidential nomination.

The election campaign was conducted under the shadow of the Great Depression, and the new alliances created by the Depression. Roosevelt and the Democratic Party mobilized the expanded ranks of the poor as well as organized labor, ethnic minorities, urbanites, and Southern whites, crafting the New Deal coalition. During the campaign, Roosevelt said: "I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people", coining a slogan that was later adopted for his legislative program as well as his new coalition. <ref>''Great Speeches'', Franklin D Roosevelt (1999) at 17.</ref>  

Economist Marriner Eccles observed that "given later developments, the campaign speeches often read like a giant misprint, in which Roosevelt and Hoover speak each other's lines." <ref>Kennedy, 102.</ref> Roosevelt campaigned on the Democratic platform advocating "immediate and drastic reductions of all public expenditures," "abolishing useless commissions and offices, consolidating bureaus and eliminating extravagances reductions in bureaucracy," and for a "sound currency to be maintained at all hazards."<ref>Garret, Garet. Saturday Evening Post, 1938. Likewise, toward the end of his campaign he called to "Stop the deficits!" and said, "Before any man enters my cabinet he must give me a twofold pledge: absolute loyalty to the Democratic platform and especially to its economy plank." Flynn, John T. ''The Roosevelt Myth''</ref> In a criticism of Hoover, Roosevelt said, "I accuse the President of being the greatest spending administration in peace time in all American history&mdash;one which piled bureau on bureau, commission on commission<U+2026> We are spending altogether too much money for government services which are neither practical or necessary." <ref>''The Exemplary Presidency: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the American Political Tradition'', Philip Abbott (1990) at 20.  He said in a radio address, "Let us have the courage to stop borrowing to meet continuing deficits...Revenues must cover expenditures by one means or another. Any government, like any family, can, for a year, spend a little more than it earns. But you know and I know that a continuation of that habit means the poorhouse." Gordon, John Steele. [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1995/7/1995_7_82.shtml ''The Federal Debt''], American Heritage Magazine, November 1995, Volume 46, Issue 7. 
On [[September 23]], Roosevelt made the gloomy evaluation that, "Our industrial plant is built; the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt. Our last frontier has long since been reached." ''Great Speeches'', Franklin D Roosevelt (1999).</ref> Hoover damned that pessimism as a denial of "the promise of American life . . . the counsel of despair." <ref>More: The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America, Collins (2002) at 5.</ref> On [[October 19]], Roosevelt attacked Hoover's deficits and called for sharp reductions in government spending. The prohibition issue solidified the wet vote for Roosevelt, who noted that repeal would bring in new tax revenues. 

Roosevelt won 57% of the vote and carried all but six states. After the election, Roosevelt refused Hoover's requests for a meeting to come up with a joint program to stop the downward spiral. In February 1933, an assassin, [[Giuseppe Zangara]], fired five shots at Roosevelt, missing him but killing the [[Chicago]] Mayor [[Anton Cermak]].

==First term, 1933-1937==
{{see also|New Deal}}

When Roosevelt was inaugurated in March 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history. A quarter of the workforce was unemployed. Farmers were in deep trouble as prices fell by 60%. Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929. In a country with limited government social services outside the cities, two million were homeless. The banking system had collapsed completely. Historians later categorized Roosevelt's program as "relief, recovery and reform." <ref>"The United States: 1900-1945" in ''The Oxford History of the Twentieth Century'', W Roger Louis (2006).</ref>

Relief was urgently needed by tens of millions of unemployed. Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal. Reform meant long-term fixes of what was wrong, especially with the financial and banking systems. Roosevelt's series of [[radio]] speeches, known as [[Fireside chats|Fireside Chats]], presented his proposals directly to the American public.

===First New Deal, 1933-1934===

Roosevelt's "[[New Deal#The First Hundred Days|First 100 Days]]" concentrated on the first part of his strategy: immediate relief. From [[March 9]] to [[June 16]], [[1933]], Franklin D. Roosevelt sent Congress a record number of bills, all of which passed easily.  To propose programs, Roosevelt relied on leading Senators such as [[George Norris]], [[Robert F. Wagner]] and [[Hugo Black]], as well as his own [[Brain Trust]] of academic advisers. Like Hoover, he saw the Depression as partly a matter of confidence, caused in part by people no longer spending or investing because they were afraid to do so. He therefore set out to restore confidence through a series of dramatic gestures.

FDR's natural air of [[confidence]] and [[optimism]] did much to reassure the nation.{{cite needed}} His inauguration on [[March 4]], [[1933]], occurred in the middle of a bank panic,  hence the backdrop for his famous words: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." <ref>See the text of the address at Wikisource.[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Franklin_Roosevelt%27s_first_inaugural_address].</ref> The very next day he announced a plan to allow banks to reopen, which they largely did by the end of the month.  This was his first proposed step to recovery. 

[[Image:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Dorothea Lange]]'s ''Migrant Mother'' depicts destitute pea pickers during the depression in California, centering on [[Florence Owens Thompson]], a mother of seven children, age 32, March 1936.]]
* Relief measures included the continuation of Hoover's major relief program for the unemployed under the new name, [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]]. The most popular of all New Deal agencies, and Roosevelt's favorite, was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed young men to work on rural local projects. Congress also gave the [[Federal Trade Commission]] broad new regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt expanded reliance on a Hoover agency, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]].  Roosevelt made [[agriculture]] relief a high priority and set up the first [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA). The AAA tried to force higher prices for commodities by paying farmers to take land out of crops and to cut herds.

* Reform of the economy was the goal of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) of [[1933]]. It tried to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to come up with codes that established the rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such a minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Firms and workers negotiated the codes which were then presented for approval by Roosevelt. Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval. Provisions encouraged unions and suspended [[anti-trust]] laws. The NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the U.S. Supreme Court on [[May 27]], [[1935]]. Roosevelt opposed the decision, saying "The fundamental purposes and principles of the NIRA are sound. To abandon them is unthinkable. It would spell the return to industrial and labor chaos."<ref name="Cole">Cole, Harold L and Ohanian, Lee E. [http://www.economics.hawaii.edu/research/seminars/02-03/02-21.pdf ''New Deal Policies and the Persistence of the Great <3 Depression: A General Equilibrium Analysis''], 2004.</ref> In [[1933]] major new banking restrictions were passed and in 1934 the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] was created to regulate Wall Street, with 1932 campaign fund raiser [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] in charge.  

* Recovery was pursued through "pump-priming" (that is, federal spending). The NIRA included $3.3 billion of spending through the [[Public Works Administration]] to stimulate the economy, which was to be handled by Interior Secretary [[Harold Ickes]]. Roosevelt worked with Republican Senator [[George Norris]] to create the largest government-owned industrial enterprise in American history, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken [[Tennessee Valley]]. The repeal of [[prohibition]] also brought in new tax revenues and helped him keep a major campaign promise.

Roosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the regular federal budget, including 40% cuts to veterans' benefits and cuts in overall military spending. He removed 500,000 veterans and widows from the pension rolls and slashed benefits for the remainder. Protests erupted, led by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]].  Roosevelt held his ground, but when the angry veterans formed a coalition with Senator [[Huey Long]] and passed a huge bonus bill over his veto, he was defeated.  He succeeded in cutting federal salaries and the military and naval budgets.  He reduced spending on research and education&mdash;there was no New Deal for science until World War II began.

<U+03BC>===Second New Deal, 1935-1936===
[[Image:Dust Storm Texas 1935.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Dust storms were frequent during the depression; this one occurred in Texas in 1935.]]After the 1934 Congressional elections, which gave Roosevelt large majorities in both houses, there was a fresh surge of New Deal legislation. These measures included the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) which set up a national relief agency that employed two million family heads. However, even at the height of WPA employment in 1938, unemployment was still 12.5% according to figures from Micheal Darby.<ref>Darby, Michael R.''Three and a half million U.S. Employees have been mislaid: or, an Explanation of Unemployment, 1934-1941.'' Journal of Political Economy 84, no. 1 (1976): 1-16.</ref>The [[Social Security Act]], established [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor and the sick. Senator [[Robert F. Wagner|Robert Wagner]] wrote the [[Wagner Act]], which officially became the [[National Labor Relations Act]]. The act established the federal rights of workers to organize unions, to engage in [[collective bargaining]], and to take part in strikes.

While the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by Al Smith, fought back with the [[American Liberty League]], but it failed to mobilize much grass roots support. By contrast, the labor unions, energized by the Wagner Act, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt's reelections in 1936, 1940 and 1944. <ref>Leuchtenberg 1963 </ref>

===Economic environment===
''See also: [[Unemployment#New_Deal_in_USA.2C_1933-40|Unemployment and the New Deal]] and [[Great Depression in the United States#Effects|Effects of the Great Depression]]'' 

Government spending increased from 8.0% of gross national product (GNP) under [[Herbert Hoover#Economy|Hoover]] in 1932 to 10.2% of the GNP in 1936. Because of the depression, the [[national debt]] as a percentage of the GNP had doubled under Hoover from 16% to 33.6% of the GNP in 1932. While Roosevelt balanced the "regular" budget, the emergency budget was funded by debt, which increased to 40.9% in 1936, and then remained level until World War II, at which time it escalated rapidly.   <ref>''Historical Statistics'' (1976) series Y457, Y493, F32.  The increase in debt during the depression and World War II are shown on the chart below. [[Image:Debt1929-50.jpg|thumb|275px|left|National debt from four years before Roosevelt took office to five years after the time that he died in office.]]</ref>

Deficit spending had been recommended by some economists, most notably by [[John Maynard Keynes]] of Britain.  Some economists in retrospect have argued that the [[National Labor Relations Act]] and [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] were ineffective policies because they relied on price fixing. <ref>Parker.</ref> The GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. That is, the economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of peacetime, and then grew 56% from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of wartime. However, the economic recovery did not absorb all the unemployment Roosevelt inherited. In his first term, unemployment fell by two-thirds from 25% when he took office to 9.1% in 1937 but then stayed high until it vanished during the war. <ref>Smiley 1983.</ref>  

During the war, the economy operated under such different conditions that comparison is impossible with peacetime.  However, Roosevelt saw the New Deal policies as central to his legacy, and in his 1944 State of the Union speech, he advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a [[Second Bill of Rights]].

The [[Economy of the United States|U.S. economy]] grew rapidly during Roosevelt's term. <ref>''Historical Stats. U.S.'' (1976) series F31</ref> However, coming out of the depression, this growth was accompanied by continuing high levels of [[Unemployment_rate#New_Deal_in_USA.2C_1933-40|unemployment]]; as the median joblessness rate during the New Deal was 17.2 percent. Throughout his entire term, including the war years, average unemployment was 13%. <ref>''Historical Statistics US'' (1976) series D-86; Smiley 1983</ref> <ref>Smiley, Gene, "Recent Unemployment Rate Estimates for the 1920s and 1930s," Journal of Economic History, June 1983, 43, 487-93.</ref>  Total employment during Roosevelt's term expanded by 18.31 million jobs, with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5.3%. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://graphics7.nytimes.com/images/2003/07/02/business/03JOBSch450.gif |publisher=The New York Times |title=Presidents and job growth |accessdate=2006-05-20}}</ref>

Roosevelt's administration also saw significant changes to the [[income tax]] in the American tax system. Just [[Herbert Hoover#Economy|prior]] to Roosevelt's election in 1932, Congress passed the [[Revenue Act of 1932]], increasing the top [[marginal tax rate]] on individual income from 25% to 63% and enacting a wide range of additional excise taxes.  In 1936, the Roosevelt administration added a higher top rate of 79% on individual income greater than $5 million, and that rate was increased again in 1939. During World War II, the top [[marginal tax rate]] was moved up to 91%. More significantly for most Americans, the overall rate structure was heavily compressed in 1943, with the highest rate made applicable to individuals with income of $200,000 or more, and withholding taxes were introduced.<ref>''United States Internal Revenue Code'', 26 USC <U+0260> 1, Legislative History.</ref>

===Foreign policy===
The rejection of the [[League of Nations]] treaty in 1919 marked the dominance of [[isolationism]] from world organizations in American foreign policy. Despite Roosevelt's Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the [[Good Neighbor Policy]], which was a re-evaluation of American policy towards [[Latin America]]. Since the [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, this area had been seen as an American [[sphere of influence]]. American forces were withdrawn from [[Haiti]], and new treaties with [[Cuba]] and [[Panama]] ended their status as American [[protectorate]]s. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the [[Montevideo Convention]] on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries.

==Second term, 1937-1941==
[[Image:FDR0415.JPG|right|frame|Roosevelt's ebullient public personality helped bolster the nation's confidence.]]

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|1936 presidential election]], Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs against [[Kansas]] Governor [[Alfred Landon]], who accepted much of the New Deal but objected that it was hostile to business and involved too much waste. Roosevelt and Garner won 61% of the vote and carried every state except [[Maine]] and [[Vermont]]. The New Deal Democrats won even larger majorities in Congress. Roosevelt was backed by a coalition of voters which included traditional Democrats across the country, small farmers, the "[[Solid South]]", [[Catholicism|Catholics]], [[Political machine|big city machines]], [[Labor unions in the United States#Labor History 1932-1955|labor unions]], northern [[African-American]]s, [[Jews]], [[intellectuals]] and [[American liberalism|political liberals]]. This coalition, frequently referred to as the New Deal coalition, remained largely intact for the Democratic Party until the 1960s.

In dramatic contrast to the first term, very little major legislation was passed in the second term. There was a [[United States Housing Authority]] (1937), a second Agricultural Adjustment Act and the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) of 1938, which created the [[minimum wage]]. When the economy began to deteriorate again in late 1937, Roosevelt responded with an aggressive program of stimulation, asking Congress for $5 billion for WPA relief and public works. This managed to eventually create a peak of 3.3 million WPA jobs by 1938, but unemployment was still 12.5%.

The Supreme Court was the main obstacle to Roosevelt's programs during his first term. In 1935, the Court ruled that the [[National Recovery Act]] was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the President. It also ruled that some other pieces of New Deal legislation were [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]]. In addition, the Court reversed the President<U+2019>s dismissal of William E. Humphrey from the Federal Trade Commission. The decision on Humphrey "is said to have nettled the President more than any other, but when he held a lengthy press conference and denounced the Supreme Court for taking the country back to a "horse-and-buggy" concept of interstate commerce it was the NRA decision that he had in mind." Roosevelt proposed a "persistent infusion of new blood" by enlarging the Court so that he could appoint more sympathetic judges.<ref>Pusey, Merlo J. [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1958/3/1958_3_24.shtml ''F.D.R. vs. the Supreme Court''], American Heritage Magazine, April 1958,Volume 9, Issue 3</ref> This "[[court packing]]" plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party, since it seemed to upset the [[separation of powers]] which is one of the cornerstones of the American constitutional structure. Roosevelt was forced to abandon the plan, but the Court also drew back from confrontation with the administration by finding the Labor Relations Act and the Social Security Act to be constitutional. Deaths and retirements on the Supreme Court soon allowed Roosevelt to make his own appointments to the bench. Between 1937 and 1941, he appointed eight justices to the court.

Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress (mostly from the South), Roosevelt involved himself in the 1938 Democratic primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform. His targets denounced Roosevelt for trying to take over the Democratic party and used the argument that they were independent to win reelection. Roosevelt only defeated one target: a conservative Democrat from New York City.  The Southern Congressmen forged a Conservative coalition with congressional Republicans, virtually ending Roosevelt's ability to get his domestic proposals enacted into law.  The minimum wage law of 1938 was the last substantial New Deal reform act passed by Congress.  

The rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany aroused fears of a new world war. In 1935, at the time of Italy's invasion of [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Abyssinia]], Congress passed the [[Neutrality Act]], applying a mandatory ban on the shipment of arms from the U.S. to any combatant nation. Roosevelt opposed the act on the grounds that it penalized the victims of aggression such as Abyssinia, and that it restricted his right as President to assist friendly countries, but public support was overwhelming so he signed it. In 1937, Congress passed an even more stringent act, but when the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, public opinion favored China, and Roosevelt found various ways to assist [[China]]. 

In October 1937, he gave the [[Quarantine Speech]] aiming to contain aggressor nations. He proposed that warmongering states be treated as a public health menace and be "quarantined." <ref> See Quarntine speech on wikisource[http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Quarantine_Speech].</ref>Meanwhile he secretly stepped up a program to build long range submarines that could blockade Japan. When [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, Roosevelt rejected the Wilsonian neutrality stance and sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily. He began a regular secret correspondence with Winston Churchill discussing ways of supporting Britain.

Roosevelt turned to [[Harry Hopkins]] for foreign policy advice, who became his chief wartime advisor. They sought innovative ways to help Britain, whose financial resources were exhausted by the end of 1940. Congress, where isolationist sentiment was in retreat, passed the [[Lend-Lease Act]] in March 1941, allowing America to "lend" huge amounts of military equipment in return for "leases" on British naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I, there would be no repayment after the war.  Roosevelt was a lifelong free trader and anti-imperialist, and ending European [[colonialism]] was one of his objectives. Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill, who became British [[Prime Minister]] in May 1940.

In May 1940, a stunning German [[blitzkrieg]] overran Denmark, Norway, the Low countries and France, leaving Britain vulnerable to invasion. Roosevelt, who was determined to defend Britain, took advantage of the rapid shifts of public opinion. A consensus was clear that military spending had to be dramatically expanded. There was no consensus on how much the U.S. should risk war in helping Britain. FDR appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, [[Henry L. Stimson]] and [[Frank Knox]], as Secretaries of War and the Navy respectively. The fall of Paris shocked American opinion, and isolationist sentiment declined. Both parties gave support to his plans to rapidly build up the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany.  He successfully urged Congress to enact the first [[Selective Service Act|peacetime draft]] in United States history in 1940 (it was renewed in 1941 by one vote in Congress). Roosevelt was supported by the [[Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies]], and opposed by the [[America First Committee]].

Roosevelt used his personal charisma to build support for intervention.  America should be the "[[Arsenal of Democracy]]," he told his fireside audience.<ref>[[s:Roosevelt's Fireside Chat, 29 December 1940|Full text of the speech]] from Wikisource.</ref> In August, Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts with the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], which gave 50 American [[destroyer]]s to the Britain in exchange for base rights in the British Caribbean islands. This was a precursor of the March 1941 Lend-Lease agreement which began to direct massive military and economic aid to Britain, China and Russia.

==Third term, 1941-1945==
The two-term tradition had been an unwritten rule since [[George Washington]] declined to run for a third term in the 1790s, but Roosevelt, after blocking the presidential ambitions of cabinet members [[James Farley|Jim Farley]] and [[Cordell Hull]], decided to run for a third term. In his campaign against Republican [[Wendell Willkie]], Roosevelt stressed both his proven leadership experience and his intention to do everything possible to keep the United States out of war. Roosevelt won the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 election]] with 55% of the popular vote and 38 of the 48 states. A shift to the left within the Administration was shown by the naming of [[Henry A. Wallace]] as Vice President in place of the conservative Texan [[John Nance Garner]], who had become a bitter enemy of Roosevelt after 1937.

[[Image:Prince of Wales-5.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Roosevelt and Winston Churchill meet at Argentia, Newfoundland aboard HMS ''Prince of Wales'' during their 1941 secret meeting to develop the Atlantic Charter.]]Roosevelt's third term was dominated by [[World War II]], in Europe and in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. Roosevelt slowly began re-armament in 1938 since he was facing strong isolationist sentiment from leaders like Senators [[William Borah]] and [[Robert Taft]] who supported re-armament. By 1940, it was in high gear, with bipartisan support, partly to expand and re-equip the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] and partly to become the "Arsenal of Democracy" supporting Britain, France, China and (after June 1941), the Soviet Union. As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against the [[Axis Powers]], American isolationists&mdash;including [[Charles Lindbergh]] and [[America First]]&mdash;attacked the President as an irresponsible warmonger. Unfazed by these criticisms and confident in the wisdom of his foreign policy initiatives, FDR continued his twin policies of preparedness and aid to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] coalition. On [[December 29]], [[1940]], he delivered his Arsenal of Democracy fireside chat, in which he made the case for involvement directly to the American people, and a week later he delivered his famous [[Four Freedoms]] speech in January 1941, further laying out the case for an American defense of basic rights throughout the world.

The military buildup caused nationwide prosperity. By 1941, unemployment had fallen to under 1 million. There was a growing labor shortage in all the nation's major manufacturing centers, accelerating the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African-American workers from the Southern states, and of underemployed farmers and workers from all rural areas and small towns. The homefront was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concerns.

When Germany invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941, Roosevelt extended Lend-Lease to the Soviets. During 1941, Roosevelt also agreed that the U.S. Navy would escort Allied convoys as far east as [[Iceland]] and would fire upon German ships or submarines if they attacked Allied shipping within the U.S. Navy zone. Moreover, by 1941, U.S. Navy aircraft carriers were secretly ferrying British fighter planes between the UK and the Mediterranean war zones, and the British Royal Navy was receiving supply and repair assistance at American naval bases in the United States.

Thus by mid-1941 Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the Allied side with a policy of "all aid short of war."<ref>Churchill, ''The Grand Alliance'' (1977) at 119.</ref> Roosevelt met with Churchill on [[August 14]], [[1941]], to develop the [[Atlantic Charter]] in what was to be the first of several [[List of World War II conferences|wartime conferences]].

===Pearl Harbor===
{{see also2|Attack on Pearl Harbor|Europe first}}
[[Image:Franklin Roosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan December 1941.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Roosevelt signing the declaration of war against Japan, December 1941.]]
Roosevelt tried to keep Japan out of the war. After Japan occupied northern [[French Indo-China]] in late 1940, he authorized increased aid to China. In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of Indo-China, he cut off the sales of oil. Japan thus lost over 95% of its oil supply. Roosevelt continued negotiations with the Japanese government in the hope of averting war. Meanwhile he started shifting the long-range B-17 bomber force to the [[Philippines]], where it could threaten fire-bombing Japanese cities.

On [[December 7]], [[1941]], the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor]], damaging most of it and killing 3,000 American personnel. The Japanese took advantage of their preemptive destruction of most of the Pacific Fleet to rapidly occupy the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], taking [[Singapore]] in February 1942 and advancing through [[Burma]] to the borders of [[British India]] by May, cutting off the overland supply route to China. Antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight and the country united behind Roosevelt. 

Despite the wave of anger that swept across the U.S. in the wake of Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt decided from the start that the defeat of Nazi Germany had to take priority. Germany declared war against the U.S. on [[December 11]], [[1941]], which removed any meaningful opposition to the [[Europe first]] strategy championed by Churchill and supported by Roosevelt.<ref>''Churchill and Roosevelt at War: The War They Fought and the Peace They Hoped to Make'', Sainsbury.</ref> The War Powers Act was passed on [[December 18]], [[1941]].<ref>The First War Powers act specifically authorized the censoring of international communications and  on [[December 19]], Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8985, which established the [[Office of Censorship]] and conferred on its director the power to censor international communications.</ref>Roosevelt met with Churchill in late December and planned a broad informal alliance between the U.S., Britain, China and the Soviet Union, with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts; and saving China and defeating Japan.

===War strategy===
{{see also|Origins of the Cold War}}
[[Image:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Chiang Kai-shek]] of China, Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in 1943]]

The "[[Big Three]]" (Roosevelt, Churchill, and [[Joseph Stalin]]), together with [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Charles de Gaulle]], oversaw an alliance in which British, American and French troops concentrated in the West, Russian troops fought on the [[Eastern front]], and Chinese, British and American troops fought in the [[Pacific theatre]].  The [[Allies]] formulated strategy in a series of high profile conferences as well as contact through diplomatic and military channels.

The U.S. took the view that the quickest way to defeat Germany was to open a western front in France across the [[English Channel]]. Churchill, wary of the casualties he feared this would entail, favored a more indirect approach, advancing northwards from the [[Mediterranean]], where the Allies were in control by early 1943, into either Italy or [[Greece]], and then into central Europe. Churchill also saw this as a way of blocking the Soviet Union's advance into east and central Europe, a political issue which Roosevelt and his commanders refused to take into account. Stalin advocated opening a Western front at the earliest possible time, as the bulk of the battles in 1942 and 1943 were fought on Russian soil or in the Pacific theatre.

As long as the British were providing most of the troops, aircraft and ships against the Germans, Roosevelt felt he had to accept Churchill's idea that a launch across the [[English Channel]] would have to wait. The Allies undertook the invasions of French [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] ([[Operation Torch]]) in November 1942, of [[Sicily]] ([[Operation Husky]]) in July 1943, and of Italy ([[Operation Avalanche]]) in September 1943. This entailed postponing the cross-channel invasion from 1943 to 1944. [[Operation Overlord]] finally took place in June 1944. Although most of France was quickly liberated, the Allies were blocked on the German border in the "[[Battle of the Bulge]]" in December 1944, and final victory over Germany was not achieved until May 1945, by which time the Soviet Union had occupied eastern and central Europe as far west as the [[Elbe River]] in central Germany.

[[Image:Azizfdr.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia]] and FDR at Cairo, 1945; FDR promised American friendship]]

Meanwhile, in the Pacific, the Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when Japan sustained a major naval defeat at the hands of the U.S. at the [[Battle of Midway]]. The Japanese advance to the south and south-east was halted at the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942 and the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] between August 1942 and February 1943. The U.S. then began a slow and costly progress through the Pacific islands, with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic air power could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. This did not prove necessary, because the almost simultaneous declaration of war on Japan by the Soviet Union and the use of the [[atomic bomb]] on Japanese cities brought about Japan's surrender in September 1945.

===Post-war planning===
By late 1943, it was apparent that the Allies would ultimately defeat Nazi Germany, and it became increasingly important to make high-level political decisions about the course of the war and the postwar future of Europe. Roosevelt met with Churchill and the Chinese leader [[Chiang Kai-shek]] at the [[Cairo Conference]] in November 1943, and then went to [[Tehran]] to confer with Churchill and Stalin. At the [[Tehran Conference]], Roosevelt and Churchill told Stalin about the plan to invade France in 1944, and Roosevelt also discussed his plans for a postwar international organization. Stalin was pleased that the western Allies had abandoned any idea of moving into the [[Balkans]] or central Europe via Italy, and he went along with Roosevelt's plan for the [[United Nations]]. Stalin also agreed that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan when Germany was defeated. At this time, Churchill and Roosevelt were acutely aware of the huge and disproportionate sacrifices the Soviets were making on the eastern front while their invasion of France was still six months away, so they did not raise awkward political issues which did not require immediate solutions, such as the future of Germany and Eastern Europe.

[[Image:Yalta Conference.jpg|300px|thumb|The "Big Three" Allied leaders at Yalta: Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin]]
By the beginning of 1945, however, with the Allied armies advancing into Germany, consideration of these issues could not be put off. In February, Roosevelt, despite his steadily deteriorating health, traveled to [[Yalta]], in the Soviet [[Crimea]], to meet again with Stalin and Churchill. This meeting, the [[Yalta Conference]], is often portrayed as a decisive turning point in modern history, though most of the decisions made there recognized realities which had already been established by force of arms. The decision of the western Allies to delay the invasion of France from 1943 to 1944 had allowed the Soviet Union to occupy all of eastern Europe, including [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], as well as eastern Germany. Since Stalin was in full control of these areas, there was little Roosevelt and Churchill could do to prevent him imposing his will on them, as he was rapidly doing by establishing [[Communist]]-controlled governments in all these countries.

Roosevelt was not interested in arguing with Stalin over Poland for two reasons. The first was that he believed that Soviet support was essential for the projected invasion of Japan, in which the Allies ran the risk of huge casualties. He feared that if Stalin was provoked over Poland he might renege on his Tehran commitment to enter the war against Japan. The second was that he saw the United Nations as the ultimate solution to all postwar problems, and he feared the United Nations project would fail without Soviet cooperation.

==Fourth term and death, 1945==
Although Roosevelt was only 62 in 1944, his health had been in decline since at least 1940. The strain of his paralysis and the physical exertion needed to compensate for it for over 20 years had taken their toll, as had many years of stress and a lifetime of chain-smoking. He had been diagnosed with [[high blood pressure]] and long-term [[heart disease]] and was advised to modify his diet (although not to stop smoking). Aware of the risk that Roosevelt would die during his fourth term, the party regulars insisted that [[Henry A. Wallace]], who was seen as too pro-Soviet, be dropped as Vice President. Roosevelt replaced Wallace with the little known Senator [[Harry S. Truman]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944 elections]], Roosevelt and Truman won 53% of the vote and carried 36 states, against New York Governor [[Thomas Dewey]].

After the Yalta conference in February 1945, relations between the western Allies and Stalin deteriorated rapidly, and so did Roosevelt's health. When he addressed Congress on his return from Yalta, many were shocked to see how old, thin and sick he looked. He spoke from his wheelchair, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity. But mentally he was still in full command. "The Crimean Conference," he said firmly, "ought to spell the end of a system of unilateral action, the exclusive alliances, the spheres of influence, the balances of power, and all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries &mdash; and have always failed. We propose to substitute for all these, a universal organization in which all peace-loving nations will finally have a chance to join." <ref>''Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932-1945'', Robert Dallek (1995) at 520. </ref>

[[Image:Franklin Roosevelt funeral procession 1945.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Roosevelt's funeral procession.]]During March and early April 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, [[prisoners of war]] and other issues. When Stalin accused the western Allies of plotting a separate peace with Hitler behind his back, Roosevelt replied: "I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates."<ref>''War in Italy 1943-1945'', Richard Lamb (1996) at 287.</ref>

On [[March 30]], [[1945]], Roosevelt went to Warm Springs to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the morning of [[April 12]], [[1945]], he complained of a sudden headache, then slumped forward in his chair and lost consciousness. The doctor diagnosed that he had suffered a massive [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. 

Roosevelt's death was greeted with shock and grief across the U.S. and around the world. At a time when the press did not pry into the health or private lives of presidents, his declining health had not been known to the general public. Roosevelt had been President for more than 12 years, longer than any other person, and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the defeat of Nazi Germany and to within sight of the defeat of Japan as well. 

Less than a month later, on [[May 8]], [[1945]], came the moment Roosevelt fought for: [[V-E Day]]. President Harry Truman dedicated V-E Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory, paying tribute to his commitment towards ending the war in Europe.

[[Image:FDR Memorial wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The Four Freedoms engraved on a wall at the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in Washington.]]Both during and after his terms, [[Criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt|critics of Roosevelt]] questioned not only [[Critics of the New Deal|his policies and positions]], but also the consolidation of power that occurred because of his lengthy tenure as President, his service during two major crises, and his enormous popularity.  The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during Roosevelt's term redefined the role the government in the United States, and Roosevelt's advocacy of government social programs was instrumental in redefining [[liberalism]] for coming generations.<ref>[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.|Schlesinger, Arthur Jr]], [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans] from ''The Politics of Hope'', Riverside Press, Boston, 1962.</ref>

Roosevelt firmly established the United States' leadership role on the world stage, with pronouncements such as his [[Four freedoms]] speech forming a basis for the active role of the United States in the [[Cold War]] and beyond.  The decisions made at the Yalta Conference established international alliances and boundaries that continue to affect world diplomacy today.  

[[Franklin D. Roosevelt's record on civil rights]] has been the subject of much controversy.  Roosevelt needed the support of Southern Democrats for his New Deal programs, and taking an aggressive position on [[civil rights]] could have threatened his ability to pass his highest priority programs.  In addition, Roosevelt participated in the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and has been charged with not acting quickly or decisively enough to prevent or stop the [[Holocaust]].

After his death, Eleanor Roosevelt continued to be a forceful presence in American and world politics, serving as [[ambassador]] to the United Nations and championing civil rights.  Many members of his administration played leading roles in the administrations of Truman, [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], each of whom embraced Roosevelt's political legacy.{{cite needed}}

Roosevelt's [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|home in Hyde Park]] is now a [[National historic site]] and home to his [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum|Presidential library]].  His [[Little White House|retreat]] at Warm Springs, Georgia is a museum operated by the state of Georgia. The [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial|Roosevelt memorial]] has been established in Washington, D.C. next to the [[Jefferson Memorial]] on the [[Tidal Basin]], and his image appears on the [[Roosevelt dime]]. Many parks, schools, roads, an [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|aircraft carrier]] and a [[Franklin D. Roosevelt (Paris Metro)|Paris Metro stop]] have been named in his honor.
