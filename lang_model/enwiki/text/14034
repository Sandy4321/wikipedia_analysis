'''Ari Marmell''' (born March 22, 1974) is an American novelist and freelance [[role-playing game]] writer.

==Novels==
His first novel, ''Gehenna: The Final Night'', was published in 2004 by [[White Wolf Publishing]]. ''Agents of Artifice,'' a media tie-in novel set in the [[Magic: The Gathering]] Planeswalkers game-setting, and published by Wizards of the Coast, followed in November 2009.

His first novel that was not based on a role-playing game was 2010's ''The Conqueror's Shadow''. Reviewing the novel for ''[[Booklist]]'', Krista Hutley wrote, "This action-packed, morally gray fantasy has an intriguingly twisty plot, full of magic and political intrigue."<ref>Hutley, Krista (February 1, 2010). "The Conqueror's Shadow", ''[[Booklist]]'' '''106''' (11): 36.</ref> Reviewer Clay Kallam wrote that it "has a lot going for it, but it still didn't leave me completely satisfied."<ref>Kallam, Clay (July 4, 2010). "Worlds Beyond", ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''.</ref> The sequel to ''The Conqueror's Shadow'' is 2011's ''The Warlord's Legacy''.<ref>Kallam, Clay (May 1, 2011). "Aaronovitch delivers London, Froth and Magic", ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'', p. D7.</ref> ''[[Library Journal]]'' wrote that it "fills a vital niche in the fantasy adventurer genre, one occupied by the heroes of Michael Moorcock's [[Elric of Melnibon<U+00E9>|Elric Melnibon<U+00E9>]] novels and C.S. Friedman's ''[[Coldfire Trilogy]]''."<ref>Cassada, Jackie (February 15, 2011). "SF/Fantasy", ''[[Library Journal]]'' '''136''' (3).</ref>

In 2011, Marmell's novel, ''The Goblin Corps'' was published by Pyr. The Goblin Corps drew interest not only for Marmell's talented writing, but also for the fact that, unlike many fantasy novels, it followed the story from the perspective of the traditional "bad guys": the goblins themselves.

In February 2012, Pyr is also scheduled to release Marmell's ''Thief's Covenant'', first in his "Widdershins Adventure" Young Adult series.<ref name="TC at Amazon.com">[http://www.amazon.com/Thiefs-Covenant-Widdershins-Ari-Marmell/dp/1616145471/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1315631710&sr=1-1]</ref> ''Thief's Covenant'' will be followed by ''False Covenant'', the second "Widdershins Adventure" novel.

On February 1, 2012, it was revealed Marmell would also pen a novel set in the Darksiders universe. Darksiders is a video game series published by THQ and developed by Vigil Games. It was created by comic-book artist, Joe Madureira. The novel is titled "Darksiders: The Abomination Vault" and will be published by Random House Publishing Group. The novel will ship at the same time as the game, in June, 2012.<ref>[http://www.ausgamers.com/news/read/3170063/ Farrelly, Stephen (February 1, 2012)]</ref>

==Role-playing games==

"Toreador/Gehenna: The Final Night/The Puppet-Masters: SF, Fantasy & Horror's Monthly Trade Journal", ''[[DNA Publications|Chronicle]]'' '''26''' (5): 46.</ref> and [[Wizards of the Coast]]. ''Iggwilv<U+2019>s Legacy'' was his first opportunity to revisit one of the old classics (a few references to the [[The Keep on the Borderlands|Caves of Chaos]] he squeezed into ''Frostfell Rift'' notwithstanding).
