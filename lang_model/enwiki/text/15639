The '''black-spotted whipray''' (''Himantura astra'') is a [[species]] of [[Myliobatiformes|stingray]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Dasyatidae]], found in coastal waters off southern [[New Guinea]] and northern [[Australia]]. Long thought to be a [[polymorphism (biology)|variant]] of the related [[brown whipray]] (''H. toshi''), this species has an angular, diamond-shaped [[pectoral fin]] disc and a whip-like tail without fin folds. It is characterized by its dorsal color pattern, which consists of a variably extensive covering of small, close-set dark, and sometimes also white, spots on a grayish brown background. In addition, the tail has alternating light and dark saddles past the stinging spine. This species reaches a maximum recorded width of {{convert|80|cm|in|abbr=on}}.

[[Crustacean]]s are the main type of food consumed by the black-spotted whipray. It is [[aplacental viviparous]], with females [[gestation|gestating]] 1&ndash;3 young at a time, supplying them with histotroph ("[[uterus|uterine]] milk"). Most of the black-spotted whipray's range lies within Australian waters, where it faces minimal conservation threats since the widespread deployment of [[bycatch]]-reducing measures on commercial [[trawler]]s. It is caught in small numbers for meat, skin, and [[cartilage]] by [[Indonesia]]n fishers, as well as by [[prawn]] [[seine fishing|seine fisher]]s off [[Papua New Guinea]]. A 2004 assessment of the brown whipray by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), which also included data on the black-spotted whipray, listed them under [[Least Concern]].

==Taxonomy==
The black-spotted whipray was traditionally thought to be the same species as the [[brown whipray]] (''H. toshi'').<ref name="last et al"/> In 1994, [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) researchers Peter Last and John Stevens tentatively identified a spotted variant of ''H. toshi'' as "''Himantura'' sp. A". However, it was not until more specimens became available for study in the mid-2000s that the black-spotted whipray was confirmed as distinct, albeit closely related, species to ''H. toshi''. Last, Mabel Manjaji-Matsumoto, and John Pogonoski formally described it in a 2008 CSIRO publication, giving it the [[specific epithet]] ''astra'' after the [[Latin]] ''astrum'' ("[[constellation]]"). The [[type specimen]] is an adult male {{convert|59|cm|in|abbr=on}} across, collected from the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]].<ref name="last et al">{{cite book |author=Last, P.R., B.M.

Other [[common name]]s for the black-spotted whipray include coachwhip ray, Tosh's longtail ray, and wulura.<ref name="last and stevens"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-spotted whipray is found widely off northern [[Australia]] from [[Shark Bay]] in [[Western Australia]] and [[Moreton Bay]] in [[Queensland]], including the [[Timor Sea]], and is particularly abundant in the Gulf of Carpentaria. It has also been reported from off southern [[New Guinea]]. This [[benthic fish|bottom-dwelling]] species inhabits coastal waters {{convert|1|-|141|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, favoring sandy [[habitat]]s, and tends to be found farther from shore than the brown whipray. In Shark Bay, it is found in greater numbers during the warm season than the cold.<ref name="last and stevens">{{cite book |author=Last, P.R. and J.D.

==Description==
The black-spotted whipray can grow to {{convert|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} long; reports of rays {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more across are likely in error. It has a diamond-shaped, relatively thin [[pectoral fin]] disc approximately 1.1&ndash;1.2 times wider than long. The outer corners of the disc are fairly angular, and the leading margins are nearly straight. The snout is triangular and forms a broadly obtuse angle with a barely protruding, pointed tip. The eyes are small and immediately followed by larger, oval [[spiracle]]s. The long, slender nostrils have a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin between them; the posterior margin of the curtain is concave on either side and finely fringed. The mouth is strongly bow-shaped and bears a row of four papillae (nipple-like structures) across the floor. The small, blunt teeth number 41&ndash;49 rows in the upper jaw and 40&ndash;50 rows in the lower jaw.<ref name="last et al"/><ref name="last and stevens"/>

The [[pelvic fin]]s are small and somewhat narrow, with a curving posterior margin; males have stout [[clasper]]s. The very thin, gently tapering whip-like tail measures 2.1&ndash;2.7 times as long as the disc is wide, and lacks fin folds. One or two slender stinging spines are present atop the tail; many individuals have the sting missing. Behind the sting, there is a deep ventral groove and prominent lateral ridges running to the tip of the tail. The upper surface of the disc is densely covered by tiny heart-shaped [[dermal denticle]]s in a wide central band from between the eyes to entirely cover the tail, with those at the center of the disc are slightly larger and spear-shaped. Newborns lack denticles; the denticles on the "shoulders" and head are the first to develop. This species is grayish brown above, with many small dark spots covering all or part of the disc and tail base; sometimes there are also subtle to prominent white spots, that may be arranged into rosettes surrounding the dark spots or into indistinct rings ("pseudo-ocelli"). The tail past the sting bears alternating light and dark saddles; these form complete bands in juveniles under {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. The spots of rays under {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} across are proportionately larger and widely spaced. The upper half of the eyeball is spotted while the lower half is white. The disc and tail are plain white beneath.<ref name="last et al"/><ref name="last and stevens"/>

==Biology and ecology==
Over 90% of the black-spotted whipray's diet consists of [[crustacean]]s.<ref name="jacobsen">Jacobsen, I. (2007&ndash;10).

Females have a single functionary [[ovary]] and [[uterus]] (on the left), and produce litters of 1&ndash;3 pups. The newborns measure {{convert|17|-|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} across; both sexes [[sexual maturity|mature]] at about {{convert|46|-|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. The growth rate is relatively low, with females growing much more slowly than males.<ref name="last and stevens"/><ref name="jacobsen"/>

==Human interactions==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'s (IUCN) 2004 assessment of the brown whipray (which at the time also included the black-spotted whipray), listed it under [[Least Concern]]. Their range off northern Australia was noted to be large and relatively protected from fishing pressure, as the mandatory implementation of [[Turtle Exclusion Device]]s (TEDs) on [[bottom trawl]]s has greatly reduced [[bycatch]] mortality.<ref name="iucn">{{IUCN2010 |assessors=Manjaji, B.M. and W.T.
