'''Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto''' ([[Atlacomulco]], [[Estado de M<U+00E9>xico]], July 20, 1966) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician, member of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] ([[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]], PRI), and current governor of the [[State of Mexico]].  He was nominated as the PRI<U+2019>s candidate for the governorship of the State of Mexico for the term that spans from 2005 to 2011. Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto won the on elections on July 3, 2005 with a significant margin of the popular vote and has been governor since September 2005.

==Family Origins==

His father, Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a del Mazo (1937-2005), had a professional degree in electric engineering and worked as an employee for the Federal Electricity Commission. As such, he was a civil servant for the [[State of Mexico]] between 1975 and 1981. His mother, Maria del Socorro Nieto S<U+00E1>nchez, combined caring for her family with her profession as a school teacher. Together, they had 4 children: Enrique, Arturo, Ver<U+00F3>nica and Ana Cecilia. In 1977 the family left Atlacomulco and moved to [[Toluca]], Mexico State's capital. 

== Education==

During an interview published in ''Mexican Leaders'' magazine, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto relates how he participated in his first political exercises as a junior in high school when he served as  representative for his class during public ceremonies. However, his formal training and first incursions in state politics would wait until the end of his studies.<ref>

Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto moved to [[Mexico City]] in order to get his law degree from the [[Universidad Panamericana]]. After getting his degree and defending his thesis <U+201C>[[<U+00C1>lvaro Obreg<U+00F3>n]] and the Modern Presidential System<U+201D>, he taught law at his alma mater. In subsequent years he would go on to get his MBA at the [[Instituto Tecnol<U+00F3>gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey]] (1990-1995) and complement his studies with English language courses.

== Political beginnings ==

In May 1990 he became secretary of the Citizen Movement of Zone I of the State Directive Committee of the National Confederation of Popular Organizations (CNOP). A year later he participated as delegate to the Organization and Citizen Front in different municipalities of the [[Estado de M<U+00E9>xico]]. He also served as instructor at the Electoral Training Center of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]. During this time Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto also held administrative positions in the state government.  Between 1993 and 1998, during [[Emilio Chuayffet|Emilio Chuayfett]]<U+2019>s term as governor, he was chief of staff for the Secretary of economic development of the [[State of Mexico]].  His experience made him learn more about the problems and challenges of the most populous state in Mexico. At the end of this period he worked as deputy secretary of government for the State of Mexico (1999-2000).<ref>[http://www.estadodemexico.com.mx  Biograf<U+00ED>a de Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto en]</ref>

During the period between 2000 and 2002 Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto exercised different tasks for the state's administration: government administration secretary, president of the directive council for the Social Security Institute of the State of Mexico and its municipalities, president of the internal council of the Health Institute of the State of Mexico and vice-president for the State of Mexico<U+2019>s government board for the Integral Family Development System  (DIF). In the meantime he was individual member of the National Institute of Public Administration and member of the administrative council for different decentralized public agencies. 

At 27 years old, in 1993, he married M<U+00F3>nica Pretelini (1962-2007.) She held a B.A. in Art History and she attended several postgraduate courses in Human Development. 

Together they had three children: Paulina, Alejandro and Nicole. They were married for thirteen years until the death of M<U+00F3>nica Pretelini in 2007.

== Local council and his run for Mexico State<U+2019>s governorship ==

His work as a state functionary and within his party helped Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto build his political career and his subsequent move into electoral positions.  As a member of the PRI's National and State Political Council and delegate to the PRI's XVIII General Assembly in 2001, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto was nominated for the local representative spot for the XIII District in the LV Legislature and he won the election.

Between September 2003 and September 2004 he was named coordinator of the PRI's parliamentary group in the LV Legislature and as Chairman of the Board of Political Coordination of the local congress. According to the book Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto, Memory of a campaign<ref name="M<U+00E9>xico, Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto 2011">Comit<U+00E9> Directivo Estatal del Partido Revolucionario Institucional del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico, Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto, Memoria de Campa<U+00F1>a para Gobernador Constitucional del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico (2005-2011), 2005.</ref>, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto was able to get 92% of his initiatives approved unanimously.

On October 17, 2004, he officially began his participation in the PRI's internal nomination process for the governorship of the [[State of Mexico]].  The other candidates considered for the governorship were: Guillermo Gonz<U+00E1>lez Mart<U+00ED>nez, [[Oscar Gustavo C<U+00E1>rdenas Monroy|Gustavo C<U+00E1>rdenas Monroy]], Jaime V<U+00E1>zquez Castillo, Eduardo Bernal Mart<U+00ED>nez, Fernando Alberto Garc<U+00ED>a Cuevas, Cuauht<U+00E9>moc Garc<U+00ED>a Ortega, Isidro Pastor Medrano, Enrique Jacob Rocha, H<U+00E9>ctor Luna de la Vega and [[Carlos Hank Rhon]]. These pre-candidates took part in conferences, seminars, round tables, and tours, whittling the original list to only six candidates participating in the official nomination process. On January 14, 2005, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto was the last man standing. On February 12, 2005, with 15,000 sympathizers in attendance, he was sworn in as candidate for the PRI.<ref>[http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=56369&tabla=estados Rinde protesta el candidato del PRI a la gubernatura del estado de M<U+00E9>xico] ''El Universal'', 13 de febrero del 2005.</ref>

The [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] and the Green Party (Partido Verde Ecologista de M<U+00E9>xico, [[PVEM]]) established an alliance which they claimed was to defend mutual policies of sustainable development, ecology, employment and support for youth.  This alliance would nominate just one candidate. This coalition, dubbed <U+201C>Alliance for Mexico<U+201D> ([[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]-[[Partido Verde Ecologista de M<U+00E9>xico|PVEM]]), was approved by the Electoral Institute of the State of Mexico in March. On April 2, in [[Cuautitl<U+00E1>n Izcalli]], Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto was sworn in as candidate for the PVEM. On the 15th the general council of the Electoral Institute of the State of Mexico ([[IFE]]) approved his registration as candidate.<ref name="M<U+00E9>xico, Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto 2011"/>

During this time other political parties announced the names of their respective candidates. National Action Party and Convergence for democracy (Convergencia Democr<U+00E1>tica, CD) ([[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]]) -[[Convergencia]] united behind candidate [[Rub<U+00E9>n Mendoza Ayala]]. The Democratic Revolution Party [[Partido de la Revoluci<U+00F3>n Democr<U+00E1>tica|PRD]] and the Labor Party [[Partido del Trabajo|PT]] formed their own coalition <U+201C>United to win<U+201D> (Unidos para ganar) and nominated [[Yeidckol Polevnsky]]. All the candidates constructed their platform around the struggle against poverty since, according to the social development secretary, the [[State of Mexico]] was among the poorest entities of the Mexican Republic.

== The 2005 campaign and elections ==

During the first months of 2005 Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto held an intensive campaign with engagements and stumps in different municipalities of the State of Mexico. His political team stressed the electorate<U+2019>s demands of concrete commitments. This is the reason why his campaign was based on efficiency and achievements in different community sectors.  He assumed his promise to fulfill the people's demands in a straightforward and practical approach.  During the entire campaign Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto travelled to all 125 municipalities in the state.  During his tours he established mandate commitments in all areas of government. He offered a list of 617 actions in the regional (118), municipal (474) and state fields (16). Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto affirmed his absolute commitment to accomplish these actions through a notarized oath signed in [[Toluca]] on June 28, 2005. This ceremony took place during his campaign's closing event which took place in [[Ecatepec]]. The campaign, according to Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto, resulted in 1,040,266 directly contacted people, 400,688 handshakes, 13,078 traveled km and 130 massive events with different social sectors.<ref name="M<U+00E9>xico, Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto 2011"/>

In the election<U+2019>s eve, the [[State of Mexico]] had a strange environment due to a supposed interference of the federal government and President [[Vicente Fox]] in the process as well as his supposed interest to favor the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]] candidate. In an important declaration Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto considered that all political actors during the competition should have been subject to a political lawsuit by the electoral authority (Federal Electoral Institute|[[IFE]]) and to respect the citizen<U+2019>s verdict. 

Election day, Sunday July 3, 2005, went off without big setbacks. Exit polls indicated a large margin in favor of Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto and these tendencies were confirmed by the Preliminary Electoral Result Program (Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares, PREP) that same evening. The next day the PREP officially announced he had received 45.7% of votes.

Four days later the IIEM confirmed Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto<U+2019>s victory the period for the Electoral Tribunal of the State of Mexico (Tribunal Electoral del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico TEEM) to resolve electoral process disputes began. This process would last until July 31. During this period the candidate<U+2019>s family suffered a big loss. On July 25, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto's father, Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a del Mazo, died of a chronic heart condition at the age of 68.<ref>[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/07/26/033n2est.php Fallece el padre de Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto] ''La Jornada'', 25 de julio de 2005</ref> 

Two weeks later, on August 12, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto received the certificate which accredited him as the elected governor of the State of Mexico. The final count was 49% for the PRI, 25.11% the PRD and 25.6% the PAN.

== The first year of government ==

On September 15, 2005, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto was sworn in as constitutional governor of the State of Mexico at the Morelos theater in Toluca in front of a 5000 people, which included all the members of Parliament of the LV local Legislature. In an official announcement to all the sectors of the state he proposed to work in a unity pact to reconstruct the entity based on three pillars: economic, social and public security. He made public a 120 day plan to meet the most urgent problems.<ref>{{Citation

The activities of his first year as a governor are reviewed in his First Government Inform presented on September 6, 2006.<ref>Gobierno del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico, Primer informe de gobierno de Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto, gobernador constitucional del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico, 2006.</ref>  In the context of the questioned federal elections which lead the candidate of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]], supported by Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto, [[Felipe Calder<U+00F3>n]] to the victory, he invited to a national dialogue. He reported positive advances on the economic indicators of the state and the achievement of the acquired agreements during his campaign regarding education, housing and agricultural support. 

On May 3, 2006, the public forces intervened in [[Atenco]] to stop a group of flower traders from being installed in one of the main streets.  After a few hours a clash between the federal, state, municipal police and the habitants of the region was produced.  As worst outcome was the death of a young 14 year old boy. At the next day the state police got in to take over the situation and arrested 211 persons.<ref>[http://www.cndh.org.mx/recomen/2006/038.htm Recomendaci<U+00F3>n 038/2006] [[CNDH]], 16 de octubre de 2006</ref> Facts around this event have been contested and Amnesty International has asserted that during this event people were arrested without explanation and that several claims of sexual, physical and psychological abuse were made <ref>[http://takeaction.amnestyusa.org/siteapps/advocacy/index.aspx?c=jhKPIXPCIoE&b=2590179&template=x.ascx&action=11403]</ref><ref>[http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/AMR41/008/2009/en/736958b2-94fa-4a3d-bbe6-cd7d33affff3/amr410082009en.pdf]</ref>. This ONG also claims that investigations ordered by the government regarding these acts, lacked subjectivity and that people who remain still in custody have not yet met fair trials <ref>[http://www.amnesty.ie/amnesty/live/irish/action/article.asp?id=15589&page=4595]</ref>.

== The second year of government ==

Two major family events stressed his second year of government.  The first one was the death of his wife M<U+00F3>nica Pretelini on the evening of January 11, 2007. The neurologist, Paul Shkurovich, who had treated her for two years due to a convulsion crisis, affirms that her patient suffered an epileptic crisis which produced arrhythmia. This led her to have a respiratory arrest and to her death at the ABC hospital after treating her at the emergency room of the Centro M<U+00E9>dico de Toluca.<ref>[http://www.jornada.unam.mx Fallece la esposa de Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto] ''La Jornada'', 12 de enero de 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/399633.html Declaran muerte cerebral a M<U+00F3>nica Pretelini] ''El Universal'', 11 de enero de 2007</ref>

Another terrible event occurred on May 11, 2007, in [[Veracruz]]. Nicole, Alejandro and Paulina Pe<U+00F1>a Pretelini, the governor<U+2019>s children, were having holidays in the company of their maternal family members: their aunt Claudia Pretelini and their grandparents Hugo and Olga Pretelini. The group was traveling on a van through the Boulevard Manuel <U+00C1>vila Camacho of the city, and was escorted by a group of agents of the Public Security Direction of [[State of Mexico]]. At around 23:45 four vans reached them and a command of henchmen opened fire against the bodyguards Ferm<U+00ED>n Esquivel Almanza, Erick Lopez Sosa, Roberto Delgado Nabor and Guillermo Ortega Serrano died.<ref>[http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=300529 Ejecutan en Veracruz a 4 escoltas de Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto] ''La Cr<U+00F3>nica de Hoy'', 12 de mayo de 2007</ref>  The authorities of Veracruz and Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto (who was on tour in Chalco) assured that it was a confusion between organized crime groups.<ref>[http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=300529 <U+201C><U+00AB>Por confusi<U+00F3>n el asesinato de los cuatro escoltas<U+00BB> dice Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto<U+201D>] ''La Cr<U+00F3>nica de Hoy'', 12 de mayo de 2007</ref>

It was precisely this hard topic, insecurity, one of the most important subjects raised by Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto during his Second Government Inform. That was presented on September 5, 2007 at the State Congress with an unprecedented format as he permitted twelve representatives to pose questions and make interventions. In this activity report he presented his advances in security and infrastructure (the growth of a road network and the suburban train system, in coordination with the government of the D.F.) and he recognized the effort of the army to stop the clandestine cut down of trees. To this date he assured that his administration had achieved 200 of the 608 actions proposed at the beginning.<ref>Gobierno del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico, Segundo informe de gobierno de Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto, gobernador constitucional del Estado de M<U+00E9>xico, 2007.</ref>

His working team, which had been changing during the last two years, was composed, in its latest version, by:

<U+2022>	Victor Humberto Ben<U+00ED>tez Trevi<U+00F1>o: Government General secretary <br />

== Presidential Ambitions ==

During the following months after giving his Second Government Inform, the work of Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto stood out because of his collaboration with the Mexico City government, aimed at solving problems of significance for both entities politically separated but without a solution of urban continuity. Along several working sessions with [[Marcelo Ebrard]], Head of Government of [[Mexico City]], an extensive working agenda was planned which included issues such as security, environment, employment and transport. Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto stood as supporter for the energy reform, proposed a national agreement to encourage the development of the country and to accelerate the education reform and established a plan of eleven points to fight against insecurity in Mexico.<ref><U+201C>Enrique Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto present<U+00F3> 11 medidas para combatir la corrupci<U+00F3>n en el Estado de M<U+00E9>xico<U+201D>. http://www.estadodemexico.com.mx/portal/noticias/article.php?storyid=1345</ref>
According to reports in the magazine <U+201C>Tierra de Encuentro<U+201D>, Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto had accomplished by August 2008 more than half of the commitments promised during his campaign and had been able to refinance the state debt of his entity.<ref>[http://www.lapolaka.com/not_detalle.php?id_n=13690 <U+201C>Por algo es Tierra de encuentro<U+201D>].</ref> Several polls, such as the National Survey of the Strategic Communication Office, maintained that at four years to the presidential elections he was ahead of his possible contestants: [[Marcelo Ebrard]], [[Santiago Creel]] and [[Andr<U+00E9>s Manuel L<U+00F3>pez Obrador]]. In a 2008 national survey from Consulta Mitofsky people were asked to which names of governors they recognized, this resulted in 68.4% for Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto and 63.5% for Marcelo Ebrad  <ref><U+201C><U+00BF>Qui<U+00E9>nes nos gobiernan?

== Controversies ==

Pe<U+00F1>a was involved in a Supreme Court case were he and other politicians were being charged for abuse of power in the events of the [[2006 civil unrest in San Salvador Atenco]]. The court, not unanimously, exonerated Pe<U+00F1>a in 2009 under some criticism.<ref>La Corte exculp<U+00F3> a Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto en caso Atenco por presidenciable: AMLO http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/02/12/index.php?section=politica&article=009n1pol</ref>

Pe<U+00F1>a Nieto has been accused of receiving support from [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] and [[Televisa]] to become the next president <ref>http://www.proceso.com.mx/noticias_articulo.php?articulo=69874</ref> through an extensive media campaign that includes the romantic involvement with a television celebrity [[Ang<U+00E9>lica Rivera]] . Pe<U+00F1>a was also charged by his political opponents for using public money to appear in television<ref>http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/607099.html</ref>.
