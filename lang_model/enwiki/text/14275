The '''University of Sheffield''' is a research [[university]], located in [[Sheffield]] in [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]].

==History==
The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three colleges. The Sheffield School of Medicine was founded in 1828, followed in 1879 by the opening of Firth College by [[Mark Firth]], a [[steel]] manufacturer, to teach [[arts]] and [[science]] subjects. Firth College then helped to fund the opening of the Sheffield Technical School in 1884 to teach [[applied science]], the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The three institutions merged in 1897 to form the '''University College of Sheffield'''.

[[Image:Sheffield Nov 2005 011.jpg|left|thumb|Firth Court]]

It was originally envisaged that the University College would join [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]] and [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] as the fourth member of the federal [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]]. However, the Victoria University began to split-up before this could happen and so the University College of Sheffield received its own [[Royal Charter]] in 1905 and became the '''University of Sheffield'''.

From 114 full-time students in 1905, the University grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly. Many new buildings (including the famous [[Arts Tower]]) were built and student numbers increased to their present levels of over 20,000.

In 1995, the University took over the Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty although in 2005 it decided to pass these subjects over to [[Sheffield Hallam University]].

Over the years, the University has been home to a number of famous writers and scholars, including the literary critic [[William Empson]], who was head of the Department of English; author [[Angela Carter]]; the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]]-winning chemist [[Harry Kroto|Sir Harry Kroto]]; and [[Bernard Crick]], who taught politics with future [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician [[David Blunkett]] as one of his students.

==Location==
[[Image:Shefuniartstower.JPG|thumb|The [[Arts Tower]]. In recent years the windows of south facing facade have occasionally been blanked out with paper to form massive advertisements for charity campaigns.]]

The University of Sheffield is not a [[campus university]], though most of its buildings are close together. The centre of the University's presence lies one mile to the west of Sheffield city centre where there is a mile-long collection of buildings belonging almost entirely to the University. This area includes the [[students' union]], the [[Octagon Centre]], [[Firth Court]], the Geography building, the [[Alfred Denny Building]] (housing [[natural sciences]] and including a small [[museum]]), the Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings ([[chemistry]]) and the Hicks Building ([[mathematics]] and [[physics]]). The [[Listed building|Grade II*-listed]] library and [[Arts Tower]] are also located there. A concourse under the main road (the [[A57 road|A57]]) allows students to easily move between these buildings. The [[Infomation Commons]] is the newest building, added in 2007 to provide extra study space and a modern learning environment.

To the east lies St George's Campus, named for [[St George's Church, Portobello|St George's Church]], now a lecture theatre. The campus is centred on Mappin Street, home to a number of University buildings, including the faculty of [[engineering]] (partly housed in the [[Listed building|Grade II-listed]] [[Mappin Building]]) and the departments of [[management]] and [[computer science]]. The University also maintains the [[Turner Museum of Glass]] in this area. The University has recently acquired the old [[Victorian]] [[Jessop Hospital|Jessop Hospital for Women]] buildings and HSE Building and plans to convert these to house more departments, thus fully joining the West and St. George's campuses.
[[Image:Crookesmoor_2.jpg|left|thumb|The Crookesmoor Building, home of the Faculty of Law]]

Further west lies [[Weston Park]] parkland, the [[Weston Park Museum]], the [[Harold Cantor Gallery]], sports facilities and the faculties of [[law]] in the [[Crookesmoor]] area and [[medicine]], in the [[Royal Hallamshire Hospital]] (although taught in the city's extensive [[teaching hospital]]s under the [[Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], and throughout [[South Yorkshire]] and [[North East Lincolnshire]]).

Further west still lie the University [[halls of residence]], [[Ranmoor House]], Halifax Hall of Residence, Stephenson Hall of Residence and Tapton Hall of Residence, and the [[music]] department, in the [[Broomhill, Sheffield, South Yorkshire|Broomhill]] and [[Crookes]] areas of the city.

The [[Manvers]] campus, at [[Wath-on-Dearne]] between [[Rotherham]] and [[Barnsley]], is where the majority of nursing is taught.

The University of Sheffield is a major contributor to research, being the sixth most highly rated research university in the UK (2001).

The University is a member of the [[Russell Group]], the [[European University Association]], the [[Worldwide Universities Network]] and the [[White Rose University Consortium]].

The University of Sheffield is rated 8th in the UK, 18th in Europe and 65th in the world in an annual academic ranking of the top 500 universities worldwide published in August 2005. Researchers at China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University evaluated the universities using several research performance indicators, including the number of highly cited researchers, academic performance, articles in the periodicals Science and Nature, and the number of Nobel prizewinners.

The University has won [[Queen's Anniversary Awards]] in 1998, 2000 and 2002. It was also named the [[Sunday Times University of the Year]] in 2001. In 2005, the Sunday Times rated the University as the 24th best in the UK.

Sheffield is particularly famous for its [[Archaeology]], [[Architecture]], Management, [[Chemistry]], Engineering, [[English studies|English]], Geography, [[History]], Music, [[Philosophy]],[[Politics]] and Town Planning departments, which are heavily oversubscribed.

==Nobel Prizes==
The University's Faculty of Pure Science may boast an association with four [[Nobel Prizes]], one for the Department of [[Molecular Biology]] and [[Biotechnology]]:
* (1953 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], Prof. Hans Adolf Krebs, "for the discovery of the [[citric acid cycle]] in [[cellular respiration]]")

As well as three to its world-renowned Department of Chemistry:
* (1967 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (joint award), [[George Porter|Prof. George Porter]] (later Lord Porter), "for their work on extremely fast chemical reactions" (see [[Flash photolysis]])
* 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (joint award), [[Richard J. Roberts]], "for the discovery that genes in eukaryotes are not contiguous strings but contain introns, and that the splicing of messenger RNA to delete those introns can occur in different ways, yielding different proteins from the same DNA sequence" 
* 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry (joint award), [[Harry Kroto|Sir Harry Kroto]], "for their discovery of fullerenes").

With another nobel laureate, [[Howard Florey]], Sheffield shares some glory.  Howard Florey was the Joseph Hunter Professor of Pathology at Sheffield from 1932 until his move to Oxford in 1935.  In 1945 Florey and his colleague Ernst Chain, together with Alexander Fleming were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work on penicillin.

The University of Sheffield's 25,000 students arrive mostly from the [[United Kingdom|UK]], but 2,500 are international students, with many from [[Malaysia]].

The university employs 5,500 people, including almost 1,400 academic staff.

==Students' Union, Sports and Traditions==
{{main|University of Sheffield Union of Students}}
The University of Sheffield Union of Students is one of the largest students' union in the UK, with two bars (Bar One (which has a bookable function room with its own bar, The Raynor Lounge) and The Interval), three club venues (Fusion, Foundry and Octagon), one off-campus public house (The Fox and Duck), the cinema [[Film Unit]], a fully functioning and student run theatre company ([[suTCo]]), a [[student radio]] station called [[Sure Radio]], its own newspaper, [[The Steel Press]], and over one hundred student societies, many sports teams and a turnover of around <U+00A3>8,000,000.

[[Image:Sheffield University Students Union buildings.jpg|thumb|center|600px|''Left to right:'' the Hicks Building, students' union/University House (conjoined), walkway to the Octagon Centre and the Education Building (in background)]]

In addition to the student union-supported sports teams, [[Sheffield University Bankers Hockey Club]] play top-flight [[field hockey]] in the national first division. The annual [[Varsity Challenge]] takes place between teams from the University and its rival [[Sheffield Hallam University]] in over 30 events.

As part of [[rag week]], University of Sheffield students used to take part in the Pyjama Jump[http://members.tripod.com/~bocking/pyjama.html] [[pub crawl]], dressed only in nightwear in mid-winter: the men often to dress in nighties and the women in pyjamas. This event was banned in 1997 following the hospitalisation of several students.[http://www.shef.ac.uk/pr/press_releases/pr99/3-99.html] The roleplaying society run a 24 hour roleplaying event on RAG weekend. Another rag week tradition is the Spiderwalk, a fifty mile trek through the city and the [[Peak District]], the first half through the night. Although publication has been sporadic in recent years, [[Twikker]], the Rag Magazine, is usually sold to raise funds.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} <!--define "usually".  You say yourself it's sporadic-->
