'''Churchill''' ([[Inuit languages|Inuit]]: ''Kuugjuaq'')<ref>Issenman, Betty. ''Sinews of Survival: The living legacy of Inuit clothing''. UBC Press, 1997. pp252-254</ref> is a town on the West shore of [[Hudson Bay]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]]. It is most famous for the many [[polar bear]]s that move toward the shore from inland in the autumn, leading to the nickname "Polar Bear Capital of the World" that has helped its growing [[tourism]] industry.

==History==
A variety of nomadic Arctic people lived and hunted in this region. The [[Thule people]] arrived around A.D. 1000 from the West, and later evolved into the present-day [[Inuit]] culture. The [[Dene]] people arrived around 500 <!-- Before or after the Thule? --> from farther north. Since before the time of [[Europe]]an contact, the region around Churchill has been predominantly inhabited by the [[Chipewyan]] and [[Cree]] natives.

Europeans first arrived in the area in 1619 when a Danish expedition led by [[Jens Munk]] wintered where Churchill would later stand. Only 3 of 64 expedition members survived the winter and sailed one of the expedition's two ships back to [[Denmark]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Ordeal by ice; the search for the Northwest Passage |last=Mowat |first=Farley |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1973 |publisher=McClelland and Stewart Ltd |location=Toronto |oclc=1391959}}</ref>  Danish archaeologists in 1964 discovered remains of the abandoned ship in the tidal flats some miles from the mouth of the river.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

After an abortive attempt in 1688-89, in 1717 the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] built the first permanent settlement, ''Churchill River Post'', a log fort a few miles upstream from the mouth of the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]]. The [[trading post]] and river were named after [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]] (an ancestor of [[Winston Churchill]]), who was governor of the Hudson's Bay Company in the late seventeenth century. The fort was built mostly to capitalize on the [[North American fur trade]], out of the reach of [[York Factory, Manitoba|York Factory]]. It dealt mainly with the Chipewyan natives living north of the [[Taiga|boreal forest]]. Much of the fur came from as far away as [[Lake Athabasca]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]].
[[File:Churchill Fort Prince of Wales 1996-08-12.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Prince of Wales Fort]].]]

As part of the Anglo-French dispute for [[North America]], in 1731-1741 the original fort was replaced with [[Prince of Wales Fort]], a large stone fort on the western peninsula at the mouth of the river. In 1782 the fort was captured by the French, led by [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois de Galaup, comte de La P<U+00E9>rouse|La P<U+00E9>rouse]]. Since the English, under [[Samuel Hearne]], were greatly outnumbered, they surrendered without firing a shot. The leaders agreed that Hearne would be released and given safe passage to England, along with 31 English civilians, in the sloop ''Severn'', on condition that he immediately publish his story <U+2018>A Journey to the Northern Ocean<U+2019>. In return, the English promised that the same number of French prisoners would be released and an English navigator familiar with the waters safely conduct the French from Hudson<U+2019>s Bay at a time of year when the French risked becoming trapped in winter ice.<ref>{{cite book|last=McGoogan|first=Ken|title=Ancient Mariner|year=2004|publisher=Bantam Press|isbn=978-0-553-81642-6|pages=299<U+2013>307}}</ref> The French made an unsuccessful attempt to demolish the fort. The worst effect was on the natives, who had become dependent on trade goods from the fort, and many of them starved.  Extensive reconstruction and stabilization of the fort's remains have taken  place since the 1950s.

In 1783, Hearne returned to build a new fort, a short distance upriver. Due to its distance from areas of heavy competition between the [[North West Company]] and the Hudson's Bay Company, it remained a stable, if not profitable, source of furs.

Between the years of decline in the [[fur trade]] and surfacing of western agricultural success, Churchill phased into and then back out of obsolescence. After decades of frustration over the monopoly and domination of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], western Canadian governments banded together and argued for the creation of a major new northern shipping harbour on Hudson Bay, [[Hudson Bay Railway (1910)|linked by rail]] from [[Winnipeg]]. Initially [[Port Nelson, Manitoba|Port Nelson]] was selected for this purpose in 1912. After several years of effort and millions of dollars, this project was abandoned and Churchill was selected as the alternative after [[World War I|World War One]]. Surveys by the [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]] ship [[CSS Acadia|CSS ''Acadia'']] opened the way for safe navigation. However, construction and use of the railroad was extremely slow and the rail line itself did not come to Churchill until 1929.

Even once the link from farm to port was completed, commercial shipping took many more years to pick up. In 1932 [[Grant MacEwan]] was the first person to cross through Churchill customs as a passenger. This was purely due to his determination in taking the Hudson Bay route to [[Saskatchewan]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]<U+2014>most passengers returned via the [[Saint Lawrence River]].

In 1942, the [[United States Army Air Corps]] established a base called Fort Churchill, located five miles east of the town. After World War II, this base was jointly operated by Canada and the United States for experimental and training purposes and was in operation until the mid-1960s.

Naval Radio Station Churchill, callsign CFL, was activated as an ionospheric study station by the RCN in support of the U-boat HFDF net and  became operational  on August 1, 1943.  Around 1949, Churchill became part of the Canadian SUPRAD (signals intelligence) network  and remained in that role until it closed its doors in 1968. The Operations and Accommodations building still remains today but is abandoned.

This area was also the site of the [[Churchill Rocket Research Range]], part of Canadian-American atmospheric research. Its first rocket was launched in 1956, and it continued to host launches for research until closing in 1984. The site of the former rocket range now hosts the Churchill Northern Studies Centre, a facility for [[Arctic]] research. Churchill still hosts a rocket range and subsequent [[Spaceport Canada]] effort; currently located at [[Fort Churchill (rocket launch site)|Fort Churchill]].

In the 1950s, the British government considered establishing a site near Churchill for testing their early nuclear weapons, before choosing Australia instead.<ref>{{cite journal | title = O Lucky Canada - Britain considered testing nuclear weapons in northern Manitoba but found the climate in Australia much more agreeable. | first2 = John | journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | last1 = O'Brien | last2 = Clearwater | date = July/August 2003 | first = John Clearwater and David O<U+2019>Brien | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 60<U+2013>65| doi = 10.2968/059004015 | url = http://bos.sagepub.com/content/59/4/60.full.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-11-07}}</ref>

==Environment==
[[File:B<U+00E4>renmutter & Junge 9 2000-11-20.jpg|thumb|Polar bears on the ice.]]
Churchill is situated at the [[estuary]] of the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] at Hudson Bay. The small community stands at an [[ecotone]], on the [[Hudson Plains Ecozone (CEC)|Hudson Plains]], at the juncture of three [[ecoregion]]s: the boreal forest to the south, the Arctic [[tundra]] to the northwest, and the Hudson Bay to the north. [[Wapusk National Park]] is located to the south of the town.

The landscape around Churchill is influenced by shallow soils caused by a combination of subsurface [[permafrost]] and [[Canadian Shield]] rock formation. The [[Picea mariana|Black Spruce]] dominant tree cover is sparse and stunted from these environmental constraints. There is also a noticeable ''[[ice pruning]]'' effect to the trees.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 ''Black Spruce: Picea mariana'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. Nicklas Stromberg, November 2008]</ref> The area also offers sport fishing. Several tour operators offer expeditions on land, sea and air, using all terrain vehicles, tundra buggies, boats, canoes, helicopters and even [[ultralight aviation|ultralight aircraft]].

===Aurora Borealis===
Like all northern communities in Canada,  [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora Borealis]] (Northern Lights) can sometimes be seen when there is a high amount of solar activity.  Visibility also depends on the sky being dark enough to see them, which usually precludes their visibility in the summer due to twilight all night long.

===Climate===
Churchill has a borderline [[subarctic climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]]: ''Dfc'') due to its location above the tree line with long very cold winters, and short, cool to mild summers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr/5/c005p049.pdf |title=Strategies for revegetation of disturbed gravel areas in climate stressed subarctic environments with special reference to Churchill, Manitoba, Canada: a literature review |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref> Churchill's winters are colder than a location at a latitude of 58 degrees north should warrant, given its coastal location. The shallow Hudson Bay freezes, eliminating any maritime moderation. Prevailing northerly winds from the [[North Pole]] jet across the frozen bay and chill it to a {{Convert|-26.0|<U+00B0>C}}<ref name="envcan"/> January average. [[Juneau, Alaska]], by contrast, is also located at 58 degrees north but is moderated by the warmer and deeper [[Pacific Ocean]]. Juneau's {{convert|<U+2212>3.5|<U+00B0>C}}<ref name="noaa">[http://www.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=pajk NOAA weather]. Temperature averages for [[Juneau International Airport]] 1971-2000</ref> January average temperature is a full {{convert|22.5|C-change}} warmer than Churchill's. Yet in summer, when the Hudson Bay thaws, Churchill's summer is moderated. Churchill's {{convert|12.7|<U+00B0>C}}<ref name="envcan"/> July average temperature is almost the same as Juneau's {{convert|13.8|<U+00B0>C}}<ref name="noaa"/> July average. Churchill is laying just south of the parallel of [[Sweden|Swedish]] capital [[Stockholm]], which has a significantly milder climate, with all months being significantly warmer than that of coastal Northern Manitoba. This is due to the lack of influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] on the Hudson Bay climate.

==Economy==
Tourism and [[ecotourism]] are major contributors to the local economy, with the polar bear season (October/November) being the largest. Tourists also visit to see the beluga whales in the Churchill River in June/July. The area is also popular for birdwatchers and to view the [[aurora borealis]]. The Port of Churchill is the terminus for the Hudson Bay Railroad operated by Omnitrax. The port facilities handle shipments of grain and other commodities around the world. The Northern Studies Centre also attracts visitors and acdemics from around the world interested in sub-Arctic and Arctic research. The town also has a health centre, several hotels, tour operators, and restaurants, to serve locals and visitors.

===Ecotourism===

Churchill is situated along Manitoba's {{convert|1400|km|abbr=on}} coastline, on Hudson Bay at the meeting of three major [[biome]]s: marine, boreal forest and tundra,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/tundra.php |title=Churchill, tundra biome |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.k12.nf.ca/climatecanada/churchill.htm |title=Churchill, boreal forest biome |publisher=Grc.k12.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchill.ca/things-to-do/main |title=Chrurchill, Marine, Tundra, and Boreal Forest |publisher=Churchill.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic55-3-291.pdf |title=Integrated Management Planning in Canada's Northern Marine Environment: Engaging Coastal Communities |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref> each supporting a variety of flora and fauna. Each year, 10,000-12,000 eco-tourists visit, about 400-500 of whom are birders.

====Polar bears====
Starting in the 1980s, the town developed a sizable tourism industry focused on the migration habits of the polar bear. Tourists can safely view [[polar bear]]s from specially modified buses known as ''[[tundra buggy|tundra buggies]]''. Use of the buggies helps sustain local tourism, but can also cause damage to the local ecosystem when driven outside the established trails. October and early November are the most feasible times to see polar bears, thousands of which wait on the vast peninsula until the water freezes on Hudson Bay so that they can return to hunt their primary food source, [[ringed seal]]s. There are also opportunities to see polar bears in the non-winter months, with tours via boat visiting the coastal areas where polar bears can be found both on land and swimming in the sea.

Many locals even leave their cars unlocked in case someone needs to make a quick escape from the polar bears in the area.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=John|title=Churchill offers best glimpse of polar bears|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2012/09/25/churchill-offers-best-glimpse-of-polar-bears|work=Toronto Sun|publisher=Toronto Sun|accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref> Local authorities maintain a so-called "polar bear jail" where bears (mostly adolescents) who persistently loiter in or close to town, are held after being tranquilised, pending release back into the wild when the bay freezes over. It is the subject of a poem, ''Churchill Bear Jail'', by [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Salish]] Chief Victor A. Charlo.<ref>{{cite book|last=Charlo|first=Victor A|title=Put Se<U+00FD> (Good Enough), Poems|year=2008|publisher=Many Voices Press, [[Flathead Valley Community College]]|location=Kalispell, Montana|isbn=978-0979518515|pages=30<U+2013>31}}</ref>  Polar bears were once thought to be solitary animals that would avoid contact with other bears except for mating. In the Churchill region, however, many alliances between bears are made in the fall. These friendships last only until the ice forms, then it is every bear for himself to hunt [[ringed seal]]s.

====Beluga whales====
Thousands of [[beluga (whale)|beluga whales]], which move into the warmer waters of the Churchill River estuary during July and August to calf, are a major summer attraction.

====Birds====
Churchill is also a destination for [[Birdwatching|bird watchers]] from late May until August.<ref>[http://www.virtualmuseum.cExhibitions/Birds/MMMN/English/index.html Bird watching]</ref> Birders have recorded more than 270 species within a {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on}} radius of Churchill, including [[Snowy Owl]], [[Tundra Swan]], [[American Golden Plover]] and [[Gyrfalcon]]. Plus, more than 100 birds, including [[Arctic Skua|Parasitic Jaeger]], [[Smith's Longspur]], [[Stilt Sandpiper]], and [[Harris's Sparrow]], nest there.<ref>{{cite news | first=Gary | last=Kramer | coauthors= | title=Where to Go Birdwatching at Churchill on Hudson Bay, Manitoba, Canada | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.birdersworld.com/brd/default.aspx?c=a&id=635 | work =Worl Birder's Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-13 | language = }}</ref>

===Health care===
The town has a modern health centre, the [[Churchill Regional Health Authority]], which employs about 100 people. It provides 44 beds, dental care and diagnostic laboratories to service the residents of Churchill and the communities of the [[Kivalliq Region]] (Keewatin) of [[Nunavut]].<ref>[http://www.churchillrha.mb.ca/ Churchill Regional Health Authority]</ref>
