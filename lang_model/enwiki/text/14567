The Greater Alabama Council Number One is a division of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].  It is located in northern and central Alabama.

In the 1990s, the Boy Scouts of America went through a restructuring in an attempt to reduce manpower, and in several states small historic Councils were merged into a larger ''supercouncil''.  The new '''Greater Alabama Council''' is an example of such a supercouncil. The council office is located in Birmingham, Alabama.
