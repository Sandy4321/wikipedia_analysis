'''HMS ''Nene''''', later '''HMCS ''Nene''''' (pennant K270), was a [[River-class frigate]], designed for [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] operations, which was crewed by both the [[Royal Navy|British]] and the [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]] navies during [[World War II]].

==Royal Navy==
HMS ''Nene'' was built at Smith's Dock, Middlesborough, England.  It was launched on 9 December, 1942, and commissioned on 8 April 1943 into the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=hird>Hird, David M., ''The Grey Wolves of Eriball'', Bell & Bain, Ltd, Glasgow, 2010.</ref> A [[Warship Week]] National Savings effort led to the community of [[Oundle]] - which lies on the [[River Nene]] - in Northamptonshire adopting the ship.<ref>Geoffrey B Mason (2005)</ref>

The ship joined the [[Western Approaches]] Command at [[Londonderry, Northern Ireland]], and crossed the Atlantic on convoy duty to St. John's, Newfoundland. The ship was involved in operations of the Royal Navy Support Group, then attached to the 5th and later 6th Escort Group, [[Western Approaches Command]].<ref name=riley>Riley, Keith (ed.), ''Nene Lives: the Story of the H.M.C.S. Nene and her Crew'', Ottawa, 1993</ref> In February 1944, the frigate was involved in anti-submarine operations off the west coast of Ireland, assisting in the sinking of submarine [[German submarine U-536|U-536]] near the [[Azores]].<ref name=mac>Macpherson, Ken, "Nene", ''Frigates of the Royal Canadian Navy: 1943 - 1973"", Vanwell Publishing,St. Catherines, 1989.</ref>

==Royal Canadian Navy==
In March of 1944 HMS ''Nene'' arrived at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], where the ship underwent a refit and was recommissioned to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], as HMCS ''Nene'' (K270). In July the ship headed to [[Bermuda]] on a training run for the new crew, after which the Nene joined [[Escort Group]] C5 Western Approaches Command.<ref name=riley /> From the group's base at Londonderry, the ship escorted three trans-atlantic convoys with this group.<ref name=mac />

HMCS ''Nene'' served briefly as part of the convoy JW-61A, escorting personnel carriers,<ref name=riley /> and then was assigned to Escort Group 9. After anti-submarine patrol around the British Isles, during which two of the group's ships were torpedoed,<ref name=riley /> the frigate became one of many ships escorting convoys on the [[Murmansk Run]].<ref>Ruegg, Bob, and Hague, Arnold, ''Convoys to Russia'', World Ship Society, 1992</ref> In April 1945, at Portsmouth harbour, the S.S. ''Cuba'', was torpedoed, and the crew of the ''Nene'' rescued 265 sailors from the sinking ship.<ref name=riley />

In May 1945, as the war ended, HMCS ''Nene'' was called away from convoy duty to take part in the surrender of a group of fifteen German submarines, including U-992 and U-997, which were escorted to [[Loch Eriboll]], Scotland, for disposal.<ref name=hird /><ref name=riley />
In June, at Sheerness, ''Nene'' was returned to the Royal Navy.  Her Canadian crew were sent to the naval base at Greenlock, Scotland to await the trip home.<ref name=riley />

''Nene'' was reclassified as a B2 reserve ship, was towed to [[Harwich]] and later to [[Barrow-in-Furness]],<ref name=riley /> and finally broken up for salvage in 1955 by T. W. Ward Ltd. at [[Briton Ferry]], [[Wales]].<ref name=hird /><ref name=mac />
