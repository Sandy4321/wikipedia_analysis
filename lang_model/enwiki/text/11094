'''Sembawang Air Base''' {{Airport codes||WSAG}} is a [[military airbase]] of the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] located at Sembawang, in the northern part of [[Singapore]]. The base motto is ''"Dare and Will"''.

==RAF Sembawang==
Prior to [[Singapore]]'s independence from the [[United Kingdom]], it was a [[Royal Air Force station]] known as '''RAF Sembawang''' as well as being the Royal Naval Air Station - [[List of_air stations of the Royal Navy#Former Naval Air Stations by ship name (HMS xxx)|HMS Simbang]] - to the carrier pilots of the [[Fleet Air Arm|Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm]] (attached to the [[Eastern Fleet]] based in Singapore) who used it for rest and refit whenever an [[List of aircraft carriers by country#United Kingdom|aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy]] berthed at the nearby [[Singapore Naval Base|HMNB Singapore]] for refuel and repairs, which also housed the largest [[Royal Navy]] dockyard east of Suez up to the time of UK forces withdrawal from Singapore.

After the Japanese capture of Singapore during [[World War II]], the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] took over the two RAF stations of Sembawang and [[Seletar Airport|Seletar]]. Singapore was split into  north-south spheres of control, and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] took over [[RAF Tengah]]. It was not until September 1945 that the two airfields reverted back to British control following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]].

RAF Sembawang was a key part of Britain's continued military presence in the [[Far East]] (along with the three other RAF bases in Singapore: [[Changi Air Base|RAF Changi]], [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]], [[Tengah Air Base|RAF Tengah]]) during the critical period of the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948<U+2013>1960), the [[Brunei Revolt]] in 1962 and the [[Indonesia<U+2013>Malaysia confrontation]] (1962<U+2013>1966).

==Sembawang Air Base==
The base was renamed '''Sembawang Air Base (SBAB)''' in 1971 when it was handed over to the Singapore Air Defence Command (SADC). From 1971 to 1976, under the auspices of the [[Five Power Defence Arrangements]] (FPDA), Sembawang housed British, Australian and New Zealand forces.

In 1983, the airbase became a full fledged [[Rotorcraft|rotary-wing]] air base when the first resident helicopter squadron - [[120 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|120 Squadron]] - was permanently relocated from [[Changi Air Base]].

Currently, there are approximately 100 helicopters based in Sembawang Air Base, almost all are operating in support of the [[Singapore Army]] and the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]. It is the home base to all the RSAF helicopter squadrons, consisting of AS-332 Super Pumas, CH-47SD Chinooks, [[Sikorsky S-70|Sikorsky S-70B]] (derivative of [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk]]) naval helicopters,<ref>http://www.defencetalk.com/singapore-begins-operating-new-s-70-helicopters-24948/ 'Defence Talk : Singapore Begins Operating New S-70 Helicopters'</ref> as well as the Fennecs and UH-1Hs, which are currently stored in reserve. Recently added to the base are the AH-64D Longbow Apache attack helicopters.

The Flying squadrons are:
*[[120 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|120 Squadron]] with 20 [[Boeing AH-64 Apache#AH-64D|AH-64D Longbow Apache]]s;
*[[123 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|123 Squadron]] with 6 [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk#Export versions|S-70B Seahawk]]s, these are owned and operated by the Republic of Singapore navy but flown by RSAF pilots;
*[[124 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|124 Squadron]] with 5 [[Eurocopter EC120 Colibri|EC120 Colibri]], headquartered at SBAB with a training detachment at [[Seletar Airport]];
*[[125 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|125 Squadron]] with 22 [[Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma|AS332M Super Puma]], four of these are configured for [[Search and rescue]] duties;
*[[126 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|126 Squadron]] with 12 [[Eurocopter AS532 Cougar|AS532UL/AL Cougar]] but is currently based at [[Oakey Army Aviation Centre|Oakey Airbase]] in support of SAF's training need in Australia;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/1999/aug/20aug99_nr.html |title=Opening Ceremony of the RSAF Helicopter Detachment in Oakey, Australia |publisher=MINDEF }}</ref>
*[[127 Squadron, Republic of Singapore Air Force|127 Squadron]] with 6 [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook#CH-47D|CH-47D]] and 12 [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook#Other export models|CH-47SD Chinooks]].<ref name="AFM284">{{cite journal|last=Jerry|first=Gunner|date=November 2011|title=Chinook at 50 - World Wokka Operators - Republic of Singapore Air Force|journal=[[Air Forces Monthly]]|publisher=[[Key Publishing|Key Publishing Ltd]]|volume=284|pages=p.88 (pp.84<U+2013>90)|issn=09557091|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>

The Support Squadrons are:
*Air Logistics Squadron (ALS)
*Airfield Maintenance Squadron (AMS)
*Field Defence Squadron (FDS)
*Flying Support Squadron (FSS)

Currently, the RSAF's [[Chong Pang Camp]] '''SADA (Singapore Air Defence Artillery)''', with its associated Air Defence assets, is also located within the compound of the air base as well as the famous local [[Sembawang Hot Spring]].
