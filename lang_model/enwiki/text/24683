'''''The Litigators''''' is a 2011 legal thriller novel by [[John Grisham]], his 25th [[fiction]] novel overall. ''The Litigators'' is about a two-[[partner (business rank)|partner]] Chicago [[law firm]] attempting to strike it rich in a [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] over a [[cholesterol]] reduction drug by a major [[pharmaceutical drug]] company. The [[protagonist]] is a [[Harvard Law School]] grad big law firm burnout who stumbles upon the boutique and joins it only to find himself litigating against his old law firm in this case. The book is regarded as more humorous than most of Grisham's prior novels.

Critical reviews were mixed for the book, with several opinions noting a lack of suspense. Nonetheless, the book has achieved both hardcover and ebook #1 best seller status on various lists, including both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.  However, since some services do not separate fiction and non-fiction books, it did not debut as a #1 bestseller on certain lists, such as the ''[[USA Today]]''. Some reviewers noted that this story would lend itself to an adapted screenplay.

==Background==
[[File:John Grisham crop.jpg|left|Grisham in 2008|thumb]]
Having sold 250 million copies of his previous 24 novels in 29 languages, Grisham had produced an international best seller with each prior book.<ref name=Gtace>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/28/living/john-grisham-author-interview/|title=Grisham talks ambulance chasers, eBooks|accessdate=2011-10-30|date=2011-10-28|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=DuChateau, Christian}}</ref><ref name=T/> Including the release of ''The Litigators'', Grisham has produced 23 adult fiction novels and 2 childrens fiction novels as well as a [[short story]] collection. In addition, he has produced one non-fiction book.

In the first of a two-part interview with ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Grisham claimed that although he usually attempts to include humor in his submitted drafts, it is usually removed during the editorial process.

==Plot==
Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering partners of a small twenty-plus year old [[law firm]] in the western part of the [[South Side, Chicago|South side]] of Chicago that tries to appear to be successful although it is really a small-time operation. Generally, the firm focuses on simple divorces and [[DUI]] cases, with an occasional automobile accident that provides a boon to the firm.  Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish junior partner Wally and his questionable ethics.<ref name=GACPGoDC/> The novel presents Finley & Figg as a law firm so far down the food chain that it advertises on [[Bingo (card game)|bingo]] cards.<ref name=AvtGcn/>

The story depicts the changes that occur when a young formerly successful down-and-out attorney, David Zinc, relegates himself to working as an associate with Finley & Figg (F&F) and an enormous case avails itself.<ref name=TLRH/> Zinc is the hero, but after an anxiety attack and drinking binge, he finds himself on the doorstep of F&F.<ref name=BRJGTLassr/> With the change in employment, Zinc instantly goes from a 93rd-floor office at Rogan Rothberg to a South Side firm that is conveniently located near one of Chicago's most accident prone intersections between a massage parlor and a lawnmower repair shop.<ref name=BRJGTLassr/><ref name=ITLJGfohc/> An early client in the story is DeeAnna Nuxhall, who was a repeat divorce customer but unable to pay her legal fees.<ref>Grisham, pp. 77&ndash;79.</ref> When her boyfriend failed to coerce the firm into service, she paid her divorce fees in kind and became Wally's love interest.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 12.</ref> He would break up with her much later when it was convenient for him to do so.<ref>Grisham, p. 245.</ref>

As part of the routine, Rochelle checks the [[obituary|obituaries]] to see if any of their estate clients has passed away. One day, Chester Marino's name is listed and Wally makes his way to the proper funeral home.  He meets Lyle Marino, the son whose interests F&F were suppose to represent against children from a second marriage. Lyle claims that his father was killed by Krayoxx, whetting Wally's tongue to the case.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 4.</ref> After finding a few former clients who had valid claims, the firm was able to generate publicity in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' with a picture of their filing. This induced an avalanche of communications and led them to several additional claimants.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 13.</ref>

At first, the case seems to be a simple opportunity to sign up patients who took the extremely popular cholesterol reduction drug, Krayoxx, which was the number one prescription for obese patients.<ref name=TLRH/> Varrick Labs is the third largest pharmaceuticals company in the world.<ref name=AvtGcn>{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/the-litigators-by-john-grisham/article2225574/|title=A visit to Grisham country north|accessdate=2011-11-05|date=2011-11-04|work=[[Globe and Mail]]|author=Orenstein, Larry}}</ref> Krayoxx is produced by Varrick Labs, a $25 billion/year pharmaceutical giant which is dealing with a preponderance of [[heart attack]]s by its customers.  Wally notices a blossoming [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] in Florida against Varrick and realizes that if he can find some patients to sign as clients, he can earn a big payday on another firm's coattails. However, some complications make the story interesting.<ref name=TLRH>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/213068/the-litigators-by-john-grisham|title=The Litigators|accessdate=2011-09-18|publisher=[[Random House, Inc.]]}}</ref> Although none of the three F&F lawyers had previously argued in [[United States federal courts|United States federal court]], that is where they find themselves pitted against Zinc's old firm with this case.<ref name=BRJGTLassr/> In fact, David's expertise was in long-term [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].<ref name=GACPGoDC/>

Once the Finley & Figg become prominent, mass tort operators approach them about being part of a mass settlement.  Wally flies to Las Vegas to meet with the other mass tort interests, most notably Jerry Alisandros.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 16.</ref> Varrick flew to Chicago to meet with Nadine Karros, a leading defense attorney. Karros works for Rogan Rothberg.  Believing that they can get federal judge Harry Seawright to claim jurisdiction, Karros is chosen for her firms' ties to him and her expertise.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 17.</ref>  The case was soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 19.</ref> Eventually, Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases separated.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 23.</ref> Eventually, Alisandros learns that tests of Krayoxx yield benign results.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 32.</ref> Oscar and his wife, Paula, are often at odds, and as a large settlement looms, she attempts to divorce him and cash out.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 33.</ref> After settlement talks break down with Varrick, Alisandros withdraws as co-counsel and Finley & Figg motions to withdraw their claims.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 34.</ref>

Once at Finley & Figg, Zinc stumbles upon a [[lead poisoning]] [[brain damage]] case involving Burmese immigrants.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 20.</ref> He expends his own time and resources on their case.<ref>Grisham, p. 163.</ref><ref>Grisham, pp. 171&ndash;2.</ref><ref>Grisham, Ch. 27.</ref> He also succeeds in representing immigrants in a [[labor law]] case.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 31.</ref> During the labor case, the employer attempted to have Finley & Figg burned down and the individual who attempted to do so stumbled upon Wally at the office. Wally shot him and added an unnecessary debilitating shot that shattered the person's leg.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 29.</ref> He was sued for excessive force.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 33.</ref>

With Varrick having spent 18 million dollars defending himself and the mass tort bar having vociferously discredited Krayoxx in the mass media, Karros motioned for [[frivolous lawsuit]] sanctions pending a withdrawn motion. Additionally, actions were initiated for [[legal malpractice]] regarding Wally's letters that promised $2million dollar settlement followed by motions to dismiss without notifying his clients.  After realizing that they could be sued for defense costs and malpractice for withdrawing the case, Finley & Figg withdraw their motions and agree to a [[jury trial]] that they believe to be futile.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 35.</ref> The trial commenced as originally scheduled.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 37.</ref> During [[opening statement]]s, Oscar suffered a [[myocardial infarction]]. Wally attempted to make light of the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx effects.  Karros moved for [[mistrial]] and the motion was granted, leading to the need to seat a new jury.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 38.</ref> Wally stood in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury was seated and for the first day of testimony.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 39.</ref> The next day, the recovering [[alcoholic]] Figg was nowhere to be found although an empty [[pint]] bottle of [[Smirnoff Vodka]] was.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 40.</ref> After Wally was AWOL for a second day, David was pressed into service.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 41.</ref> Rueben Massey, Varrick CEO, instructed Karros not to motion for likely-successful [[summary judgment]].<ref>Grisham, Ch. 43.</ref> Zinc declined to [[cross-examine]] the first handful of [[expert witness]]es that Varrick called,<ref>Grisham, Chs. 44&ndash;5.</ref> Eventually, Zinc discredited the reputation Varrick's [[clinical trial]]s during cross-examination of the final expert witness.<ref>Grisham, Ch. 45.</ref> Nonetheless, the jury rendered a very quick [[not guilty]] [[verdict]].<ref>Grisham, Ch. 46.</ref>

==Critical review==
''The Litigators'' is said to be "an amusing and appalling look into the machinations of a nationwide class-action suit," according to Tobin Harshaw of [[Bloomberg L.P.]]<ref name=GACPGoDC/>  ''The Wall Street Journal'''s [[Christopher John Farley]] noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works.<ref name=JGGtLLotL/> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it a "bitingly farcical look at lawyers at the bottom of the food chain".<ref name=TLPW>{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-53513-7|title=The Litigators|accessdate=2011-10-26|date=2011-10-24|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]}}</ref> [[CNN]] described the book as an original perspective of "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer".<ref name=Gtace/> Louis Bayard of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be a good starting point for those who have tired of Grisham.<ref name=BRJGTLassr>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-john-grishams-the-litigators-a-swerving-stirring-retort/2011/10/19/gIQAEUD81L_story.html|title=Book review: John Grisham<U+2019>s <U+201C>The Litigators<U+201D> a swerving, stirring retort|accessdate=2011-10-22|date=2011-10-20|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=Bayard, Louis}}</ref>  Andrea Simakis of ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' describes the book as a "heartier meal" than Grisham's usual "potato-chip fiction".<ref name=ITLJGfohc/> ''Publishers Weekly'' also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's [[dark humor]].<ref name=TLPW/> Rick Arthur of The [[United Arab Emirates]] publication ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works ''[[The Street Lawyer]]'' and ''[[The King of Torts]]'' and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of ''The Firm'' and ''[[The Rainmaker (John Grisham)|The Rainmaker]]''.<ref name=JGTLTN/> Geoffrey Wansell of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away."<ref name=T/> Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.<ref name=T/>

There book has been derided for its lack of suspense.  Carol Memmott of ''[[USA Today]]'' says that Grisham's latest attempt to capture the spirit of the legal [[David and Goliath]] story is missing "the ratcheting-up of suspense" that he has employed successfully in recent adult and youth novels.<ref name=VGLfs>{{cite web|url=http://books.usatoday.com/book/john-grisham-the-litigators/r557414|title=Verdict: Grisham<U+2019>s <U+2018>Litigators<U+2019> falls short |accessdate=2011-10-25|date=2011-10-24|author=Memmott, Carol |work=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> Harshaw claims that the book is lacking in the suspense that made ''[[The Firm (novel)|The Firm]]'' so successful.<ref name=GACPGoDC/> Arthur finds elements of the plot implausible and the story unsuspensful as well as unsatisfying.<ref name=JGTLTN>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/john-grisham-the-litigators|title=John Grisham: The Litigators|accessdate=2011-11-03|date=2011-11-04|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|author=Arthur, Rick}}</ref> Although the book is somewhat predictable, Bayard notes that "Grisham swerves clear of the usual melodramatic devices. Corporations aren<U+2019>t intrinsically venal; plaintiffs aren<U+2019>t lambent with goodness. And best of all, no one is murdered for stumbling Too Close to the Truth."<ref name=BRJGTLassr/>

Some sources noted that the book has potential to become an adapted screenplay.  ''[[Irish Independent]]'' describes Grisham's new book as "following his usual route to the bestsellers list" and projects it as a candidate to be his next hollywood film. Although it is standard Grisham fare, ''Independent'' noted that it provides the usual thrills in Grisham's comfortable legal world and should be a gripping read for his usual fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/review-fiction-the-litigators-by-john-grisham-2913853.html|title=Review: Fiction: The Litigators by John Grisham|accessdate=2011-10-22|date=2011-10-22|work=[[Irish Independent]]|author=Walsh, Rowena}}</ref> The ''[[Daily Express|Sunday Express]]'' noted that the book could be readily converted to a screenplay, but its critic, Robin Callender Smith, viewed the "ambulance chasing" ethos as a foreign thing that Brits might have to worry about in the near future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/280664/Book-Review-The-Litigators-John-Grisham-Hodder-Stoughton-19-99|title=Book Review - The Litigators, John Grisham Hodder & Stoughton, <U+00A3>19.99|accessdate=2011-10-31|date=2011-10-30|work=[[Daily Express|Sunday Express]]|author=Smith, Robin Callender}}</ref>
