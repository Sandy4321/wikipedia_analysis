'''Bruno Maddox''' (born [[November 15]] [[1969]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[literary fiction|literary novelist]] and journalist who is best known for his critically lauded novel ''My Little Blue Dress'' (2001) and for his satirical magazine essays.

After graduating from [[Harvard University]] in 1992, Maddox began his career reviewing books for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]] Book World''.  In early 1996, he was appointed to an editorship at ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine and within a few months he was promoted to editor-in-chief, a position he held until the magazine shut down in 1998.  Maddox wrote ''My Little Blue Dress'' between 1999 and 2001.  Since its publication, he has focused on writing satirical essays for magazines such as ''[[Gear (magazine)|GEAR]]'' and ''[[Travel + Leisure]]''; he also contributes a monthly humor column to ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine called "Blinded by Science", drawing on his early exposure to science and technology.  Maddox is likewise a [[contributing editor]] to the American edition of ''[[The Week]]'' magazine.<ref name=TheWeekGreenIssue/>

==Early years==
Maddox was born in [[London]] in 1969 to former ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor Sir [[John Maddox]], a writer on science and nature, and [[Brenda Maddox]], a biographer of [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[W.B. Yeats]], [[Nora Barnacle]] and several others.<ref name=NinaBlount/><ref name=AboutBBS>{{cite web |title=About Blinded By Science columns |work=[[Discover Magazine|Discover]] |url=http://discovermagazine.com/columns/blinded-by-science |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Touching base |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature Genetics]] |volume=28 |year=2001 |pages=305 |url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v28/n4/full/ng0801_305.html |doi=10.1038/91050 |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> He has one sister, Bronwen, who became a journalist and is Chief Foreign Commentator of ''[[The Times]]'' as of 2008.<ref name=PenguinBio>{{cite web |title=About Bruno Maddox |publisher=[[Penguin Group (USA)]] |url=http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000037427,00.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=About Bronwen Maddox |work=[[The Times]] |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/bronwen_maddox/ |accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref>

Despite his family's background in science, Maddox was interested in the [[humanities]] while he attended [[Westminster School]], an independent boys' school in London. Maddox went on to study [[English literature]] at [[Harvard University]] and graduated in 1992.<ref name=PublicityMaterial/>  He published his first and only article in the [[student newspaper]] ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' during his [[Student#Post-second_year|senior]] year.<ref>{{cite news |author=Bruno Maddox |title=Cabot Turns Trash Into Art: Superintendent Urges Residents on to Ecolympic Laurels |date=[[1991-02-15]] |work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=243329 |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> He won the undergraduate [[Thomas T.

Maddox's freelance writing career began in 1994, when he became a book reviewer for ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', where he developed a reputation for writing scathing reviews that would later help him land a job as an editor at ''[[Spy (magazine)|SPY]]'' magazine.<ref name=Andelman_interview/><ref>{{cite news|title=One Last Hurrah |author=Bruno Maddox |date=[[1994-01-23]] |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis<U+00AE> Academic]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=In Short: Nonfiction |author=Bruno Maddox |date=[[1994-07-17]] |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Maddox described his book reviewing style as "pretty vicious", and quipped that he "was a frustrated, twenty-something guy, sitting in his bedroom venting existential rage on these nasty academics".<ref name=Andelman_interview/> His last book review for ''The Washington Post'' was in late 1996; however, he continued reviewing for ''The New York Times'' up until 1998, contributing only a couple of reviews thereafter.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monsters of Our Own Making |author=Bruno Maddox |date=[[1996-09-29]] |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis<U+00AE> Academic]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Blade Runner |author=Bruno Maddox |date=[[1998-03-22]] | work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/22/reviews/980322.22maddoxt.html |accessdate=2007-09-01}}</ref> 

At the beginning of the [[dot-com boom]], Maddox found full-time work at an [[information technology]] company, where he worked for a year and a half.<ref name=ACE_interview/>

==Editorship of ''Spy'' magazine==

In mid-1996, Maddox was hired as a [[senior editor]] at ''[[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]'' magazine, a [[satirical]] monthly, in New York City.<ref name=Andelman_interview/>  ''Spy'' had ceased publication in 1994 but was quickly resuscitated under new ownership by Sussex Publishers Inc., which reduced the magazine's frequency from ten to six issues a year.<ref name=Sussex>{{cite news |title=Spy goes under for the last time |author=Neil Cassidy |date=[[1998-03-01]] |publisher=''Folio: The Magazine for Magazine Management'' reprinted by FindArticles.com |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3065/is_n3_v27/ai_20350760 |accessdate=2007-04-15}}</ref>  At ''Spy'', Maddox was assisted by deputy editor Adam Lehner, a satirist.<ref name=Salon-Spy>{{cite news |title=Media Circus: Spy vs. Spy |author=[[James Surowiecki]] |date=[[1997-09-02]] |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |url=http://www.salon.com/sept97/media/media970902.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> In December 1996, Maddox was promoted to editor-in-chief;<ref name=Andelman_interview>{{cite news |title=Mr. Media Spies on Spy! |author=Bob Andelman |date=[[1997-04-14]] |work=[[Universal Press Syndicate]] |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20001101213832/http://www.andelman.com/mrmedia/97/04.14.97.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> his editorial team included [[Jared Paul Stern]] and, beginning in late 1997, future screenwriter [[William Monahan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Reporter Was Quick Study in Art of Mingling With the Rich and Glamorous |author=Marc Santora |date=[[2006-04-09]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/nyregion/09stern.html |accessdate=2007-08-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Standing at the corner of Shakespeare and Scorsese |author=Sam Allis |date=[[2006-10-03]] |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2006/10/03/standing_at_the_corner_of_shakespeare_and_scorcese/ |accessdate=2007-08-08 }}</ref>

Maddox wanted to turn ''Spy'' into a national magazine rather than build on its legacy of covering stories that centered on New York.  According to Maddox, two factors motivated the shift of [[target market]]. The magazine's past objects of satire, the "cheesy villains who anointed themselves as targets" in the 1980s, were no longer on the national stage. Meanwhile, the "sins of the '90s [were] those of a private, quiet cultivation of a sense of purity", and were harder to expose or ridicule.<ref name=Salon-Spy/>

In early 1998, Sussex Publishers increased ''Spy''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s frequency from six to nine issues a year in an effort to boost readership and ad pages. ''Spy'''s paid circulation continued to drop during Maddox's tenure, and in March 1998, the magazine once again ceased publication.  Sussex's President and CEO John Colman concluded that "[despite the] great work by Bruno and his team, there just wasn't the [advertiser and consumer] acceptance that we need to make it financially viable".<ref name=Sussex/>  Maddox conceded that "a satirical magazine in New York in the late Nineties really had no function", because "everyone was being very modest and coy".<ref name=NinaBlount>{{cite news |title=my little blue dress: bruno maddox talks to ivenus about the post-post-postmodern novel |author=Nina Blount |date=2001 |publisher=iVenus.com |url=http://www.ivenus.com/culture/books/features/CU-FP-FullLength-wk58.asp |accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

In 1999, Maddox sold the advance rights to his first [[novel]], ''My Little Blue Dress'', to a German publisher based on a five-page fax proposal he sent on the advice of his [[literary agent]] [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]].<ref name=ACE_interview>{{cite web|title=Back in the (Day) Job - Bruno Maddox |author=Crist<U+00ED>n Leach |date=[[2001-05-10]] |work=[[Radio Telef<U+00ED>s <U+00C9>ireann]] |url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2001/0510/dayjob.html |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref>  Within a week Brockman managed to sell the rights to the novel to publishers in an additional eight countries on the strength of the proposal alone.<ref name=prov>{{cite news |title=Agent Provocateur |author=Warren St. John |date=September 1999 |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.09/brockman.html |accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> (Maddox had not yet written even an initial [[manuscript]].)

''My Little Blue Dress'' was published in 2001 by [[Viking Press]], a [[Penguin Group]] [[imprint]]. The novel begins as a [[memoir]] of a hundred-year-old woman, but several chapters later reveals itself to be a spoof of the genre. The protagonist is a fictional Bruno Maddox who is desperately attempting to create a forgery of an old woman's memoir in a single night.<ref>{{cite news| title=Books: A better shot at the Bloke's First Book |author=Brandon Robshaw |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' reprinted by FindArticles.com |date=[[2001-06-02]] |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010602/ai_n14385504 |accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref> Several book reviewers avoided spoiling the novel's satire but others gave away its premise, reasoning that the publisher "reveal[s] all on the book jacket anyway".<ref>{{cite news |title=My Little Blue Dress by Bruno Maddox: Viking, U.S., 2001 |author=Michael Garry Smout |date=January-February 2002 |work=The Barcelona Review |url=http://www.barcelonareview.com/rev/28.htm |accessdate=2007-08-08 }}</ref><ref name=Salon-Bluedress>{{cite news |title="My Little Blue Dress" by Bruno Maddox |author=Maria Russo |date=[[2001-05-17]] |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |url=http://archive.salon.com/books/review/2001/05/21/maddox/ |accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> The novel's intrigue lies in the mysterious reason compelling the fictional Maddox to forge a memoir.<ref name=Salon-Bluedress/>

Critics applauded ''My Little Blue Dress'' but also expressed some reservations. For example, [[Salon.com]]'s Maria Russo cautioned that the novel "is one of those 'don't try this at home' literary experiments that could easily have turned into an unreadable, pretentious disaster", but concluded that Maddox "pulls it off with a kind of fearless pizzazz".<ref name=Salon-Bluedress/>  ''The New York Times''' [[Emily Barton]] conceded that "for all its blunders", Maddox delivers "a winsome and vastly entertaining novel".<ref>{{cite news |title=Enough About Me |author=Emily Barton |date=[[2001-05-27]] |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/05/27/reviews/010527.27bartont.html |accessdate=2007-08-15}}</ref> 

In an interview, Maddox praised [[Bret Easton Ellis]]<U+2019>s 1991 novel ''[[American Psycho]]'', stating that he drew inspiration from protagonist [[Patrick Bateman]]'s long-winded monologues about [[Phil Collins]], restaurants, clothes, and how to remove blood from his carpets.<ref name=NinaBlount/>

In 2001, Maddox promoted his first novel on a joint book tour billed as the "Minor Novelists Tour" with his friend [[William Monahan]], another former ''SPY'' editor, but it was interrupted by the 9/11 attacks. Monahan's ''[[Light House: A Trifle]]'' was also published by a Penguin imprint.<ref>{{cite news |title=Writer's 'trifle' Aims Higher |author=Darcy Cosper |date=[[2001-10-02]] |publisher=''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis<U+00AE> Academic]''}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Authors at Real Art Ways |date=[[2001-09-20]] |publisher=''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' through ''[http://www.lexisnexis.com/universe LexisNexis<U+00AE> Academic]''}}</ref> Several years later, Maddox gave some indication that he was working on a [[film adaptation]] of ''My Little Blue Dress'',<ref name=NYPost1>A note at the end of several of Maddox's book reviews read, "Bruno Maddox is adapting his novel 'My Little Blue Dress' for the screen."

In late 2003, Maddox began to contribute articles regularly to ''[[Travel + Leisure]]''.

In 2006, Maddox began contributing a regular humor column called "Blinded by Science" to ''[[Discover Magazine|Discover]]'' magazine. His writing draws upon his childhood exposure to science; due to his father's career, his family was immersed in science and he was regularly exposed to scientists at social events.<ref name=AboutBBS/> Maddox's first year's columns earned him a nod as a finalist in the 2007 [[National Magazine Award]]s' "Columns and Commentary" category.<ref>{{cite news |title=New York is tops in magazine awards: Takes home five Ellies, the most of any magazine |author=Diego Vasquez |date=[[2007-05-02]] |publisher=''Media Life'' magazine |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/artman2/publish/Magazines_22/New_York_is_tops_in_magazine_awards_11827.asp |accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref>

Maddox's ''Discover'' columns are often criticized; his essays "Stuck in Creationism" and "Fictional Reality", in particular, have been controversial. In 2007, Maddox attended the newly opened [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]] and in his essay "Stuck in Creationism" described the [[Creationist]]s as "fond of science" despite their need to contort "fresh claims from the world of mainstream science" so that they can "fit the framework of creationist belief or [be] discounted with some sort of scientific-sounding explanation".<ref>{{cite news |title=Blinded by Science: Stuck in Creationism |author=Maddox, Bruno |date=[[2007-02-12]] |work=Discover |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/feb/blinded-creation-museum-kentucky }}</ref> In response, Do-While Jones of ''Evolution in the News'' argued that "there is no conflict between Christianity and science" but rather "there is a conflict between Christianity and evolution because there is a conflict between science and the theory of evolution".<ref>{{cite news |title=A Tale of Two Museums |author=Do-While Jones |date=February 2007 |work=Evolution in the News |url=http://www.ridgecrest.ca.us/~do_while/sage/v11i5n.htm |accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref> Later in the year Maddox declared [[science fiction]] obsolete in his essay "Fictional Reality" and was roundly criticized in the [[blogosphere]], most notably by ''[[Scientific American]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s J.R. Minkel. Maddox wrote that "fiction<U+2014>all fiction<U+2014>finally became obsolete as a delivery system for big ideas" as a result of the "scarcity of foreseeable future", citing the decline of author [[Michael Crichton]]'s work as evidence.<ref>{{cite news |title=Blinded by Science: Fictional Reality |author=Maddox, Bruno |date=[[2007-07-20]] |work=Discover |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/aug/blinded-by-science }}</ref> Minkel lambasted Maddox and pointed to author [[Neal Stephenson]]'s cutting-edge work as proof to the contrary, venturing that "science fiction writers can ''dictate'' the future if they have the vim and vision".

==Style==

[[Satire]] is evident in much of Maddox's work, from his years as editor-in-chief for ''[[Spy (magazine)|SPY]]'' magazine to his numerous articles in ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'', and his novel ''My Little Blue Dress''. Maddox's satirical tendencies extend to his interviews and publicity materials.
