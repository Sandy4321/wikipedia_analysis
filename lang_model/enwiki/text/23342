'''''Womanhouse''''' (30 January - 28 February 1972) was a feminist art installation and performance space organized by [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]], co-founders of the California Institute of the Arts ([[CalArts]]) Feminist Art Program. Chicago, Schapiro, their students and women artists from the local community participated. Chicago and Schapiro encouraged their students to use consciousness-raising techniques to generate the content of the exhibition.<ref>[http://as-ap.org/sider/resources.cfm ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

Only women were allowed to view the exhibition on its first day, after which the exhibition was open to all viewers. During the exhibition's duration, it received approximately 10,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite book|title=From Site to Vision: The Woman<U+2019>s Building in Contemporary Culture,|year=2011|publisher=OTIS School of Art and Design|location=Los Angeles|author=Meyer, Laura|editor=Sondra Hale and Terry Wolverton|page=91}}</ref>

== Overview ==

Chicago and Schapiro's teaching is based on group operation where twenty-one young women artists were elected to join this exclusively female class. The way of teaching is circular, "more womb-like," describes Schapiro.<ref>Schapiro, Miriam, ''The Education of Women as Artists: Project Womanhouse'', Art Journal, vol. 31, no.3, Spring, 1972, p. 268-270</ref>  A 47-minute documentary film was made in 1974 about the project by Johanna Demetrakas, and is now available on video. Its European distribution is assured by le peuple qui manque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmm.com/filmCatalog/pages/c324.shtml |title=WOMEN MAKE MOVIES &#124; Womanhouse |publisher=Wmm.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-12}}</ref>

This group of artists found an old run-down mansion and appropriated it into "Womanhouse". Throughout this mansion, contained a variety feminist installations, sculptors, performances, and other forms of art. By transforming a "woman's space" (such as a kitchen) into a space corrupted by radical feminist art truly made a statement.<ref>{{cite book|title=Performance Anthology|date=1989|publisher=Last Gasp Press|location=San Francisco CA}}</ref> Here they spoke out about women issues, as well as criticizing the patriarchy. This helped women artists and architects gain recognition and acknowledgment that their work could be seen on the same level as men. By using a mansion as their chosen setting, this furthered their statement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Amelia|title=The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York NY}}</ref>
