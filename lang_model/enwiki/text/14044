'''''Abies fraseri''''' ('''Fraser Fir''') is a species of [[fir]] native to the mountains of the eastern [[United States]]. It is closely related to ''[[Abies balsamea]]'' (Balsam Fir), of which it has occasionally been treated as a [[subspecies]] (as ''A. balsamea'' subsp. ''fraseri'' (Pursh) E.Murray) or a [[variety (botany)|variety]] (as ''A. balsamea'' var. ''fraseri'' (Pursh) Spach).<ref name=farjon>Farjon, A. (1990). ''Pinaceae.

==Morphology==
[[Image:Abies fraseri2.jpg|left|thumb|Seedlings of Fraser Fir (blue-green, longer needles) and Red Spruce (green, shorter needles)]]
It is a small [[evergreen]] [[conifer]]ous [[tree]] growing to 10<U+2013>15 m (rarely to 25 m) tall with a trunk 40<U+2013>50 cm (rarely to 75 cm) diameter. The crown is conical, with straight branches from horizontal to angled 40<U+00B0> upward from the trunk; it is dense when the tree is young, but becomes more open as it ages. The [[bark]] is thin and smooth, gray-brown with numerous [[resin]] blisters on young trees, becoming fissured and scaly with age. The foliage is strongly [[turpentine]]-scented. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, arranged spirally on the twigs but twisted at the base to spread in two rows; they are 10<U+2013>23 mm long and 2<U+2013>2.2 mm broad, flat and flexible with a rounded or slightly notched tip, dark green to glaucous green above, often with a small patch of [[stoma]]ta near the tip, and with two silvery white stomatal bands on the underside. The [[Conifer cone|cones]] are erect, cylindric, 3.5-7 cm (rarely 8 cm) long and 2.5<U+2013>3 cm (rarely 4 cm) broad, dark purple, turning light brown when mature, with long reflexed green, yellow or pale purple [[bract]] scales, and often resinous. The cones disintegrate when mature at 4<U+2013>6 months old to release the winged seeds.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=liu/><ref name=fna/>

The Balsam Fir variety ''Abies balsamea'' var. ''phanerolepis'' is regarded by some botanists as a natural [[hybrid]] between Balsam Fir and Fraser Fir, as ''Abies <U+00D7> phanerolepis'' (Fernald) Liu.<ref name=liu/>

==Distribution and ecology==
[[Image:Abies fraseri0.jpg|left|thumb|Fraser Fir forest, with many trees killed by [[Balsam woolly adelgid]]]]
It is restricted to the southeastern [[Appalachian Mountains]] in southwestern [[Virginia]], western [[North Carolina]] and eastern [[Tennessee]], where it occurs at high elevations, from 1200 m up to 2,037 m (the summit of [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mount Mitchell]], the highest point in the region). It lives in acidic moist but well-drained sandy loam, and is usually mixed with ''[[Picea rubens]]'' (Red Spruce). Other trees it grows with include ''[[Tsuga caroliniana]]'' (Carolina Hemlock), ''[[Betula alleghaniensis]]'' (Yellow Birch), ''[[Betula papyrifera]]'' (Paper Birch), and ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (Sugar Maple). The climate is cool and moist, with short, cool summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=liu/>

The species severely is damaged by a non-native insect, the [[Balsam woolly adelgid]] (''Adelges piceae''). The insect's introduction and spread led to a rapid decline in Fraser Fir across its range, with over 80% of mature trees having been killed. The rapid regeneration of seedlings with lack of canopy has led to good regrowth of new, healthy young trees where the mature forests once stood. However, when these young trees get old enough for the bark to develop fissures, they will likely be attacked and killed by the adelgids as well. For this reason, the future of the species is still uncertain. The decline of the Fraser Fir in the southern Appalachians has contributed to loss of moss habitat which supports the [[Spruce-fir moss spider]].<ref name=gd/>

==Cultivation and uses==
Fraser Fir is widely used as a [[Christmas tree]]. Its fragrance, appearance, strong twigs, and ability to retain its soft needles for a long time when cut (which do not prick easily when hanging ornaments) make it an excellent choice for this purpose. 

==Etymology==
The species is named after the Scottish botanist [[John Fraser (botanist)|John Fraser]] (1750<U+2013>1811), who made numerous botanical collections in the region.<ref name=liu/> It is sometimes mis-spelled as "Frazer" or "Frazier". In the past, it was also sometimes known as "she-balsam" because resin could be "milked" from its bark blisters,<ref name="isbn0-8078-4851-4">{{cite book |author=Frankenberg, D. |title=Exploring North Carolina's Natural Areas: Parks, Nature Preserves, and Hiking Trails |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-8078-4851-4 |oclc= |doi=}} p343</ref> in contrast to the "he balsam" (Red Spruce) which could not be milked. It has also occasionally been called balsam fir, inviting confusion with ''A. balsamea''.<ref name="isbn0-394-73126-3">{{cite book |author=Sutton, M., & Sutton, A. |title=Eastern forests (Audubon Society Nature Guides) |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |year=1985 |pages= |isbn=0-394-73126-3 |oclc= |doi=}} p363</ref>
