'''Droperidol''' ('''Dropletan'''<U+00AE>, '''Dridol'''<U+00AE> or '''Inapsine'''<U+00AE>) is an [[antidopaminergic]] [[medication|drug]] used as an [[antiemetic]] and antipsychotic. It was discovered at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in [[1961]].

Droperidol is a [[butyrophenone]], and is a potent D<sub>2</sub> (dopamine receptor) antagonist with some [[histamine]] and [[serotonin]] antagonist activity. It has a central antiemetic action and is frequently used in the treatment of [[postoperative nausea and vomiting]] in adult doses as low as 0.625 or 1.25 mg.

It has also been used as an anti-psychotic in doses as high as 10mg i.m.

In 2001, the FDA changed the labeling requirements for droperidol injection, to include a so-called "Black Box Warning", citing concerns of QT prolongation and [[torsades de pointes]]. The evidence for this is disputed, with less than 20 reported cases of ''torsades'' in 30 years and most of those having received doses in excess of 50mg in a 24-hour period. It appears that the QT-prolongation is a dose-related effect and that in low doses, droperidol is not a significant risk.

Further information on Droperidol and the risk of [[torsades de pointes]] has just come. It goes against the FDA recommendations: the authors did not finds a signal case of [[torsades de pointes]] in a careful case review. [Nuttall GA et al. Does low-dose droperidol administration increase the risk

surgical population? Anesthesiology 2007 Oct; 107:531. (Free)

Some practitioners recommend the use of 0.5 mg to 1 mg I.V. for the treatment of vertigo in an otherwise healthy elderly patient who hasn<U+2019>t responded to Epley maneuvers.

==Side effects==
If you experience any of the rare side-effects such as spasms of the face, one should have [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl<U+00AE>) injected into their IV to block the effects of the drug. If one is at home, fast acting Benadryl<U+00AE> dissolving mouth strips should be taken followed by a pill.
