The '' '''Edmee S.''' '' is a [[Chesapeake Bay]] [[log canoe]]. She was built in the [[Tilghman Island]] style from hewn logs by Oliver Duke in the 1930's.  She is one of the last 22 Chesapeake Bay racing log canoes, and is actively raced with a crew of nine to eleven people.  Her original name was ''Cecilia Mae'', but was renamed for Edmee S. Combs, whose husband funded the restoration.  The hull was covered with [[fiberglass]] during the restoration. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marylandhistoricaltrust.net/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=907&COUNTY=Talbot&FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Talbot|title=Maryland Historical Trust|date=2008-07-18|work= EDMEE S.
