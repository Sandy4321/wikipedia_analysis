The '''Freedom Monument''' ({{lang-lv|Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas piemineklis}}) is a memorial located in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]] honouring soldiers killed during the [[Latvian War of Independence]] (1918<U+2013>1920). It is considered an important symbol of the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of Latvia.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> Unveiled in 1935, the {{convert|42|m|ft|0|sing=on}} high monument of [[granite]], [[travertine]], and [[copper]] often serves as the focal point of public gatherings and official ceremonies in Riga.

The sculptures and [[bas-relief]]s of the monument, arranged in thirteen groups, depict Latvian culture and history. The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other, decreasing in size towards the top, completed by a {{convert|19|m|ft|0|sing=on}} high travertine column bearing the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars. The concept for the monument first emerged in the early 1920s when the Latvian Prime Minister, [[Zigfr<U+012B>ds Anna Meierovics]], ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a "memorial column". After several contests the monument was finally built at the beginning of the 1930s according to the scheme "Shine like a star!" submitted by Latvian sculptor [[K<U+0101>rlis Z<U+0101>le]]. Construction works were financed by private donations.

Following [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940]] Latvia was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and the Freedom Monument was considered for demolition, but no such move was carried out. Soviet sculptor [[Vera Mukhina]] (who was born in Riga) is sometimes credited for rescuing the monument, because she considered it to be of the high artistic value. Soviet propaganda attempted to alter the symbolic meaning of the monument to better fit with Communist ideology, but it remained a symbol of national independence to the general public. Indeed, on June 14, 1987 about 5,000 people gathered at the monument to commemorate the victims of the Soviet regime and to lay flowers. This rally renewed the national independence movement, which culminated three years later in the re-establishment of Latvian sovereignty after the fall of the Soviet regime.

The sculptures and [[bas-relief]]s of the Freedom Monument, arranged in thirteen groups, depict Latvian culture and history.<ref name="vecriga"/> The core of the monument is composed of tetragonal shapes on top of each other, decreasing in size towards the top. A red granite staircase of ten steps, {{convert|1.8|m|ft|spell=us}} in height, winds around the base of the monument between two travertine reliefs {{convert|1.7|m|ft|spell=us}} high and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|spell=us}} wide, "[[Latvian riflemen]]" (13; {{lang-lv|Latvju str<U+0113>lnieki}}) and "Latvian people: the Singers" (14; {{lang-lv|Latvju tauta <U+2013> dzied<U+0101>t<U+0101>ja}}), which decorate its {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=us}} thick sides.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> Two additional steps form a round platform, which is {{convert|28|m|ft|spell=us}} in diameter, on which the whole monument stands. At the front of the monument this platform forms a rectangle, which is used for ceremonial proposes. The base of the monument, also made of red granite, is formed by two rectangular blocks: the lower one is a monolithic {{convert|3.5|m|ft|spell=us}} high, {{convert|9.2|m|ft|spell=us}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft|spell=us}} long, while the smaller upper block is {{convert|3.5|m|ft|spell=us}} high, {{convert|8.5|m|ft|spell=us}} wide and {{convert|10|m|ft|spell=us}} long and has round niches in its corners, each containing a sculptural group of three figures. Its sides are also paneled with travertine.<ref name="silins"/>
On the front of the monument, in between the groups "Work" (10; depicting a fisherman, a craftsman and a farmer, who stands in the middle holding a scythe decorated with oak leaves and acorns to symbolize strength and manhood) and "Guards of the Fatherland" (9; depicting an ancient Latvian warrior standing between two kneeling modern soldiers), a dedication by the Latvian writer [[K<U+0101>rlis Skalbe]] is inscribed on one of the travertine panels: ''For Fatherland and Freedom'' (6; {{lang-lv|T<U+0113>vzemei un Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bai}}).<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/>
On the sides the travertine panels bear two reliefs: "1905" (7; {{lang-lv|1905.gads}} in reference to the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]), and "The Battle against the [[West Russian Volunteer Army|Bermontians]] on the Iron Bridge" (8; {{lang-lv|C<U+012B><U+0146>a pret bermontie<U+0161>iem uz Dzelzs tilta}}, referring to the decisive battle in [[Riga]] during the [[Latvian War of Independence]]). On the back of the monument are another two sculptural groups: "Family" (12; {{lang-lv|<U+0122>imene}}) (a mother standing between her two children) and "Scholars" (11; {{lang-lv|Gara darbinieki}}).<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> On the red granite base there is yet another rectangular block, {{convert|6|m|ft|spell=us}} high and wide, and {{convert|7.5|m|ft|spell=us}} long, encircled by four 5.5<U+2013>6&nbsp;meters (18<U+2013>20&nbsp;ft) high gray granite sculptural groups: "[[Latvia]]" (2; {{lang-lv|Latvija}}), "[[L<U+0101><U+010D>pl<U+0113>sis]]" (3; {{lang-en|Bear-Slayer}}, an epic Latvian [[folk hero]]), "Vaidelotis" (5; a [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Paganism|pagan]] priest) and "Chain breakers" (4; {{lang-lv|Va<U+017E>u r<U+0101>v<U+0113>ji}}) (three chained men trying to break free from their chains).<ref name="silins"/>

The topmost block serves also as the foundation for the {{convert|19|m|ft|spell=us}} high monolithic travertine column, which is {{convert|2.5|m|ft|spell=us}} by {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=us}} at the base. To the front and rear a line of glass runs along the middle of the column.<ref name="silins"/> The column is topped by a [[copper]] figure of Liberty (1), which is {{convert|9|m|ft|spell=us}} tall and in the form of a woman lifting three [[Gilding|gilded]] stars, symbolizing the [[Constitution of Latvia|constitutional]] districts of Latvia: [[Vidzeme]], [[Latgale]] and [[Courland]].<ref name="endex">[http://www.endex.com/gf/buildings/liberty/worldstatues/SOLRiga/solriga.htm Statue of Liberty]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}, retrieved: 2007-02-07</ref> The whole monument is built around a frame of [[reinforced concrete]] and was originally fastened together with [[lead]], [[bronze]] cables and [[lime mortar]].<ref name="silins"/> However, some of the original materials were replaced with polyurethane filler during restoration.<ref name="sidraba"/> There is a room inside the Monument, accessed through a door in its rear side, which contains a staircase leading upwards in the Monument that is used for electrical installation and to provide access to the sewerage. The room cannot be accessed by the public and is used mainly as storage, however it has been proposed that the room could be redesigned forming a small exhibition, which would be used to introduce foreign officials visiting Latvia with the history of the Monument after the flower-laying ceremony.<ref>{{lv icon}} [http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/320012-iecere_atvert_brivibas_pieminekla_iekstelpu Iecere atv<U+0113>rt Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas pieminek<U+013C>a iek<U+0161>telpu] Tvnet.lv (LNT) 2008-02-20, retrieved on 2008-02-20</ref>

Situated in the park near the monument to the south is the National Opera House with a flower garden and a fountain in front of it.<ref name="rigaenc">{{lv icon}} Enciklop<U+0113>dija "R<U+012B>ga" R<U+012B>ga 1988 Galven<U+0101> enciklop<U+0113>diju redakcija (No ISBN)</ref> Opposite the opera house on the western part of plaza near the old town, is a small caf<U+00E9> and the Laima clock. The clock was set up in 1924, and in 1936 it was decorated with an advertisement for the Latvian [[confectionery]] brand "[[Laima (confectioner)|Laima]]", from which it took its name; it is a popular meeting spot.<ref>{{lv icon}} [http://www.building.lv/readnews.php?news_id=91439 "Laimas" pulkstenim veiks kosm<U+0113>tisko remontu], retrieved on 2007-04-20</ref>

Originally it was planned that an elliptical plaza would be built around the foot of the monument, enclosed by a granite wall {{convert|1.6|m|ft|spell=us}} high, with benches placed inside it, while a [[Hedge (barrier)|hedge]] of [[thuja]]s was to be planted around the outside. This project was however not carried out in the 1930s. The idea was reconsidered in the 1980s but shelved again.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija">{{lv icon}} "Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija" (I s<U+0113>jums) R<U+012B>ga 2002 SIA "Val<U+0113>rija Beloko<U+0146>a izdevniec<U+012B>ba" ISBN 9984-9482-1-8</ref>

==Construction==

The idea of building a memorial to honor soldiers [[killed in action]] during the [[Latvian War of Independence]] first emerged in the early 1920s. On July 27, 1922, the [[Prime Minister of Latvia]], [[Zigfr<U+012B>ds Anna Meierovics]], ordered rules to be drawn up for a contest for designs of a "memorial column". The winner of this contest was a scheme proposing a column {{convert|27|m|ft|spell=us}} tall with [[relief]]s of the official symbols of Latvia and [[bas-relief]]s of [[Kri<U+0161>j<U+0101>nis Barons]] and [[Atis Kronvalds]]. It was later rejected after a protest from 57 artists.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> In October 1923, a new contest was announced, using for the first time the term "Freedom Monument". The contest ended with two winners, and a new closed contest was announced in March 1925, but, due to disagreement within the jury, there was no result.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/>

Finally in October 1929, the last contest was announced. The winner was the design "Shine like a star!" ({{lang-lv|"Mirdzi k<U+0101> zvaigzne!"}}) by sculptor K<U+0101>rlis Z<U+0101>le, who had had success in the previous contests as well. After minor corrections made by the author and supervising architect [[Ernests <U+0160>t<U+0101>lbergs]], construction began on November 18, 1931.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> Financed by private donations, the monument was erected by the entrance to the old town, in the same place where the previous central monument of Riga, a bronze [[equestrian statue]] of the Russian Emperor [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], had stood.<ref name="latav5506"/> It was calculated in 1935, the year when the monument was unveiled, that in four years of construction 308,000 man-hours were required to work the stone materials alone: 130 years would have been required if one person were to carry out the work using the most advanced equipment of the time. The total weight of materials used was about 2,500 [[ton]]s: such a quantity of materials would have required about 200 freight cars if transported by railway.<ref name="silins"/>

==Restoration==

[[Image:Freedom_Monument_Riga_closeup.jpg|thumb|left|A closeup view of the copper figure of Liberty lifting three gilded stars.]]The monument is endangered by the climate (which has caused damage by frost and [[acid rain|rain]]) and by air pollution.<ref name="mez"/> Although in 1990 the area around the monument was pedestrianized, there are still three streets carrying traffic around it.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> High concentrations of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] have been recorded near the monument, which in combination with water cause corrosion of the fabric of the monument.<ref name="mez"/> In addition, water has caused cracking of the reinforced concrete core and rusting of its steel reinforcements and the fastenings of the monument, which also have been worn out by constant vibrations caused by traffic.<ref name="sidraba"/>  The porous travertine has gradually crumbled over time and its pores have filled with soot and particles of sand, causing it to blacken and providing a habitat for small organisms, such as [[moss]] and [[lichen]]s.<ref name="mez">[http://www.arcchip.cz/w06/w06_mezinskis.pdf Environmental Influences on Cultural Heritage of Latvia] by G. Mezinskis, L. Krage & M. Dzenis, Faculty of Materials Science and Applied Chemistry, Riga Technical University</ref> Irregular maintenance and the unskillful performance of restoration work have also contributed to the weathering of the monument. To prevent its further decay some of the fastenings were replaced with polyurethane filler and water repellent was applied to the monument during the restoration in 2001. It was also determined that maintenance should be carried out every 2 years.<ref name="sidraba">[http://www.arcchip.cz/w10/w10_sidraba.pdf New Materials for Conservation of Stone Monuments in Latvia] by Inese Sidraba, Centre for Conservation and Restoration of Stone Materials, Institute of Silicate Materials, Riga Technical University</ref>

The monument was restored twice during the Soviet era (1962 and 1980<U+2013>1981). In keeping with tradition the restorations and maintenance after the renewal of Latvia's independence are financed partly by private donations. The monument underwent major restoration in 1998<U+2013>2001.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> During this restoration the statue of Liberty and its stars were cleaned, restored and gilded anew.<ref name="delfi">{{lv icon}} [http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/article.php?id=13851425 Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas pieminek<U+013C>a atjauno<U+0161>anas darbus s<U+0101>ks pirmdien] Delfi.lv (Leta) 2006-03-10, retrieved on 2007-05-11</ref> The monument was formally re-opened on July 24, 2001.<ref>{{lv icon}} [http://notikumi.delfi.lv/archive/article.php?id=1473143&ndate=993589200&categoryID=8529646 Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas pieminek<U+013C>a atkl<U+0101><U+0161>an<U+0101> skan<U+0113>s Zigmara Liepi<U+0146>a kant<U+0101>te] Delfi.lv (BNS) 2001-06-21, retrieved on 2007-02-15</ref> The staircase, column, base and inside of the monument were restored, and the stone materials were cleaned and re-sealed. The supports of the monument were fixed to prevent subsidence. Although the restorers said at the time that the monument would withstand a hundred years without another major restoration, it was discovered a few years later that the [[gilding]] of the stars was damaged, due to the restoration technique used. The stars were restored again during maintenance and restoration in 2006; however, this restoration was rushed and there is no warranty of its quality.<ref>{{lv icon}} [http://www.vietas.lv/index.php?p=10&id=816 Apzelt<U+012B> bez garantijas] Vietas.lv (Neatkar<U+012B>ga) 2006-04-20, retrieved on 2007-05-11</ref>

==Guard of Honor==
[[Image:Monument of freedom honour guard.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The guard of honor at the foot of the Freedom Monument]]

The [[honor guard|guard of honor]] was present from the unveiling of the monument until 1940, when it was removed shortly after the occupation of Latvia.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> It was renewed on November 11, 1992.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija">"Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija" (I s<U+0113>jums) R<U+012B>ga 2002 SIA "Val<U+0113>rija Beloko<U+0146>a izdevniec<U+012B>ba" ISBN 9984-9482-1-8</ref> The guards are soldiers of The Company of Guard of Honor of the Headquarters Battalion of the [[Military of Latvia|National Armed Forces]] ({{lang-lv|Nacion<U+0101>lo Bru<U+0146>oto sp<U+0113>ku <U+0160>t<U+0101>ba bataljona Goda sardzes rota}}).<ref name="dialogi"/> The guard is not required to be on duty in bad weather conditions and if the temperatures are below {{convert|-10|<U+00B0>C|lk=on}} or above {{convert|25|<U+00B0>C}}.<ref name="staburags"/><ref name="bdaug"/> The guards work in two weekly shifts, with three or four pairs of guards taking over from each other hourly in a ceremony commanded by the chief of the guard.<ref name="staburags"/><ref name="bdaug"/> Besides them there also are two watchmen in each shift, who look out for the safety of the guards of honor.<ref name="bdaug"/>

==Political significance==
After the end of World War II, there were plans to demolish the monument, although little written evidence is available to historians and research is largely based on verbal testimony.<ref name="latav5506"/> On September 29, 1949 (although according to verbal testimony, the issue was first raised as early as October 1944) the Council of People's Commissars of the [[Latvian SSR]] proposed the restoration of the statue of the Russian Emperor [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. [[Image:Riga peter the great statue.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The Freedom Monument replaced a statue of the Russian Emperor [[Peter the Great]]]] While they did not expressly call for the demolition of the Freedom Monument, the only way to restore the statue to its original position would have been to tear down the monument. The result of the debate is unrecorded, but since the monument still stands the proposition was presumably rejected.<ref name="latav5506"/> The Soviet sculptor [[Vera Mukhina]] (1889<U+2013>1953; designer of the monumental sculpture ''[[Worker and Kolkhoz Woman]]'') is sometimes credited with the rescue of the monument, although there is no written evidence to support the fact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rigacase.com/|title=rigacase.com|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> According to her son, she took part in a meeting where the fate of the monument was discussed, at which her opinion, as reported by her son, was that the monument was of very high artistic value and that its demolition might hurt the most sacred feelings of the Latvian people.<ref name="latav5506"/>

The Freedom Monument remained, but its symbolism was reinterpreted. The three stars were said to stand for the newly created Baltic [[List of Soviet Republics|Soviet Republics]] <U+2013> [[Estonian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], and [[Lithuanian SSR]] <U+2013> held aloft by [[Mother Motherland|Mother Russia]] and the monument was said to have been erected after [[World War II]] as a sign of popular gratitude toward the [[Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] for the liberation of the [[Baltic States]].<ref name="silins">''[http://latvians.com/en/Reading/BrivibasPiemineklis/envelope-bp.php?./bp-00-intro.ssi Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas Piemineklis]'', by J<U+0101>nis Sili<U+0146><U+0161>, Riga : Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas Pieminek<U+013C>a Komitejas Izdevums (The Freedom Monument Committee), 1935, retrieved on 2007-02-07</ref><ref name="latav5506"/> In the middle of 1963, when the issue of demolition was raised again, it was decided that the destruction of a structure of such artistic and historic value, the building of which had been funded by donations of the residents of Latvia, would only cause deep indignation, which in turn would cause tension in society.<ref name="latav5506">{{lv icon}} [http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/73/articles/73539 Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas pieminekli uzspridzin<U+0101>t, P<U+0113>teri I viet<U+0101><U+2026>] Apollo.lv (Latvijas Av<U+012B>ze) 2006-05-05, retrieved on 2007-02-17</ref> Over time the misinterpretation of symbolism also was toned down and by 1988 the monument was said, with somewhat more accuracy, to have been built to ''"celebrate the liberation from bondage of the [[autocracy]] of the [[tsar]] and [[Baltic Germans|German barons]]"'', although withholding the fact that the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Red Latvian Riflemen]] were also adversaries in the [[Latvian War of Independence]].<ref name="rigaenc">{{lv icon}} Enciklop<U+0113>dija "R<U+012B>ga" R<U+012B>ga 1988 Galven<U+0101> enciklop<U+0113>diju redakcija (No ISBN)</ref><ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/>

Despite the Soviet government<U+2019>s efforts, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people rallied to commemorate the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|victims of Soviet deportations]].<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/> This event, organized by the [[human rights]] group [[Helsinki-86]], was the first time after the Soviet occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities.<ref name="Latvijas Enciklop<U+0113>dija"/><ref> [http://www.regnum.ru/english/746649.html George Bush: NATO will defend freedom worldwide] Regnum News Agency, 2006-11-29, retrieved: 2007-02-07</ref> In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place. Helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year to commemorate the anniversary of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], at which [[Riot control|the crowd was dispersed]] using jets of water.<ref>{{lv icon}} [http://vip.latnet.lv/lpra/helsinkieshi.htm "Helsinki <U+2013> 86" r<U+012B>kot<U+0101>s akcijas 1987. gad<U+0101>], retrieved: 2007-03-19</ref> Yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to more than half a million participants (about one quarter of Latvia's population) and three years later, on May 4, 1990, the re-establishment of the independence of Latvia was declared.<ref>{{lv icon}} ''L<U+016B>zums.

Since the re-establishment of independence the monument has become a focal point for a variety of events.

In 1998 the event drew the attention of the foreign mass media and in the following year the [[Russia|Russian government]] condemned the event as a glorification of [[Nazism]].<ref name="zunda">{{lv icon}} [http://vip.latnet.lv/LPRA/zunda2004.htm 16. marts Latvie<U+0161>u le<U+0123>iona v<U+0113>stures kontekst<U+0101> by Antonijs Zunda, professor of Latvian University], retrieved on 2006-03-16</ref> The event evolved into a political conflict between Latvians and Russians, posing a threat to public safety.<ref name="delfi"/><ref>{{lv icon}} [http://vip.latnet.lv/lpra/16m2005.htm Provok<U+0101>cija pie Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas pieminek<U+013C>a] Archived press coverage regarding 2005-03-16 (Neatkar<U+012B>g<U+0101>; Diena; Latvijas Av<U+012B>ze), retrieved on 2007-05-10</ref>

The Latvian government took a number of steps in order to try to bring the situation under control, and in 2006 not only were the events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by [[Riga]] city council, for restoration.<ref name="delfi"/><ref name="prescover6"/> The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work.<ref>{{lv icon}} [http://www.politika.lv/index.php?id=9095 Br<U+012B>v<U+012B>bas pieminek<U+013C>a koka m<U+0113>tel<U+012B>tis] Politika.lv 2006-03-14, retrieved 2007-03-18</ref> Therefore the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech.
