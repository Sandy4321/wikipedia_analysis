The occupiers looted or destroyed much of Poland's cultural heritage, while persecuting and killing members of the Polish [[intelligentsia|cultural elite]]. Most [[education in Poland|Polish schools]] were closed, and those that remained open saw their [[Curriculum|curricula]] altered significantly.

Nevertheless, underground organizations and individuals <U+2013> in particular the [[Polish Underground State]] <U+2013> saved much of Poland's most valuable cultural heritage, and worked to salvage as many cultural institutions and artifacts as possible. The [[Catholic Church]] and wealthy individuals contributed to the survival of some artists and their works. Despite severe retribution by the Nazis and Soviets, Polish underground cultural activities, including publications, concerts, live theater, education, and academic research, continued throughout the war.

On 1&nbsp;September 1939, [[German invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]], initiating [[World War II]], and on 17&nbsp;September, pursuant to the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Poland was invaded by the Soviet Union]]. Subsequently [[Partitions of Poland#.22Fourth Partition.22|Poland was divided]] between these two powers, and remained under [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|their occupation]] for most of the war.<ref name="Raack58">Raack 1995 p.&nbsp;58</ref> By 1&nbsp;October, Germany and the Soviet Union had completely overrun Poland, although the Polish government never formally surrendered, and the [[Polish Underground State]], subordinate to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], was soon formed. On 8 October, Nazi Germany [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed the western areas of pre-war Poland]] and established the [[Generalgouvernement]] in the remainder of the occupied area. The Soviet Union had to temporarily give up the gains it made in 1939 due to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941]], but [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|permanently re-annexed them]] after [[Lvov<U+2013>Sandomierz Offensive|winning them back in mid-1944]]. Over the course of the war, Poland lost over 20% of its pre-war population amid an occupation that marked the end of the [[Second Polish Republic]].<ref name="Piotrowski_295">{{Harvnb|Piotrowski|1997|p=295}}</ref>

====Policy====
Germany's policy toward the Polish nation and its culture evolved during the course of the war. Many German officials and military officers were initially not given any clear guidelines on the treatment of Polish cultural institutions, but this quickly changed.<ref name=Madajczyk127-129>{{Harvnb|Madajczyk|1970|pp=127<U+2013>129}}</ref> Immediately after the [[German invasion of Poland]], in September 1939, the Nazi German government implemented the first stages (the "small plan") of ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''.<ref>{{de icon}} Madajczyk, Czes<U+0142>aw, (1980), "Die Besatzungssysteme der Achsenm<U+00E4>chte: Versuch einer komparatistischen Analyse."

Much of the German policy on Polish culture was formulated during a meeting between the governor of the General Government, [[Hans Frank]], and Nazi Minister of Propaganda [[Joseph Goebbels]], at [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]] on 31&nbsp;October 1939.

The only Polish-language newspaper published in occupied Poland was also closed, and the arrests of Polish intellectuals began.<ref name=Madajczyk127-129/>

In March 1940, all cultural activities came under the control of the General Government's Department of People's Education and Propaganda (''Abteilung f<U+00FC>r Volksaufkl<U+00E4>rung und Propaganda''), whose name was changed a year later to the "Chief Propaganda Department" (''Hauptabteilung Propaganda'').<ref name=Czocher/> Further directives issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by Frank and Goebbels during the previous autumn.<ref name=Madajczyk130>{{Harvnb|Madajczyk|1970|p=130}}</ref> One of the Department's earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most "primitive" of cultural activities without the Department's prior approval.<ref name=Madajczyk127-129/><ref name=Czocher/> Spectacles of "low quality", including those of an [[erotic]] or [[pornographic]] nature, were however an exception <U+2013> those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the "real" Polish culture as well as to create the impression that Germany was not preventing Poles from expressing themselves.<ref name=Madajczyk130/> German propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized "Polish" performances that were specifically designed to be boring or pornographic, and presented them as typical Polish cultural activities.<ref name=Madajczyk137>{{Harvnb|Madajczyk|1970|p=137}}</ref> Polish-German cooperation in cultural matters, such as joint public performances, was strictly prohibited.<ref name=Madajczyk130-132>{{Harvnb|Madajczyk|1970|pp=130<U+2013>132}}</ref> Meanwhile, a compulsory registration scheme for writers and artists was introduced in August 1940.<ref name=Madajczyk127-129/> Then, in October, the printing of new Polish-language books was prohibited; existing titles were censored, and often confiscated and withdrawn.<ref name=Madajczyk127-129/>

In 1941, German policy evolved further, calling for the complete destruction of the [[Poles|Polish people]], whom the Nazis' regarded as "subhuman" (''[[Untermensch]]en''). Within ten to twenty years, the Polish territories under German occupation were to be entirely cleared of ethnic Poles and settled by German [[colonialism|colonists]].<ref name=aredzik/><ref name="Volk">{{Citation|first=Volker R.|last=Berghahn|title=Germans and Poles 1871<U+2013>1945|journal=Germany and Eastern Europe: Cultural Identities and Cultural Differences|publisher=Rodopi|year=1999}}</ref>
The policy was relaxed somewhat in the final years of occupation (1943<U+2013>44), in view of German military defeats and the approaching [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]].<ref name=Madajczyk133-134>{{Harvnb|Madajczyk|1970|pp=133<U+2013>134}}</ref> The Germans hoped that a more lenient cultural policy would lessen unrest and weaken the Polish Resistance.<ref name=Madajczyk132-133/> Poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported German propaganda and indoctrination, such as the newly created [[Chopin]] museum, which emphasized the composer's invented German roots.<ref name=Madajczyk132-133/> Restrictions on education, theater and music performances were eased.<ref name=Madajczyk132-133/>

Given that the [[Second Polish Republic]] was a [[Historical demographics of Poland#Second Polish Republic (1918-1939)|multicultural state]],<ref name="Davies">Davies 2005, p.&nbsp;299</ref> German policies and propaganda also sought to create and encourage conflicts between ethnic groups, fueling tension between Poles and Jews, and between Poles and Ukrainians.<ref name=Madajczyk169-170>{{Harvnb|Madajczyk|1970|pp=169<U+2013>170}}</ref><ref name=Madajczyk171-173>{{Harvnb|Madajczyk|1970|pp=171<U+2013>173}}</ref> In [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], the Germans forced Jews to help destroy a monument to a Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko<U+015B>ciuszko]], and filmed them committing the act.

{{details|Education in Poland during World War II}}
In response to the German closure and censorship of Polish schools, resistance among teachers led almost immediately to the creation of [[Education in Poland during World War II|large-scale underground educational activities]]. Most notably, the [[Secret Teaching Organization]] (''Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska, TON'') was created as early as in October 1939.<ref>{{pl icon}} [http://portalwiedzy.onet.pl/68338,,,,tajna_organizacja_nauczycielska,haslo.html Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska] in WIEM Encyklopedia.

==Influence on postwar culture==
{{seealso|Cultural representations of the Warsaw Uprising}}
The wartime attempts to destroy Polish culture may have strengthened it instead. [[Norman Davies]] wrote in ''[[God's Playground]]'': "In 1945, as a prize for untold sacrifices, the attachment of the survivors to their native culture was stronger than ever before."<ref name="GP">Davies 2005, p.&nbsp;174</ref> Similarly, close-knit underground classes, from primary schools to universities, were renowned for their high quality, due in large part to the lower ratio of students to teachers.<ref name="Salm21121">{{Harvnb|Salmonowicz|1994|pp=211, 221}}</ref> The resulting culture was, however, different from the [[culture of interwar Poland]] for a number of reasons. The [[Holocaust in Poland|destruction of Poland's Jewish community]], [[territorial changes of Poland after World War II|Poland's postwar territorial changes]], and [[Human migration#World War II|postwar migrations]] left Poland without its historic ethnic minorities. The multicultural nation was no more.<ref>Haltof 2002, p.&nbsp;223</ref>

[[Image:Rozstrzelanie V - execution V - Wr<U+00F3>blewski.jpg|thumb|upright|''Rozstrzelanie V'' (Execution by Firing Squad, V) by [[Andrzej Wr<U+00F3>blewski]], portraying one of the horrors of the [[German occupation of Poland|German occupation]]]]

The experience of World War II placed its stamp on a [[generation]] of Polish artists that became known as the "[[Generation of Columbuses]]". The term denotes an entire generation of Poles, born soon after Poland regained independence in 1918, whose adolescence was marked by World War II. In their art, they "discovered a new Poland"<U+2013>one forever changed by the atrocities of World War II and the ensuing [[history of Poland (1945-1989)|creation of a communist Poland]].<ref>Cornis-Pope, Neubauer 2004, p.&nbsp;146</ref><ref>Klimaszewski 1984, p.&nbsp;343</ref><ref>Haltof 2002, p.&nbsp;76</ref>

Over the years, nearly three-quarters of the Polish people have emphasized the importance of World War II to the Polish national identity.<ref name="KR">Ruchniewicz, Krzysztof (2007, Sept. 5) [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2007-09-05-ruchniewicz-en.html The memory of World War II in Poland], Eurozine. Retrieved on March 26, 2008</ref> Many Polish works of art created since the war have centered around events of the war. Books by [[Tadeusz Borowski]], [[Adolf Rudnicki]], [[Henryk Grynberg]], [[Miron Bia<U+0142>oszewski]], [[Hanna Krall]] and others; films, including those by [[Andrzej Wajda]] (''[[A Generation]]'', ''[[Kana<U+0142> (film)|Kana<U+0142>]]'', ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'', ''[[Lotna]]'', ''[[A Love in Germany]]'', ''[[Korczak (film)|Korczak]]'', ''[[Katy<U+0144> (film)|Katy<U+0144>]]''); TV series (''[[Czterej pancerni i pies|Four Tank Men and a Dog]]'' and ''[[Stawka wi<U+0119>ksza ni<U+017C> <U+017C>ycie|Stakes Larger than Life]]''); music (''[[Powstanie Warszawskie (album)|Powstanie Warszawskie]]''); and even [[comic book]]s<U+2013>all of these diverse works have reflected those times. Polish historian [[Tomasz Szarota]] wrote in 1996:{{quote|Educational and training programs place special emphasis on the World War II period and on the occupation. Events and individuals connected with the war are ubiquitous on TV, on radio and in the print media. The theme remains an important element in literature and learning, in film, theater and the fine arts. Not to mention that politicians constantly make use of it. Probably no other country marks anniversaries related to the events of World War II so often or so solemnly.<ref name="KR"/>}}
