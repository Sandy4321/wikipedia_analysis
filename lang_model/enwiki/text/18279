==Background and composition==
"Carmen" was written by Del Rey and [[Justin Parker]], and produced by [[Emile Haynie]] with additional production by [[Jeff Bhasker]].<ref>'''Born to Die''' CD Cover Outer Lines.</ref> When Del Rey was interviewed by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', she stated that the song is a "cautionary tale of a doomed woman who sells her body on the streets [...]" She carried on saying "[Carmen] is a song I can't say too much about because it's so close to my heart. It's the song on the record I relate to most closely. It's set partly in Coney Island, a place that's been important to me throughout my New York City career."<ref name="songfacts">http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=25173</ref>{{vc|date=August 2013}}

According to Del Rey, she said the song feature's a main protagonist who is a 17-year old,<ref name="songfacts"/> who suffers from substance abuse, which is similar to Del Rey's drinking addiction she had when she was in her late teens.<ref name="songfacts"/>

==Critical reception==
"Carmen" was acclaimed by most critics for its ability to tell a story and haunt with its intense lyrics of the downside to fame. Noted as a cautionary hint of any downside to such a debauched lifestyle that Del Rey portrays on her album, Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' describes the song as a metaphor used by Del Rey for her "synthetic life experience."<ref>{{cite web|author=Andy Gill |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-lana-del-rey-born-to-die-interscopepolydor-6295631.html |title=Album: Lana Del Rey, Born to Die (Interscope/Polydor) - Reviews - Music |publisher=The Independent |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref> Alex Denney of ''[[NME]]'' described the song as "a winner" with Del Rey<U+2019>s richly suggestive tones conjuring the ghosts of Lauren Bacall<U+2019>s classic femme-fatales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/lana-del-rey/12692 |title=NME Album Reviews - Lana Del Rey - 'Born To Die'|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=2012-02-03 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref> While reviewing the album and describing the song as the point where "things start to pick-up," John Capone of ''Prefix Magazine'' described the song as a "three-Xanax-and-gin-martini-cocktail broken-hearted baroque ballad."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/lana-del-rey/born-to-die/61168/ |title=Album Review: Lana Del Rey - Born to Die &#124; Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date=2012-02-01 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref> Angela Okhumoya of ''Addictmusic'' showed appreciation for Del Rey's writing abilities on "Carmen" stating that it is "better than most of her contemporaries."<ref>{{cite web|author=February 20, 2012 |url=http://www.addictmusic.co.uk/reviews/album-reviews/lana-del-rey-born-to-die-polydorinterscope/ |title=Lana Del Rey <U+2013> Born To Die &#124; Album Review |publisher=Addict Music |date=2012-02-20 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref> Dom Gourlay of ''[[Contactmusic]]'' gave the song a positive review, stating "You want hip-hop beats?

On February 27, 2012, Del Rey revealed through her Facebook page that she just finished editing the music video for "Carmen".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/lanadelrey/posts/336330939742696 |title=Finishing editing... |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-02-19 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}</ref>{{vc|date=August 2013}} The singer premiered the music video on April 21, 2012. The video opens with Instagram-style snapshots of New York City, spliced together with scenes of old [[Hollywood]] [[paparazzi]], a rose, and shots of Lana herself. Once the song begins, we see a dressed woman working a pole, then Lana on a city porch. The song goes on to feature black and white photo stills, animated food scenes, Lana riding the back of a motorcycle operated by the model Josh Rachlin and multiple references to drugs and troubled youth. In one scene, Lana is behind the camera interviewing Rachlin, asking him about his dream girl and giggling. The video ends with the Erik Satie's song "Gymnop<U+00E9>die No.1." and a woman dancing in a field until the word <U+201C>fin<U+201D> graces the screen.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
