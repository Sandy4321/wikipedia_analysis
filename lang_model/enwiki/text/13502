'''''Ghosts''''' is the fourth album by the [[Denton, Texas]] [[punk rock]] band [[The Marked Men]], released May 16, 2006 by [[Swami Records]]. Like their previous albums, the band recorded, produced, and mixed it themselves in a converted shed in their hometown of Denton.<ref name="yancey">{{cite web|last=Yancey|first=Bryne|title = Review: ''Ghosts''|publisher = [[punknews.org]]|date = 2009-02-20|url = http://www.punknews.org/review/8066|accessdate = 2009-03-14}}</ref>

The album received positive reviews from critics, with most noting that its speed and the brevity of most of the songs necessitated repeat listens in order to notice its more intricate qualities. Bryne Yancey of [[Punknews.org]] remarked that "there's so much going on underneath the surface of these songs that once all the intricacies hit your ears, it might cause you to wonder aloud if anyone else who's not in the band notices them. Sure, anyone can ''listen'' to the Marked Men, but to ''hear'' them is a completely different experience."<ref name="yancey"/> Luke Jackson of ''[[Alternative Press]]'' noted "To be perfectly honest, ''Ghosts'' won't grab you at first. Sure, they're a band playing loud, fast, and exceptionally tight, but the pop-punk market has been so oversaturated that it takes a lot for a band like Marked Men to be anything but white noise. However, once you hit your fourth or fifth listen, the hooks will finally start to sink in."<ref name="jaxon"/>
