'''BS 8888''' is the [[British Standards|British standard]] developed by the [[BSI Group]] for technical product documentation, geometric product specification, geometric tolerance specification and engineering drawings.<ref>http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-News-Content/Sectors/ICT--Telecommunications/Newly-Revised-BS-88882006-Technical-Product-Specification/</ref>

==History==
[[BS 308]] was formally the standard for engineering drawing since 1927. Over a period of 73 years it was expanded and edited until its withdrawal in 2000. The [[BSI Group]], who produced the standard, played an important role in the development of the international standard on technical specification in conjunction with the ISO. In 2000, the [[BS 308]] was retired and replaced by the updated BS 8888.

===2008 update===
A significant change in the 2008 revision is that there is no longer a requirement to state whether specifications have been toleranced in accordance with either the Principle of Independency or the Principle of Dependency.

==Purpose==
BS 8888 performs three fundamental tasks:
*Unifying all the ISO standards applicable to technical specification;
*Giving an index of ISO standards involved with different principles of technical product specification (TPS);
*Providing BSI with a platform for further explanatory commentary where necessary.
