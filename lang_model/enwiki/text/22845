== Professional career ==
From [[1990]] to 1991 Borg was an [[editorial]] writer for the newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''.  Following the centre-right parties' victory in the [[Swedish general election, 1991|1991 general election]], Borg became a Political Adviser at the Prime Minister's Office with responsibility for coordination of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Public Administration, the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Education and Science. From [[1993]] to [[1994]] he served as a Political Adviser to [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Carl Bildt]].

Following the defeat in the [[Swedish general election, 1994|1994 general election]], Borg worked in the private [[Bank]] sector. From [[1995]] to [[1998]] he worked at the company Transferator Alfred Berg as responsible for economic and political analysis. From 1998 to [[1999]] he was Chief Economist at ABN Amro Bank in Stockholm and from 1999 to [[2001]] he was Head of the Economic Analysis Department at [[Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken]] (SEB) in Stockholm. From 2001 to [[2002]] he served as an Adviser on monetary policy issues to the Executive Board of the [[Riksbank]] (the Swedish central bank).  He was recruited as Chief Economist of the Moderate Party in [[2003]] by [[Bo Lundgren]] and stayed in the team of the newly elected party leader [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]].  He also served as a Member of the Board of the [[Swedish Labour Market Administration]] ({{lang-sv|Arbetsmarknadsstyrelsen}}) from [[2005]] to [[2006]].

Following the victory in the [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006 general election]], Borg was appointed [[Minister for Finance (Sweden)|Minister for Finance]] in the new [[centre-right]] cabinet, led by [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]], that assumed office on [[October 6]], [[2006]]. 

Borg has been recognised as the mastermind behind the new Swedish government's economical doctrine, focusing on proactive measures against unemployment.  An incremental dismantling of the social democratic [[welfare state]], with larger self-financing of welfare systems, lower taxes and fewer benefits are seen as the way to create new motivation to work and more business opportunites and creation of jobs.  He developed these new policies in his role as chief economist in the Moderate Party.

Anders Borg is married to Susanna "Sanna" Borg ([[n<U+00E9>e]] <U+00D6>lander), with whom he has three children.  He lives with his family in [[Katrineholm]] in [[S<U+00F6>dermanland County]].

Unlike most of the Moderate Party members of the cabinet, Anders Borg is a self-described [[Feminism|feminist]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Lova|last=Olsson|title=Borg g<U+00E5>r g<U+00E4>rna mot str<U+00F6>mmen|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_14417005.asp|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|date=2007-01-14|accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref>
