'''Geoff Barnes''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[David Roper]].

Geoff was introduced as a love interest for the long running character, [[Michelle Fowler]], in 1994. He was much older than Michelle, and their age difference caused most of the major problems in their relationship. They planned to marry, but in the end Geoff realised that Michelle didn't really love him. He ended the relationship and moved to Scotland in April 1995, but returned in September as part of Michelle<U+2019>s exit storyline. His last appearance was in October 1995.

== Character creation and development ==
1994 was a "historic" year for ''EastEnders'', as in April a third weekly episode was introduced.<ref name="first10years">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-37057-2}}</ref> Due to the program<U+2019>s increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast.<ref name="first10years"/> Among them was Geoff Barnes, a middle-aged lecturer at the University Michelle attended. 

The character was introduced in May 1994 under executive and series producers [[Leonard Lewis]] and [[Barbara Emile]].<ref name="first10years"/> [[Yorkshire]] born actor, [[David Roper]], was cast in the role. Unlike the majority of the other regular characters, Geoff did not live in [[Walford]], but in [[North London]]. 

Geoff formed a friendship with Michelle while assisting her with her University work and this later developed into a romance<U+2014>a plotline that has been compared to the 1983 film ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]''.<ref name="who">{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-55178-X}}</ref> Michelle was a character who had a history of falling for older men and writer [[Colin Brake]] has commented on her relationship with Geoff in the book, ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders: The First Ten Years]]'' (published in 1994): <U+201C>For the first time since [[Den Watts|Den [Watts]]], Michelle found herself attracted to a much older man. After years of disastrous relationships with men, who can say if she has made the right choice this time?<U+201D> <ref name="first10years"/> 

Michelle<U+2019>s relationship with Geoff proved to be one of her most enduring. They remained an on-screen couple for roughly 12 months. Storylines mainly focused on the characters class and age differences. Geoff's age was 53 at the time of his introduction, several years older than Michelle's father, [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]]. Geoff deviated considerably from all of Michelle<U+2019>s former partners. He was portrayed as mature, dependable and secure. In an episode that aired in April 1995, Michelle<U+2019>s mother Pauline comments that Geoff is <U+201C>safe and secure<U+201D> and a <U+201C>steadying influence<U+201D> on Michelle.<ref>{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1995-04-20}}</ref> She adds that Michelle <U+201C>needs someone like him<U+201D> as she has had <U+201C>the most unsuitable boyfriends all her life<U+201D> and she ought to settle down. Ultimately however, these traits in Geoff were the reason for the destruction of the relationship. Michelle frequently commented that the relationship lacked <U+201C>passion<U+201D> <ref name="ep">{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders  |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1995-03-23}}</ref> and although they planned to marry, Geoff realized that Michelle did not love him and <U+201C>nobly<U+201D> finished with her.<ref name="who"/>

Geoff remained a regular character for a year, and was eventually written out in April 1995, following his split from Michelle. The character returned for brief stints in September and October 1995, to aid the departure of [[Susan Tully]], who left ''EastEnders'' after nearly eleven years playing Michelle.

== Storylines ==
Yorkshire born Geoff was Michelle Fowler's personal tutor at University. When Michelle began performing badly during her final year, Geoff helped her get back on track. They became friends, which soon developed into a romance.<ref name="first10years"/> 

Geoff was nearly 30 years older than Michelle. The age difference was initially a concern for Geoff, but Michelle was not perturbed. She continued seeing him despite objections from her father, [[Arthur Fowler|Arthur]], who grew increasingly antagonized by Geoff<U+2019>s presence. Arthur felt that his paternal role towards Michelle and her daughter [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]] was being superseded by Geoff, and he resented him because of this.<ref>{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders  |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1994-12-13}}</ref>

Geoff was divorced and had three grown children, including a daughter named Felicity. Felicity turned out to be an obnoxious snob and there was a clear class divide between her and Michelle. Felicity frequently goaded Michelle about her past and for dating a middle-aged man. There was an underlying hostility every time they met.<ref>{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders  |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1994-07-05}}</ref>

Later in the year, Geoff supported [[Pat Evans|Pat Butcher]] through a troublesome period, and subsequently became the object of her affections. Out of sympathy, Geoff took an interest in Pat's affairs, and even persuaded her to take an evening course in business studies. Pat soon began to think that Geoff was interested in her sexually, but Geoff seemed oblivious to her advances. Gossip began to spread about the nature of their relationship and at this time Geoff decided to let Pat down gently. However, he was beaten to it by Pat who sensed the on-coming rejection and announced <U+2212> to Geoff's surprise <U+2212> that they should no longer see each other socially.<ref>{{cite episode |title=EastEnders |series= EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders  |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One|BBC1]]|airdate=1994-10-13}}</ref>

In 1995, Geoff was offered a new job in Scotland. He asked Michelle to marry him, hoping that she and Vicki would join him there. Michelle was hesitant and Arthur reacted with fury <U+2212> denouncing their relationship as <U+201C>unnatural<U+201D>. However, Arthur<U+2019>s extreme opposition only encouraged Michelle to go against his wishes. Although Michelle claimed to love Geoff, she worried that their relationship lacked passion. After weeks of contemplation, she was finally persuaded to accept by her arch nemesis [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]], who goaded her about her boring life in Walford. Geoff <U+2212> who had already prepared himself for rejection <U+2212> was stunned and thrilled when she agreed to marry him.<ref name="ep"/>

In April, Geoff and Michelle travelled to Scotland to view their new home. Michelle did not seem particularly happy, which Geoff picked up on. Michelle's mother, [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]], unwittingly made the situation worse when she praised Geoff for being safe and secure, unlike Michelle's other boyfriends. He began to realize that Michelle found him dull and boring. After a bout of heavy contemplation, he told Michelle that getting married would be a mistake, because she did not love him enough. Michelle argued that affection and respect were more important than passionate love, but Geoff refused to allow her to waste her life on a loveless marriage. They parted company and Geoff remained in Scotland.<ref name="who"/>

He returned to Walford unexpectedly in September, to see if Michelle was interested in taking a job as a research assistant in America with one of his colleagues. Geoff admitted that he still loved Michelle. They spent the night together and talked about reconciling. Michelle remained unsure and told him that she needed time to think it over. She eventually opted against reconciliation with Geoff and took the job in America instead. Geoff left Walford with a broken heart in October 1995; Michelle left Walford shortly after, having fallen pregnant with Grant Mitchell<U+2019>s child.<ref name="who"/>
