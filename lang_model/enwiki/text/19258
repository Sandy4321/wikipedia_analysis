It is made by placing the uncooked filling on a flat pastry circle, and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal. The result is a raised semicircular package. The traditional '''Cornish pasty''', which has [[Protected Geographical Status|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) status in Europe, is filled with [[beef]], sliced or diced potato, [[rutabaga|swede]] (also known as a rutabaga) and onion, and is [[baking|baked]]. Today, the pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall and accounts for 6% of the Cornish food economy. Pasties with many different fillings are made; some [[retailing|shop]]s specialise in selling all sorts of pasties. 

The origins of the pasty are unclear, though there are many references to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The earliest recorded recipe is from Devon in 1510, though there is a possibility that people from Cornwall were making pasties for thousands of years prior. There is a popular belief that pasties were commonly made with a "sweet" end creating a two course meal and although these have been created by amateur cooks, there is little evidence that these were widespread. The pasty is now popular world wide, due to the [[Cornish diaspora|spread of Cornish miners]] and variations can be found in Australia, USA and Mexico.

==History==
[[File:Pasty2.jpg|thumb|An old postcard from Cornwall]]
The exact origins of the pasty are unclear, despite the modern pasty's strong association with [[Cornwall]]. It became popular in Cornwall during the 17th and 18th centuries, where miners and other workers adopted it due to its unique shape, forming a complete meal that can be carried easily and eaten without cutlery.<ref>{{cite book | title=Cornish Saints & Sinners | author=Harris, J Henry | year=2009 | publisher=Wildside Press LLC | Page=195 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZRDxG44Thg4C&pg=PA195&dq=pasty+origin&hl=en&ei=OyJuTdOyNNSwhQfV1q03&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=pasty%20origin&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2460056/The-history-of-the-Cornish-pasty.html | title=The History of the Cornish Pasty | accessdate=2 March 2011 | author=Devlin, Kate | date=25 July 2008 | publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref><ref name="grigson" />  Traditionally, [[Tin#Mining and smelting|tin miner]]s would keep their pasties hot in large ovens at the surface, each marked in pastry with the miner's name before baking. The miner could then eat the pasty holding the thick edge, which ensured that his dirty fingers (possibly including traces of [[arsenic]]) did not touch food or his mouth. Any excess pastry was left for the [[knocker (folklore)|knockers]], capricious spirits in the mines who might otherwise lead miners into danger.<ref name="Trust">{{cite book | title=Gentleman's Relish: And Other Culinary Oddities | author=National Trust | authorlink=National Trust | year=2007 | publisher=Anova Books | pages=78-9 | isbn=1905400551 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cRcQizr0uy8C&pg=PA79&dq=Cornish+Pasty+knocker&hl=en&ei=iyRuTdDSLJGwhAfzuIEx&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDYQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> There is also a traditional belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft.<ref name="hall">{{cite book | title=The Cornish Pasty | author=Hall, Stephen | year=2001 | publisher=Agre Books | location=Nettlecombe, Uk | isbn=0 9538000 4 0}}</ref>

In 2006, a researcher in Devon discovered a recipe for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of the ingredients. This replaced previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the [[Cornwall Records Office]] in [[Truro]], Cornwall.<ref name="WhoInvented"/> The dish at the time was cooked with [[venison]], in this case from the [[Mount Edgcumbe House|Mount Edgcumbe]] estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal.<ref name="Gourmet"/> Alongside the ledger which included the price of the pasty in [[Plymouth, Devon]] in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish.<ref name="bbcdebon">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cornwall/6144460.stm |title=UK &#124; England &#124; Cornwall &#124; Devon invented the Cornish pasty |publisher=BBC News |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=14 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="WhoInvented"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a2a.org.uk/search/records.asp?cat=028-1_1&cid=6-2|title=West Devon Record Office|accessdate=23 December 2005}}</ref> However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records, for example the 12th century romance, [[Erec and Enide]], written by [[Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes]], mentions pasties - eaten by characters from the area now known as Cornwall.<ref name="WhoInvented">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/who-invented-the-cornish-pasty-424094.html |title=Who invented the Cornish pasty? |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=21 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="context" /> Cornish historian, Les Merton, states that evidence could be found that the pasty was eaten in Cornwall as far back as 8,000 BC, passed down without written records.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/nov/13/britishidentity.foodanddrink | title=Devon claims 200-year lead on the Cornish pasty | accessdate=2 March 2011 | author=Taylor, Matthew | date=13 November 2006 | publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>

Other early references to pasties include a 13th century charter which was granted by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1207&ndash;1272) to the town of [[Great Yarmouth]].

===Protected status===
Following a nine year campaign, the term "Cornish pasty" was awarded [[Protected Geographical Status|Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) status by the [[European Commission]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/23/cornish-pasties-eu-cornwall | title=Putting the Cornish back into pasties | accessdate=2 March 2011 | author=Poirier, Agn<U+00E8>s | date=23 February 2011 | publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> The PGI status specifies the recipe and method by which Cornish pasties must be made, and means that only Cornish pasties prepared in Cornwall can be called a "Cornish Pasty". Pasties do not have to be baked in Cornwall &ndash; the PGI states "Assembly of the pasties in preparation for baking must take place in the designated area. The actual baking does not have to be done within the geographical area, it is possible to send the finished but unbaked and/or frozen pasties to bakers or other outlets outside the area where they can be baked in ovens for consumption."<ref>{{cite web | url= http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:190:0033:0036:EN:PDF | format= PDF | work= Official Journal of the European Union | date= 14 July 2010 | date= 11 November 2008 |title=COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 510/2006 <U+2018>CORNISH PASTY<U+2019> EC No: UK-PGI-005-0727-11.11.2008 | accessdate= 22 February 2010}}</ref> Pasties which conform to the requirements can be stamped with a new logo.<ref name="BBCPGI>{{cite news | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-12535751 | title= Cornish pasty name given European protected status | publisher= BBC News |date= 22 February 2011}}</ref> 

The application for PGI status was made by the Cornish Pasty Association, the trade organisation for pasty making in Cornwall. The Cornish Pasty Association noted that there are strong links between pasty production and local suppliers of the ingredients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornishpastyassociation.co.uk/pgi_2.html |title=The Cornish Pasty Association's application for PGI |publisher=Cornishpastyassociation.co.uk |date= |accessdate= 14 August 2009}}</ref> The decision to give the Cornish pasty a protected status was unpopular with some, especially in Devon, where one manufacturer who said that "[EU bureaucrats could] go to hell". Major UK supermarkets [[Asda]] and [[Morrisons]] both stated they would be affected by the change.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/8340861/Cornish-pasty-given-EU-protected-status.html | title=Cornish pasty given EU protected status | accessdate=2 March 2011 | author=Wallop, Harry | publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

===Popularity===
Pasties are very popular throughout the UK, with members of the Cornish Pasty Association (a group of about 50 pasty makers based in Cornwall) making about 87 million pasties each year. Sales of Cornish pasties amount to <U+00A3>60 million - about 6% of the food economy of Cornwall<ref>{{cite news|last=Savill|first=Richard|title=Cornish pasty in European battle for protected status|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2460187/Cornish-pasty-in-European-battle-for-protected-status.html|accessdate=4 March 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 July 2008}}</ref> and accounts for 13,000 jobs. Recent surveys by the South West tourism board show that one of the top three reasons people visit Cornwall is the food and that the Cornish pasty is the food most associated with Cornwall.<ref name="DEFRA"/> They are also popular in the northern United States, especially in [[Butte, Montana]] the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] and the [[Iron Range]] of north-eastern Minnesota, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.

==Recipes and ingredients==
[[File:Cornish pasty - cut.jpeg|thumb|A traditional Cornish pasty filled with steak and vegetables]]
{{cookbook|Pasties}}
The traditional recipe for a Cornish pasty, as defined by its [[Protected Geographical Status|protected status]] includes diced or minced [[beef]], [[onion]], [[potato]] and [[Rutabaga|swede]] in rough chunks along with some "light peppery" [[seasoning]].<ref name="DEFRA"/> Due to an local colloquialism, swede can be referred to and advertised as [[turnip]] whilst in a pasty, but only swede may appear in a pasty.<ref name="turnip"/> Pasty ingredients are usually seasoned with salt and pepper, depending on individual taste.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|author=Ann Pringle Harris|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/07/travel/fare-of-the-country-in-cornwall-a-meal-in-a-crust.html?scp=1&sq=annie%20pringle%20harris%20cornwall&st=cse&pagewanted=1/|title=Fare of the Country; In Cornwall, a Meal in a Crust|work=New York Times|date=7 February 1988|accessdate=15 March 2005}}</ref> The type of pastry used is not defined, as long as it is golden in colour

===Variations===
Although the official pasty has a specific ingredients list, old Cornish cookery books show that pasties were generally made from whatever food was available.<ref name=Gourmet>{{cite book|last=Trewin|first=Carol|title=Gourmet Cornwall|year=2005|publisher=Alison Hodge Publishers|isbn=0906720397|pages=125-129|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=swU53UBC1LEC&pg=PA127&dq=pasty&hl=en&ei=fcNwTaCkGZKHhQe-icVG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pasty&f=false|coauthors=Woolfitt, Adam}}</ref> Indeed, the earliest recorded pasty recipes include venison - not beef.<ref name="WhoInvented"/> In modern usage, "pasty" has become a generic name for the shape and can contain a variety of fillings, including [[stilton cheese|stilton]], vegetarian and even [[chicken tikka]].<ref name="Gourmet" /> [[Pork]] and [[apple]] pasties are readily available in shops throughout Cornwall, with the ingredients including an apple flavoured sauce, mixed together throughout the pasty, as well as sweet pasties with ingredients such as apple and fig or chocolate and banana, which are common in some areas of Cornwall.<ref name="grigson">Grigson, Jane (1993) ''English Food''. Penguin Books, p. 226</ref>

A part-savoury, part-sweet pasty (similar to the [[Bedfordshire clanger]]) was eaten by miners in the 19th Century, in the Copper mines on [[Parys Mountain]], [[Anglesey]]. The technician who did the research and discovered the recipe claimed that the recipe was probably taken to Anglesey by Cornish miners travelling to the area looking for work.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_west/4841110.stm |title=UK &#124; Wales &#124; North West Wales &#124; Sweet-savoury pastie back on menu |publisher=BBC News |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> No two-course pasties are commercially produced in Cornwall today,<ref name="merrick">{{cite book|title=The Pasty Book|first=Hettie|last= Merrick|publisher=Tor Mark Press [place=Penryn|date= 1995]}}</ref> but are usually the product of amateur cooks.<ref name="nyt" /> Whilst that there is a popular belief that two-course pasties were produced, a Cornish Historian, Les Merton, has stated that this does not appear to have ever been a common practice.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who, What, Why: What exactly is a Cornish pasty?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12550221|accessdate=11 March 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=23 February 2011}}</ref>

===Shape===
Although the guidelines for a Cornish pasty state that it must be a "D" shape, with crimping along one side,  crimping is contested even in Cornwall itself, with some advocating a side crimp while others maintain that a top crimp is more authentic.<ref name="merrick">{{cite book|title=The Pasty Book|first=Hettie|last= Merrick|publisher=Tor Mark Press|place=Penryn|=1995}}</ref><ref name="grigson" /> It has been said that the difference between Devon pasties and Cornish pasties is that the Devon pasty has a crimped crust running along the top of the pasty and is oval in shape, whereas the Cornish pasty is semicircular with a thicker crust running along the curved edge of the pasty.<ref name="nyt" />

Migrating Cornish miners,  (colloquially [[Cornish diaspora|Cousin Jacks]] in the US) helped to spread pasties into the rest of the world during the 19th century. As tin mining in Cornwall began to fail, miners brought their expertise and traditions to new mining regions around the world. As a result, pasties can be found in many regions, including:

* Many parts of Australia, including [[Yorke Peninsula]], the site of an annual pasty festival since 1973, which claims to be the world's largest. A clarification of the Protected Geographical Status ruling has confirmed that pasties made in Australia are still allowed to be called "Cornish Pasties".<ref>{{cite news|last=Pearlman|first=Jonathan|title=Australian Cornish pasty region concerned about protected ruling|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/8361654/Australian-Cornish-pasty-region-concerned-about-protected-ruling.html|accessdate=11 March 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=4 March 2011}}</ref> 

* The [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. In some of these areas, pasties are a significant tourist attraction, including an annual [[Pasty Fest]] in [[Calumet, Michigan]] in early July. Pasties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have a particularly unusual history, as a small influx of [[Finnish people|Finnish]] immigrants followed the Cornish miners in 1864. These Finns (and many other ethnic groups) adopted the pasty for use in the [[Copper Country]] copper mines. About 30 years later, a much larger flood of Finnish immigrants found their countrymen baking pasties. The pasty has become strongly associated with Finnish culture in this area, and in the culturally similar [[Iron Range]] in northern Minnesota.<ref name="american">{{cite book|last=Shortridge|first=Barbara|title=The taste of American place|year=1998|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0847685071|pages=21 - 36|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DsDW7DHknCQC&dq=American+Pasty&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref>

* [[Mineral Point, Wisconsin]] was the site of the first mineral rush in the USA during the 1830s.  After lead was discovered in Mineral Point many of the early miners migrated to this south-western Wisconsin area from Cornwall.  Those Cornish miners brought their skills working in the deep underground tin mines of Cornwall.  They also brought their recipe and appetite for the pasty.<ref>Mineral Point Chamber of Commerce: A Brief History of Mineral Point, http://www.mineralpoint.com/history/index.html, accessed January 31, 2011</ref>

* The Mexican state of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]], and the twin silver mining cities of [[Pachuca]] and Real del Monte ([[Mineral del Monte]]), have notable Cornish influences from the Cornish miners who settled there with pasties being considered typical local cuisine. In Mexican Spanish, they are referred to as ''[[paste (food)|pastes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pastes ''(Spanish)''|publisher=Turismo del Gobierno del Estado de Hidalgo |url=http://turismo.hidalgo.gob.mx/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=147|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070611213431/http://turismo.hidalgo.gob.mx/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=147|archivedate=2007-08-18|accessdate=3 May 2008}}</ref>

Pasties have been mentioned multiple literary works since the 12th century [[Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes]], from the [[Robin Hood]] tales in the 14th century to [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.<ref name="context" /> The dish was even mentioned in three plays by [[William Shakespeare]]. <ref>In ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' Act 1 Scene 1, Page says ''Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner: come gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness''.</ref><ref>In ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', Act IV Scene III, Parrolles states: ''I will confess to what I know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more''.</ref><ref>In ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', Titus bakes Chiron and Demetrius's bodies into a pasty, and forces their mother to eat them.</ref> A [[West Country]] schoolboy [[playground]]-[[rhyme]] current in the 1940s concerning the pasty went:''''[[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], ate a pasty five [[foot (length)|feet]] long, Ate it once, ate it twice, Oh my Lord, it's full of [[mice]]''.<ref name="hall" />
 
Pasties appear in many novels, used to draw parallels or represent Cornwall. In ''[[American Gods]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]], main character Shadow discovers pasties at Mabel's restaurant in the fictional town of Lakeside. The food is mentioned as being popularized in America by Cornishmen, as a parallel to how gods are "brought over" to America in the rest of the story. Another literature reference takes place in ''[[The Cat Who]]''... series by [[Lilian Jackson Braun]]. Pasties are referred to as a cultural part of the north country, and Jim Qwilleran often eats at The Nasty Pasty, a popular restaurant in fictional Moose County, famous for its tradition of being a mining settlement. Reference to pasties is made in [[Brian Jacques]]' popular ''[[Redwall]]'' series of novels, where it is a staple favourite on the menu to the mice and hares of Redwall Abbey. Pasties also appear in the ''[[The Poldark Novels|Poldark]]'' series of [[historical novel]]s of Cornwall, by [[Winston Graham]], as well as the [[BBC]] television series adapted from these works. 

===Oggy oggy oggy===
{{main|Oggy oggy oggy}}
The word "oggy" in the internationally popular rhyme "[[Oggy Oggy Oggy|Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi]]" is thought to stem from Cornish dialect "''hoggan''", deriving from "hogen" the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] word for pasty. When the pasties were ready for eating, the [[bal maiden]]s at the mines would shout down the shaft "Oggy Oggy Oggy" and the miners would reply "Oi Oi Oi".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gibson|first=Rory|title=Time for Aussies to lose 'bogan' chant?|url=http://www.news.com.au/travel/news/time-for-aussies-to-throw-bogan-chant-out/story-e6frfq80-1225943556735|accessdate=11 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Courier-Mail]]|date=26 October 2010}}</ref>

===Pasty superstitions===
Cornish pasties in tin mines around Cornwall are associated with "[[knocker (folklore)|Knocker]]s", spirits which create a sounds similar to a knock to indicate the location of the veins of ore. Although they were supposedly helpful to the miners, they would also be mischievous when a miner was caught whistling or swearing. To appease the Knockers, and encourage their good will, Cornish miners would discard the crimp of the pasty within the mine, for the Knockers to eat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Froud|first=Brian|title=Faeries|year=2002|publisher=Pavilion|isbn=1862055580|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9MgsqlMARBAC&dq=pasty+knockers&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref><ref name="Trust" /> Sailors and fisherman would likewise discard a crust to appease the spirits of dead mariners. These crusts were usually snapped up by seagulls, popularly held in [[West Country]] superstition to be the souls of dead mariners.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.it/books?id=Ht_02x-2JksC&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=seaguls+dead+sailors+superstition&source=bl&ots=gzG89hQK4z&sig=9Ttx7HOyICeqipHXN9ROP6UTv60&hl=it&ei=DjBGSq7pL86QsAaD7vgi&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1 |title=Encyclopedia of Superstitions 1949 - Google Libri |publisher=Books.google.it |date= |accessdate=14 August 2009 | first1=Edwin | last1=Radford | isbn=9781417976553}}</ref>

==Giant pasties==
As the national dish of Cornwall, the pasty has been subject to several oversized versions.
