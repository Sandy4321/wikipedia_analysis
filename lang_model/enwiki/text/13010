"'''Helter Shelter'''" is the fifth episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|fourteenth season]] of the American [[Animated cartoon|animated]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox network|Fox]] network in the United States on December 1, 2002. In the episode, the [[Simpson family]] has to find temporary residence while their house is fumigated for [[termite]]s. When they run out of options, they decide to become contestants on a reality show where families live in the manner that people did in 1895. The family is initially miserable, but slowly adapt to their new life, which causes the show to lose ratings. The producers decide to try to boost viewers by dumping the house in a river and forcing the family to survive in the wilderness. However, the Simpsons find a bunch of rejects from other reality shows and they attack the producers.

==Plot==
After [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is hit by a falling metal beam at work and suffers a serious head injury, [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]]  buys him off with tickets at a luxury [[Luxury box|sky box]] at a hockey game as compensation. Bart, Marge and Homer enjoy the sushi, caricature artist, and appearance by [[Larry Holmes]], while Lisa leaves in disgust so she can watch the game with real fans in real surroundings. When she gives a Russian player advice which leads to him scoring a goal, she receives his hockey stick as a gift. However, [[termites]] which were living in the stick end up eating away at the entire Simpson house. An exterminator says their house should be tented and fumigated, and they cannot return for six months. However, the family has no place to go as the only hotel they can afford is booked for months. At [[Moe's Tavern]], [[Barney Gumble|Barney]] and [[Lenny and Carl#Carl Carlson|Carl]] inform the Simpsons about a [[reality show]], where a family is put in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] house in which they must live as if it was the year 1895. Homer is reluctant at first, but the family decides to apply for the reality show.

At the studio, the executives screen many families and finally they settle on the Simpsons, after viewing Homer's overreactions over nothing. They are taken to the Victorian house and shown around by the network executive, who says that they will be filmed at all times. The only thing of the 20th century there is a "Confessional Room", which is a small room with a video camera where they say what they feel about the lifestyle. The family struggles with all of the drastic changes in their daily life and are pretty miserable, much to the delight of the show's audience, who cannot wait to see which of them dies first. Homer tries to lighten up the family, saying they should be glad on television, and they begin to conform to their new lives cheerily. This is not deemed as entertaining, however, and viewership begins to drop. In attempts to save the show, the executives decide to introduce Squiggy from ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' into the household, since he is the biggest 1970s television star whose phone has not been disconnected. But even his presence does not boost the ratings. Finally, one of the executives comes up with an idea; the house is airlifted at night and put into a river.

The Simpsons are shocked to find what had happened the next morning, and the house finally washes up on shore and falls apart, with Squiggy in it. The network crew is filming it and loving the drama that unfolds. They then break for lunch, but deny the Simpsons any of it so they go to eat some bugs. Later on, the family is confronted by a bunch of savage-looking people, who turn out to be contestants who lost a final challenge on a ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''-type show and were abandoned in the jungle. They decide to overpower the crew and return to civilization. Together with the Simpsons, they attack the crew, overpowering them. Finally at home, Homer decides to watch scripted television shows, as he has had it with reality shows.

Since airing, "Helter Shelter" has received generally negative reviews from critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that the story of the episode is "not a terrible idea for an episode, but it<U+2019>s not a particularly exciting one, either. The show plods through its scenario without much life, mostly because parodies of reality TV just aren<U+2019>t very interesting; the programs they mock are already so absurd that there<U+2019>s not much room for satire."<ref name=Jacobson/> Ryan Keefer of [[DVD Talk]] wrote that the episode is "a prime example of [the show's writers] trying to do something funny and falling flat."<ref name=Keefer>{{cite web|last=Keefer|first=Ryan|title=The Simpsons: The Fourteenth Season (Blu-ray)|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/52622/simpsons-the-complete-fourteenth-season-the/|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=2012-08-22|date=2011-12-15}}</ref>
