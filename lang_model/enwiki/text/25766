It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the [[United States]] on April 25, 1999. In the episode, after offending the Olympic committee during their visit to Springfield Elementary, the school's students are committed to 20 hours of [[community service]]. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], along with his sister [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], are put in charge of Springfield's old folks home, where Bart notices the doldrums that the old people go through every day. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa's father [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] tries to sell springs.

"The Old Man and the 'C' Student" was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]] and was the first episode [[Julie Thacker]] wrote for ''The Simpsons''. While Bart's storyline was pitched by Thacker, the B-story, involving Homer, was conceived by Thacker's husband [[Mike Scully]], who also was an executive producer and the [[showrunner]] for the episode. [[Jack Lalanne]] guest-starred as himself in the episode. On its original broadcast, the episode received a 6.9 Nielsen rating, and following the release of ''The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season'', the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
When [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] writes a letter to the [[International Olympic Committee]], they decide that [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] will be home to the next [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. To honor the Olympics, there is a contest for the games' mascot. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] creates a mascot for the Olympic Games named Springy, the Springfield Spring, which becomes the mascot (much to Patty and Selma's dismay, who created a mascot named Ciggy the Cigarette) and everyone in Springfield prepares for the games. When the IOC inspects the town, things go well until [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] does a comedy routine that insults foreign nations. Only [[Principal Skinner]], Homer, and the children laugh at Bart's jokes. In response, the IOC decides not to let Springfield have the Olympics anymore (they award it to [[Shelbyville (The Simpsons)|Shelbyville]], who presumably and chronologically lost it to [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]]), and Superintendent Chalmers blames Skinner for putting Bart on stage with his racy jokes. Skinner initially keeps his case strong by telling Chalmers that the comedy worked well during rehearsal, but to prevent losing his job, he makes every one of the school's students do 20 hours of [[community service]]. After sending Milhouse to [[Waste collection|collect medical waste]] on the beach and leaving Martin to start a basketball program between inter-city gangs, Skinner has Bart assigned to work at the Springfield Retirement Castle, where Lisa also works voluntarily. Bart is dismayed at how little the seniors are allowed to do.

Meanwhile, Homer gets 1,000 springs he intended to sell as Olympic mascots. He uses various [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s to sell off the mascots, but fails miserably due to hatred toward Bart for costing the town the Olympics: ultimately, he is forced to flush them down the toilet. At the time Lisa leads the seniors in "imagination time", but when she departs, Bart makes the seniors escape to get a taste of freedom. Bart takes the seniors on a trip on the town and on a boat ride, and Lisa is initially shocked to see these things happen, but nevertheless, she is quite impressed by what Bart does for the seniors. The seniors have fun until their boat crashes into [[Mr. Burns]]'s [[schooner]]. The boat begins to sink and the seniors turn on Bart, but [[Grampa Simpson|Abe]] defends him, saying Bart gave them the best fun they have had in years. However, the springs that Homer flushed down the toilet save them, causing the boat to bob up at the surface long enough for the [[Coast Guard]] to rescue everyone. Bart finishes his community service time, but decides to help the seniors still enjoy themselves.

"The Old Man and the 'C' Student" was directed by [[Mark Kirkland]] and was the first episode [[Julie Thacker]] wrote for ''The Simpsons''. It was first broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in  the [[United States]] on April 25, 1999. The episode's plot was based on a "disastrous" school program, in which students had to participate in community service in order to be allowed to advance to the next grade. Thacker, whose oldest daughter was a student at the school, was signed up to do community service at an old folks home in the town they lived in. It became the inspiration for the episode's A-story, while the B-story, which involved Homer selling springs, was conceived by Thacker's husband [[Mike Scully]], an executive producer and the [[showrunner]] for the episode.<ref name="Thacker">Thacker, Julie.

In a scene in the episode, Lenny gets one of Homer's springs stuck in his eye. Lenny's eye injuries have since become a running gag, and "The Old Man and the 'C' Student" "started the trend," according to Thacker.<ref name="Thacker" /> The "clunky, Up With People-type" dance that the student's perform for the Olympic jury was partly demonstrated during the animatic by ''Simpsons'' writer [[George Meyer]]. When Meyer later watched the episode, he found out, to his "horror," that he had been given a choreographer credit at the end of the episode.<ref name="Meyer">Meyer, George. (2007). Commentary for "The Old Man and the 'C' Student", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The episode features American fitness expert [[Jack Lalanne]] as himself. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that Lalanne was "very funny" and that he "gave a great performance."<ref name="Scully" /> Lalanne's lines were recorded separately from the series main cast members.<ref name="Cartwright">Cartwright, Nancy. (2007). Commentary for "The Old Man and the 'C' Student", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The song that plays when Bart sets the old people free is "[[Can't Buy Me Love]]", which is also played during the episode's end credits. Although the original version is performed by The Beatles, the version heard in the episode is a cover performed by [[NRBQ]].<ref name="Scully" />

==Cultural references==
In the beginning of the episode, a sign reading "[[International Olympic Committee]]" can be seen. The logo below the text parodies the logo of the real International Olympic Committee. Because they did not want to "upset" the committee, the ''Simpsons'' staff slightly altered the logo by changing the colors and not making the rings interlock.<ref name="Scully">Scully, Mike. (2007). Commentary for "The Old Man and the 'C' Student", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In a scene in the episode, the old people can be seen watching the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''. The nurse that works in the old folks home is based on Nurse Ratched from the American drama film ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]''.<ref name="Kirkland">Kirkland, Mark. (2007). Commentary for "The Old Man and the 'C' Student", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The film is referenced again in a scene in which a character in the old folk's home throws a dishwasher through a window, and jumps out, mirroring the last scene in the film.<ref name="Scully" /> The character then returns, and hands Lisa a pamphlet that reads "Prop 217". The pamphlet is a reference to Proposition 217, a proposition that allowed [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s to operate casinos in certain states. It is also a reference to the day Scully and Thacker met, which was on February 17.<ref name="Scully" /> The scene in which Smithers is drawing a portrait of Mr Burns is a reference to the 1997 drama film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref name="Kirkland" /> The sinking of the ship is also a reference to the film. During the end credits, an album cover reading "A Bart Day's Night", a reference to The Beatles' album "[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]", is shown. The song "Can't Buy Me Love", which plays at the same time, originated from "A Hard Day's Night".
