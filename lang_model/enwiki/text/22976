__NOTOC__  
'''Freiston''' is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in [[Lincolnshire]], England, about {{convert|4|mi|km|1}}  east of [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]].

It is one of 18 civil parishes which, together with Boston, form the [[Boston (borough)|Borough of Boston]] local government arrangement, in place since a reorganisation of 1&nbsp;April&nbsp;1974 which resulted from the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. The parish forms part of the Coastal electoral ward. Freiston is also the location of [[North Sea Camp (HM Prison)|HMP North Sea Camp]], a men's [[British prison security categories|open prison]].

Freiston [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I]] listed [[Anglican]] parish church is dedicated to [[James, son of Zebedee|St James]].<ref name=NHLE>[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1308415 "Church of St James"], ''National Heritage List for England'', English Heritage. Retrieved 1 August 2011</ref> The church was originally [[cruciform]] with a central tower. The existing tower is of [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] style, and the parts of the [[nave]] are [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English]]. The roof and [[chancel]] were restored in 1763, and the whole building in 1871.<ref name=Kellys>''Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull'' 1885, pp. 397, 398</ref> An earlier [[rood screen]] was sold to the church at [[Fishtoft]].<ref name=Cox>Cox, J. Charles (1916) ''Lincolnshire'' p. 129; Methuen & Co. Ltd</ref>

In 1114  [[Freiston Priory]] (St James) was founded by Alan de Creon for [[Benedictine]] monks, which became a monastic [[Monk|cell]] of [[Crowland Abbey]] in 1130. Nothing remains of the priory buildings that stood on the south side of the present church, except for a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] doorway in the south [[Aisle#Architecture|aisle]] that opened into the cloisters.<ref name=Cox/>

The settlements of '''Haltoft End''', {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} north-north-west, and '''Scrane End''' (or Crane End), {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} south from Freiston, lie within the parish<ref name=Kellys/>

==History==
Until 1914, the parish formed part of Boston [[Rural District]], in the [[Parts of Holland]]. Holland was one of the three divisions (formally known as ''parts'') of the traditional county of Lincolnshire. Since the [[Act of Parliament|Local Government Act]] of 1888, Holland had been in most respects, a county in itself.

Before this, Freiston had been in [[Skirbeck (wapentake)|Skirbeck]] [[Wapentake]],<ref>White's Directory of 1882 gives the wapentake as Loveden but this is to confuse Freiston with [[Frieston]] in [[Kesteven]].</ref> Parts of Holland.

==Freiston Shore==
On its eastern side, Freiston parish adjoins [[The Wash]].
