'''''Batman Forever''''' is a 1995 [[superhero film]]. It is the third of the ''[[Batman film series]]'' which began with [[Tim Burton|Tim Burton's]] [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 version of the character]], although it is a major departure from its predecessor ''[[Batman Returns]]''. With dramatic changes to characteristics as the cast, design, and [[Danny Elfman|Danny Elfman's]] theme, which was scrapped completely. 

The film starred [[Val Kilmer]] replacing [[Michael Keaton]] as [[Batman]], in his first and only appearance as the Dark Knight, and marked the series debut of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (played by [[Chris O'Donnell]]). [[Tommy Lee Jones]] played [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent / Two-Face]] (previously portrayed by [[Billy Dee Williams]] in ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'') while [[Jim Carrey]] played [[The Riddler]] with [[Nicole Kidman]] as [[Dr. Chase Meridian]]. The film was a financial success and garnered the sequel [[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]], which would ultimately stop further film installments being produced until ''[[Batman Begins]]''.

==Plot==
The movie opens as [[Two-Face]], the [[alter ego]] of former [[District Attorney]] Harvey Dent ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), is holding hostages in a bank vault. Batman ([[Val Kilmer]]) arrives at the scene and consults with clinical [[psychiatrist]] Dr. Chase Meridian ([[Nicole Kidman]]). Batman then rescues the hostages and foils the robbery but is unable to apprehend Two-Face. Edward Nygma ([[Jim Carrey]]), a lowly worker at [[Wayne Enterprises]] has been doing unauthorized research at work into a brain-manipulating device, ostensibly as an entertainment medium, following his perceived rejection as a business partner by [[Bruce Wayne]], whom he idolizes to the point of obsession. He is discovered at work late by a senior worker, Fred Stickley, who finds himself tested on the project and at Nygma's mercy. The device seems to affect Nygma's brain as an unexpected side effect. Stickley promptly tries to fire him, but Nygma murders him, doctors security tapes to make it look as if the man committed suicide and resigns from Wayne Enterprises.

A while later, Bruce Wayne invites Chase Meridian to accompany him to a Charity Circus, though ironically she is attracted to Batman rather than him. Two-Face and his thugs arrive at the event, firing guns and terrorizing the audience. They also bring a bomb that Two-Face will detonate if Batman does not appear. (Two-Face blames Batman for failing to thwart the [[Sal Maroni|criminal]] who threw acid into his face, disfiguring him and causing "left-brain damage" <U+2013> an event re-shown in a TV program Wayne has been watching.) The Flying Graysons, the circus acrobats, work to remove the bomb through an opening in the top of the big top. The youngest member, Dick ([[Chris O'Donnell]]), manages to push [[Two-Face|Two-Face's]] bomb out of the circus and into the water surrounding it by going ahead of his family. When he returns, he finds that Two-Face has killed the other Graysons by shooting out the wires that they were climbing on, sending them plunging to their deaths. Feeling sorry for Dick's loss and responsible for Batman's failure to show at the circus (though he had tried to make himself heard above the panic), Bruce takes a reluctant Dick in as a foster son. Dick wants to kill Two-Face for murdering his parents. Later on, Dick discovers the Batcave and so knows that Bruce is Batman. Dick asks to become his partner so that he can play a part in killing Two-face. Bruce at first resists, insisting that such a quest for revenge goes on forever, as he knows only too well. Dick will not give in, however, naming himself '[[Robin]]' partly at Alfred's suggestion (it was Dick's mother's nickname for him).

[[Image:Valandrobin.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Val Kilmer and Chris O'Donnell as Batman and Robin]]

Meanwhile, Edward Nygma, who has been stalking Bruce Wayne and leaving riddles for him, is inspired and delighted by watching Two-Face's raid at the circus on live TV <U+2013> and decides to become his partner in the form of the flamboyant and devious [[Riddler]], master of puzzles and quizzes (he has been unhinged at Wayne's insistence that his research "raises too many questions".) He proceeds to show Two-Face his perfected device, which hypnotizes TV viewers and beams signals directly into/out of the human brain, allowing people to feel as though they are 'inside' TV shows <U+2013> but as a side effect, allows Nygma to read their minds and, he claims, augment his own intelligence. The two villains make a deal: if Two-Face helps him steal enough priceless goods and money to fund his project into mass production, the Riddler will use his 'Box' device to learn Batman's true identity. Their deal sealed with a flip of the formers decision-making coin, Two-Face and the Riddler start their rampage.

After a launch event for the Box, where Nygma readopts his regular identity <U+2013> albeit more based on his idol, Wayne, than ever (complete with a fake facial mole) <U+2013> Batman's identity is indeed deduced. Two-Face unsuccessfully attempts to kill his enemy yet again, Robin aiding in foiling this. But, armed with the revelation about Batman, the villains attack Wayne Manor and the Riddler <U+2013> at pains to prevent his partner in crime from killing his idol <U+2013> blows up the [[Batcave]] and leaves a fourth and final riddle, while Two-Face kidnaps Robin and Chase. Soon, having solved the linking riddle and so located the Riddler's lair at NygmaTech's plant (on Claw Island), Batman is forced by the Riddler to make a choice between Robin and Chase, but ends up successfully saving both and destroying Riddler's central Box device. The Riddler and Two-Face are defeated: the former is overwhelmed by the exploding Box's brainwave overload; the latter falls to his death when Batman thwarts his final attempt to kill him, Robin and Chase, by launching a handful of coins when Two-Face makes one last flip. The brain-damaged Riddler is committed to Arkham Asylum, where (in his delusional state of mind) he proclaims ''himself'' rather than Bruce Wayne as Batman to a visiting Chase in the epilogue. The movie ends with Batman and Robin as a crime-fighting partnership, 'forever'.

In July 1994, [[Michael Keaton]] decided not to return for a sequel after ''[[Batman Returns]]''. Speculations arose to Keaton wanting a higher salary, while his publicist stated it was due to screen time and the new direction [[Joel Schumacher]] and [[Warner Brothers]] was aiming for. Schumacher supported Keaton's reason, saying "some people don't want to play superheroes the rest of their life. Even [[Sean Connery]] left [[James Bond]]." [[William Baldwin]] was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, [[Val Kilmer]] was cast.<ref name=next>{{cite news| author = Jeff Gordinier| title = Next At Batman | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = [[1994-07-15]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302969,00.html | accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref>

It was in December 1993 when [[Robin Williams]] stated he was in talks for the role of [[the Riddler]], and commented on his enthusiasm.<ref>{{cite news| title = Flashes: No Joker | publisher = ''Entertainment Weekly'' | date = [[1993-12-17]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308987,00.html | accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> Williams had previously expressed interest for the role of [[Joker (comics)|the Joker]] in ''Batman'', though lost out to [[Jack Nicholson]].<ref>{{cite video | title = Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight| format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2005}}</ref> Ultimately in June 1994, [[Jim Carrey]] was cast after Williams had turned down the role.<ref name=brennan/> Schumacher had known Carrey since the mid 1980s, roughly ten years before he became commercially famous. After his role in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', the studio then brought up the idea to cast Jim Carrey.<ref name=shadowbat/> [[Michael Jackson]] had previously opted hard to land the role but was ignored.<ref>{{cite news| author = Billy "Jett" Ramey| title = Joel Schumacher talks BATMAN!  | publisher = ''Batman-on-Film'' | date = [[2003-03-31]] | url = http://batman-on-film.com/b5newsarchives20.html | accessdate = 2007-11-08}}</ref>

[[Rene Russo]] was originally cast in the role of [[Dr. Chase Meridian]] when Michael Keaton was still set to play Batman, though was let go after the filmmakers thought of her to be "too old" for Kilmer.<ref name=next/> [[Robin Wright]] turned down the role while [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]] and [[Linda Hamilton]] were both considered.<ref name=brennan>{{cite news| author = Judy Brennan | title = Batman Battles New Bat Villains | publisher = ''Entertainment Weekly'' | date = [[1994-06-03]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302503,00.html | accessdate=2007-10-14}}</ref> Schumacher had wanted to work with [[Nicole Kidman]] since viewing her performance in ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'', and felt her to be perfect for the role of Dr. Chase Meridian.<ref name=shadowbat/>

[[Daniel Waters (writer)|Daniel Waters]] and [[Tim Burton]] convinced [[Warner Brothers]] to keep [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] out of ''[[Batman Returns]]'' and save him for the third installment.<ref name=burton/> [[Marlon Wayans]] was originally cast in the role before being dropped out, though was indeed signed and paid for the sequel.

Schumacher claims he met with actors [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Jude Law]], [[Alan Cumming]], and [[Toby Stevens]]. [[Chris O'Donnell]], a fan of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series as a child was cast.<ref name=shadowbat/>

[[Warner Brothers]] always felt for the third installment of the [[Batman film series]] to have a completely new look than ''[[Batman Returns]]''. Even though ''Batman Returns'' was a box office success, the studio felt it didn't make enough money as they thought it would. As such, due to complaints on how the film was "too dark," the studio decided to center the third installment towards kids. [[Batman]] co-creator [[Bob Kane]] even supported the decision. Producer Peter MacGregor-Scott cited the film as "''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' on [[acid (drug)|acid]]".<ref name=shadowbat>{{cite video | title = Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight-Reinventing a Hero| format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2005}}</ref>

[[Tim Burton]] claimed he had one meeting that lasted for half an hour with Warner Brothers regarding a sequel. He told them basic ideas he had in mind, though they both peacefully agreed for Burton to serve as producer, as Burton himself felt he had enough with two films.<ref name=burton>{{cite video | title = Shadows Of The Bat: The Cinematic Saga Of The Dark Knight-The Dark Side Of The Night| format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2005}}</ref> The studio sought after [[Joel Schumacher]] as their first choice to be Burton's replacement as director. Schumacher took the role after he felt he needed approval from Burton, a fellow friend of his.<ref name=hold>{{cite news| title = Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kilmer | publisher = ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' | date = [[1995-08-01]] | url = http://batmanmovieonline.com/behindthescenes/articles/empire1995spec.htm | accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> 

Schumacher originally had in mind to do an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. The studio rejected the idea as they wanted a sequel, not a prequel, though Schumacher was able to include very brief events in Batman's past. Lee and Janet Scott-Batchler were hired to write the script which introduced a psychotic [[Riddler]] as the only villain, with a pet rat accompanying him. Schumacher still liked the script, though felt it could be "lighted down." He hired [[Akiva Goldsman]], whom he previously had worked for on ''[[The Client (film)|The Client]]'' to write the second draft.<ref name=shadowbat/>

[[Image:Batfor.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Teaser poster for the film]]

When it came to the production design, Schumacher hired Barbara Ling, claiming that the film needed a "force" and felt Ling could "advance on it." Schumacher wanted a design that was not to be any way connected to ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Batman Returns]]'', and instead was  to be inspired by the images from the Batman comic books seen in the 1940s/early 1950s and taken from that of [[New York City]] architecture in the 1930s, with a combination of modern [[Tokyo]].<ref name=design>{{cite video | title = Out of the Shadows: The Production Design of Batman Forever| format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2005}}</ref>

Schumacher told Ling he literally wanted a "city with personality," with more statues, as well as various amounts of [[neon]]. The [[Batmobile]] was also given a makeover in comparison to that seen in ''Batman'' and ''Batman Returns''. The design team spent six weeks on five different concepts before coming up with Schumacher's choice. Two cars were constructed, one for stunt purposes and one for close ups with both showcasing a [[V8 engine]]. The [[Batcave]] introduced new technology seen in the previous two films that included what Schumacher calls, "a more suitable atmosphere." This included a turntable for the Batmobile and a moat surrounding the cave.<ref name=design/>

For the costume design, producer Peter MacGregor-Scott claimed that 146 workers were at one point working together. Batman's costume received a new design as well. The filmmakers claimed that Schumacher wanted to bring somewhere along the lines of a more "[[MTV]] organic, and edgier feel" to the film. Various suits were designed for specific purposes, such as one where as [[Val Kilmer]] sits in the Batmobile and various others for stunts and close ups. Ventilation was placed in the suit and according to the costume design team, Kilmer had "a more stature feel than [[Michael Keaton]]" which served as a minor problem.<ref name=kilmer>{{cite video | title = The Many Faces of Gotham City | format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2005}}</ref>

According to Ve Neill, Schumacher wanted [[Chris O'Donnell]] to be a heartthrob to teenage girls, thus the reason why his ears were pierced. [[Jim Carrey]] went through over 50 different [[spandex]] outfits and over 100 different props for his cane. He stated while practicing, he would continuously damage walls, ceilings, and cabinets.<ref name=kilmer/> [[Elliot Goldenthal]] was hired to compose the film score even before the first draft of the script was written. He stated he was told by Schumacher as not to listen to [[Danny Elfman]]'s previous score, and instead compose a different orchestral piece.<ref>{{cite video | title = Scoring Forever: The Music of Batman Forever | format = DVD | publisher = [[Warner Brothers]] | year = 2005}}</ref>

==Release==
===Box office performance===
''Batman Forever'' opened on [[June 16]], [[1995 in film|1995]] in the [[United States]] in 2,893 theaters, accumulating $52,784,433 over its opening weekend. The film went on to gross $336,531,112 worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=batmanforever.htm|title=Batman Forever (1995)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref> It is the third highest grossing Batman film to date, behind [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman Begins]]'', though it did have a higher opening weekend than ''Batman Begins''. The film was a box office success and naturally beat out it's $100 million budget. The opening weekend gross was a record at the time and the studio beat their goal of making more money than ''[[Batman Returns]]''. ''Batman Forever'' was the second highest grossing film of 1995, only losing to ''[[Toy Story]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1995&p=.htm| title=The 50 Top Grossing Films of 1995|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=2007-11-05}}</ref>
