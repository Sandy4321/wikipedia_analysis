'''Scouting''', also known as the '''Scout Movement''', is a worldwide [[organization|youth movement]] aiming to develop young people physically, mentally and spiritually, so that they may play constructive roles in society. 

Scouting began in 1907 when [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|R.S.S. Baden-Powell]], [[Lieutenant General]] in the [[British Army]], held the first Scouting encampment at [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|Brownsea Island]], [[England]]. Baden-Powell wrote the principles of Scouting in ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' (London, 1908), based on his earlier military books, with influence and support of [[Ernest Thompson Seton|Seton]] of the Woodcraft Indians, [[William Alexander Smith (Boys' Brigade)|Smith]] of the [[Boys' Brigade]], and his publisher [[Cyril Arthur Pearson|Pearson]]. During the first half of the [[20th century]], the movement grew to encompass three major age groups for boys ([[Cub Scout]], [[Boy Scout]], [[Rover Scout]]) and for girls ([[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownie Guide]], [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Girl Guide and Girl Scout]], [[Ranger (Girl Guide)|Ranger Guide]]). 

The movement employs the [[Scout method]], a program of non-formal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities, including [[camping]], [[woodcraft]], [[aquatics]], [[hiking]], [[backpacking]], and [[sports]]. Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout [[uniform]], by intent hiding all differences of social standing in a country and making for equality, with [[neckerchief]] and [[campaign hat]] or comparable head wear. Distinctive uniform insignia include the [[fleur-de-lis]] and the [[trefoil]], as well as [[merit badges]] and other patches. 

In 2006, Scouting and [[Girl Guides|Guiding]] together have over 38 million members in 216 countries. The two largest umbrella organizations are the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM), for boys-only and co-educational organizations, and the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS), primarily for girls-only organizations but also accepting co-educational organizations. 

==History==
===Origins===
[[Image:Scout stone Brownsea.jpg|thumb|200px|This stone on [[Brownsea Island]] commemorates the [[Brownsea Island Scout Camp|first scout camp]].]]

[[Robert Baden-Powell]] laid the foundation for modern-day Scouting during a battle of the [[Second Boer War]] (the [[Siege of Mafeking]]) in [[South Africa]], where he served as commanding officer.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.britishbattles.com/great-boer-war/mafeking.htm | title = The Siege of Mafeking | publisher = British Battles.com | accessdate = 2006-07-11}}</ref> He successfully defended the town of Mafeking against the [[Boer]]s, who outnumbered his troops eight to one.  Baden-Powell brought together volunteer boys in the town, forming the [[Mafeking Cadet Corps]]. The youths supported the troops by carrying messages, which freed the men for military duties and kept the boys occupied during the long siege. The Cadet Corps performed well, helping in the defense of the town (1899&ndash;1900). Each member received a badge that illustrated a combined compass point and spearhead. The badge's logo was similar to the [[fleur-de-lis]] that Scouting later adopted as its international symbol.

As a result of his determined and successful defense of the town, Baden-Powell became a [[national hero]] in the United Kingdom. His 1899 military training manual, ''Aids to Scouting'', became a [[bestseller]] and was used by teachers and youth organizations.<ref name="NPG">{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/wobaden.asp |title=Robert Baden-Powell: Defender of Mafeking and Founder of the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides | work = Past Exhibition Archive | publisher = [[National Portrait Gallery]] | accessdate= 2006-12-03}}</ref>

In July 1906, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] sent Baden-Powell a copy of his book ''The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians''. Seton, a British-born [[Canada|Canadian]] living in the United States, met Baden-Powell in October 1906, and they shared ideas about youth training programs.<ref name="SetonWoo">{{cite web | last = Woo | first = Randy | year = Aug 1996 | url = http://members.aol.com/randywoo/bsahis/seton.htm | title = Ernest Thompson Seton  | work = The Ultimate Boy Scouts of America History Site | publisher = Randy Woo | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name="SetonInfed>{{cite web | year = 2002 | url = http://www.infed.org/thinkers/seton.htm | title = Ernest Thompson Seton and Woodcraft | publisher = InFed | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name="BPInfed>{{cite web | year = 2002 | url = http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-bp.htm | title = Robert Baden-Powell as and Educational Innovator | publisher = InFed | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref>

Thanks to its popularity, Baden-Powell rewrote ''Aids to Scouting'' for younger readers. By 1907 he had finished a draft called ''Boy Patrols''. The same year, to test his ideas an outdoor program for boys based on military scouting, he founded the Scouting movement by gathering 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds and holding a week-long camp in August, on [[Brownsea Island Scout Camp|Brownsea Island]] in [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]], England.<ref>{{cite book| | author = Woolgar, Brian| coauthors = La Riviere, Sheila| year = 2002| title = Why Brownsea? The Beginnings of Scouting | publisher = Brownsea Island Scout and Guide Management Committee}}</ref>  His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training, allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader.<ref>{{cite web | author = Johnny Walker| url = http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/brownsea.htm| title = Scouting Milestones - Brownsea Island| accessdate = 2006-07-07}}</ref>

In the autumn of 1907, with his draft publication and a successful camp behind him, Baden-Powell went on an extensive speaking tour arranged by his publisher, [[Cyril Arthur Pearson|Arthur Pearson]], to promote his forthcoming book, ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' (the youth version of ''Aids to Scouting''). ''Scouting for Boys'' first appeared in England in January 1908 as six fortnightly installments, and was published in England later in 1908 in book form. The book is now the fourth-bestselling title of all time,<ref name="bestseller">{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2005| url = http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/ | title = The birth of an idea  | work = The History of Scouting | publisher = The Scout Association | accessdate = 2006-12-12}}</ref>
and is now commonly considered the first version of the ''Boy Scout Handbook''.<ref name="firstpub">{{cite web | last = Baden-Powell | first = Robert | year = 1998 | url = http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bp-scouting-for-boys.htm | title = Baden-Powell, Scouting for Boys, 1908  | work = | publisher = Pinetreeweb.com | accessdate = 2006-12-09}}</ref> 

At the time, Baden-Powell intended that the book would provide ideas for established organizations, in particular the Boys' Brigade, whose founder, [[William Alexander Smith (Boys Brigade)|William A. Smith]], he was assisting.<ref name="petersonsmith">{{cite web | last = Peterson | first = Robert | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = Oct 2003 | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0310/d-wwas.html | title = Another youth organization, the Boys' Brigade, was flourishing when the first official troops of the Boy Scouts of America appeared in 1910 | format = | work = Scouting Magazine | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}</ref> However, boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols and flooded Baden-Powell with requests for assistance. He encouraged them, and the Scouting movement developed momentum. As the movement grew, [[Sea Scout]], [[Air Scout]], and other specialized units were added to the program.

===Growth===
[[Image:Olave St Clair Soames.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Olave Baden-Powell]]]]
The Boy Scout movement swiftly established itself throughout the [[British Empire]] soon after the publication of ''Scouting for Boys''. The first recognized overseas unit was chartered in [[Gibraltar]] in 1908, followed quickly by a unit in [[Malta]]. [[Scouts Canada|Canada]] became the first overseas [[dominion]] with a sanctioned Boy Scout program, followed by [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and South Africa. [[Chile]] was the first country outside the British dominions to have a recognized Scouting program. By 1910, [[Argentina]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]],  [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Malaya]], [[Mexico]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], and the United States had Boy Scouts.<ref name="bsahist97">{{cite web | last = Snowden | first = Jeff | year = 1984 | url = http://www.troop97.net/bsahist1.htm | title = A Brief Background of Scouting in the United States 1910 to Today | publisher = Troop 97 | accessdate = 2006-07-22}}</ref><ref name="woohist">{{cite web | last = Woo | first = Randy | url = http://members.aol.com/RandyWoo/bsahis/ | title = The Ultimate Boy Scouts of America History Site | accessdate = 2006-07-22}}</ref><ref name="scoutbase">{{cite web | url = http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/ | title = The History of Scouting | publisher = ScoutBaseUK | accessdate = 2006-07-22}}</ref> The first Scout rally, held in 1910 at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London, attracted 10,000 boys and a number of girls.

The program initially focused on boys aged 11 to 18, but as the movement grew, the need became apparent for leader training and programs for younger boys, older boys, and girls. The first programs for [[Cub Scouts]], [[Explorers]], and Rover Scouts were in place by the late [[1910s]]. They operated independently until they obtained official recognition from their home country's Scouting organization. In the United States, attempts at Cub programs began as early as 1911, but official recognition was not obtained until 1930.<ref name="scoutbase" /><ref name="cubusahist">{{cite web | url = http://www.geocities.com/~pack215/hist-cshistory.html | title = The Evolution of Cubbing, A 90 Year Chronology  | publisher = Cubbing through the Decades | accessdate = 2006-07-22}}</ref><ref name="cubusahist2">{{cite web | url = http://www.sfbac.org/about/a_cs_history.cfm | title = Cub Scouting History  | publisher = San Francisco Bay Area Councils | accessdate = 2006-07-22}}</ref><ref name="roverworld">{{cite web | url = http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/rovers.htm | title = Rover Scouts - Scouting For Men | publisher = Scouting Milestones | accessdate = 2006-07-22}}</ref>

Girls wanted to become part of the movement almost as soon as it began. Baden-Powell and his sister [[Agnes Baden-Powell]] introduced the [[Girl Guides]] in 1910, a parallel movement for girls. Guides are known as [[Girl Scouts]] in the United States, Japan, and elsewhere. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds, later renamed [[Brownies (Girl Guides)|Brownies]] for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert's wife [[Olave Baden-Powell]], who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards. By the 1990s, most Scout associations had become co-educational.<ref name="gsusahist"> {{cite web | url = http://www.qas-church.org/qas_gs.htm#WAGGS | title = History of Girl Scout Organization | publisher = Girl Scouts of the USA | accessdate = 2006-07-22}}</ref>

Baden-Powell could not single-handedly advise all groups who requested his assistance. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London in 1910 and in Yorkshire in 1911. Baden-Powell wanted the training to be as practical as possible to encourage other adults to take leadership roles, so the [[Wood Badge]] course was developed to recognize adult leadership training. The development of the training was delayed by [[World War I]], so the first Wood Badge course was not held until 1919.<ref name="wbfounding">{{cite web | last = Block | first = Nelson R. | year = 1994 | url = http://www.woodbadge.org/founding.htm | title = The Founding of Wood Badge | publisher = Woodbadge.org | accessdate = 2006-07-20}}</ref> Wood Badge is used by Boy Scout associations and combined Boy Scout and Girl Guide associations in many countries.  [[Gilwell Park]] near [[London]] was purchased in 1919 on behalf of [[The Scout Association]] as an adult training site and Scouting [[campsite]].<ref name="historyofficial">{{cite book | last = Rogers | first = Peter | title = Gilwell Park: A Brief History and Guided Tour | year = 1998 | publisher = [[The Scout Association]] | location = London, England | language= English | pages = pages 5-46}}</ref> Baden-Powell wrote a book, ''Aids to Scoutmastership'', to help [[Leader (Scouting)|Scouting Leader]]s, and wrote other handbooks for the use of the new Scouting sections, such as [[Cub Scouts]] and [[Girl Guides]]. One of these was ''Rovering to Success'', written for [[Rover Scouts]] in 1922. A wide range of leader training exists in 2006, from basic to program-specific, including the Wood Badge training.

===Influences===
[[Image:CoolidgeBoyScouts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|U.S. President [[Calvin Coolidge]] greets 1500 Boy Scouts making an annual pilgrimage to the Capitol, 1927]]
Important elements of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell's experiences in  education and military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, from all parts of society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated.  Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys' Brigade and the left-wing, non-militaristic [[Woodcraft Folk]]; however, they were never able to match the development and growth of Scouting.<ref name="woodfolk">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.troop97.net/scout_like.htm| title = Scout-like Organizations | publisher = Troop 97 | accessdate = 2006-12-05}}</ref> 

Aspects of Scouting practice have been criticized as too militaristic.<ref name="militarism">{{cite web | last = Foster | first = Rev. Michael | year = 1997 | url = http://www.netpages.free-online.co.uk/sha/military.htm | title = MILITARISM AND THE SCOUT MOVEMENT |work = Scout History | publisher = Scout History Association | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> Military-style uniforms, badges of rank, flag ceremonies, and brass bands were commonly accepted in the early years because they were a part of normal society, but since then have been watered down or abandoned in both Scouting and society.

Local influences have also been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting has been able to find acceptance in a wide variety of cultures.  In America, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the [[India|Indian]] subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, [[Akela]] (whose name was also appropriated for the [[Webelos (Boy Scouts of America)|Webelos]]), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.<ref name="junglebookhist">{{cite web | last = Dowling | first = Darren | year = 1993 | url = http://www.scoutingresources.org.uk/jungle_index.html | title = Jungle Book |work = | publisher = Scouting Resources | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>


The name "Scouting" seems to have been inspired by the important and romantic role played by military scouts performing reconnaissance in the wars of the time. In fact, Baden-Powell wrote his original military training book, ''Aids To Scouting'', because he saw the need for the improved training of British military-enlisted scouts, particularly in initiative, self-reliance, and observational skills.  The book's popularity with young boys surprised him. As he adapted the book as ''Scouting for Boys'', it seems natural that the movement adopted the names ''Scouting'' and ''Boy Scouts.''<ref name="surprise">{{cite web | last = Walker | first = "Johnny" | year = 2006 | url = http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/sfb.htm | title = ''Scouting for Boys'' - the Influences, the Means, the Process and its Success |work = | publisher = Scouting Milestones | accessdate = 2006-12-05}}</ref>

"Duty to God" is a principle of Scouting worldwide, though it is applied differently among countries.<ref name="faqs">{{cite web | year = 1998 | url = http://www.faqs.org/faqs/scouting/rec.scouting.issues/section-11.html | title = What was Baden-Powell's position on God and Religion in Scouting? | publisher = Faqs | accessdate = 2006-12-03}}</ref><ref name="inquiry">{{cite web | last = Baden-Powell | first = Robert | year = 1912 | url = http://www.inquiry.net/ideals/b-p/religion.htm | title = Baden-Powell on Religion| publisher = Inquiry.net | accessdate = 2006-12-03}}</ref> The [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA) take a strong position, excluding atheists.<ref name="duty">{{cite web| url=http://www.bsalegal.org/dutytogo-155.htm|work= BSA Legal Issues |title=Duty to God| publisher = Boy Scouts of America |accessdate=2006-12-03}}</ref> The [[The Scout Association|United Kingdom Scout Association]] requires adult leaders to acknowledge a higher power, but does not necessarily exclude atheists from roles in Scouting, as long as the local Commissioner is satisfied that the applicant leader will support the values of Scouting and the investigation of faith by the young people in the movement.

==Movement characteristics==
Scouting is taught using the [[Scout method]], which incorporates an informal educational system that emphasizes practical activities in the outdoors. Programs exist for Scouts ranging in age from 6 to 25 (though age limits vary slightly by country), and program specifics target Scouts in a manner appropriate to their age.<ref name="constitution">{{cite web | year = April 2000 | url = http://www.scout.org/wsrc/ll/docs/constitution_E.pdf | title = Constitution of WOSM | format = PDF | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 2006-07-10 | pages = p. 2&ndash;15}}</ref><ref name="goodturn">{{cite web | year = 1998 | url = http://www.scout.org/wsrc/ll/docs/ScoutEducSyst_E.pdf | title = Scouting: An Educational System | format = PDF | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 2006-07-10| pages = p. 9}}</ref> It is the use of the Scout method that binds Scouts together, worldwide.

===Scout method===
[[Image:Faroe stamp 033 girls guide.jpg|thumb|200px|Girl Guides commemorative]]
The Scout method is the principal method by which the Scouting organizations, boy and girl, operate their units.  The [[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM) describes Scouting as "...a voluntary nonpolitical educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of origin, race or creed, in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by the Founder..."<ref name="constitution" /> It is the goal of Scouting "to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities."<ref name="constitution" />

The principles of Scouting describe a code of behavior for all members, and characterize the movement. The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals, comprising four elements:

*[[Scout Law]] and [[Scout Promise]] (Scout Oath)
*Learning by doing
*Development of small groups 
*Progressive and attractive programs of different activities

The Scout Law and Oath embody the joint values of the Scouting movement worldwide and bind all Scouting associations together. The emphasis on "learning by doing" provides experiences and hands-on orientation as a practical method of learning and building self-confidence. Small groups build unity, camaraderie, and a close-knit fraternal atmosphere. These experiences along with an emphasis on trustworthiness and personal honor help to develop [[responsibility]], [[character]], [[self-reliance]], [[self-confidence]], [[reliability]], and [[Preparedness|readiness]]; which eventually lead to [[collaboration]] and [[leadership]]. A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout's horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group. Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as [[dexterity]]. In an outdoor setting, they also provide contact with the natural environment.<ref name="goodturn" /> 

Since the birth of Scouting in 1907, Scouts worldwide have taken a Scout Promise or Oath to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribe to the Scout Law. The form of the promise and laws have varied slightly by country and over time, but must fulfil the requirements of the WOSM to qualify a National Scout Association for membership.

The [[Be Prepared|Scout motto]], 'Be Prepared', has been used in various languages by millions of Scouts since 1907. Less well-known is the [[Boy Scouts of America#Ideals|Scout Slogan]], 'Do a good turn daily'.

===Activities===
[[Image:Scout mem jamb 1979 1980 perry lakes gnangarra.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sculpture erected in 1982 to commemorate the 1979 Jamboree at [[Floreat, Western Australia|Perry Lakes]] [[Western Australia]] and 75 years of Scouting.]]
Common ways to implement the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing good citizenship and decision-making by young people in an age-appropriate manner. Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities is a key element. Primary activities include [[camping]], [[woodcraft]], [[aquatics]], [[hiking]], [[backpacking]], and [[sports]].<ref name="vision">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.scouting.org/nav/enter.jsp?s=mc&c=mv | title =Mission Statement and Vision Statement | format = | work = | publisher =Boy Scouts of America | accessdate =2006-10-10}}</ref><ref name="mbcom">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url =http://www.meritbadge.com/info/aims.htm | title =Boy Scout Aims and Methods | format = | work = | publisher = Meritbadge.com | accessdate =2006-10-27}}</ref>  

Camping is most often arranged at the unit level, such as one Boy Scout troop, but there are periodic "[[camporee]]s" and "[[jamboree (Scouting)|jamboree]]s".  Camporees occur a few times a year and involve units from a local area camping together for a weekend.  The events usually have a theme, such as [[pioneering]]. [[World Scout Moot]]s are camporees, mainly focused on Scouters. Jamborees are large national or international events held every four years, during which thousands of Scouts camp together for one or two weeks. Activities at these events include games, scoutcraft competitions, [[Scouting memorabilia collecting|badge, pin or patch trading]], aquatics, woodcarving, archery, rifle and shotgun shooting, and activities related to the theme of the event.<ref name="2007act">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://eng.scouting2007.org/activities/ | title = 2007 One World One Promise | format = | work = World Centenary Activities | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate =2006-12-07}}</ref>  

For Scouts and Scouters, the highlight of the year is spending at least a week in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on merit badges, advancement, and perfecting scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as [[sailing]], backpacking, [[canoeing]] and [[whitewater]], [[caving]], and [[fishing]].

===Uniforms and distinctive insignia===
:''Individual national or other emblems may be found at the individual country's Scouting article, and/or at [[Gallery of Scout and Guide national emblems]].''
[[Image:Ideal Scout.png|thumb|200px|''Ideal Scout'' sculpture by [[R. Tait McKenzie]].]]
The Scout [[uniform]] is a widely recognized characteristic of Scouting. In the words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, it "hides all differences of social standing in a country and makes for equality; but, more important still, it covers differences of country and race and creed, and makes all feel that they are members with one another of the one great brotherhood".<ref name="uniform">{{cite web | last = Wade | first = E.K. | year = 1957 | url = http://pinetreeweb.com/wade12.htm | title = 27 Years With Baden-Powell | format = PDF | work = Why the Uniform?, ch 12 | publisher = Pinetree.web | accessdate = 2006-07-24}}</ref> The original uniform, still widely recognized, consisted of a [[khaki]] button-up shirt, shorts, and a broad-brimmed [[campaign hat]]. Baden-Powell also wore shorts, because he believed that being dressed like a Scout helped to reduce the age-imposed distance between adult and youth. Uniforms are now frequently blue, orange, red or green, and shorts are replaced by long trousers in winter, and in areas where the culture calls for modesty.

Distinctive insignia for all are Scout uniforms, recognized and worn the world over, include the Wood Badge and the World Membership Badge. Scouting has two internationally known symbols: the [[fleur-de-lis]] is used by member organizations of the WOSM, and the [[trefoil]] by members of the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS).<ref name="fleurwosm">{{cite web | url = http://www.scout.org/ | title = Scouts Creating a Better World | publisher = World Organization of the Scout Movement | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name="worldtrefoil">{{cite web | url = http://www.wagggsworld.org/en/resources/photos/54 | title = The World Trefoil | publisher = World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref> (While these are the largest boy and girl Scouting associations, not all Scouts or Scouting associations belong to them.)

The [[swastika]] was used as an early symbol by the [[The Scout Association|British Boy Scouts]] and others. According to "Johnny" Walker, its earliest use in Scouting was on the Thanks Badge introduced in 1911.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.scouting.milestones.btinternet.co.uk/badges.htm | work = Scouting milestones | title = Early Badge use | accessdate = 2006-01-10}}</ref> Lord Baden-Powell's 1922 design for the Medal of Merit added a swastika to the Scout fleur-de-lis to symbolize good luck for the recipient. Like Rudyard Kipling, he would have come across this symbol in India. In 1934, Scouters requested a change to the design because of the use of the swastika by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]]. A new British Medal of Merit was issued in 1935.

==Age groups and sections==
{{main|Age Groups in Scouting and Guiding}}
Scouting and Guiding movements are generally divided into sections by age or school grade, allowing activities to be tailored to the maturity of the group. These age divisions have varied over time in Scouting and Guiding as they adapt to their culture and environment.

Scouting was originally developed for young [[adolescent]]s, generally aged 11&ndash;17.  In most member organizations, the [[Boy Scout|Scout]] or [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Guide]] section is designated to this age group. In the following years, programs were developed to meet the needs of young children (generally 6&ndash;10), and young adults (originally 18 and older, later up to 25). In many member organizations Scouts and Guides were later split into "junior" and "senior" sections. Some member organizations dropped the section for young adults. Exact age ranges and programs vary between countries and associations.<ref name="bsasections">{{cite web | url = http://www.scouting.org/ | title = Boy Scouts of America, National Council | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name="britsections">{{cite web | url = http://www.scouts.org.uk/ | title = The Scout Association, Official UK Website | publisher = The Scout Association | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref><ref name="ggsections">{{cite web | url = http://www.girlguiding.org.uk/ | title = Girlguiding UK Home and welcome | publisher = Girl Guiding UK | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref>

The Scout Method has also been adapted to specific programs such as [[Air Scouts]], [[Sea Scouts]], Rider Guides and Scoutingbands.

Many organizations also have a program for members with special needs. This is usually known as [[Extension Scouting]], but sometimes has other names, such as [[Scoutlink (UK)|Scoutlink]]. 

In many countries, Scouting is organized into neighborhood Scout Groups, or Districts, which contain one or more sections. Under the umbrella of the Scout Group are sections divided according to age, each with their own terminology and leadership structures.

==Adults and leadership==
[[Image:Baden-powell1.jpg|thumb|200px|Baden Powell]]
Adults interested in Scouting or Guiding, including former Scouts and Guides, often join organizations such as the [[International Scout and Guide Fellowship]]. In the United States or the [[Philippines]], university students might join the co-ed service fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]].  In the United Kingdom university students might join the [[Student Scout and Guide Organisation]] and after graduation the [[Scout and Guide Graduate Association]].

Scout units are generally operated by adult volunteers. These may be parents, former Scouts, students, or community leaders such as teachers or religious leaders. [[Scout Leader]]ship positions are often divided between 'uniform' and 'lay' positions. Uniformed leaders have received formal training such as the [[Wood Badge]] and received a warrant for a rank within the organization, while lay members range from part time roles such as meeting helpers, committee members and advisors, to a small number of full-time professionals.<ref name="trooporg">{{cite web | year = April 2000 | url = http://usscouts.org/boyscouts/bstroop.html | title = Troop Organization | publisher = US Scouts.org | accessdate = 2006-07-26}}, p. 2-15</ref><ref name="adultfacts">{{cite web | url = http://www.scouts.org.uk/join/adultfacts.html | title = Facts about adults in Scouting | publisher = The Scout Association | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>

Within a unit are uniformed positions such as [[Scoutmaster]] and assistants. Their titles vary from country to country. In some countries units are supported by lay members ranging from meeting helpers to members of a unit committee.<ref name="commguide">{{cite book | year = 1990 | title = BSA Troop Committee Guidebook | publisher = Boy Scouts of America | location = Irving, TX | id = ISBN 0-8395-6505-4}}</ref> In some Scout associations, the committee members may also wear uniforms and be registered Scout leaders.

Above the unit are further uniformed positions, called Commissioners, at levels such as district, county, council or province, depending on the structure of the national organization. They also work along with lay teams and professionals. Training teams and other related functions are often formed at these levels. In the UK and other countries, the national Scout organizations appoints a Chief Scout as the most senior uniformed member.

==Around the world==
Following its foundation in the United Kingdom (UK), Scouting spread around the globe. The first association outside the UK was opened in Malta. In most countries of the world now there is at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent but international cooperation continues to be seen as part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body it organizes the [[World Scout Jamboree]] every four years.<ref name="worldjambo">{{cite web | last = | first = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.scout.org/en/information_events/events/world_events/world_jamboree/jamborees_history | title = World Scout Jamborees History |work = | publisher = WOSM | accessdate = 2006-12-05}}</ref>

In 1928 the WAGGGS started as the equivalent to WOSM for the then female-only national Scouting/Guiding organizations. It is also responsible for the various international centres such as [[Our Chalet]]. 

Today at the international level, the two largest umbrella organizations are:
*[[World Organization of the Scout Movement]] (WOSM), for boys-only and [[Coeducation|co-educational]] organizations.
*[[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]] (WAGGGS), primarily for girls-only organizations but also accepting co-educational organizations.

===Co-educational===
[[Image:1996-Rover_Moot-Fahnengru<U+00DF>.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Scouts and Guides from different countries on [[World Scout Moot]], Sweden, 1996]]
Worldwide there have been different approaches to co-educational Scouting. Countries such as the USA have maintained separate Scouting organizations for boys and girls.<ref name="bsagirls">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/girls-top.html | title = BSA and Girls in Scouting | format = | work = | publisher = BSA Discrimination.org | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>  In other countries, notably in Europe, Scouting and Guiding have merged, and there is a single organization for boys and girls, which is a member of both the WOSM and the WAGGGS.<ref name="canadagirls">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gender_policy.html | title = Scouts Canada Policy on Girls | format = | work = | publisher = BSA Discrimination.org | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref><ref name="germanygirls">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2005 | url = http://n2zgu.50megs.com/GER.htm | title = Scouting in Germany | format = | work = | publisher = 50megs.com | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> In others, for example, Australia and the United Kingdom, the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls, but is only a member of the WOSM, while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS. In Slovenia, Spain and Greece, it is the other way around, as the national Guide association has opted to admit both boys and girls, and the national Scout association has remained a separate movement.

The Scout Association of the United Kingdom has been co-educational at all levels since 1991, but this has been optional for groups and currently 52% of groups have at least one female youth member. Since 2000 new sections have been required to accept girls. The Scout Association has decided that all Scout groups and sections will become co-educational by January 2007, the year of Scouting's centenary.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = Oct 2005 | url = http://www.edinburgh-scout.org.uk/cesan/cesan-2005-10.pdf | title = CESAN | format = {{PDFlink|208KB}} | work = City of Ediburgh Scout Association Newsletter | publisher = City of Ediburgh Scout Association | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref>

In the United States, Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts are boys-only, however, for youths age 14 and older, the [[Venturing]] program is co-educational. The [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] (GSUSA) is an independent organization for girls and young women. Adult leadership positions in the BSA and the GSUSA are open to both men and women.

===Breakaway and non-aligned organizations=== 
[[Image:Harcerki.png|thumb|right|200px|Polish Girl Guides]] 
{{main|Scouting in breakaway and non-aligned organisations}}
Fifteen years passed between the first publication of ''Scouting for Boys'' and the creation of the first supranational Scout organization, WOSM, and millions of copies had been sold in dozens of languages. By that point, Scouting was the purview of the world's youth, and hard to preserve as a monolith. 

Alternative groups have formed since the original formation of the Scouting "Boy Patrols." They can be a result of groups or individuals who refuse to follow the original ideals of Scouting but still desire to participate in Scout-like activities.  Others maintain that the WOSM is currently far more political and less youth-based than ever envisioned by Lord Baden-Powell. They believe that Scouting in general has moved away from its original intent, because of political machinations that happen to longstanding organizations, and seek to return to the earliest, simplest methods.<ref name="trad">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.inquiry.net/traditional/index.htm | title = Traditional Scouting | format = | work = | publisher = American Traditional Scouting | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref><ref name="bpscouts">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | url = http://www.traditionalscouting.co.uk/ | title = The Baden - Powell Scouts' Association | format = | work = | publisher = The Baden - Powell Scouts' Association | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>  

There are at least 520 separate national or regional Scouting associations in the world. Most have felt the need to create international Scouting organizations to set standards for Scouting and to coordinate activities among member associations. Six international Scouting organizations serve 437 of the world's national associations, and the largest two organizations, WOSM and WAGGGS, count 362 national associations as members, encompassing the vast majority of the world's Scouts.<ref name="breakaway">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.troop97.net/wrldsct1.htm | title = All Scouting Associations in Every Country | format = | work = | publisher = Troop 97 | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> 

Breakaway and nonaligned organizations can be divided into four categories: [[Scouts-in-Exile]], independent Scouts and Scout organizations, Scout-like youth organizations, political and military youth organizations.

===Controversies and concerns===
{{main|Scouting controversies and concerns}}
Since Scouting's inception in the early [[1900s]], it has sometimes become entangled in social [[controversies]] such as the [[civil rights]] struggle in the [[American South]] and in nationalist [[resistance movements]] in [[India]]. Scouting was introduced to [[Africa]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] officials as a way to strengthen their rule, but came to challenge the legitimacy of the [[British Empire]] as African Scouts used the Scout Law's principle that a Scout is a brother to all other Scouts to claim full imperial citizenship for African Scouts and [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]] amongst all Scouts.<ref name="movement">{{cite web | last = Foster | first = Rev.

==In film and the arts==
{{main|Scouting in popular culture}}
[[Image:Indiana Jones and the Cross of Coronado.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Young [[Life Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Life Scout]] [[Indiana Jones]] ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''.]] 
As Scouting has been a facet of culture throughout most of the 20th century, numerous films and artwork use the subject.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dubill| first=Andy| year=2005| title=Scouts On The Silver Screen| journal=International Scouting Collectors Association Journal (ISCA Journal) | volume=5| issue=2| pages=28-31}}</ref> It is especially prevalent in the United States, where Scouting is tied closely to the ideal of [[Americana]]. The works of painters [[Norman Rockwell]] and [[Joseph Csatari]] and the 1966 film ''[[Follow Me, Boys!]]'' are prime examples of this idealized American ethos. Scouting is often dealt with in a humorous manner, as in the 1989 film ''[[Troop Beverly Hills]]'' and the 2005 film ''[[Down and Derby]]'', and is often fictionalized so that the audience knows the topic is Scouting without any mention of Scouting by name. Scouting appears in the popular culture of countries besides America too. In 1980 [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[singer]] and [[songwriter]] [[Gerry Rafferty]] recorded ''I was a Boy Scout'' as part of his ''Snakes and Ladders'' album.<ref name="I was">{{cite web | year = 1980 | url = http://www.metrolyrics.com/i-was-a-boy-scott-lyrics-gerry-rafferty.html | title = Gerry Rafferty - I was a Boy Scout | work = Song lyrics | accessdate = 2006-12-08}}</ref>
