'''Stephen Henry Lewis''', [[Order of Canada|CC]] (born November 11, 1937) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] politician, broadcaster and [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. He was the leader of the [[democratic socialism | democratic socialist]] [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] for most of the 1970s. During many of the those years as leader, his father [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]] was simultaneously the leader of the Federal [[New Democratic Party]]. After politics, he became a broadcaster on both [[CBC Radio]], and Toronto's [[CityTV]]. In the mid-1980s, he was appointed as Canada's [[United Nations]] ambassador, by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister, [[Brian Mulroney]]. He quit in 1988 and worked at various United Nations agencies during the 1990s. In the 2000s, he served a term as the United Nations' [[special envoy]] for [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]. He is currently Social Science Scholar-in-Residence at [[McMaster University]], in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. In 2002, he was invested into the [[Order of Canada]].

==Early life and education==

==Political career==
He left his studies in the 1960s and took up a clerical position with the [[Socialist International]], where he received an invitation to a conference in Ghana. He attended, and instead of returning to Canada, spent more than a year working, traveling, and teaching in various places in Africa. He recalled in his 2005 [[Massey Lectures]] that the relatively brief sojourn would be a key influence on his life, especially after the turn of the new millennium.

He came back to Canada at the instigation of [[Tommy Douglas]], and in 1963, at the age of 26, he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. Following the engineered 1970 resignation of [[Donald C. MacDonald]],<ref>MacDonald, pp. 151-152</ref> Lewis was elected leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]]. His initial experience at the helm in the [[Ontario general election, 1971|1971 provincial election]] was a disappointment, with the party slipping from 20 seats to 19. 

A radical left wing group nicknamed [[The Waffle]] had gained prominence, with one of its leaders, [[James Laxer]] winning one-third of the vote when he ran to be leader of the federal NDP in 1971. Lewis felt that The Waffle was threatening the credibility and stability of the party and supported a movement against the group in June 1972 on the basis that it was a ''party within a party''.<ref name="waffle ends">McLeod & McLeod, pp.360-362</ref>

Lewis led a strong campaign during the [[Ontario general election, 1975|1975 election]] with his oratory and passion bringing new supporters to the party. The NDP highlighted issues such as rent control and workplace safety. Each day, Lewis told the story of a different Ontarian in trouble, making a case that this was because of the lack of adequate legislation. Polls showed the NDP surging and the incumbent [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] in freefall and in the course of the campaign [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Bill Davis|William Davis]] was forced to commit his party to bringing in [[rent control]] and other progressive reforms in order to retain power. When the ballots were counted the Tories were reduced to a [[minority government]]. Lewis' NDP had doubled its seats from 19 to 38, surpassing the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] to become the [[Official Opposition]]. To some it appeared that it was only a matter of time before the NDP would form the government.

The next election, in [[Ontario general election, 1977|1977]], proved to be a disappointment. The growth of support for the NDP stalled, and while the Tories were kept to a minority, the NDP failed to make any gains. The party was reduced to 33 seats and lost its status as Official Opposition to the Liberals. In 1978, a frustrated Lewis stepped down as party leader and as a [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]].

==Diplomatic and Academic Career==
[[Image:Stephen-Lewis 2006-01-30.jpg|thumb|250 px|Stephen Lewis, speaking at the [[University of Alberta]], January 30, 2006]]

After working for several years as a labour mediator, columnist and broadcaster, in 1984 Lewis was appointed Canadian [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|Ambassador]] to the [[United Nations]] by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauv<U+00E9>]], on the advice of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]]. Lewis served at the post until 1988. In the 1980s, he became a familiar voice appearing  with [[Dalton Camp]] and [[Eric Kierans]] as part of a weekly political panel on [[Peter Gzowski]]'s [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio show, ''[[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]]''.

From 1995 to 1999, Lewis was Deputy Director of [[UNICEF]]. From 2001 until 2006, he worked as United Nations [[UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa|Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]]. In his role as Special Envoy, he worked to draw attention to the HIV/AIDS crisis and to convince leaders and the public that they have a responsibility to respond. He has been widely praised for his effectiveness in this role. In 2005 he adapted his [[Massey Lectures]] in a book titled "[[Race Against Time (Lewis)|Race Against Time]]", where he describes the disjuncture between what the international community promises and their actions in responding to the pandemic in Africa.

In May 2006, Lewis joined the Faculty of Social Sciences at [[McMaster University]] as a Scholar-in-Residence. Also in 2006, an online petition asking the Nobel committee to recognize Lewis for his work, and consider him for the 2007 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], was signed by over 12,000 people, it was unsuccessful thus far.[http://www.nsb.com/whatsnew.asp?i_newsid=634]

In 2009, Lewis strongly criticized [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s assertion that condom use only makes the AIDS crisis worse.<ref>[http://www.stephenlewisfoundation.org/news_item.cfm?news=2740 Pope's condom remarks 'real tragedy']</ref>

==Foundation==
Lewis heads the Stephen Lewis Foundation, a charitable organization that helps people affected and infected by [[HIV/AIDS]] in Africa.  As a preventative HIV/AIDS strategy, Lewis has made a somewhat controversial call for [[male circumcision]] when African children receive the first of two UN administered [[Measles|Measles vaccination]] shots, so that their recovery progress can be monitored at the time of the second vaccination.<ref name="circumcision">{{Cite web
