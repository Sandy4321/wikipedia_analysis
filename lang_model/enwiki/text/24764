'''''Chuck & Buck''''' is a [[2000 in film|2000]] film written by and starring [[Mike White]], and directed by [[Miguel Arteta]].

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
The film centers on Buck O'Brien ([[Mike White]]), an emotionally arrested man.  At his mother's funeral, Buck is reacquainted with his childhood best-friend, Charlie Sitter ([[Chris Weitz]]), who is now a successful music industry exec with a girlfriend named Carlyn Carlson ([[Beth Colt]]). Throughout the film, cryptic [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s to the [[childhood]] of Charlie and Buck are provided.

During their [[reunion]], Buck tries to initiate a sexual relationship with Charlie (or "Chuck", as Buck remembers him).  Charlie rebuffs him, and returns to [[L.A.]] with Carlyn, promising that Buck is welcome to visit them.

Charlie continually puts off Buck's visits to L.A., claiming family obligations or work difficulties.  Buck withdraws $10,000 from his [[bank]], packs up his car, and moves to L.A., taking up residence in a hotel.

Buck starts trying to see Charlie at Charlie's office at Trimorph Entertainment.  The visits result in  a) Buck being turned away by the building [[receptionist]], and  b) Buck sneaking into the building and then avoiding Charlie for fear of being discovered as a [[stalker]].  Buck also surreptitiously follows Charlie to his home to learn where he lives.

Buck resorts to standing across the street from Charlie's office, in front of the Aeternus Theater, waiting for Charlie to emerge from his office.  Buck eventually approaches the Aeternus's house manager, Beverly Franco ([[Lupe Ontiveros]]) and inquires about putting on a play there.

Buck finally reveals his presence in L.A., surprising Charlie and Carlyn outside a restaurant.  Buck tells them that he is doing a play in L.A., similar to the plays that he and Charlie/Chuck wrote and performed as children (such as ''The Devil and the Reindeer'').  Carlyn invites Buck to a party at their home the next night to celebrate a promotion that Charlie has just received.  Charlie tries to give Buck the wrong time for the party, but Carlyn unwittingly corrects him.

At the party, Buck meets some of Charlie's friends, and many of Buck's guileless answers to their pointed questions are misinterpreted by Chuck's friends as meaningless L.A. doubletalk, to which they respond cheerfully.  Buck continually tells them that he really wants to talk to Charlie.  In contrast, Charlie continually brushes off Buck's attempts at conversation by feigning distractedness or business.

Buck meets Carlyn in her bedroom, and expresses his dismay at the fact that "Charlie wants to hang out with his other friends tonight".  Carlyn reassures Buck that Charlie is really focused on his job, which is why he has been neglecting Buck.

Buck finally corners Charlie in conversation with some of Charlie's friends.  Charlie introduces Buck to some of his friends, and then continues his pattern of blowing off Buck in favor of his other, more influential, friends.

Buck returns to his hotel room, heartbroken and violently angry, and begins to write a play called ''Hank & Frank'' (with "Hank" obviously being Charlie/Chuck, and "Frank" obviously being Buck).  Also, Buck starts to spy on Charlie & Carlyn at their home.

Buck starts to obsessively call Charlie's house, where Carlyn continually provides excuses as to why Charlie can't come to the phone.

Buck returns to the Aeternus Theater and asks Beverly to direct and produce his [[play]], ''Hank and Frank'', at the Aeturnus Theater.  She initially declines, but is won over by Buck's acceptance of her absurd demand to be paid $25 per hour.

Beverly, taking her job seriously, analyzes Buck's play and determines that the play is not a children's play, even though it has children in it.  She says that Buck "has something weird about women" and "something weird about men".  Buck dismisses her analysis, asking, "What kind of TV shows do you watch?"

Buck returns to [[stalking]] Charlie at his office.  Initially, Charlie's personal [[assistant]], Jamilla ([[Maya Rudolph]]), serves as a barrier between Buck and Charlie, but she eventually allows Buck a chance to meet with Charlie.

Charlie, in his office, finally meets with Buck.  The meeting concludes with a brush-off from Charlie, but Buck ends up getting Jamilla to take a posed photo of Buck & Charlie.

Later that night, Buck shows up unannounced at Charlie's place with a photo montage that he has made from childhood pictures, as well as the one that he had acquired from the earlier meeting with Charlie.  Carlyn offers Charlie [[ice cream]], which Charlie accepts.  Later on, Carlyn excuses herself to go to bed, leaving Buck and Charlie alone.  Buck then asks Charlie if he'd like to play a game like they used to play...  specifically, a game where "you stick your dick in my mouth, and I stick mine in yours: Chuck & Buck, suck & fuck."  Charlie's response is, "I think you should get out of here, Buck.  I mean it.  Get out.  Now."  Buck leaves.

Buck goes back to Beverly and presents his recommendations, based on head shots, for the child actors who he thinks should play "Hank" and "Frank" in his play.  Beverly has her own ideas, and introduces to Buck the child actors that she wants.  Buck is happy with her choice for "Hank", but initially rejects her choice for "Frank".  Beverly convinces Buck that her choices are the best, based on the pool of child actors from which they can draw.

Buck continues to spy on Charlie and Carlyn, and, on one occasion, watches through their bedroom window as they have sex.

Beverly and Buck take [[auditions]] for the parts of the adult characters in the play.  Most of Beverly's choices make it into the production, but Buck insists on an awful [[actor]] named Sam ([[Paul Weitz (filmmaker)|Paul Weitz]]) for the part of "Hank", because of the actor's strong resemblance to the real-life Charlie.  ([[Paul Weitz (filmmaker)|Paul Weitz]], who plays Sam, is the real-life brother of [[Chris Weitz]], who plays Charlie.)  Beverly disagrees with Buck on this casting choice, but Buck overrules her, as he is both the writer and financial backer of the play.

Buck continues his attempts to contact Charlie at Trimorph Entertainment, which are deflected by Charlie's assistant, Jamilla.  In tears, Buck confronts Jamilla on the street.  This prompts Charlie to call Buck and chastise him for freaking out Jamilla.  Charlie tells Buck that their friendship was "a long time ago", and that he (Charlie) has a ton of work, and, on top of that, is getting married.  Buck asks if Charlie's coldness is a result of his relationship with Carlyn.  Charlie denies this, and tells Buck that he doesn't know why Buck has fixated on him.  Buck tells Charlie that he ''does'' know.  Charlie tells Buck to stay away from him.

Rehearsals continue for ''Hank & Frank''.  Buck meets Sam, the actor playing "Hank", and the two strike up a friendship.

Buck meets with Beverly again, to discuss the script, and Beverly describes the play as a "[[homoerotic]], [[misogynistic]] love story" between Hank and Frank, a ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''-type duo.  Buck says that he just wanted to write a fairy-tale play like he and Charlie used to write as kids, "like [[Goldilocks]] or [[Little Red Riding Hood]]".

Buck repeatedly calls Charlie at home, but hangs up when Carlyn answers the phone.  Carlyn knows that the caller is Buck, though Charlie feigns ignorance.  When Carlyn confronts Charlie about the calls, Charlie tells her that Buck is "nuts", "like his parents".

Sam, playing "Hank", proves to be difficult in rehearsals.  Sam's poor acting skills threaten to compromise the successful production of the play.

Buck befriends the boy playing the young "Hank".  The boy tries to show off to Buck by lighting off a [[firecracker]].  The firecracker's explosion burns the boy's hand, so his mother pulls him out of the play.  As a result, Beverly recasts the children's roles with the actors who play the adult counterparts.

Buck calls Charlie's office, leaving a message as "Bob Doubleburg", and Charlie unwittingly returns his call.  Buck uses this opportunity to invite Charlie to see ''Hank & Frank''.  Charlie is noncommittal.

The friendship between Sam and Buck continues as the two hang out in Buck's hotel room.  Sam is charmed by Buck's childishness.

Buck follows Carlyn to a restaurant to tell her about his play (''Hank & Frank'').  Carlyn agrees to go, saying that the play sounds "illuminating".  Charlie tries to blow it off, but Carlyn is adamant that they attend.

The night of the play, Buck has reserved two good seats for Charlie and Carlyn, which remain empty as showtime approaches.  Beverly asks for the seats to be given to her sister, but Buck refuses to give them up.  Finally, Charlie and Carlyn arrive and take their seats.

The play begins, and it becomes clear immediately that "Hank" (based on Charlie/Chuck) is the dominant personality in the relationship with "Frank" (based on Buck).  "Hank" quickly comes under the spell of a [[witch]] named "Delilah" (based on Carlyn), who turns "Hank" against "Frank", and makes "Frank" a "[[Disability|cripple]]".  At the end of the play, "Hank" apologizes to "Frank" for coming under the spell of the witch, "Delilah".  The play ends with "Delilah" cackling wickedly.

Charlie, with Carlyn in tow, exits the theater quickly, avoiding Buck.  Carlyn knows that there is "something going on", which Charlie denies.

Beverly receives positive reviews as a director, and the owner of the theater asks her to direct the upcoming performance of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.

Back at Buck's hotel room, Buck tells Sam that Charlie came to the play, but didn't like it.  Sam tells Buck that he (Buck) should move into the apartment across the hall from his own, which has recently been vacated by a woman who was annoyed by Sam's loud parties.  After many beers, Sam falls asleep, and Buck takes the opportunity offered by the "[[sleepover]]" to initiate a sexual relationship with Sam, while Sam is asleep.  Sam wakes up, rebuffs Chuck, and leaves.

Buck arranges a meeting with Carlyn, where he tells her that, when he and Charlie/Chuck were kids, they did "sex things".  Carlyn, surprisingly, tells Buck that she knows all about it, and that such experimental activities are normal with adolescent boys.  Buck retorts that the things they did were "not normal", and that Charlie/Chuck initiated the activities.  Buck tells Carlyn that she is no different from Chuck's house and car, just a [[status symbol]], but that Charlie/Chuck is all that he (Buck) has.  Carlyn tells Buck that he doesn't "have" Charlie/Chuck.  Carlyn offers Buck the phone number of her [[psychotherapist]].

Buck approaches Charlie at a club, interrupting Charlie's meeting with some music promoters.  Buck offers a deal:  "Come home with me tonight... and then you'll never hear from me again."

Buck and Charlie share a night of passion at Buck's hotel room.  Afterward, Buck is reluctant to honor the agreement, but does so at Charlie's insistence.

Buck quickly packs up his hotel room into his car.  Crying, he goes to see Beverly, telling her that there is "no love" for him anymore, and that he misses his mother.  Beverly comforts him, telling him that she, too, is "a mess".

Buck visits Sam at his apartment to apologize for his behavior.  Sam is initially reluctant to accept Buck's apology, but he ends up reminding Buck of the vacancy across the hall, which Buck takes up.

Beverly, with Buck in tow, meets with the owners of the Aeternus Theater, and convinces them to let her do something "meatier", like [[Ibsen]] or [[Chekov]], rather than children's plays.

Buck, living in his new apartment, receives an invitation to the [[wedding]] of Charlie and Carlyn.  On the way out the door to the wedding, Buck runs into Sam, now his neighbor, who compliments him on his appearance.  At the wedding, Buck is oblivious to the advances of an older man, who tries to engage Buck in conversation about the quality of the [[wedding cake]].

The credits roll under [[Gwendolyn]]'s ''Freedom of the Heart''.
