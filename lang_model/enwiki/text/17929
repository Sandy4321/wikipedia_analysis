The society says it is anti-[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], particularly [[anti-socialist]] and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]]. It seeks to limit the powers of government and defends the [[originalism|original intention of the U.S. Constitution]], which it sees as based on [[Christian]] principles. It opposes [[collectivism]], including [[wealth redistribution]], [[economic interventionism]], [[socialism]], [[communism]], and [[fascism]]. In a 1983 edition of ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'', Congressman [[Larry McDonald]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]), then its newly appointed president, characterized the society as belonging to the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] rather than the [[New Right]].<ref name="Larry McDonald on the New World Order">{{Cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=326_1203084840 |title=Larry McDonald on the New World Order |accessdate=2008-07-18 |publisher=[[Liveleak]] |date=2008-02-15}}</ref>

The society opposed aspects of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s because of its concerns that the movement had communists in important positions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The society opposed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], saying it was in violation of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and overstepped the rights of individual states to enact laws regarding [[civil rights]]. The society is against "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|one world government]]", and has an [[immigration reduction]] view on [[immigration reform]]. It opposes the [[United Nations]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), the [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA), the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), and other [[free trade agreement]]s. The society argues that there is a devaluing of the U.S. Constitution in favor of political and economic [[globalization]], and that this trend is not an accident. It cites the existence of the [[Security and Prosperity Partnership]] as evidence of a push towards a [[North American Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thenewamerican.com/node/5524 |title=The North American Union: Conspiracy Theory or Conspiracy Fact? |accessdate=2008-07-18 |first=Brian |last=Farmer |publisher=The John Birch Society |date=2007-09-17}}</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
The society was established in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]] on December 9, 1958, by a group of 12 led by [[Robert Welch, Jr.]], a retired candy manufacturer from [[Belmont, Massachusetts]]. Welch named the new organization after [[John Birch (missionary)|John Birch]], an American [[Baptist]] [[missionary]] and U.S. [[Military intelligence|military intelligence officer]] who was killed by communist forces in China in August 1945, shortly after the conclusion of [[World War II]] - the first American casualty, Welch contended, of the [[Cold War]].

One founding member was [[Fred Koch]], founder of [[Koch Industries]], one of the largest private corporations in America. Another was [[Revilo P. Oliver]], a [[University of Illinois]] professor who later severed his relationship with the society and helped found the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]]. A transcript of Welch's two-day presentation at the founding meeting was published as ''The Blue Book of the John Birch Society,'' and became a cornerstone of its beliefs, with each new member receiving a copy.<ref name="Larry McDonald on the New World Order" />

According to Welch, "both the U.S. and Soviet governments are controlled by the same furtive conspiratorial cabal of internationalists, greedy bankers, and corrupt politicians. If left unexposed, the traitors inside the U.S. government would betray the country's sovereignty to the United Nations for a collectivist [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]], managed by a 'one-world socialist government.{{'"}}<ref>{{Cite book|last = Welch |first = Robert E. |title = Blue Book of the John Birch Society |publisher = American Opinion Books |date = 1961 |isbn = 0-88279-215-6}}</ref><ref name="PublicEye">{{Cite web|url = http://www.publiceye.org/tooclose/jbs.html |title = John Birch Society |accessdate = 2008-07-18 |publisher = [[Political Research Associates]]}}</ref> Welch saw [[collectivism]] as the main threat to [[Western culture|Western Civilization]], and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]s as "secret communist traitors" who provided cover for the gradual process of collectivism, with the ultimate goal of replacing the nations of western civilization with a one-world socialist government. "There are many stages of [[welfarism]], socialism, and collectivism in general," he wrote, "but Communism is the ultimate state of them all, and they all lead inevitably in that direction."<ref name="PublicEye" />

The society's activities include distribution of literature, pamphlets, magazines, videos and other educational material while sponsoring a Speaker's Bureau, which invites "speakers who are keenly aware of the motivations that drive political policy".<ref>[http://www.jbs.org/index.php/action/speakers-bureau John Birch Society Speakers Bureau]</ref> One of the first public activities of the society was a "Get US Out!" (of membership in the [[United Nations|UN]]) campaign, which claimed in 1959 that the "Real nature of [the] UN is to build a One World Government."<ref>{{Cite book|author1 = Matthew Lyons |author2 = Chip Berlet |title = Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort |publisher = The Guilford Press |location = New York |date = 2000 |pages = 179 |isbn = 1-57230-562-2}}</ref> In 1960, Welch advised JBS members to: "Join your local [[Parent-Teacher Association|P.T.A.]] at the beginning of the school year, get your conservative friends to do likewise, and go to work to take it over."<ref>{{Cite book|last = French |first = William Marshall |title = American Secondary Education |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=180bAAAAMAAJ |accessdate = 2008-07-20 |date = 1967 |publisher = Odyssey Press |pages = 477}}</ref> ''One Man's Opinion'', a magazine launched by Welch in 1956, was renamed ''American Opinion,'' and became the society's official publication. The society publishes the journal ''The New American'' on a biweekly basis<!-- two weeks, ie fortnightly -->.<ref name="newamerican" />

===1960s===
By March 1961 the society had 60,000 to 100,000 members and, according to Welch, "a staff of 28 people in the Home Office; about 30 Coordinators (or Major Coordinators) in the field, who are fully paid as to salary and expenses; and about 100 Coordinators (or Section Leaders as they are called in some areas), who work on a volunteer basis as to all or part of their salary, or expenses, or both." According to Political Research Associates, a "progressive think tank devoted to supporting movements that are building a more just and inclusive democratic society",<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.publiceye.org/tooclose/jbs.html | title = Public Eye on The John Birch Society }}</ref> the society "pioneered grassroots lobbying, combining educational meetings, petition drives and letter-writing campaigns. One early campaign against the second summit between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] generated over 600,000 postcards and letters, according to the society. A June 1964 society campaign to oppose [[Xerox]] corporate sponsorship of TV programs favorable to the UN produced 51,279 letters from 12,785 individuals."<ref name="PublicEye" />

In the 1960s Welch insisted that the Johnson administration's fight against communism in Vietnam was part of a communist plot aimed at taking over the United States. Welch demanded that the United States get out of Vietnam, thus aligning the Society with the far left.<ref>Stephen Earl Bennett, "Modes of Resolution of a 'Belief Dilemma' in the Ideology of the John Birch Society," ''Journal of Politics'' 1971 33(3): 735-772.</ref>

The JBS was moderately active in the 1960s with numerous chapters, but rarely engaged in coalition building with other conservatives. Indeed, it was rejected by most conservatives because of the Welch's conspiracy theories. [[Ayn Rand]] said in a ''[[Playboy]]'' interview that "What is wrong with them is that they don't seem to have any specific, clearly defined political philosophy... I consider the Birch Society futile, because they are not for [[Capitalism]] but merely against Communism."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ellensplace.net/ar_pboy.html |title = Who was Ayn Rand? - a biography, Playboy interview, 1964 |accessdate = 2008-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth--836-The_Lost_Parts_Ayn_Rands_Playboy_Interview.aspx |title = The Atlas Society : "The 'Lost' Parts of Ayn Rand's Playboy Interview" }}</ref>

Former Eisenhower cabinet member [[Ezra Taft Benson]], a leading Mormon, spoke in favor of the John Birch Society, but in January 1963 the Mormon church issued a statement distancing itself from the Society.<ref>Gregory A. Prince, "The Red Peril, the Candy Maker, and the Apostle: David O. Mckay's Confrontation with Communism," ''Dialogue: a Journal of Mormon Thought'' 2004 37(2): 37-94.</ref>

Antisemitic, [[racism|racist]], [[anti-Mormon]], anti-Masonic, and religious groups criticized the group's acceptance of Jews, non-whites, Masons, and Mormon. These opponents accused Welch of harboring [[feminist]], [[ecumenical]], and [[evolution]]ary ideas.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/NetLoss/NetLoss-Oliver.html |title = The John Birch Society&nbsp;<U+2013> Exposed! |accessdate = 2008-07-18 |first = John |last = Bryant}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.mormoninquiry.typepad.com/mormon_inquiry/2006/06/a_spectre_was_h.html |title = A Spectre Haunting Mormonism |accessdate = 2008-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.watch.pair.com/belmont.html |title = The Belmont Brotherhood |accessdate = 2008-07-18 |first = Nicholas J., Jr. |last = Bove}}</ref>

In 1964 Welch favored [[Barry Goldwater]] over [[Richard Nixon]] for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination, but the membership split, with two-thirds supporting Goldwater and one-third supporting Nixon. A number of Birch members and their allies were Goldwater supporters in 1964<ref>[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/goldwater--the-john-birch-society--and-me-11248 William F. Buckley, "Goldwater, the John Birch Society, and Me"]</ref> and some were delegates at the [[1964 Republican National Convention]]. The JBS played no known role in the fall election campaign.

In April 1966, a ''[[New York Times]]'' article on [[New Jersey]] and the society stated, in part, a concern for "the increasing tempo of radical right attacks on local government, libraries, school boards, parent-teacher associations, [[mental health]] programs, the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and, most recently, the ecumenical movement."<ref>Ronald Sullivan, "Foes of Rising Birch Society Organize in Jersey," ''New York Times,'' April 20, 1966, page 1</ref> It then characterized the society as, "by far the most successful and 'respectable' radical right organization in the country. It operates alone or in support of other extremist organizations whose major preoccupation, like that of the Birchers, is the internal Communist [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] in the United States."

===Eisenhower issue===
Welch wrote in a widely circulated statement, ''The Politician,'' "Could [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] really be simply a smart politician, entirely without principles and hungry for glory, who is only the tool of the Communists? The answer is yes." He went on. "With regard to ... Eisenhower, it is difficult to avoid raising the question of deliberate treason."<ref>Quoted at [http://www.jbs.org/jbs-news-feed/1375-glenn-beck-talks-with-jbs-president-john-f-mcmanus "Glenn Beck talks with JBS President John F. McManus" Aug. 15, 2006].</ref>

The controversial paragraph was removed before final publication of ''The Politician''.<ref>{{Cite book|last = Welch |first = Robert |title = The Politician |publisher = Western Islands |location = Boston |date = 1975 |isbn = 99908-64-98-5 |pages = cxxxviii<U+2013>cxxxix |quote = At this point in the original manuscript, there was one paragraph in which I expressed my own personal belief as to the most likely explanation of the events and actions with this document had tried to bring into focus. In a confidential letter, neither published nor offered for sale and restricted to friends who were expected to respect the confidence but offer me in exchange their own points of view, this seemed entirely permissible and proper. It does not seem so for an edition of the letter that is now to be published and given, probably, fairly wide distribution. So that paragraph, and two explanatory paragraphs, connected with it, have been omitted here. And the reader is left entirely free to draw his own conclusions. |nopp = true}}</ref>

The sensationalism of Welch's charges against Eisenhower prompted several conservatives and Republicans, most prominently Goldwater and the intellectuals of Buckley's circle, to renounce outright or quietly shun the group. Buckley, an early friend and admirer of Welch, regarded his accusations against Eisenhower as "paranoid and idiotic libels" and attempted unsuccessfully to purge Welch from the Birch Society.<ref>John B. Judis, ''William F. Buckley, Jr.: Patron Saint of the Conservatives'' (2001) pp 193-200</ref>

===1970s===
The society was at the center of an important [[freedom of expression|free-speech]] law case in the 1970s, after ''American Opinion'' accused a Chicago lawyer representing the family of a young man killed by a police officer of being part of a Communist conspiracy to merge all police agencies in the country into one large force. The resulting [[slander and libel|libel]] suit, ''[[Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.]]'', reached the [[United States Supreme Court]], which held that a state may allow a private figure such as Gertz to recover actual damages from a media defendant without proving malice, but that a public figure does have to prove actual malice, according to the standard laid out in [[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]], in order to recover presumed damages or punitive damages.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Haiman |first1 = Franklyn Saul | last2 = Tedford | first2 = Thomas L. | last3 = Herbeck | first3 = Dale |title = Freedom Of Speech In The United States |publisher = Strata Publishing |date = 2005 |isbn = 1-891136-10-0 |chapter = Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc |chapterurl = http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/comm/free_speech/gertz.html}}</ref> The court ordered a retrial in which Gertz prevailed.

Key society causes of the 1970s included opposition to both the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and to the establishment of diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China. The society claimed in 1973 that the regime of [[Mao Zedong]] had murdered 64 million Chinese as of that year and that it was the primary supplier of illicit [[heroin]] into the United States. This led to bumper stickers showing a pair of scissors cutting a hypodermic needle in half accompanied by the slogan "Cut The Red China Connection." According to the Voice of America, the society also was opposed to transferring control of the [[Panama Canal]] from American to Panamanian sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite news|first = Andrew |last = Guthrie |title = Is Panama Canal Falling Under Chinese Control? |url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/1999/991124-prc1.htm |work = Voice of America |date = 1999-11-24 |accessdate = 2008-07-25}}</ref>

The society was organized into local chapters during this period. Ernest Brosang, a New Jersey regional coordinator, claimed that it was virtually impossible for opponents of the society to penetrate its policy-making levels, thereby protecting it from "anti-American" takeover attempts. Its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation, warnings over the influence of the United Nations, and the release of petitions to impeach U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Earl Warren]]. To spread their message, members held showings of documentary films and operated initiatives such as "Let Freedom Ring", a nation-wide network of recorded telephone messages.

===After Welch===
[[File:USOutOfUN.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Political sign in white background advocating for removal of United States from the United Nations |A sign advocating America's withdrawal produced by the John Birch Society.]]
By the time of Welch's death in 1985, the society's membership and influence had dramatically declined, but the UN's role in the [[Gulf War]] and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush's]] call for a '[[New World Order (political)|New World Order]]' appeared to many society members to validate their claims about a [[New World Order (conspiracy)|"One World Government"]] conspiracy.

The society continues to press for an end to U.S. membership in the United Nations. As evidence of the effectiveness of JBS efforts, the society points to the [[Utah State Legislature]]'s failed resolution calling for U.S. withdrawal, as well as the actions of several other states where the Society's membership has been active. The society repeatedly opposed overseas war-making, although it is strongly supportive of the American military. It has issued calls to "Bring Our Troops Home" in every conflict since its founding, including [[Vietnam]]. The society also has a national speakers' committee called American Opinion Speakers Bureau (AOSB) and an anti-tax committee called TRIM (Tax Reform IMmediately).<ref>[http://www.rickross.com/reference/jbs/jbs2.html The Ross Institute].</ref>

The second head of the Society was Congressman [[Larry McDonald]] from Georgia, who was killed on September 1, 1983, when the Soviets shot down [[KAL 007]]. The only congressman killed by the Soviets during the Cold War, he was on the way to the 30th year commemoration of the U.S.-S. Korea Mutual Defense Treaty in Seoul.

===2009<U+2013>2010===
The Society has been active in supporting the auditing<ref>http://www.jbs.org/index.php/inflation-taxes-economy-blog/4569</ref> of and aims to eventually dismantle the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The JBS believes that the U.S. Constitution gave only Congress the ability to coin money, and did not intend for it to delegate this power to a banking monopoly, or to transform it into a [[Fiat money|fiat currency]] not backed by gold or silver.

The JBS was one of over one hundred exhibitors of the 2010 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]].<ref>[http://www.cpac.org/sponsors.html CPAC 2010 Cosponsors]. Retrieved January 30, 2010.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.jbs.org/press-room/5768-the-john-birch-society-announces-cpac-2010-cosponsorship |title = The John Birch Society Announces CPAC 2010 Cosponsorship |author = Bill Hahn, JBS Public Relations Manager |date = December 15, 2009 |accessdate = 2010-01-30 }}</ref>

==Members==
There are unofficial JBS chapters on many college campuses throughout the United States.

One survey in the early 1970s found the typical John Birch Society members were middle or [[upper-middle class]], Republican and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]. They were also fairly young and well educated: the majority of the sample was under 40 at time of recruitment and had completed at least three years of college. A later survey in the mid 1980s found the membership then was disproportionately from the [[Southwestern United States]], young, urban, male, and [[Catholic]]. They were consistently conservative on secular issues, antigovernment, and negative toward communism. Wilcox (1988) reports the evidence does not support liberal notions that irrationality, social strains, or status anxiety explained their beliefs.<ref>Stone (1974); Wilcox (1988).</ref>
