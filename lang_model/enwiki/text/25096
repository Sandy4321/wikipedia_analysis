'''Natarle Badgiruel''' (transliterated as '''Nataru Bajiruuru''' [<U+30CA><U+30BF><U+30EB><U+30FB><U+30D0><U+30B8><U+30EB><U+30FC><U+30EB>] in the original Japanese version) is a fictional character in the anime [[Mobile Suit Gundam SEED]]. She is voiced by [[Houko Kuwashima]] in the Japanese version and [[Sarah Johns]] in the English dub.

{{spoiler}}
The child of a military family, Natarle was a promising young Earth Alliance officer. Stationed on Orb's Heliopolis colony as part of a secret project to produce weapons capable of fighting [[ZAFT]]'s [[mobile suits]], Natarle is one of the few survivors when ZAFT's Le Creuset team raid the colony to seize the new weapons for themselves. She then became the executive officer of the ''Archangel'', who supervises the ship's Combat Information Center. She held reservations about allowing [[Kira Yamato]], a Coordinator, to remain on board the ship as a Gundam pilot but Captain [[Murrue Ramius]] disagreed, believing not all Coordinators were their enemy and that ultimately Kira was the only member of the crew capable of piloting the [[GAT-X105 Strike Gundam]] due to his genetic make up. Natarle is a stern martinet who operates strictly by the book. However, a series of incidents also show she is quite Machiavellian and willing to do almost anything to reach a certain end, even when it conflicts with Captain Ramius. 

The first incident occurs when Natarle uses [[Lacus Clyne]] in order to stave off ZAFT forces after they destroyed an entire Atlantic Federation fleet, killing Vice Foreign Minister George Allster in the process. The second incident occurs after the ''Archangel'' finally rendez-vouses with Admiral Lewis Halberton and his Eighth Fleet. When confronted with the dilemma of what to do with Kira, Natarle says that they cannot afford to let him leave and suggests taking his parents hostage. She wisely holds her tongue after Admiral Halberton retorts by asking her what good will a coerced soldier be, but this along with her earlier actions ultimately prompt much friction between her and Captain Ramius.

Nevertheless, Natarle is still a superb tactical analyst with keen judgement and a knack for swift decision-making, which made her a valuable asset to the ''Archangel''. In their last encounter face-to-face, Captain Ramius thanks Natarle for all her help and says she will make a fine captain someday.

Later, she was transferred shortly before the defection of the ''Archangel'' and became Captain of the ''Dominion'', the ''Archangel''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sister ship. Tragically, she was forced to battle her former crew at the Battle of Mendel and the Second Battle of Jachin Due. She is almost shot to death by [[Muruta Azrael]] when she opposes his extremist actions and killed when the ''Dominion'' is destroyed by the ''Archangel''.

Throughout most of the series, Natarle comes across as a rather cold individual blinded by her loyalty to the Earth Alliance. As was the case with ZAFT pilot [[Yzak Joule]], it was not until the latter stages of the war that she came to realise her misplaced trust and loyalty. Only after the Earth Alliance destroys Boaz with nuclear missiles does Natarle finally begin to question whether or not she is doing the right thing, and only when Azrael orders the ''Dominion'' to kill Captain Ramius and the rest of her former crewmates on board the ''Archangel'' does she defy his orders. 

==Trivia==
{{toomuchtrivia}}
*The choice of Kuwashima Houko as the seiyu for Natarle may be an insider joke: Houko and [[Mitsuishi Kotono]] (who voices Murrue Ramius) once worked together in the anime Noir, where they voiced Kirika Yumura and Mireille Bouquet respectively.
*Despite her reputation, Natarle is a kind person by nature. This is shown in 2 instances, while the Archangel was stranded in the desert. 
# During the rescue efforts after the attack in Tassil, not only did she let an injured (and crying) child wear her cap, she gave the boy a stick of rations, which the child wolfed down.
# When [[Mu La Flaga]] commented that [[Andrew Waltfeld]] was being lenient to the townsmen of Tassil by letting them live where he could have ordered them killed, Natarle joined the womenfolk in staring at the Hawk, although she most certainly knew that Mu was right.
*It has been implied in a series of one shot mangas to promote the Gundam SEED [[Game Boy Advance]] game that Natarle may have been jealous of Murrue's relationship with Mu. The comic, set during the ''Archangel's'' stay in Orb presents a story where a damaged shirt of Mu's goes missing from the ship's laundry room. Kira and his friends attempt to solve the mystery, ultimately realising it was Natarle who, after requesting sewing lessons from [[Miriallia Haw]], repaired the shirt for him.
*In the above-mentioned game itself, there is an option to get an "alternate ending" to the TV series. While in Orb, the Heliopolis kids can opt to help Arnold Neumann with his little unrequited crush (on Natarle), by setting up certain situations throughout the ship to force Natarle and Neumann to spend significant amounts of time within close proximity of each other (as well as dropping hints about Neumann's feelings for her). If successful, this side-event will culminate in Neumann working up the nerve to confess to Natarle, with the latter returning his affections (although not in an overly emotional way). This alternate outcome affects the final scenarios of the game, where in the point that Natarle orders Fllay Allster and the Dominion's crew to abandon ship following Muruta Azrael's violent outburst, she quickly follows them before sealing the bridge doors locking Azrael inside (instead of the canon where she locks them both in). Then in a transmission from her escape pod, Natarle gives Murrue advance warning regarding Azrael's increasing instability, beating the Blue Cosmos leader "to the draw" by having the Archangel fire its Lohengrin cannons at the Dominion first, effectively negating Mu La Flaga's sacrifice. (Fllay still dies as per the canon). Afterwards, a far more emotionally-wrought Natarle is welcomed back by Murrue. From there, Natarle would most likely have continued on the newly-formed relationship with her adoring subordinate Neumann. (This may well be the very reason she does not opt for the suicidal choice of the canon.)
*Natarle came from a long line of military officers and practically memorized the full rules for military conduct.
