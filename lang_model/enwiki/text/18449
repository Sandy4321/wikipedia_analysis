In his review for [[AllMusic]], Charlie Wilmoth states "Despite their involvement with the downtown New York avant-jazz crowd, multi-reedist [[Daniel Carter (musician)|Daniel Carter]], trumpeter [[Roy Campbell, Jr.|Roy Campbell]], and bassist [[William Parker (musician)|William Parker]] probably play in a pensive, straightforward manner just as often as they play free."<ref name="Allmusic">{{allmusic|last=Wilmoth|first=Charlie|class=album|id=mw0000619079|title=''Other Dimensions In Music'': Review|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref>

In a retrospective view, Phil Freeman states on Burning Ambulance that the album "is somewhat stiff and lacks the fluidity of their later work, but it<U+2019>s an extremely lyrical, melodic and groove-based effort that may surprise listeners coming in expecting blare."<ref name="Burning Ambulance review">[http://burningambulance.com/2011/04/25/other-dimensions-in-music-featuring-fay-victor/ ''Other Dimensions In Music featuring Fay Victor'' review] at Burning Ambulance</ref>
