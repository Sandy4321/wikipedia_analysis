The '''Viking''' (since the 1950s better known under her Swedish name as '''Barken Viking''' "The Barque Viking"), a four-masted steel [[barque]], was built in 1906 by Burmeister & Wain in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. She was originally built to be used as a sail training ship for sailors for the rapidly growing Danish merchant fleet. At that time, seaworthiness and cargo capacity were given top priority. One day in July of 1909 captain Niels Clausen recorded in the ship's log a speed record, 15.5&nbsp;knots (28.7&nbsp;km/h) while carrying a full cargo of [[wheat]] from [[Australia]] making a 24-hour-run of 372 seamiles. In 1929 she joined the Erikson-fleet of tall ships, but was about to be scrapped in the late 1940s when she was eventually saved by the Swedish government in 1950. She is reported to be the biggest sailing ship ever built in Scandinavia. Because of the low bridges that separate the tall ship from the open sea it's hard to believe she will sail the seas ever again.

There are only ten four-masted barques and one four-masted full-rigged ship (the ''Falls of Clyde'') in existence and only five of these still sail (''[[Sedov]]'', ''[[Kruzenshtern (ship)|Kruzenshtern]]'', ''Sea Cloud I'', ''Nippon Maru II'', ''Kaiwo Maru II''). A few more are still afloat and berthed in various harbours (''Peking'' ([[New York City]]), ''Moshulu'' ([[Philadelphia]]), ''Passat'' ([[L<U+00FC>beck]], Germany), ''Pommern'' ([[Mariehamn]], Finland), ''Viking'')

She came permanently to [[Gothenburg]]/[[G<U+00F6>teborg]], [[Sweden]] in 1950 as a home for different shipping institutions and later as a school of seamanship. Today she is moored in the G<U+00F6>teborg guest harbour as hotel "Barken Viking". The owner is [[Liseberg]] amusement park.

Facts:
*[[o/a|Length overall]] with the jib-boom - 118 m
*Length without the jib-boom (hull length) - 106 m <!-- the over-all length of 118 exceeds the hull length of 106 metres by 12 metres due to the long jib-boom-->
*Length on deck - 97 m
*[[p/p|Length p/p]] -  87 m
*Beam (Width) - 13.9 m
*Draught - 7.33 m
*Depth of hold - 8.1 m
*Ballast - 1,400 tonnes (1,370 tons) <!-- 14,000 tonnes, the previous value written here, can't be correct, because the ship's weight without cargo is around 1,700 metric tonnes, with a cargo of 4,100 tonnes and 500 tons water ballast around 6,300 tonnes (the bigger "Moshulu" had ~ 7.000 tons displacement). The only sailing ship having displaced around 14,000 tonnes was the American seven-masted steel schooner "Thomas W. Lawson" when under full cargo of nearly 11,000 tonnes-->
*Displacement - ~6,300 tonnes
*Cargo capacity - 4,100 tonnes (4,035 tons)
*Cargo hold - 6,300 m<U+00B3> (2,959 [[GRT]] / 2,665 NRT)
*Highest mast - 55.5 m above deck
*Sail area - 3,690 m<U+00B2>
*Anchor weight - 3 tonnes each
*[[Launch]] - [[1 December]] 1906
*[[Maiden voyage]] - [[19 July]] 1907 via [[Hamburg]] (coal) to [[Callao]] and back to Hamburg (guano)
