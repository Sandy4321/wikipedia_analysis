However, perceptions of the Boxers, among 20th century Chinese intellectuals and modern scholars, remains nuanced, complex, and contentious. The failures of the Boxer Rebellion initially humiliated educated Chinese nationalists, who disdained them for their superstition and aggression.

In 1900, Boxer fighters besieged the foreign embassies in Beijing. They were lightly armed, [[Chinese spirit possession|claiming supernatural invulnerability towards blows]] of cannon, rifle gunshots, and knife attacks. In response, the initially hesitant [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], urged by the conservatives of the Imperial Court, supported the Boxers and declared war on [[Eight-Nation Alliance|foreign powers]]. Diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers and Chinese Christians retreated to the [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]] where they remained under siege for 55 days until the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] brought 20,000 armed troops to defeat the besieging Imperial Army. During the siege, pro foreign Imperial army units under [[Prince Qing]] fought against the anti foreign Imperial army units besieging the foreigners, in addition, the supreme commander of the Chinese forces, [[Ronglu]], was pro foreign himself and acted in a way that prevented Chinese success.  The [[Boxer Protocol]] of 7 September 1901 ended the uprising and provided for severe punishments, including an indemnity of 67-million [[pound sterling|pounds]]<ref>Spence, ''In Search of Modern China'', pp. 230-235; Keith Schoppa, ''Revolution and Its Past'', pp. 118-123.</ref> (450 million [[tael]]s of silver, to be paid as indemnity over a course of 39 years) to the eight nations involved.

==Origins of the Boxers==
[[File:BoxersDrawingByKoekkoek1900.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Boxers, by [[Johannes Hermanus Barend Koekkoek|Johannes Koekkoek]] circa 1900.]]
The Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, known by foreigners as the ''Boxers'', or "I-Ho Magic Boxing", was a secret society founded in the northern coastal province of [[Shandong]].<ref>G. William Skinner divided China into eight "macroregions": "North China [located along the coast], Northwest China [inland, west of North China], the Lower, Middle and Upper Yangzi [all three ranging, in succession, from the coast to the western border], the Southeast Coast, Lingnan (centered on Canton) and the Southwestern region around Yunnan and Guizhou" (Esherick 1987, 3-4)</ref> Westerners came to call well-trained, athletic young men "Boxers" due to the martial arts and [[calisthenics]] they practiced. The Boxers' primary feature is [[Chinese Spirit possession|spirit possession]], which involved whirling and twirling of swords, violent prostrations, and chanting incantations to Taoist and Buddhist spirits. When the spirit possession had achieved, the boxers would allegedly obtain invulnerability against firing guns and cannons.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Larry Clinton|title=William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: heroism, hubris and the " Ideal Missionary"|url=http://books.google.com/?id=5K9BN96p1hcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Boxer+Rebellion#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher= McFarland & Company|isbn=ISBN-13: 9780786440085|date=2009-01}}</ref>

The Boxers believed that they could, through training, diet, martial arts and prayer, perform extraordinary feats, such as flight, and could become immune to swords and bullets. Further, they popularly claimed that millions of ''spirit soldiers'' would descend from the heavens and assist them in purifying China of foreign influences. The Boxers consisted of local farmers/peasants and other workers made desperate by disastrous floods and widespread opium addiction, and found blame in Christian missionaries, Chinese Christians, and the Europeans colonizing their country.  Missionaries were protected under the policy of [[extraterritoriality]]. Aggression toward missionaries and Christians gained the attention of foreign (mainly European) governments.<ref>Spence (1999) pp. 231-232.</ref>

Several secret societies in Shandong predated the Boxers. In 1895, the Manchu Yuxian, a magistrate in the province, acquired the help of the Big Swords Society in fighting against Bandits. The Big Swords practiced heterodox practices, however, they were not bandits and were not seen as bandits by Chinese authorities. They were so efficient in defeating banditry that a flood of cases overwhelmed the magistrates, so the Big Swords just executed Bandits to save them trouble.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=ikbkTIj_DYGClAeln6SYDQ&ct=result&id=J07_tPJu9M8C&dq=in+November+1897+a+particularly+aggressive+German+priest+named+George+Stenz+so+outraged+villagers+in+the&q=magistrate+yu+hsien+big+swords+collaring|title=Dragon lady: the life and legend of the last empress of China|author=Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave|year=1992|publisher=Knopf|location=|page=294|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> The Big Swords relentlessly crushed the bandits, but the bandits converted to Catholic Christianity, because it made them legally immune to prosecution and under the protection of the foreigners.

After the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] failed, the conservative [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] seized power and put the reformist [[Guangxu Emperor]] into house arrest. The European powers were sympathetic to the imprisoned emperor, and opposed Cixi's plan to replace the Guangxu emperor.  Empress Dowager Cixi decided to use Boxers to expel foreign influences from China; meanwhile, the Boxers would be weakened by foreign forces.

===Causes of the Boxer Rebellion ===
[[File:3090 donations lg.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese donate silver ingots to [[Zeng Guoquan]] to assist him in destroying the Russian Army]]

In 1900, the great powers had been chipping away at Chinese sovereignty for sixty years. They had forced China to import opium, causing widespread addiction, defeated China in several wars, asserted a right to promote Christianity, and imposed [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] under which foreigners and foreign companies in China were accorded special privileges and immunities from Chinese law. Thus, by 1900, the Qing dynasty that had ruled China for more than two centuries was crumbling and Chinese culture was under assault by powerful alien religious and secular culture.<ref name="Thompson, Larry Clinton 2009">Thompson, Larry Clinton. ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary''. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2009, 7-8</ref>

Several factors contributed to the unrest among Chinese that led to the growth and spread of the Boxer movement.  First, a drought, followed by floods, in Shandong province in 1897-1898 forced farmers to flee to cities to seek food. As one observer said, "I am convinced that a few days' heavy rainfall to terminate the long-continued drought...would do more to restore tranquility than any measures which either the Chinese government or foreign governments can take."<ref>Thompson, 9</ref>

By 1900, the western powers had grabbed land and asserted unequal treaties and extraterritorial rights for their citizens in China, causing resentment among the Chinese.<ref name="Thompson, Larry Clinton 2009"/> France, Japan, Russia, and Germany carved out spheres of influence, so that by 1900 it appeared that China would likely be dismembered, with foreign powers each ruling a part of the country. The British and Americans wished China to remain intact, though, while retaining their privileges and treaty ports. The British dominated trade with China, including the important opium trade.<ref>Thompson, 11-12</ref>

German priest George Stenz's antagonistic behavior antagonized Chinese inhabitants of villages in 1897.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J07_tPJu9M8C&q=in+November+1897+a+particularly+aggressive+German+priest+named+George+Stenz+so+outraged+villagers+in+the&dq=in+November+1897+a+particularly+aggressive+German+priest+named+George+Stenz+so+outraged+villagers+in+the&hl=en&ei=ikbkTIj_DYGClAeln6SYDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA|title=Dragon lady: the life and legend of the last empress of China|author=Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave|year=1993|publisher=Vintage Books|location=|page=294|isbn=0679733698|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> In response, Chinese people stormed into his residence, and killed two priests while looking for George, who was not present.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&pg=PA363&dq=george+stenz&hl=en&ei=fmLkTIq1DYq4sAPrldlm&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=george%20stenz%20hacked%20nies%20and%20henle&f=false|title=The origins of the Boxer Uprising|author=Joseph Esherick|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkely California|isbn=0520064593|page=123|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> 

A major cause of Chinese discontent was the Christian missionaries, [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic, who came to China in ever increasing numbers. The exemption of missionaries from many laws alienated local Chinese. In 1899, with the help of the French Minister in Beijing, the missionaries obtained an edict granting official rank to each order in the Roman Catholic hierarchy. Local priests, by means of this official status, were able to support their people in legal disputes or family feuds and go over the heads of local officials. After the German government took over territory in Shandong, many Chinese feared that the missionaries, and by extension all Christians, were part of an imperialist attempt to "carve the melon," that is, to divide China and colonize the pieces separately.<ref>"Imperialism, for Christ's Sake," Ch. 3 , Esherick, ''The Origins of the Boxer Uprising'', pp. 68-95.</ref>  A Chinese official expressed the brief against the foreigners succinctly, "Take away your missionaries and your opium and you will be welcome."<ref>Thompson, 12</ref>

A Chinese Buddhist temple in Lilienyuan village was converted into a Catholic church by missionaries, which caused widespread anger among the Chinese population.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Md801mHEeOkC&pg=PA121&dq=chinese+temple+catholic+boxers#v=onepage&q=chinese%20temple%20catholic%20boxers&f=false|title=Modern Chinese warfare, 1795-1989|author=Bruce A.

The German Baron [[Clemens von Ketteler]] brutally attacked a Chinese civilian without provocation, and also beat a boy.

[[File:Boxer1900.jpg|upright|thumb|A Boxer during the revolt.]]
The growth of the Boxer movement coincided with the [[Hundred Days Reform]] (11 June<U+2013>21 September 1898). Progressive Chinese officials<U+2014>with support from Protestant missionaries<U+2014>persuaded the Guangxu Emperor to institute reforms, which alienated many conservative officials by their sweeping nature, and which led the Empress Dowager to intervene and reverse the reforms. The failure of the reform movement disillusioned many educated Chinese, contributing to the weakness of the Qing government.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/china/18.htm Countrydstudies.us]</ref><ref>[http://www.thecorner.org/hist/china/hdreform.htm Thecorner.org]</ref>

The first conflicts of the Boxer Rebellion were in Shandong province.  Suppressed there<U+2014>and the farmers being pacified by timely rains<U+2014>the  shadowy Boxer movement spread northward in early 1900. By late  May, the thousands of Western and Japanese businessmen, soldiers, and missionaries in Beijing and Tianjin and throughout northern China perceived it as a serious threat to foreign and Christian lives, properties, and privileges.<ref>Thompson, 40-53</ref>

===Commitment of Imperial Army===
[[File:Chinese soldiers 1899 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese forces in 1899-1901.<br>''Left'': two infantrymen of the [[New Army|New Imperial Army]]. ''Front'': drum major of the regular army. Seated on the trunk: field artilleryman. ''Right'': Boxers.]]
Now with a majority of conservatives in the Imperial Court the Empress Dowager changed her long policy of suppressing Boxers; she issued edicts in defense of the Boxers, which drew heated complaints from foreign diplomats in January 1900. In June 1900 the Boxers, now joined by elements of the Imperial army, attacked foreign compounds in the cities of Tianjin and Beijing. The legations of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Russia and Japan were all located on the [[Beijing Legation Quarter]] close to the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing. The legations were hurriedly linked into a fortified compound that became a refuge for foreign citizens in Beijing. The Spanish and Belgian legations were a few streets away and their staffs were able to arrive safely at the compound. The German legation on the other side of the city was stormed before the staff could escape. When the envoy for the German Empire, [[Klemens von Ketteler|Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler]], was murdered on 20 June by a Manchurian man,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} the foreign powers demanded redress. On 21 June Empress Dowager Cixi declared war against all Western powers; regional governors, including [[Li Hongzhang]] and [[Zhang Zhidong]], quietly refused to cooperate. Shanghai's Chinese elite supported the provincial governors of southeastern China in resisting the Imperial declaration of war.<ref>"The Gathering Storm," Ch 7, "Prairie Fire," Ch 10 Esherick, pp. 167-205, 271-313.</ref> Later many peasants took up arms and joined the Boxers' cause, but were also defeated.

During the war, Cixi displayed concern about China's situation and foreign aggression, saying of the Boxers, "Perhaps their magic is not to be relied upon; but can we not rely on the hearts and minds of the people? Today China is extremely weak. We have only the people's hearts and minds to depend upon. If we cast them aside and lose the people's hearts, what can we use to sustain the country?" The Chinese people were almost unanimous in their support for the Boxers, due to the Western Allied invasion.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jVESdBSMasMC&pg=PA289&dq=Perhaps+their+magic+is+not+to+be+relied+upon:+but+can+we+not+rely+on+the+hearts+and+minds+of+the+people%3F+Today+China+is+extremely+weak.+We+have+only+the+people's+hearts+and+minds+to+depend+upon.+If+we+cast+them+aside+and+lose+the+people's+hearts,+what+can+we#v=onepage&q=Perhaps%20their%20magic%20is%20not%20to%20be%20relied%20upon%3A%20but%20can%20we%20not%20rely%20on%20the%20hearts%20and%20minds%20of%20the%20people%3F%20Today%20China%20is%20extremely%20weak.%20We%20have%20only%20the%20people's%20hearts%20and%20minds%20to%20depend%20upon.%20If%20we%20cast%20them%20aside%20and%20lose%20the%20people's%20hearts%2C%20what%20can%20we&f=false|title=The origins of the Boxer Uprising|author=Joseph Esherick|year=1988|publisher=University of California Press|location=|page=289|isbn=0520064593|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

It was reported that the Chinese artillery was superior to the European artillery, since the Europeans did not bother to bring along much for the campaign, thinking they could easily sweep through Chinese resistance. The Europeans could not locate the Chinese artillery, which was raining shells upon their positions. The Chinese villages were nests for Imperial Chinese army and Boxer resistance, and Chinese snipers poured fire out of loopholes, killing any foreigner who stepped out onto the streets. The snipers proved impossible to remove.<ref name="smith1901"/>

Chinese artillery accuracy was excellent, some tearing straight through the Allied military barracks. The London ''Times'' noted that "10,000 European troops were held in check by 15,000 Chinese braves". The artillery caused casualties to continually build up. A group of allied soldiers narrowly escaped after Chinese artillery shells almost destroyed their train.<ref name="smith1901"/> The French and Japanese suffered heavily, and the Russians and British lost some men on the retreat as well.

A large part of western victories was not due to their own military prowess, rather, it was due to rivalries between the Boxers and the Chinese Imperial army, and conflicting orders given to Chinese Generals by the court. The court first ordered General Nie to fight the Boxers, then fight against the Western Allies and the Boxers at the same time,also it ordered General Nie not to use all the force at his disposal to crush the Allied troops, this resulted in the Chinese forces actually deliberately letting the Allied forces escape, after the Chinese mauled them at the [[Battle of Langfang]].<ref name="Jane E.

====Imperial Army Manchu Bannermen====
Several Manchu princes such as [[Prince Ching]] declined to join the boxers and the rest of the imperial army to attack the legations, and even ordered their own Manchu Bannermen to attack the Boxers and the Muslim Kansu braves.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=uqcoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA112&dq=manchu+princes+kansu+braves+boxers&q=manchu%20princes%20kansu%20braves%20boxers|title=Appletons' annual cyclop<U+00E6>dia and register of important events of the year ..., Volume 5|author=|year=1901|publisher=D.

Other Manchu banners, especially the Three modernized divisions, joined the Kansu Braves and Boxers in attacking the foreigners. They were totally smashed at the end of the war and left only the Muslim Kansu Braves to guard to Imperial court. Among the Manchu dead was the father of the writer [[Lao She]].<ref name="Edward J.

Prince Duan commanded his own Manchu Bannermen division, Marksmen for the Tiger Hunt, also known as the "Tiger Spirit Division" (<U+864E><U+795E><U+8425>). It had 10,000 troops in it.

The campaign in Manchuria was conducted by both the regular Imperial army, including Manchu Bannermen and Imperial Chinese troops, and the Boxers.

The Chinese treated Russian civilians leniently and allowed them to escape to Russia, even notifying them since a state of war existed, that they should leave the war zone, by contrast, Russian Cossacks brutally killed civilians who tried to flee in the Chinese villages, westerners noted that the Chinese followed "civilized warfare" while the Russians massacred and butchered. The Chinese summoned all available men to fight, and the Chinese forces and garrisons gathered artillery and bombarded Russian troops and towns across the Amur. Despite the Cossacks repulsing Chinese army crossings into Russia, the Chinese army troops increased the amount of artillery and kept up the bombardment. In revenge for the attacks on Chinese villages, Boxer troops burned Russian towns and almost annihilated a Russian force at Tielen.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DEwoAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA105&dq=russian+boxer+invaded+manchuria#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events|author=|year=1901|publisher=D.

The Russians invaded Manchuria during the rebellion, which was defended by Manchu bannermen. The bannermen were annihilated as they fought to the death against the Russians, each falling one at a time against a five pronged Russian invasion. The Russians killed many of the Manchus, thousands of them fled south. The Russian Cossacks looted their villages and property and then burnt them to ashes.<ref name="Edward J. M.

====Boxers====
The Boxers themselves used modern weaponry like Krupp artillery and rifles, their dislike of Westerners only extended to everything which was not related to weaponry.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC&q=all+things+modern#v=snippet&q=all%20things%20western%20modern&f=false|title=Some did it for civilisation, some did it for their country: a revised view of the boxer war|author=Jane E.

====Lack of Coordination and Sabotage====
The [[Manchu]] General [[Ronglu]] deliberately sabotaged the performance of the Imperial army. When Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops were eager to and could have destroy the foreigners in the legations, Ronglu stopped them from doing so.<ref name="Paul A. Cohen 1997 54"/> The Manchu General [[Zaiyi, Prince Duan]], was xenophobic and was friends with [[Dong Fuxiang]]. Zaiyi wanted artillery for Dong Fuxiang's troops to destroy the legations. Ronglu blocked the transfer of artillery to Zaiyi and Dong, preventing them from destroying the legations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=GiqiIYdocKMC&pg=PA216&dq=ronglu+legations#v=onepage&q=ronglu%20legations&f=false|title=Empress dowager Cixi: China's last dynasty and the long reign of a formidable concubine : legends and lives during the declining days of the Qing Dynasty|author=X.

Ronglu and Prince Qing even sent food to the legations, and used their Manchu Bannermen to attack the Muslim Kansu Braves of Dong Fuxiang and the Boxers who were besieging the foreigners. They even issued edicts ordering the foreigners to be protected, but the Kansu warriors ignored it, and fought against Bannermen who tried to force them away from the legations.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=DEwoAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA112&dq=kansu+braves+baron+von#v=onepage&q=kansu%20braves%20baron%20von&f=false|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events|author=|year=1901|publisher=D.

It was Ronglu and other "moderates", who withdrew the Kansu Muslim warriors from Beijing, in order to let the foreigners march right in. The Muslim troops were feared intensely by the foreigners.<ref name="seagrave1993"/>

Ronglu also deliberately hid an Imperial Decree from General Nie Shicheng. The Decree ordered him to stop fighting the Boxers due to the foreign invasion, and also because the population was suffering from the campaign against the Boxers. Due to Ronglu's treachery, General Nie continued to fight against the Boxers and killed many of them, while the foreign invaders were making their way into China. Ronglu also ordered Nie to protect foreigners and save the railway from the Boxers.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lAxresT12ogC&pg=PA235&dq=ronglu+supplies+legations#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|location=|page=235|isbn=0700715630|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

During the war, due to the fact that parts of the Railway were saved under Ronglu's orders, the foreign invasion army was able to transport itself into China quickly.

Due to Ronglu's sabotage, General Nie was forced to fight the Boxers as the foreign army advanced into China. The fierce Boxer insurgency led General Nie to commit thousands of troops against them, instead of against the foreigners. Nie was already outnumbered by the Allies by 4,000 men. General Nie was blamed for attacking the Boxers, as Ronglu intended to sabotage Nie and let him take all the blame. At the [[Battle of Tiensten]], General Nie decided to take his own life by walking into the range of Allied guns.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wWvl9O4Gn1UC&q=li+was+well+aware+of+marked+value+of+weaponry#v=onepage&q=exposed%20himself%20to%20fire%20died&f=false|title=Some did it for civilisation, some did it for their country: a revised view of the boxer war|author=Jane E.

A large part of western victories was not due to their own military prowess, rather, it was due to rivalries between the Boxers and the Chinese Imperial army, and conflicting orders given to Chinese Generals by the court. The court first ordered General Nie to fight the Boxers, then with them, then fight against the Western Allies and the Boxers at the same time, and it also ordered General Nie '''not''' to use all the force at his disposal to crush the Allied troops, which resulted in the Chinese forces actually deliberately letting the Allied forces escape, after the Chinese mauled them at the [[Battle of Langfang]]. The Boxers reportedly were able to destroy the Allied force completely, but the Chinese Military ordered them to stand down.<ref name="Jane E. Elliott 2002 529"/>

===Massacre of missionaries and Chinese Christians===
[[Image:Chinese Martirs.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chinese Martyrs|Holy Chinese Martyrs]]]]
The [[Taiyuan Massacre]] was the mass killing of foreign Christian missionaries and of local church members, including children, from July 1900. Two hundred and twenty two Chinese Eastern Orthodox Christians were also killed, along with 182 Protestant missionaries and 500 Chinese Protestants known as the [[China Martyrs of 1900]]. Also, 48 Catholic missionaries and 18,000 Chinese Catholics were killed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
The Muslim Kansu braves under General Dong Fuxiang joined the Boxers in targeting Chinese Christians, going house to house to check the people's religious beliefs and generally looting.<ref name="Sterling Making of America Project 1914 80"/>

The ''Missionary Herald'' normally published letters and telegrams sent by priests and their families in Manchu Qing dynasty, in Shanxi province, Taiyuan city. In December 1900, after incrementally more ominous monthly reports, the ''Missionary Herald'' broke five-month-old news to its readers: "the entire mission staff in the Province of Shanxi has perished". At the end of June 1900 priests and their families had been lured out of hiding and cast into prison, then executed by the Manchu officials. The Taiyuan missionaries fled into a co-worker's house because Boxers were burning churches and houses, killing Christians and foreigners. Three days later the governor sent four deputies with soldiers, "promising to escort them in safety to the coast". Brought instead to a house near the governor<U+2019>s residence, they were then "taken to the open space in front of the Governor<U+2019>s residence, and stripped to the waist, as usual with those beheaded".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bmsworldmission.org/standard.aspx?id=9436|title=The Boxer Rebellion|publisher=bms world mission|accessdate=14 Oct. 2008}}</ref>

===Boxer siege of Beijing===
[[File:Western Legations Peking 1900 Clowes Vol VII.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|<center>Locations of foreign diplomatic legations and front lines in Beijing during the siege.</center>]]
The compound in Beijing remained under siege from Boxer forces from 20 June - 14 August. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge in the Legation Quarter.<ref>Thompson, 84-85</ref>  (See [[Siege of the Legations, Beijing 1900]]) Under the command of the British minister to China, [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], the legation staff and security personnel defended the compound with small arms, three machine guns, and one old muzzle-loaded cannon; it was nicknamed the ''International Gun'' because the barrel was British, the carriage was Italian, the shells were Russian and the crew was American.

During the defence of the legations, a small Japanese force of one officer and 24 sailors commanded by [[Shiba Gor<U+014D>|Colonel Shiba]], distinguished itself in several ways. Of particular note was that it had the almost unique distinction of suffering greater than 100 percent casualties. This was possible because a great many of the Japanese troops were wounded, entered into the casualty lists, then returned to the line of battle only to be wounded once more and again entered in the casualty lists.<ref>Fleming, 1959. pp. 143-144.</ref>

Also under siege in Peking was the North Cathedral, the Beitang, of the Catholic Church.  The Beitang was defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 Catholic Priests and nuns, and about 3,200 Chinese Catholics.  The defenders suffered heavy casualties especially from lack of food and Chinese mines exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound.<ref>Thompson, 85, 170-171</ref>

Foreign media described the fighting going on in Beijing, as well as the alleged torture and murder of captured foreigners. While it is true that thousands of Chinese Christians were massacred in north China, many horrible stories that appeared in world newspapers were based on the actual murder of men, women and children within the foreign legation. Nonetheless a wave of anti-Chinese{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} sentiment arose in Europe, the United States and Japan.<ref>Elliott (1996)</ref> The poorly armed Boxer rebels were unable to break into the compound, which was relieved by an international army of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in August.

On July 1, the Chinese artillery bombardment had finally exhausted the Allies patience, and they determined to put it to a halt. The Italians and British sought to sortie and destroyed the Chinese artillery. When the Italian attack commenced, they ran toward the Chinese lines, but as soon as the Chinese fire hit them, they fled in terror and retreated, several Italians were killed and wounded, fleeing like mad to escape. Some of their clothes were dripping in blood. The Italian Lieutenant was severely wounded and the dead bodies of Italians went missing.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0Yu9Tf5leGgC&pg=PA117&dq=chinese+artillery+peking#v=snippet&q=italian%20charge%20attack%20delivered&f=false|title=Indiscreet Letters from Peking: Being the Notes of an Eye-witness|author=Bertram L.

Accurate Chinese snipers and artillery constantly pounded the legations, forcing defenders to abandon multiple positions. The Chinese forces occupied Su Wang Fu and the French Legation, being nearly successful in defeating American and Russians in the city wall. However, the Dowager Empress Cixi declared a truce on June 25th, because she had an altercation with the anti foreign [[Prince Duan]], who wanted all the foreigners exterminated. But when news came of the Chinese victory over Seymour's forces in the [[First intervention, Seymour Expedition, China 1900]], fighting resumed. It was Chinese collaboraters in the legations who led the foreigners to a cannon after digging, which they managed to deploy to defend themselves.  In July 13th, the French legation was demolish by Chinese mining explisives. However, the pro foreign factions and anti foreign factions were squabbling against each other at the Chinese court. The pro foreigner Qing Princes even offered the foriengers safety in the Zongli Yamen. They even decaled a cease fire from July 14- August 4, Dowager Empress Cixi even sent food and supplies to the foreigners.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=48g116X9IIwC&pg=PA50&dq=prince+tuan+replaced+prince+qing&hl=en&ei=HH7fTIzXAcOclgeYzJ24Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The War of 1898, and U.S. interventions, 1898-1934: an encyclopedia|author=Benjamin R.

During the siege, Westerners maintained control over diminishing food resources, prioritising their own needs and denying aid to the Chinese Christians who had sought shelter with them. As [[Max Boot]] describes it, "the starving Chinese converts were reduced to eating tree bark and leaves, while the Europeans still enjoyed free-flowing [[champagne]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0lIg-lGwqBoC&pg=PA79&dq=En+Hai+ketteler#v=onepage&q=starving%20chinese%20converts%20tree%20bark%20leaves%20suffer%20most&f=false|title=The savage wars of peace: small wars and the rise of American power|author=Max Boot|year=2003|publisher=Basic Books|location=|page=80|isbn=046500721X|pages=|accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>

===Torching of Chinese dwellings===
On 23 June 1900 the Boxer rebels started setting fire to an area south of the British Legation, using it as a "frightening tactic" to attack the defenders. And [[Hanlin Yuan]], a complex of courtyards and buildings that housed "the quintessence of Chinese scholarship ... the oldest and richest library in the world", ([[Yongle Dadian]]) was just nearby.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-davd.htm|title=Destruction Of Chinese Books In The Peking Siege Of 1900. Donald G. Davis, Jr. University of Texas at Austin, USA Cheng Huanwen Zhongshan University, PRC |publisher=International Federation of Library Association|accessdate=26 Oct. 2008}}</ref>
Sir Claude MacDonald, the commander-in-chief, had become worried that the Boxer rebels might try to burn the [[Hanlin Yuan]], the "buildings at some point being only an arm's length from the British building walls."

On 24 June 1900, when the winds shifted, the unanticipated happened: Hanlin Yuan's group of buildings had caught fire, and the fire was beginning to spread further.
Eyewitness' accounts:

{{quote|The old buildings burned like tinder with a roar which drowned the steady rattle of musketry as Tung Fu-shiang's Moslems fired wildly through the smoke from upper windows...Some of the incendiaries were shot down, but the buildings were an inferno and the old trees standing round them blazed like torches...An attempt was made to save the famous Yang Lo Ta Tien [now spelled [[Yongle Dadian]]], but heaps of volumes had been destroyed, so the attempt was given up.| eyewitness, Lancelot Giles, son of Herbert A. Giles.}}

The Manchu authority blamed the British for setting the fire as a defensive measure, whereas the British pointed to the direction of the wind, and claimed that it was either the Boxer rebels or the ordinary Manchu soldiers who "set fire to the Hanlin, working systematically from one courtyard to the next."<ref>

==Arrival of reinforcements==
{{Boxer Rebellion}}
[[Image:BoxerTroops.jpg|thumb|left|The Eight-Nation Alliance with their naval flags. Japanese print, 1900]]

Foreign navies started building up their presence along the northern China coast from the end of April 1900. On 31 May, before the sieges had started and upon the request of foreign embassies in Beijing, an international force of 435 navy troops from eight countries were dispatched by train from [[Taku Forts|Takou]] to the capital (75 French, 75 Russian, 75 British, 60 U.S., 50 German, 40 Italian, 30 Japanese, 30 Austrian); these troops joined the legations and were able to contribute to their defense. The rebellion was ultimately quashed by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]], [[Imperial Japan|Japan]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the United States.

===First intervention===
{{main|Seymour Expedition}}
[[Image:BoxerJapaneseMarines.jpg|thumb||Japanese marines who served under the British commander [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Seymour]].]]

As the situation worsened a second international force of 2,000 Marines under the command of the British Vice-Admiral [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Edward Seymour]], the largest contingent being British, was dispatched from [[Takou]] to Beijing on 10 June. The troops were transported by train from Takou to Tianjin with the agreement of the Chinese government, but the railway between Tianjin and Beijing had been severed. Seymour resolved to move forward and repair the rail or such as the train, or progress on foot as necessary, keeping in mind that the distance between Tianjin and Beijing was only 120&nbsp;km. However, Seymour left Tiensten, and started toward Peking, which angered the Chinese Imperial court. As a result, the Pro Boxer Manchu Prince Tuan became leader of the Tsungli Yamen (foreign office), replacing Prince Ching, orders were given to Imperial army to attack the foreign forces. Chinese General Nie let Seymour's army slip pass in trains, because Ronglu deliberately issued contradicting orders, which left Nie confused.<ref>{{cite  web|url=www.jhuapl.edu/ourwork/nsa/papers/China%20ReliefSm.pdf|title=The China Relief Expedition Joint Coalition Warfare in China Summer 1900|last=Leonhard|first=Robert R.|date=|page=12|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>

After Tianjin the convoy was surrounded, the railway behind and in front of them was destroyed, and they were attacked from all parts by Chinese irregulars and even Chinese governmental troops. News arrived on 18 June regarding attacks on foreign legations. Seymour decided to continue advancing, this time along the Pei-Ho river, toward [[Tong-Tcheou]], 25&nbsp;km from Beijing. By the 19th, they had to abandon their efforts due to progressively stiffening resistance and started to retreat southward along the river with over 200 wounded. Commandeering four civilian Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junk]]s along the river, they loaded all their wounded and remaining supplies onto them and pulled them along with ropes from the riverbanks. By this point they were very low on food, ammunition and medical supplies. Luckily, they then happened upon [[The Great Hsi-Ku Arsenal]], a hidden Qing munitions cache that the Western Powers had no knowledge of until then. They immediately captured and occupied it, discovering not only German Krupp-made field guns, but rifles with millions of rounds in ammunition, along with millions of pounds of rice and ample medical supplies.

[[Image:SeymourTianjin.jpg|thumb|left|Admiral Seymour returning to Tianjin with his wounded men, on 26 June.]]
There they dug in and awaited rescue. A Chinese servant was able to infiltrate through the Boxer and Qing lines, informing the Eight Powers of their predicament. Surrounded and attacked nearly around the clock by Qing troops and Boxers, they were at the point of being overrun. On 25 June a regiment composed of 1800 men, (900 Russian troops from [[L<U+00FC>shunkou|Port-Arthur]], 500 British seamen, with an ad hoc mix of other assorted western troops) finally arrived. Spiking the mounted field guns and setting fire to any munitions that they could not take (an estimated <U+00A3>3 million worth), they departed the Hsi-Ku Arsenal in the early morning of 26 June, with the loss of 62 killed and 228 wounded.<ref>Account of the Seymour column in "The Boxer Rebellion", pgs 100-104, Diane Preston.</ref>

===Second intervention===
[[File:3090 recapture lg.jpg|thumb|The Boxers bombarded Tianjin in June 1900, and Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops attacked the British Admiral [[Seymour]] and his expeditionary force.]]

With a difficult military situation in Tianjin and a total breakdown of communications between Tianjin and Beijing, the allied nations took steps to reinforce their military presence significantly. On 17 June they took the Taku Forts commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and from there brought increasing numbers of troops on shore.

The international force with British Lieutenant-General [[Alfred Gaselee]] acting as the commanding officer of the Eight-Nation Alliance, eventually numbered 55,000, with the main contingent being composed of Japanese soldiers: Japanese (20,840), Russian (13,150), British (12,020), French (3,520), U.S.(3,420), German (900), Italian (80), Austro-Hungarian (75) and anti-Boxer Chinese troops.<ref>[http://www.russojapanesewar.com/boxers.html Russojapanesewarweb]</ref> The international force finally captured Tianjin on 14 July under the command of the Japanese Colonel [[Kuriya]], after one day of fighting.

[[Image:CaptureTianjin.jpg|thumb|left|The capture of the southern gate of Tianjin. British troops were positioned on the left, Japanese troops at the centre, French troops on the right.]]

Notable exploits during the campaign were the seizure of the [[Taku Forts]] commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and the boarding and capture of four Chinese destroyers by [[Roger John Brownlow Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]]. Among the foreigners besieged in Tianjin was a young American mining engineer named [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>Thompson, 96</ref>

The march from Tianjin to Beijing of about 120&nbsp;km consisted of about 20,000 allied troops. On 4 August there were approximately 70,000 Imperial troops with anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 Boxers along the way. They only encountered minor resistance and the battle was engaged in [[Battle of Yangcun|Yangcun]], about 30&nbsp;km outside Tianjin, where the [[14th Infantry Regiment]] of the U.S. and British troops led the assault. The weather was a major obstacle, extremely humid with temperatures sometimes reaching {{convert|110|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C|abbr=on}}.

[[Image:Siege of Peking, Boxer Rebellion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Calvin Pearl Titus|Corporal Titus]] scaling the walls of Peking.]]

The international force reached and occupied Beijing on 14 August.  All the nationalities in the international force raced to be the first to liberate the besieged Legation Quarter with the British winning the race. The U.S. was able to play a minor role, in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion due to the presence of U.S. ships and troops deployed in the Philippines since the U.S. conquest of the [[Spanish American War|Spanish American]] and [[Philippine-American War]]. In the U.S. military the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion was known as the [[China Relief Expedition]].  American soldiers scaling the walls of Beijing is one of the most iconic images of the Boxer Rebellion.<ref>Thompson, 177</ref>

==Looting  ==

[[Image:Beijing Castle Boxer Rebellion 1900 FINAL.jpg|thumb|right|"The Fall of the Peking Castle" from September 1900. British and Japanese soldiers assaulting Chinese troops.]]
The intermediate aftermath of the siege in Beijing was "an orgy of looting" by soldiers, civilians, and missionaries.<ref>Wang Ke-wen, ed. ''Modern China: An Encyclopedia of History, Culture, and Nationalism''. London: Taylor & Francis, 1998, p.34. This phrase "orgy of looting" also appears in many other books about the occupation of Beijing</ref> Each nationality in the expeditionary force accused the other of being the worst looters. An American diplomat, Herbert Squires, filled several railroad cars with loot.  The British Legation held loot auctions every afternoon and proclaimed, "looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly manner."  The Catholic North Cathedral was a "salesroom for stolen property."<ref>Chamberlin, Wilbur J. letter to his wife (11 December 1900), in ''Ordered to China: Letters of Wilbur J. Chamberlin: Written from China While Under Commission from the New York Sun During the Boxer Uprising of 1900 and the International Complications Which Followed,'' (New York: Frederick A. Stokes, 1903), p. 191</ref>
The American commander General [[Adna Chaffee]] banned looting by American soldiers, but the ban was ineffectual.<ref>Thompson, 194-197</ref>

The missionaries were the most condemned.  [[Mark Twain]] reflected American outrage against looting and imperialism in his essay, [[s:To the Person Sitting in Darkness|"To the Person Sitting in Darkness"]].   [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions|American Board]] Missionary [[William Scott Ament]] was his target.<ref>Thompson, 207-208</ref>   To provide restitution to missionaries and Chinese Christian families whose property had been destroyed, Ament guided American troops through villages to punish Boxers and confiscate their property. When Mark Twain read of this expedition, he wrote a scathing attack on the "Reverend bandits of the American Board."<ref>Fleming, The Siege at Peking, 136</ref>    Ament was one of the most respected and courageous missionaries in China and the controversy between him and Mark Twain was front page news during much of 1901.  Ament's counterpart on the distaff side was doughty British missionary Georgina Smith who presided over a neighborhood in Beijing as judge and jury.<ref>Thompson, 200, 204-214</ref>

The Imperial Army Muslim Kansu braves did not engage in indiscriminate slaughter, only targeting Christian spies near the legations.

==Occupation==

[[Image:BoxerRussianTroops.jpg|thumb|right|Russian troops in Beijing.]]
[[Image:BoxerAmericanTroops.jpg|thumb|American troops during the Boxer Rebellion.]]

Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities in northern China were occupied for more than one year by the international expeditionary force under the command of German General [[Alfred von Waldersee|Alfred Graf von Waldersee]]. The German force arrived too late to take part in the fighting, but undertook several punitive expeditions to the countryside against the Boxers. Although atrocities by foreign troops were common, German troops in particular were criticized for their enthusiasm in carrying out Kaiser Wilhelm II<U+2019>s words. On 27 July 1900 when Wilhelm II spoke during departure ceremonies for the German contingent to the relief force in China, an impromptu, but intemperate reference to the [[Hun]] invaders of continental Europe would later be resurrected by British propaganda to mock Germany during World War I and World War II.

{{quote|Just as the Huns a thousand years ago, under the leadership of Attila, gained a reputation by virtue of which they still live in historical tradition, so may the name Germany   become known in such a manner in China, that no Chinese will ever again dare to look askance at a German.|Michael Hunt|The Making of a Special Relationship: The United States and China to 1914<ref>Michael Hunt, The Making of a Special Relationship: The United States and China to 1914 (Columbia UP 1986): 286-88</ref>}}

The Germans were not the only offenders. On behalf of Chinese Catholics, French troops ravaged the countryside around Beijing to collect indemnities<U+2014>and on one occasion arresting Ament who, a one-man army, beat them to the punch in gathering wealth from some villages.  Nor were the soldiers of other nationalities any better behaved. "The Russian soldiers are ravishing the women and committing horrible atrocities" in the sector of Beijing they occupied.  The Japanese were noted for their skill in beheading Boxers or people suspected of being Boxers.  General Chaffee commented, "It is safe to say that where one real Boxer has been killed ...fifty harmless coolies or laborers on the farms, including not a few women and children, have been slain."<ref>Thompson, 199-204</ref>

On 7 September 1901, the Qing court was compelled to sign the "[[Boxer Protocol]]" also known as Peace Agreement between the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] and China. The protocol ordered the execution of 10 high-ranking officials linked to the outbreak and other officials who were found guilty for the slaughter of Westerners in China. The British signatory of the Protocol was Sir [[Ernest Satow]].

A Muslim, Ma Jun(<U+99AC><U+99FF>) brought a petition to the government which demanded that [[Xu Shichang]] must not sign the Boxer Protocol.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=s4Lp8tgr3esC&pg=PA44&dq=ma+jun+xu+shichang+paris+muslim#v=onepage&q=ma%20jun%20xu%20shichang%20paris%20muslim&f=false|title=Muslims in China|author=Aliya Ma Lynn|year=2007|publisher=University Press|location=|page=44|isbn=0880938617|pages=333|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

China was fined [[war reparations]] of 450,000,000 [[tael]] of fine silver (1 tael = 1.2 troy ounces) for the loss that it caused. The reparation would be paid within 39 years, and would be 982,238,150 taels with interests (4 percent per year) included. To help meet the payment it was agreed to increase the existing tariff from an actual 3.18 percent to 5 percent, and to tax hitherto duty-free merchandise. The sum of reparation was estimated by the Chinese population (roughly 450&nbsp;million in 1900), to let each Chinese pay one tael. Chinese custom income and salt tax were enlisted as guarantee of the reparation.<ref name="Hsu, 481"/>

China paid 668,661,220 taels of silver from 1901 to 1939, equivalent in 2010 to ~US$61 billion on a purchasing power parity basis [[Tael#Historical value|(see Tael)]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Image:Execution of Boxers after the rebellion.png|thumb|left|Execution of Boxers after the rebellion.]]A large portion of the reparations paid to the United States was diverted to pay for the education of Chinese students in U.S. universities under the [[Boxer Rebellion Indemnity Scholarship Program]]. To prepare the students chosen for this program an institute was established to teach the [[English language]] and to serve as a preparatory school for the course of study chosen. When the first of these students returned to China they undertook the teaching of subsequent students; from this institute was born [[Tsinghua University]]. Some of the reparation due to Britain was later earmarked for a similar program.

The China, or Inland Mission, lost more members than any other missionary agency:<ref>[http://www.archive.org/details/martyredmission02broogoog Archive.org]</ref>
58 adults and 21 children were killed. However, in 1901, when the allied nations were demanding compensation from the Chinese government, [[Hudson Taylor]] refused to accept payment for loss of property or life in order to demonstrate the meekness of Christ to the Chinese.<ref>Broomhall (1901), several pages</ref>

The [[Catholic]] Church engaged in lying to get foreign troops garrisoned in inner Mongolia. The French Catholic vicar apostolic, Msgr. Alfons Bermyn wanted foreign troops garrisoned in inner Mongolia, but the Governor refused. Bermyn resorted to lies, and falsely petitioned the Manchu [[Enming]] to send troops to [[Hetao]] where Prince Duan's Mongol troops and General Dong Fuxiang's Muslim troops allegedly threatened Catholics. It turned at that Bermyn had created the incident as a hoax.<ref name="Ann Heylen 2004 203">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WSl5cl_wt24C&pg=PA203&dq=ma+fuxiang+gelaohui#v=onepage&q=ma%20fuxiang%20gelaohui&f=false|title=Chronique du Toumet-Ortos: looking through the lens of Joseph Van Oost, missionary in Inner Mongolia (1915<U+2013>1921)|author=Ann Heylen|year=2004|publisher=Leuven University Press|location=Leuven, Belgium|page=203|isbn=90-5867-418-5|pages=409|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=z2japTNPRNAC&pg=PA539&dq=prince+mongol+general+whole+affair+hoax+catholic#v=snippet&q=dong%20fuxiang%20reportedly%20catholic%20mongol%20duan%20&f=false|title=Han-Mongol encounters and missionary endeavors: a history of Scheut in Ordos (Hetao) 1874<U+2013>1911|author=Patrick Taveirne|year=2004|publisher=Leuven University Press|location=Leuven, Belgium|page=539|isbn=90-5867-365-0|pages=684|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref> One of the false reports claimed that Dong Fuxiang wiped out Belgian missionaries in Mongolia and was going to massacre Catholics in Taiyuan.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=72AuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA167&dq=have+received+three+times+the+report+that+the+General+Tung+Fu+Hsiang,+in+West+Mongolia,+has+killed+all+Belgian#v=onepage&q=have%20received%20three%20times%20the%20report%20that%20the%20General%20Tung%20Fu%20Hsiang%2C%20in%20West%20Mongolia%2C%20has%20killed%20all%20Belgian&f=false|title=Fire and sword in Shansi: the story of the martyrdom of foreigners and Chinese Christians|author=E.

==Long-term results==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
The great powers stopped short of finally colonizing China. From the Boxer rebellions, they learned that the best way to govern China was through the Chinese dynasty, instead of direct dealing with the Chinese people (as a saying <U+201C>The people are afraid of officials, the officials are afraid of foreigners, and the foreigners are afraid of the people" (<U+8001><U+767E><U+59D3><U+6015><U+5B98><U+FF0C><U+5B98><U+6015><U+6D0B><U+9B3C><U+5B50><U+FF0C><U+6D0B><U+9B3C><U+5B50><U+6015><U+8001><U+767E><U+59D3>). Dowager Cixi used Boxers to fight foreigners largely because foreigners sympathized with the [[Guangxu Emperor]], who had been on house arrest  after an aborted reformation. Eventually, as an unwritten agreement, Dowager Cixi was allowed to stay in power, since comparatively, Cixi could use her influence to suppress the Chinese anti-western sentiment better than the weak and ineffectual Guangxu Emperor. The Guangxu Emperor spent the rest of his life in house arrest.

In October 1900 Russia was busy occupying much of the northeastern province of Manchuria, a move which threatened [[Anglo-American relations|Anglo-American]] hopes of maintaining what remained of China's territorial integrity and an openness to commerce under the [[Open Door Policy]]. This behavior led ultimately to the [[Russo-Japanese War]], where Russia was defeated at the hands of an increasingly confident Japan.

Among the Imperial powers, Japan gained prestige due to its military aid in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion and was now seen as a power. Its clash with Russia over Liaodong and other provinces in eastern Manchuria, long considered by the Japanese as part of their [[sphere of influence]], led to the Russo-Japanese War when two years of negotiations broke down in February 1904. The Russian Lease of the Liaodong (1898) was confirmed.

Besides the compensation, [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] reluctantly started some reformations despite her previous view. The [[imperial examination]] system for government service was eliminated; as a result, the [[Chinese classic texts|classical system of education]] was replaced with a [[Liberal arts|European liberal system]] that led to a university degree. After the death of Empress Dowager Cixi and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (on the same day, mysteriously) in 1908, the regent (Guangxu Emperor's brother) launched reformation. However, these efforts seemed to be too late. The revolutionaries within Han Chinese could not wait. The imperial government's humiliating failure to defend China against the foreign powers contributed to the growth of nationalist resentment against the "foreigner" Qing dynasty (who were descendants of the Manchu conquerors of China). By circumstance, the [[Qing Dynasty]], weakened by the war and the 1911 revolution, led by [[Sun Yat-sen]], became the last dynasty in Chinese history.

The effect on China was a weakening of the dynasty as well as a weakened national defense. The structure was temporarily sustained by the Europeans. Behind the international conflict, it further internally deepened the ideological differences between northern-Chinese anti-foreign royalists and southern-Chinese anti-Qing revolutionists. This scenario in the last Chinese dynasty gradually escalated to a chaotic [[warlord era]] in which the most powerful northern warlords were hostile towards the first Chinese republic in the south until the 1930s when the Chinese communists and Japanese imperialists became the greatest threats to the republic and the northern warlords respectively. Before the ultimate defeat of the Boxer Rebellion, all anti-Qing movements in the previous century such as the [[Taiping Rebellion]] were successfully suppressed by the Qing and her foreign collaborators.

==Conflicting depictions of Boxers==
[[File:Boxer-tianjing-left.jpeg|thumb|A company of Boxers in [[Tianjin]].]]

Views differ as to whether the Boxers are better seen as anti-imperialist or as futile opponents of inevitable change. In the People's Republic of China, orthodox textbooks used to analyze the Boxer movement as an anti-imperialist, patriotic peasant movement whose failure was due to the lack of leadership from the modern working class. In recent decades, however, large-scale projects of village interviews and explorations of archival sources have led historians to take a more nuanced view. Some Western scholars, such as Joseph Esherick, have seen the movement as anti-imperialist; while others view this interpretation as anachronistic in that the Chinese nation had not been formed and the Boxers were more concerned with regional issues. Esherick comments that "confusion about the Boxer Uprising is not simply a matter of popular misconceptions," for "there is no major incident in China's modern history on which the range of professional interpretation is so great.".<ref>Esherick, p, xiv</ref> Paul Cohen's recent history includes a survey of "the Boxers as myth," showing how their memory was used in changing ways in 20th-century China from the [[New Culture Movement]] to the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>Cohen, ''History in Three Keys'' Pt Three, "The Boxers As Myth."</ref>

[[Image:1900 killing of foreigners.jpg|thumb|left|In this cartoon, Westerners shown as pig and goat and being slaughtered by Manchu officials.]]

Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founding father of the [[Republic of China]] and of the [[Kuomintang]] party praised the Boxers for fighting against Western Imperialism. He said the Boxers were courageous and fearless, fighting to the death against the Western armies, Dr. Sun specifically cited the [[Battle of Yangcun]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=I0kvN9LDHP0C&pg=PA151&dq=yangcun+battle#v=onepage&q=yangcun%20battle&f=false|title=Critical Zone 3: A Forum of Chinese and Western Knowledge|author=Douglas Kerr|year=2009|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=|page=151|isbn=9622098576|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>

Some scholars consider it to be a war against the invasion of China by the foreign religion of Christianity.
