Phua criticised the PAP's "many helping hands" approach, where social services are provided by charities and overseen by the PAP. She said that [[special education]] should be led by the [[Ministry of Education]] (MOE), as it had more resources and expertise. [[Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports]] [[Vivian Balakrishnan]] defended the policy, arguing that it reduced bureaucracy and left jobs to the right people.<ref name="cow">Li Xueying, "Don't slay many helping hands sacred cow yet", ''The Straits Times'', 11 November 2006.</ref> However, the MOE agreed to play a more active role in special education, with increased funding and teacher training. The MOE also introduced more satellite classes in mainstream schools and helped special schools set targets for learning outcomes, such as [[O-Level]] passes.<ref name="needs">Derrick A Paulo, "Where needs be, a bit of special help", ''TODAY'', 8 March 2007.</ref><ref name="owner">"MOE takes greater ownership of pre-school and special needs education", ''Channel NewsAsia'', 7 March 2007.</ref>
