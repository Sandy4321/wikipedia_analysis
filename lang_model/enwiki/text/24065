The community of '''ethnic Chinese in Panama''' began to form in the latter half of the 19th century. The first group of Chinese labourers arrived in the country on [[30 March]], [[1854]] by way of [[Canada]] and [[Jamaica]] to work on the [[Panama Railroad]]. The community faced various challenges, including a 1903 law declaring them as "undesirable citizens", a 1928 law requiring them to submit special petitions in order to become Chinese citizens, and the revocation of their citizenship under the 1941 constitution promulgated by [[Arnulfo Arias]]. However, their citizenship was restored in 1946 under the new constitution which declared all people born in Panama to be citizens. Immigration slowed during the 1960s and 1970s, but resumed during the [[reform and opening up]] of China, as [[Deng Xiaopeng]]'s government began to relax emigration restrictions.<ref name="Jackson">{{cite magazine|title=Panama's Chinese community celebrates a birthday, meets new challenges|last=Jackson|first=Eric|volume=10|issue=9|date=May 2004|accessdate=2007-11-07|url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_10/issue_09/community_01.html|journal=The Panama News}}</ref> 

As of 2003, there were estimated to be 135,000 Chinese in Panama, including 80,000 new immigrants from mainland China and 300 from [[Taiwan]], served by thirty-five ethnic representative organisations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/panama/ch_pa01.htm#3|title=President Chen's State Visit to Panama|publisher=Government Information Office, Republic of China|date=October 2003|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> In the aftermath of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], many mainland Chinese fled to Panama by way of Hong Kong on temporary visas and short-term residency permits; estimates of the size of the influx ranged from 9,000 to 35,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Officials Brace for Exodus of Foreigners from Panama|publisher=The New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE5DE1F38F93BA25755C0A966958260|date=[[1990-06-18]]|accessdate=2007-11-07|last=Johnston|first=David}}</ref> Most new arrivals speak [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], or [[Hakka (linguistics)|Hakka]]; they are less educated than earlier arrivals, and their presence has caused internal tensions within the Chinese community.<ref name="Jackson"/>
