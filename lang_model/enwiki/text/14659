The '''Wyoming State Legislature''' is the [[legislative branch]] of the [[U.S. State]] of [[Wyoming]]. It is a [[bicameral]] [[state legislature]], consisting of a 60 member [[Wyoming House of Representatives]], and a 30 member [[Wyoming Senate]]. The legislature meets at the [[Wyoming State Capitol]] in [[Cheyenne, WY|Cheyenne]]. 

==History==
The Wyoming State Legislature began like other [[US Western States|Western states]] as a territorial legislature, with nearly (though with not all) the parliamentary regulations that guide other fully-fledged [[state legislature|state legislatures]]. 

===Women's Suffrage===
During its territorial era, the Wyoming Legislature played a crucial role in the [[Women's suffrage|Suffragette Movement in the United States]]. In [[1869]], only four years following the [[American Civil War]], and another 35 years before women's suffrage became a highly visible political issue in both the [[United States|U.S.]], [[U.K.|Britain]] and elsewhere, the Wyoming Legislature granted all women above the age of 21 the right to vote. The legislature's move made [[Wyoming]] the first portion of the U.S. where women were explicitly granted the voting franchise. News spread quickly to other neighboring territories and states. In [[1870]], the [[Utah State Legislature|Utah Territorial Legislature]] similarly granted the voting franchise to women. 

The move by the legislature was motivated by a number of factors, including bringing [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern]] women to the territory to increase its population, to publicize the new territory, to bring more voters into the fold for existing political elites, and by genuine concerns that women should be allowed the vote. 

Due to the territory's change of voting laws in [[1869]], the anti-suffrage [[U.S. Congress]] was hostile to Wyoming and its legislature. During proceedings to make Wyoming a [[U.S. state]] in [[1889]] and [[1890]] in writing a new [[state constitution|constitution]], which would continue female suffrage, Congress threatened to withhold [[statehood]] unless the law was changed. The Wyoming Legislature and territorial government sent a threatening telegram back to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], stating that Wyoming would remain out of the [[United States]] 100 years rather than become a state without women's suffrage. The federal Congress withdrew its threat, and on [[July 10]], [[1890]], [[Benjamin Harrison|President Benjamin Harrison]] signed into law Wyoming becoming the 44th U.S. state. 

Wyoming's early entry into female politics continued into the 20th century. In [[1925]], [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[Nellie Tayloe Ross|Nellie Tayloe Ross]] became the first elected female [[governor]] of a U.S. state.

==Population==
Wyoming remains the smallest state by population in the United States. However, the Wyoming Legislature is not the smallest. The [[Nebraska Legislature]], with only 49 members, is the smallest legislative body out of the 50 states.
