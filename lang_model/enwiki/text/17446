It has a capacity for 35,000 spectators and is one of three national ski jumping hills in Norway.

Architects were <U+00D8>KAW Architects, with Martin M. Bakken as the main contractor. Construction had already stated earlier in 1990, and it was completed by December 1992. The seating area was made with pre-fabricated concrete elements with metal bars. Temporary buildings and facilities for the opening ceremonies were installed in December 1993, and removed after the Olympics.<ref name=iii18>LOOC (III): 18</ref> This included 70 commentator boxes, a media center and offices for technical personnel.<ref name=iii21>LOOC (III): 21</ref> The original construction included plastic on the outrun and porcelain tracks, allowing jumping during summer. The venue was placed deep in the terrain to shield the jumpers from the wind while minimizing the venue's impact in the surroundings.<ref>LOOC (III): 22</ref> In 2007, the large hill was renovated. The profile for the large hill was changed, increasing the K-point from 120 to 123. In addition, plastic way laid on the large hill.<ref name=olympiapark />

It also features a high-pressure snow production facility with outtakes all along the approach and outrun. Transport to the tower of the large hill is accessible via a [[chair lift]].<ref name=iii21 />  During the Olympics, transport to the venues was mostly by railway.
