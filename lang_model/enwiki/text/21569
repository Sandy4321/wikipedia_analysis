'''Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]] (4 April 1900&nbsp;<U+2013> 1 March 1942) was a senior officer in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). In a career spanning almost thirty years, he served in both world wars. At the helm of [[HMAS Stuart (D00)|HMAS ''Stuart'']] in the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and [[flotilla]] commander. He then transferred to the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] as captain of the light cruiser [[HMAS Perth (D29)|HMAS ''Perth'']], and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the [[Battle of Sunda Strait]] in early 1942.

Born in [[Benalla]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Waller entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] at the age of thirteen. After graduating, he served with the [[Royal Navy]] (RN) in the closing stages of World War&nbsp;I. Between the wars, he specialised in communications and was posted as signals officer to various British and Australian warships. He gained his first seagoing command in 1937, as captain of [[HMS Brazen (H80)|HMS ''Brazen'']]. In September 1939, he took charge of HMAS ''Stuart'' and four other obsolete destroyers that together became known as the "[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]". In 1940, these were augmented by other ships to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, supporting Allied troops in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].

Waller was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and [[Medal bar|Bar]], and twice [[mentioned in despatches]], for his achievements in the Mediterranean. He assumed command of HMAS ''Perth'' in October 1941, taking part in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]] shortly before his final action in Sunda Strait. He received a third mention in despatches posthumously, and in 2011 came under formal consideration for the award of the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) for his performance as ''Perth'''s captain. The submarine [[HMAS Waller (SSG 75)|HMAS ''Waller'']] is named in his honour.

==Early life and World War I==

In February 1919, Waller was assigned to the light cruiser [[HMAS Melbourne (1912)|HMAS ''Melbourne'']], and two months later returned to Australia.<ref name="Goldrick2002"/> He transferred to the light cruiser [[HMAS Sydney (1912)|HMAS ''Sydney]] as an acting [[sub-lieutenant]] in September; his rank was made substantive the following month.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 October 1919)| location=Melbourne|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1919.pdf|page=33|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 October 1920)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1920.pdf|page=22|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> In April 1920 he was again posted aboard ''Melbourne''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)| title=The Navy List (1 January 1921)| location=Melbourne| url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-January-1921.pdf|page=30|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> Promoted to [[lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] in March 1921, he went through further training in Britain before returning to join the staff of the RANC. Waller married Nancy Bowes, a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]'s daughter, on 7&nbsp;April 1923 in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Lewisham, New South Wales|Lewisham]]; the couple had two sons, Michael and John.

By this stage of his career, Waller had acquired a strong reputation for his communications work.

===HMAS ''Stuart'' in the Mediterranean===

At the [[Military history of Australia in World War II|outbreak of World War II]], Waller was appointed captain of [[HMAS Stuart (D-00/100)|HMAS ''Stuart'']], taking charge of a group of four other obsolete ex-RN destroyers<U+2014>[[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMA Ships ''Vampire'']], [[HMAS Vendetta (D69)|''Vendetta'']], [[HMAS Voyager (D31)|''Voyager'']], and [[HMAS Waterhen (D22)|''Waterhen'']]<U+2014>that the Germans later nicknamed the "[[Scrap Iron Flotilla]]".<ref name="Goldrick2002"/><ref>Frame (2004), ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 153.</ref> The ships were en route to [[Singapore]] for training when the British and Australian governments agreed that they should be assigned to the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean]] as the 19th Destroyer Division, under Waller's control.<ref name="RAN in WWII">Stevens (1996), ''The Royal Australian Navy in World War II'', p. 67.</ref> Arriving at [[Malta]] in late December, Waller made a positive initial impression on senior RN commanders; this was soon borne out by his actions during the salvage of the ''Trocas'', a disabled tanker. In May 1940, he was appointed to command the 10th Destroyer Flotilla, which included the vessels of the "Scrap Iron Flotilla" plus four modern British destroyers, and a month later was promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captain]].<ref name="Goldrick2002"/><ref name="RAN in WWII"/>

Following Italy's entry into the war on 10&nbsp;June 1940, Waller was involved in the search for minefields off the North African coast. A keen shooter, he personally blew up floating mines using a rifle and armour-piercing bullets. On 21&nbsp;June, ''Stuart'' shelled the Italian-held town of [[Bardia]].<ref name="Lewis 9">Lewis (2004), "The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader", pp. 9<U+2013>10.</ref> The next month, his 10th Destroyer Flotilla participated in the [[Battle of Calabria]].<ref name="Goldrick2002"/> Waller's ships carried out bombardments on [[Fort Capuzzo]] on 17&nbsp;August and an Italian seaplane base in the [[Gulf of Bomba]] one week later.<ref>Gill (1957), [http://www.awm.gov.au/collection/records/awmohww2/navy/vol1/awmohww2-navy-vol1-ch5.pdf ''Royal Australian Navy, 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp. 206<U+2013>207].</ref> In September, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for "courage, enterprise, and devotion to duty on recent engagements"<U+2014>in particular, his pinpointing of enemy minefields.<ref name="Lewis 9"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34943|date=10 September 1940|startpage=5469|supp=yes|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}</ref> The same month, he transferred to HMAS ''Vampire'' while ''Stuart'' went in for refit.<ref name="Lewis 10">Lewis (2004), "The Navy's Finest Fighting Leader", pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref> As the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies began to [[Operation Compass|counterattack Italian forces]] in December 1940, the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]], Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Sir Andrew Cunningham]], gave Waller command of the newly formed Inshore Squadron, comprising destroyers, minesweepers, and auxiliaries.
