The '''spinner shark''', ''Carcharhinus brevipinna'', is a species of [[requiem shark]], [[family (biology)|family]] Carcharhinidae, named for the spinning leaps it makes as a part of its feeding strategy. This species occurs in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide, except for in the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is found from coastal to offshore habitats to a depth of 100 m (330 ft), though it prefers shallow water. The spinner shark resembles a larger version of the [[blacktip shark]] (''C. limbatus''), with a slender body, long snout, and black-marked fins. This species can be distinguished from the blacktip shark by the first [[dorsal fin]], which has a different shape and is placed further back, and by the black tip on the [[anal fin]] (in adults only). It attains a maximum length of 3 m (10 ft).

Spinner sharks are swift and gregarious [[predator]]s that feed on a wide variety of small [[bony fish]]es and [[cephalopod]]s. When feeding on [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]] of [[forage fish]], they will speed vertically through the school while spinning on their axis, erupting from the water at the end. Like other members of its family, the spinner shark is [[viviparous]], with females bearing litters of 3&ndash;20 young every other year. The newborns are born in shallow nursery areas near the coast, and are relatively fast-growing. This species is not usually dangerous to humans but may become belligerent when excited by food. Spinner sharks are valued by [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] across their range for their meat, fins, [[shark liver oil|liver oil]], and skin. They are also esteemed as strong fighters by [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]]. The [[World Conservation Union]] has assessed this species as [[Near Threatened]] worldwide and [[Vulnerable]] off the southeastern [[United States]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The spinner shark was originally described as ''Carcharias (Aprion) brevipinna'' by [[Johannes Peter M<U+00FC>ller]] and [[Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle]] in their 1839 ''Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen'', based on the mounted skin of a 79 cm (31 in) long specimen collected off [[Java]].<ref name="compagno">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |date=1984 |title=Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date |place=Rome |publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization |isbn=9251013845 |pages=466&ndash;468}}</ref> This species was subsequently moved to the genera ''Aprion'', ''Squalus'', and ''Aprionodon'' before being placed within the genus ''Carcharhinus''.<ref name="bester">Bester, C.

Retrieved on May 7, 2009.</ref> The tooth shape and coloration of this species varies significantly with age and between geographical regions, which caused much taxonomic confusion.<ref name="compagno"/> Other common names include blacktipped shark, great blacktip shark, inkytail shark, large blacktip shark, long-nose grey shark, longnose grey whaler, and smoothfang shark.<ref name="fishbase">{{fishbase species |genus=Carcharhinus |species=brevipinna |month=May |year=2009}}</ref>

Based on similarities in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], tooth shape, and behavior, the closest relatives of the spinner shark were originally believed to be the [[blacktip shark]] and the [[graceful shark]] (''C. amblyrhynchoides'').<ref>Garrick, J.A.F. (1982). "Sharks of the genus ''Carcharhinus''". NOAA Technical Report, NMFS CIRC-445.</ref> However, this interpretation was not supported by an [[allozyme]] analysis conducted by Naylor in 1992, suggesting that these similarities are the product of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Naylor, G.J.P. |title=The phylogenetic relationships among requiem and hammerhead sharks: inferring phylogeny when thousands of equally most parsimonious trees result |journal=Cladistics |volume=8 |date=1992 |pages=295&ndash;318}}</ref> In a 2007 [[ribosomal DNA]] study by Dosay-Akbulut, the spinner shark was found to be the most divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the [[tiger shark]] (''Galeocerdo cuvier''), being less related to other ''Carcharhinus'' species than the [[lemon shark]] (''Negaprion brevirostris'').<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dosay-Akbulut, M. |title=The phylogenetic relationship within the genus ''Carcharhinus'' |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=331 |issue=7 |date=2008 |pages=500&ndash;509}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Some uncertainty exists in the distribution data for the spinner shark due to confusion with the blacktip shark. In the western [[Atlantic Ocean]], it occurs from [[North Carolina]] to the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], including the [[Bahamas]] and [[Cuba]], and from southern [[Brazil]] to [[Argentina]]. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs from off [[North Africa]] to [[Namibia]]. In the [[Indian Ocean]], it is found from [[South Africa]] and [[Madagascar]], to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]], to [[India]] and nearby islands, to [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]]. In the [[Pacific Ocean]] it occurs off [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], [[Australia]], and possibly the [[Philippines]].<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="bester"/> Parasitological evidence suggests that Indian Ocean spinner sharks have passed through the [[Suez Canal]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Biological Invasions in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin |author=Castri, F., Hansen, A.J. and Debussche, M. |edition=second |publisher=Springer |date=1990 |page=300 |isbn=079230411X}}</ref>

The spinner shark has been reported from ocean surface to a depth of 100 m (330 ft), though it prefers shallow water less than 30 m (100 ft) deep, and occupies all levels of the water column. This species may be found from coastal waters to well offshore, over continental and insular shelves. Juveniles have been known to enter bays but avoid [[brackish]] conditions. The northwest Atlantic population is  [[fish migration|migratory]]; in spring and summer they are found in warm inshore waters, and in winter they move south into deeper water.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="bester"/>

==Description==
[[Image:Carcharhinus brevipinna drawing.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Illustration of a spinner shark and its tooth]] The spinner shark has a slim, streamlined body with a distinctive long, pointed snout. The eyes are small and circular. There are prominent forward-pointing furrows at the corners of the mouth. The tooth rows number 15&ndash;18 in each half of the upper jaw and 14&ndash;17 in each half of the lower jaw, with 2 and 1 tiny symphysial (central) teeth respectively. The teeth have long, narrow central cusps and are finely serrated in the upper jaw and smooth in the lower jaw. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are long.

The first [[dorsal fin]] is relatively small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the [[pectoral fin]]s. There is no ridge between the first and second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped).<ref name="compagno"/> The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped [[dermal denticle]]s with 7 (rarely 5) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin. The average spinner shark is 2 m (6.4 ft) long and weighs 56 kg (123 lbs); this species attains a maximum known length and weight of 3 m (10 ft) and 90 kg (198 lbs). Indo-Pacific sharks are generally larger than those from the northwest Atlantic.<ref name="bester"/>

==Biology and ecology==
The spinner shark is a fast, active swimmer that sometimes forms large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], segregated by age and sex. Young individuals prefer cooler water temperatures than adults.<ref>{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V, Dando, M. and Fowler, S. |title=Sharks of the World |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=293&ndash;294 |isbn=9780691120713 |date=2005}}</ref> Off South Africa, females are found close to shore year-round while males only appear during the summer.<ref name="van der elst and borchert"/> Smaller spinner sharks may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known [[parasite]]s of the spinner shark include the [[copepod]]s ''Kroyeria deetsi'', ''Nemesis pilosus'', and ''N. atlantica'', which infest the shark's gills, ''Alebion carchariae'', which infests the skin, ''Nesippus orientalis'', which infests the mouth and [[gill arch]]es, and ''Perissopus dentatus'', which infests the [[nares]] and the rear margins of the fins.<ref name="bester"/>

===Feeding===
Spinner sharks feed primarily on small bony fishes, including [[Elops|tenpounders]], [[sardine]]s, [[herring]], [[anchovy|anchovies]], [[Ariidae|sea catfish]], [[lizardfish]], [[mullet (fish)|mullet]]s, [[bluefish]], [[tuna]]s, [[bonito]], [[Sciaenidae|croakers]], [[Carangidae|jacks]], [[mojarra]]s, and [[Cynoglossidae|tongue-soles]]. They have also been known to eat [[stingray]]s, [[cuttlefish]], [[squid]], and [[octopus]].<ref name="compagno"/> Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed.<ref name="heemstra">{{cite book |title=Coastal Fishes of Southern Africa |author=Heemstra, E. |publisher=NISC (PTY) LTD |date=2004 |isbn=1920033017 |page=58}}</ref> Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting [[dentition]].<ref name="van der elst and borchert"/> This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish: the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum at the end of these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="marinebio">{{cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=492|title=''Carcharhinus brevipinna'', Spinner Shark |publisher=MarineBio.org|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref> The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often.<ref name="bester"/> Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around [[shrimp]] [[trawler]]s to feed on the discarded [[bycatch]], and may be incited into [[feeding frenzy|feeding frenzies]].<ref name="compagno"/>

===Life history===
Like other requiem sharks, the spinner shark is [[viviparous]]. Adult females have a single functional [[ovary]] and two functional [[uterus]]es; each uterus is divided into compartments, one for each [[embryo]]. The embryos are initially sustained by a [[yolk sac]]. When the embryo grows to around 19 cm (7.5 in) long, the supply of yolk has been exhausted and the empty yolk sac develops into a [[placenta]]l connection through which the mother provides nutrients for the remainder of [[gestation]]. This species has the smallest [[ova]] relative to the fully developed embryo  of any viviparous shark known.<ref name="capape et al">{{cite journal |author=Capape, C., Hemida, F., Seck, A.A., Diatta, Y., Guelorget, O. and Zaouali, J. |date=2003 |title=Distribution and reproductive biology of the spinner shark, ''Carcharhinus brevipinna'' (Muller and Henle, 1841) (Chondrichthyes: Carcharhinidae) |journal=Israel Journal of Zoology |volume=49 |pages=269&ndash;286}}</ref> Females give birth to 3&ndash;20 (usually 7&ndash;11) pups every other year, after a gestation period of 11&ndash;15 months. Mating occurs from early spring to summer, and parturition  in August off North Africa, from April to May off South Africa, and from March to April in the northwestern Atlantic.<ref name="capape et al"/><ref name="fowler et al"/> Young are birthed in coastal nursery areas such as bays, beaches, and high-salinity estuaries in water deeper than 5 m (20 ft).<ref name="fowler et al"/>

The length at birth is 66&ndash;77 cm (26&ndash;30 in) in the northwestern Atlantic,<ref name="fowler et al"/> 61&ndash;69 cm (24&ndash;27 in) off Tunisia,<ref name="capape et al"/> and 60 cm (24 in) off South Africa.<ref name="van der elst and borchert"/> Spinner sharks are relatively fast-growing sharks: 30 cm (12 in) per year for newborns, 25 cm (10 in) per year for one-year-olds, 10 cm (4 in) per year for adolescents, and 5 cm (2 in) per year for adults. In the northwestern Atlantic, males mature at 1.3 m (4.3 ft) long and females at 1.5&ndash;1.6 m (4.9&ndash;5.2 ft) long, corresponding to ages of 4&ndash;5 years and 7&ndash;8 years respectively.<ref name="fowler et al"/> Off South Africa, males mature at 1.8 m (5.9 ft) and females at 2.1 m (6.9 ft).<ref name="van der elst and borchert">{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Common Sea Fishes of Southern Africa |author=Van der Elst, R. and Borchert, P. |edition=third |publisher=Struik |date=1993 |isbn=1868253945 |page=36}}</ref> Spinner sharks generally do not reproduce until they are 12&ndash;14 years old. The lifespan has been estimated at 15&ndash;20 years or more.<ref name="fowler et al">{{cite book |author=Fowler, S.L., Cavanagh, R.D., Camhi, M., Burgess, G.H., Cailliet, G.M., Fordham, S.V., Simpfendorfer, C.A. and Musick, J.A. |title=Sharks, Rays and Chimaeras: The Status of the Chondrichthyan Fishes |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |date=2005 |isbn=2831707005 |pages=106&ndash;109, 287&ndash;288}}</ref>

==Relationship to humans==
Ordinarily,  spinner sharks do not pose a substantial danger to humans; they do not perceive large [[mammal]]s as prey as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited by the presence of food, and so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while [[spearfishing]].<ref name="compagno"/> As of 2008, the [[International Shark Attack File]] listed 16 unprovoked attacks and 1 provoked attack attributable to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.<ref>[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/species2.htm ISAF Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark]. International Shark Attack File, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida. Retrieved on May 7, 2009.</ref>

The meat of the spinner shark is of high quality and sold fresh or dried and salted. In addition, the fins are used for [[shark fin soup]] in [[East Asia]], the [[shark liver oil|liver oil]] is processed for [[vitamin]]s, and the skin is made into [[leather]] products. Spinner sharks are an important catch of the US commercial shark fisheries operating in the northwestern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. The meat is marketed under the name "blacktip shark" in the United States, due to that species being considered superior in quality by consumers. It is likely also caught by other fisheries across its range, going unreported owing to confusion with the blacktip shark.<ref name="fowler et al"/> The spinner shark is also highly regarded by recreational fishers, being described as a "spectacular fighter" that often leaps out of the water.<ref>{{cite book |title=Coastal Fishing in the Carolinas: From Surf, Pier, and Jetty |author=Goldstein, R.J. |edition=third |publisher=John F. Blair |date=2000 |isbn=0895871955 |page=129}}</ref> The [[World Conservation Union]] has assessed this species as [[Near Threatened]] worldwide and [[Vulnerable]] in the northwest Atlantic; its frequent use of coastal habitats render it vulnerable to human exploitation and [[habitat degradation]].<ref name="iucn"/> The Northwest Atlantic fishery for this species is managed under the US [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) 1999 Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish and Sharks. For the purposes of commercial quotas and recreational bag limits, the spinner shark is categorized as a "Large Coastal Shark" (LCS).<ref name="fowler et al"/>
