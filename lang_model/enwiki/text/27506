The'''Vizcaya Regional Championship,''called''' North Regional Championships'''in its early editions, was a football official tournament Spain, organized by the Federation Cup Vizca<U+00ED>na-before Federation in the North-affiliated clubs involved in this.

It is played annually between 1913 and 1940 and served to elect the representative of the region in the [[Copa del Rey|Championship in Spain]].

== History ==

The tournament was launched in 1913, following the creation of the Northern Football Federation, initially consisting of clubs from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque provinces]] ([[province of Vizcaya|Vizcaya]], [[province of Guipuzcoa|Guip<U+00FA>zcoa]] and [[province of <U+00C1>lava|<U+00C1>lava]]) and the [[Cantabria|province of Santander]]. The first edition of the Northern Regional Championship started on 12 October 1913, with six teams: three Vizcaya ([[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Arenas Club de Getxo]] and Sports Bilbao) and three Gipuzkoa ([[Royal Society]], [[Real Union Irun|Sporting de Irun]] and [[Real Union Irun|Racing de Irun]]). Athletic was the first champion.

In 1916 the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] agreed that the clubs [[Cantabria|Santander]] North to abandon the federation added to the newly formed Federation Cantabrian, but reinstated it again two years later.

After several disagreements between the clubs [[province of Vizcaya|Vizcaya]] and [[province of Guipuzcoa|Guip<U+00FA>zcoa]] in 1918 the National Committee of the Spanish federation agreed to divide the Northern Federation in these two regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/preview/1918/05/07/pagina-2/607728/pdf.html|title= Vizcaya-Gu<U+00ED>p<U+00FA>scoa The lawsuit gives the contrast with National Committee | accessdate= May 3, 2009 | date = 07.05.1918 | publisher = [[El Mundo Deportivo]]}}</ref> Thus, the 1918/19 season Gipuzkoa clubs launched their own championship while the North Championship teams continued Basques and re-entry of the [[Racing de Santander]], representing the Cantabrian club.

In 1922 the clubs in the province of Santander finally left North Federation to create its own umbrella organization, which launched the [[Cantabria Regional Championship (soccer)|Cantabrian Regional Championship]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/preview/1922/10/30/pagina-4/612805/pdf.html|title= The conflicts of the Spanish soccer | accessdate= May 3, 2009 | date = 30-10-1922 | publisher = [[El Mundo Deportivo]]}}</ref> That same year, the Assembly of the Northern Federation agreed to the change of name to the Federation Biscayne team being composed exclusively of the [[province of Vizcaya]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://hemeroteca.elmundodeportivo.es/preview/1922/07/24/pagina-3/612364/pdf.html|title= Federation Federation North becomes Vizca<U+00ED>na | accessdate= 3 May 2009 | date = 24.07.1922 | publisher= [[El Mundo Deportivo]]}}</ref>

In 1934 the Spanish federation took out a major restructuring of the national tournaments, so that the regional championships were replaced by the superregional, which gathered the best clubs in various regional federations. In the case of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], from the season 1934/35 was launched called [[Basque Cup]]. This tournament was held for two years until being interrupted by the summary of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

In 1939 during the last months of the race war, football was resumed activity in some areas controlled by the [[national side]], under the impetus of the Spanish Federation and the regional federations. In the reborn Championship Vizcaya five teams participated, including the champion and runner-up (Athletic Bilbao and [[Barakaldo CF footballers|Barakaldo Oriamendi]]) took part in the [[Copa del Rey|Copa del Generalissimo]].

The 1939/40 season was played the last edition of the Championship of Biscay, which was also a qualifier for access to the Championship of Spain, since then called the Copa del Generalissimo (later turned into [[Copa del Rey]]). The restructuring approved by the Spanish Federation on 1940 marked the demise of the regional championships.
