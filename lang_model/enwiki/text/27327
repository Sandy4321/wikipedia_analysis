'''Robert Wise''' ([[September 10]], [[1914]] &ndash; [[September 14]], [[2005]]) was an [[United States|American]] sound effects editor, film editor, and [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[United States|American]] film producer and director. Among his many famous films are ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[The Hindenburg (film)|The Hindenburg]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''; ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]''; ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|The Andromeda Strain]]'', ''[[The Set-Up]]'', ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'', and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]''. Wise's working period spanned the [[1930s in film|1930s]] to the [[1990s in film|1990s]].

Often contrasted with contemporary "[[auteur]]" directors such as [[Stanley Kubrick]] who tended to bring a distinctive directorial "look" to a particular genre, Wise is famously viewed to have allowed his (sometimes studio assigned) story dictate style. Later critics such as [[Martin Scorsese]] would go on to expand that characterization, insisting that despite Wise's notorious workaday concentration on stylistic perfection within the confines of genre and budget, his choice of subject matter and approach still functioned to identify Wise as an artist and not merely an artisan. Through whatever means, Wise's approach would bring him critical success as a director in many different traditional film genres: from [[Horror film|horror]] to [[Noir film|noir]] to [[Western (genre)|Western]] to [[war film]]s to [[Science Fiction]], to [[musical film|musical]] and [[drama]], with many repeat hits within each genre. Wise's tendency towards professionalism led to a degree of preparedness  which, though nominally motivated by studio budget constraints, nevertheless advanced the moviemaking art, with many [[Academy Award]]-winning films the result.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in [[Winchester, Indiana|Winchester]], [[Indiana]], Wise began his movie career at [[RKO]] as a sound and music editor, but he soon grew to being nominated for the [[Academy Award for Film Editing]] for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' in 1941: Wise was that film's last living crew member. 

Though Wise worked only as editor on ''Citizen Kane'', it is likely that while working on the film he would become familiar with the optical printer techniques employed by [[Linwood Dunn]], inventor of the practical [[optical printer]], to produce effects for ''Citizen Kane ''such as the image projected in the broken [[snowglobe]] which falls from Kane's hand as he dies. Though Wise was never known as a special-effects-driven director, echos of this 1940s high-tech special effects technology were to emerge in several of his important later films, such as ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'', ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. Wise could also make a movie special in the use of technique borrowed from one genre but applied to another genre: in his hands, a science fiction movie might acquire mood from a "haunted house" film, and vice versa. Wise sought never to waste the time (or salary) of the talented people who produced his features: the result was an impressively prolific series of films which showcase the talents of director, cast, and crew.

Wise attended [[Connersville High School]] in [[Connersville, Indiana|Connersville]], Indiana, and its auditorium, the [[Robert E. Wise Center for Performing Arts]], is named in his honor.

In March of 1987, Wise accepted the Academy Award for Best Actor, on behalf of his absent friend, [[Paul Newman]], who won for his performance in [[The Color of Money]].

===Wise becomes a director===
First called as assistant director to shoot additional scenes for Welles's ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', Wise took his first directing job with the stylish horror film ''[[The Curse of the Cat People]]'' in 1944, teaming with Hollywood horror producer/director [[Val Lewton]].  Lewton promoted Wise to his superiors at RKO, beginning a collaboration which would produce several notable horror films, among them ''[[The Body Snatcher]]'' starring Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, a film which in its acting direction deliberately evoked the groundbreaking horror films of the 1930s, while presenting a psychological horror film more in tune with the uncertainty of the 1940s.

In [[1947 in film|1947]], Wise directed the [[Lawrence Tierney]] noir classic ''[[Born to Kill (1947 film)|Born to Kill]]'' and two years later directed the boxing movie ''[[The Set-Up (1949)|The Set-Up]]'', where his direction of the real-time setting got him noticed. Wise's use and mention of time in this film would find echos in later [[noir]] films such as Stanley Kubrick's ''[[The Killing]]'' and Quentin Tarantino's ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''.

In the 1950s, Wise proved adept in several genres, from the [[science fiction]] of ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' to the melodramatic ''[[So Big]]'', to the epic ''[[Helen of Troy]]'' based on Homer, to Susan Hayward's Oscar winner in ''[[I Want to Live!]]'', for which he was nominated for [[Academy Award for Directing|Best Director]].

In 1961, teamed with [[Jerome Robbins]], he won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', which he also produced. In 1963 he directed arguably the scariest horror film ever made, ''The Haunting'', with Julie Harris.  He won the Academy Award for Best Director in 1965 with ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''. 

''The Sound of Music'' was an interim film for Wise, produced to mollify the studio while he developed the difficult film ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'', starring [[Steve McQueen]], [[Richard Attenborough]] and [[Candice Bergen]]. Set in the late 1920s in [[China]], this was Wise's entry in a spate of [[Vietnam war]] era films (''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'', ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]''), which, though set in other periods of wartime, nevertheless sounded with its depictions of [[gunboat diplomacy]] what would come to be recognized as timeless themes. Wise would later speak of ''The Sand Pebbles'' as the film he most wanted to direct, though he had earlier explored such anti-war themes in movies such as ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]''.

In the 1970s he directed such films as ''[[The Andromeda Strain (film)|The Andromeda Strain]]'', ''[[The Hindenburg (1975 film)|The Hindenburg]]'', the horror film ''[[Audrey Rose (film)|Audrey Rose]]'', and the first [[Star Trek]] film, ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. In 1989 he directed ''Rooftops'', his last theatrical feature film.

===Later years===
Even in his twilight years, Wise continued to be active in productions of DVD versions of his films, even making public appearances promoting those films.

Wise was a past president of both the [[Directors Guild of America]] and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. He has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6338 Hollywood Blvd.

After suffering a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at home, Wise was rushed to [[UCLA Medical Center]], where he died from heart failure. He died on [[14 September]] [[2005]], four days after his 91st birthday.
