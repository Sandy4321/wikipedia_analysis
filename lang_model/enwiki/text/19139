'''Todd Blanchfield''' (born 11 July 1991) is an Australian professional [[basketball]] player who currently plays for the [[Southland Sharks]] of the New Zealand [[National Basketball League (New Zealand)|National Basketball League]] (NZNBL). The 200&nbsp;cm [[swingman]] rose up the ranks of Mackay basketball before attending the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] and representing [[Australia men's national basketball team|Australia]] in international competition.

==Early life and career==
Born and raised in [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], Blanchfield attended Mackay State High School where he had success with schoolboys basketball, being selected in his first state team when he was in Year 7 and was part of Mackay representative teams from under 12s. In 2007, Blanchfield played his first season with the [[Queensland Basketball League|QBL]]'s Mackay Meteors and was a valuable part of the team, despite being just 15-years-old.<ref name=mack>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/apn-blanchfield-makes-some-big/72697/ | title=Blanchfield makes some big strides | work=DailyMercury.com.au | date=5 February 2008 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>

In January 2008, Blanchfield's career began to flourish as he travelled to [[North Carolina]] on an Australian schoolboys tour, and attended an [[Australian Institute of Sport|AIS]] development camp for the under 19 Australian Emus squad.<ref name="mack" /> He made the final Emus squad and travelled to Germany in March 2008 for the [[Albert Schweitzer Tournament]], going on to help the team defeat the United States to claim bronze.<ref name=emus>{{cite web | url=http://www.basketball.net.au/emus-squad-named-for-june-camp/ | title=EMUS SQUAD NAMED FOR JUNE CAMP | work=Basketball.net.au | date=26 May 2008 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> Following the tournament, he started playing in the [[South East Australian Basketball League|SEABL]] for the AIS,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/apn-todd-on-rapid-rise-to/72310/ | title=Todd on rapid rise to top | work=DailyMercury.com.au | date=22 April 2008 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> and in 12 total games, he averaged five points and two rebounds per game.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.seabl.com.au/uploads/media/mais_02.pdf | title=Australian Institute of Sport <U+2013> 2009 SEABL preview | work=SEABL.com.au | accessdate=6 March 2015 | format=PDF}}</ref> He later re-joined the Emus for the 2008 [[William Jones Cup]], where the team again captured bronze.<ref name="emus" />

Blanchfield returned to the Mackay Meteors for the 2009 QBL season and was very impressive in recording averages of 20.7 points, 7.7 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 19 games, and earning the QBL U23 Youth Player of the Year. He subsequently earned himself a development player spot on the [[Townsville Crocodiles]], signing a 12-month contract with the team in July 2009.<ref>{{cite web | last=Boxall | first=Sally | url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/Townsville-Blanchfield-NBL-Meteors/281152/ | title=Todd's been snapped up | work=DailyMercury.com.au | date=27 July 2009 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>

==Professional career==
===Townsville Crocodiles (2009<U+2013>2015)===
While he played sparingly in his [[2009<U+2013>10 NBL season|first season]] with the Townsville Crocodiles, Blanchfield did show signs of potential when he got the chance, finishing the season with averages of 1.1 points and 0.7 rebounds in 10 games.<ref name=stats>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxsportspulse.com/team_info.cgi?client=0-189-88242-327335-19755583&sID=&action=PSTATS&pID=190404433 | title=Player statistics for Todd Blanchfield | work=FoxSportsPulse.com | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> Following the Crocodiles' semi-final loss to the [[Wollongong Hawks]], Blanchfield re-joined the Mackay Meteors for the 2010 QBL season<ref>{{cite web | last=Payne | first=Charlie | url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/todd-has-learned-much-in-big-time/477751/ | title=Todd hopes to make NBL final | work=DailyMercury.com.au | date=27 February 2010 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> where in 21 games, he averaged 18.7 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game.

Blanchfield was rewarded on 3 June 2010 with a three-year contract offer from the Crocodiles, signing with the club as a full-time player and realising a lifelong ambition.<ref>{{cite web | last=Payne | first=Charlie | url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/blanchfield-offered-three-year-nbl-deal/549411/ | title=Blanchfield offered NBL deal | work=DailyMercury.com.au | date=4 June 2010 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> In his first [[2010<U+2013>11 NBL season|full season]] with the Crocs, Blanchfield averaged 2.6 points and 1.5 rebounds in 27 games.<ref name="stats" /> His full-time commitment to the Crocodiles coincided with his move to the Townsville Heat for the 2011 QBL season in order to be closer to the club and coaches during the NBL off-season. He was considered the Heat's most consistent player by head coach Liam Flynn and it was evident in his production,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.crocodiles.com.au/article/id/6b9hwdw0isvf1pbxdr2xebcsp | title=Croc Sightings | work=Crocodiles.com.au | publisher=NBL.com.au | date=3 June 2011 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> finishing the season with averages of 18.4 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 18 games, and was named in the QBL All-League team.<ref name=qbl>{{cite web | url=http://www.qabl.basketball.net.au/index.php?id=117 | title=All League Teams | work=qabl.basketball.net.au | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>

After a great season in the QBL and having gotten more stronger and mature, Blanchfield had a very productive season for the Crocs in [[2011<U+2013>12 NBL season|2011<U+2013>12]] playing a back-up role for starting [[small forward]] [[Elvin Mims]]. In 31 games, he averaged 7.2 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.<ref name="stats" /> On 3 May 2012, he signed a two-year contract extension with the club, keeping him under contract until the end of the [[2014<U+2013>15 NBL season|2014<U+2013>15 season]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/todd-blanchfield-townsville-crocodiles-basketball/1367427/ | title=Blanchfield back with the Crocodiles | work=DailyMercury.com.au | date=3 May 2012 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/1fr667t4n2z3q12vml1btfdr0f | title=Blanchfield extends future with Crocs | work=NBL.com.au | date=4 May 2012 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> Playing for the Townsville Heat in 2012, he earned QBL All-League team honours for the second straight year<ref name="qbl" /> after averaging 19.7 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.8 steals in 13 games.

Blanchfield finally cracked the starting small forward spot in [[2012<U+2013>13 NBL season|2012<U+2013>13]] and subsequently set career highs in points, rebounds and field goal percentage. Townsville started the season at 0-10 before defeating the [[Adelaide 36ers]] on 30 November for their first win of the season and Blanchfield's play was the only real bright spark for the Crocs during this time, as he scored double figures in 14 of his first 22 games. However, a late season slump saw him score double digits just once in his last six games. On the season, he averaged 9.4 points and 4.2 rebounds in 28 games.<ref name="stats" /> He returned once again to the Townsville Heat following the NBL season, and in 13 games during the 2013 QBL season, he averaged 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game.

With the decline of Crocs star [[Peter Crawford (basketball)|Peter Crawford]], Blanchfield's role increased once again in [[2013<U+2013>14 NBL season|2013<U+2013>14]] as he scored a career-high 23 points against the [[New Zealand Breakers]] on 18 October. Whilst the Crocs stayed in playoff contention during the first half of the season, a mid-season slump saw them drop out of the top four race. Blanchfield once again put up career highs in points (11.0), rebounds (5.3) and assists (1.5).<ref name="stats" /> On 31 January 2014, the announcement of Blanchfield's return to Mackay for the 2014 season was a welcome one to the club and fans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxsportspulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=0-4812-0-0-0&sID=84225&&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=27922650 | title=Meteors Homecoming For Blanchfield | work=FoxSportsPulse.com | date=31 January 2014 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> Playing for his hometown team again, Blanchfield dominated the league, leading his team to the Grand Final<ref>{{cite web | last=Plane | first=Melanie | url=http://www.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/rockets-are-the-toast-of-qbl-again-grand-final/2370677/ | title=VIDEO: Rockets are the toast of QBL again | work=TheMorningBulletin.com.au | date=1 September 2014 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> and earning all-league honours for a third time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxsportspulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=1-4812-0-0-0&sID=228798 | title=QBL Award Winners | work=FoxSportsPulse.com | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> In 18 games, he averaged 19.3 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.1 steals per game.

Blanchfield improved once again in [[2014<U+2013>15 NBL season|2014<U+2013>15]] as his move to an off-guard position allowed him to carry and control the ball more often on offense. With the departure of both [[Josh Pace]] and Peter Crawford, Blanchfield was the main wing focus for the Crocodiles and it showed with his stellar season averages of 14.6 points and six rebounds per game, while shooting at 44.8% from the field and 34.6% from beyond the arc. He was named Player of the Week twice during the season,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.crocodiles.com.au/article/id/8tcapced7seg14knne9m28kxd | title=R16 Player of the Week: Todd Blanchfield | work=Crocodiles.com.au | publisher=NBL.com.au | date=28 January 2015 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.crocodiles.com.au/article/id/15d3e62ul9cje1mj4tg6ok2sdq | title=R18 Player of the Week: Todd Blanchfield | work=Crocodiles.com.au | publisher=NBL.com.au | date=10 February 2015 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> was awarded the NBL's Most Improved Player,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.crocodiles.com.au/article/id/18sop74z0w48217bf9usbe3x9j | title=NBL Awards: Todd Blanchfield Most Improved | work=Crocodiles.com.au | publisher=NBL.com.au | date=1 March 2015 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> and earned All-NBL second team honours.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nbl.com.au/article/id/sdosmznqddpe1js1gnk67ey2j | title=NBL AWARDS: All-NBL First Team | work=NBL.com.au | date=6 March 2015 | accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>

===Southland Sharks (2015<U+2013>present)===
