[[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] '''Sir Frank Noel Mason-Macfarlane''', [[Order of the Bath|KCB]],<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36121|supp=yes|startpage=3529|date=3 August 1943|accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (23 October 1889, [[Cookham]] - 12 August 1953, [[Twyford, Berkshire|Twyford]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[soldier]], administrator and politician who served as [[Governor of Gibraltar]] during [[World War II]].

==Military career==
'Mason-Mac' joined the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1909 and served in [[World War I]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and in [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]].  He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] and the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=29438|supp=yes|startpage=579|date=14 January 1916|accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref> He served as Britain's [[military attach<U+00E9>]] to [[Berlin]] prior to [[World War II]] (and proposed the [[assassination]] of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], an offer turned down by his superiors)<ref>{{cite book|last=Moorhouse|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Moorhouse|title=Killing Hitler: The Plots, the Assassins, and the Dictator Who Cheated Death|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=uhhoK-s1llgC&pg=PA190|year=2007|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-553-38255-6|pages=190<U+00E2><U+0080><U+0093>92}}</ref> as well as to [[Hungary]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Denmark]]. He was Director of Military Intelligence with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in 1939-1940 and during the retreat to Dunkirk was operational commander of "Mac Force," an improvised formation covering the British right flank.<ref name="Time">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818762,00.html#ixzz0fS9dJcmv ''TIME'' 24 Aug. 1953]</ref>  From July 1940 to March 1941 Mason-Macfarlane was Second in Command of Gibraltar City and Garrison. This position allowed him to head the Joint Intelligence Centre. He was the head of a joint group of Army, Navy and RAF personnel whose job it was to support General Franco if Spain was to be invaded by Germany. They were to assist the Spanish defense if that was what happened and if the Spanish did not resist then they were to create maximum damage.<ref name=crone>{{cite web|last=Crone|first=Jim|title=Joint Intelligence Centre (use index)|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com/pages/mainlogo/mainfrm.htm|publisher=Discover Gibraltar|accessdate=18 June 2013}}</ref>  

He was next Head of the British Military Mission in [[Moscow]], from 1941 until 1942.<ref name=dk>[http://www.generals.dk/general/MacFarlane/Sir_Frank_Noel_Mason-/Great_Britain.html Generals.dk]</ref> He then became [[General Officer Commanding]] [[44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division|44th Division]].<ref name=dk/>

He was [[Governor of Gibraltar]] from 31 May 1942 to 14 February 1944, and witnessed the air crash there on 4 July 1943 which took the life of his friend the [[Poland|Polish]] Prime Minister [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sikorski]]. He later served as Chief Commissioner of the [[Allied Control Commission]] for [[Italy]] in 1944, effectively head of the interim post-war government.<ref name=dk/>

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], Mason-Macfarlane was elected as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Paddington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Paddington North]], defeating [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s close ally [[Brendan Bracken]]. He left parliament on 22 October 1946 by accepting the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]'s appointment as [[Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=37768|startpage=5262|date=25 October 1946|accessdate=2011-02-25}}</ref> This is a procedural device to effect [[resignation from the House of Commons]], since members of the British House of Commons are not permitted to simply resign their seat, but are disbarred by holding an office of profit under [[the Crown]].

It was reported in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on 24 August 1953 that "one of Britain's ablest soldier-administrators" had died of [[arthritis]] and complications from a broken leg.<ref name="Time"/>

Mason-Macfarlane's papers and correspondence are archived in the [[Imperial War Museum]]'s Department of Documents.

==Second Bar to Military Cross==
While attached to Headquarters, 41st Divisional Artillery, he was awarded a second bar to his Military Cross.  The citation reads as follows:
<blockquote>''"While he was engaged on a reconnaissance another officer who was with him was severely wounded by a sniper. He removed him to a place of safety and also brought in a stretcher-bearer who was wounded by the same sniper. He then completed his reconnaissance and returned with valuable and accurate information."<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=31043|supp=yes|startpage=14215|date=2 December 1918|accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref>''</blockquote>
