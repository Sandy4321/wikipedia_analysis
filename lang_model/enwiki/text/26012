==Plot summary==
{{spoiler}}
=== Plot in the Real World ===
The story begins in the year 1199, just before the beginning of the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Young Arthur de Caldicot, thirteen years of age at the time, is the second son of a [[knight]] living in Caldicot manor in the [[England]]/[[Wales]] Middle [[Marches]]. Most of the first book deals with the stresses associated with [[medieval life]], most importantly to Arthur the fact that he is Sir John's second son, and as such is not applicable for inheritance of land. In order to have a life of his own, he must become a [[squire]] and then a [[knight]], and create his own manor and farmland. One obstacle in his way is that his [[yard-skills]] are lacking in some respects, most notably [[jousting]] and [[sword-play]]. This is in no small part due to the fact that he is [[left-handed]], considered a dangerous oddity in those days, and so he must practice with his off-hand. Another obstacle is that he is very good at reading and writing, and so his father is considering making him a [[scribe]], which he does not want to be. These obstacles are removed, however, when, on his fourteenth birthday, he learns that Sir William de Gortanore, another knight, is really his father, and he is placed into the inheritance of a large manor. This starts a subplot dealing with the identity of his mother, as it seems that his mother's husband was murdered by Sir William, who was jealous of him. It also meant the end of the relationship between Arthur and Grace, Sir William's daughter, who were to be [[betrothed]] but now know they cannot, as Grace is Arthur's half-sister. The plot in the world of Arthur de Caldicot ends with Arthur being accepted as squire to Lord Stephen de Holt, the [[lord]] of the Middle Marches.

=== Plot in the Seeing Stone ===
The Seeing Stone, which plays a large part of the plot of the trilogy, is given to Arthur de Caldicot early in the story by [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]), along with the warning that should anyone else be privy to the knowledge of the stone, it will cease to work. Through the stone, the boy Arther is able to observe the life of the mythical [[King Arthur]] and his rise to power as [[King of England]]. Many of the characters look exactly like or very similar to characters in Arthur's own world. The most notable resemblance is that between Arthur and young King Arthur himself, which leads him at first to believe that the Arthur in the stone is actually him in the near future. This belief is accentuated when he finds that, like the young King Arthur, the people he believes to be his parents are actually his [[foster parents]]. Later into the story, it becomes clear that King Arthur inhabits more of a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]], with various events in both worlds reflecting one another. The story of the stone begins with the marriage of [[King Uther]] and Ygerna. They conceive a child, who is named Arthur. Arthur is taken away by Merlin to foster parents. Years later, when King Uther dies, Arthur comes to be king by pulling out [[Sword in the Stone|the sword in the stone]]. His rise to power concludes the plot in the stone for this book.
