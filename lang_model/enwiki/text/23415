The French [[Protestant Reformation|Reformer]] [[John Calvin]] (1509<U+2013>1564) was a theological writer who produced many sermons, biblical commentaries, letters, theological treatises, and other works. Although nearly all of Calvin's adult life was spent in [[Geneva]] (1536-38 and 1541-64), his publications spread his ideas of a properly reformed church to many parts of Europe and from there to the rest of the world. It is especially on account of his voluminous publications that he exerts such a lasting influence over Christianity and Western history.

Calvin's first published work was an [[edition]] of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''De Clementia'', accompanied by a commentary demonstrating a thorough knowledge of antiquity. His first theological work, the ''Psychopannychia'', attempted to refute the doctrine of [[soul sleep]] as promulgated by Christians whom Calvin called "[[Anabaptists]]." He finished it in 1534 but, on the advice of friends, didn't publish it until 1542. The work demonstrates that since his conversion, Calvin had undertaken serious study and now showed a mastery of the [[Bible]], and he had become, using [[Karl Barth]]'s words, a "theological Humanist" and a "biblicist" &mdash; that is, "no matter how true a teaching might be, he was not ready to lend an ear to it apart from the Word of God."<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Karl Barth]] | title = The Theology of John Calvin | publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co | location = Grand Rapids | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780802806963 }}</ref>

At the age of twenty-six, Calvin published the first edition of his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (Latin title: ''Institutio Christianae Religionis''), a seminal work in Christian theology that is still read by theological students today.<ref name="131Christians">[http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/special/131christians/calvin.html "John Calvin"] from "131 Christians everyone should know" in ''Christian History & Biography''</ref> It was published in Latin in 1536 and in his native French in 1541, with the definitive editions appearing in 1559 (Latin) and in 1560 (French). The book was written as an introductory textbook on the Protestant faith for those with some learning already and covered a broad range of theological topics from the doctrines of [[Christian Church|church]] and [[sacraments]] to [[sola fide|justification by faith alone]] and [[Christian liberty]], and it vigorously attacked the teachings of those Calvin considered [[orthodoxy|unorthodox]], particularly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to which Calvin says he had been "strongly devoted" before his conversion to Protestantism. The over-arching theme of the book &ndash; and Calvin's greatest theological legacy &ndash; is the idea of God's total sovereignty, particularly in [[salvation]] and election.<ref name="131Christians"/> 

Calvin also produced many volumes of commentary on most of the books of the Bible. For the [[Old Testament]], he published commentaries for all books except the histories after [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] (though he did publish his [[sermons]] on [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]]) and the Wisdom literature other than the [[Book of Psalms]]. For the [[New Testament]], he omitted only the brief [[Second Epistle of John|second]] and [[Third Epistle of John|third]] [[Epistles of John]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. These commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years.

Calvin also wrote more than 1,300 letters on a wide range of topics.

Calvin developed his theology, the most enduring component of his thought, in his biblical commentaries as well as his sermons and treatises, and he gave the most concise expression of his views on Christian theology in his ''magnum opus'', the ''Institutes of the Christian Religion''.<ref>See:

==Commentaries==
Calvin produced commentaries on most of the books of the Bible. His first commentary on [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] was published in 1540, and he planned to write commentaries on the entire [[New Testament]]. However, it took six years before he wrote his second, a commentary on [[I Corinthians]]. He did not lose any more time in reaching his goal. Within four years he had published commentaries on all the [[Pauline epistles]], and he also revised the commentary on Romans. He then turned his attention on the [[general epistles]], dedicating them to [[Edward VI of England]]. By 1555 he had completed his work on the New Testament, finishing with the [[Acts]] and the [[Gospels]] (he did omit only the brief [[Second_Epistle_of_John|second]] and [[Third_Epistle_of_John|third]] [[Epistles of John]]  and the [[Book of Revelation]]). 

For the [[Old Testament]], he wrote commentaries on [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], the books of the [[Pentateuch]], the [[Psalms]], and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]]. The material for the commentaries often originated from lectures to students and ministers that he would re-work for publication. However, from 1557 onwards, he could not find the time to continue this method, and he gave permission for his lectures to be published from stenographers' notes. These ''Praelectiones'' covered the [[minor prophets]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]], and part of [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]].<ref>See:
*De Greef (2004), pp. 44<U+2013>45.
*Parker (2006), pp. 134<U+2013>136, 160<U+2013>162.</ref>

In the controversial matter of interpreting [[prophecy]] such as that in the Book of Daniel, Calvin advocated a [[preterism|preterist]] view in his commentaries, which is to say that he believed most prophecies had already been fulfilled in history. In this view he was essentially in line with the [[early church]] and the Reformers who came before him, but he is in distinction to many of his immediate successors who took a [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|historicist]] view and to many today who look a [[Futurism (Christian eschatology)|future fulfillment]].<ref>{{cite book| author=John Calvin |title=Commentary on Daniel, Volume 1 |chapter=Translator's Preface: The Praeterist, Anti-Papal, and Futurist Views |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom24.ii.html#ii-p90 |others=Thomas Meyers (trans.) |date=1852 |origdate=1561 |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

[[The Netherlands|Dutch]] theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]], after whom the anti-Calvinistic movement [[Arminianism]] was named, says with regard to the value of Calvin's writings:<ref name="Tributes">{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc8.iv.viii.iv.html |chapter=Tributes to the Memory of Calvin |author=Philip Schaff |title=History of the Christian Church |volume=VIII |date=1892 |accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

:Next to the study of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin<U+2019>s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 1551&ndash;1608); for I affirm that he excels beyond comparison in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued than all that is handed down to us by the library of the [[Church father|fathers]]; so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of [[prophecy]]. His ''Institutes'' ought to be studied after the [[Catechism#Heidelberg Catechism|(Heidelberg) Catechism]], as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men.

These commentaries, too, have proved to be of lasting value to students of the Bible, and they are still in print after over 400 years.

==Letters==
[[Image:John Calvin's handwriting 01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Letter of Calvin to king [[Edward VI of England]], [[July 4]], [[1552]] - [[British Museum]]]]
Calvin's body of letters has not received the wide readership of the ''Institutes'' and bible commentaries since his correspondence obviously addressed the particular needs and occasions of his day. Even so, the scale of his letter writing was just as prodigious as his better-known works: his letters number some 1,300, and, along with some 3,000 letters written to him, fill eleven of Calvin's fifty-nine volumes in the ''[[Corpus Reformatorum]]''.<ref>*{{Citation | last = De Greef | first = Wulfert | title =The Writings of John Calvin: An Introductory Guide | publisher =Westminster John Knox Press | year =2008 | place = Louisville, Kentucky| isbn = 0664232302 |page=197}}</ref> [[B. B. Warfield]] calls Calvin "the great letter-writer of the Reformation age."<ref>B.B. Warfield, ''Calvin and Augustine''. The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA, 1956. p. 14. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 56-7349.</ref>

His letters, often written under the [[pseudonym]] Charles d'Espeville,<ref>{{cite_book|chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc8.iv.xvi.html |title=History of the Christian Church |date=1892 |volume=VIII |chapter=Servetus: His Life, Opinions, Trial, and Execution |author=Philip Schaff |accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> concern issues ranging from disputes about local theater<ref>[http://www.leedstrinity.ac.uk/histcourse/reformat/geneva/theagene.htm "06.56 Theatre in Geneva"]</ref> to raising support for fledgling churches<ref>[http://www.leedstrinity.ac.uk/histcourse/reformat/geneva/calvlet1.htm "06.42 Calvin to Guillaume Farel, 30 December 1553"]</ref> to choosing sides in a political alliance.<ref name="Letters">Jules Bonnet, ''Letters of John Calvin''. Translated by David Constable, 4 volumes. Thomas Constable and Co., Edinburgh, U.K. vol. II, p. 212; vol. I, p. 436n; vol. I, pp. 434-435.</ref> They also reveal personal qualities that are not evident in his exegetical prose. One example came after the massacre of the [[Waldensians]] of [[Provence]] in 1545 where 3,600 were slaughtered. Calvin was so dismayed that in a space of twenty-one days he visited Berne, Aurich, Schaffhausen, Basle, and Strasbourg, before addressing the deputies of the Cantons at the Diet of Arau, pleading everywhere for an intercession on behalf of those who survived.<ref name="Letters"/> He wrote of his grief to [[William Farel]]:

:Such was the savage cruelty of the persecutors, that neither young girls, nor pregnant women, nor infants were spared. So great is the atrocious cruelty of this proceeding, that I grow bewildered when I reflect upon it. How, then, shall I express it in words? &nbsp;... I write, worn out with sadness, and not without tears, which so burst forth, that every now and then they interrupt my words.<ref name="Letters"/>

One of Calvin's better known letters was his reply to [[Jacopo Sadoleto]]'s "Letter to the Genevans,"<ref>Both letters can be found in [http://books.google.com/books?vid=00aHMHYuRrGTfBEk&id=6iMBAAAAQAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22tracts+relating+to+the+reformation%22#PPP6,M1 ''Calvin's Tracts Relating to the Reformation''], translated by H. Beveridge, 1844. Digitized by [[Google Books]]</ref> and this "Reformation Debate" remains in print today.
