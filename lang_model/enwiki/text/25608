She was 43.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Eleanor Marx was born in [[London]] on 16 January 1855, the sixth child and fourth daughter<ref name=Brodie>Brodie, Fran: [http://www.workersliberty.org/node/7356 Eleanor Marx] in ''Workers' Liberty''. Retrieved April 23, 2007.</ref> of Marx and his wife [[Jenny von Westphalen]]. She was called "Tussy" from a young age. She showed an early interest in politics, even writing to political figures during her childhood.<ref name=EoM>[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/people/m/a.htm#marx-eleanor Marx Family] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Marxism]]. Retrieved April 23, 2007.''</ref> The hanging of the ''[[Manchester Martyrs]]'' when she was twelve, for example, horrified her and shaped her lifelong sympathy for the [[Fenian]]s.<ref name=Brodie/> Her father's story-telling also inspired an interest in literature in her, she could recite passages by [[William Shakespeare]] at the age of three.<ref name=SE>[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wmarx.htm Eleanor Marx] in ''[[Spartacus Educational]]''. Retrieved April 23, 2007.</ref> By her teenage years this love of Shakespeare led to the formation of the 'Dogberry Club' at which she, her family and the family of [[Clara Collet]],<ref>McDonald, Deborah, ''Clara Collet 1860-1948: An Educated Working Woman'' (London Woburn Press 2004</ref> all recited Shakespeare whilst her father watched.

At the age of sixteen, Eleanor became her father's [[secretary]] and accompanied him around the world to socialist conferences.<ref name=SE/> A year later, she fell in love with [[Hippolyte Lissagaray]], a journalist and member of the [[Paris Commune]], who had fled to London after the Commune's suppression.<ref name=Brodie/> Although he agreed with the man politically, Karl Marx disapproved of the relationship because of the age gap between the two, Lissagaray being 34 years old. Eleanor then moved away from home to [[Brighton]] working as a [[schoolteacher]]; she lived at [[Vernon Terrace, Brighton|6 Vernon Terrace]] in the [[Montpelier, Brighton|Montpelier]] suburb.<ref name="NEB75">{{Cite book|last=Collis|first=Rose|others=(based on the original by Tim Carder)|title=The New Encyclopaedia of Brighton|edition=1st|year=2010|publisher=Brighton & Hove Libraries|location=Brighton|isbn=978-0-9564664-0-2|page=75}}</ref>

A year later she helped Lissagaray write ''History of the Commune of 1871'', and translated it into English. Her father liked the book but was still disapproving of his daughter's relationship with its author. By 1880 Karl changed his view of the situation, allowing her to marry him. However, by then Eleanor herself was having second thoughts. She terminated the relationship in 1882.<ref name=SE/>

In the early 1880s, she had to nurse her aging parents, but her mother died in December 1881. Her elder sister, [[Jenny Longuet]], died in January 1883, of bladder cancer, and her father died in March 1883. Before his death, her father gave her the task of taking care of the publication of his unfinished manuscripts and the [[English language]] version of his main work, ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]''.<ref name=SE/>

===Political career===
In 1884, Eleanor joined the [[Social Democratic Federation]] (SDF) led by [[Henry Hyndman]] and was elected to its executive. During her work in the SDF, she met [[Edward Aveling]], with whom she would spend the rest of her life. In the same year, a split of the organisation led her to leave it and found the rival [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]]. The split had two root causes: personality problems, as Hyndman was accused of leading the SDF in a dictatorial fashion,<ref name=SE/> and disagreements on the issue of internationalism. In this point Hyndman was accused by Marx among others of nationalist tendencies. He was, for example, opposed to Marx's idea of sending delegates to the [[French Workers' Party]] calling the proposal a "family manoeuvre", since Eleanor Marx' sister [[Laura Marx|Laura]] and her husband [[Paul Lafargue]] were members of that party. Therefore, both Marx and Aveling became founding members of the Socialist League, whose most prominent member was [[William Morris]].<ref name=Brodie/>

Marx regularly wrote a regular column called "Record of the Revolutionary International Movement" for the Socialist League's monthly newspaper, ''[[Commonweal (United Kingdom)|Commonweal]].''<ref>Yvonne Kapp, ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2.'' New York: Pantheon Books, 1976; pg. 66.</ref>

In 1884, Marx also met [[Clementina Black]], a painter and trade unionist, and became involved in the [[Women's Trade Union League]]. She would go on to support numerous [[Strike action|strike]]s including the [[Bryant & May strike]] of 1888 and the [[London Dock Strike of 1889]]. She helped organise the [[GMB Union|Gasworkers' Union]] and wrote numerous books and articles.<ref name=SE/>

In 1885, she helped organize the International Socialist Congress in [[Paris]].<ref name=SE/> The following year, she toured the United States along with Aveling and the German socialist [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]], raising money for the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].<ref name=EoM/>

By the late 1880s, the Socialist League was deeply divided between those advocating political action and its opponents <U+2014> who were themselves split between those like William Morris who felt that parliamentary campaigns represented inevitable compromises and corruptions, and an [[anarchism|anarchist]] wing which opposed all electoral politics as a matter of principle. Marx and Aveling, as firm advocates of the principle of participation in political campaigns, found themselves in an uncomfortable minority in the party. At the 4th Annual Conference of the Socialist League the Bloomsbury branch, to which Marx and Aveling belonged, moved that a meeting of all socialist bodies should be called to discuss the formation of a united organisation. This resolution was voted down by a substantial margin, as was another put forward by the same branch in support of contesting seats in both local and parliamentary elections. Moreover, the Socialist League at this occasion suspended the 80 members of the Bloomsbury branch on the grounds that the group had put up candidates jointly with the SDF, against the policy of the party. The Bloomsbury branch thus exited the Socialist League for a new, albeit brief, independent existence as the [[Bloomsbury Socialist Society]].<ref>Kapp, ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2,'' pp. 264-265.</ref>

In 1893, [[Keir Hardie]] founded the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP), Marx attended the founding conference as an observer, while Aveling was a delegate. Their goal of shifting the ILP's positions towards Marxism failed, however, as the party remained under a strong [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] influence. In 1897, Marx and Aveling re-joined the Social Democratic Federation, like most former members of the Socialist League.<ref name=Brodie/>

===Involvement in theatre===
In the 1880s, Eleanor Marx became more interested in theatre and took up acting. She believed in the art as a socialist and feminist tool.<ref name=SE/> She also translated various literary works, including the first English translation of [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]''. She also translated [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'' and ''[[An Enemy of the People]]''.<ref>[http://gfdl.marxists.org.uk/archive/eleanor-marx/index.htm Eleanor Marx bibliography] on marxists.org. Retrieved April 23, 2007.</ref> In 1886, she performed a groundbreaking if critically unsuccessful reading of Ibsen's ''[[A Doll's House]]'' in London, with herself as Nora Helmer, Aveling as Torvald Helmer, and [[George Bernard Shaw]] as Krogstad.<ref name=Florence>Ronald Florence, ''Marx's Daughters'', New York: Dial Press, 1975</ref>

===Death and legacy===
In 1898, Eleanor discovered that the ailing Edward Aveling had secretly married a young actress, to whom he remained committed. Aveling's illness seemed to her to be terminal, and Eleanor was deeply depressed by the faithlessness of the man she loved.

On 31 March 1898, Eleanor sent the maid to the local [[chemist]] with a note to which she signed the initials of the man the chemist knew as "Dr Aveling," asking for [[padiorium]] and a small quantity of [[Hydrogen cyanide|prussic acid]] (hydrogen cyanide) for her dog."<ref>Kapp, ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2,'' pg. 696.</ref><ref>Matthew Gwyther: ''[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/property/4810864/Inside-story-7-Jews-Walk.html Inside story: 7 Jew's Walk].'' In: ''[[The Daily Telegraph]].'' 23 September 2000</ref> Eleanor received the chemicals and sent the maid back to the chemists to return a receipt book sent with the drugs. She then retired to her room, wrote two brief suicide notes, undressed, got into bed, and swallowed the poison.<ref name="Kapp, pp. 696-697">Kapp, ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2,'' pp. 696-697.</ref>

The maid discovered Eleanor in bed, scarcely breathing, when she returned. A doctor was called for but Eleanor had died by the time he arrived. She was 43. A ''post mortem'' examination determined the cause of death to be poisoning by [[padiorium]].<ref name="Kapp, pp. 696-697"/> A subsequent inquest cleared Aveling of criminal wrongdoing, but he was widely reviled throughout the socialist community as having caused Eleanor to take her life.

A funeral was held on 5 April 1898, attended by a large throng of mourners. Speeches were made by Aveling, [[Robert Banner (socialist)|Robert Banner]], [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Pete Curran]], Henry Hyndman, and [[Will Thorne]]. Following the memorial, Eleanor Marx's body was taken to [[Woking Crematorium|Woking]] and [[cremation|cremated]].<ref>Kapp, ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2,'' pp. 702-703.</ref> An urn containing her ashes was subsequently kept safe by a succession of left wing organizations, including the Social Democratic Federation, the [[British Socialist Party]], and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], before finally being buried alongside the remains of Karl Marx and other family members at [[Highgate Cemetery]] in London in 1956.<ref>Kapp, ''Eleanor Marx: Volume 2,'' pp. 703-704.</ref>

On 9 September 2008 an English Heritage [[blue plaque]] was placed on the house on Jews Walk, [[Sydenham]], south-east London, where Eleanor spent the last few years of her life.<ref name=blueplaque>{{cite web |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/marx-eleanor-1855-1898 |title=Marx, Eleanor (1855-1898)}}</ref>
