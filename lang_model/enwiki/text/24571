'''''The Frighteners''''' is a 1996 [[comedy horror]] film directed by [[Peter Jackson]] and co-written with his wife, [[Fran Walsh]]. The film's cast includes 
[[Michael J. Fox]], [[Trini Alvarado]], [[John Astin]], [[Jeffrey Combs]], [[Dee Wallace-Stone]], [[Jake Busey]] and [[Chi McBride]]. ''The Frighteners'' tells the story of Frank Bannister, an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating money out of customers for his "ghosthunting" business. However, a [[mass murder]]er comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence.

Jackson and Walsh conceived the idea for ''The Frighteners'' during the scriptwriting phase of ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''. [[Robert Zemeckis]] hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing ''The Frighteners'' as a [[spin-off]] film of the television series, ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]''. With Jackson and Walsh's first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film would be better off directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]. The visual effects were created by Jackson's [[Weta Digital]], who had only been in existence for three years. This, plus the fact that ''The Frighteners'' required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.

Despite a rushed [[post-production]] schedule, Universal Pictures was so impressed with Jackson's [[rough cut]] on ''The Frighteners'', the studio moved the theatrical release date closer by four months. The film was not a [[box office]] success, but ''Frighteners'' received generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
''The Frighteners'' starts with a panicked woman named Patricia Bradley running from a [[Grim Reaper]]-like ghost seen through the shape of walls. She is saved when her elderly mother shoots at the ghost. Meanwhile, years ago, architect Frank Bannister loses his wife in a car accident and gives up his profession, letting his unfinished "dream house" sit incomplete for years. Following his wife's death, Bannister gains the power to see ghosts and puts this skill to use by befriending three ghosts named Cyrus (a 1970s individual), Stuart (a nerd, presumably from the 1950s) and The Judge (an Old West [[gunslinger]]). Cyrus, Stuart and Judge help Bannister by haunting houses in the area to accumulate work for Bannister's ghostbusting business; Frank then proceeds to "exorcise" the houses for a fee (one of these houses is that of Dr. Lucy Lynskey and her husband). However, Bannister is depicted by locals as a [[confidence trick|conman]]. He discovers that the husband of Lucy Lynskey has been killed and an encounter with his ghost leads him to discover that an entity resembling the Grim Reaper is killing people, and marking numbers on their forehead.

Frank tries to help the people whom the Reaper is after with his motivation being that his wife was found dead after the car crash with a similar (lower) number carved into her forehead. Because Frank can see the numbers ahead of time, he can foretell the murders, but this puts him under suspicion by the police and Milton Dammers, an eccentric FBI agent. Frank is eventually arrested for the death of a person he was trying to save. Lucy pays Frank a visit in prison, and seeing that Lucy is the reaper's next target, Frank attempts to prevent her death and escapes from prison with the help of Cyrus and Stuart. Frustrated by his inability to fight the reaper, Frank attempts to kill himself so he can stop the reaper's killing spree. However, Lucy convinces Bannister to instead go to the local freezing works.

Frank confronts the Reaper and discovers that the killer is the ghost of Johnny Charles Bartlett. In life, Bartlett was crazy about being a prolific serial killer and murdered twelve people in a [[psychiatric hospital]] with the assistance of Patricia Bradley, Bartlett's underaged girlfriend and daughter of the Director of the Hospital. The two were arrested and tried: Patricia was sent to prison on suspicion despite maintaining her innocence, but released to live with her overbearing mother under careful observation, while Bartlett received the [[electric chair]]. Using Barlett's [[scythe]] against him, Frank rids Johnny of his Reaper form, but before he can do anything else, he is forced back into his body.

After learning the identity of the Reaper, Lucy worries that Patricia will become one of Johnny's targets. She enters the house and makes a terrifying discovery: Patricia is still communicating with Bartlett's ghost. Patricia then kills her mother and tries to kill Lucy, but Frank saves her and the two flee, stealing Bartlett's ashes from Patricia's room. Hoping to take the ashes to holy ground, they run for the chapel of an abandoned hospital to send Bartlett to [[Hell]]. Frank's realizes that this was the hospital where the original crimes were committed, but the ashes are thrown away by Dammers (whose  is subsequently blasted with a shotgun by Patricia). Bartlett and Patricia hunt down Frank and Lucy. It is then that Frank makes sense of his repressed memories about the car crash that killed his wife. Bartlett, it seems, drove the two off the road and killed Frank's wife, Debra, then Patricia used Frank's [[utility knife]] to cut the number into her forehead. The two kill Frank by strangling him, however, Frank's ghost seizes Patricia's spirit and drags her up towards Heaven with him, with Bartlett in hot pursuit. When they arrive, both Bartlett and Patricia are sent down to Hell, while Frank, after meeting Debra's spirit (as well as Cyrus and Stuart), is told it is not yet his time and is sent back to earth. Frank and Lucy fall in love, and due to the traumatic experience the two went through, Lucy can see the ghosts too. Frank goes back to being an architect, demolishing the dream house that he never finished for his wife and building a new life with Lucy.

==Development==
===Production===
[[Peter Jackson]] and wife/co-writer [[Fran Walsh]] conceived the idea for ''The Frighteners'' in 1992, during the scriptwriting phase of ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]''.<ref name=Bob/> Together, they wrote a three-page [[film treatment]] and sent it off their [[talent agent]] in Hollywood. [[Robert Zemeckis]] viewed their treatment with the intention of directing ''The Frighteners'' as a [[spin-off]] film of the television series, ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (which he helped produce).<ref name=blood>{{cite news | author = Helms, Michael | title = The Frighteners | work = [[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]] | date = July 1996 | pages = 35-41 | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}</ref><ref name=better/> Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993.<ref name=biography>{{cite book | author= [[Brian Sibley|Sibley, Brian]] | title = Peter Jackson: A Film-maker's Journey | publisher =[[HarperCollins]] | year =2006 | isbn = 0-00-717558-2 | location = London | pages= 261, 303 - 322, 331 - 333}}</ref> The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for ''The Frighteners'' in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided ''The Frighteners'' would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref name=better>Sibley, p.273-279</ref> Universal [[greenlight]]ed the film to commence [[pre-production]] on a $26 million budget in April 1994.<ref name=Bob>Pryor, p.191-195</ref><ref name=market>Sibley, p.330-339</ref> The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total [[artistic control]] and the right of [[final cut privilege]].<ref name=blood/>

The decision to film ''The Frighteners'' entirely in New Zealand was Jackson's idea.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd|Archerd, Amy]] | title = Cates thinks diverse noms make for good TV | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862643 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1995-02-15 | accessdate = 2008-12-24}}</ref> Zemeckis and Universal agreed on the condition that Jackson made New Zealand look similar to the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name=camp/> [[Principal photography]] began on May 14, 1995 and lasted until November 16, which is one of the longest [[shooting schedule]]s Universal Pictures ever approved of. Six weeks into the shoot, [[cinematographer]] [[Alun Bollinger]] had a serious car accident. His replacement, John Blick, later alternated duties with Bollinger for much of the rest of the shoot.<ref name=long>Pryor, p.201-203</ref> [[Location shooting]] primarily included [[Wellington]] and three weeks spent in [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]]. Interior scenes were compiled at Camperdown Studios in [[Miramar, New Zealand|Miramar]].<ref name=camp>Pryor, p.196-200</ref>

===Visual effects===
Jackson's [[Weta Digital]] created the visual effects, which included [[computer-generated imagery]], as well as [[scale model]]s (which were necessary to make [[Wellington]] look American),<ref name=biography/> [[prosthetic makeup]] and practical effects with help from [[Weta Workshop]]. [[Visual effects supervisor]] [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] explained that effects work on ''The Frighteners'' was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with [[physical effects]]. With so many ghosts among its main cast, ''The Frighteners'' required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company that had been in existence less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing ''The Frighteners'' was largely stressful.<ref name=long/> Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of which's employees would eventually join Weta Digital.<ref name=biography/> [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]] was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by [[John Astin]] (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker was not able to apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''.<ref name=long/> Makeup artist Brian Penikas ([[Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' trilogy]], ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'') fulfilled Baker's duties.<ref name=Indy>{{cite news | author = Vaz, Mark Cota | title = ''The Frighteners'': The Thrill of the Haunt | work = [[Cinefex]] | date = June 1996 | pages = 67-71 | accessdate = 2008-12-27}}</ref>

The extended shooting schedule for ''The Frighteners'' owed much to the fact that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a [[chroma key|blue screen]]. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of [[Split screen (filmmaking)|split screen photography]]. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air.<ref name=long/> The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], which went through many transformations before finding physical form.<ref name=Indy/> "We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a rod [[puppet]], maybe shooting it in a water tank," Jackson commented. "We even thought of filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds."<ref name=long/> Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using [[computer animation]] would be the easiest task. Another entirely computerized character called "the Gatekeeper", a winged [[cherub]] who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the [[final cut privilege|final cut]].<ref name=Japan>Sibley, p.320-329</ref>

With digital effects work running behind schedule, producer [[Robert Zemeckis]] convinced Wes Takahashi (from [[George Lucas]]' [[Industrial Light & Magic]]) to help work on ''The Frighteners''.<ref name=Japan/> "The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable," Takahashi reflected, "but there were still about 400 shots to do, and everyone was kind of worried."<ref name=stress/> Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor, and began looking at the schedule, trying to work out whether ''The Frighteners'' could be finished in time. "There was no way we'd make the deadline. I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money."<ref name=stress/> The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States, but Jackson, for whom the film was a chance to show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood, convinced Universal otherwise.<ref name=stress/> Instead, ''The Frighteners'' received an accelerated release date, four months earlier than planned, and an additional $6 million in financing, with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations (some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US).<ref>Pryor, p.300-309</ref>

==Release==
The original release date was October 31, 1996, but after Universal [[studio executive]]s viewed a [[rough cut]] of ''The Frighteners'', they were impressed enough to move the release date to their "summer [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] slot" on July 19, 1996.<ref name=shop>{{cite news | author = [[Anne Thompson|Thompson, Anne]] | title = Little Shop of Horror | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293602,00.html | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1996-08-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-24}}</ref> In addition, Universal offered the filmmaker the opportunity to make ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', which was not released until 2005.<ref>Sibley, p.210-319</ref> Jackson often disputed over the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) over the film's rating. Aware that he was meant to be delivering Universal a PG-13 rating, Jackson tried his best to omit the amount of [[graphic violence]] as much as possible, but the MPAA still believed ''The Frighteners'' deserved an R-rating.<ref name=fright>Pryor, p.206-211</ref>

===Box office performance===
''The Frighteners'' was released in the United States in 1,675 theaters, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend.

And I just thought how the hell do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!'" Jackson acknowledged ''The Frighteners''{{'}} tone made it hard to piegonhole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing a film.<ref name=biography/>
