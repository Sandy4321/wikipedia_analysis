The '''AMX-13''' was a [[France|French]]  [[light tank]] produced from 1953 to 1985. It served with the French Army and was exported to over twenty-five other nations. Including prototypes and export versions there are over a hundred variants including [[self-propelled gun]], [[anti-aircraft]] systems, [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s, and [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]/[[ATGM]] versions. It is estimated that total production of the AMX-13 family was 7,700 units, of which around 3,400 were exported.

==History==
The tank was designed at the Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1946 to meet a requirement for an air-portable vehicle to support paratroopers, the first prototype ran from 1948. The compact [[chassis]] had [[torsion bar suspension]] with five roadwheels and two return rollers; the engine runs the length of the tank on the right side with the driver on the left. The uncommon two-part 'oscillating' turret is set to the rear of the vehicle and holds the commander and gunner. The original 75 mm gun, modelled on the German L/71 Panther gun, was fed with an automatic loading system in two six-round magazines. A weakness of the small size meant the magazines were mounted externally, thus requiring them to be reloaded ''outside'' the vehicle.

Production began at ARE (Atelier de Construction Roanne) from 1952, with the first tanks delivered the following year. In 1964 production was transferred to Creusot-Loire at Chalon-sur-Saone, as the ARE moved to building the [[AMX 30]] [[main battle tank|MBT]], and the numbers produced declined significantly.

In 1966 the standard gun was increased to 90 mm (the AMX-13/90) and the French upgraded all existing base models to this specification. Although there were many variants on the turret the basic chassis was almost unchnaged until 1985 when changes including a new [[diesel engine]], fully [[automatic transmission]] and a new hydropneumatic [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] were introduced. 

Production halted with the Model 1987. After sales support and upgrades are still offered through [[GIAT Industries]].

The AMX-13 tank was phased out of service with the French Army in the 1970s. Current French light tanks are the [[ERC 90 Sagaie]] and the [[AMX 10 RC]].
