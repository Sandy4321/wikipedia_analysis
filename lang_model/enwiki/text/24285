The '''Red River Flood of 1997 in the United States''' was a major [[flood]] that occurred in April 1997, along the [[Red River of the North]] in [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]]. The flood reached throughout the [[Red River Valley]], affecting the cities of [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] and [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], while [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] and [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota|East Grand Forks]] received the most damage, where floodwaters reached over 3 miles (5 km) inland, inundating virtually everything in the twin communities. Total damages for the Red River region were [[United States dollar|US$]]3.5 billion in damages.

The flood was the result of abundant snowfall and extreme temperatures. Although river levels in Fargo reached record heights, the city was protected by several [[dike (construction)|dikes]] and received minimal damage. In Grand Forks, however, the river crested at 54 feet, surpassing the 49-foot estimate of flooding set by the [[National Weather Service]]. Within East Grand Forks, all but eight homes were destroyed by floodwaters. Grand Forks mayor [[Pat Owens]] had to order the evacuation of over 50,000 people as a large portion of the city would eventually be flooded. A large fire started in Grand Forks, engulfing eleven buildings and sixty apartment units before being extinguished.

Those affected by the flood received donations from across the nation, along with billions in federal aid. City officials and flood-forecasters were criticized for the difference in estimates and actual flood levels. Fargo, Grand Forks, and East Grand Forks built new dikes to prevent damages from future floods and the Greater Grand Forks area began to rebuild around the river, developing a [[Red River State Recreation Area|campground recreation area]], [[Greater Grand Forks Greenway|park]], and shopping districts where homes once stood.

==Red River and prior floods==
[[Image:Redrivernorthmap.png|right|200px|thumb|The Red River of the North]]{{main|Red River of the North}}
The Red River forms the border between [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]]. A few sets of "sister cities" sit directly on this border, including [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]] and its counterpart [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota]], [[Fargo, North Dakota]]/[[Moorhead, Minnesota]] ([[Fargo-Moorhead]]), and [[Wahpeton, North Dakota]]/[[Breckenridge, Minnesota]]. The Red River in Manitoba and the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota has flooded repeatedly through the centuries, endangering lives and property. The river is highly prone to flooding because of its northward flow. As spring approaches, the snow is melted from south to north alongside the riverflow. There is also the possibility that the surplus water can hit unmelted ice on the river and back up. The flatness of the terrain and small slope of the river is a significant factor.

The first known recorded accounts of floods along the Red River appeared in the 1770s. Severe floods occurred throughout the 1800s and 1900s, with one of the most recent major floods occurring in 1979.<ref name="HistoryFloods">{{cite web|title=A History of Flooding in the Red River Basin|publisher=USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/2007/55/pdf/finalWebGIP55.pdf|accessdate=October 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Homes not damaged in that flood were incorrectly assumed to be safe from a future flood.

==Origins==
[[Image:1997snow.JPG|right|200px|thumb|A snow bank in south Grand Forks with a mailbox showing halfway up the bank.  Taken in March of 1997]]There were five main factors that contributed to the flood's severity:<ref>Shelby, p. 4</ref>
*Rainstorms in autumn of 1996 had saturated the ground so that it could not absorb much water.
*There was abundant snowfall during the 1996-1997 winter. A total of 98.6 inches (250 cm) of seasonal snow accumulations in [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] and 117 inches (297 cm) upstream in [[Fargo-Moorhead]] along with other record snowfall events covered the [[Red River of the North]]'s [[watershed]].<ref>Jacobs, p. 12</ref><ref name="Climate1">{{cite web|title=climate.umn.edu|work=Famous Minnesota Winter Storms| url=http://climate.umn.edu/doc/historical/winter_storms.htm|accessdate=September 17| accessyear=2007}}</ref>
*Abnormally cold temperatures plagued the Upper Midwest during this particular winter.  Between [[November 7]], [[1996]] and [[March 18]], [[1997]] (a span of 131 days) the air temperature only reached 40 degrees 3 times in Grand Forks.<ref name="WeatherU">{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KGFK/1996/11/6/CustomHistory.html?dayend=18&monthend=3&yearend=1997&req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA|work=Weather Underground|title=History for Grand Forks, ND|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Because there were only a few days above freezing, there was very little gradual melting of the snow that fell throughout the winter. Starting on [[March 19]], [[1997]] the temperature then rose above freezing for 27 consecutive days, and only eight days after that would the temperature remain below freezing.<ref name="WeatherU2">{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KGFK/1997/3/1/MonthlyHistory.html?req_city=NA&req_state=NA&req_statename=NA|work=Weather Underground|title=History for Grand Forks, ND|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> However, due to the sudden warmth in April, it melted the deep snowpack too quickly for the river to handle.
*A freak [[blizzard]] (unofficially named "Hannah" by the ''Grand Forks Herald'') had dumped a large amount of [[freezing rain]] and snow on the Grand Forks-East Grand Forks area on the weekend of [[April 5]], [[1997]].<ref>The blizzard also killed one man and 10,000 cattle, 1,255 hogs, 3,422 sheep, and 1,000 chickens and turkeys across North Dakota. Shelby, p. 42 & 47</ref>
*Tributary peak flows tended to coincide with those on the Red River itself.

==Preparations==
The first flood outlook was issued on [[February 13]], [[1997]] by the [[National Weather Service]], declaring that there was "...a high spring snowmelt flood potential for the tributaries to the Red River, and a severe spring snowmelt potential for the Red River from Wahpeton, North Dakota to the Canadian border."<ref>Shelby, p. 8</ref> On February 27, a flood planning meeting in [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] revealed that Fargo, [[Wahpeton, North Dakota|Wahpeton]], and Grand Forks would see the Red River rise to 38, 17.9, and 49 feet, respectively.<ref>Shelby, p. 10</ref> The Corps of Engineers recommended on March 24 that Grand Forks' engineers build dikes to a height of 52 feet, which would provide three feet of leeway for the 49-foot estimate.<ref>Shelby, p. 18</ref> Additionally, [[FEMA]] publicly encouraged Grand Forks residents to purchase flood insurance, but only a thousand of the 52,000 residents did so.<ref>Shelby, p. 48</ref><ref name="TimeArticle">{{cite news|last=Lopez|first=Steve|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986275,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|title=THE CITY THAT WOULDN'T DROWN|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Later, researchers at the [[University of North Dakota]] determined that although more than 90% of residents knew about the option of purchasing flood insurance, only a small percentage purchased it since they believed the [[National Weather Service]] had projected that the river would not crest high enough to warrant a flood.<ref>Shelby, p. 111</ref>

[[Image:Grand Forks flood 1997.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Volunteers pile sandbags on April 17]]
On March 31, the [[North Dakota National Guard]] used helicopters to dump sand on ice covering the Red River in an attempt to use the sun's thermal energy to thaw the ice and prevent ice jams.<ref>Jacobs, p. 16</ref> The "dusting" was the most extensive attempt in North Dakota's history.<ref>Shelby, p. 20</ref> Starting on April 3 and continuing everyday<ref>Except for three days starting on April 4 when Blizzard "Hannah" arrived and prevented flood protection due to extreme temperatures and snowfall.

On April 16, at a public meeting, Grand Forks mayor [[Pat Owens]] recommended that residents voluntarily evacuate the city.<ref>Shelby, p. 63</ref> The next day, approximately 500 airmen and women from Grand Forks Air Force Base were assigned to assisting with monitoring the dikes around the river.<ref>Shelby, p. 64</ref>

==The flood hits==
===The flood in Fargo===
The Red River crested in Fargo at 39.5 feet on April 17,<ref name="FintheV">{{cite web|last=Zent|first=Jeff|title=The Forum|work=Three-way race for flood plan: Fargo officials want to prepare for flood similar to '97's record|url=http://www.in-forum.com/specials/flood5yrslater/article.cfm?id=9104|accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> but dike-building efforts were able to prevent the water from flooding into a majority of the city.

I was very proud of them. I think it was one of Fargo's finest moments."<ref name="FintheV2"/>

===The flood in Greater Grand Forks===
[[Image:RedRiverGrandForks1997.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aeriel view of flooding in Grand Forks]]
There was some sense of imminent threat in Grand Forks, but the cities could not prepare for such an enormous flood. The [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) had a long-standing forecast for the river to crest at 49 feet (14.9 m),<ref name="USATodayNWS">{{cite web|title=USAToday.com|work=Flood of criticism from 1997 floods: Did faulty forecasts add to disaster?|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wrednws.htm|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> which was the river's highest level during the 1979 flood.<ref name="USATodayJAMS">{{cite web|title=USAToday.com|work=Record floods along the Red River in 1997|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wredjams.htm|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> The cities had been able to get their dikes to this level, but the river continued to rise past it, to the astonishment of the NWS (which did not upgrade its forecast until [[April 16]], the day the river actually reached 49 feet).<ref>Shelby, p. 60</ref><ref name="USATodayNWS"/> The dikes in the low-lying Lincoln Drive neighborhood of Grand Forks were the first to break, doing so early on [[April 18]].<ref>Shelby, p. 66</ref> Other dikes over the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks area would fail that day and the next, flooding thousands of homes. 

Water would end up reaching areas over two miles (3 km) away from the Red River, necessitating the evacuation of all of East Grand Forks and 75% of Grand Forks. School was canceled in both cities for the remainder of the term, as were classes at the [[University of North Dakota]].<ref name="UNDNo">{{cite web|title=UND|work=Great Flood of '97|url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/instruct/eng/fkarner/pages/flood97.htm|accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> The river crested at 54.35 feet (16.6 m) on [[April 21]] and the river level would not fall below 49 feet (14.9 m) until [[April 26]].<ref name="FEMA2">{{cite web|title=fema.gov|work=Grand Forks 1997 Flood Recovery: Facts and Statistics| url=http://www.fema.gov/hazard/archive/grandforks/statistics.shtm|accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref> The flood reached higher levels than the prior most severe flood in 1826.<ref name="RRBasin">{{cite web|title=Red River Basin|work=Flood tables| url=http://www.rrbdin.org/about/flood-tables.jsp|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Because water drained so slowly out of the most low-lying areas, some homeowners could not visit their damaged property until May. By May 30, the Red River had receded below flood stages everywhere in North Dakota.<ref name="AfterAction"/>

====Evacuations====
When the dikes in Grand Forks could not keep out the flooding river, Pat Owens ordered the evacuation of over 50,000 people on April 18, which up to that time, had been the largest civilian evacuation in the United States since the evacuation of residents in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="RedRiverRising">{{cite book|first=Ashley|last=Shelby|title=Red River Rising|publisher=Borealis Books|date=2003|location=United States|pages=102|isbn=0873515005}}</ref> She later reflected on the decision saying, "...if I evacuate this city and nothing happens they're gonna impeach me. But if I don't, we're going to lose lives."<ref name="NPR10">{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9566394|title=The Great Flood: Grand Forks 10 Years On|publisher=[http://www.npr.org/ NPR.org]|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> Because all transportation was cut off between the two cities (and for many miles, the two states), East Grand Forks residents were evacuated to nearby [[Crookston, Minnesota|Crookston]], namely to the [[University of Minnesota Crookston]], while residents of Grand Forks, who were given mandatory evacuation orders on April 18, went to [[Grand Forks Air Force Base]] (residents stayed in airplane hangers containing more than 3,000 cots).<ref>Shelby, p. 86</ref><ref>Shelby, p. 121</ref><ref>Jacobs, p. 68</ref>

With the assistance of the National Guard and Air Force personnel, several hundred patients were evacuated from local hospitals with no injuries or loss of life during the evacuation process.<ref name="FEMA1"/> Many residents also evacuated to motels and homes in neighboring communities. Some residents of Grand Forks criticized the National Weather Service for its incorrect prediction of the river level, as it had prevented them from securing their possessions from their homes. One resident said: "If they'd said earlier the river would hit 52 feet, I would have moved my stuff out of my house. At 49, it was safe."<ref name="USATodayNWS"/>

====Downtown Grand Forks fire====
The flood made national news. The most familiar footage is possibly of the fire that started on April 19 in [[downtown Grand Forks]], surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed.<ref name="CH&HW">{{cite book|first=Mike, Ed.|last=Jacobs|title=Come Hell and High Water|publisher=''[[Grand Forks Herald]]''|date=1997|location=[[Grand Forks, North Dakota]]|pages=8|isbn=0-9642860-2-5}}</ref><ref name="MSNBC07">{{cite web|title=N.

==Donations and damages==
The national attention of both flood and fire reached [[Joan Kroc]], the McDonald's heiress, who anonymously (her anonymity was later revealed to the public by the ''Grand Forks Herald''<ref name="PressArticle">{{cite news|last=Wangstad|first=Wayne|url=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/trib_20may97.html|title=http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/trib_20may97.html|publisher=Press Articles|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref>) donated $15,000,000 to be divided into $2,000 portions for each damaged household (though the amount some homeowners received was less due to the huge number of devastated homes; in all 7,500 households received funds).<ref>Shelby, p. 148</ref><ref name="AfterAction"/> Additionally, another single anonymous donor gave $5 million which was distributed in $1,000 allotments.<ref name="PressArticle"/> In November 1997, North Dakota Governor [[Ed Schafer]] reported that victims had been assisted by 50,000 relief agency volunteers who had served more than 2 million meals.<ref name="AfterAction">{{cite news| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010222134720/http://www.state.nd.us/dem/flood97/history.htm|title=North Dakota After Action Report - Historical Perspective|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> Additionally, the communities received clothing and supplies that were donated from every U.S. state.<ref name="AfterAction"/>

[[Image:Flood sculpture.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A memorial statue in Grand Forks with the rebuilt ''[[Grand Forks Herald]]'' building in the background]]
All told, there was $3.5 billion [[USD]] in damages to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, making it the eighth most expensive natural disaster in the U.S. since 1903.<ref name="SH149">Shelby, p. 149</ref> Across North Dakota and Minnesota, there were 4.5 million acres of land covered in water.<ref name="TimeArticle"/> Thousands of people were relocated after the disaster. In May 1997, the Red Cross conducted a damage assessment of 8,000 North Dakota homes.<ref name="AfterAction"/> The report indicated that 519 homes, 53 mobile homes, and 73 apartments had been destroyed by flood waters while 701 homes, 69 mobile homes, and 175 apartments sustained major damages.<ref name="AfterAction"/> Inspectors reported that 5,959 homes, 166 mobile homes, and 497 apartments received minor damages.<ref name="AfterAction"/> Over 5,200 businesses had been destroyed, damaged, or somehow affected by the winter and spring blizzards and the flood.<ref name="AfterAction"/> In Grand Forks alone, 75% of the homes, 315 businesses, and 16 of 22 local schools had been flooded.<ref name="AfterAction"/> East Grand Forks had over 500 condemned homes, with only eight homes not damaged by the flood.<ref>Shelby, p. 132</ref> Grand Forks, losing only 3% of its population from 1997 to 2000, did not fare as badly as its sister city, which lost nearly 17% of its residents. Not a single person was killed in the flood itself.

On April 22, President [[Bill Clinton]] flew over Grand Forks surveying the flooded cities.

Although North Dakota and Minnesota leaders initially asked the federal government for $100 million, but increased their projections to $500 million for Grand Forks and East Grand Forks.

==Criticism and blame==
[[Image:redrivergrandforkscairn.jpg|thumbnail|left|175px|[[Obelisk]] in Grand Forks commemorating the 1997 flood and other past floods]]
After the flood reached unexpected levels, Senator [[Kent Conrad]] wrote in a letter on April 30 that he was "very concerned about the capability of the National Weather Service to accurately and in a timely manner predict river levels on the Red River in North Dakota."<ref>Shelby, p. 131</ref> Earl Pomeroy told the ''Grand Forks Herald'' that "the inability to get realistic flood numbers certainly hindered the communities' ability to prepare."<ref>Shelby, p. 151</ref> Although the Grand Forks Corps of Engineers was also criticized for their efforts, they revealed that for the last ten years before the flood, the engineers had tried to convince citizens to 
approve the construction of a more extensive flood protection system.<ref>Shelby, p. 175 & 185</ref> Additionally, the head of the river-forecasting for the weather service of North Dakota and Minnesota attributed the rise of the Red River moving faster and higher than previously expected due to the sandbag levees that residents built to protect their homes, as it narrowed the channel of the river.<ref name="USATodayNWS"/>

The 5-foot (1.5 m) discrepancy between the actual crest and that which the NWS had predicted led to widespread anger among locals, especially since the citizens of both cities reached and even slightly surpassed the NWS's level of protection through weeks of hard work. Lynn Staus, the mayor of East Grand Forks initially complained on the NWS's predictions, "They missed it, and they not only missed it, they blew it big."<ref name="USATodayNWS"/> He later commented again, saying "I am not trying to blame the weather bureau. [But] we live day by day by those predictions, and many of our people did not go out and buy flood insurance."<ref name="USATodayNWS"/> Anger over the predictions was most famously expressed by a local resident's devastated home having the words "49 feet my ass" smeared on the exterior.<ref name="NOLA">{{cite news| url=http://www.nola.com/speced/ruinandrecovery/t-p/index.ssf?/speced/ruinandrecovery/articles/rising.html|work=NOLA.com|title=RISING FROM THE TIDE|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref><ref name="Shelby135"/>

==Recovery==
Over 20,000 volunteers went to Grand Forks to assist in recovery efforts.<ref name="FEMA1"/> The Red Cross dispersed over 25,000 clean-up kits (containing bleach, cleaning materials, goggles, and other equipment) funded by the State Department of Health that owners used to clean their flood-damaged property and possessions.<ref name="AfterAction"/> Since many possessions and appliances were contaminated by flood water, [[sewage]], [[mold]], and [[mildew]], residents were told by city officials to paint the word "Flood" or make some other mark to prevent [[looting]].<ref name="Shelby135">Shelby, p. 135</ref> Over 60,000 tons of flood debris was hauled to local landfills.<ref name="FEMA1"/>

Grand Forks' daily newspaper, the ''[[Grand Forks Herald]]'', continued to publish papers throughout the flood despite having its printing facilities destroyed. Newspapers were printed in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] and flown on a charter plane to Grand Forks for deliveries.<ref>Shelby, p. 103</ref> For their efforts, the staff of the ''Herald'' was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]].<ref name="MPRadio">{{cite news| url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/04/13/gfherald/|work=Minnesota Public Radio|title=Flood disaster changed editorial voice of Grand Forks newspaper|accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref>

Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had to decide whether to develop the land along the river. The president of East Grand Fork's planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, "The river had been our friend for all these years.

The National Weather Service has since revised their method of forecasting spring floods. Increased technology and funding has allowed for the mapping of the entire Red River bottom, more flood monitoring gauges, and up-to-date satellite images of the river at various flood stages.<ref name="MPRLessons">{{cite news| url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/04/10/lessons/|work=Minnesota Public Radio|title=Lessons from the flood|accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref>

The area continues to experience flooding as another major flood occurred April 2006.<ref name="Fema06">{{cite web|title=Grand Forks 1997 Flood Recovery: Milestones 1997 - 2007|publisher=FEMA|url=http://www.fema.gov/hazard/archive/grandforks/milestones.shtm|accessdate=October 18|accessyear=2007}}</ref> However, the Red River did not go near the level of the 1997 flood and only caused minor damage, primarily in rural areas, including water over roads and bridges.  The lack of damage done to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks in particular can largely be attributed to the aforementioned improved dikes and Greenway zone.<ref name="Fema06"/>

New dikes have been constructed in Fargo, Grand Forks, and East Grand Forks. Fargo initially had three different plans to choose for developing a dike, and construction of the dike was funded with $10.5 million it received from FEMA and $5.5 million from state funds.<ref name="FintheV"/> For Greater Grand Forks, the system of levees and new "invisible floodwalls" was completed in 2007, having cost several hundred million [[USD]]. The areas bordering both sides of the rivers has been converted into a giant park called the [[Greater Grand Forks Greenway]].

Since the flood, Grand Forks' recovery has been used as a model by other communities which have suffered from natural disasters. After [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit several U.S. states in 2005, Grand Forks adopted the city of [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]. Current Grand Forks mayor [[Michael Brown (mayor)|Michael Brown]] stated that it was important "to utilize the experience from those people who went through those disasters, like our fire chief, police chief and public works directors. So we went to Biloxi and said, 'This is what we have learned.'"<ref name="NPR10"/> Grand Forks leaders met with Biloxi city officials, and sent a list of contacts and a 24-page booklet that detailed how to coordinate volunteer agencies and how to interact with FEMA.<ref name="RedOrbitAdopt">{{cite news|last=Fee|first=Kevin|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/643351/biloxi_gf_gave_us_direction_advice_proved_invaluable_for_biloxi/index.html|publisher=[http://www.redorbit.com/ RedOrbit.com]|title=Biloxi: GF 'Gave Us Direction': Advice Proved Invaluable for Biloxi|accessdate=2007-11-17}}</ref> One Biloxi city official stated that Grand Forks had "just helped us to understand what we were looking at, and gave us some direction to go in, which was really needed, with the rebuilding and the recovering."<ref name="RedOrbitAdopt"/>

By 2007, the population of Grand Forks had resumed the same levels as before the flood.<ref name="FedGaz">{{cite news| url=http://www.minneapolisfed.org/pubs/fedgaz/06-09/cover.cfm|work=Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis|title=High and dry|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> East Grand Forks mayor Lynn Stauss stated "We like to call ourselves the poster child of flood recovery because we think we showed how different governments working together could make it happen."<ref name="MSNBC07"/><ref name="RWOnline">{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Deneen|title=East Grand Forks 'nation's poster child for flood recovery'|publisher=The Forum|url=http://www.prairiepublic.org/features/riverwatch/news/forum/04_14_02d.html|accessdate=November 3|accessyear=2007}}</ref>
