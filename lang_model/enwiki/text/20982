"'''Lisa Goes Gaga'''" is the twenty-second and final episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 23)|twenty-third season]]. It aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 20, 2012. In the episode, American singer-songwriter [[Lady Gaga]] makes a visit to Springfield, where all of its residents are in a state of depression. Main character [[Lisa Simpson]] is arguably the most depressed person in Springfield, prompting Gaga to go out of her way to teach Lisa the meaning of happiness.

[[Tim Long]] wrote the episode with Matthew Schofield as director. Lady Gaga guest-starred in the episode, portraying an animated version of herself. A fan of the show, Gaga was brought on by showrunner [[Al Jean]], who wrote a script after [[James L. Brooks]] saw an interview of her on ''[[60 Minutes]]''. The design team conceived eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga's eccentric persona, which satirized several of her outfits and included her [[Meat dress of Lady Gaga|meat dress]]. Recording sessions for "Lisa Goes Gaga" transpired in [[Los Angeles, California]] over four days in August 2011.

Television critics were divided with "Lisa Goes Gaga", who despite adulating the singer's performance, was critical of the episode's concept and general execution. Upon airing, the installment attained 4.79 million viewers and a 2.1 rating in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic, according to the [[Nielsen Media Research]]. 

==Plot==
[[Lady Gaga]] passes through [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] via train while on her way to a concert; when she sees how low the city's self esteem is, she takes it upon herself to cheer the whole city up. However, no one in town is more depressed than [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], who was voted ''Most Unpopular Student'' by her peers. She tries to reverse her status as one of the least popular girls in school by ghostwriting positive things about herself on the school blog under the heading "Truth Teller". 

When Bart finds out her secret and reveals it to the school, her social ranking plummets to a new low <U+2013> until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her outburst helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her (referring to Lisa tearfully telling Homer and Marge that she never began sobbing at home over her lonely status unless she knew they were both asleep), in effect making Gaga's mission successful. Lisa then catches Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven Lisa and Gaga perform a duet together. With Gaga<U+2019>s assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being yourself is better than being like anyone else.

"Their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny, I had to remind myself constantly of the sincerity of the humor," she explained. "That's what I was trying to focus on<U+2014>not putting on a character too much, and really being as sincere as I could with the lines."<ref name=EW/> Despite such emotions, Gaga professed that working with the staff of the show was "one of the coolest things that [she] has ever done".<ref name=EW/> 

Several employees of ''The Simpsons'' were impressed with Gaga's performance, who cited that her vocal range and ad-libbing skills were exceptional. Series creator [[Matt Groening]] stated: "Since the very beginning, I<U+2019>ve always wanted to have one the most iconic personalities of our time, and she's it."<ref name=EW/> In an interview with [[E! Online]], Groening further commented on Gaga's appearance; "The great thing about having Lady Gaga is that she came in a number of times and always with a different getup. Like she'd leave the room and come back in after a break in a completely new getup. It was unbelievable. The only time that she ever took off her hat was when it was banging into the microphone."<ref name=e!>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/jennifer_aniston_really_coming_cougar/193233|title=The Simpsons Celebrates 500 Episodes: How Kooky Was Lady Gaga?

The design team for the series conceived eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga's outr<U+00E9> and eccentric reputation, although they did not collaborate with any of Gag's stylists or creative director [[Nicola Formichetti]].<ref name=mtv22>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2012/05/18/simpsons-producer-reveals-details-of-anticipated-lady-gaga-episode/|title='Simpsons' Producer Reveals Details Of Anticipated Lady Gaga Episode|first=John|last=Mitchell|publisher=[[MTV]] ([[Viacom]])|date=May 18, 2012|accessdate=May 20, 2012}}</ref> Due to the outfits' unconventional appearances, Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes, as these rapid changes "wouldn't be possible in real life".<ref name=mtv2/> "There's a moment in the episode," Jean resumed, "when she starts out with her hair down. Then, there's a curtain pulled in front of her, and in seconds, she has a completely different outfit on with a cone bra and her hair is all hairsprayed up and big and frizzy. In real life, that would probably take 8 hours."<ref name=mtv2/> Many of the costumes were inspired from previous outfits Gaga had worn, including [[Meat dress of Lady Gaga|her meat dress]] and her [[Kermit the Frog]] dress. "We did a lot of research, looking back at her old outfits, and she's really been in a million different things, had a million different looks."<ref name=mtv2/>

==Cultural references==
Many aspects of Gaga's career are referenced in the episode.

The episode produced varying responses from television commentators. "Lisa Goes Gaga" provoked ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' journalist Rowan Kaiser to conclude that the installment "wasn't that painful to watch"<U+2014>albeit found the concept and general execution to be irritating.<ref name=av/> In her B<U+2013> review, Kaiser asserted that "Lisa Goes Gaga" used a straight-forward interpretation of the singer, and felt that Lady Gaga's appearance was superior to previous guest appearances. "So many ''Simpsons'' celebrity voices," she stated, "show up for a few minutes at most, with ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''-style 'Wow, [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]], what are you doing here?' Or they voice one-off characters without enough flair to be memorable. Instead, Gaga was the focus of the entire episode, to the point where if you wanted to call it a half-hour commercial for Lady Gaga, you probably wouldn<U+2019>t be wrong. Fortunately for 'Lisa Goes Gaga', the celebrity at its heart is entertaining enough that it being her commercial isn<U+2019>t a complete waste of time."<ref name=av>{{cite news|last=Kaiser|first=Rowan|title='Lisa Goes Gaga'|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/lisa-goes-gaga,75201/|accessdate=May 20, 2012|newspaper=[[The A.V.
