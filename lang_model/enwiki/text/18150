==History==
"Bois Blanc" is [[French language|French]] for "white wood". The name is commonly thought to be a reference to either: (a) the [[paper birch]], or more likely (b) the [[basswood]], called "bois blanc" in other contexts. The basswood's white underbark was extensively used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and French-speaking fur traders for cordage, including the sewing up of canoes and the manufacture of webbing for snowshoes.

Bois Blanc was ceded by the local [[Anishinaabe]] ([[Ojibwa|Chippewa]]) to the [[United States federal government|U.S. federal government]] with the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795. After extensive use as a source of kilned lime and firewood for [[Mackinac Island]] and other local frontier settlements, Bois Blanc was settled in the late 1800s as a summer resort community. The ''Bois Blanc Island Light'' lighthouse (1867) survives on the northern shore of the island; it is not open to the public.
