'''''Metroid Prime''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Retro Studios]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], released in North America on November 19, 2002. It is the first [[3D computer graphics|3D]] game in the [[Metroid (series)|''Metroid'' series]], and is classified by Nintendo as a [[Graphic adventure game|first-person adventure]]<ref>{{Cite web | author=Nintendo | url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/metroidprime/news.html?sid=6101089 | title=Metroid Prime company line| publisher=GameSpot | date=2004-06-22| accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> rather than a [[first-person shooter]], due to the large exploration component of the game. In North America, it was also the first ''Metroid'' installment to be released since ''[[Super Metroid]]'' in 1994; in all other markets, it was released after ''[[Metroid Fusion]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/metroidfusion/similar.html?mode=versions| title = Metroid Fusion release dates| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2007-02-23}}</ref>

''Metroid Prime'' is the first of the three part ''Prime'' storyline, which takes place between the original ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Metroid II: Return of Samus]]''.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://metroid.jp/metroid_version2/history/index.html|title=History|publisher=Metroid Zero Mission Official Site (Japanese version)|accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref><ref name = "time"/> Like previous games in the series, ''Metroid Prime'' has a [[science fiction]] setting, in which players control the [[bounty hunter]] [[Samus Aran]]. The story follows Samus as she battles the [[Metroid (series)#Space Pirates|Space Pirates]] and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV.

Despite initial backlash from fans due to the [[first person (video games)|first-person perspective]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=37|title= No Metroid For You|publisher=[[N-sider]]|date=February 19, 2001|accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref> the game was released to both critical and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone<ref name="magicbox" /> and becoming one of the most acclaimed games of all time.<ref name="metacritic" />

==Gameplay==
[[Image:M screen017.jpg|thumb|right|Samus facing a Flying Pirate, surrounded by a [[crosshair]]; also shown are: immediate area danger level (left), radar (top left), [[health (game mechanism)|health status]] (top middle), mini-map (top right), missile ammo (right), current/available [[Directed-energy weapon|beams]] (lower right), and current/available visors (lower left).]]
{{seealso|Metroid (series)#Common gameplay elements|l1=Gameplay of the Metroid series}}
As in previous ''Metroid'' games, ''Prime'' takes place in a large, [[linearity (computer and video games)|open-ended]] world with different regions connected by elevators. Each region has an entire set of rooms separated by doors that can be opened with a shot from the correct beam. The gameplay revolves around solving [[puzzle]]s to uncover secrets, [[platform game|platform jumping]], and shooting foes with the help of a 'lock-on' mechanism that allows [[circle strafing]] while staying aimed on the enemy. The game is the first in the series to use a first-person view as opposed to side scrolling, except in Morph Ball mode, when Samus's suit transforms into an armored ball and the game uses a [[third-person shooter|third-person camera]].<ref name="gamespot" />

The protagonist, Samus, must travel through the world searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open the path to the Phazon meteor [[impact crater]], while collecting [[power-up]]s that enable the player to reach previously inaccessible areas; the Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against extreme heat, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some of the items are obtained after [[boss (video games)|boss and mini-boss]] fights, encountered in all regions except Magmoor Caverns.

The [[HUD (computer gaming)|heads-up display]] simulates the inside of Samus's helmet, featuring a [[radar]], a map, ammunition for missiles, a [[Health (game mechanism)|health meter]], and a health bar for [[boss (video games)|bosses]] along with the boss name. The display can be altered by exchanging visors, including one using [[Thermography|thermal imaging]], another with [[x-ray]] vision, and a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses, and interfaces with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators, allowing the player to operate them.<ref name="manual" /> ''Prime'' also introduces a hint system that provides the player with a general idea of where to go.<ref name="manual">{{cite book| author=Nintendo| year=2002| title= Metroid Prime Instruction Booklet| publisher=Nintendo of America, Inc.| language=English}}</ref>

===Items===
[[Image:Morphball.jpg|thumb|right|Samus' Morph Ball form changes the view to a third-person camera.]]
Throughout the game, players must find and collect items that improve Samus' arsenal and suit, including [[Samus Aran#Beams|weapons]], armor upgrades for Samus' Power Suit and items that grant abilities. Among these are the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs, and the Grapple Beam, which works similarly to a [[grappling hook]] by latching onto special hooks, called grapple nodes, and allowing Samus to swing from them across gaps.<ref name="manual" />

Items from previous ''Metroid'' games make appearances with altered functions. Art galleries and [[Multiple endings|different endings]] are unlockable if a player obtains a high percentage of collected items and Scan Visor logs. ''Prime'' is the first ''Metroid'' game to address the reason Samus does not start with power-ups attained in previous games; she begins the game with certain upgrades, but, during an explosion in the Space Pirate's ship, they are all lost.<ref name="gamespy" /> The producers stated that starting with some power-ups was a way to give the player "different things to do" before settling into the core gameplay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2007/09/26/retro-studios-answers-the-dreaded-metroid-dread-question-and-other-prime-exclusives/|title=Retro Studios Answers The Dreaded <U+201C>Metroid Dread<U+201D> Question <U+2014> And Other <U+201C>Prime<U+201D> Exclusives|last=Totilo|first=Steven|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=2007-09-26|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

Players of the game can gain two features by connecting ''Prime'' with ''Metroid Fusion'' using a [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable]]: use of the Fusion Suit that Samus wears in ''Fusion'' and the ability to play the original ''Metroid''.<ref name="manual"/><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamecube/action/metroidprime/news.html?sid=2895768| title = Metroid Prime, Fusion connection revealed| publisher=[[GameSpot]]| date=2002-10-25| accessdate=2007-04-10 |first=Giancarlo |last=Varanini}}</ref>

==Plot==
''Metroid Prime'' has an extensive storyline, which was considered a major difference from previous ''Metroid'' games.<ref name="IGN" /> Short [[cutscene]]s appear before important battles, and the Scan Visor can be used to read records from the Chozo and the Space Pirates. The ''Prime'' trilogy is set between ''Metroid'' and ''Metroid II'',<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://metroid.jp/metroid_version2/history/index.html|title=History|publisher=Metroid Zero Mission Official Site (Japanese version)|accessdate=2007-10-01}}</ref><ref name="time">{{cite web|author=McLaughlin, Rus|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/815/815011p1.html|title=IGN Presents The History of Metroid|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2007-08-24|accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> but sources such as [[Gradiente]], Brazil's former distributor of Nintendo, and the ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' [[comic book|comics adaptation]] of ''Metroid Prime'',<ref>{{Citation

The Brazilian publicity even states that the Phazon meteor is a piece of Zebes,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.submarino.com.br/games_productdetails.asp?Query=ProductPage&ProdTypeId=12&ProdId=185415&ST=SE |title=''Metroid Prime'' on a large Brazilian e-shop| publisher=[[w:pt:Submarino (empresa)|Submarino]]| language=Portuguese| accessdate = 2007-07-19}}</ref> destroyed after ''Super Metroid''. However this contradicts the story of ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', which states that Phazon originated on a planet called Phaaze.

The game begins as Samus receives a distress signal from the Space Pirate [[Spacecraft|Frigate]] ''Orpheon'', whose crew has been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified experimental subjects. Upon arriving at the ship's core, she battles with the Parasite Queen, a giant mutated version of the tiny parasite enemies occasionally seen in the ship. Having defeated it, the Parasite Queen falls into the ship's reactor core, setting off the destruction of the ship. While Samus is escaping from the doomed frigate, an electrical surge destroys all of her Power Suit upgrades, and she encounters [[Metroid (series)#Recurring characters|Ridley]], now a cybernetic version of himself called Meta-Ridley. She watches as he flies towards Tallon IV before giving chase in her [[gunship]].

Samus initially lands on the Tallon Overworld, a rainforest-like area. She discovers the [[Metroid (series)#Chozo|Chozo]] Ruins, the remains of the Chozo civilization on Tallon IV that was destroyed with the crash of a meteor, which contained a corrupting substance called Phazon and a creature known to the Chozo as "The Worm".<ref>Chozo Lore "'''Meteor Strike'''" (NTSC version) : "A meteor came, casting a dark shadow of debris over the land with the violence of its impact. [...] But the meteor brought with it corruption. A Great Poison burst forth into the land, clawing at life with such violence that we were ripped from our peaceful state and find ourselves wandering as shadows of the mortal forms we left behind, searching for why we are here."</ref> Samus locates a Chozo temple in Tallon Overworld, and discovers that the temple houses a seal to the meteor's impact crater,<ref>Chozo Lore "'''Contain'''" (NTSC version): "And so, before it is too late, we now make our last stand. We have begun to build a temple to contain this darkness: at its heart we will place a Cipher, a mystical lock powered by twelve Artifacts and filled with as much power as we Chozo can harness in our ethereal states. Even when we are done, it may be too late."</ref> which the Space Pirates are trying to break.<ref>Pirate Data "'''Artifact Temple'''" (NTSC version) : "Field team reports are in on an aged structure of alien design built on the surface of Tallon IV. Studies show this structure projects a containment field. This field bars access to a prime source of energy within a deep crater. Science Team believes the field is powered by a number of strange Chozo Artifacts. We have found some of these relics and studies on them have begun.As this field could hinder future energy production operations on Tallon IV, we must dismantle it as soon as possible. If this means the destruction of the Chozo Artifacts, it will be done."</ref> The containment field is powered by twelve Chozo artifacts, which must be found to open the path to the crater.<ref>Chozo Lore "'''Binding'''" (NTSC version) : "The congregation of Artifacts that hold the Great Poison at bay still hold strong. Fearful of the potential within the Artifact Temple, the invaders known as Space Pirates tried to destroy it, only to fail in every attempt. We scattered the Artifacts across the planet for their protection, and only a few have fallen into invader hands. Failing to understand them, they now seek to unmake them. Again, they fail. They are right to fear these things. Great power sleeps inside them. Prophecy calls for their union, come the day that the unholy Worm is met by the great Defender. We can only hope the Artifacts are not destroyed by the invader, for then all will be lost. So, we do what we can to preserve the Artifacts, and to guide the Newborn to them." </ref>

Samus finds her way to the Magmoor Caverns, a series of [[magma]] filled underground tunnels. The Caverns are used by the Space Pirates as a source of [[geothermal power]], and connect all of the game's other areas together. Following the tunnels, Samus journeys to the Phendrana Drifts, a cold, mountainous location home to an ancient Chozo ruin, Space Pirate research labs used to contain [[Metroid (series)#Metroids|Metroids]], and ice caves and valleys home to electrical and ice-based creatures. After obtaining the Gravity Suit in Phendrana, Samus explores the interior of the crashed ''Orpheon'', and then infiltrates the Phazon Mines, the mining and research complex which is the center of the Space Pirates' Tallon IV operations. Here she battles Phazon-enhanced Space Pirates and obtains the Phazon Suit after she defeats the monstrous Phazon-mutated Omega Pirate.

During her exploration of Tallon IV, Samus finds the twelve keys to the Artifact Temple, and lores recorded by both the Chozo and the Space Pirates, providing some more insight about the history of the planet and the two races' colonization of it and other activities. As she puts the last of the keys in place, Meta Ridley appears and attacks her, but is defeated by Samus with some aid from the temple's defensive artillery. The Chozo Artifacts and Phazon Suit allow Samus to enter the Impact Crater, where she finds a Phazon-mutated beast called Metroid Prime, the source of Phazon. After she defeats it, all the Phazon on Tallon IV is sucked back into Impact Crater, including the Phazon in Samus's Phazon Suit, reverting her armor to the Gravity Suit. Samus then escapes the collapsing Impact Crater and leaves Tallon IV in her ship. In a [[post-credits scene]] only able to be seen if the player has collected 100% of the items, Metroid Prime uses the Phazon Suit to recreate its body, becoming the entity known as Dark Samus, the antagonist of ''Metroid Prime 2'' and ''3''.

After ''Super Metroid'', ''Metroid'' fans eagerly awaited a sequel. It was supposedly slated for the [[Nintendo 64]] or its ill-fated accessory, the [[Nintendo 64DD|64DD]], but while the game was mentioned,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://mdb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/index.php?p=newsarch96-99| title=News Archives: 1996&nbsp;<U+2013> 1999| publisher = Metroid Database| accessdate = 2006-02-21}}</ref> it never entered production. Developer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] explained that it was because Nintendo "couldn't come out with any concrete ideas".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/377/377563p2.html|title=Metroid Prime Roundtable QA|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2002-11-15|accessdate=2008-02-20}}</ref>

''Metroid Prime'' was developed as a collaboration between Retro Studios and important [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development|Nintendo EAD]] and [[Nintendo Research & Development 1|R&D1]] members. Retro Studios was created in 1998, by an alliance between Nintendo and former [[Iguana Entertainment]] founder [[Jeff Spangenberg]]. After establishing its offices in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1999, Retro received five game ideas for the future GameCube, among them a new ''Metroid'',<ref name="escapist">{{cite web| url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_39/235-Metroid-Primed| title = Metroid Primed| publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]| date = [[2006-04-04]]|accessdate=2007-09-16 |first=Allen |last=Varney}}</ref> despite not even having [[Software development kit|development kits]].<ref name="gama">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16389|title=MIGS 2007: Retro Studios On The Journey Of Metroid Prime|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date=2007-11-27|accessdate=2007-12-03|first=Mathew|last=Kumar|coauthors=Leigh Alexander}}</ref> Nintendo members, such as [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], Kensuke Tanabe and Kenji Miki, as well as ''Metroid'' designer [[Yoshio Sakamoto]], communicated with the Texas-based studio through emails, monthly phone conferences and personal gatherings. The game was originally envisioned as having third-person perspective gameplay, but this was changed to a first-person perspective after Miyamoto intervened, causing almost everything already developed to be scrapped. Among the reasons for leaving the third-person perspective were [[Rare (company)|Rare's]] trouble with the camera in ''[[Jet Force Gemini]]'', shooting in third-person "not being very intuitive" and exploration being easier using first-person.<ref name="gama"/> [[Game director|Director]] Miyamoto has also professed a fondness for games to be in the first person perspective in an interview with [[Satoru Iwata]]. He then said he even wanted ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' to take place in the first person perspective.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/crossbow/vol1_page1.jsp|title=Interview: Iwata asks: Link's Crossbow Training|publisher=Nintendo|accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> Mark Pacini said Retro tried to make the game so that the only difficult parts would be boss battles, so players would not be "afraid to explore", because "the challenge of the game was finding your way around".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=8476&Itemid=51|title=INTERVIEW: Retro Studios|publisher=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=2007-12-26|accessdate=2008-01-27}}</ref>

In 2000, three games were canceled to establish focus on ''Prime'', and in 2001, the fourth other project (an RPG called ''[[Raven Blade]]'') was canceled, so that ''Prime'' would be the only game in development.<ref name="retrohistory">{{cite web| url = http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=423&page=1| title = History of Retro Studios| publisher = [[N-sider]]| date = [[2004-12-17]]| accessdate = 2007-07-19}}</ref> The first public appearance of the game was a ten second video at [[Nintendo Space World|SpaceWorld]] 2000.

Kraid, a boss from ''Metroid'' and ''Super Metroid'', was intended to make an appearance in ''Prime'', and designer Gene Kohler modeled and skinned him for that purpose. However, time constraints prevented him from being included in the final version of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gen-n.net/dyk/002.shtml| title=Did You Know?

===Audio===
[[Kenji Yamamoto (Nintendo musician)|Kenji Yamamoto]], assisted by Kouichi Kyuma, composed the music for ''Prime''. The soundtrack contains [[remix]]es of tracks from previous games in the series, because Yamamoto wanted "to satisfy old Metroid fans.

The game supports Dolby Pro Logic II setups, which allows it to be played in surround sound.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.therecordist.com/pages/metroid_press.html|title=Metroid Prime Press|publisher=The Recordist|accessdate=2008-05-13}}</ref> There was an official soundtrack released for the game called Metroid Prime and Fusion Original Soundtracks which was supervised by Mr. Yamamoto himself.

===Versions===
''Prime'' was released in three versions: the original North American version; a second version, released in North America and Japan, with resolved technical issues (such as a glitch that occasionally caused the game to freeze when using elevators connecting to Chozo Ruins); and the European version, with resolved glitches and altered certain elements of the gameplay to prevent [[sequence breaking]].

The European translation had logs removed or changed, resulting in a different storyline and log book. For instance, a narrator was added in the opening and closing scenes. Some of the changes were in the NTSC region's [[Player's Choice]] re-release, along with more changes not in other releases.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.metroid2002.com/version_differences_version_number.php| title = Version differences: version number| publisher = ''Metroid2002.com''| accessdate = 2007-07-19}}</ref>

Before the release of ''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' in 2004, Nintendo released a platinum colored GameCube bundled with a copy of ''Prime'' containing a special second disc, featuring both a preview trailer and a [[game demo|demo]] for ''Echoes'', a timeline of ''Metroid'' games and an art gallery.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=37270| title = New Metroid Prime Bundle Announced for GameCube| publisher = [[GamePro]]| date = [[2004-04-08]]| accessdate = 2007-03-27}}</ref>

===Legacy===
{{further|[[Metroid (series)#Story|''Metroid'' series chronology]]}}
Three other ''Metroid'' games in the same first-person style were released after ''Prime'', as well as a pinball [[spin-off]]. The first was the sequel ''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'', released in November 2004 for the GameCube, in which Samus travels to planet Aether and discovers that a Phazon meteor crashed on the planet creating an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]], while fighting a mysterious enemy called Dark Samus. It was followed by ''Metroid Prime Pinball'', a spin-off game developed by [[Fuse Games]] and released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS.<ref>{{cite web| accessdate = 2007-07-19| url = http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/aacce0c4-2551-4de1-9e18-96549430fba6| title = Metroid Prime Pinball| publisher = [[Nintendo]]}}</ref> ''Prime Pinball'' is a virtual pinball game that features the locations and bosses of ''Prime''.

The next game released was ''[[Metroid Prime Hunters]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], with a storyline that takes place between the events of ''Prime'' and ''Echoes''. A demo of the game, titled ''Metroid Prime Hunters&nbsp;<U+2014> First Hunt'', was released with purchase of a Nintendo DS, and the full game was released on March 20, 2006 in [[North America]], and May 5, 2006 in [[Europe]]. The storyline follows Samus trying to discover an "ultimate power", while facing six rival bounty hunters. ''Hunters'' was not developed by Retro Studios, but by Nintendo's Redmond-based subsidiary [[Nintendo Software Technology]]. The game is more centered on first-person shooter aspects than ''Prime'' and ''Echoes'', with removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and various multiplayer modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/dsmetroidprimehunters/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=gssummary&tag=summary;review|title=Metroid Prime: Hunters review|last=Colayco|first=Bob|publisher=GameSpot|date=2006-03-12}}</ref>

''Prime''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s second full sequel is ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', which closes the ''Prime'' series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/670/670579p1.html|title=Metroid Prime 3 Details Emerge|publisher=IGN|date=2005-08-03|accessdate=2007-03-30|first=Matt|last=Casamassina}}</ref> and was released on August 27, 2007 for Nintendo's [[Wii]]. In ''Corruption''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story, Samus is corrupted by Phazon after being attacked by Dark Samus, who has become the leader of a Space Pirate group and is sending Phazon Seeds (called "Leviathans") to corrupt planets. ''Corruption'' makes changes in gameplay from ''Prime'' and ''Echoes'', such as trading the assisted aiming for free aiming with the [[Wii Remote]], and changing the interchangeable beams for a stackable upgrade system. Elements of ''Metroid Prime'' have appeared in other games, such as in the Wii game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' where the Frigate Orpheon is a playable stage, featuring the Parasite Queen in the background and a medley of the opening and menu music as soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/stages/stage20.html|title=Frigate Orpheon|publisher=[[Nintendo]]/[[HAL Laboratory]]|date=2007-12-18|accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/music/music22_list.html|title=First Songs in My Music|publisher=[[Nintendo]]/[[HAL Laboratory]]|date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> ''Metroid Prime'''s style of gameplay and HUDs also led to influence and comparison in later first-person shooters, such as ''[[Geist (video game)|Geist]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/geist/641298p3.html|title=Gamespy ''Geist'' interview|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=2005-08-15|accessdate=2007-10-21}}</ref> and ''[[Star Wars: Republic Commando]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/starwarsrepubliccommando/review.html|title=Star Wars: Republic Commando review|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2005-02-25|accessdate=2007-10-21|first=Bob|last=Colayco}}</ref>
