'''Anthony Aaron Volpatti''' (born May 30, 1985) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[winger (ice hockey)|winger]] with the [[Washington Capitals]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

==Playing career==
A native of [[Revelstoke, British Columbia]], Volpatti played [[junior ice hockey|Junior A]] hockey for the [[Vernon Vipers]] of the [[British Columbia Hockey League]] (BCHL). After recording 5 points (1 goal and 4 assists) over 55 games as a rookie in 2003<U+2013>04, he improved to 18 points (6 goals and 12 assists) over 57 games the following season. In the 2005 BCHL playoffs, the Vipers advanced to the Fred Page Cup Finals, where they were defeated by the [[Surrey Eagles]]. During a team camping trip that summer, Volpatti received burns to over 35% of his body (including his abdomen and face) in a bonfire accident. Hospitalized for five months, doctors told him he would not play again for two years, if at all. The use of his right hand was in particular jeopardy. Despite the prognosis, Volpatti returned to the lineup for the start of the 2005<U+2013>06 season, although injuries to his muscles limited him to 25 of the team's 60 games. He had a long and possibly impossible recovery but managed to dress for 25 games the following year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Teenage hijinks almost cost Canucks' Volpatti his career|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Teenage+hijinks+almost+cost+Canucks+Volpatti+career/5502495/story.html|accessdate=2011-12-03|date=2011-10-04|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|author=Kuzma, Ben|publisher=Postmedia News}}</ref> He recorded 6 goals and 14 points.

Following his three-year junior career, Volpatti moved on to the [[college hockey|college level]], joining the [[Brown Bears men's ice hockey|Brown Bears]] of the [[ECAC Hockey]] Conference (within the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]]; NCAA circuit). Vopatti majored in [[Human Biology]] at [[Brown University|the university]] and captained the team during his four-year college tenure. After recording a college career-high 32 points over 37 games with Brown in 2009<U+2013>10, Volpatti was signed as a [[free agent]] by the [[Vancouver Canucks]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) on March 22, 2010. He was subsequently assigned to their [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]], for the remainder of their [[2009<U+2013>10 AHL season|2009<U+2013>10 season]].<ref>{{cite book |last=National Hockey League|title=The National Hockey League Official Guide & Record Book/2011|year=2010 |publisher= Triumph Books |page= 341|isbn= 978-1-60078-422-4}}</ref> He recorded one goal and one assist over eight games.

After attending his first NHL training camp with the team in September 2010, he was re-assigned to the Moose for the start of the [[2010<U+2013>11 NHL season|2010<U+2013>11 season]]. He received his first NHL call-up on December 16,<ref name="winnipegfreepress">{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Tim|title=Moose lose Volpatti to Canucks|url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Moose-lose-Volpatti-to-Canucks-112016664.html|accessdate=17 December 2010|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=16 December 2010}}</ref> and made his NHL debut two nights later in a home game against the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. He scored his first NHL goal in his second game against [[Jaroslav Halak]] of the [[St. Louis Blues (ice hockey)|St. Louis Blues]] on December 20, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2010020493|title=Kesler's pair leads Canucks past Blues|author=Associated Press|date=2010-12-20|publisher=NHL.com|accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref> Volpatti finished his rookie professional season with a goal and an assist over 15 NHL games and 11 points (2 goals and 9 assists) over 53 AHL games. He added 3 points (1 goal and 2 assists) over 12 AHL playoff games.

The following season, Volpatti made the Canucks' roster out of training camp, playing on the fourth line with [[Maxim Lapierre]] and [[Dale Weise]]. During a game against the [[Los Angeles Kings]] in November 2011, Volpatti hurt his shoulder after receiving a hit from opposing defenceman [[Matt Greene]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Red-hot Canuck Higgins out vs Avalanche with Staph infection|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=382044|accessdate=2011-12-05|date=2011-12-05|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]|agency=Canadian Press}}</ref> Playing through the injury, he re-aggravated his shoulder the following month. Diagnosed with a torn left labrum, the injury required surgery that sidelined him for the remainder of the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canucks winger Volpatti done for season with shoulder injury|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=381892|accessdate=2011-12-03|date=2011-12-03|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref>

In the off-season Volpatti re-signed with the Canucks, signing a one-year [[two-way contract]]. The deal was a slight pay cut for Volpatti's NHL salary and much larger cut at the minor league level. His NHL salary went from $625,000 to $600,000, while his minor league contract went from $200,000 to $105,000. The minor league salary represented the maximum amount allowed to avoid being subject to re-entry or recall waivers.<ref name=wp>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Canucks+sign+winger+Aaron+Volpatti/6789235/story.html|title=Volpatti takes slight pay cut to remain with Canucks|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''|accessdate=2013-02-28|date=2012-06-15|last=Ziemer|first=Brad|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AqXKrbmd|archivedate=September 21, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> He began the [[2012<U+2013>13 NHL season|2012<U+2013>13 season]] with the Canucks playing in 16 games scoring 1 goal.<ref name=claim>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capitals-insider/wp/2013/02/28/capitals-claim-forward-aaron-volpatti-off-waivers/|title=Capitals claim forward Aaron Volpatti off waivers (updated)|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=2013-02-28|date=2013-02-28|last=Carrera|first=Katie}}</ref> After Vancouver had players return from injury Volpatti became the team's thirteenth forward and a regular [[List_of_ice_hockey_terminology#H|healthy scratch]].<ref name=pap>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2013/02/27/canuck-waive-fourth-liner-volpatti-ebbett-may-be-on-way-back/|title=Canucks waive fourth-liner Volpatti|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''|accessdate=2013-02-28|date=2013-02-27|last=Pap|first=Elliott}}</ref> Needing a roster spot to activate forward [[Steve Pinizzotto]] from the [[injured reserve]] list, the Canucks put Volpatti on [[Waivers (NHL)|waivers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vansunsportsblogs.com/2013/02/27/canucks-waive-aaron-volpatti-remind-everyone-they-have-a-guy-named-steve-pinizotto/|title=Canucks waive Aaron Volpatti, remind everyone they have a guy named Steve Pinizzotto|publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]''|accessdate=2013-02-28|date=2013-02-27|last=Mooney|first=Harrison}}</ref> Vancouver's plan was to assign him to their minor league affiliate, the [[Chicago Wolves]], in order to give him increased playing time and work on the [[penalty kill]].<ref name=pap/> However, before that could happen he was claimed off waivers by the [[Washington Capitals]].<ref name=claim/>
