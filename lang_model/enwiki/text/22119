'''Malin Diaz Pettersson''' (born 3 January 1994) is a [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[association football|football]] [[midfielder]] who plays for [[Tyres<U+00F6> FF]] of the [[Damallsvenskan]]. She previously played for [[AIK Fotboll Dam|AIK]].

==Club career==
Diaz made her debut for AIK as a 15-year-old against [[Sunnan<U+00E5> SK]] in October 2009. She scored her first goal for the club a week later, against [[Kopparbergs/G<U+00F6>teborg FC]]. She finished the 2009 season having played two matches, with one start and one goal.<ref name=sw_stats>{{cite web|title=Malin Diaz|url=http://us.women.soccerway.com/players/malin-diaz-pettersson/103740/|publisher=Soccer Way|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> After returning to AIK for the 2010 Damallsvenskan season, she made 16 starts in 19 appearances for a total of 1,488 minutes played. She scored two goals: one during a match against [[Kristianstad]] on 3 July in which AIK won 3-1 and another during a 2-2 draw against Ume<U+00E5> on 19 September.<ref name=sw_stats/>

Following AIK's [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] for the 2011 season, Diaz made 17 [[Swedish Ladies Football Division 1|Norrettan]] appearances, scoring two goals, as the club won promotion back to the [[Damallsvenskan]] for the following season. Dias signed a new two-year contract with AIK ahead of the [[2012 Damallsvenskan|2012]] season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Malin Diaz f<U+00F6>rl<U+00E4>nger |url=http://www.aikfotboll.se/Article.aspx?contentID=5013|publisher=AIK|accessdate=10 September 2013|language=Swedish|date=13 January 2012|first=Stefan|last=Mellerborg}}</ref> She made 21 appearances with 19 starts for a total of 1,656 minutes on the pitch for AIK during the 2012 season.<ref name=sw_stats/>

In January 2013, with AIK relegated again after a 3-4-15 season ended them up at the bottom of the league table, Diaz signed for league champions [[Tyres<U+00F6> FF|Tyres<U+00F6>]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Christen Press och Malin Diaz klara f<U+00F6>r Tyres<U+00F6>|url=http://www.tyresoff.se/web/article.asp?artID=430|publisher=Tyres<U+00F6> FF|accessdate=15 September 2013}}</ref> She reasoned that, although it would be difficult to break into the team, training alongside Tyres<U+00F6>'s star names would improve her as a player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Malin Diaz f<U+00F6>rklarar: D<U+00E4>rf<U+00F6>r blir det Tyres<U+00F6> |url=http://damfotboll.com/nyheter/2013/01/malin-diaz-forklarar-darfor-blir-det-tyreso|publisher=Damfotboll.com|accessdate=10 September 2013|language=Swedish|date=5 January 2013|first=Alva|last=Nilsson}}</ref> She made her debut for Tyres<U+00F6> during a match against [[Sunnan<U+00E5> SK]] on 19 May 2013, in which the team defeated Sunnan<U+00E5> 10-2. As of September 2013, she has made four appearances for the club.<ref name=sw_stats/>

==International career==
As a [[Sweden women's national under-19 football team|Swedish under-19 international]], Diaz featured at the [[2012 UEFA Women's U-19 Championship|2012 U-19 European Championship]]. She scored the victorious Swedish team's [[extra time]] goal in the 1<U+2013>0 final win over Spain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sweden match-winner Diaz realises dream|url=http://www.uefa.com/womensunder19/news/newsid=1841044.html#diaz+realises+dream|publisher=[[UEFA]]|work=Uefa.com|accessdate=11 September 2013|date=15 July 2012|first=Sam|last=Crompton}}</ref>
