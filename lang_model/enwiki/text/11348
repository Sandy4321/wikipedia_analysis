'''''Leva-me aos Fados''''' <small>([[English language|English]]: ''Take Me To The Fados'')</small> is the fourth album by Portuguese [[fado]] singer [[Ana Moura]], the successor to the multi-award winning "Para Al<U+00E9>m da Saudade" (2007).
''Leva-me aos Fados'' has a list of holdings of luxury where we highlight Jos<U+00E9> M<U+00E1>rio Branco, Lisbon Bagpipes, Manuela de Freitas, Am<U+00E9>lia Muge and Toze Brito. Like its predecessors, has the production of Jorge Fernando.
This album was less commercial then the last one. With 55,000 units sold, "Para Al<U+00E9>m da Saudade" was the album of the consecration of Ana Moura. There are 120 weeks in the top national sales, very close to achieving a Triple [[Platinum]] Award, this was the album that included the highly acclaimed "Os Buzios", "Fado da Procura" or "E viemos nascidos do mar". Its resounding success retrieving the previous albums - "Gurda-me a vida na m<U+00E3>o" (2003) and "Aconteceu" (2005) - which last year also reached the [[Gold]] Award.<ref name="anamoura329"/>

==History==
The most recent years Ana Moura have been happy. Ana Moura's duet with Mick Jagger in full concert by the [[Rolling Stones]] at [[Alvalade Stadium]], the platinum in the previous album "Para Al<U+00E9>m da Saudade" won for sales exceeding 20,000 units, the acclaimed world tour last year or Prize for Best Artist Amalia Ana Moura push for a star status. 
In "Leva-me aos fados" Ana Moura harnesses the wind and grows in proportion to time. Sure your right-hand man ever, Jorge Fernando, gives a help, especially in the composition of most of the 15 songs this long. Custodio Castelo, the 12-string guitar, and bassist Philip Larsen also say this. And Jos<U+00E9> M<U+00E1>rio Branco is the big name developer, co-author of bland Dark Water 
At the time of deviation of the disk, Ana Moura is right to warn that the song accompanied by Bagpipes of Lisbon 'N<U+00E3>o <U+00E9> Um Fado Normal', because it gives voice to a happy marriage between fado and [[Folk music|folk]], with some [[classic]] furnishings of old music. When inserted into your perimeter fado, bravely takes on a theme of Alfred Carpenter, 'Fado das <U+00E1>guas', and two traditional ones of fado. 
With the recognition of criticism also came the recognition from their peers and in 2008, Ana Moura received the Award for Best Artist Amalia.She stepped over 300 different stages in their last tour, she visited dozens of countries on several continents and was the focus of attention in 2008 when she stepped on stage the Alvalade Stadium to sing with [[Mick Jagger]], or more recently, when the echoes of the Press French realized the purposeful trip to see [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] singing in Paris.<ref name="anamoura329"/>

==Writing and composition==
[[File:Ana moura live.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Ana Moura performing at the promotion of the album in [[Lisbon]], 2009.]]
Moura began writing lyrics for the [[album]] in 2009 togheter with Fernando Jorge. Moura was constantly writing down words, exploring the form and meaning of sentences. She had written lyrics before, but called them "safe, just neatly rhymed words and that's that". For the [[album]], she took inspiration from her parents and her own experiences as a celebrity. Moura initially had a hard time embracing her past, looking back on it as a time of pain and confused embarrassment. Confronting her past helped her improve her confidence; she said "it was like I'd climbed Serra da Estrela, or jumped out of a plane. So many things that I had avoided for so long were right there".
By the end of 2009, Moura collaborated with members of the production. She first met with Cost<U+00F3>dio Castelo at his home.

Filipe Larsen later sent her a demo of "Rumo ao Sul", which she loved, stating "it was so refreshing to hear something so different from what I had been working on. To have something so fresh come in that somebody else had been working on and taken control of, was a nice break for me." Moura gave him another two sets of lyrics. He took parts from each set and blended them together to create the album's lead single "Leva-me aos fados".
The album became the first release to contain songs solely written by Jorge Fernando. Fernando composed the song "Caso Arrumado" on a grand viola; additional instruments were added during production. he wrote dozens of songs with various producers over a two-month period, many of which remain unreleased. After a set of lyrics were completed, she would record a vocal demo and evaluate the song's potential.
Moura had greater freedom to make the album sound as she wanted it to. Moura had totally creative control over the project. At first she believed that the album contained too many musical styles, but changed her mind, stating, "I thought, partly to justify it to myself, but mainly because it's the truth, that if I had a whole album that sounded like "N<U+00E3>o <U+00E9> Um Fado Normal", or a whole album that sounded like "Rumo ao Sul", it would be a lie, because I'm all over the place as a person".

==Recording and production==
[[File:Jorge Fernando.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The producer Jorge Fernando]]
In 2009, Moura began recording rough demos at World Village studios in Lisbon, Portugal. <br>The demos consisted of Moura's lyrical ideas over various backing tracks. The demos were later rearranged and real instruments were added to replace the samples or keyboards initially emulating them. All string and orchestral arrangements were recorded at World Village studios in Lisbon by Ana Moura and Jorge Frenando. The album was mixed at the studios by Jorge Fernando. The recording of "Leva-me aos Fados" took nearly three months, becoming the longest period of time Moura had worked on a project. Fernando later explained that the album took a few time to record "due to the pure perfectionism of all creatively involved".

==Release==
[[File:Ana Moura and rolling Stones.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Ana Moura together with [[Rolling Stones]] after their show in.]]
The album has been released during the month of October 2009 by Farol in most European countries. <br>On July 26, 2009 on Ana Moura's Official Site was announced: "Still no release date scheduled, Ana Moura is preparing a new album due out later this year. Ana Moura in the shows has followed essentially the alignment of their latest album, "Para Al<U+00E9>m da Saudade". 
Ana Moura said: "I'm not even trying any new song in addition to the fates of "Para Al<U+00E9>m da Saudade" corner themes of previous albums", she said in an interview with SIC.<br>"The new album from fado should hit stores this autumn, but will be attended by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. However, "it is certain that the two are working on a project together", said the source editor of [[Universal Music]] Portugal to 'JN'. <br>Ana Moura is still one of the voices of the new album from The Rolling Stones Project, the work led by saxophonist and musical director of the [[Rolling Stones]], Tim Ries. <br>In 'Stones World', the Portuguese singer returns to interpret the subjects' 'Brown Sugar' and 'No Expectations', the latter sung live and in duet with [[Mick Jagger]] in 2007 during the concert by British band in the Alvalade XXI Stadium".<ref>{{cite web|author=July 26, 2009 |url=http://www.anamoura.net/?p=197 |title=Prepara Novo <U+00C1>lbum |publisher=Ana Moura |date=2009-07-26 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>

==Style, album title and artwork==
In this work, we can also find a musical style somewhat different from those that are presented in their previous albums. This album has the participation of new sounds, including the folk and [[Acoustic music|acoustic]], which enrich the album a lot. On track number 7 we hear the ballad "Rumo ao Sul", where we find a mixture of different styles such as fado and acoustic, which made this track, one of the best songs on the album, the single was released as the last single of the album. As for the track number 15, "N<U+00E3>o <U+00E9> um Fado Normal" we can hear a faint sound of fado and a little mingled of folk in the song, making it one of the prettiest songs included on the album, and it was released as the second single.
Ana Moura took the liberty of mixing the styles already mentioned earlier, (folk and acoustic), styles that bring the album a sound more complex, but serene and beautiful.
The title of the new album by Ana Moura, announces a lightness of spirit and a contextualization of the genre more Portuguese outside the more lurid clich<U+00E9>s. 
And so does Ana Moura to the fourth [[studio]] [[album]], which shows the soul more melancholy race, who sings a lament more angry than a contemplative acceptance of the ills of life. In the cover for the standard edition, we can see the face of ana Moura shown in black and white with letters saying: "Leva-me aso Fados <br> Ana Moura". The cover for the deluxe edition is the same, without the letters. Both of the photographs has shot by Paulo Segad<U+00E3>es.

The album met with positive reviews, it was very well-received by critics. [[Allmusic]] gave the album a rating of 4 out of 5 stars and said: "Every song on this album is gorgeous and richly emotional without being bombastically emotive, and the rhythmic and thematic experiments <U+2014> a tango rhythm here, a strutting and defiant backbeat there <U+2014> only serve to deepen and enrich the tradition to which Ana Moura is clearly devoted". [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] gave a positive review to the album and said: "Moura communicates world-weary, indomitable courage spiced with a risqu<U+00E9> tang of dark passion that hurts so good". DiscoDigital gave a very positive review commenting that "the album is absolutly gorgeous, Ana Moura sings like she never sung before. The musical direction is perfect, Overall, the album is great from the beginning to the end". IOL M<U+00FA>sica gave the album a rating of 3 out of 5 stars calling it "a smoth sweet fado album". [[iTunes]] gave the album a positive review and said: "Every song on this album is gorgeous and richly emotional without being bombastically emotive, and the rhythmic and thematic experiments <U+2014> a tango rhythm here, a strutting and defiant backbeat there <U+2014> only serve to deepen and enrich the tradition to which Ana Moura is clearly devoted". Music Review gave the album a positive review and said: "You may not speak any Portuguese or know the first thing about fado music, but that shouldn't stop you from appreciating Ana Moura's recording Leva-Me Aos Fados. This is a wonderful recording of beautiful and haunting music that won't fail to touch your heart. If you've forgotten what true passion feels like, this will serve as a timely reminder". O Interior gave the album a arating of 3 out of 5 calling it "a great original album of fado"
[[PopMatters]] gave a rating of 8 out of 10 stars, saying: "Overall, though, this is another excellent showcase for Moura's art, with at least half of the album's tracks standing out as classics. It will be exciting to experience what the singer does with these new additions to her repertoire when she takes them on tour. As for the potential Prince collaboration, we will have to see whether fate wishes it to be or not". [[Rate Your Music|RateYourMusic]] was less favorable and gave the album a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. Rhapsody gave the album a favorable review and said: "she's found a way to make fado contemporary and engaging. In the album format, fado can feel slow and emotionally monotone -- what was romantic becomes downright depressing after 10 songs. But she combats that with a selection of lively, short (two-minute!) songs that even hide hooks in their velvet folds". [[Review|Seattlepi]] gave a positive review to the album and said: "Moura exhibits not only wonderful range as a singer, but control as well. There is no strain to be heard when she holds a note or as she goes up and down the scale. Unlike so many popular singers who attempt to make what they are doing sound difficult in order to impress us, there is a glorious ease in the way she moves through a song".

===Commercial===
Right now, "Leva-me aos Fados" is already a Gold Record, having crossed the 10,000 units sold. Thus promises to keep the legacy of multi-platinum "Para Al<U+00E9>m da Saudade" (2007).<ref name="anamoura329"/>

==Singles and music videos==

The first single released from the album was Leva-me aos Fados it was released in November 12, 2009 in Portugal. A music video was produced for the song, in the music video, we can see Ana Moura standing in a dark-brown-lightning room with men playing the Portuguese guitar while Moura sings. The second single of the album was Caso Arrumado, released in November 23, 2010, but it didn't get the people attention. In its music video we can see Moura singing in a dark room like in the previous music videos, in the other hand, the room is full of white lights. N<U+00E3>o <U+00E9> um Fado Normal was released as the third single of the album, in December 27, 2009. In the music video we also have the same idea, but in this time, the background vocals also appear.  The last single, Rumo ao Sul, released at February 20, 2010, became Ana Moura's most commercial single since "Os Buzios", released in 2007. The song charted at number one in Portuguese Charts and a music video was produced of it. The music video is basecly like "Leva-me aos Fados" music video.
