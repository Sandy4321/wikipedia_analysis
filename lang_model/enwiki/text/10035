==Reception==
Although ''Songs for Japan'' received praise for its charitable purpose it was criticized for being a compilation of already released songs, with the exception of [[Lady Gaga]]'s remixed "[[Born This Way (song)|Born This Way]]". This is unlike past charity albums such as ''[[Hope for Haiti Now (album)|Hope for Haiti Now]]'' that have included original music and performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2011/03/songs-for-japan-justin-bieber-bob-dylan-and-beyonce-unite-for-random-compilation-of-unoriginal-music/73049/#|title='Songs for Japan': Justin Bieber, Bob Dylan, and Beyonce Unite for Random Compilation of Unoriginal Music
