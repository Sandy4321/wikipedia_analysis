The '''German occupation of Luxembourg in World War I''' was the first of two [[military occupation]]s of the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] by [[Germany]] in the twentieth century. From August 1914 until the end of [[World War I]] in November 1918, [[Luxembourg]] was under full occupation by the [[German Empire]]. The German government justified the occupation by citing the need to support their [[army|armies]] in neighbouring [[France]], although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.

During this period, Luxembourg was allowed to retain its own government and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgian people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the [[economy]], [[education]], and [[constitutional reform]].

The domestic political environment was further complicated by the death of [[Paul Eyschen]], who had been [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg|Prime Minister]] for 27 years. With his death came a string of short-lived governments, culminating in rebellion, and constitutional turmoil after the withdrawal of German soldiers.

== Background ==
Since the 1867 [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London]], Luxembourg had been an explicitly [[neutral country|neutral state]]. The [[Luxembourg Crisis]] had seen [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] thwart [[France]]'s attempt to purchase the Grand Duchy from the [[Netherlands]]. Luxembourg's neutrality was accepted by Prussia's then-[[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]], [[Otto von Bismarck]], who boasted, "In exchange for the fortress of Luxembourg, we have been compensated by the neutrality of the country, and a guarantee that it shall be maintained in perpetuity."<ref>Speech by Bismarck to the North German Reichstag (in German), 27 September 1867.</ref>

In June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the thrones of [[Austria-Hungary]], was [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated]] by pan-Slavic nationalists, leading to a sudden deterioration in relations between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]]. Austria-Hungary was supported by the [[German Empire]], whilst Serbia had the backing of the [[Russian Empire]]. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia, which, in turn, required the [[mobilization|mobilisation]] of Russia, hence of Germany, thanks to its responsibilities under the [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]].

[[Image:Schlieffen Plan.jpg|thumb|350px|Under the [[Schlieffen Plan]], Germany sought to bypass the French defences by moving through Luxembourg and Belgium.]] Anticipating a retaliatory declaration of war from Russia<U+2019>s closest western ally, [[France]], Germany put into action the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. Under this military strategy, formulated by [[Alfred von Schlieffen|Count Schlieffen]] in 1905, Germany would launch a lightning attack on France through the poorly-defended [[Low Countries]]. This would bypass France<U+2019>s main defences, arranged to the south. Germany<U+2019>s army would be able to encircle [[Paris]], force France to surrender, and turn its full attention to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].

Since the 1860s, Luxembourgers had been keenly aware of German ambition,<ref>Calmes (1989), p. 340</ref> and Luxembourg's government was well aware of the implications of the Schlieffen Plan. In 1911, [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Eyschen]] commissioned an engineer to evaluate Germany's western railroad network, particularly the likelihood that Germany would occupy Luxembourg to suit its logistical needs for a campaign in France.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.lib.byu.edu/~rdh/wwi/1914m/lux-pm.html ''Operational Intelligence Report''].  24 September 1911.  Retrieved on 2006-07-23.</ref>  Moreover, given the strong ethnic and linguistic links between Luxembourg and Germany, it was feared that Germany might seek to [[annexation|annex]] Luxembourg into its empire.  The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 56">Thewes (2003), p. 56</ref>

== Invasion ==
[[Image:Luxembourg World War I labelled.png|thumb|left|Germany's main invasion thrust was towards Luxembourg City.]]
On 1 August 1914, Germany declared war on Russia.  On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised.  Initially, Luxembourg was only a transit point for [[Albrecht, Duke of W<U+00FC>rttemberg|Albrecht von W<U+00FC>rttemberg's]] [[German Fourth Army|Fourth Army]].  One of the [[railway]]s from the northern [[Rhineland]] into France passed through [[Troisvierges]], in the far north of Luxembourg, and Germany's first infringement of Luxembourg's sovereignty and neutrality was the unauthorised use of [[Troisvierges railway station|Troisvierges station]].<ref>Telegram from Eyschen to Jagow (in German), 1 August 1914.</ref> Eyschen protested, but could do nothing to prevent Germany's incursion.

The next day, Germany launched a full invasion.  German soldiers began moving through south-eastern Luxembourg, crossing the [[Moselle River]] at [[Remich]] and [[Wasserbillig]], and headed towards the capital, [[Luxembourg City]].<ref>Telegram from Eyschen to assorted foreign ministers (in French), 2 August 1914.</ref>  Tens of thousands of German soldiers had been deployed to Luxembourg in those twenty-four hours (although the Grand Duchy's government refuted any precise number that was suggested).<ref>Speech by Eyschen to the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies (in French), 3 August 1914.</ref>  [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duchess]] [[Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de]] ordered that the Grand Duchy's small army, which numbered under 400,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/luxembourgarmy.php#4A | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060822160910/http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/luxembourgarmy.php#4A | archivedate = 2006-08-22 | title = ''The Luxembourg Army'' | accessdate = 2006-07-23 | author = Roland Gaul | last = Gaul | first = Roland }}</ref> not resist, and, on the afternoon of the 2 August, she and Eyschen met the German commander, ''[[Oberst]]'' [[Richard Karl von Tessmar]], on [[Luxembourg City]]'s [[Adolphe Bridge]], the symbol of Luxembourg's modernisation.<ref name="Richard Doody">{{cite web | url =http://worldatwar.net/nations/luxembourg/narrative.html | title = ''The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg'' | accessdate = 2006-07-23 | author = Richard Doody | last = Doody | first = Richard |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060712080151/http://worldatwar.net/nations/luxembourg/narrative.html |archivedate = July 12, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>  They protested mildly, but both the young Grand Duchess and her aging statesman accepted German military rule as inevitable.<ref>O'Shaughnessy (1932), p. 155 </ref>
[[Image:Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg.jpg|thumb|175px|Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, German Chancellor.]]
On 2 August, German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg]] justified the complete occupation of Luxembourg in terms of military necessity, arguing that France was ready to invade Luxembourg itself.<ref name="Bethmann-Hollweg 2 August 1914">Telegram from Bethmann-Hollweg to Eyschen (in German), 2 August 1914.</ref>  The French minister in Luxembourg dismissed this argument, claiming that it would not have considered violating Luxembourg's neutrality unless Germany had done so first.<ref>Letter from Mollard to Eyschen (in French), 3 August 1914.</ref>  Bethmann Hollweg attempted to prove his country's regret by offering Luxembourg compensation for the losses due to the military presence.<ref name="Bethmann-Hollweg 2 August 1914" />  On 4 August, Bethmann Hollweg told the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]: {{cquote|We have been forced to ignore the just protestations of Luxembourg and the Belgian government.  We shall make amends for this injustice as soon as our military goal is accomplished.<ref>Speech by Bethmann-Hollweg to the German Reichstag (in German), 4 August 1914.</ref>}}

However, when it seemed that Germany was on the verge of victory, the Chancellor began to revise his statements.  In his ''[[Septemberprogramm]]'', Bethmann Hollweg called for Luxembourg to become a German federal state, and for that result to be forced upon the Luxembourgian people once Germany achieved victory over the [[Triple Entente]].<ref>{{de icon}} [http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/dokumente/hollweg/ ''Septemberprogramm des Reichskanzlers Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg''].  9 September 1914.  Retrieved on 2006-07-23.</ref>  Given this promise, it came as a great relief to most Luxembourgers that the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and French halted the German advance at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] in mid-September.  The result for the combatant nations was [[trench warfare]], but, for Luxembourg, it was the indefinite continuation of German occupation.

== Eyschen government ==
[[Image:Paul Eyschen photograph by Grieser.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Eyschen's long premiership had been one of peace and prosperity.]]
Just as the war was in the balance on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], so the fate of Luxembourg was see-sawing back and forth.  It was clear to all that the good conduct of the Luxembourgian government, if fully receptive to the needs of the German military administrators, could guarantee Luxembourg's continued self-government, at least in the short-term.  [[Paul Eyschen|Eyschen]] was a familiar and overwhelmingly popular leader, and all factions put their utmost faith in his ability to steer Luxembourg through the diplomatic minefield that was occupation.  On 4 August 1914, he expelled the French minister in Luxembourg at the request of the German minister,<ref>Telegram from Eyschen to Mollard (in French), 4 August 1914</ref> followed by the Belgian minister four days later and the Italian minister when his country entered the war.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mersch |first=Jules |authorlink=Jules Mersch |title=Biographie Nationale du Pays de Luxembourg |year=1953 |publisher=Victor Buck |location=Luxembourg City |chapter=Paul Eyschen |page=132}}</ref>  To the same end, Eyschen refused to speak ill of the German ''[[Zollverein]]'',<ref name = "Thewes 2003 56" /> even though he had talked openly of exiting the [[customs union]] before the war began.<ref>Letter from Eyschen to Nyssens (in French), 28 December 1882.</ref>

On occasions, Eyschen's principles got the better of him.  On 13 October 1914, a Luxembourgian journalist named Karl Dardar was arrested by the German army for publishing anti-German stories.  He was then taken to [[Koblenz]], and tried and sentenced by [[court-martial]] to three months [[imprisonment]].  Eyschen was outraged that the Germans had kidnapped a Luxembourgian citizen and tried him for an extraterritorial offence, and Eyschen did nothing to hide his indignation.  Eyschen told the German minister in Luxembourg that the action was a 'direct injury to the Grand Duchy's national sovereignty'.<ref>Telegram from Eyschen to Buch (in German), 8 December 1914.</ref>

Such vexatious complaints were repeated, by both Eyschen and [[Victor Thorn]], when a railway worker was arrested in January 1915 for allegedly working for French [[military intelligence]], and subsequently tried and sentenced in [[Trier]].  As [[Minister for Justice]], Thorn was incensed that the Luxembourgian legal system had been treated with such disdain.<ref>Telegram from Thorn to Berg (in German), 1 February 1915.</ref>  Such objections were not received well by the German authorities.  Although they tired of Eyschen's stubborn ways, he remained a useful tool to unite the various Luxembourgian political factions.

Eyschen was not alone in letting his principles obstruct government business.  In the summer of 1915, Eyschen pushed to further reduce the role of the Catholic Church in the [[state school]] system.  Grand Duchess Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de objected.  A fervently religious Catholic (as was most of the country, but not her late father, who was [[Protestantism|Protestant]]), she was reputed to have said, "I will not allow their most precious heritage [Roman Catholicism] to be stolen while I have the key."<ref>O'Shaughnessy (1932), pp. 134<U+2013>135</ref>  Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de refused to budge, inviting Eyschen to resign if he could not accept her decision.  Eyschen nearly did, but decided to control himself.<ref>Calmes (1989), p. 93</ref>  Nevertheless, he would not be long in the job.

== After Eyschen ==
=== Eyschen's death ===
[[Image:Paul Eyschen funeral cortege.JPG|thumb|left|The outpouring of national grief at Eyschen's funeral was evidence of the nation's debt to him. His death in office led to three years of political upheaval.]]
On 11 October 1915, Luxembourg's political system was brought to its knees by the death of Paul Eyschen.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 64">Thewes (2003), p. 64.</ref> When war broke out, Eyschen had been 73 years old, but his premiership of twenty-seven years was the only government that most Luxembourgers had known.  Throughout the first year of German occupation, he had been a rock for the Luxembourgian people.  He had also been of great importance to Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de; the Grand Duchess had never been groomed for the position,<ref>O'Shaughnessy (1932), p. 65.</ref> was fifty-three years Eyschen's junior, and was considered both politically na<U+00EF>ve and dangerously partisan for a [[constitutional monarch]].  The recent strains were relatively cosmetic.

Critically, Eyschen had the [[Confidence (political science)|confidence]] of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], and he had managed to hold together a government containing all major factions, seemingly by force of personality alone.  To make matters worse for national unity, the strain of occupation had broken apart the pre-war [[anti-clericalism|anti-clericalist]] alliance between the [[socialism|socialist]] and the [[liberalism|liberal]] factions, thus depriving both the clericalists and anti-clericalists of a legislative [[majority]].<ref name = "Thewes 2003 64" />  The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[conservatism|conservatives]] formed the largest bloc, but they were least likely to form a majority [[coalition]].

=== Mongenast government ===
The day after Eyschen's death, Grand Duchess Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de invited [[Mathias Mongenast]], who had been Minister for Finance since 1882, to form a minority government.  Mongenast's special status as a '[[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]]' Prime Minister is underlined by his official title; he was not '[[President of the Government]]', as all other Prime Ministers since 1857 had been, but held the lesser title of '[[President of the Council]]'.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 65">Thewes (2003), p. 65.</ref>

Mongenast's administration was never intended to be long-lived, and Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de's main objective when appointing the experienced Mongenast was to steady the ship.  Nevertheless, nobody expected the government to fall as soon as it did.  On 4 November 1915, Mongenast nominated a new candidate for head of Luxembourg's ''[[Normal school|<U+00E9>cole normale]]''.  The nomination did not meet with Grand Ducal approval, and Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de rejected him.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 65" />  Mongenast persisted; education had been a hobby horse of his, and he imagined that the Grand Duchess would accept the advice of a minister as experienced as he was.  He was wrong; the Grand Duchess had always been single-minded, and resented a minority Prime Minister, particularly one so new to the job, making demands of her.  The next day, Mongenast resigned, just twenty-five days after being given the job.

=== Loutsch government ===
Having fought with Mongenast, the Grand Duchess decided to appoint an all-conservative cabinet.  The Chamber of Deputies was steadfastly opposed; the [[Party of the Right (Luxembourg)|Party of the Right]] held only 20 seats out of 52, but they formed the [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]].<ref name="Thewes 2003 66">Thewes (2003), p. 66</ref>  Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de sought to end this deadlock by [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolving]] the Chamber of Deputies and by calling for the voters to grant a mandate to the conservatives.  This outraged the left, which assumed that its deputies alone had the constitutional right to grant the government confidence;<ref name="Thewes 2003 66" /> it was dubbed by those on the left a '[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] by the Grand Duchess'.<ref>Kreins (2003), p. 88.</ref>  Nonetheless, on 23 December 1915, Luxembourg went to the polls.  Although the position of the Party of the Right was improved, taking 25 seats, it fell a whisker short of winning an absolute majority.  On 11 January 1916, the Chamber of Deputies passed a [[motion of no confidence]], and Loutsch resigned.

== National Union Government ==
{{Main|National Union Government (1916)}}
=== Forming a consensus ===
After the failure of the all-conservative government, the Grand Duchess turned to the leading liberal politician, [[Victor Thorn]], to form a new government.  After Eyschen's premiership of 27 years, two governments had come and gone in three months, and the Luxembourgian people were becoming disillusioned with the failure of the politicians.  Thorn's nature was to be a conciliatory leader, and he made a direct appeal to the Chamber of Deputies to support his government, no matter the deputies' individual ideological persuasions: "If you want a government that acts, and is capable of acting, it is imperative that all parties support this government."<ref>Speech by Thorn to the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies (in French), <!--Exact date unknown, add if known--> February 1916</ref>  This support was forthcoming from all parties, but only on the condition that each was invited into the government; Thorn was left with no choice but to afford them this.  The resulting [[grand coalition]] cabinet included every leading light in Luxembourgian politics; besides Thorn himself, there were the conservatives [[L<U+00E9>on Kauffmann]] and [[Antoine Lefort]], the socialist leader [[Michel Welter|Dr Michel Welter]], and the liberal [[L<U+00E9>on Moutrier]].<ref name = "Thewes 2003 69">Thewes (2003), p. 69.</ref>

=== Food shortage ===
The most pressing concern of the Luxembourgian government was that of food supply.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 68">Thewes (2003), p. 68.</ref>  The war had made importation of food an impossibility, and the needs of the German occupiers inevitably came before those of the Luxembourgian people.<ref name="Thorn 28 August 1916">Letter from Thorn to Buch (in German), 28 August 1916</ref>  To halt the deteriorating supply of food, Michel Welter, the Director-General for both agriculture and commerce, banned the export of food from Luxembourg.<ref>Letter from Tessmar to assorted commanders (in German), 8 May 1916</ref>  Furthermore, the government introduced [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] to counteract the soaring demand and to make food more affordable for poorer Luxembourgers.  However, the measures did not have the desired effect.  Increasing numbers of Luxembourgers turned to the [[black market]],<ref name = "Thewes 2003 68" /> and, to the consternation of the Luxembourgian government, the German army of occupation seemed to do little to help.  Moreover, the government accused Germany of aiding the development of the black market by refusing to enforce regulations, and even of smuggling goods themselves.<ref name="Thorn 28 August 1916" />

Through 1916, the food crisis deepened, compounded by a poor [[potato]] harvest across all of the Low Countries; in neighbouring Belgium, the harvest was between 30% and 40% down on the previous year.<ref>Letter from Hoover to Percy, 7 October 1916</ref>  Although many Luxembourgers were on near-[[starvation]] level dietary intakes,<ref name="Thorn 28 August 1916" /> the country managed to avoid [[famine]].  In part, this was due to a reduction of German soldiers' dependence upon local food sources, instead relying on imports from Germany.<ref>Letter from Buch to Thorn (in German), 4 October 1916</ref>

Despite the avoidance of a famine, the Luxembourgian government lost much of the faith placed in it by the public and by the politicians.  On 22 December 1916, Michel Welter, the minister responsible, was censured by the Chamber of Deputies, which demanded his resignation.  Thorn procrastinated, seeking any option but firing the leader of one of three major parties, but could find none.  On 3 January 1917, Welter was fired, and replaced by another socialist, [[Ernest Lecl<U+00E8>re]].<ref name = "Thewes 2003 69" />  Even after the change and von Tessmar's promise of his soldiers' better conduct in future, L<U+00E9>on Kauffmann was capable of citing thirty-six instances of German soldiers caught smuggling foodstuffs between March 1917 and June 1918.<ref>Letter from Kauffmann to Kirsch (in German), 26 September 1918</ref>

=== Miners' strike ===
[[Image:Von Tessmar caricature.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Von Tessmar's swift suppression of the strike undermined Thorn's government.]]
Discontent amongst the population grew constantly, particularly in the country's industrialised south.  The autumn of 1916 had seen the first [[unionisation]] within the iron and steel industries, with [[trade union]]s springing up in both Luxembourg City and [[Esch-sur-Alzette]].<ref name = "Thewes 2003 69" />  Despite the war demand, iron production had slumped,<ref name="Graph of iron and steel production">{{cite web |url=http://www.statec.lu/html_en/portrait_economique_du_luxembourg/english/chap1/graf/steel.gif |title=Graph of iron and steel production |accessdate=2006-07-23 |author=Chambre of Commerce <U+2013> Groupment des Industries Sid<U+00E9>rurgiques Luxembourgeoises |format=GIF |publisher=[[Statec]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060824185300/http://www.statec.lu/html_en/portrait_economique_du_luxembourg/english/chap1/graf/steel.gif |archivedate=2006-08-24 }}</ref> leading to greater employment insecurity.  In March and April, three [[independent (politician)|independents]] were elected as deputies from the canton of [[Esch-sur-Alzette (canton)|Esch-sur-Alzette]], where the economy was dominated by iron and steel.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 69" />  As independents, these newly-elected deputies were the only legislative [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] to the National Union Government.

For many Luxembourgers, particularly the miners, expression of disgust at the government could not be directed through the ballot box alone.  Sensing the threat of civil disobedience or worse, von Tessmar threatened any individual committing an act of violence (in which he included [[strike action]]) with the [[death penalty]].<ref>Proclamation by Tessmar to steel workers at Differdange (in German), 10 May 1917</ref>  However, on 31 May 1917, the workers sought to use their most potent weapon, by defying von Tessmar's ultimatum and downing tools.<ref>Telegram from Thorn to Arendt (in German), 2 June 1917</ref>  Germany was dependent upon Luxembourgian iron, as the British [[Royal Navy]]'s naval [[blockade]] forced Germany to look to accessible local supplies; in 1916, Luxembourg produced over one-seventh of the Zollverein's [[pig iron]].<ref name="Graph of iron and steel production" /><ref>[http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/rectdata/01/a01215.dat Zollverein pig iron production].  National Bureau of Economic Research.  Retrieved on 2006-07-23.</ref>  As such, Germany simply could not afford a strike, lest it be deprived of critical raw materials.

In putting down the strike, von Tessmar was ruthlessly efficient, but he was not required to resort to the executions that he had threatened.  Within nine days, the strike was defeated and the leaders arrested.<ref name="Kauffmann 3 August 1917">Letter from Kauffmann to Zimmerman (in German), 3 August 1917</ref>  The two ringleaders were then sentenced by German court-martial in [[Trier]] to ten years imprisonment, to the disgust of the government.<ref name="Kauffmann 3 August 1917" />  The continued refusal of the German authorities to respect the Luxembourgian government, and the humiliating manner in which the strike was put down by German military muscle rather than the Luxembourgian [[gendarmerie]], were too much for Thorn.  On 19 June 1917, the government resigned.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 69" />

== Kauffmann government ==
Although the experiment in grand coalition had failed, the need for some political unity remained.  As the National Union Government was collapsing, Kauffmann arranged an alliance between his Party of the Right and Moutrier's [[Liberal League (Luxembourg)|Liberal League]], seeking to achieve change that would outlive the occupation.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 72">Thewes (2003), p. 72.</ref>  The primary objective was to address the perennial grievances of the left by amending the constitution; in November 1917, the Chamber of Deputies launched a wide-ranging series of debates on various amendments to the constitutions.  Ultimately, the constitution was amended to prohibit the government from entering into [[secret treaty|secret treaties]], to improve deputies' pay (hitherto set at just 5 [[Luxembourgian franc|francs]] a day),<ref name="M<U+00E9>morial A, 1868:23">{{fr icon}}/{{de icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1868/0232210/0232210.pdf | title=M<U+00E9>morial A, 1868, No. 23 | accessdate=2006-07-23 | format=PDF | publisher=Service central de l<U+00E9>gislation }}</ref> to introduce [[universal suffrage]], and to change the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] [[voting system]] to a [[Proportional representation|proportional]] one.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 72" />

Whereas all of the above measures were broadly popular, across most of the political spectrum, the same was not true of the proposal to amend Article 32.  Said article had not been amended in the overhaul of 1868, and its text had remained unchanged since the original constitution of 1848, stating unequivocally that all [[sovereignty]] resided in the person of the Grand Duchess.<ref name="M<U+00E9>morial A, 1868:23" />  For some, particularly those that resented the close relations between Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de and the German royalty, the idea of national sovereignty residing in such a person was unacceptable.  The Chamber of Deputies voted to review Article 32, but Kauffmann refused to allow it, seeing the redefinition of the source of national sovereignty as covert [[republicanism]].<ref name = "Thewes 2003 72" />

The summer of 1918 saw a dramatic decline in the fortunes of the government.  On 8 July, [[Clausen, Luxembourg|Clausen]], in central Luxembourg City, had been bombed by the British [[Royal Air Force]], killing ten civilians.<ref>Faber (1932), p. 155</ref>  Although this did not endear the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] to Luxembourgers, the Grand Duchess' instinct was to run to the Germans, who were even less popular amongst the people.  On 16 August, German Chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]] paid a visit to Luxembourg; although Hertling asked only to see the Grand Duchess, Kauffmann asked that he also attend.  To the Luxembourgian people, relations between the two countries now seemed unambiguously cordial, and all that was left of Kauffmann's credibility disappeared.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 72" />  This was compounded further by the news on the 26 August of the [[engagement]] of [[Princess Antonia of Luxembourg]] to [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria]], who was ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' in the German army.<ref>Thewes (2003), p. 74.</ref>  Pressure mounted on Kauffmann; with his party still strong, but with his personal reputation shattered, he was left with no option but to resign, which he did on 28 September in favour of [[<U+00C9>mile Reuter]], another conservative.<ref>Thewes (2003), p. 76.</ref>

== End of the war ==
=== Armistice ===
[[Image:General John Joseph Pershing head on shoulders.jpg|thumb|upright|United States General John Joseph Pershing.]]
By the autumn of 1918, Germany's position in the war was becoming untenable.  The massive [[Spring Offensive]] had been an unmitigated disaster, whereas the Allied [[counter-attack]], the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], had driven Germany back towards its own borders.  On 6 November, von Tessmar announced the full withdrawal of German soldiers from Luxembourg.<ref>Letter from Tessmar to Reuter (in German), 6 November 1918.</ref>  Five days after von Tessmar's announcement, Germany signed an [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice treaty]], which brought an end to the war of four years.  One of the terms of the armistice involved the withdrawal of German soldiers from Luxembourg, along with the other occupied countries.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.grande-guerre.org/Documents/Armistice.htm La convention d'armistice]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}, Article A(I).  11 November 1918.  Retrieved on 2006-07-23.</ref>

The Allied Powers agreed that the German withdrawal from Luxembourg would be observed by the [[United States]], and that the USA would receive the honour of liberating the captive country.  On 18 November, [[John Pershing|General John Pershing]] issued a [[proclamation]] to the people of Luxembourg, stating that the United States' newly-formed [[United States Third Army|Third Army]] would move through Luxembourg to occupy the German [[Rhineland]], but that the Americans would come as allies and as liberators:

{{quote|After four years of violation of its territory, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is to be fortunately liberated. ... American troops enter the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as friends, and will abide rigorously by international law.  Their presence, which will not be extended longer than is absolutely necessary, will not be a burden upon you.  The operation of the government and institutions will not be impeded.  Your lives and livelihoods will not be disturbed.  Your person and your property will be respected.<ref>Proclamation by Pershing to the people of Luxembourg (in French), 18 November 1918.</ref>}}

The following day, American soldiers crossed the Franco-Luxembourgian border.  Everywhere, they were f<U+00EA>ted as liberators, in the spirit that Pershing had intended to inspire, and were met by bands and civilians waving flags, and were adorned with flowers.<ref name="March into Germany">[http://www.arcent.army.mil/history/march_germany.asp ''March into Germany'']{{dead link|date=July 2010}}.

Germany's defeat created the perfect opportunity for the Allied powers to resolve the Luxembourgian question once and for all.  By removing Luxembourg from Germany's [[sphere of influence]], they hoped to guarantee its continued independence, and thus preserve the peace they had won. On 19 December, at the instigation of the British and French governments, the Luxembourgian government announced its withdrawal from the ''[[Zollverein]]'' and an end to the railway concessions that Luxembourg had previously granted Germany.<ref>Thewes (2003), p. 79.</ref>

=== Rebellion ===
Although the Allies were satisfied at this remedy, at the time, the Luxembourgian government was threatened by a [[communist]] insurgency.  After the retreat of the German army, revolutionaries established [[Russian SFSR|Russian]]-influenced [[Workers' council]]s across Luxembourg.  On 10 November, the day after [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] declared a similar '[[socialist republic]]' in Germany, communists in [[Luxembourg City]] declared a republic, but it lasted for only a matter of hours.<ref name = "Kreins 2003 89">Kreins (2003), p. 89.</ref>  Another revolt took place in [[Esch-sur-Alzette]] in the early hours of 11 November, but also failed.<ref name = "Thewes 2003 81">Thewes (2003), p. 81.</ref>  The socialists had been fired up by the behaviour of Grand Duchess Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de, whose interventionist and obstructive streak had stymied even Eyschen.  On 12 November, socialist and liberal politicians, finding their old commonality on the issue, called for her [[abdication]].<ref name = "Dostert 2002 21">Dostert et al. (2002), p. 21.</ref>  A motion in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]] demanding the abolition of the monarchy was defeated by 21 votes to 19 (with 3 abstentions), but the Chamber did demand the government hold a popular [[referendum]] on the issue.<ref name = "Kreins 2003 89" />

Although the left's early attempts at founding a republic had failed, the underlying cause of the resentment had not been addressed, and, as long as Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de was Grand Duchess, the liberals would ally themselves to the socialists in opposition to her.  The French government also refused to cooperate with a government led by a so-called '[[Collaborationism|collaborator]]';<ref name = "Thewes 2003 81" /> French [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Foreign Minister]] [[St<U+00E9>phen Pichon]] called cooperation 'a grave compromise with the enemies of France'.<ref name = "Kreins 2003 89" />  More pressing than either of these troubles, on 9 January, a [[Company (military unit)|company]] of the Luxembourgian army rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic,<ref name = "Thewes 2003 81" /> with [[<U+00C9>mile Servais]] (the son of [[Emmanuel Servais]]) as 'Chairman of the Committee of Public Safety'.<ref>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Luxembourg.htm Luxembourg country profile].  WorldStatesman.org.  Retrieved on 2006-07-23.</ref>  However, by January, the vacuum left by the German withdrawal had been filled by American and French soldiers.  [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|President of the Chamber]] [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Altwies]] asked French troops to intervene.<ref>Kreins (2003), p. 90.</ref>  Eager to put an end to what it perceived to be pro-Belgian revolutions, the French army crushed the would-be revolutionaries.

Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de, who abdicated in favour of her sister, [[Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Charlotte]].<ref name = "Dostert 2002 21" />  [[Belgium]], which had hoped to either annex Luxembourg or force it into [[personal union]], grudgingly recognised Charlotte on 13 February.<ref name = "Kreins 2003 91">Kreins (2003), p. 91.</ref>  The dynasty's hold on power would be tenuous until September 1919, when a referendum on the future of the Grand Duchy found 77.8% in favour of continued rule by the [[House of Nassau-Weilburg]].<ref>Dostert et al.

=== Paris Peace Conference ===
{{Main|Paris Peace Conference, 1919}}
Despite the armistice ending the war, and the end of the revolts, Luxembourg's own future was still uncertain.  Belgium was one of the countries hit hardest by the war; almost the whole of the country was occupied by Germany, and over 43,000 Belgians,<ref>{{cite book | first=Susan | last=Everett | year=1982 | title=History of World War I | edition= | publisher=Simon and Schuster | location=New York | id= | page=248 }}</ref> including 30,000 civilians,<ref>{{cite book | first=Spencer | last=Tucker | year=1999 | title=The European Powers in the First World War: An Encyclopedia | edition=First edition | publisher=Garland | location=New York | pages=172<U+2013>4 | isbn=0-8153-3351-X }}</ref> had died as a result.  Belgium sought compensation, and had its eye on any and all of its neighbours; in November 1918, [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]], the [[Permanent Secretary]] at the [[Foreign Office]], told the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ambassador in [[London]], "The Belgians are on the make, and they want to grab whatever they can."<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Belien | year=2006 | title=A Throne in Brussels | edition= | publisher=Imprint Academic | location= Exeter | isbn=1-84540-065-8 | page=175 }}</ref>

[[Image:Treaty of Versailles Signing, Hall of Mirrors.jpg|thumb|left|Delegates signing the [[Treaty of Versailles]], ending the First World War and cementing Luxembourg's independence.]]  From early 1919, Belgium engaged in a [[propaganda]] campaign to promote its vision of annexation.<ref name = "Kreins 2003 91" />  At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the Belgian delegation argued in favour of the [[international community]] allowing Belgium to annex Luxembourg.<ref name="Richard Doody" />  However, fearing loss of influence over the left bank of the [[Rhine]], France rejected Belgium's overtures out of hand, thus guaranteeing Luxembourg's continued independence.

The resulting [[Treaty of Versailles]] set aside two articles (<U+00A7>40 and <U+00A7>41) to address concerns for  Luxembourg's status.  The main article, <U+00A7>40, revoked all special privileges that Germany had acquired in Luxembourg, with Germany specifically renouncing advantages gained in the treaties of 1842, 1847, 1865, 1866, February 1867, [[Treaty of London, 1867|May 1867]], [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|1871]], 1872, and 1902.<ref>[http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/text/versaillestreaty/all440.html Treaty of Versailles], Article 40.  28 June 1919.  Retrieved on 2006-07-23.</ref>  The effects of these treaties' revocation were then explicitly stated; Luxembourg would withdraw from the ''Zollverein'', Germany would lose its right to use the Luxembourgian railways, and Germany was obligated to recognise the termination of Luxembourg's neutrality, thus validating the actions of the Luxembourgian government since the armistice.  Furthermore, to prevent economic [[embargo]] after the end of the customs union, the treaty allowed Luxembourg an indefinite option on German [[coal]],<ref>Treaty of Versailles, Annex V(5), 28 June 1919</ref> and prohibited Germany from levying [[Customs (tax)|duty]] on Luxembourgian exports until 1924.<ref>Treaty of Versailles, Article 268(c), 28 June 1919</ref>

== Luxembourgers overseas ==
[[Image:G<U+00EB>lle Fra whole 1.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[G<U+00EB>lle Fra]] monument commemorates the thousands of Luxembourgers that volunteered for service in the armed forces of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].]]
Thousands of Luxembourgers overseas, unconstrained by the Luxembourgian government's need to remain neutral, signed up to serve with foreign armies.  3,700 Luxembourgian nationals served in the [[French Army]], of whom over 2,000 died.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/virtualmuseumtour.php#b2 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080609090841/http://www.nat-military-museum.lu/pageshtml/virtualmuseumtour.php#4A |archivedate=2008-06-09 |title=Grand Duchy of Luxembourg |accessdate=20 December 2008 |work= |publisher=[[National Museum of Military History (Luxembourg)|National Museum of Military History]] |date=}}</ref>  As Luxembourg's pre-war population was only 266,000,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.library.uu.nl/wesp/populstat/Europe/luxembgc.htm | title = Luxembourg: Country population | accessdate = 2006-07-23 | author = Jan Lahmeyer | last = Lahmeyer | first = Jan }}</ref> the loss of life solely in the service of the French army amounted to almost 1% of the entire Luxembourgian population, relatively greater than the totals for many combatant countries (see: ''[[World War I casualties]]'').  The Luxembourgian volunteers are commemorated by the [[G<U+00EB>lle Fra]] (literally '' 'Golden Lady' '') [[war memorial]], which was unveiled in Luxembourg City on 27 May 1923.  The original memorial was destroyed on 20 October 1940, during the [[German occupation of Luxembourg in World War II|Nazi occupation]], as it symbolised the rejection of German identity and active resistance against [[Germanisation]].  After [[World War II]], it was gradually rebuilt, culminating in its second unveiling, on 23 June 1985.<ref>{{cite book | first=Josy | last=Braun | year=2000 | title=Queesch derduerch | edition= | publisher=Editions Phi | location=Luxembourg City | pages=129<U+2013>134 | isbn=3-88865-192-1 }}</ref>

The [[Luxembourg American|Luxembourgian community]] in the [[United States]] found itself confronted  by a [[Identity crisis (psychology)|crisis of identity]].  Traditionally, they had identified themselves as ethnically [[German people|German]], rather than as a separate community of their own.<ref name="The Demise of the Luxemburger Gazette">{{cite web | url = http://www.luxamcc.org/id33.html | title = The Demise of the Luxemburger Gazette | accessdate = 2006-07-23 | author = Fasto Gardini | last = Gardini | first = Fausto |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060208223649/http://www.luxamcc.org/id33.html|archivedate=2006-02-08}}</ref>  As such, they read [[German language]] newspapers, attended German schools, and lived amongst [[German American]]s.  Nonetheless, when it became apparent that the war would not be over quickly, the opinions of Luxembourg Americans changed; on 2 May 1915, the Luxemburger Brotherhood of America's annual convention decided to adopt [[English language|English]] as its only official language.<ref name="The Demise of the Luxemburger Gazette" />  Other organisations were less inclined to change their ways; the ''Luxemburger Gazette'' opposed [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s supposed 'favouritism' towards the United Kingdom as late in the war as 1917.<ref name="The Demise of the Luxemburger Gazette" />  However, when the United States entered the war in April of that year, the wavering members of the community supported the Allies, changing forever the relationship between the German and Luxembourgian communities in the USA.
