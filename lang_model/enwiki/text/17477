'''Robert Matthew Van Winkle''' (born October 31, 1967), best known by his [[stage name]] '''Vanilla Ice''', is an American [[rapping|rapper]] and home improvement television personality. Born in [[Dallas, Texas]], and raised in Texas and [[South Florida]], Van Winkle released his debut album, ''Hooked'', in 1989 through [[Ichiban Records]], before signing a contract with [[SBK Records]], a [[record label]] of the [[EMI Group]] that was founded in 1988 which released a reformatted version of the album under the title ''[[To the Extreme]]''. Van Winkle's single "[[Ice Ice Baby]]" was the first hip hop single to top the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts|charts]].

Although Van Winkle was successful, he later regretted his business arrangements with SBK, which had paid him to adopt a more commercial appearance and had published fabricated biographical information without his knowledge. After surviving a [[suicide]] attempt, Van Winkle was inspired to change his musical style and lifestyle. While later albums by Van Winkle haven't charted or featured much radio airplay because of their less mainstream, [[rock music|rock]]-oriented sound, Vanilla Ice has a loyal underground following. His return to music in 1998, ''[[Hard to Swallow]]'' went Gold while his other releases ''[[Bi-Polar (Vanilla Ice album)|Bi-Polar]]'' and ''[[Platinum Underground]]'' have done well. In 2009, Van Winkle began hosting ''[[The Vanilla Ice Project]]'' on [[DIY Network]]. His latest album ''[[WTF (album)|WTF]]'' is set to be released sometime in 2011.

==Career==
===Early career (1985-1989)===
In 1985, Van Winkle was focusing all of his energy on motorcross, winning three straight titles at the Grand National Championships in Dallas. After breaking his ankle during a race, Van Winkle was not interested in racing professionally for some time, using his spare time to perfect his dance moves and creating his own while his ankle was healing. Van Winkle used his beatboxing and breakdancing skills as a street performer with his friends at local malls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roctober.com/roctober/greatness/vanilla.html|title=Vanilla Ice: The Ice Is Right|accessdate=2011-05-05|last=Austin|first=Jake|date=October 24, 1999|publisher=''Roctober''}}</ref>  One evening he visited City Lights, a Dallas night club, where he was dared to go on stage by his friend Squirrel. He won the crowd over and was asked by local disc jockey Floyd 'Earthquake' Brown if he wanted to perform regularly which he accepted. Earthquake would sometimes be joined by Ice's own disc jockeys D-Shay and Zero. Ice's breakdance group named itself 'The V.I.P.' (the Vanilla Ice Posse) and performed with him on stage.<ref name="Vontz"/> As a performer for City Lights, Ice opened up for [[N.W.A]] and MC Hammer.

In 1987, Van Winkle met the owner of City Lights, Tommy Quon.<ref name="Newsmakers">{{cite book|editor=Mooney, Louise|title=Newsmakers: The People Behind Today's Headlines|edition=1991|publisher=Gale Group|isbn=0-8103-7344-0|page=442|year= 1991}}</ref> Upon seeing Van Winkle's performance, Quon saw commercial potential in his rapping and dancing skills, and offered him a contract with his management company, Ultrax.<ref name="Mooney"/><ref name="McVea">{{cite news|first=Denise|last=McVea|title=The Hip-Hop Hustle|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1996-09-05/news/the-hip-hop-hustle/2|publisher=''[[Dallas Observer]]''|page=2|date=September 5, 1996|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> Recording songs that had been perfected on stage by Ice and his acquaintances with various producers, the two year production was released by independent record company [[Ichiban Records]].

Following the success of "Ice Ice Baby", [[record producer]] [[Suge Knight]] and two bodyguards arrived at [[The Palm (restaurant)|The Palm]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], where Van Winkle was eating. After shoving Van Winkle's bodyguards aside, Knight and his own bodyguards sat down in front of Van Winkle, staring at him before finally asking "How you doin'?"<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite book|last1=Sullivan|first1=Randall|title=LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., the Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight, and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal|year=2003|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3971-X|page=56}}</ref> Similar incidents were repeated on several occasions. Eventually, Knight showed up at Van Winkle's hotel suite on the fifteenth floor of the Bel Age Hotel, accompanied by a member of the [[Oakland Raiders]].<ref name="Sullivan"/> According to Van Winkle, Knight took him out on the balcony by himself, and implied that he would throw him off the balcony unless he signed the rights to the song over to Knight; Knight used Van Winkle's money to help fund [[Death Row Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vanillaice/articles/story/5921192/to_the_extreme_and_back|title=To The Extreme and Back|accessdate=November 14, 2008|last=Fischer|first=Blair R.|date=March 12, 1998|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''}}</ref>

===Mainstream success (1990<U+2013>1992)===
On the basis of Van Winkle's good looks and dance moves, [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] tried to convince their producer, [[The Bomb Squad|Hank Shocklee]], to sign Van Winkle to [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]],<ref>http://www.allrovi.com/name/vanilla-ice-mn0000262445</ref> but Van Winkle later signed a contract with [[SBK Records]] in 1990.

SBK Record executive [[Monte Lipman]] stated that he received calls from radio stations reporting over 200 phone calls requesting Ice Ice Baby. SBK wanted Ice on the road as soon as possible. [[MC Hammer]], an old acquaintance from his club days, had Ice on as an opening act on his tour.

{{Bquote
|Ice's mic technique is actually stronger and more nimble than [[MC Hammer]]'s, and he really tries earnestly to show off the skills he does have. Unfortunately, even if he can keep a mid-tempo pace, his flow is rhythmically stiff, and his voice has an odd timbre; plus, he never seems sure of the proper accent to adopt. He's able to overcome those flaws somewhat in isolated moments, but they become all too apparent over the course of an entire album.<ref name="Huey"/>}}

In late 1990, Van Winkle began an eight-month relationship with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and appeared in photographs for her book, ''[[Sex (book)|Sex]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/madonnamen.htm|title=Crazy for Madonna's men|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|accessdate=2009-03-13 | date=December 19, 2000}}</ref><ref name="EntertainmentWeekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,578492,00.html|title=Stupid Questions|accessdate=2009-02-13|date=January 23, 2004|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref> In the height of Van Winkle's popularity, SBK licensed a 12" doll which was made by THQ. In January 1991, he was the musical guest on [[Saturday Night Live]]. Van Winkle branched out into the film industry with an appearance in the film ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', which he later called "one of the coolest experiences" of his career.<ref name="Mooney"/> Van Winkle was very secretive about his personal life, with the intention of protecting his family. In an attempt to rectify this, his former label wrote a fake biography in his name and tried to pass it off as his official life story without his knowledge. While on tour in 1991, Van Winkle found out that SBK had instigated the publication of the biography which detailed false biographical information, including claims that he had attended school with [[Luther Campbell]], and that Van Winkle had grown up in the ghettos of [[Miami]]. Van Winkle later wrote his own book in order to set things straight and debunk the claims SBK were making.<ref name="Atria">{{cite news |title=Vanilla Ice back with a brand new invention |first=Travis |last=Atria |url=http://www.ocala.com/article/20100407/ARTICLES/4081005/1016/ENTERTAINMENT?p=1&tc=pg |agency= |newspaper=[[Star-Banner]] |location=Ocala, Florida |date=April 7, 2010 |pages=2<U+2013>3 }}</ref>

Van Winkle's second major release was the [[live album]] ''[[Extremely Live]]'', released in March 1991.

According to Browne, ''Extremely Live'' "affords you the chance to hear inane stage patter [...] and unaccompanied drumming, during which, one assumes, Ice and his posse are onstage dancing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,314929,00.html|title=Review of ''Extremely Live''|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Browne|first=David|date=July 26, 1991|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref> Monte Lipman later stated that SBK only released the live disc to make more money from Ice's fame.

In late 1991, Ice appeared in the Circus of the Stars and Sideshow, driving his motorcycle through a wall of fire. While his fame in the United States had severely dropped, Ice continued touring South America and Eastern Europe to sold out crowds in 1992. Van Winkle also served as a spokesperson for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Coca-Cola]] throughout 1991 and 1992.

===Fall from fame (1993<U+2013>1996)===
In late 1991, Ice had started production on his second album, at the time titled ''Ice Capades'', premiering some of his songs like ''Road to my Riches'' on the ''Extremely Live'' album. While he was touring in Acapulco, Ice premiered ''The Wrath'', a response song to [[3rd Bass]]. But by 1993, most members of the V.I.P. (Vanilla Ice Posse) had gone their separate ways, including Ice's disc jockey Earthquake. Ice's hype man and second disc jockey Zero, became Ice's DJ full time. By this time, 'Ice Capades' had pretty much been scrapped, but Van Winkle was interested in creating a new CD as he had written some response songs to [[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]]. Zero would help create new beats to songs that Van Winkle had already written for his live tours such as 'The Wrath' as Van Winkle was interested in distancing himself from the image that SBK was trying to create for him. In 1993, Ice toured Eastern-Europe again and premiered songs off his upcoming album, including ''Now & Forever'' in [[Russia]] and ''Iceman Path''. During months of non-stop touring, Van Winkle and the remaining back-up dancers smoked [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] regularly after a show.

By 1994, Van Winkle, who had received less publicity and become removed from the public spotlight, grew [[dreadlocks]].<ref name="Pearlman">{{cite journal|last=Pearlman|first=Jeff|date=May 12, 2003|title=Ice Shift|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/siadventure/27/ice_shift/ | work=CNN}}</ref> On March 22, 1994, Van Winkle released his second studio album, ''[[Mind Blowin]]''.

In 1995, Van Winkle set up a recording studio in Miami and joined a [[grunge]] band, Picking Scabs.<ref name="Peisner"/> Van Winkle expressed an interest in performing hip hop-influenced rock music, but found that the band was unable to produce the sound he was looking for.

After the release of ''Bi-Polar'', Van Winkle left Sony-Universal to be with Ultrax full time. With Quon back as manager, Van Winkle was scheduled to appear in various reality TV programs.

From January to February 2004, Van Winkle appeared on the [[reality television]] series ''[[The Surreal Life]]''.<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> Although much of the series was staged, Van Winkle found the experience to be therapeutic, stating that a comment made by [[Tammy Faye Messner]] during filming; "We are who we are because of who we were" helped him accept his past.<ref name="Atria"/> After filming 'Surreal Life', Van Winkle co-starred in the drug comedy ''[[The Helix...Loaded]]'', an independent film parodying ''[[The Matrix]]'' and other movies made in the late 90's/early 00's.

On August 2, 2005, Van Winkle released his fifth studio album, ''[[Platinum Underground]]''. Van Winkle stated that the title of the album reflected the fact that he could maintain a fanbase without mainstream airplay.<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> [[Allrovi]] reviewer Rob Theakston panned the album, writing that it "has more bad spots in it than most".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allrovi.com/music/album/platinum-underground-mw0000307135|title=Review of ''Platinum Underground''|accessdate=2009-02-25|last=Theakston|first=Rob|publisher=[[Allrovi]]}}</ref> The album featured the song "Survivor" which had premiered on an NBC special produced in the UK entitled ''Hit Me Baby One More Time''. Songs like ''Trailer Park Mullet Wars'' and ''Step Up or Shut Up'' were a hybrid mix of different [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sounds, while ''Say Goodbye'' and ''Bounce'' were new school hip hop. The rest of the album featured mixes of [[Horrorcore]], [[Reggae]] and [[Hardcore hip hop]]. After getting requests to do Ninja Rap live, Ice decided to make a song entitled ''Ninja Rap 2'' (also known as ''Go Ninja Go'') which was set to be a hardcore remix. Despite the name, the song has very little connections to Van Vinkle's original 1991 single, but rather stays true to Ice's current lyricism, where Ice talks about his appreciation to his fans, his love to perform at clubs and playing at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] with [[Insane Clown Posse]]. ''Ninja Rap 2'' was the first song to be released from ''Platinum Underground'' and was available to download for free off of Ice's official website.

Van Winkle admitted to pulling hair from her head to prevent her from jumping out of the truck's window.<ref>{{cite news|title=Vanilla Ice Arrested|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/05/entertainment/main261932.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|location=Davie, Florida|date=January 5, 2001|accessdate=March 26, 2009}}</ref> He pleaded guilty to charges of disorderly conduct four months later, and was sentenced to probation and ordered to attend [[family therapy]] sessions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rapper Vanilla Ice arrested for assaulting wife <nowiki>'for second time'</nowiki>|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-558929/Rapper-Vanilla-Ice-arrested-assaulting-wife-second-time.html|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]''|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=March 26, 2009}}</ref> 

On April 10, 2008, Van Winkle was arrested in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for allegedly kicking and hitting his wife.<ref name="Finn"/> He was released the following day after she declared that her husband had only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument.<ref name="Finn"/> Van Winkle was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him.

==Style, influences and legacy==
[[File:Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer.jpg|thumb|right|[[MC Hammer]] performing with Vanilla Ice in July 2009.]]
Van Winkle's current live performances feature a mix of newer, rock-influenced material and [[old school hip hop]].<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> Van Winkle performs with a live drummer and DJ,<ref>{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Reavy|title=Hyped Hammer/Ice show a hit with Utah fans|url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,705288347,00.html|publisher=''[[Deseret News]]''|date=March 2, 2009|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref> and sometimes sprays his audience with bottled water.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ki-Min|last=Sung|title=Vanilla Ice caps a crazy evening|publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''|date=June 15, 2006|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}</ref> Van Winkle's performances often feature an inflatable grim reaper balloon, a dancer in a clown mask, and confetti thrown into the audience.<ref name="Mooney"/> Describing his performances, Van Winkle stated "It's high energy, stage diving, pyrotechnics, girls showing their breasts. It's crazy party atmosphere."<ref name="WashingtonPost"/>

Van Winkle stated that his musical style was influenced by [[underground music]], rather than mainstream music, and that his influences included hip hop and [[funk]] artists such as [[Funkadelic]], [[Rick James]] and [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]].<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> Van Winkle also stated that he enjoys [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[System of a Down]].<ref name="WashingtonPost"/> Van Winkle sometimes plays [[bass guitar|bass]], [[drum kit|drums]] and [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] on studio recordings.<ref name="Vontz"/> Rapper G-Child, best known for her appearance on ''[[ego trip's The (White) Rapper Show]]'', has credited Van Winkle as being a major influence on her work.<ref name="Lauer-Williams">{{cite news|first=Kathy|last=Lauer-Williams|title=Petite Allentown rapper seeks big break on VH1 show.|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30434280_ITM|publisher=''[[The Morning Call]]''|date=Jan 6, 2007|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> After meeting Van Winkle in 2000, G-Child performed [[freestyle rap]]s at six of Van Winkle's performances, and opened for him four times.<ref name="Lauer-Williams"/> DJ Buzz Fuzz sampled Vanilla Ice's vocals from his 1988 song "Ice is Working It" in his song "The Intro Killer". ''Ice is Working It'' was also featured in the film [[Little Black Book]].

Along with [[Beastie Boys]], [[3rd Bass]] and [[House of Pain]], Van Winkle was one of the earliest white rappers to attain major success.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Erica |title=White on both sides |journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=77 |date=Feb 2002 |issn=10704701 }}</ref> [[Chuck D]] has credited Van Winkle as a regional breakthrough, stating "He broke through in the mid-South, in a Southern area in Texas, in something that was kind of indigenous to that hip-hop culture down there. He just doesn<U+2019>t get credit for it."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morse |first=Nathan |date=April 20, 2009 |title=Public Enemy: The Rolling Stones of the Rap Game |journal=[[L.A. Record]] |url=http://larecord.com/interviews/2009/04/20/public-enemy-the-rolling-stones-of-the-rap-game/ }}</ref> Vanilla Ice was one of the first rappers to gain worldwide fame and recognition and the first Caucasian rapper to reach the Billboard 100 (first at no. 4, then at no. 1). As a result of his success, Van Winkle was the subject of criticism from other hip hop musicians. After Van Winkle's early success on radio, Chuck D remembers "When ["Ice, Ice, Baby"] came out, black people liked it until they found out he was white, and three years later, no one would admit to buying his record." 
In 1991, 3rd Bass released a single called "[[Pop Goes the Weasel (3rd Bass song)|Pop Goes the Weasel]]", and in the lyrics comparing Van Winkle unfavorably to [[Elvis Presley]]. The song's music video featured [[Henry Rollins]] as Van Winkle, who is depicted as being assaulted by 3rd Bass.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hess|first=Mickey|title=Is Hip Hop Dead?|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-99461-9|pages=117<U+2013>118|chapter=White Rappers}}</ref> [[Del tha Funkee Homosapien]] referred to Van Winkle in the lyrics of "Pissin' on Your Steps", which appeared on his 1991 debut album ''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''. Similar to 'Pop Goes the Weasel', the song negatively makes a connection between Van Winkle and Elvis, while saying Ice alongside MC Hammer are mocking hip hop by being commercial.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perkins|first1=William Eric|title=Droppin' Science: Critical Essays on Rap Music and Hip Hop Culture|year=1996|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=1-56639-362-0|page=37|chapter=The rap attack}}</ref> Van Winkle responded to "Pop Goes the Weasel" with his 1992 song "The Wrath" and to many of his other critics by stating that they were simply jealous of his early success. He repeated a message to his critics on the Arsenio Hall show telling the critics who thought he would never make it that they could "kiss [his] white ass."

In the intro on [[De La Soul]]'s album ''[[De La Soul Is Dead]]'', Ice's dance moves are complimented. In the 1992 song "Scenario" by [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Phife Dawg]] expresses unbelievability over Ice's Platinum status. While some business decisions with SBK hurt Van Winkle's reputation in the States, he continued to remain a very sought after personality in [[Europe]]. He was the first rapper to perform in [[China]] and the first Indian hip hop song, "Thanda Thanda Pani" (Cold Cold Water) by [[Baba Sehgal]] was inspired heavily by Vanilla Ice's music and style. [[New Line Cinema]] had written a role specially for Van Winkle in ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'', but scheduling conflicts with Van Winkle's To The Extreme Tour forced the role to be scrapped from the script. [[Michael Bay]], who had directed Van Winkle in his music video for "I Love You", planned to have the rapper appear in a cameo in the 2007 film ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' but Van Winkle was busy touring. Robert Van Winkle appears as a video game character in ''Championship Motocross'' released in 2001 on [[PlayStation 2]]. ''Ice Ice Baby'' and ''Havin a Roni'' are featured in the video game ''[[DJ Hero]]''.

Vanilla Ice has been referenced in various Hollywood films and television shows. In ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'', Vanilla Ice is seen frozen next to Powers in the cryogenic laboratory. [[Vince Vaughn]]'s character in ''[[Be Cool]]'' was loosely based on Vanilla Ice, even parodying the urban myth that Ice was hung upside down over a hotel balcony. In the 2008 film ''[[Step Brothers (film)|Step Brothers]]'', [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott's]] character wins a high school talent show by dancing and lip syncing to "Ice Ice Baby". [[Seth Green]] voiced Vanilla Ice in an episode of ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where the cast of Surreal Life go to [[Middle-earth]] from [[The Lord of the Rings]] where Ice is squashed by an [[Ent]]. In the season two premier of ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', ''[[Harder, Better, Faster, Browner]]'', Kenny West (voiced by [[Kanye West]]) works at a rap-themed restaurant which features a mechanical Vanilla Ice as an attraction. In the last episode of season 4 of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', Raj sings "Ice Ice Baby". He was parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' portrayed by [[Kevin Bacon]] where [[Chris Rock]] as Nathan X wonders how a white man dances so well. [[Jim Carrey]] parodied Vanilla Ice in one of his most known sketches on ''[[In Living Color]]''. Carrey dances again to "Ice Ice Baby" in the 2011 movie ''[[Mr. Popper's Penguins (film)|Mr. Popper's Penguins]]''.

[[Eminem]] has often name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles he did with rapper [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] in 1992 where they performed against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single "[[Just Don't Give a Fuck]]", Eminem mentions Ice alongside [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]], boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Van Winkle responded to in a magazine interview with ''Vibe'' saying that Eminem "raps like a girl".<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=June 1999 |title=13 Ways Of Looking At A Whiteboy |journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |page=120 |publisher= |doi= |issn=1070-4701 |accessdate= }}</ref> While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song "Marshall Mathers" which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song "[[Purple Pills]]" in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album ''[[Bi-Polar (Vanilla Ice album)|Bi-Polar]]'', Ice mentions Eminem in a positive light ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Van Winkle stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say "I give him credit, I think he<U+2019>s talented, I think he<U+2019>s a killer rapper, you know I don<U+2019>t compare myself to him because he<U+2019>s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don<U+2019>t colorize hip hop, it<U+2019>s stupid, but for people who are doing that are just looking through the eyes of a racial standpoint, and it really shouldn<U+2019>t be looked at that way, you<U+2019>re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don<U+2019>t need to compare us two. Following me, any white rapper is going to have to hear <U+201C>oh, you think you<U+2019>re Vanilla Ice?<U+201D>, so I am sure he<U+2019>s heard that." <ref name="Jason Joseph">{{cite news|title=Throwback Interview: Vanilla Ice.|url=http://www.shockblastmedia.com/2010/08/throwback-interview-vanilla-ice/|publisher=''Shockblast Media''|date=2002|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>
In 2002, Eminem mentions Ice again on [[The Eminem Show]] and in the film [[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]. In the 2011 song [[Fast Lane (song)|Fast Lane]], Eminem raps about riding in his car while listening to ''Ice Ice Baby''.

In March 2009, Van Winkle participated in a [[Virgin Mobile]] advertising campaign titled "Right Music Wrongs", apologizing for his 1990s image.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Australian Associated Press]]|title=Vanilla Ice headed Down Under|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/music/vanilla-ice-headed-down-under/2009/03/16/1237054704160.html|publisher=''[[The Age]]''|location=[[Melbourne]]|date=March 16, 2009|accessdate=March 18, 2009}}</ref> As part of the campaign, Van Winkle was placed on "trial", and was voted innocent by users of the campaign website.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Australian Associated Press]]|title=Singer found not guilty of crimes against music|publisher=''[[Herald Sun]]''|location=[[Melbourne]]|date=March 28, 2009|accessdate=March 28, 2009}}</ref> He also appeared in a commercial for the South African [[Light beer#Light beer|light beer]] [[Castle Lager#Castle brewery|Castle Lite]].<ref name="Mooney"/> In 2010, Vanilla Ice was featured on the debut single of the Irish duo [[John & Edward]], a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of "[[Under Pressure]]" and "[[Ice Ice Baby]]".<ref>{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=O'Brien |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/2805549/Jedward-will-team-up-with-rapper-Vanilla-Ice-for-their-debut-single.html|title =Jedward will team up with rapper Vanilla Ice for their new debut single |newspaper=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] |date=January 13, 2010 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> "[[Under Pressure (Ice Ice Baby)]]" was released in the United Kingdom on January 31, 2010 via download and as a physical single on February 15, 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=John & Edward confirm debut single |first=Mayer |last=Nissim |publisher=Digital Spy |date=January 21, 2010 |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a198128/john--edward-confirm-debut-single.html |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref>
