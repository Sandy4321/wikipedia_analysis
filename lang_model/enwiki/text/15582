'''Shibden Hall''' is a historic hall in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] dating back to around [[1420]], when it was recorded as being inhabited by one William Oates.  For three hundred years it was in the hands of the Lister family (c. 1615-1826).  Its most famous resident was [[Anne Lister]] (1791-1840), who became sole owner of the hall after the death of her aunt.  It is currently open to the public, with the Yorkshire Folk Museum adjoining.  

The hall has been extensively modified from its original design by generations of residents, although its [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] half timbered frontage remains its most recognisable feature.
