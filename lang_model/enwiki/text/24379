'''Mount Douglas''' is a [[stratovolcano]] located south of [[Kamishak Bay]], near the northeasternmost part of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. It lies in the [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] in [[Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska|Kenai Peninsula Borough]]. The mountain was officially named in 1906 after nearby [[Cape Douglas (Alaska)|Cape Douglas]] based on a 1904 report by USGS geologist G. C. Martin. The [[Alaska Volcano Observatory]] currently rates Douglas as [[Level of Concern Color Code]] Not Assigned. 

The volcano has a warm and highly acidic [[crater lake]] approximately 160&nbsp;m (525&nbsp;ft) wide. In 1992, the lake had a temperature of 21<U+00B0>C and a [[pH]] of 1.1. At the north flank of the volcano unglaciated and relatively uneroded lava flows are found. The last eruption was considered to have occurred during the [[Holocene]] (Nye et al.,1998).
