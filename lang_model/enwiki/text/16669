'''Sri Temasek''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: <U+65AF><U+91CC><U+6DE1><U+9A6C><U+9521>) is a two-storey [[single-family detached home|detached house]] built in 1869 which is sited within the grounds of the [[Istana Singapore|Istana]] in [[Singapore]]. During the island's colonial era, it served as the residence of the [[Chief Secretary|Colonial Secretary]]. Since Singapore's independence in 1965, it has been the official residence of the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], though none of Singapore's Prime Ministers has ever lived there. Together with the Istana, it was gazetted a [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monument]] on 14 February 1992.

==Name==
The name of the house, Sri Temasek, means "splendour of Temasek" in the [[Malay language]]. The Malay word ''seri'' or ''sri'' means "charm; quintessence; splendour; glory"<ref>{{citation|contribution=seri|editor=R[ichard] J[ames] Wilkinson|title=A Malay<U+2013>English Dictionary (Romanised)|location=London|publisher=Macmillan|year=1955}}.</ref> or a "[[wikt:cynosure|cynosure]]"<ref>{{citation|contribution=seri|editor=Richard [Olaf] Winstedt|title=An Unabridged Malay<U+2013>English Dictionary|edition=5th|location=Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia|publisher=Marican & Sons|year=1963}}.</ref> (something that attracts attention by its brilliancy or beauty; a centre of attraction, interest, or admiration),<ref>{{citation|contribution=cynosure|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50056812|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED Online]]|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1989|accessdate=2008-10-08}}.</ref> and is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word {{Unicode|<U+0938><U+093E><U+0930>}} (''s<U+0101>ra'').<ref>The Sanskrit word {{Unicode|<U+0938><U+093E><U+0930>}} (''s<U+0101>ra'') means "essence, substance; the substantial or essential part of anything; the best or choicest part; the quintessence; the heart; cream, curds, nectar; strength, power, vigour, force, courage, prowess, valour, heroism, firmness, hardness; worth, excellence, highest degree of perfection; wealth, goods, riches": {{citation|contribution={{Unicode|<U+0938><U+093E><U+0930>}}|editor=[[Monier Monier-Williams]]|title=A Sanskrit<U+2013>English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Greek, Latin, Gothic, German, Anglo-Saxon and Other Cognate Indo-European Languages|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]]|year=1872}}.</ref> ''[[Temasek]]'', which means "sea town" in [[Javanese language|Javanese]], was the name of an early city on the site of modern Singapore.

==Design==
The construction of the [[Istana Singapore]] (then called Government House) and Sri Temasek was ordered by the [[List of Governors of the Straits Settlements|Governor]] of the [[Straits Settlements]], Sir [[Harry Ord|Harry St. George Ord]], after the original governor's residence had to be demolished in 1859 to make way for [[Fort Canning]] on the hill that bears its name.<ref name="Frommer's">{{citation|title=The Istana and Sri Temasek|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/singapore/A23790.html|publisher=[[Frommer's]]|accessdate=2008-10-10}}.</ref> Sri Temasek was designed by [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair]] (1829<U+2013>1910), a [[civil engineer]] who was appointed Executive Engineer and Superintendent of Convicts of the Straits Settlements, and built largely using Indian convict labour from [[Bengkulu|Bencoolen]].

A {{convert|1600|m2|sqft|adj=on}} two-storey [[single-family detached home|detached house]] <U+2013> often called a [[bungalow]] in Singapore <U+2013> with European and Asian features, Sri Temasek has a symmetrical layout consisting of deep [[verandah]]s surrounding central living spaces. Notable architectural features include arches on its upper level, an intricate timber arcade with a mixture of eastern and western decorative motifs, and a Chinese [[moon gate]] (a circular gateway) on the building's second floor.<ref name="ST 20081004"/> Although few records exist concerning the moon gate's construction and usage, it is known to have made its appearance in the house in the 1960s and to have been designed and built by William Swaffield, a pre-[[World War II]] Comptroller of Government House and a professional furniture designer. It is constructed of chengal, [[teak]] and [[Shorea|meranti]] wood.<ref>{{citation|title=Architecture|url=http://www.istana.gov.sg/IstanaGrounds/Architecture/|publisher=[[Istana Singapore|Istana Singapore: Office of the President of the Republic of Singapore]]|date=28 April 2006|accessdate=2008-10-08}}.</ref> In the middle of the driveway in front of the house, there is a brick pit that was originally used by horse-drawn carriages.<ref name="ST 20081004"/> The house was gazetted together with the Istana as a [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monument]] on 14 February 1992.<ref>{{citation|title=55 gazetted national monuments of Singapore|url=http://app.mica.gov.sg/Data/0/PDF/1_PMB%20Monuments-2006.pdf|publisher=Preservation of Monuments Board|year=2006|accessdate=2008-10-08}}; {{citation|contribution=Istana and Sri Temasek|editor=Tommy Koh|title=Singapore: The Encyclopedia|location=Singapore|publisher=Editions Didier Millet in association with the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]]|year=2006|isbn=981-4155-63-2|page=259}}.</ref>

As the original hand-crafted timber arches and railings on the first-storey verandah had been damaged by [[termite]]s, replacements moulded from the originals made with an [[aluminium]]-cast [[alloy]] were used. Details on railings, doors and windows were restored, and several ''pintu pagar'' (traditional wooden half-doors) and wooden flooring reinstated. The former servants' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery. The restoration works on Sri Temasek won the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]'s Architectural Heritage Award in Category A (national monuments and fully conserved buildings) in 2008.<ref name="ST 20081004"/>

When first built in 1869, Sri Temasek was the residence of the [[Chief Secretary|Colonial Secretary]] of the Straits Settlements. It is currently designated as the official residence of the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], though none of the past and present holders of the post, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], [[Goh Chok Tong]] and [[Lee Hsien Loong]], have lived in it as a family home.<ref name="ST 20081004"/> In the 1998 book ''Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas'',<ref>{{citation|author=Han Fook Kwang|author2=Warren Fernandez|author3=Sumiko Tan|title=Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas|location=Singapore|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings]] [and] Times Editions|year=1998|isbn=981-204-049-8|authorlink2=Warren Fernandez|authorlink3=Sumiko Tan}}.</ref> Lee Kuan Yew said that when he became Prime Minister in 1959 he and his wife [[Kwa Geok Choo]] decided not to move into Sri Temasek with their three children, who were then aged seven, five and two, because the couple "did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs". The family did stay there in 1965 for a short time for security reasons when Singapore separated from Malaysia. Apart from that, according to a 2000 ''[[The Straits Times|Straits Times]]'' interview with Kwa, the Lee children often played in the grounds of the house in the evening while their father played golf or made use of the practice tee and putting green.<ref name="ST 20080815"/><ref>See also {{citation|title=Lee Kuan Yew's interview with Talk Asia on CNN|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020209c1.htm|publisher=[[CNN]] (archived at Singapore Window)|date=9 February 2002|accessdate=2008-10-10}}. During the interview, Lee said: "My official residence was at Sri Temasek in the Istana grounds where there are butlers and waiters galore. We decided to stay at home and not take the official residence which I used for entertainment purposes because we both believe that if they [our children] had so many waiters and helpers picking balls for them, doing things for them, it will give them an inflated and a false idea of what life would be like."</ref>

Sri Temasek has been used mostly for official functions, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Prominent visitors included [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]] of independent Malaysia; [[Spiro Agnew]], the [[Vice President of the United States]]; [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]]; [[Denis Healey]], British [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]]; and [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein of Jordan]]. Sri Temasek was the venue for a party hosted in 1962 by Lee Kuan Yew to thank trade unionists and civil servants for their help with the referendum on Singapore's merger with Malaysia, and in 1983 the body of the late [[Ministry of Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]] [[Hon Sui Sen]] [[lying in state|lay in state]] there.<ref name="ST 20080815"/> On 8 August 2008, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day message from Sri Temasek for the first time.<ref name="ST 20081004"/><ref>{{citation|author=S.
