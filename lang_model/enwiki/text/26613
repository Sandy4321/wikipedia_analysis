''''Umar ibn Hafs Hazarmard''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0639><U+0645><U+0631> <U+0628><U+0646> <U+062D><U+0641><U+0635> <U+0647><U+0632><U+0627><U+0631><U+0645><U+0631><U+062F>}}) (d. November 27, 771){{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|p=197}} was a member of the [[Muhallabid]] family who served as a provincial governor for the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reigns of [[as-Saffah|Abu al-'Abbas]] (r. 749<U+2013>754) [[al-Mansur]] (r. 754<U+2013>775). His appointment to [[Ifriqiya]] in 768 marked the beginning of nearly three decades of Muhallabid rule there,{{sfn|Kennedy|1981|p=190}} but he was unable to maintain order in the province and was killed during a major [[Kharijite]] rebellion.

== Career ==
'Umar was a supporter of the [[Abbasid Revolution]] and fought during the [[Siege of Wasit]].{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985<U+2013>2007|loc=v. 27: p. 186}} Following the Abbasid victory against the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], he was appointed to a number of governorships. Under Abu al-'Abbas he was governor of [[Basra|al-Basrah]] until 750 and was subsequently appointed to [[Eastern Arabia|al-Bahrayn]].{{sfn|Khalifah ibn Khayyat|1985|pp=412, 413}} Following the ascension of al-Mansur, he was appointed twice more to al-Basrah, from 755 to 757 and from 759 to 760.{{sfn|Khalifah ibn Khayyat|1985|pp=417, 420, 431}}

In 760 'Umar was appointed to [[Sindh|al-Sind]], which was under the control of [['Uyaynah ibn Musa al-Tamimi]]. When the latter refused to relinquish his authority, 'Umar attacked him and besieged him for eleven months, until 'Uyaynah agreed to depart from the region and return to al-Mansur.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985<U+2013>2007|loc=v. 28: p. 78}}{{sfn|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|p=448}}{{sfn|Khalifah ibn Khayyat|1985|pp=420, 433}} While in al-Sind, 'Umar secretly sided with the movement of [[Alid Revolt (762<U+2013>763)|Muhammad the Pure Soul]] and gave assistance to Muhammad's son 'Abdallah when the latter arrived in the region; when al-Mansur became aware of this, he managed to avoid punishment after a member of his household volunteered to take the blame in his place.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985<U+2013>2007|loc=v. 29: pp. 51 ff.}}{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=193-94}}

In 768, following the killing of [[al-Aghlab ibn Salim at-Tamimi]], the governor of Ifriqiya, 'Umar was dismissed from Sind and appointed to that province instead.{{sfn|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|pp=464-65}}{{sfn|Khalifah ibn Khayyat|1985|p=434}} Arriving in [[Kairouan|al-Qayrawan]] with five hundred horsemen, he won over the city leaders by acting generously toward them, and the first three years of his governorship were peaceful.{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|p=195}}

== Kharijite rebellion and death ==
After receiving orders from al-Mansur, 'Umar went to [[Tubunae#Tubunae/Thubunae in Numidia|Tubna]] in order to strengthen its defenses, and left [[Habib ibn Habib al-Muhallabi]] as his deputy in al-Qayrawan. While he was at Tubna, however, the [[Berber people|Berbers]] rose in rebellion, and Habib was killed while attempting to suppress them. Encouraged by their success, the Berbers gathered around [[Tripoli]] and placed themselves under the leadership of the [[Ibadi]] [[Abu Hatim Ya'qub ibn Habib al-Ibadi]]. When the governor of Tripoli requested assistance, 'Umar dispatched an army against the rebels, but Abu Hatim defeated it and forced it to withdraw to [[Gab<U+00E8>s|Qabis]].{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|p=195}}

At this point, the rebellion spread throughout the entire province, and a large Kharijite coalition headed by the [[Sufri]] [[Abu Qurra|Abu Qurra al-Ifrani]], [[Rustamids|'Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam]], Abu Hatim, 'Asim al-Sidrati al-Ibadi and others advanced upon Tubna and placed it under siege. Despite being badly outnumbered by the rebels, 'Umar was able to extricate himself from the situation by bribing Abu Qurra's men to go home and defeating Ibn Rustam in battle. The remaining Kharijite forces under Abu Hatim decided to abandon Tubna and departed for al-Qayrawan, which they surrounded and besieged for eight months.{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=195-96}}{{sfn|Kennedy|1981|pp=190-91}}

'Umar initially remained in Tubna, which he fortified in anticipation of a future attack. News eventually reached him, however, that al-Qayrawan was running critically low on supplies, so he left a garrison in Tubna and advanced against the rebels. The Berbers responded by attacking him en route and forcing him to temporarily withdraw to [[Tunis]], but he was eventually able to make his way into al-Qayrawan, bringing with him food, mounts and other provisions.{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|p=196}}

Following 'Umar's arrival in al-Qayrawan, Abu Hatim returned to set up a new siege of the city, and fighting between the two sides recommenced. As the siege wore on, the situation in the city quickly worsened; food again became scarce and the defenders were forced to eat their animals. 'Umar himself decided to lead a sortie against the rebels, but he was defeated and killed. Following his death, the surviving defenders struck an agreement with Abu Hatim and withdrew to Tubna, allowing the Berbers to storm al-Qawrawan and enter it.{{sfn|Ibn al-Athir|1987|pp=196-97}}{{sfn|Kennedy|1981|p=191}}{{sfn|Al-Ya'qubi|1883|loc=pp. 464-65|ps=, has 'Umar's death occurring in the prior year}}{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1985<U+2013>2007|loc=v. 29: p. 65}}
