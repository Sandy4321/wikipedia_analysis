'''David Halberstam''' ([[April 10]], [[1934]]<U+2013>[[April 23]], [[2007]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[journalist]] and [[author]] known for his early work on the [[Vietnam War]] and his later sports journalism. 

==Life and career==

Halberstam graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a degree in journalism in [[1955]] and started his career writing for the ''Daily Times Leader'' in [[West Point, Mississippi|West Point]], [[Mississippi]]. In the late [[1950s]] and early [[1960s]], writing for ''[[The Tennessean]]'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], he covered the beginnings of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]].

In the mid [[1960s]], Halberstam covered the [[Vietnam War]] for ''[[The New York Times]]''. While there, he gathered material for his book ''The Making of a Quagmire: America and Vietnam during the Kennedy Era''. In 1963, he received a [[George Polk Award]] for his reporting at the ''New York Times''. At the age of 30, he won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his reporting on the war. He is interviewed in the 1968 documentary film on the Vietnam War entitled ''[[In the Year of the Pig]]''.

Halberstam put an enormous effort into his book about Kennedy's foreign policy decisions about the Vietnam War, ''[[The Best and the Brightest]]''.  Synthesizing material from dozens of books and many dozens of interviews, Halberstam focused
on the odd paradox that those who crafted the U.S. war effort in Vietnam were some of the most intelligent, well-connected and self-confident men in America<U+2014>"the best and the brightest"<U+2014>and yet those same men were unable to imagine and promote any but a bloody and disastrous course in the Vietnam War.  

Thousands of readers began ''The Best and the Brightest'' feeling that the U.S. must pursue the war in Vietnam until "victory" was achieved, but became convinced by Halberstam's book that the U.S. could not win and therefore should withdraw from Vietnam.

After publication of ''The Best and the Brightest'' in 1972, Halberstam plunged right into another "big" book and in 1979 published an informative book about some of the major media outlets in America.  ''[[The Powers That Be (book)|The Powers That Be]]'' gave compelling profiles of men like [[William Paley]] of [[CBS]], [[Henry Luce]] of [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]], [[Phil Graham]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]''<U+2014>and many others.

Later in his career, Halberstam turned to the subjects of sports, publishing ''The Breaks of the Game,'' an inside look at the [[Bill Walton]] and the 1978 [[Portland Trailblazers]] basketball team; an ambitious book on [[Michael Jordan]] in [[1999]] called ''[[Playing for Keeps (book)|Playing for Keeps]]''; and on the pennant race battle between the [[Yankees]] and [[Red Sox]] called ''[[Summer of '49]]''.

After publishing two books in the 1960s, Halberstam published three books in the 1970s, four books in the 1980s, and six books in the 1990s.  He published four books in the 2000s and was on a pace to publish six or more books in that decade before his death. In the wake of 9/11, Halberstam wrote perhaps the most sensitive and insightful book about that tragedy, detailing Engine 40, Ladder 35, in the tome, ''Firehouse.''

In 1980, an escaped convict from New York, Bernard C. Welch, Jr., murdered Halberstam's brother, [[Michael J. Halberstam]], a [[Washington, D.C.]] cardiologist.<ref name="welchmurder">Lyons, Richard D. (December 8, 1980). Slaying Suspect A Puzzle to Neighbors; House Was Toured Periods Away From Home Control of Handguns Sought. ''[[New York Times]]''</ref> Halberstam refused to comment publicly about this incident.

==Death==
Halberstam was killed [[April 23]], [[2007]] in a [[traffic accident]] in [[Menlo Park, California]] near the [[Dumbarton Bridge (California)|Dumbarton Bridge]].<ref name=Cot<U+00E9>>
