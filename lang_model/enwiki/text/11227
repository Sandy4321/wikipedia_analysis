Known as the '''mantle pea crab''', '''''Pinnixa faba''''' is a small [[crab]], a [[pea crab]], which lives harmlessly within a large edible [[clam]]. This species is a [[symbiont]] of [[Horse clam|''Tresus capax'']] in its mature stage.  

==Description==
Pea crabs, [[family (biology)|family]] [[Pinnotheridae]], are small crabs that live [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] with [[clam]]s, [[tubeworm]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s, and other fauna.  Usually they feed on the results of their host's filtering, or in the case of sea cucumbers they live in the cloaca feeding off of the results of digestion and reproduction.  They have no rostrum and no teeth between the eyes. <ref>Cowles, D. (2005). ''Pinnixa faba''. Retrieved May 20, 2008, from Walla Walla University, Rosario Beach Web site, http://www.wallawalla.edu/academics/departments/biology/rosario/inverts/Arthropoda/Crustacea/Malacostraca/Eumalacostraca/Eucarida/Decapoda/Brachyura/Family_Pinnotheridae/Pinnixa_faba.html#face</ref>

The carapace can be up to 15 [[millimetre|mm]] wide and 7 mm long.  The carapace and walking legs are often covered in [[seta]]e which can collect the material being filtered by the host.  The species is distinguished by the tips of the dactyls, which are noticeably curved, and by the rounded nature of the outer eye orbits. <ref>Zmarzly, D. L. (1992). Taxonomic review of pea crabs in the genus Pinnixa (Decapoda: Brachyura: Pinnotheridae) Occurring on the California Shelf, with descriptions of two new species. ''Journal of Crustacean Biology, 12(4),'' 677-713. </ref>

==Life History==
''P. faba'' are only known to mate in [[Horse clam|''Tresus capax'']] where somehow juveniles are prevented from maturing until one member of the breeding couple dies or the juvenile finds another host.  In a breeding couple the female will remain in the visceral fold feeding on the materiel filtered by [[Horse clam|''Tresus capax'']] while the male and juveniles roam around the mantle cavity.  Juveniles can be found in most other clams, notably the butter clam, ''[[Saxidomus giganteus]]''. <ref>Zmarzly, D. L. (1992). Taxonomic review of pea crabs in the genus Pinnixa (Decapoda: Brachyura: Pinnotheridae) Occurring on the California Shelf, with descriptions of two new species. ''Journal of Crustacean Biology, 12(4),'' 677-713. </ref>

Some writers consider the relationship of ''P. faba'' with its hosts to be [[commensalism|commensalistic]] while others consider it [[parasite|parasitic]], though it is clear that ''P. faba'''s symbiosis causes minimal if any damage to the host.

==Diet==
''P. faba'' feeds on the filtered organic matter collected by its host.

==Misidentification==
''P. faba'' is indistinguishable from ''[[Pinnixa littoralis]]'' without magnification.  ''P. littoralis'' has a more angular shape to the outer eye orbit while ''P. faba'' does not leave a significant gap when it closes its chelapeds. <ref>Zmarzly, D. L. (1992).

==Range==
''P. faba'' is found among its hosts in the [[intertidal zone|intertidal regions]] of [[Prince of Wales Island, Alaska]] to [[Newport Beach, California]], most common in [[Puget Sound]] <ref>Cowles, D.
