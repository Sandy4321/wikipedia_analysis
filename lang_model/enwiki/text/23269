'''Dwyane Tyrone Wade, Jr.''' (born [[January 17]], [[1982]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[NBA]] [[basketball]] player, currently of the [[Miami Heat]]. His nicknames include '''"Flash"''' and '''"D-Wade"'''. Wade was named 2006 [[Sportsman of the Year]] by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. Despite the unorthodox spelling, Wade's first name is pronounced as ''Dwayne''; often in print media, it is [[misspelling|misspelled]] as such. Wade has become one of the more well-known and popular players in the league. He had the top selling jersey in the NBA for nearly two years, as he led the NBA in jersey sales from the [[2005 NBA playoffs]], until the mid point of the [[2006-07 NBA season]]. <ref name="Dorsch">John Dorschner, [http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/16427592.htm Who's No. 1? Kobe tops Dwyane in jersey sales], MiamiHerald.com, [[January 10]], [[2007]] </ref>

After entering the league with little fanfare as the fifth pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]], Wade has become one of the more accomplished young players in the NBA today. After making the All-Rookie team in his first season, and the All-Star team the following two seasons, he led his team to an NBA Championship in his third pro campaign. Wade was named [[2006]] [[NBA Finals MVP]] as he led the Heat to a 4-2 series win over the Dallas Mavericks.


==Early life==

==College==
Wade played college basketball for [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. In Wade's first year at Marquette he did play because of academic problems.<ref name="draft.net">nbadraft.net, [http://nbadraft.net/profiles/dwyanewade.htm Player Profile: Dwyane Wade], accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]] </ref> When Wade became eligible his sophomore year (2001-2002) he led the Golden Eagles in scoring with 17.8 [[Points per game|ppg]], and also contributed averages of 6.6 rebounds per game and 3.4 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] per game.<ref name="dbbb">databasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=WADEDW01 Dwyane Wade], accessed [[January 28]], [[2007]] </ref> Marquette finished a 26-7 record,<ref name="MQbio">marquette.cstv.com, [http://gomarquette.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/wade_dwyane02.html Dwyane Wade player Bio], accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]] </ref> the school's best record since the 1993-1994 season.<ref name="MQbio"> </ref>  In 2002-03, Wade led Marquette in scoring again with 21.5 [[points per game|ppg]],<ref name="dbbb"> </ref> and Marquette won the school's first and only Conference USA championship with a 27-6 record. Wade then led the Golden Eagles to the [[Final Four]], the school's first appearance in the Final Four since winning the 1977 national championship. After the season Wade was named to the Associated Press All-America Team becoming the first Marquette player since 1978 to do so.<ref name="MQbio"> </ref>

One of Wade's more memorable collegiate moments came in the 2003 Midwest Regional Final in the [[NCAA]] Tournament in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]. Against heavily favored, top-ranked and top-seeded [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky Wildcats]], Wade recorded a [[triple-double]] with 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including 4 [[block (basketball)|blocks]] and a [[steal (basketball)|steal]] on defense.<ref name="nbabio">nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/playerfile/dwyane_wade/bio.html Dwyane Wade Bio], accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]] </ref> His triple double was just the third ever in NCAA Tournament history.<ref name="nbabio">nba.com, [http://www.nba.com/playerfile/dwyane_wade/bio.html Dwyane Wade Bio], accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]] </ref> Wade's accomplishment helped lead Marquette over the Wildcats 83-69 and into the Final Four.  Marquette finished the season ranked #6 in the AP poll, the school's highest ranking since the 1976-1977 season. Wade's strong play in the tournament caused his [[NBA Draft|draft]] stock to increase significantly.<ref>signonsandiego.com, [http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/college_basketball/20030501-1454-bkc-wade-nbadraft.html Dwyane Wade to enter NBA draft (AP report)], accessed [[January 29]], [[2007]] </ref> As a result, he elected to enter the 2003 NBA draft and forgo his senior year at Marquette.

On [[February 3]], [[2007]], nearly three and a half years after his final collegiate game, Marquette retired Wade's jersey at halftime of their game against [[Providence College|Providence]]. Although Marquette requires student-athletes to graduate prior to receiving jersey retirement honors, the University has made special exception for Wade based on his accomplishments since leaving Marquette.<ref name="jersey">cstv.com, [http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/stories/092906aaf.html Marquette to Retire Dwyane Wade's No. 3 Jersey], accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]] </ref>

==NBA career==
===Rookie season===
Selected fifth overall in the [[2003 NBA Draft]] by the [[Miami Heat]], Wade quickly emerged as a solid player on a relatively young Miami Heat team and averaged 16.2 points on 46.5% [[Field goal percentage|shooting]] to go along with averages of 4.0 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game in his rookie season.<ref name="dbbb"> </ref> After a slow 5-15 start,<ref>databasebasketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=MIA&yr=2003&lg=N Miami Heat  2003-04 Game Log and Scores], accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]] </ref> the Heat would gradually improve to finish 42-40 and [[2004 NBA Playoffs|make the playoffs]].<ref name="dbbb Heat">databasebaketball.com, [http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teampage.htm?tm=MIA&lg=N Miami Heat team page], accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]] </ref> He further distinguished himself with outstanding performances in the playoffs,<ref name="nbabio"> </ref> particularly against the [[Indiana Pacers]] in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Semi-finals. In the end, however, Wade's successful rookie season was somewhat overshadowed by the hype surrounding fellow rookies [[Carmelo Anthony]] and, in particular, [[LeBron James]]. Wade did earn unanimous selection to the NBA 2004 All-Rookie team,<ref name="nbabio"> </ref> and also finished third in rookie of the year voting (behind James and Anthony).<ref name="nbabio"> </ref> He also ranked in the top five among rookies in several major statistical categories, including second in field goal percentage, second in steals, third in scoring, fourth in assists, and fourth in minutes played.<ref name="nbabio"> </ref>

===2006-07===
In the [[2006-07 NBA season]], Wade was elected to his third straight [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]].
