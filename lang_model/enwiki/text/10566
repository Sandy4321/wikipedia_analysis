'''Cupronickel''' is an [[alloy]] of [[copper]], [[nickel]] and strengthening impurities, such as [[iron]] and [[manganese]]. 

Cupronickel does not corrode in seawater, because its [[electronegativity]] is adjusted to be neutral with regard to [[seawater]]. Because of this it is used for marine hardware, and sometimes for the propellers, crankshafts and hulls of premium tugboats, fishing boats and other working [[boat]]s.

The most ubiquitous use, from the point of view of the average person, is that most of the silver-coloured modern circulation coins are cupronickel.  A typical mix is 75% copper, 25% nickel, and a trace amount of manganese. In the past true [[silver]] [[coin]]s were [[debasement|debased]] with cupronickel.

It is used in [[thermocouple]]s, and a 55% copper/45% nickel alloy is used to make very accurate [[resistor]]s.

[[Monel]] metal is a copper-nickel alloy, containing up to 65% nickel.

See also [[bronze]] (copper alloyed with [[tin]]), [[brass]] (copper alloyed with [[zinc]]), and [[nickel silver]] (another group of copper-nickel alloys).

The cupronickel alloy technology has been known by the Chinese since the 3rd century BC under the name "White copper" (some weapons from the [[Warring States Period]] were in copper-nickel alloy <sup><small>[[#External links|1]]</small></sup>).

The [[Greco-Bactrian]] kings [[Agathocles of Bactria|Agathocles]] and [[Pantaleon]] were the first in the world to issue copper-nickel (75/25 ratio) coins <sup><small>[[#External links|2]]</small></sup> around [[170 BC]], suggesting that exchanges of the metallic alloy, or possibly exchanges of technicians, were happening at the time between China and the region of Bactria. The practice of exporting Chinese metals, in particular iron, for trade is attested around that period. 

Cupro-nickel was not used again in coinage until the [[19th century]].  It has been used in quarters and dimes in all made after 1965.

Beginning around the turn of the 20th century, [[bullet]] jackets were commonly made from this material. It was soon replaced with [[gilding metal]] to reduce metal fouling in the bore.
