'''Larry David''' (born [[July 2]] [[1947]]) is an [[Emmy]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[writer]], [[comedian]], [[Television producer|producer]] and [[film director]] born and raised in the [[Sheepshead Bay]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]. David was co-creator, head writer and executive producer (as well as the voice of [[George Steinbrenner]]) for the [[television series]] ''[[Seinfeld]]''. He also created and stars in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]''.

David, a former [[standup comedian]], was a writer and cast member for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Fridays]]'' television series from [[1980]] to [[1982]], and a writer for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from [[1984]] to [[1985]]. During his time at SNL, David only managed to get one of his sketches on the show &mdash; the last sketch of the night (where the weaker sketches are usually scheduled). David quit his writing job at SNL mid-season, only to show up to work a few days later to act as though nothing had happened (and stayed through the rest of the season). David met his future ''Seinfeld'' stars during this early stage of his career: he worked with [[Michael Richards]] (Kramer) on ''Fridays'' and with [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] (Elaine) during his one-year stint on ''SNL''.
His ''SNL'' experiences inspired a season two episode of ''Seinfeld'' entitled "[[The Revenge (Seinfeld episode)|The Revenge]]". 
David graduated from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], with bachelors degrees in history ([[1970]]) and business ([[1971]]).

On [[March 31]], [[1993]], David married [[Laurie David|Laurie Lennard]]; they have two daughters named Cazzie and Romy, and they live in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California|Pacific Palisades, California]]. Like her counterpart in ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'', Laurie is an [[Environmentalist|environmental activist]].  Since [[May 2005]], the couple have each been contributing bloggers at [[The Huffington Post]].<ref> Jones, William. Generation Hex. Jason Louv (Editor). The Disinformation Company.

==''Seinfeld''==
{{main|Seinfeld}}
In [[1989]], David teamed up with [[comedian]] [[Jerry Seinfeld]] to create NBC's ''The Seinfeld Chronicles'' (later retitled ''[[Seinfeld]]''), which was to become one of the most successful shows in television history. David occasionally appeared on the show, and was the primary inspiration for the show's [[George Costanza]] character. David left ''Seinfeld'' on amicable terms after the seventh season but did return to write the series finale in [[1998]] two years later, as well as continually providing the voice for the character of George Steinbrenner. Although he subsequently stopped writing, his function as executive producer is considered to have defined ''Seinfeld''. 

The commercial success of ''Seinfeld'' has made creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld multimillionaires, with syndication and DVD releases earning them hundreds of millions of dollars.  Larry David is estimated to have netted over $200 million from ''Seinfeld'' alone.<ref>''Who's the richest? Seinfeld'', [http://www.s-t.com/daily/03-99/03-08-99/a03wn020.htm], The Associated Press, 1999</ref>

David was nominated for an Emmy award 19 times for Seinfeld, winning twice, once for best comedy and once for writing.

==''Curb Your Enthusiasm''==
{{Main|Curb Your Enthusiasm}}
In [[1999]], the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] [[cable television]] channel aired David's special, ''[[Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', a hybrid work using story outlines and improvised dialogue, shot in a '[[mockumentary]]' style. Before it aired, HBO had suggested that David commit to a series using the same method. The result, ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', first aired in [[2000]].  It revisits many of the themes first brought up in ''[[Seinfeld]]'', albeit in a markedly different style.  Because it is on HBO, the show can explore slightly more explicit themes (examples include a pubic hair being stuck in David's throat, and a woman keeping a baseball in her vagina) and dialogue (the show contains swearing). The overall gist of the show consists of David being socially inadequate in Los Angeles, and ending up ruining every relationship, environment or situation he's in. Alongside David is his wife Cheryl (played by [[Cheryl Hines]]), his manager Jeff (played by [[Jeff Garlin]]), and Jeff's wife Susie (played by [[Susie Essman]]). Several celebrities (including comedians [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] and  [[Wanda Sykes]]) have either had recurring roles on the show or made guest appearances. For a complete list of the show's guest stars, see [[List of celebrities appearing on Curb Your Enthusiasm]].

In [[2004]], ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' was credited with helping clear a [[Los Angeles]] man named Juan Catalan of a first-degree murder charge. Catalan, who was arrested on suspicion of murder, maintained his innocence, saying he was at a [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] baseball game on [[May 12]], [[2003]], during the time of the slaying. During the game, an episode of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' was being shot in [[Dodger Stadium]] which contained footage of Juan Catalan with his daughter. When told that his show had exonerated a wrongfully accused man, Larry David commented in a ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, "I tell people that I've now done one decent thing in my life. Albeit inadvertently."<ref>{{cite web | title=Dept of Exoneration: Face in the Crowd  | work=The New Yorker | url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/06/07/040607ta_talk_toobin | accessdate=Mar 30 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

In [[2005]], David was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] in the "Best Performance By An Actor In A Television Series &mdash; Musical Or Comedy" category, for his work on the show. In the same year, fellow comedians and comedy insiders, in a poll to select ''[[The Comedian's Comedian]]'', voted him number 23 on the top fifty greatest comedy acts ever.

David was also nominated for a 2006 [[Emmy]] Best Actor Award for his work on the show. There had been speculation that the show was ending after the fifth season; however, [[Jeff Garlin]] announced that David plans to commence a sixth season. 

In a post [[Emmy]] show for E! News on August 27, 2006, [[Cheryl Hines]] confirmed that the sixth season would begin filming in October 2006; however, she is uncertain of the air date.

==Other projects==
David has also appeared in minor parts in two [[Woody Allen]] films, ''[[Radio Days]]'' (1987) and ''[[New York Stories]]'' (1989).  He was considered for the part that went to [[Billy Bob Thornton]] in ''[[Bad Santa]]'', and also played an angry version of himself to agent Ari Gold ([[Jeremy Piven]]) on ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]''.

David wrote and directed the [[1998]] film ''[[Sour Grapes (film)|Sour Grapes]]'', about two cousins who feud over a casino jackpot. It was neither a commercial nor critical success.

Since his daughters are ''[[Hannah Montana (TV series)|Hannah Montana]]'' fans, David, along with them, will guest star in a future episode of the [[Disney Channel]] show as themselves.
