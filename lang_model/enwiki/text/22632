'''Daniel Perkins Smith Paul''' (July 22, 1924 <U+2013> January 24, 2010) was an American attorney best known for arguing the landmark case ''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'' before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The decision established the principle that government could not force a newspaper to publish content.

Paul was born in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], grew up in [[Daytona]], Florida, and was educated at Harvard University, receiving degrees in law and public administration. Setting up practice in [[Miami]], Florida, he specialized in [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and environmental law. His clients included the [[Miami Dolphins]] of [[American football]] and newspapers such as ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. For his active role in city politics, Paul was nicknamed "the father of Metro".

== Legal career ==
Paul began to practice in [[Miami]], Florida in 1949 with the firm of Loftin, Anderson, Scott, McCarthy and Preston. In 1954 he formed a partnership with Francis Sams, specializing in corporate law. Over the next decade, he established himself as one of Miami's most prominent attorneys. In 1966, the ''[[Miami News]]'' called him "Dade's knight" and wrote of him that "the name Dan Paul comes up in so many civic controversies that it is hard to keep up with him".<ref name=MN>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aZgzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=720,1639519&dq=miami+herald+dan+paul&hl=en |title=It's Cause that Refreshes Dade's Knight, Dan Paul |author=Haines Colbert |date=December 22, 1966 |work=The Miami News |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> Paul eventually became known as "the father of Metro".<ref name=MN2>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rNYzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cusFAAAAIBAJ&pg=966,2972706&dq=dan-paul+stab&hl=en |title=Attorney Dan Paul stabbed at home |author=Arthur Golden |date=January 9, 1980 |work=Miami News |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>

In 1967, a suit filed by Paul against a plan to reapportion and expand the [[Florida Legislature]] reached the US Supreme Court. The Court struck down the plan. Paul stated that he had filed the suit because "it would greatly hurt the future of Florida to let the Legislature grow to such monstrous proportions that we would cease to have effective government."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TWMzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K-oFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4444,1779405&dq=dan-paul+miami&hl=en |title=Where Do We Go From Here? |date=January 9, 1967 |work=The Miami Herald |accessdate=April 24, 2013 }}</ref> 

One of Paul's specialties was environmental law, and he represented the [[National Audubon Society]] in a late-1960s lawsuit to stop an airport from being constructed in the [[Florida Everglades]], a protected region of subtropical [[wetlands]].<ref name=obit /> He also acted as a parks activist, protesting the removal of sidewalks designed by Brazilian architect [[Roberto Burle Marx]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108020544.html |title=Preparation for Miami Auto Race Removes Sections of Famous Architect's Work |date=September 22, 2003 |publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=24 April 2013}}</ref> Paul played a major role in amending Miami's city code to block the construction of buildings within fifty feet of the shore.<ref name=obit />

By the end of their practice, 28 percent of Paul and Thomson's time was devoted to [[pro bono]] work. However, the partners split acrimoniously in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-77110978.html |title=Prominent Miami Lawyer Joins Local Office of Washington Firm |date=August 11, 2011 |publisher=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=24 April 2013}}</ref> In the 1970s and '80s, Paul also acted as general counsel for the [[Miami Dolphins]] of [[American football]].<ref name=obit />

Tornillo]]'', a 1974 US Supreme Court case.<ref name=obit /><ref>''[[Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo]]'', {{ussc|418|241|1974}}</ref> In the case, a political candidate, Pat Tornillo Jr., had requested that the ''Herald'' print his rebuttal to an editorial criticizing him, citing Florida's "right-to-reply" law, which mandated that newspapers print such responses.
