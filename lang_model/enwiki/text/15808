A '''phylogenetic network''' is any [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]] used to visualize evolutionary relationships (either [[abstract object|abstractly]] or explicitly)<ref name="phylogenetic networks">Huson, DH and Scornavacca, C (2011). A survey of combinatorial methods for phylogenetic networks Genome Biology and Evolution, 3:23-35.</ref> between [[nucleotide sequence]]s, [[gene]]s, [[chromosome]]s, [[genome]]s, or [[species]].<ref name="network">D. H. Huson, R. Rupp and C. Scornavacca, [http://www.phylogenetic-networks.org/ Phylogenetic Networks], Cambridge University Press (2010).</ref>  They are employed when reticulate events such as [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]], [[horizontal gene transfer]], [[genetic recombination|recombination]], or [[gene duplication]] and loss are believed to be involved. They differ from [[phylogenetic trees]] by the explicit modeling, by means of the addition of hybrid nodes (nodes with two parents) instead of only tree nodes (nodes with only one parent).<ref name="char_reticulate">{{cite journal|coauthors=Miguel Arenas, Gabriel Valiente, and David Posada|date=2008-10-15|title=Characterization of Reticulate Networks Based on the Coalescent with Recombination|journal=Mol Biol Evol|volume=25|issue=12|pages=2517<U+2013>2520|doi=10.1093/molbev/msn219|pmid=18927089|last1=Arenas|first1=M|pmc=2582979}}</ref> [[Phylogenetic tree]]s are a subset of [[phylogenetic]] networks.

Many kinds and subclasses of phylogenetic networks have been defined based on the biological phenomenon they represent or which data they are built from (hybridization networks, usually built from rooted trees, recombination networks from binary sequences, [[median graph|median networks]] from a set of [[Split (phylogenetics)|split]]s, optimal realizations and reticulograms from a [[distance matrix]]), or restrictions to get computationally tractable problems (galled trees, and their generalizations level-k phylogenetic networks, tree-child or tree-sibling phylogenetic networks).

==Microevolution==
Phylogenetic trees also have trouble depicting [[microevolution]]ary events, for example the geographical distribution of muskrat or fish populations of a given species among river networks, because there is no [[species]] boundary to prevent gene flow between populations.  Therefore, a more general phylogenetic network better depicts these situations.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid = 12028728 | year = 2002 | month = Apr | author = Legendre, P; Makarenkov, V | title = Reconstruction of biogeographic and evolutionary networks using reticulograms | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 199<U+2013>216 | issn = 1063-5157 | doi = 10.1080/10635150252899725 | journal = Systematic Biology | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>

==Rooted vs unrooted==
;Unrooted phylogenetic network
:Let X be a set of [[taxon|taxa]]. An unrooted phylogenetic network N on X is any undirected graph whose leaves are [[bijective]]ly labeled by the taxa in X. A number of different types of unrooted phylogenetic networks are in use like [[split networks]] and [[quasi-median networks]].

;Rooted phylogenetic network
:Let X be a set of taxa. A rooted phylogenetic network N on X is a rooted DAG where the set of leaves is bijectively labeled by the taxa in X.
