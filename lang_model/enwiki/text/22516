The '''Atlantic Star''' is a military campaign medal, instituted by the [[United Kingdom]] in May 1945 for award to subjects of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] for service in the [[Second World War]], specifically those that took part in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], the longest continuous campaign of the war.<ref name="Blair1">{{Citation |last=Blair |first=Clay, Jr. |title=Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunters 1939<U+2013>1942 |publisher=Cassell & Co. |year=1996 |isbn=0-304-35260-8}}</ref><ref name="Blair2">{{Citation |last=Blair |first=Clay, Jr. |title=Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunted 1942<U+2013>1945 |publisher=Cassell & Co. |year=1996 |isbn=0-304-35261-6}}</ref>

Two clasps were instituted to be worn on the medal ribbon, the '''Air Crew Europe Clasp''' and the '''France and Germany Clasp'''.<ref name="Stratford"/>

==The Second World War Stars==
Altogether eight campaign stars and nine clasps were initially instituted for campaign service during the Second World War. On 8 July 1943 the [[1939<U+2013>1945 Star]] and the [[Africa Star]] were the first two of these Stars to be instituted. One more campaign star, the [[Arctic Star]], and one more clasp, the Bomber Command Clasp, were belatedly added on 26 February 2013, more than sixty-seven years after the end of the war.<ref name="Stratford">[http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/wwii_medals.htm Stephen Stratford Medals site - British Military & Criminal History - 1900 to 1999 - Atlantic Star] (Access date 1 April 2015)</ref><ref name="Hansard2">[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1943/aug/03/war-service-decorations War Service (Decorations) - Statement in the House of Commons by Winston Churchill on 3 August 1943 (HC Deb 03 August 1943 vol 391 cc2091-3)] (Access date 9 April 2015)</ref><ref name="BomberCommand">[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140805133045/http://www.veterans-uk.info/arctic_star_index.htm The National Archives - Ministry of Defence - Arctic Star and Bomber Command Clasp] (Access date 1 April 2015)</ref>

Only one of these campaign stars, the 1939<U+2013>1945 Star, covered the full duration of the Second World War from its outbreak on 3 September 1939 to the victory over Japan on 2 September 1945.<ref name="NewZealand1939-45"/>

No-one could be awarded more than five (now six) campaign stars and no-one could be awarded more than one clasp to any one campaign star. Five of the nine (now ten) clasps were the equivalents of their namesake campaign stars and were awarded for the same respective campaigns as those stars, to be worn on the ribbon of that campaign star of the applicable group that had been earned first. The maximum of six possible campaign stars are the following:<ref name="Stratford"/><ref name="BomberCommand"/><ref name="Regulations">{{cite web|last=Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals in Time of War|title=Campaign Stars and the Defence Medal (Regulations)|url=http://www.northeastmedals.co.uk/britishguide/hmso/campaign_stars_defence.htm|publisher=HM Stationery Office|accessdate=2010-08-01|location=London|date=May 1945}}</ref>

Since only the first of the Atlantic Star, Air Crew Europe Star and France and Germany Star to be earned could be awarded to any one individual, the possible Star and Clasp combinations for these three campaign stars are:<ref name="Stratford"/>
* The Atlantic Star with either the Air Crew Europe Clasp or the France and Germany Clasp.
* The Air Crew Europe Star with either the France and Germany Clasp or the Atlantic Clasp.
* The France and Germany Star with the Atlantic Clasp. As a result of the different date ranges involved, the earlier period Air Crew Europe Clasp could not be added to the later period France and Germany Star.<ref name="Stratford"/>

==Institution==
The Battle of the Atlantic took place between 3 September 1939 and 8 May 1945, as German U boats attacked convoys transporting vital supplies from America and the Colonies to Britain. Battleships of the Royal Navy and aircraft of the Royal Air Force escorted these convoys, hunted the U boats and, despite some notable successes by the U boats, won a comprehensive victory in the Atlantic.<ref name="GovUK"/>

The Atlantic Star was instituted in May 1945 to commemorate the Battle of the Atlantic and  was intended primarily for award to those who served in shipping convoys and their escorts and anti-submarine forces, as well as to those who served on fast merchant ships that sailed alone. Two clasps were instituted to be worn on the Atlantic Star's medal ribbon, the Air Crew Europe Clasp and the France and Germany Clasp.<ref name="Stratford"/><ref name="Regulations"/><ref name="NewZealandAtlantic"/><ref name="Canada"/><ref name="NewZealanders">[http://medals.nzdf.mil.nz/category/h/h10.html NZDF Medals site New Zealand Defence Force - British Commonwealth War And Campaign Medals Awarded To New Zealanders - The Atlantic Star] (Access date 4 April 2015)</ref>

British uniform regulations stipulated that no one person could be awarded more than one clasp to any one campaign star, and neither the [[Air Crew Europe Star]] nor the [[France and Germany Star]] could be awarded to a recipient of the Atlantic Star. Subsequent entitlement to either of these two stars was denoted by the award of either the Air Crew Europe Clasp or the France and Germany Clasp to the Atlantic Star. Regulations further stipulated that only the first clasp earned could be worn with the medal.<ref name="Stratford"/>

==Award criteria==
===Broad criteria===
The qualifying areas for the award of the Atlantic Star were the Atlantic and Home waters excluding the Mediterranean, the south Atlantic between the longitude of Cape Horn and longitude 20<U+00B0> East (South Africa), and the convoy routes to ports in North Russia.<ref name="NewZealandAtlantic"/><ref name="NationalArchives"/>

The Atlantic Star was awarded for six months service afloat in the Atlantic or in home waters within the period from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945. It was also awarded to air crew who had taken part in operations against the enemy at sea within the qualifying areas, subject to having served for two months in an operational unit. The [[1939<U+2013>1945 Star]] must have already been earned by six months service, or two months for air crew, before commencing qualifying service for the Atlantic Star.<ref name="Stratford"/><ref name="NewZealandAtlantic"/><ref name="GovUK">[https://www.gov.uk/medals-campaigns-descriptions-and-eligibility#atlantic-star GOV.UK - Defence and armed forces <U+2013> guidance - Medals: campaigns, descriptions and eligibility - Atlantic Star] (Access date 3 April 2015)</ref><ref name="Canada">[http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/medals-decorations/campaign-stars-medals-1939-1954/atstar Veterans Affairs Canada - Atlantic Star] (Access date 4 April 2015)</ref><ref name="NewZealanders"/><ref name="NationalArchives"/><ref name="WarRecords"/>

Merchant seaman also qualified for the award of the medal, also on condition that the 1939<U+2013>1945 Star must have already been earned. They were required to have served in the Atlantic, home waters, North Russia Convoys or the South Atlantic.<ref name="Stratford"/><ref name="NewZealandAtlantic"/><ref name="NationalArchives">[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/merchant-seamen-medals-ww2.htm The National Archives - Merchant seamen's campaign medal records 1939-1945] (Access date 2 April 2015)</ref>

===Special criteria===
The award of a gallantry medal or [[Mentioned in dispatches|Mention in Dispatches]] for action while serving in the qualifying areas, qualified the recipient for the immediate award of the Atlantic Star, regardless of service duration. Personnel whose required qualifying service period in the qualifying areas was terminated prematurely by their death, disability or wounding due to service were awarded the Star regardless of service duration.<ref name="Stratford"/><ref name="GovUK"/><ref name="NationalArchives"/><ref name="Battles&Medals">Joslin, Litherland, and Simpkin (eds), ''British Battles and Medals'', (1988), Spink.</ref><ref name="Birkenhead"/>

Certain special conditions also applied governing the award of the Atlantic Star for those Naval personnel who had entered service in the qualifying sea area less than six months before the end of the qualifying period, provided it was the last operational theatre in which they served.<ref name="GovUK"/><ref name="NewZealanders"/>

==Order of wear==
The order of wear of the nine campaign stars was determined firstly by their respective campaign start dates, secondly by the campaign's duration and thirdly by their dates of institution.<ref name="London Gazette"/>

===South Africa===
{{main|South African military decorations order of precedence#Order of precedence}}
Until 5 April 1952 the position of the Atlantic Star in the official order of precedence was prescribed by the British [[Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood]]. With effect from 6 April 1952, when a new South African set of decorations and medals was instituted to replace most of the British awards used to date, the older awards continued to be worn in the same order of precedence but, with the exception of the [[Victoria Cross]], took precedence after all South African orders, decorations and medals awarded to South Africans on or after that date.<ref name="London Gazette">{{londongazette|issue=56878|supp=y|startpage=3352|date=17 March 2003}}</ref><ref name="Notice1982">Government Notice no. 1982 of 1 October 1954 - ''Order of Precedence of Orders, Decorations and Medals'', published in the Government Gazette of 1 October 1954.</ref><ref name="Gazette 27376">Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, {{OCLC|72827981}}</ref>

Both clasps were struck in bronze and have a frame with an inside edge that resembles the perforated edge of a postage stamp. They are inscribed "AIR CREW EUROPE" and "FRANCE AND GERMANY" respectively and were designed to be sewn onto the medal's ribbon. Regulations only allow one clasp, the first earned, to be worn with the Star.
